a private investigator hired by hank 
williams jrs manager says there is evidence to support the 
singers claim that someone slipped him drugs before a concert he 
failed to complete 
williams performed a makeup concert tuesday night before an 
enthusiastic sellout crowd of about 10000 people in baton rouge 
la where on may 6 he failed to finish a single song cursed and 
stumbled offstage after 20 minutes 
at about the same point in tuesday nights performance he 
interrupted the music to repeat his claims that someone else was at 
fault 
i dont carry bodyguards around but im going to have to 
after what happened here williams said 
mr williams explanation may not seem believable to some 
however in this case there is evidence that lends support to his 
explanation said a report by private investigator bruce 
childers the report was released monday by kathy gangwisch a 
spokeswoman for williams 
the report by childers said blood and urine tests taken four 
days after the concert were positive for a foreign substance 
available only by prescription and which mr williams stated he did 
not take or possess 
the substance was valium ms gangwisch said the report also 
quotes witnesses not associated with the singer as saying williams 
underwent a drastic mood change in less than an hour after arriving 
at his hotel 
two days after the concert kent arwood a publicist for 
williams said the threetime academy of country music entertainer 
of the year told him someone slipped drugs or something into 
his drink 
arwood said williams told him he knew what it was like to be 
drunk and he wasnt drunk 
asked if the report couldnt simply mean that williams had taken 
valium himself ms gangwisch said that could have been except 
that he doesnt even take aspirin

two major hightechnology companies and a 
leading research university announced tuesday that they are forming 
a consortium to develop commercial uses for superconductors 
the consortium consists of american telephone amp telegraph corp 
international business machines and the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
other companies universities and government institutions will 
be invited to join the consortium the three said 
superconductors are ceramic materials that are cooled to beyond 
minus 200 degrees fahrenheit at which point they can let 
electricity pass through them without resistance 
both the united states and japan are researching superconductors 
and if they are developed they could have a wide variety of 
commercial applications 
the united states now has an advantage in basic research on 
superconductors the consortiums goal is to make sure american 
firms rather than those from japan have the advantage in 
commercial application of the research 
this will be a consortium of open communication among the 
researchers involved the three organizations said in a joint 
statement the combining of their scientific knowledge and their 
knowledge of applications will benefit the nation 
the new organization will be called the consortium for 
superconducting electronics researchers will remain at their 
present locations but will share information 
according to the washington post the group was formed at the 
advice of the white house science council which said in january 
that such an organization was needed if the united states wanted to 
avoid what occurred in laser and videotape technology 
both were created in the united states but were commercially 
exploited by japan 
the consortium announced that research efforts will be 
concentrated in four areas including signal distribution 
hightemperature materials and technology advanced devices and 
integrated circuits and junctions 
the consortium will focus on applying superconductor technology 
to highspeed microelectronic devices for use in computers 
telecommunications and military systems the new york times 
reported in wednesdays editions 
it is a model of how universities government labs and 
industry have to cooperate in the future to address a number of 
issues mit provost john deutch told the times 
ralph e gomory ibm senior vice president for science and 
technology said the consortium would seek 4 million to 6 million 
in financing from a defense department research agency most of 
which would go to mit 
ibm and atampt already have substantial programs in 
superconductivity the times said 
robert c dynes director of chemical physics research at atampt 
bell laboratories told the times that consortium organizers 
thought having big organizations involved would give the group 
weight to attract other members 
i dont regard this as the big guys banding together and 
wiping out the little guys as much as giving the little guys an 
ability to get in the same building as us he said

stauchly anticommunist south korea 
today opened a new library featuring 10000 books periodicals and 
films on rival north korea and other communist nations 
the library located in a downtown post office includes 4500 
books and documents on communist ideology and 50 magazines and 
daily newspapers such as pravda from the soviet union it also has 
5000 books and 300 films on communist north korea a spokesman 
said 
the national unification board said the library was opened to 
meet a growing demand for information as a result of the increasing 
contacts and trade relations between south korea and communist 
countries 
south korea has been strongly anticommunist since the division 
of the korean peninsula into the communist north and the capitalist 
south at the end of world war ii 
the seoul government has diplomatic relations with only one 
communist nation hungary but has encouraged trade contacts with 
others as a means to ease tension on the peninsula

a federal jury convicted two men of 
extortion racketeering and fraud in a billiondollar north slope 
construction boom in the early 80s the longest criminal trial in 
alaskan history 
lewis dischner and carl mathisen were convicted of using their 
influential positions as advisers to former north slope borough 
mayor eugene brower to take in millions of dollars in kickbacks and 
steer construction contracts to companies they secretly owned 
dischner 71 and mathisen 56 listened impassively as us 
district judge h russel holland read the lengthy list of verdicts 
dischner was convicted on 21 counts of racketeering extortion 
and wire and mail fraud and acquitted on four incometax charges 
mathisen was convicted on 22 counts 
were obviously pleased said us attorney michael spaan 
we hope that it will change the way that business is done in 
alaska 
dischners attorney douglas pope lashed out at spaan and the 
team of state and federal prosecutors who handled the case 
accusing them of railroading his client 
there are some ambitious prosecutors who saw an opportunity to 
take lew dischners scalp and make a career out of it pope said 
pope and mathisens lawyer laurence finegold said their 
clients would appeal 
the complicated trial lasted more than seven months and the 
11member jury deliberated for more than three weeks one juror was 
dismissed after being injured in a horsebackriding accident 
holland rejected defense requests for a mistrial saying federal 
court rules allow 11member juries under special circumstances 
prosecutors said the two men pocketed 21 million while brower 
was mayor from 1981 to 1984 they said 3 million came from their 
salaries 9 million from contracts with companies dischner and 
mathisen owned and 9 million from a 10 percent fee assessed all 
companies doing business with the borough 
prosecutors said payments to dischner and mathisen added 73 
million to the cost of the boroughs massive contruction program 
an attempt to provide 20th century amenities in the harsh arctic 
environment 
the government claimed dischner and mathisen manipulated brower 
an eskimo leader they characterized as naive brower testified for 
the government as part of a plea bargain 
he admitted lying to the grand jury to protect dischner and 
mathisen but said he had a change of heart when he learned the 
extent of their secret financial interests brower was sentenced to 
30 days in jail and fined 5000 for tax evasion 
defense lawyers attributed the inflated cost of the boroughs 
capital construction to difficult working conditions a rush to 
finish the work and the brower administrations desire to create 
jobs 
they admitted dischner and mathisen made money during browers 
term but insisted it was legitimate 
government witnesses told of lavish gifts showered on brower and 
other borough officials to cement dischner and mathisens influence 
clothes gambling junkets boats guns sporting goods 
expensive homeremodeling projects cars and a flashy 45000 
diamond ring were among the currency of corruption prosecutors and 
government witnesses said 
but defense attorneys said the gifts were misinterpeted because 
of profound cultural differences they said dischner and mathisen 
were godfathers to browers children and that in the inupiat 
society sharing is fundamental 
spaan said there will be a forfeiture trial to determine what 
if any assets dischner and mathisen will have to surrender to the 
government no date has been set for that trial 
the two men will be sentenced in august or september holland 
said 
dischner once was one of the states most powerful lobbyists he 
was labor commissioner under the late gov bill egan and a 
longtime labor and democratic party activist 
mathisen has north slope ties dating back to the early 1970s 
others were snared with dischner mathisen and brower 
former public works director irving igtanloc pleaded guilty to 
tax evasion in return for his testimony three engineers and 
architects implicated in the investigation are scheduled to go on 
trial later this year 
the trial also triggered an ethics investigation into the 
activities of democratic state sen al adams who was chairman of 
the house finance committee with control over state spending in the 
borough during the early 1980s 
the murder trial of john kenneth peel in state court last year 
which lasted six months was the longest previous criminal trial

popular gov thomas h kean ended nearly a 
year of speculation monday and said he will not endorse a candidate 
in the heated republican primary to succeed him 
the gop governor said in a statement that he had watched the 
candidates in three televised debates and felt any of the four 
leading contenders would make a good competitor in the fall general 
election and a good governor 
kean who by law cannot seek a third consecutive term urged 
voters to concentrate on what the candidates are saying the 
positions they are adopting and the solutions they are proposing 
with most polls showing up to half of the republican primary 
voters undecided an endorsement by kean was widely considered to 
be a key weapon in swaying voters at the polls june 6 
some campaigns have said keans backing could help deliver up to 
30000 votes a significant boost for an election in which some 
believe as few as 100000 votes may be enough to secure the 
nomination 
kean spokesman carl golden said the governor weighed the 
candidacies of former attorney general cary edwards rep james 
courter sen william gormley and assembly speaker chuck hardwick 
polls show the four men have a significant lead over a fifth 
candidate sen gerald cardinale who has said he did not want the 
backing of the moderate governor 
an endorsement would have been a tough decision for kean because 
all four men have close ties to the governor 
courter ran keans 1981 and 1985 campaigns and edwards has been 
a top adviser gormley has been a loyal point man in the senate and 
hardwick helped push many kean initiatives through the assembly 
before breaking with the governor over several issues in the past 
year 
the decision was greeted happily by the hardwick campaign which 
was considered the least likely to get keans endorsement 
the other campaigns all said they would have welcomed an 
endorsement but have not planned strategy around the governors 
backing 
three other candidates also are seeking the gop nomination but 
are considered longshots by observers

prince philip has started a trust that 
will fund the first authorized english translations of the koran 
and other holy books 
the 7 million trust also will finance translations of the 
eastern orthodox christian bible and of texts of the bahai faith 
buddhism hinduism judaism sikhism taoism and the oral 
traditions of australian aborigines the yanamamo of south america 
and the japanese shinto faith trust organizers said monday 
the translation of the koran authorized by the moslem world 
league and religious leaders in mecca is especially significant 
because most islamic authorities believe that arabic alone is the 
language of revelation 
previous english translations often have been poor and have 
differed widely because of the difficulty of interpreting classical 
arabic 
philip duke of edinburgh and husband of britains queen 
elizabeth ii said the new international sacred literature trust 
would seek out the highest religious authorities of each faith and 
ask them to designate an approved translator for each text to 
ensure accuracy a second expert would ensure the texts literary 
grace and integrity before publication 
the trust is being financed largely with 5 million from a saudi 
arabian philanthropist mohammed said abdul jawad a former saudi 
envoy to new york london and somalia

women who took birth control pills while 
teenagers in the 1960s face about five times the usual risk of 
breast cancer before they reach menopause a study concludes 
the research conducted in sweden is one of several recent 
studies to raise concerns that the pill may increase the odds of 
breast cancer 
while describing their findings as alarming the researchers 
cautioned that birth control pills have changed substantially since 
their introduction and newer pills may not heighten the risk of 
breast cancer 
the research directed by dr hakan olsson and colleagues from 
university hospital in lund was presented monday at the annual 
meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
at the meeting an italian specialist described a new approach 
to treating breast cancer that he said could virtually eliminate 
the need for mastectomies which have been the standard approach to 
the disease for nearly a century 
breast cancer is the leading cancer killer among american women 
and strikes one in 10 
olssons study was conducted in southern sweden where the pill 
was widely used by teenage girls after its introduction in the 
1960s 
he said that the incidence of breast cancer among women under 
age 40 has risen in sweden since the advent of the pil and while 
his study cannot conclusively blame the pill we have no other 
explanation for the increase of breast cancer in young women 
however even if pill use during the 1960s has increased the 
chances of breast cancer the risk is still relatively small among 
women before they reach menopause olsson said that the overall 
chance of breast cancer before menopause is about 1 percent while 
the risk among early pill users is about 5 percent 
the increased risk appears to be limited to those who began 
taking the pill while young the research found no increased breast 
cancer among women who started on the pill after age 25 or after 
their first fullterm pregnancy 
olsson said 10 studies since 1983 have reported links between 
the pill and breast cancer 
dr jules harris director of rush cancer in chicago said the 
swedish study strongly suggests that birth control pills are 
linked to early premenopausal breast cancer 
despite the mounting research evidence however some experts 
have been skeptical in january a panel convened by the us food 
and drug administration concluded that the reported links between 
the pill and breast cancer were still inconclusive 
doctors also point out that the pills potential dangers must be 
balanced against its benefits for instance the pill appears to 
substantially reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus and ovaries 
olssons study was based on a comparison of 174 breast cancer 
patients with 454 healthy women besides showing that teenage pill 
users were five times more likely to get breast cancer the study 
found that their tumors were larger and their outlook worse than in 
those who had not used the pill so early in life 
in a report on changes in treating breast cancer dr gianni 
bonadonna of the national cancer institute in italy described his 
initial results in 97 patients with a new approach to avoiding 
mastectomy 
although doctors are increasingly removing just the cancerous 
lump when the tumor is small total removal of the breast remains 
the standard therapy for larger tumors 
bonadonna and colleagues are experimenting with giving 
chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the lumps then surgeons are 
able to take out just the tumor and leave the rest of the breast 
this approach worked in 87 percent of women with large tumors 
who otherwise would have needed mastectomies 
bonadonna acknowledged that his approach is likely to be 
controversial and more followup will be needed many doctors 
believe that mastectomy still gives women the best chance of 
avoiding recurring cancer later in life even if their tumors are 
relatively small

in china the shelves are full of consumer 
goods but the streets are filled with political dissent in the 
soviet union the shelves are mostly empty but much of the 
political griping remains confined to meeting halls 
the contrast is unlikely to have been lost on soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev during his justcompleted visit to china say 
us experts on the two communist giants 
i imagine that gorbachev is saying that his way is not such a 
bad idea says ed hewett an expert on the soviet economy at the 
brookings institution in washington 
his reforms have allowed the society to let off some steam 
hewett said thus gorbachev can tell conservatives that the soviet 
union needs political reforms to avoid cataclysmic unrest and he 
can tell radicals that if ou go too fast if you take off all the 
controls you can lose it all 
the unreformed soviet economy is in shambles but gorbachev 
still has a firm grip on power it is hard to say the same for 
chinese leader deng xiaoping 
deng began economic reforms a decade ago by gradually 
introducing a pluralistic economy in which major enterprises are 
run by the state but farmers small manufacturers and cooperatives 
set their own production rates political reforms have been modest 
but real economic growth has been a phenomenal 10 percent 
gorbachev by contrast found that entrenched communist party 
officials blocked his early efforts at economic reform his 
solution was glasnost or greater openness allowing the media to 
uncover corruption and waste in the bureaucracy 
although he has consolidated power gorbachev has balked at the 
two critical elements of the chinese economic reform 
decollectivizing agriculture and eliminating the artificial 
subsidized price system 
on the chinese side the economic accomplishments were 
considerable in the first 10 years but part of the reason for the 
student discontent is that problems arise inflation corruption 
and things of that kind said a doak barnett china scholar at 
the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies in 
washington 
the inflation rate in china after price reform has been about 30 
percent said kenneth liberthal director of chinese studies at the 
university of michigan 
deng unlike gorbachev took power when his country was in 
crisis after the turmoil of the 196676 cultural revolution that 
severely weakened the chinese equivalent of the apparatchiks that 
blocked soviet economic reforms said liberthal 
the apparatchiks had been clobbered said liberthal deng 
went at the economic restructuring with a vengeance so the chinese 
economic reform has gone far beyond what the soviets have done 
the dilemma shared by reformers in moscow and beijing is the 
fate of the communist party when it loosens its grip on politics 
as in the soviet union or on the economy as in china 
former secretary of state henry kissinger credits deng with 
starting a pluralistic economic system and the political 
consequences were inevitable they came too fast for his own 
reputation in history for the stability of his country 
soviet conservatives might draw the conclusion that if 
liberalization goes beyond a certain point the party loses 
control and in fact it is inherent in the economic reform that 
the party must lose control because if the party no longer runs 
the economy what other function does it have they become 
supernumeraries kissinger said on abctv sunday 
gorbachev ostensibly is trying to transfer some power from the 
communist party to parliamentary structures such as the congress 
of peoples deputies scheduled to meet for the first time this 
week 
but it is by no means clear how much power will go to the 
government which in russia has been a poor relative of the mighty 
communist party said dmitri simes a soviet emigre at the carnegie 
endowment for peace in washington 
there is a great deal of experimentation going on under 
gorbachev simes told a congressional panel last week it not as 
though he knows exactly what he wants to do 
the role of the party in china has also been changing because 
reforms have weakened its control over economic decisionmaking 
because there have been some political reforms and because of 
negative feelings built up during the cultural revolution 
in fact there has been very considerable liberalization in 
china said barnett the students are asking the leaders to 
move ahead with reforms that they have already committed themselves 
to 
you could not have had this mass demonstration in china if 
there had not been a loosening up it is true that the leadership 
in china has been more cautious about political change and has 
tried to do it incrementally but these things do develop a 
momentum

the nations energy chief is urging a federal 
appeals court to permit nuclear testing at the seabrook nh 
plant warning that the power is desperately needed for a region 
that could be battered by brownouts this summer 
energy secretary james d watkins filed an affidavit with the 
us circuit court of appeals here monday supporting the nuclear 
regulatory commissions plan to issue a lowpower operating license 
to seabrook the subject of intense battles between pro and 
antinuclear forces for more than a decade 
new england urgently needs the power that seabrook is ready to 
provide and there are no satisfactory nearterm alternative 
sources of supply said the retired navy admiral in entering the 
latest battle in the 20year war over seabrook any unnecessary 
delay in bringing this plant online would be quite simply bad 
energy policy and flatly inconsistent with the public interest 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis attorney general james 
shannon and other seabrook opponents are asking the court for an 
emergency order blocking the license until a full appeal can be 
heard 
last week the nrc said the license could be issued thursday 
afternoon in the absence of a court order it was not known when 
the court would rule 
seabrook critics say the coastal area around the southern new 
hampshire reactor cannot be evacuated quickly they also charge 
that public service company of new hampshire the plants principal 
owner is financially unsound to run the plant public service 
filed for federal bankruptcy protection last year 
watkins in his sevenpage affidavit did not address safety and 
financial concerns but instead stressed regional power needs and 
national energy security 
without seabrook the region could fall below the 20 percent 
surplus energy standard later this year even if it experiences 
only moderate growth in demand watkins warned 
during the past year in fact new england suffered repeated 
brownouts and rolling blackouts and similar emergency 
procedures will probably again become necessary as soon as this 
summer the energy secretary said 
watkins has taken an unusually high profile in arguing for both 
the seabrook plant and the shoreham nuclear plant on long island 
an unreliable electricity supply system can inhibit regional 
economic growth and diminish the quality of life of our citizens 
watkins said for new england the danger of falling below the 
point where adequate electric service can be assured is both real 
and immediate 
watkins said seabrook already a decade behind schedule could 
receive its fullpower commercial license by sept 30 
opponents however say regulatory and court challenges will put 
off a final decision on commercial operation for years the fight 
over the lowpower license has taken three years 
watkins said there is no economically sound alternative to 
seabrook coalfired plants are strongly opposed by 
environmentalists and would take at least five years to build he 
said new natural gas pipelines could not be ready until the 
mid1990s and conservation efforts cannot keep up with the regions 
rapid economic growth watkins added

a district of columbia superior court judge is 
trying to decide whether sending a juvenile back to alabama to face 
a possible death sentence would violate the districts ban on 
capital punishment 
judge stephen f eilperin has promised a ruling today on 
alabamas bid to extradite the 17yearold identified only by the 
initials om the youth is charged with arson and murder in the may 
1988 firebombing of a gadsden ala apartment that killed 
14monthold tamel jackson 
regardless of how he rules eilperin has promised to stay his 
order until next week to give the losing side a chance to challenge 
the decision before the dc court of appeals 
the youths attorney gerald fisher argued at a hearing monday 
that the district must apply legislation passed by the city council 
outlawing the death penalty to the interstate agreement governing 
juvenile extraditions 
but paul alper assistant corporation counsel for the district 
government said the councils ban on capital punishment did not 
change the citys obligation to enforce the interstate agreement 
eilperin said a major problem with the defense argument was 
that om is not threatened by the death penalty if he is tried as 
a juvenile and if alabama decides to try the boy as an adult 
eilperin said he would be obligated under the constitution to 
approve the extradition regardless of the ban on capital 
punishment 
but fisher said alabama authorities cannot certify om for 
trial as an adult which would subject him to a possible death 
sentence unless he first is returned to the state 
om has been fighting extradition since he was arrested by 
district authorities in december his uncle yul devoe guice 31 
was arrested by alabama authorities soon after the bombing and 
charged with murder and arson 
the boys grandmother alice guice thomas testified at a 
hearing last month that om who is black cannot get a fair trial 
from the white authorities of etowah county ala because the 
countys law enforcement officials have a longstanding vendetta 
against her family 
but alper argued that the fairness of the alabama judicial 
system was not at issue in the case he said district officials 
would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in alabama 
attempted to pass judgment on our system of justice 
alper also contended that if the district refused to enforce the 
interstate agreement on juvenile extraditions in this case the 
nations capital would quickly turn into a haven for fleeing 
fugitives

prices for crops and livestock have edged 
higher than agriculture department analysts expected and may boost 
farmers cash income prospects for 1989 by at least 2 billion from 
the forecast of just a month ago 
greg hanson of the departments economic research service said 
figures for the fourth quarter of 1988 showed that cash receipts 
for sales of major commodities produced on the nations farms 
were stronger than forecast initially and that the momentum 
continued into the first quarter of 1989 
our crop receipts are projected to set an alltime record in 
1989 hanson said monday in an interview there has been price 
strength in both crops and livestock 
the latest projections put 1989 cash sales of livestock at 
around 81 billion with sales of crops at 76 billion but 
expenses are rising too as farmers put more cropland back into 
production and direct federal payments to farmers decline 
nationally including all farmrelated cash receipts the gross 
cash income of farmers could be in the range of 168 billion to 
173 billion compared with about 170 billion in 1988 expenses 
are forecast at 115 billion to 119 billion compared with 113 
billion last year 
as a result hanson said farmers this year could see net cash 
income in the range of 50 billion to 55 billion that would be 
down from the 1988 record of 577 billion 
just a month ago the agency forecast 1989 net cash income at 
48 billion to 52 billion 
net cash income is the annual difference between gross cash 
income and cash operating expenses as defined by the agency it is 
the amount of money farmers have available to pay debts make 
purchases and pay for family living expenses 
net cash income during a calendar year can include proceeds from 
sales of crops produced in earlier years 
in another method of bookkeeping the agency computes net farm 
income as a measure of the net value of agricultural production 
during the calendar year whether sold or stored on the farm 
under this method changes in inventory values are taken into 
consideration along with values assigned to nonmoney income 
such as an allowance for a farm familys dwelling and other factors 
according to usdas latest projections for 1989 net farm income 
could rebound to record levels of 47 billion to 52 billion last 
year when inventories were drawn down sharply net farm income was 
about 41 billion down from 463 billion in 1987 
hansons comments followed an outlook report friday in which 
analysts said 1989 aggregate income prospects are not much 
changed from earlier forecasts except that the weather has 
shifted the distributions 
wheat farmers in areas with adequate rainfall or with large 
carryin stocks inventories will have higher incomes because 
prices are up the report said but wheat producers who were 
hit by the dry weather this winter and spring and who lack stocks 
or crop insurance will sustain losses 
some other observations in the report 
higher beef production and lower prices are expected through 
july record numbers of cattle entered feedlots in the first 
quarter of this year fewer replacement heifers may be held for 
herd expansion reflecting dry pasture conditions especially in 
some great plains states 
the federal reserves tightening of the us money supply has 
cooled the underlying inflation rate so further tightness seems 
unlikely this points to falling interest rates and a real economic 
growth rate in the range of 25 percent to 3 percent a year this 
adds up to an economic environment that should mildly support 
agriculture 
an agency economic study suggests consumers would pay 3 
billion to 5 billion more annually in the short run for tomatoes 
potatoes and tobacco if soil fumigants are banned a possibility 
being considered by the environmental protection agency

the agriculture department is instituting new 
procedures to tighten the testing and detention of readytoeat 
meat and poultry products suspected of being contaminated by the 
bacteria listeria monocytogenes 
lester m crawford head of the departments food safety and 
inspection service said monday the new policy will take effect as 
soon as the revised testing procedures are ready in about six 
weeks 
crawford said that on april 14 the centers for disease control 
confirmed the first case of human listeriosis in the united 
states caused by meat or poultry the case involved a nationwide 
recall of turkey franks made by plantation foods inc of waco 
texas 
under the listeria monitoring program the agency will increase 
the number of samples tested each year other procedures are being 
put into effect to ensure that suspected products will not reach 
consumers until the problem has been corrected he said 
the bacteria have the potential to cause serious illness 
particularly among those with weakened immune systems such as 
infants pregnant women the elderly and the chronically ill 
however crawford said healthy persons are essentially at 
little risk from the disease which can cause flulike symptoms 
including fever chills headache and sometimes abdominal pain and 
diarrhea

political unrest in japan and west germany 
presents a dilemma for the bush administration not only in the 
diplomatic arena but also in its battle against a bulging dollar 
the white house on monday took the unusual step of issuing a 
statement encouraging intervention by central government banks to 
drive down the dollars value abroad 
the step was taken in conjunction with a selloff of dollars by 
the federal reserve the bank of japan and several european central 
banks 
the decision to issue a statement was propelled by 
administration fears that too high a rise in the dollar against 
other major currencies will erase hardwon recent improvements in 
the us trade deficit 
the deficit aided by record export sales fell dramatically to 
886 billion in march a 98 percent drop from februarys 
imbalance of 982 billion according to the commerce department 
the drop continued a downward trend in the trade deficit that 
started early last year 
as the dollar goes higher against other major currencies 
imported goods become less expensive here and prices of us 
products go up abroad aggravating the trade deficit 
despite the selling of dollars by central banks the dollar has 
continued to climb surging to more than 2 west german marks and to 
140 japanese yen the upper limits of trading ranges unofficially 
set by the seven major industrial nations 
a reason for the dollars unrestrained climb is that political 
problems faced by ruling administrations in both japan and west 
germany are undermining trader confidence in the yen and the mark 
enhancing the attractiveness of the dollar 
in japan the announcement by prime minister noboru takeshita 
that he would resign to take responsibility in the payoff scandal 
that has rocked japan is causing investor unrest analysts said 
the governing partys search for a successor has been complicated 
by the scandals links to most of its senior members 
and in west germany the current dispute over nuclear 
disarmament is causing problems for chancellor helmut kohl 
although his advocacy of early ussoviet talks on eliminating 
natos shortrange nuclear missiles is posing a problem for the 
united states in the upcoming nato summit kohl is under even more 
political pressure at home to take a stronger stand against the 
missiles 
financial markets are getting nervous that kohl is going to 
lose the election and in japan we still dont know who the new 
prime minister will be said david wyss chief financial 
economist for data resources inc 
this makes people holding onto yen or marks very nervous so 
they buy dollars and the interest rate on dollars 
dollardenominated investments and securities is still very high 
compared to those in germany and japan wyss continued 
mondays white house statement by deputy press secretary roman 
popadiuk said the climbing dollar is a matter of concern that 
has also prompted questioning of the administrations commitment 
to the process of economic policy coordination among the group of 
seven major industrial democracies 
they are the united states japan west germany britain 
france italy and canada the seven have agreed to take steps to 
coordinate their economic policies including interest rate 
changes and direct intervention on exchange markets to keep major 
currencies stable 
this administration remains fully committed to this process 
the white house statement continued 
if the dollars recent rise against other major currencies is 
sustained for a prolonged period or extended it could undermine 
international efforts to reduce global trade imbalances the 
statement said 
since the white house usually does not make such comments the 
statement appeared to be designed largely for its psychological 
impact on traders analysts suggested 
the dollar is getting out of hand so they the government 
had to do something but theyre going to have to back it up with 
action to spend billions to move dollars around said michael k 
evans who heads a private washingtonbased economic consulting 
firm 
despite the white house plea and repeated centralbank selling 
however the dollar surged anew on monday hitting a new 2year 
high against the mark and a 1year high against the yen 
meanwhile treasury secretary nicholas brady said in an 
interview in mondays editions of the milwaukee journal that world 
unrest was a major factor in the dollars rise because it was 
perceived as a safe investment haven 
you have a million chinese rioting in the streets he said 
you have nato in an unsettled state of affairs you have in 
japan lack of clear definition of leadership really for the first 
time since the second world war so it doesnt surprise me that 
people pause for a moment and want to put their money in a country 
where the people have settled their leadership question brady 
said

friction between light and darkskinned blacks 
underlies an unusual federal lawsuit in which a black woman says 
she lost her job because of her light complexion 
tracy lynn morrow said she sued to get her internal revenue 
service job back and to fight prejudice within her race 
if there is this problem within our black society then i 
think we have to correct it ms morrow said monday that would 
make us stronger too i feel it would help us as a race 
earlier this month a federal judge denied a motion to dismiss 
the case ruling ms morrow could claim job discrimination if she 
could prove her supervisor also black harassed and ultimately 
fired her over skin tone 
ms morrow who turns 27 on wednesday was fired as a 
clerktypist in march 1986 last july the equal employment 
opportunity commission allowed her to sue 
ms morrow contends her supervisor ruby lewis harassed her 
soon after ms lewis was promoted in 1985 
she tortured me mentally ms morrow said i heard it said 
that the only reason i got the job was because i had light skin 
ms lewis replied in court documents that ms morrow was fired 
because of incompetence and job attitude not skin color the 
associated press was unable to locate ms lewis on monday for 
further comment 
since hues of skin have never been a consideration with me 
and i never even thought about it until tracy presented it as an 
issue in this case its impossible for me to have discriminated 
against her on that basis ms lewis said in court documents 
no trial date has been set in the lawsuit against ms lewis the 
irs and the us treasury secretary 
it apparently is the first case of its kind in the united 
states said norman harris director of the department of 
africanamerican studies at the university of georgia but 
discrimination within black society based on skin shade is not new 
there are black folks who would want to look as much like 
europeans as possible harris said because lighter skin in the 
past has brought social advantages in whitedominated society 
that attitude has sparked resentment black historian and 
sociologist web dubois wrote about the double consciousness 
of the lighterskinned black person other black authors have 
written about the tragic mulatto harris said 
this was a person who was not fully african or american who 
was confused about identity harris said its usually somebody 
who doesnt recognize the heritage of the black community 
lighterskinned blacks often received preferential treatment 
from slaveowners and a greater percentage of free blacks before 
the civil war were faircomplexioned said john m mathews a 
georgia state university history professor specializing in black 
studies 
the division continued after emancipation mathews said with 
lighter blacks finding it easier to get jobs and gain entree into 
other levels of society 
they had a bit more cachet mathews said it was a 
distinction that black people often made among themselves 
in the 1987 movie school daze filmmaker spike lee 
satirically portrayed a campus rivalry between lighterskinned 
blacks who try to enter whitedominated society by taking on white 
traits and darker blacks who view them with disdain 
ms morrows case has stirred debate among atlantas blacks 
about whether variations in skin tone still trigger any racial 
prejudice and resentment 
radio station wveefm held a callin show monday on the case 
producer nate quick said calls ran about 2to1 against ms morrow 
with most callers saying racial prejudice between blacks is not 
widespread 
most people said this was an isolated thing quick said 
but there were some who said theyd run into the same kind of 
thing in their jobs 
ms morrow said she expects some criticism from blacks concerned 
about the image projected by the case 
she added we have come a long way since we were treated like 
animals and we have to stick together as a race

president bush is weighing conflicting advice 
on how to implement the new trade laws controversial mandate that 
the administration issue a hit list of nations that have erected 
the most harmful barriers against us products 
bush attended a session of the cabinetlevel economic policy 
council on monday to hear arguments from both sides but gave no 
indication which way he would decide according to one participant 
under the 1000page rewrite of the trade law passed by congress 
last year the administration must issue by may 28 a list of 
nations judged to have erected the most flagrant trade barriers 
against us products 
the administration then has 18 months to negotiate the removal 
of the barriers if unsuccessful it can retaliate by levying 
tariffs up to 100 percent against imports from an offending 
country effectively doubling the price of those goods 
an administration source who spoke on the condition that his 
name not be used said that bush would settle the matter before he 
left friday for a trip to the 40th anniversary meeting of the nato 
alliance 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp said after 
mondays meeting that bush had not made up his mind 
one option reportedly under consideration would be to narrowly 
target certain trade practices in japan india and brazil rather 
than pursue a longer list of trading abuses 
the specific practices reportedly under consideration include 
japans refusal to buy americanmade satellites and supercomputers 
and its restrictions on us lumber imports brazils 
importlicensing practices and indias restrictions on foreign 
investment and foreign insurance companies 
by targeting particular trading practices but not listing the 
offending countries by name the administration would blunt the 
sting of the hit list which has come under heavy attack by foreign 
governments 
the provision which reflects congressional frustration over the 
huge trade deficits america has run up in recent years has deeply 
split the administration 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher and us trade 
representative carla hills have said that failure to name several 
countries including japan to the hit list runs the risk of a 
protectionist backlash in congress 
but michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser and 
budget director richard darman have countered that targeting japan 
americas closest ally in the pacific would harm broader us 
interests 
boskin earlier this month warned that us efforts to retaliate 
against its trading partners could spark a trade war and lead to a 
worldwide recession 
hills recently told reporters that in the last month she has 
seen a parade of trade officials seek to make concessions in an 
effort to stay off the socalled super 301 list 
because of such concessions its considered likely that south 
korea taiwan and the european community will not be named to the 
list 
south korea has moved aggressively to reduce the number of 
outstanding trade disputes with the united states agreeing just 
last week to remove several barriers to american products 
on friday hills and frans andriessen her counterpart with the 
12nation european community announced that the two sides had 
agreed to follow procedures established by the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade in resolving us complaints about european 
subsidies for oilseed and a european complaint involving us sugar 
quotas 
the announcement was seen as an effort to ease trade tensions 
between the united states and the ec but andriessen also warned 
hills that the europeans would challenge the new trade law before 
gatt if washington put the community on the upcoming trade hit list 
that possibility could put the united states in the embarrassing 
position of having an international tribunal declare the key 
section of the new trade law in violation of global trading rules 
gatt a global trade charter signed by 96 nations serves as the 
international trade agency that tries to resolve trade disputes

scientists searching for new ways to battle 
cancer have for the first time injected genetically altered cells 
into a human 
the lead researcher in the federally approved experiment 
launched early monday at national institutes of health dr steven 
a rosenberg said a milkycolored fluid containing cells that were 
genetically manipulated using a mouse virus was intravenously 
administered to a cancer patient 
nih officials would identify the patient who underwent the 
30minute procedure only as a male suffering from malignant 
melanoma the extremely virulent disease also known as black mole 
cancer 
today was the first ever said rosenberg it is the first 
time that a new gene has been introduced into a human 
a federal court suit settled last tuesday cleared the way for 
the experiment the foundation on economic trends and its 
president jeremy rifkin had sued earlier this year to block the 
research claiming the experiments had been approved by the nih 
without proper public hearings 
a federal judge dismissed the suit after the nih located in 
suburban bethesda md agreed that a committee that evaluates 
human gene research will hold all its deliberations and votes in 
open public hearings 
rosenberg a national cancer institute researcher and his 
collaborators dr r michael blaese also of nci and dr w french 
anderson of the national heart lung and blood institute are using 
a mouse virus to study a cancertreating technique that uses white 
blood cells called tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes or tils 
the researchers earlier had removed til cells from a patients 
tumor and spurred them to multiply by bathing them in the growth 
factor interleukin2 or il2 the cells and the il2 were then 
injected back into the patient where scientists believe they 
attack the cancer directly and exclusively 
earlier research showed the technique suppressed tumor growth in 
12 of 20 patients tested rosenberg reported 
the researchers want to determine why the therapy worked in some 
patients but not in others to do this they mark the til cells 
with a bacterial gene that can be easily identified enabling the 
researchers to track their distribution and effectiveness 
the scientists mark the til cells by using a mouse leukemia 
retrovirus that could change the genetic pattern of the til cells 
a bacterial gene that is resistant to neomycin an antibiotic is 
introduced into the mouse virus the virus in turn is exposed to 
the til cells and transfers into those cells the bacterial gene 
the resulting soup a milkywhite fluid is then injected 
into the patient by tracking the distribution of the 
neomycinresistant gene the researchers can determine where the 
til cells go in the body and how long they live 
rosenberg said the mouse virus has been crippled so it cannot 
reproduce and the virus dies after completing the gene transfer 
three or four tests were to be run within 24 hours and many 
more over the course of several weeks on the patient who received 
the first genealtered cells rosenberg said 
a second patient will receive the cells later this week and in 
the incubator right now we have cells for another half dozen 
patients rosenberg said 
under the approved research plan up to 10 patients will receive 
geneticallyaltered cells 
rosenberg said the agreement specifies that all the patients 
must be terminally ill with malignant melanoma and expected to live 
only about 90 days the patients who will not be identified are 
all volunteers and have given written consent for the tests after 
being fully informed of the procedure the nih said 
rosenberg said the ultimate goal of the experiments is to 
develop geneticallyaltered cells that would be more effective in 
battling cancer the technique may eventually be applied to a 
variety of tumors he said 
were trying to develop more effective cancer treatment and 
this is just a tool to help us do that he said were working 
in the lab to develop other genes that will make the cells more 
effective as anticancer agents 
rosenberg said other researchers are closely following the 
experiments in hopes of finding ways that geneticallyaltered cells 
could be use to combat other diseases

the arab league convenes a summit 
meeting today marking the return of egypt to the councils of the 
arab world and for the first time in league history lebanons seat 
is vacant 
the reinstatement of egypt to league membership following a 
10year suspension was accepted reluctantly by libyas moammar 
gadhafi who held out to the last moment to try to prevent it 
an uneasy compromise on lebanon on the other hand resulted in 
the temporary suspension of lebanons league membership 
moroccos king hassan ii hugged president hosni mubarak of egypt 
upon mubaraks arrival in casablanca on monday and a 21gun salute 
boomed 
egypt had been excluded since 1979 for signing the camp david 
peace treaty with israel most arab nations warmly welcomed egypts 
return to the 22member league 
egypt has never ceased to serve the causes of our nation 
whether on the palestinian front or in connection with the bloody 
war which raged for eight long years between iran and iraq said 
arab league secretarygeneral chadli klibi 
it was only after days of frantic mediation efforts by syria 
algeria and tunisia that gadhafi agreed to attend the casablanca 
summit for a week prior to the meeting he maintained that it 
would be a waste of time because it could handle no urgent arab 
problems at the moment 
a lastmoment minisummit of four nations in tripoli and later 
in oran in western algeria apparently convinced gadhafi that it 
was better to attend reluctantly than be isolated in the arab world 
the libyan news agency jana announced his attendance without 
explanation jana quoted the leaders of the four countries libya 
algeria syria and tunisia as saying they agreed to confront 
any concessions at the summit to the enemies of the palestinian 
people 
the summit was called to offer support to the plo in its 
campaign for acceptance in the arabisraeli peace process and to 
discuss ways to stop lebanons civil war 
but delegates said privately that gadhafi was in fact correct 
no urgent need for an arab summit existed other than to arrange the 
ceremonial reentry of egypt into the arab family 
at a preparatory meeting foreign ministers failed to make 
progress on the palestinian problem and the division of lebanon 
under two rival administrations 
syria and the palestine liberation organization were at 
loggerheads over plo peace moves and iraq was outspoken in defense 
of lebanese christian leader gen michel aoun 
because of its inability to solve the lebanese crisis a 
ministerial preparatory committee came up with the unprecedented 
solution of leaving lebanons seat empty for now 
the committee felt that allowing both aoun and his moslem rival 
acting prime minister salim hoss to take the lebanese seat jointly 
would perpetuate the division of lebanon conference sources said 
it decided that neither would be admitted as a delegate but 
both would be present in casablanca the final decision on who

a grand jury has added three felony 
counts to the criminal charges facing the former skipper of the 
exxon valdez 
meanwhile a worker was killed monday aboard a ship housing 
workers involved in the cleanup of the massive oil spill caused by 
the wreck of the tanker 
in anchorage joseph hazelwood was charged with three counts of 
seconddegree criminal mischief district attorney dwayne mcconnell 
said 
the indictment accuses him of reckless actions before the 
987foot tanker ran aground on bligh reef if convicted of all 
three hazelwood could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison and 
fined 150000 mcconnell said 
hazelwood 42 of huntington ny was charged in valdez in 
late march with three misdemeanors operating a boat while 
intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent pollution 
mcconnell said the state will ask to have all the charges 
consolidated into a single trial hazelwood is free on 50000 bail 
on the misdemeanor charges pending a june 20 trial no date has 
been set for his arraignment on the felony charges in superior 
court 
hazelwoods blood alcohol content was illegally high nearly 11 
hours after the accident the coast guard said he had turned over 
control of the tanker to the third mate who was not certified to 
pilot the ship in prince william sound 
several crew members said at last weeks national transportation 
safety board hearings in anchorage that they drank with hazelwood 
before the ship left the valdez terminal for the transalaska 
pipeline others testified they smelled alcohol on his breath but 
said he didnt seem to be impaired 
on monday a food worker aboard one of the vessels housing 
cleanup workers in prince william sound was crushed by a freight 
elevator aboard the coastal star a headquarters ship anchored 
about 55 miles southwest of valdez coast guard chief mark kennedy 
said 
the victims identity was being withheld until relatives could 
be notified 
exxon has several thousand workers cleaning beaches in the sound 
and along the southern alaska coast most of them housed on ships 
like the coastal star exxon has leased more than 600 vessels for 
the cleanup 
meanwhile exxon and the us fish amp wildlife service announced 
a special rehabilitation center will be opened in anchorage for 
bald eagles and other flesheating birds as the toll of wildlife 
continues to mount 
at least 43 birds of prey are among the more than 17000 birds 
confirmed dead as the result of the march 24 spill of nearly 11 
million gallons of oil by the tanker 
exxon said it was giving an anchorage veterinarian 100000 for 
the bird facility the oil company said james scott will be 
assisted by pat redig director of the raptor center at the 
university of minnesota 
exxon said last week it already had spent nearly 100 million 
trying to clean up the oil that has stained alaskas southern 
coastline the state department of environmental conservation said 
it has inventoried more than 700 miles of contaminated beach 
the alyeska pipeline service co the company which operates the 
tanker terminal in valdez and is responsible for initial spill 
response said the first of four tanker escort vessels has arrived 
alyeska spokesman tom brennan said the liberty service and three 
other vessels on their way from seattle will carry containment 
booms and other equipment to deal with spills 
alyeska was criticized harshly after the exxon valdez spill 
because its response vessel didnt reach the scene until nearly 11 
hours after the tanker ran aground 
scientists plan to attack the spill by stimulating natural 
bacteria to break down poisonous components the first such 
largescale experimental attack the new york times reported in 
todays editions 
scientists plan to apply powdered fertilizer to about 1500 feet 
of beach on naked island to stimulate bacteria the times said 
quoting us environmental protection administration officials 
the experiment will not involve recombinant or selectively bred 
organisms and will rely wholly on common microbes alreadly present 
in alaskan waters the newspaper said

the government says it will halve the number of 
nepalese gurkhas serving in the british army before the 1997 
transfer of hong kong to china most of them serve as guards in the 
british colony 
the gurkhas have fought alongside british troops since 1815 
including during the two world wars and the 1982 falklands war with 
argentina said defense secretary george younger 
he announced in the house of commons on monday that a 
progressive restructuring of the gurkhas five infantry 
battalions will begin in 1992 reducing their number to 4000 
soldiers 
britain first encountered the gurkhas when they fought british 
attempts to establish trade routes from india to tibet armed with 
13inch kukri fighting knives their primary skill is jungle 
warfare but they have evolved into a key fast reaction force 
for the army 
they have proved a vital source of funds for nepal one of the

prime minister yitzhak shamir today rejected 
criticism leveled by secretary of state james a baker iii of 
israels policy of continuing to support new jewish settlements in 
the occupied lands 
now is the time to lay aside once and for all the 
unrealistic vision of a greater israel baker said in a speech in 
washington on monday 
shamir interviewed by israel radio said i dont know how 
anyone could speak at all of a large israel israel is a very small 
country and all of us know that its territory is very limited it 
really rings ironic to speak of israel as big 
foreign minister moshe arens also dismissed bakers call on 
israel to halt jewish settlement in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip and give up aspirations of annexing the territories 
these are our dreams we are speaking about our country and we 
have proven that we fulfill our dreams arens said on the radio 
interviewed from brussels 
shamir who was on a visit to london said of his disagreement 
with baker over jewish settlements in the territories it is 
clear there are differences of opinion between us and that isnt 
new i dont see any link between settlements and the subject of 
the peace process 
he added that he had explained his views on the settlements 
fully and explicitly when he visited washington last month 
israel has built more than 130 settlements in the occupied 
territories since capturing them in the 1967 middle east war 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc considers these lands to be integral 
parts of historic israel 
about 70000 jews live in the settlements which are scattered 
among arab towns villages and refugee camps whose population 
totals 17 million 
the united states has long criticized jewish settlement building 
in these territories as an obstacle to peace but bakers comments 
in a speech to an american jewish lobby group on monday were seen 
as one of the sharpest american statements on the issue 
baker urged israel to foreswear annexation stop settlement 
activity allow schools to reopen referring to palestinian 
schools shut by israel in the west bank and gaza as part of a 
crackdown on a 17monthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
rule 
israeli newspapers headlined bakers criticism of israel giving 
little attention to his calls to palestinians to be more 
conciliatory toward israel and to abandon the illusion of control 
over all of palestine 
the haaretz daily quoted unnamed diplomats in washington as 
saying they found bakers speech to be very disappointing from 
israels standpoint the newspaper also said the speech was one 
of the worst for israel made by an american leader in the last 
decade

the reactivation of egypts membership in 
the arab league seals president hosni mubaraks success in 
returning to the fold without significant concessions 
few egyptians however expect it to signal a return to the 
heady days of the 1960s when the magnetism of gamal abdel nasser 
put egypt alone in the forefront of the arab world 
magazine editor makram mohammed ahmed a mubarak confidant 
said mubaraks egypt has managed with patience and perseverance 
and consideration for arab interests to return to the arab fabric 
i dont think that mubaraks egypt wants a repeat of the role 
egypt played in the 1960s the direction has changed 
all arab league members except libya approved of inviting egypt 
to the emergency summit today and wednesday in casablanca morocco 
even the libyans did not directly attack cairos invitation but 
professed to see no need for a summit syria previously almost as 
virulently antiegypt as libya welcomed the move 
the summit was called to offer support to the palestine 
liberation organization in its campaign for acceptance in the 
arabisraeli peace process and to discuss ways to stop lebanons 
civil war 
the arab league suspended egypt in 1979 to retaliate for the 
peace treaty president anwar sadat signed that year with israel 
all arab states except sudan somalia and oman broke diplomatic 
ties 
almost nine years later in november 1987 with iraq under 
pressure from iran in their long war the league allowed its 
members to resume ties with egypt all did except libya syria and 
syrias client lebanon 
despite the realization at that summit that egypts strong 
military was vital to counter threats from nonarab iran the 
league gave in to syrian objections and did not reinstate cairo 
its membership in the league reactivated egypt will achieve an 
important victory ending 10 years ostracism without touching 
what still is the arab worlds only peace treaty with israel 
until 1987 scrapping the treaty was an arab condition for 
restoring normalcy with the country that traditionally has served 
as a political and military anchor for the arabs 
despite syrias apparent decision to ignore that condition it 
professes to expect egypt to join arab ranks against israel an 
official statement said damascus approves the return of egypt to 
its natural place in the arab struggle adding that syrias 
president hafez assad is aware that president mubarak is not 
anwar sadat 
if mubarak is not sadat neither is he nasser egypts 
charismatic president who called the first arab league summit in 
cairo in january 1964 and inspired among arab leaders a strong 
sense of unity and identity 
in the late 1950s nasser merged egypt with syria and for a 
while north yemen in a strongly antiwestern promoscow union 
that dissolved in 1961 he sided with a new republican regime in 
iraq in 1961 and four years later sent 50000 troops to help yemeni 
rebels overthrow their king 
that move cost egypt millions of dollars and the support of 
saudi arabia allied to yemens royal family military experts said 
it also so weakened egypts military that israel scored a stunning 
victory in the 1967 middle east war 
shunning such impulsive acts mubarak used careful calculated 
decisionmaking to shepherd egypt back into the arab fold 
mubarak has said repeatedly that the arabs have learned to look 
for mutual interest and economic welfare rather than emotional 
rhetoric to deal with their friends he said that is the attitude 
that led to formation of a fournation arab cooperation council 
with jordan iraq and yemen this year 
union cannot be achieved in an emotional venture by a 
charismatic leader or by a pioneering state but by organized 
work over a long time based on the reality of differences and of 
economic interests ahmed wrote in his column in last thursdays 
edition of his magazine almussawar 
the power balance has changed egypt is not the greatest and 
richest anymore egypt cannot assume the role or the responsibility 
for the arab community as in the 60s because this has 
exhausted it and created many problems 
such talk would have been anathema to nasser and is anathema to 
libyas moammar gadhafi a devout follower of nassers ideas of one 
borderless arab nation from the euphrates to the atlantic 
since he took power in a 1969 coup that ended libyas monarchy 
gadhafi has been trying to merge his country with others in the 
arab world the genesis of his quarrel with egypt was sadats 
rejection of a unity move in 1972 
after egypt disclosed that mubarak would attend the casablanca 
summit libyan media announced a flurry of contacts between tripoli 
and the other arab governments evidently designed to head off the 
invitation or failing that the summit itself 
no indication emerged that the others paid any attention

an environmental group says the environmental 
protection agency routinely understates the severity of the smog 
problem in urban areas because it relies on too few monitoring 
devices 
the natural resources defense council said monday that in many 
large american cities unhealthy levels of smog are twice as 
frequent during the hot summer months as epa estimates would 
indicate 
last march the epa released 1988 air pollution figures that 
showed ozone pollution which is a chief component of urban smog 
as being the worst in a decade and clearly the most pervasive air 
pollution problem the country faces 
the agency indicated nearly 100 areas of the country have 
unhealthy levels of ozone pollution during at least some periods of 
the summer 
nevertheless according to the environmental group those epa 
statistics reflect only a fraction of the ozone pollution problem 
the environmental group said the epa estimates of days in which 
there are unhealthy levels of smog in an area are often based on 
smog readings from a single monitor 
this approach seriously underestimates the extent of the smog 
problem in most large urban areas said david hawkins an 
attorney for the environmental group and a former assistant 
administrator at the epa

one of the nations most profitable savings 
and loans has lost a bid to switch its insurance coverage from the 
fund that backs thrifts to the more healthy one that insures bank 
deposits 
the application by great western bank of beverly hills calif 
was denied monday by the federal home loan bank board which 
rejected the institutions claim that it was exempt from a 
temporary ban on defections from the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp 
great western the nations secondlargest fslicinsured 
institution had filed an application claiming it was eligible to 
convert from coverage by fslic to insurance with the federal 
deposit insurance corp 
the application was seen as a test case on whether regulators 
would allow widescale defections from the fslic although several 
smaller sampls already have been allowed to leave the thrifts 
insurance fund 
the fdic is considered the more attractive insurance fund 
because it retains big assets while the fslic has been largely 
depleted by the losses and failures plaguing the thrift industry 
legislation enacted in 1987 prohibited thrifts from leaving 
fslic until aug 10 1988 and congress has since extended the 
moratorium until aug 10 1989

people whose criticism of officials or government 
agencies amounts to the unpleasant truth cannot be jailed for 
speaking out the supreme court has ruled in limiting the scope of 
a widely assailed new decree 
the decree enacted april 8 bans discrediting officials and 
government bodie reformers and human rights activists have 
condemned it as being open to abuse 
wellfounded argumentative criticism of the action and 
decisions of these organs and officials by citizens acting 
publicly in the framework of socialist law cannot be viewed as a 
criminally punishable act the court said on monday 
president mikhail s gorbachev is seeking to strengthen the role 
of law in soviet society and mondays ruling constitutes one of 
the rare times the court has acted to ensure a controversial law is 
applied consistently 
the official tass news agency said that since the leadership of 
the supreme soviet or parliament passed the decree citizens have 
been arrested under differing interpretations of the law 
the supreme court told lower courts the decree touches only 
intentional public distribution of slanderous inventions that 
undermines faith in officials 
it said the decree does not apply to dispatches in the press 
and any other form of information reflecting insufficiencies in the 
activity of these organs social organizations and officials 
the ruling represents an effort to protect officials from 
insults and slander and protect the rights of individuals to 
express their views the court said 
tass did not say how many criminal cases have been filed on the 
basis of the new law or give any details of cases 
critics of the law include human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov and alvydas juozaidis a spokesman for lithuanias 
grassroots sajudis group who have called the decree pure 
stalinism 
some opponents have called on the congress of peoples deputies 
the countrys new legislative body that meets for the first time on 
thursday to overturn the law 
soviet officials have said the decree is more specific and less 
subject to abuse than articles 70 and 190 of the criminal code 
which for years have banned antisoviet agitation and 
propaganda and antisoviet slander 
dissidents were imprisoned under those laws for years last 
year however the soviet union said it intended to overhaul the 
laws and hundreds of people arrested under them have been released 
but reformers and dissidents reacted angrily to the new decree 
claiming its provision against discrediting officials was worse 
than the previous laws 
the decree also bans public calls to overthrow the government 
and premeditated acts aimed at inciting national or racial 
animosity 
also monday the supreme court continued its rehabilitation of 
soviets who were convicted of antisoviet activity from the 1930s 
through the 1960s 
the actions are seen as an effort to right the legal abuses of 
the past 
those rehabiliated monday included former middlelevel officials 
who were accused under josef stalin of being german spies or taking 
part in a conspiracy to kill the popular leningrad party chief 
sergei kirov in 1934 
a latvian poet ke skueniek who was convicted in 1962 of 
antisoviet agitation also was cleared

the bush administration is gradually 
prescribing a middle east settlement that excludes israeli control 
over the occupied west bank and gaza telling israel to forswear 
annexation 
in a speech monday secretary of state james a baker iii also 
demanded an end to further settlement of jews on the land taken by 
israel in the sixday war of 1967 
the speech followed statements by president bush last month 
ruling out israeli sovereignty over the territories 
baker mixed in demands that the arabs accept israel end their 
economic boycott of the jewish state and repudiate the 1975 un 
general assembly resolution equating zionism with racism 
baker called for full recognition of israel as a neighbor and 
partner in trade and human contact 
he also advised the palestinians to abandon the illusion of 
controlling all of palestine bakers reference was to israeli 
territory apart from the west bank and gaza 
the west bank and gaza which jordan and egypt lost to israel in 
the sixday war are predominantly arab but since israel took 
control jews have been establishing settlements there 
baker urged israel to stop settlement activity which 
apparently would rule out expanding current jewish settlements as 
well as starting new ones and his demand to forswear 
annexation would rule out incorporating any of the territory into 
israel 
the united states does not support annexation or permanent 
israeli control of the west bank and gaza nor do we support the 
creation of an independent palestinian state baker said 
the speech was delivered to the american israel public affairs 
committee a private research and lobbying group just before baker 
met at the state department with israeli defense minister yitzhak 
rabin 
rabin said his meeting with baker concentrated on trying to 
implement prime minister yitzhak shamirs proposal for elections to 
select palestinian leaders to negotiate selfrule on the west bank 
and in gaza 
today shamir rejected bakers criticism of israels policy of 
continuing to support new jewish settlements in the occupied lands 
including bakers statement that now is the time to lay aside 
once and for all the unrealistic vision of a greater israel 
shamir interviewed by israel radio said i dont know how 
anyone could speak at all of a large israel israel is a very small 
country and all of us know that its territory is very limited it 
really rings ironic to speak of israel as big 
shamir who was on a visit to london said it is clear there 
are differences of opinion between us and that isnt new i dont 
see any link between settlements and the subject of the peace 
process 
rabin said he had not read bakers speech but later he told 
israeli reporters he wished baker had directed more of the speech 
to the palestinians 
today rabin meets with members of congress and attends a dinner 
at blair house hosted by defense secretary dick cheney he sees 
bush on wednesday 
bakers approach to the arabisraeli conflict is different from 
past us administrations in that he has not put forward a us 
plan for negotiations or settlement 
instead baker has given lukewarm support to shamirs proposal 
for elections to be followed by negotiations on an overall 
settlement 
neither the united states nor any other party inside or 
outside can or will dictate an outcome he said 
however baker added we do have an idea about the reasonable 
middle ground to which a settlement should be directed and he 
went on to state the administrations position on several 
controversial issues 
now is the time to lay aside once and for all the 
unrealistic vision of a greater israel he said 
baker also called for the reopening of schools in the occupied 
territories shamir said later that schools were open in gaza 
an american jewish leader seymour d reich said that in his 
judgment israel would have few problems taking bakers advice 
annexation of the territories is nowhere in israels present 
plans so far as i understand said reich chairman of the 
conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations 
and reich said in a statement israel would be more than 
eager and follow mr bakers suggestion to open the schools 
provided they are used as educational institutions and not as a 
staging area for the intefadeh uprising 
at the same time reich said baker deserved praise for calling 
on the palestinians to abandon violence and to reach out to israel

libyas leader col moammar gadhafi said in an 
interview on french television that a palestinian state and an 
israeli state could never coexist in the middle east 
we recognize only one palestinian state on palestinian land 
gadhafi told the interviewer for frances tf1 network on monday 
one palestinian state in palestine the palestinians whether 
they are arabs or jews constitute a palestinian state 
asked if coexistence was impossible he responded 
impossible and even the israelis know that it is impossible 
plo chairman yasser arafat has opted for a twostate solution in 
the middle east and staked out the west bank of the jordan river 
and the gaza strip for the palestinians 
at the last session of the palestine national council the plos 
legislative branch the organization recognized israel and 
renounced terrorism that position was stated more firmly by arafat 
later 
israel continues to refuse to talk to the plo which it 
considers a terrorist organization 
during a visit to paris arafat tried to remove another obstacle 
to talking with israel by declaring the plo charter which calls 
for eliminating israel outdated 
gadhafi was asked about arafats statement on the charter 
it is simply a way to expose the israelis because the 
israelis will never accord the palestinian people their rights 
even if they the israelis get all of the concessions possible 
and arafat only wanted to unmask the israelis in the eyes of the 
world 
when the arabs were in andalusia spain nearly 800 years ago 
we accepted no concessions and we didnt leave andalusia until 
defeated its the same thing 
asked if he still was trying to undermine the west gadhafi 
said only undermine imperialism and colonialism and struggle 
against expansionism 
the libyan leader said he condemned terrorism but do not mix 
up terrorism and the sacred struggle for liberty

a record 843 million japanese traveled abroad last 
year up 23 percent from 1987 the government said in a report 
released today 
the prime ministers office also said a record 236 million 
foreigners visited japan surpassing the previous record 233 
million posted in 1985 
the rise in the number of japanese travelers was attributed to 
the continuing trend of making overseas trips thanks to the 
yens appreciation against the dollar said noboru kawana of the 
prime ministers office 
the yens appreciation since late 1985 has given the japanese 
more spending power abroad 
hawaii remained the most popular destination for japanese 
travelers with 117 million visiting there hong kong was next 
with 124 million japanese visitors followed by south korea with 
111 million and taiwan with 920000

the dollar ended sharply higher against the 
japanese yen tuesday while share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange fell 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which gained 
6590 points monday shed 25125 points or 074 percent to end 
trading at 3381661 
the dollar closed at 14195 yen up 150 yen from the previous 
days 14045yen finish the currency started higher at 14205 yen 
and moved between 14182 yen and 14303 yen 
the dollar which opened sharply higher in tokyo following a 
similar upswing on overseas markets was still bullish despite the 
bank of japans dollarselling intervention traders said 
even though a discountrate hike is expected it might not be 
enough to make the yen attractive unless the hike is far more than 
05 percent said an analyst with a commercial bank in tokyo 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the central bank is expected to raise the official discount rate 
by at least 05 percent from the current 25 percent but the bank 
has made no official announcement 
meanwhile japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama said early 
tuesday that a decision on the discount rate could be based on 
upcoming endofthe month price data 
he said however the dollars current strength still does not 
warrant a statement by groupofseven nations at this time 
its not that kind of movement he said 
he also said that currency rates are only one factor in 
formulating japans monetary policy indirectly denying speculation 
that the bank of japan would raise its discount rate solely on 
foreign exchange considerations 
citing the white houses statement that the dollars rise 
against the yen is a matter of concern to the us murayama 
said the bush administration is opposed to the stronger dollar but 
noted that market movements are difficult to control 
on the stock exchange dealers said the plunge was largely due 
to the yens sharp drop against the dollar 
kenji ishizuka a dealer with daiwa securities said share 
prices which were lower across the board fell further following a 
news report that the bank of japan and the finance ministry reached 
an agreement to raise the official discount rate soon 
its been quite difficult for investors to determine the 
direction of trading because of uncertainties over the exchange 
rates he said 
the majority of market players remained cautious trying to 
watch the currency market movements ishizuka added 
higher interest rates usually discourage stock investment

gay rights advocates hailed a unanimous 
vote by the citys board of supervisors to adopt a domestic 
partnership law recognizing the unions of homosexuals and unmarried 
heterosexual couples 
the supervisors voted 100 with one member absent monday to 
approve an ordinance allowing unmarried couples homosexual or 
heterosexual to register with the city as domestic partners they 
also urged the mayor to consider extending health benefits to 
livein lovers of city employees 
the legislation a first for a major us city faces a second 
procedural vote next week before going to mayor art agnos who has 
said he will sign it 
homosexual rights groups gave cautious praise to the legislation 
its an important first step said roberta achtenberg 
executive director of the national center for lesbian rights 
there is no one piece of legislation that couldve gone far 
enough 
the precise benefits of the legislation remain unclear because 
no one knows if health care benefits will ultimately become 
available to domestic partners of city employees she said still 
she predicted that many homosexual and unmarried heterosexual 
couples will register 
the roman catholic church helped defeat a similar proposal in 
1982 but after mondays vote deacon norman phillips of the san 
francisco archdiocese expressed resignation 
we could always hope that it wasnt going to happen but i 
think sensibly it looked like it was going to phillips said 
i think our hope would be that they might reconsider 
the church is opposed to the pseudomarriage provision of 
the legislation although it supports the extension of civil rights 
benefits and health coverage phillips said 
but some advocates complained that while the burdens of domestic 
partnership are substantial under the ordinance including 
becoming responsible for each others basic living expenses the 
benefits remain somewhat unclear 
board of supervisors president harry britt author of the 
measure and a leader of the citys politically powerful gay 
community acknowledged the doubts but was confident nevertheless 
there are still obstacles ahead of us in terms of working out 
the health insurance part of this said britt were sure we 
can do it and that we can do it without any negative effects on 
anybody its not going to cost the taxpayers any money 
some city employees worry that health care premiums could rise 
if the cost of insuring domestic partners including aids 
patients in the city with the highest per capita number of such 
patients in the nation drains city funds health and insurance 
officials however claim the newly eligible people will have a 
negligible effect on the city because employees dependents must 
pay monthly premiums of about 150 
despite the criticisms britt spoke passionately of the 
fundamental right of people to pursue love on their own terms 
if my heart tells me and your heart tells you that we should 
share our lives together and take care of one another the 
government has no business telling us that were going to be 
discriminated against he said 
i hope that other cities around the country will be 
looking at ways to change their laws to reflect the reality of the 
way people live britt said 
a few other cities including berkeley across the san francisco 
bay have adopted policies extending health benefits to livein 
lovers and 219 couples in west hollywood have registered since 
1985 for a domestic partnership certificate 
san francisco would be the first major metropolitan city to 
allow nonmarried couples to register their relationships as 
traditional couples file marriage licenses 
the law defines domestic partners as any two people who have 
chosen to share one anothers lives in an intimate and committed 
relationship the declaration of domestic partnership form 
would be filed with the county clerk for a 35 fee 
under the partnership law 25000 city workers would be entitled 
to the same bereavement leave that is accorded married couples and 
hospital visitation rights would extend to livein lovers

the training manuals for city police officers 
i dont think the academy prepared us for this said carl 
rust after he and his partner helped round up about 30 cows 
rust and his partner dave bardascini were not the only ones 
surprised to see the cows saturday morning wandering the streets 
of this city of 21000 people located 40 miles west of albany 
at first i saw a couple of cows and i thought i was seeing 
something said nora dicaprio whose yard became an impromptu cow 
pasture 
the cows owned by joseph f korona of nearby fort johnson 
knocked down a pasture fence after being frightened by three dogs 
and headed for the city according to koronas son joseph j 
korona 
rust said he and bardascini were dispatched to a city 
neighborhood after police received a report of large animals 
walking on the road 
we got the call and the dispatcher told us it was one cow 
and we turned the corner and it was about 20 to 22 cows rust 
said 
rust said the cows began running through backyards and then 
split into two groups with about 13 of them heading for the 
amsterdam municipal golf course

three latin american foreign ministers 
fulfilling a mandate from the organization of american states 
headed to panama today to promote a democratic transfer of power 
panamanian authorities have promised to cooperate with the 
mediators but bush administration officials said initial comments 
by panamanian authorities have not been encouraging 
a progovernment party in panama said monday it wants the oas to 
focus on us aggression against panama 
the foreign minister of trinidad and tobago sahadeo basdeo 
arrived monday night and said the delegation is not here to 
interfere with the internal affairs of panama we came as friends 
and neighbors 
the other two from ecuador and guatemala were to fly 
separately to panama and planned to join oas secretary general joao 
baena soares of brazil 
oas foreign ministers last week blamed gen manuel antonio 
noriega for the grave events and abuses in panama following the 
failed election process in that country earlier this month 
after a vote count that international observers said was marred 
by massive fraud panamas electoral tribunal threw out the 
results the bush administration has maintained that the opposition 
slate based on an independent count won the election by a 31 
margin 
opposition candidates subsequently were beaten and bloodied by 
noriega supporters during a postelection demonstration 
the united states claims that noriega has disrupted 
constitutional processes on two occasions in 15 months the first 
was the ouster of thenpresident eric arturo delvalle in february 
1988 and the second was what the administration says was the theft 
and subsequent annulment of the may 7 election 
in addition to baena soares the delegation is made up of the 
foreign minister of ecuador diego cordovez of trinidad sahadeo 
basdeo and of guatemala mario palencia 
the oas resolution calls for the mediators to secure a 
national accord within democratic mechanisms and in the shortest 
time possible to ensure the transfer of power with full respect 
for the sovereign will of the panamanian people 
the tentative plan is for the ministers to report back to their 
oas colleagues on june 6 if panamanian authorities show no 
interest in complying with the spirit of the oas resolution the 
bush administration is expected to support an escalation of oas 
pressure against noriega 
a us official insisting on anonymity said monday that 
noriega has raised the possibility of resolving the crisis by 
inviting opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara to join 
a threemember junta the other members would be noriega allies 
noriega is proposing one of you and two of us said the 
official suggesting that any such proposal would not be acceptable 
to oas ministers 
the oppositions three top candidates seeking recognition of 
their victory claim in the election shook hands and passed out 
leaflets in panama monday welcoming the oas delegation 
the oas will not solve all our problems but it will create 
the environment they have come to investigate said endara 
a progovernment party monday criticized the oas for condemning 
noriega and said its delegation could not mediate among panamanians 
we call on the oas to adopt a virile attitude toward 
aggression against our people by the united states said a 
statement issued by the revolutionary democratic party the largest 
progovernment group 
noriega and his allies have consistently maintained that 
panamas problems stem from a systematic us effort to subvert the 
countrys democratic process citing accounts of a 10 million cia 
contribution to the opposition coalition

women who took birth control pills while 
teenagers in the 1960s face about five times the usual risk of 
breast cancer before they reach menopause a study concludes 
the research conducted in sweden is one of several recent 
studies to raise concerns that the pill may increase the odds of 
breast cancer 
while describing their findings as alarming the researchers 
cautioned that birth control pills have changed substantially since 
their introduction and newer pills may not heighten the risk of 
breast cancer 
the research directed by dr hakan olsson and colleagues from 
university hospital in lund was presented monday at the annual 
meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
at the meeting an italian specialist described a new approach 
to treating breast cancer that he said could virtually eliminate 
the need for mastectomies which have been the standard approach to 
the disease for nearly a century 
breast cancer is the leading cancer killer among american women 
and strikes one in 10 
olssons study was conducted in southern sweden where the pill 
was widely used by teenage girls after its introduction in the 
1960s 
he said that the incidence of breast cancer among women under 
age 40 has risen in sweden since the advent of the pil and while 
his study cannot conclusively blame the pill we have no other 
explanation for the increase of breast cancer in young women 
however even if pill use during the 1960s has increased the 
chances of breast cancer the risk is still relatively small among 
women before they reach menopause olsson said that the overall 
chance of breast cancer before menopause is about 1 percent while 
the risk among early pill users is about 5 percent 
the increased risk appears to be limited to those who began 
taking the pill while young the research found no increased breast 
cancer among women who started on the pill after age 25 or after 
their first fullterm pregnancy 
olsson said 10 studies since 1983 have reported links between 
the pill and breast cancer 
dr jules harris director of the cancer center at chicagos 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center said the swedish study 
strongly suggests that birth control pills are linked to early 
premenopausal breast cancer 
despite the mounting research evidence however some experts 
have been skeptical in january a panel convened by the us food 
and drug administration concluded that the reported links between 
the pill and breast cancer were still inconclusive 
doctors also point out that the pills potential dangers must be 
balanced against its benefits for instance the pill appears to 
substantially reduce the risk of cancer of the uterus and ovaries 
olssons study was based on a comparison of 174 breast cancer 
patients with 454 healthy women besides showing that teenage pill 
users were five times more likely to get breast cancer the study 
found that their tumors were larger and their outlook worse than in 
those who had not used the pill so early in life 
in a report on changes in treating breast cancer dr gianni 
bonadonna of the national cancer institute in italy described his 
initial results in 97 patients with a new approach to avoiding 
mastectomy 
although doctors are increasingly removing just the cancerous 
lump when the tumor is small total removal of the breast remains 
the standard therapy for larger tumors 
bonadonna and colleagues are experimenting with giving 
chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the lumps then surgeons are 
able to take out just the tumor and leave the rest of the breast 
this approach worked in 87 percent of women with large tumors 
who otherwise would have needed mastectomies 
bonadonna acknowledged that his approach is likely to be 
controversial and more followup will be needed many doctors 
believe that mastectomy still gives women the best chance of 
avoiding recurring cancer later in life even if their tumors are 
relatively small

spanish police have flatly contradicted crucial 
parts of the british governments justification for the slaying of 
three unarmed ira guerrillas in gibraltar last year a london 
newspaper reported today 
british authorities have always maintained that special air 
service commandos shot to death mairead farrell sean savage and 
daniel mccann in the british colony on march 6 1988 because they 
feared the guerrillas were about to detonate a car bomb 
but the independent said in todays editions that five senior 
spanish police officers involved in the case have told the paper 
that 
british security forces were told the guerrillas car was in 
place in gibraltar the day before the shootings giving them at 
least 15 hours to verify spanish advice that it contained no bomb 
the three guerrillas were not discovered by chance in 
gibraltar the day they were shot hours before they were killed 
they had been tracked by spanish authorities to the border which 
they crossed on foot the surveillance operation was then passed on 
to the british 
the paper did not name the spanish police officers but reported 
these claims undermine the british authorities explanation 
the british security forces claimed to have been taken by 
surprise by the sudden arrival of the trio and the car and blamed 
the spanish police for sloppy surveillance work which allowed the 
ira members to slip undetected onto the rock of gibraltar 
it quoted one senior spanish police officer as saying we told 
the british we were 90 percent certain that the car contained no 
bomb 
the paper commented in a separate editorial the information 
published today makes it appear more likely that the three 
terrorists were in effect executed 
a spokesman at the ministry of defense in london refused to 
comment on the report an inquest was held into these events and 
that inquest came to its conclusions there is nothing further we 
would add he said the spokesman in accordance with british 
practice declined to be named 
the jury at a monthlong inquest in gibraltar that ended last 
sept 30 ruled in a 92 vote that the three were lawfully killed 
british authorities have said the guerrillas were preparing to 
explode a car bomb during a parade by british soldiers no bomb was 
found in gibraltar but two days after the shootings spanish police 
found a car packed with explosives in marbella that had been rented 
by one of the three 
the ira said the three were on active service a euphemism for 
a bombing or shooting mission when they were shot 
the shootings raised a storm of protest among ira supporters in 
northern ireland and abroad drew criticism from prime minister 
charles haugheys government in the republic of ireland and 
triggered a wave of violence in northern ireland in which nine 
people including two british soldiers died 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting british rule there it 
wants to unite the predominantly protestant province with the 95 
percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule 
the human rights group amnesty international said last month 
that the inquest jury acted on incomplete evidence and conflicting 
testimony 
amnesty renewed its demand for a judicial inquiry and said the 
inquest failed to allay suspicions of an official policy of 
deliberate planned killings 
the independent said ministers in prime minister margaret 
thatchers government remained adamant that the british version of 
events given at the inquest was correct 
the paper said some ministers dismissed the reported assertions 
by spanish police as part of a power struggle in spains socialist 
government 
it said both spain and britain were concerned that the 
continuing dispute about the shootings could harm relations

the racketeering convictions of two 
powerful north slope officials should put an end to the days of 
feasting on oilbloated public works projects in the state a 
federal prosecutor says 
a federal court on monday convicted lobbyist lewis dischner and 
consultant carl mathisen in alaskas longest criminal trial 
the advisers to former borough mayor eugene brower used their 
positions to pocket millions in kickbacks and steer construction 
contracts to companies they secretly owned the trial showed 
prosecutors said payments to dischner and mathisen added 73 
million to the cost of the massive contruction program in the early 
1980s aimed at providing 20th century comforts for the nations 
northernmost communities 
the north slope borough is the eskimoled government of the vast 
northern region of alaska 
dischner 71 was convicted on 21 charges ranging from 
racketeering to extortion to wire and mail fraud mathisen 56 was 
convicted on 22 similar charges the jury acquitted dischner on 
four income tax counts 
were obviously pleased said us attorney michael spaan 
we hope that it will change the way that business is done in 
alaska 
the complex trial lasted more than seven months the verdict 
came in the fourth week of deliberations by an 11member jury one 
juror was dismissed after being hurt in a horsebackriding accident 
prosecutors said dischner and mathisen socked away 21 million 
during browers administration from 1981 to 1984 3 million in 
salaries 9 million from contracts and 9 million from a 10 
percent fee assessed all companies doing business with the borough 
the government claimed dischner and mathisen manipulated brower 
an inexperienced leader whom they had helped elect brower 
testified for the government as part of pleabargain that included 
a 30day sentence and a 5000 fine for tax evasion 
defense lawyers attributed the inflated cost of the boroughs 
capital construction to harsh arctic conditions a rush to finish 
the work and the brower administrations desire to create jobs 
federal racketeering statutes under which dischner and mathisen 
were prosecuted allow the government to seek forfeiture of money 
and property obtained illegally 
lawyers for the pair said they will appeal 
sentencing was scheduled for august or september dischner and 
mathisen will remain free on personal recognizance until then said 
us district judge h russel holland

former hud secretary samuel r pierce personally 
decided which projects were subsidized under a program being 
investigated as an improper source of republican political funds a 
former hud official said 
the official thomas t demery accused pierce of improperly 
promoting certain housing projects over others so that they would 
receive millions of dollars in subsidies the new york times 
reported in todays editions 
pierce headed the department of housing and urban development 
throughout the reagan administration 
the program under fire provided an incentive for developers to 
renovate housing by subsidizing rents for 15 years an hud audit 
found widespread abuses in the program including an absence of 
competitive bidding 
demery told the times that pierce ordered allocations for some 
projects as a result of requests from members of congress and other 
politicians 
the hud audit found that housing developers involved in the 
subsidy program paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to prominent 
republican consultants who often had little or no experience in 
housing 
the audits suggested that the consultants were paid to make 
contact with pierce 
the audit criticized demerys role in the project but demery 
blamed pierce for ordering him to give the subsidies to certain 
programs 
the newspaper said pierce did not return telephone calls pierce 
is to testify before a house panel on thursday

the dollar continued to rise sharply against the 
japanese yen today pushing down share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange dealers said 
the 225issue nikkei stock average a 6590point gainer monday 
shed 25125 points or 074 percent closing at 3381661 
the dollar closed at 14195 yen up 150 yen from mondays 
14045yen finish the dollar has climbed 751 yen since may 11 
and its closing today was the highest since 14200 yen on oct 27 
1987 
it opened at 14205 yen and ranged between 14182 yen and 14303 
yen in wide fluctuations that mitsuhiko kinugasa a dealer with 
daiwa bank likened to a jet coaster 
traders said the bank of japan intervened in the market in 
efforts to check the dollars rise 
but continuing rumors that the central bank would soon raise its 
discount rate as well as feelings that the dollar would have 
trouble staying above 143 yen also helped bring the us currency 
down from todays highs they said 
the dollars slip later in the afternoon was not because of 
the bank of japans dollarselling effort but because of news that 
the bank and the finance ministry agreed to raise the official 
discount rate soon kinugasa said 
market players and analysts expect the central bank to raise the 
key rate at least by 05 percentage point from the current 25 
percent the rate affects interest charges by commercial banks and 
higher interest rates tend to make the yen more attractive to 
investors 
when the authorities announce the decision it could encourage 
yen buying for a little while but it will fade away by the time 
the discount rate actually goes up kinugasa said 
another trader with a japanese commercial bank in tokyo 
speaking on condition of anonymity said a discount rate increase 
might not be enough to make the yen attractive unless the hike 
is far more than 05 percent 
japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama meanwhile told kyodo 
news service he had no knowledge of any decision to raise the rate 
he said earlier today that a decision could be based on price 
data compiled at the end of may 
noting a white house statement that the administration of 
president bush opposes a stronger dollar murayama said market 
movements are difficult to control 
bank of japan gov satoshi sumita said the central bank would 
take appropriate measures when necessary to curb inflation 
on the stock exchange dealers said todays plunge was mainly 
due to the yens weakness against the dollar 
the nikkei was losing some 500 points at the beginning of the 
afternoon session but started to recover as shortterm interest 
rates stopped rising said an analyst with nomura securities 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
higher interest rates discourage stock buying 
japanese investors are now watching moves on the foreign 
exchange market as well as the timing of any official discount 
rate hike the analyst said 
but the discount rate hike might not be as discouraging as it 
could be because its been speculated for quite some time so the 
majority of market players have been well prepared for the hike 
he said 
daiwa securities dealer kenji ishizuka said its been quite 
difficult for investors to determine the direction of trading 
because of uncertainties over the exchange rates which have become 
very speculative 
the majority of market players remained on the sidelines 
watching currency market movements he said 
trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 700 
million shares up from mondays 550 million

chinas rebelling students at first asked only to 
talk to the government as equals now they want the government to 
fall 
the turning point in chinas student movement came saturday 
when premier li peng charging that the students were being used by 
malcontents determined to overthrow the communist system imposed 
martial law on most of beijing 
during the first month of the students drive for democratic 
reform their demands were modest they wanted senior leaders to 
meet them as equals in a nationally telecast dialogue on how to 
make china a freer and less corrupt society 
the dialogue must also mean recognition of their newly formed 
independent student unions the activists said 
in a more general sense the students sought freedom of the 
press greater funding for education public disclosures of the 
incomes of high officials and a more sincere attempt to wipe out 
the corruption that is endemic to the communist party and chinas 
bureaucracy 
there were no deadlines or threats although some students put 
up posters condemning the communist system or calling for 
multiparty elections the majority stressed that they were willing 
to work within the system 
they said the marches sitins class boycotts and hunger 
strikes would end if the government merely talked to them 
instead the government declared martial law and ordered troops 
to sweep the students from tiananmen square 
that move has radicalized the student demands li who a week 
earlier visited hunger strikers in their hospitals has taken on

the famed portrait of mao tsetung in tiananmen 
square was splattered with paint today as hundreds of thousands of 
students intellectuals and workers marched near the painting 
demanding premier li peng step down 
despite exhaustion and some thinning of their ranks student 
protesters decided today to press on with their 10day occupation 
of the square until the government falls 
the vandalism of maos gigantic portrait with red black and 
blue paint by two young men was akin to blasphemy and an isolated 
incident in a remarkably peaceful popular rebellion that has 
galvanized much of the country 
a chinese journalist who saw the attack said the two wearing 
the white headbands of student protesters were seized by students 
student leaders said later that the vandals whereabouts were 
unknown and insisted the two were not students 
mao was communist chinas founder and ruled the country for 27 
years until his death in 1976 his uniform and the blue sky 
background were splattered and dots marred his chin and smeared 
between his eyes 
workers later covered the painting with a tarp 
the prodemocracy student movement launched last month with 
marches and class boycotts demanding press freedom and an end to 
official corruption has won such widespread popular support as to 
tame martial law which premier li declared in beijing on saturday 
todays march in the square was at least the third such huge 
outpouring of support for the students in a week marchers called 
for the resignation of li senior leader deng xiaoping and 
president yang shangkun 
intellectuals from the chinese academy of sciences led the 
protest accusing li of staging a military coup in his struggle 
with communist party chief zhao ziyang li apparently acted on 
orders of the 84yearold deng 
people unite and break the militaristic coup read one 
poster bury the cult of the individual end old peoples 
politics read another 
a bus designed by the central academy of fine arts broadcast for 
a free press a painting on the bus showed red lips crisscrossed by 
two rifles we will not be silenced read one slogan 
heavy showers ended most of the protest suddenly students 
wandered about the square with sheets of plastic over their heads 
others held wet flags 
several hundred men wearing blue raincoats bicycled to the 
square through the rain chanting li peng step down 
the rest of the capital was calm with subways reopened and many 
bus lines running after a tense weekend in which hundreds of 
thousands of people spontaneously set up roadblocks to protect the 
students from troops 
many military and communist party leaders have opposed using 
troops to crack down on the demonstrators 
student leaders met today and decided despite the exodus of 
thousands of demonstrators who are returning to their schools to 
continue their occupation of the square that is chinas symbolic 
center of power 
it was not known how the vandalism of the mao painting one of 
communist chinas most important symbols would affect the protest 
i voted that we should go back because many of the beijing 
students are already leaving said gua haifeng a student leader 
from beijing university but the student union insists on 
struggling until the end they want to see the government fall 
more than half of the protesters on the square hail from outside 
beijing 
we just couldnt leave said a student from lanzhou a 
western city about 750 miles from beijing tiananmen square is 
the center of our student movement if it died the movement in 
lanzhou and all around china would die too 
protesters said li and yang had were trying to take over the 
government by replacing ministers and using troops to occupy 
important media outlets 
a source at the peoples daily earlier had said that troops had 
occupied that newspaper along with the official xinhua news agency 
and the central television and radio stations 
but the allegations about replaced ministers could not be 
confirmed nor could a rumor that li had taken the responsibility 
for propaganda out of the hands of politburo member hu qili 
rumor and innuendo filled beijing intellectuals most of whom 
sympathize with zhao a relatively liberal reformer have been as 
much to blame as the supporters of li and yang both conservatives 
earlier reports said zhao had offered to resign his post as 
chief of the communist party in meetings during the second week of 
may now the same sources are saying zhao prepared his resignation 
papers but reneged at the last minute when he saw li becoming 
increasingly weak 
indeed lis inability to carry out the martial law crackdown 
has hurt his position on monday senior military officers and 
legislators criticized the crackdown 
seven highranking officers including former defense minister 
zhang aiping wrote an open letter to the peoples daily saying 
that to keep the situation from worsening the army cannot enter 
the city 
chinese sources said members of the national peoples congress 
began collecting signatures to open a special session to consider 
the legality of martial law 
central radio reported that several soldiers were seriously 
injured in a brief clash monday night with local residents in 
southwest beijing it said some had been hospitalized several 
local residents were also hurt

conservative politburo member yegor k ligachev 
has told communist party leaders their honor as well as his own had 
been hurt by a prominent prosecutors accusations of corruption 
tass reported today 
ligachev accused prosecutor nikolai ivanov of provocation and 
malicious invention for saying on national television on may 12 
that ligachevs name had come up in a bribery case 
slanderous accusations of this kind affect not only my own 
honor and dignity but also the honor and prestige of the party 
politburo ligachev told a meeting of the partys policymaking 
central committee on monday tass said 
ivanov also said his investigations had touched on two former 
politburo members mikhail solomentsev and grigory romanov both 
retired after president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 
the central committee was meeting to discuss thursdays 
inaugural session of the new congress of peoples deputies which 
will elect the president from among its ranks as wekk as a smaller 
more active supreme soviet legislature 
the 251member committee endorsed gorbachev for reelection as 
president ligachev and ivanov were elected to the new congress 
ivanov also has said he would do his best to see that the 
conservative ligachev a potential gorbachev opponent would not be 
elected to the supreme soviet which will hold much of the 
congress legislative power 
ligachev said ivanov was trying to discredit the party 
leadership and further his own political career 
he called on the politburo to investigate media abuses connected 
with leaks from prosecutors 
some publications have given investigators broad opportunities 
for defaming people accusing them well before trial of crimes 
thus deluding millions of people he told the central committee 
ivanov said at a mass meeting held in moscow on sunday that the 
party apparatus must give up its hold on power he has not 
disclosed further details of the bribery case 
ivanov and his boss telman gdlyan are themselves being 
investigated on alleged abuses of power connected with their 
highlevel corruption cases 
a separate investigation by the supreme court has determined 
that in 1983 gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in estonia who 
later died in prison the court has asked the national prosecutors 
office to consider dismissing gdlyan as a result 
gdlyan also is a member of the new congress 
he and ivanov won fame for an uzbekistan bribery case that sent 
yuri churbanov soninlaw of late leader leonid i brezhnev to 
prison for 12 years

authorities have issued a warning 
about possible attacks on airliners and have ordered airports in 
the country to tighten security officials said today 
the warning came less than a week after a frankfurt court 
convicted mohammed ali hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem of murder 
and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a twa airliner and 
sentenced him to life imprisonment 
officials said after wednesdays verdict that hamadis sentence 
raised the danger of attacks by terrorists on west german targets 
the latest warning did not specify the reasons for the alert it 
came shortly before the start of the busy summer tourist season 
that further strains the nations already crowded major airports 
the warning was disclosed in a statement released by the 
bavarian transport ministry it said the warning came from the 
federal interior ministry and was sent to all west german regional 
authorities and airports in the country 
the danger of attacks against air traffic has risen 
recently the bavarian statement said summarizing the 
information it had received from federal security officials 
the statement did not say if authorities had specific 
information about an impending attack 
bernd lenze spokesman for the bavarian transport ministry 
declined to discuss the reasons that led to tighter airport 
security 
lenze also refused to give details about the security measures 
authorities were taking 
but the statement said airport security staff were told to 
conduct more elaborate inspections of luggage and passengers will 
have to count on longer checkin times 
after the verdict in hamadis trial the west german foreign 
ministry warned its diplomats to be on the alert for possible 
retaliation 
newspaper reports also said authorities were on the lookout for 
possible terrorist action at home following hamadis sentencing 
the frankfurt court ruled that hamadi was a member of hezbollah 
or party of god the radical shiite moslem group is backed by iran 
and is believed to be holding western hostages in beirut 
the court said hamadi had been in contact with hezbollah 
terrorists operating in europe before his arrest at frankfurt 
airport in january 1987 hamadi was convicted of the hijacking and 
slaying of us navy diver robert stethem 
two west german relief workers are still missing in lebanon 
after reportedly being kidnapped the day before hamadis sentencing 
a terrorist bombing is believed responsible for the dec 7 crash 
of pan am flight 103 which blew up over lockerbie scotland 
killing 270 people the flight originated in frankfurt and changed

extinction earlier this year cranked out nearly 59 million in 
1988 for house members who wrote articles and gave speeches to 
specialinterest groups 
the honoraria figures compiled by the public interest group 
common cause came from the annual house financial disclosure 
statements that were released monday 
the final honoraria figures for the year could surpass the 1987 
total of 67 million once financial disclosure forms are received 
from an additional 20 lawmakers who were granted extensions of up 
to 30 days in which to file their reports the reports not yet 
available included that of house ways and means committee chairman 
dan rostenkowski dill the 1987 honoraria leader with 245000

honoraria in 1988 leaders slightly more the amount over the 
limit more than 1 million was donated to charity while nearly 
48 million was kept for personal use

investments while others made money in more unorthodox ways 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo a northern cheyenne 
indian earned 5000 last year for his jewelry designs

association player received deferred income totaling 45000 from 
the washington bullets and atlanta hawks

203579 and assets ranging from 31005100000 these figures do 
not include holdings in a blind trust established by wright in 
1987 those assets and the income they produced were not available 
monday 
the speaker earned 30000 in honoraria a figure eclipsed by 45 
other house members who filed on monday 
wright paid off debts totaling between 105000 and 220000 
including money he owed to his former investment partnership 
mallightco and a bank

the honoraria system was in jeopardy early this year when house 
leaders were ready to abolish it and institute other reforms in 
return for a 51 percent pay raise the effort collapsed when a 
furious public let lawmakers know they opposed the increase 
the fees of 2000 a speech are controversial because 
invitations usually come from specialinterest groups courting 
lawmakers and because often the events are held at resorts where 
members and their spouses can enjoy free vacations

orders to factories for big ticket durable 
goods shot up 29 percent in april the best showing in four 
months the government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last at least three years rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 1291 billion last month after climbing 1 percent in 
march and declining during the first two months of the year 
the report reflected renewed demand in all major industry 
categories after broad weakness earlier this year the biggest 
increase came in orders for electrical machinery up 94 percent to 
20 billion 
last months 29 percent increase was the biggest since a 74 
percent jump recorded last december 
orders reached a high of 1321 billion in december but have 
yet to return to that level after the downturns in january and 
february 
analysts had cited the firstquarter weakness in orders for 
durable goods as evidence that growth has begun to slow as the 
economy extends into the seventh year of a record peacetime 
expansion 
the declines in orders in january and february represented the 
first backtoback drops in three years and the march increase was 
attributed solely to a big surge in aircraft orders that masked 
broader weakness 
a variety of other government reports on the economys 
performance so far this year also have indicated that growth is 
slowing in response to a yearlong campaign by the federal reserve 
board to restrain inflation by dampening demand 
aprils increase in orders for durable goods was an even 
stronger 47 percent when orders in the volatile defense category 
are excluded it was the first increase in nondefense orders since 
a 62 percent rise last december 
defense orders dropped 163 percent in april after surging 285 
percent in march and 197 percent in february 
transportation orders also subject to wide swings depending on 
when big contracts are signed rose 06 percent in april with most 
of the increase reflecting higher demand for autos and parts 
demand for aircraft and parts continued to remain high 
excluding transportation all other orders were up 39 percent 
the first increase since a 22 percent rise last december it was 
the biggest jump in nontransportation orders since a 48 percent 
jump in april 1987 
in other industries orders for primary metals such as steel 
rose 56 percent and orders for nonelectrical machinery were up 
14 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods watched as a 
sign of business investment plans orders were up 55 percent in 
april after rising 26 percent in march it was the best showing 
since a 101 percent increase in december 
shipments of durable goods also rose last month increasing 23 
percent to a seasonally adjusted 1231 billion shipments had 
declined during the previous three months

french doctors working with american and soviet 
colleagues in soviet georgia confirmed today that some

killed by toxic gases 
on the basis of 16 autopsy results doctors identified 
chloropicrine as responsible for some deaths according to medecins 
sans frontiers a parisbased medical humanitarian group 
chloropicrine was approved in the soviet union as a tear gas

stronger than tear gas 
in a statement the french doctors said several hundred people 
were admitted to hospitals more than a week later believing they 
suffered secondary effects from the toxic gases but the 
international team concluded they suffered instead from panic 
caused by psychological trauma 
the french doctors worked with american colleagues from 
physicians for human rights with georgian doctors and with 
representatives from the georgian health ministry according to the

bostons teachers would get a 7 percent raise 
three years in a row and more power in their classrooms but would 
be held more responsible for their students performance under 
terms of a tentative contract 
school superintendent laval s wilson and teachers union 
president edward doherty announced the pact monday and called it a 
landmark agreement on education reform 
but city officials warned that because of a state budget crisis 
the city might not be able to afford the raises for the unions 
6000 members 
i do not see at this time how a contract of this magnitude 
can be funded given the fiscal uncertainties facing the 
commonwealth mayor raymond flynn said 
the contract must be ratified by the school committee and then 
is expected to be approved by the union in june 
teachers would have more of a say in choosing staff and would 
have a role in setting curriculum and budget priorities through 
school councils in return teachers would be subjected to more 
detailed reviews of their performance 
union and school officials say the pact is modeled on teachers 
contracts in dade county fla and rochester ny

a palestinian appeal to the arab summit in 
morocco urges arab leaders to reject israels peace plan and 
demands that the united states support a free palestinian state a 
proplo newspaper said today 
in tunisia where the arab leaders are meeting the palestine 
liberation organization issued an official version of the 
latest uprising leaflet omitting an earlier call for retaliatory 
slayings of israelis 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip israeli troops shot 
and wounded five palestinian youths during stonethrowing protests 
today arab news reports said a general strike continued in the 
territories 
prime minister yitzhak shamir rejected us secretary of state 
james bakers call for israel to stop building jewish settlements 
on occupied land and essentially ignored bakers appeal to give up 
the idea of a greater israel including the west bank and gaza 
i dont know how it is possible to speak at all of a greater 
israel israel is a very small country it sounds really ironic 
to speak of a greater israel he said on israel radio 
shamir in london meeting british officials also said i do 
not see any connection between settlements and the issue of the 
peace process 
palestinians in the occupied lands reacted favorably to bakers 
comments which came monday in a speech in washington but noted he 
still said the united states does not favor a palestinian state 
i believe bakers statement is positive but it is not the 
change that the palestinian is asking for said newspaper editor 
ziad abu ziad 
the arab league convenes today and the appeal to be presented to 
participants was published by the east jerusalembased al fajr a 
daily allied with the mainstream fatah branch of the plo 
it urged arab nations to form a higher committee to support 
palestinian peace proposals which call for israeli withdrawal from 
the occupied lands and an international peace conference 
it also sought support for palestinian opposition in rejecting 
the israeli government plan to hold elections under occupation 
shamirs peace plan calls for palestinians in the territories to 
elect representatives to negotiate with israel on an interim period 
of selfrule 
palestinians object because the proposal does not guarantee 
independence or an end to military rule 
arab leaders also were asked to call on the united states for 
clear recognition of palestinian rights to selfdetermination 
meaning an independent state 
meanwhile a palestinian man from the west bank town of dura was 
killed monday when his car was stoned in southern israel 
the death brought to 497 the number of arabs killed since the 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule began 17 months ago 
twentytwo israelis also have been killed 
wafa the palestinian news agency published the official text 
of leaflet no 40 which supports killing palestinians who 
collaborate with israel but drops an earlier appeal to kill a 
settler or a soldier for every martyr of our sons 
plo spokesman abdel abdulrahman said such a call could have 
been included in a first draft 
also today an army spokesman confirmed soldiers had plowed 
through arab land to build a road just inside the border with the 
gaza strip for security reasons 
an international development worker in gaza said the road was 
about 8 miles long and 20 yards wide the development worker who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said small farms that contained 
orange and olive trees and wheat and chickpea fields had been 
destroyed to build the road

iranian revolutionary patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini underwent surgery today to stop internal bleeding 
in his digestive system tehran radio reported 
the radio broadcast a statement from khomeinis office saying 
the 89yearold iranian leader was in satisfactory condition 
following the operation and that progress reports about his health 
would follow 
there have been persistent reports that khomeini has been in 
poor health he has been reported to be in frail condition since 
suffering a heart attack in 1986 
the statement from his office said 
we inform the public that with the grace of god and the 
attention of the hidden imam the operation on imam khomeini which 
was undertaken tuesday morning to stop bleeding in his digestive 
system was successfully completed and praise the lord his 
condition is completely satisfactory 
in paris ayatollah mehdi rouhani spiritual leader of the 
european shiite community called the associated press to say he 
had information that khomeini had lost a great deal of blood 
and was in precarious condition 
he would not say who his sources were or provide details 
khomeini was last shown speaking on television also monitored 
in nicosia during an audience with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze in february 
he seems fragile and slow moving in his frequent appearances on 
television attending prayer audiences at the jamaran mosque near 
his north tehran home 
he lifts himself out of his chair after the meetings but does 
not speak 
there have been scores of stories since the reported heart 
attack that he was dead or dying with unconfirmed reports saying 
he has cancer of the prostate 
aside from the audiences khomeini does not circulate in public 
outside his home 
factions within the iranian government have been vying for 
control of postkhomeini iran with the competition deepening in 
march when he deposed his designated successor ayatollah ali 
montazeri 
last week khomeinis son ahmad published a long diatribe 
against montazeri 64 for questioning his fathers policies 
ahmad 43 has long been a close aide of his father and his 
attack on montazeri underlined his increasingly high political 
profile 
khomeini appointed a 20man committee last month to review the 
succession question and recomment changes to the 1979 constitution 
to correct what he called flaws and imperfections 
so far the committee composed of senior political legal and 
religious figures has concentrated on the shape of the future 
government 
tehran newspapers said the committee is likely to give more 
power to the presidency possibly by scrapping the premiership to 
eliminate competing power centers that have paralyzed the 
decisionmaking process during 10 years of revolutionary rule 
the signs were that in the absence of any single figure with the 
patriarchs political and religious authority iran will likely be 
governed in the postkhomeini era by a collective leadership 
khomeini has managed to confound those who say he has been 
weakened physically and politically 
khomeini in february ordered moslems to seek out and kill the 
indianborn british author salman rushdie for blasphemy for his 
treatment of islam in his novel the satanic verses 
he later accused iranians of lacking revolutionary zeal and used 
the campaign against the book as a platform to back radical leaders 
and criticize liberals questioning the goals of the revolution

authorities have jailed 237 ethnic 
albanians without charge in the volatile province of kosovo a 
regional official said today 
those detained are people who acted in the interests of 
albanian nationalism and separatism and who in kosovo exposed their 
hostile positions said jusuf karakusi the provinces interior 
minister the state tanjug news agency said 
kosovo was the scene in february and march of mass 
demonstrations and violent clashes between ethnic albanians and 
yugoslav security forces the battles killed at least 25 people 
including two policemen 
ethnic albanians who comprise about 85 percent of kosovos 
population of 18 million were protesting constitutional changes 
that limited the wide autonomy the province had previously enjoyed 
the new rules gave serbia of which the region is an administrative 
part a greater say kosovos affairs 
the imposition of a state of emergency was followed by a 
crackdown in which more than 800 people were arrested on charges 
stemming from the unrest 
an additional 237 have been detained under isolation 
measures which are permitted under emergency law said karakusi 
among those jailed without charges or trial are prominent ethnic 
albanian politicians intellectuals and other community leaders who 
opposed the constitutional amendments press reports said 
among them is azem vllasi the former local communist party 
chief and a leading opponent of serbian strongman slobodan 
milosevic 
the detentions without trial represent a flagrant violation 
not only of the prisoners civil rights but also of universal 
human rights said a commentary in the latest issue of danas 
yugoslavias leading newsmagazine 
the legal status of the detainees is undefined and unclear 
they are not supposed to be in jail but have spent months behind 
bars danas said

li would be forced from office for refusing to hold talks with the 
students and resorting instead to military force to end their 
movement rumor and innuendo filled beijing about battles for 
control between liberal and conservative wings of the ruling 
communist party 
hong kong commercial radio reported that the politburo the 
communist partys top decisionmaking body decided today to strip 
li a 60yearold former electrical engineer of both his 
government and party posts 
it said communist party chief zhao ziyang whose position was 
jeopardized when he advocated compromise with the students and 
opposed lis hardline stance will resume his duties 
the report could not be immediately confirmed 
one indication that li might be in trouble was the first 
official acknowledgement that the premier was the primary object of 
demonstrators anger 
the official xinhua news agency said 1 million people took to 
the streets and the overwhelming majority of the slogans of the 
parade were directed against the chief leader of the state 
council namely li

martial law and safeguard the constitution and guarantee human 
rights leading intellectuals from chinas most famous 
thinktank the chinese academy of sciences led the protest they

paint on the famed portrait of the founder of communist china 
a witness said the two men wearing the white headbands of 
student protesters were jumped on by students and taken to 
tiananmen square student leaders later insisted the men were not 
students 
thousands stopped to watch the 90minute operation of lifting 
the new portrait into place they cheered and clapped when the work 
was completed 
as in the previous three nights under martial law a constant 
stream of supporters walked bicycled and motorcycled around the 
square occupied by tens of thousands of students 
most of the troops that moved into city outskirts friday night 
had withdrawn to points further away from the city and residents 
had removed many of the barricades they had set up to block a troop 
advance into the city 
the students decided earlier in the day to continue their 
occupation of the square even though thousands of demonstrators had 
returned to their schools more than half of the protesters on the 
square hail from outside beijing 
i voted that we should go back because many of the beijing 
students are alrady leaving said gua haifeng a student leader 
from beijing university but the student union insists on 
struggling until the end they want to see the government fall

citizenship at the height of the stagnation period the 
current leaderships reference to the era of the late soviet leader

reformers in the new soviet parliament scrambled 
tuesday to prevent the communist party from orchestrating the 
opening session and cutting them out of positions of power 
with the congress of peoples deputies set to convene on 
thursday progressives are gathering to share their ideas for 
solving the soviet unions many crises they also are gloating over 
what they hope is the impending fall of the bureaucrats responsible 
a year ago they had nothing working against them and now 
theyre holding on tooth and nail said ulo vooglaid a deputy 
from estonia 
members of cooperatives want to repeal a decree that kicked them 
out of profitable businesses armenians want a solution to 
festering ethnic problems and baltic leaders want economic 
independence 
a small group of moscowbased reformers has written an alternate 
agenda but progressives from around the country have not yet 
coalesced enough to plan tactics to substitute their priorities for 
those of the communist party 
if we discuss things at the congress like we are discussing 
them today we wont accomplish anything one unidentified 
parliamentarian told the moscow deputies club on tuesday 
most speakers offered wish lists of problems to be tackled and 
oppressive laws to be repealed 
meanwhile the moreorganized communist party armed with 
copying machines that long were outlawed in the soviet union is 
ready to ram through its own program it has set its own agenda for 
a shortlived congress and devised its own slate for election to 
the smaller working parliament where the real power will lie said 
historian yuri afanasiev a deputy from moscow 
the 2250member congress is the soviet unions first 
representative parliament in more than 70 years to be chosen in 
largely multicandidate elections but it is supposed to meet just 
once a year to elect a 542member supreme soviet that will serve as 
the virtually fulltime legislature 
the partys policymaking central committee held a closed 
session monday to discuss the upcoming congress and within hours 
its officials were trying to win deputies support for the partys 
slate for the supreme soviet 
russian federation president and politburo member vitaly i 
vorotnikov presented a monday night meeting of deputies from the 
russian republic with a list of 147 partyapproved representatives 
to be named from russia said sergei stankevich a leader of the 
moscow deputies club 
many deputies on the list never even knew they were 
selected stankevich said they were just appointed again by 
the party leadership without any input from the public or their 
elected representatives he said 
stankevich said he could agree with some people on the list 
such as human rights activist andrei sakharov but many were the 
same old bureaucrats and the russian deputies managed to avoid 
taking a vote on the party slate 
but afanasiev said such timid responses wont be sufficient 
deputies at that meeting looked like rabbits facing a 
python he said we should not plead we should demand 
the progressives idealism seems to be working against any 
serious backroom politicking in the remaining hours before the 
opening of the congress 
we are working out a list of progressive deputies to suggest 
for the supreme soviet stankevich allowed but in principle it 
should be done at the congress 
the moscow club which attracted reformers from kiev the 
baltics and astrakhan on the caspian sea decided its first battle 
must be preventing the party from scheduling the election of the 
president and supreme soviet to be first on the agenda 
progressives want the congress at the very least to pass 
resolutions on key points of economic and political reform before 
turning power over to the supreme soviet 
sakharov goes further calling for the congress to replace the 
supreme soviet as the legislative body 
if someone stands up with a list and we vote for it we have 
failed afanasiev said 
maverick communist boris yeltsin read the moscow reformers 
agenda to the party plenum on monday but it was ignored several 
deputies said 
the communist party continued its organizing efforts tuesday 
with a meeting in the grand kremlin palace of deputies who are also 
party members it was open to any deputy but closed to the public 
and journalists 
another closed meeting was scheduled for wednesday to finalize 
the agenda for the congress 
around the country hopes are rising the congress will prove the 
salvation of the nation taking action on issues from the crippled 
economy to control of the kgb 
the people expect very much unfortunately said yuri 
shcherbak a kiev deputy known for his writings on the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant disaster the people expect us to be able to 
solve everything immediately 
another deputy who identified himself as a pilot from 
astrakhan warned that if the congress is not democratic the 
tension will increase in the country if we fail it will be even 
worse

as rumors about resignations and troop movements 
fly throughout beijing chinese are searching for a rare commodity 
reliable information 
rumors have been rife since the students began their occupation 
of tiananmen square on may 13 calling for democratic reforms 
press freedom and an end to corruption 
there were early reports that communist party chief zhao ziyang 
had resigned offered his resignation or had been fired others 
said premier li peng the hardline head of government who has 
refused to give in to student demands was forced to step down 
because of the unpopularity of martial law which he imposed 
saturday still other reports said senior leader deng xiaoping had 
resigned 
in keeping with the tightly controlled nature of the communist 
government none has been officially denied and few can be 
confirmed 
the tiananmen protesters rely on a network of what the chinese 
call xiaodao xiaoxi or information via small paths the 
grapevine 
i heard from someone is an oftrepeated refrain concerning 
locations of tanks armored vehicles and personnel trucks one 
rumor that has been confirmed by separate chinese sources is that 
up to 70000 troops have moved into buildings surrounding the 
square ready to swoop in on protesters 
activists are sent to the countryside to inform students there 
of developments at the heart of the movement others converge on 
beijing bringing news of protests as well as money raised to 
support the protests 
many reports brought to the square by word of mouth are blared 
over an improvised system of loudspeakers the students call the 
broadcast station 
in the first week of the protests little news of the students 
activities was conveyed by the statecontrolled press but the 
science and technology news printed some of the antigovernment 
slogans on april 23 and on may 9 emboldened journalists 
petitioned the government for press freedoms 
by the time of street protests involving more than 1 million 
singing and chanting marchers may 16 papers were splashed with 
photos of demonstrators letters supporting them and even pictures 
of journalists linking arms in the name of democracy viewers saw 
basically unbiased tv reports as well 
the peoples daily the official communist party newspaper 
backed down from a shrill april 26 editorial calling the student 
movement a planned conspiracy and covered the students with 
unusual candor 
but with martial law came toneddown press reports less 
coverage on tv and statements and letters urging the students to 
leave the square 
on monday the peoples daily sent mixed signals it carried a 
stern commentary saying a few people were manipulating the 
students movement and that all soldiers supported the armys role 
under martial law something that sources within the peoples 
liberation army say is not true 
but there also was a photograph of crowds cheering a retreating 
army truck with a smiling officer saluting them back and a report 
from budapest on how hungarian premier miklos nemeth condemned the 
use of military force to quell domestic uprisings 
the newspaper apparently was trying to convey that the army was 
there to do a job but that it was the friend of the masses 
news reports tuesday noted that while nearly a million people 
took part in marches around the square life in the capital had 
returned to normal 
one of the main sources of information for chinese has been the 
voice of america and the bbc 
we always listen to voa said a student on the square from 
changsha in hunan province the hometown of mao tsetung its 
pretty objective and they tell us a lot more than television 
voa estimates its listening audience for its chineselanguage 
broadcasts is in the tens of millions 
but chinese authorities began jamming voa broadcasts monday and 
students on tiananmen square asked foreigners why the broadcasts 
had stopped 
there has also been a surge in the number of telephone calls to 
china from the united states atampt the only us telephone company 
that handles calls to china reported more than 30000 calls on 
friday the day before martial law was declared about three times 
the normal number

lawyers began questioning 70 potential jurors 
today for the perjury trial of former us rep pat swindall on 
charges of lying to a grand jury about a loan deal 
defense attorneys asked the judge to strike one of the first 
people interviewed after he admitted having subliminal feelings 
against swindall 
but the juror later said he would be able to follow the doctrine 
that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty and us district 
judge richard freeman allowed him to remain you cant get a 
perfect jury freeman said 
the judge has said he wants to see if an impartial jury can be 
seated before ruling on swindalls request to move the trial out of 
town because of publicity 
on monday freeman said swindalls attorneys want the court to 
exclude from evidence secretly recorded talks among swindall 
moneylaunderer charles lechasney and an undercover agent freeman 
did not immediately rule on the request 
the former twoterm republican congressman was indicted oct 17 
on 10 counts of perjury each charge carries 10 months to five 
years in prison 
the 38yearold conservative evangelical is accused of lying 
under oath to a federal grand jury in 1988 about his dealings with 
lechasney and with mike mullaney a federal agent posing as a money 
broker possibly for drug dealers 
swindall lost his seat representing atlantas eastern suburbs to 
democrat ben jones in novembers election 
prosecution briefs unsealed earlier showed the government 
building a claim that swindall plotted to lie publicly about a 
shady loan deal then did lie about it 
in one brief unsealed in the court prosecutors argued that 
public statements swindall made after his allegedly false grand 
jury testimony are relevant to the case because they point to a 
continuation of swindalls attempts to limit his own potential 
criminal exposure 
swindalls attorneys want the tapes thrown out on the grounds 
that they have no bearing on whether he perjured himself earlier 
in one conversation that prosecutors want to enter as evidence 
mullaney posing as a broker funneling swindall money through 
lechasney as middleman asked swindall what he would say if anyone 
started asking questions 
whats wrong if i say i sold the note to someone charles 
lechasney introduced me to and i dont know what his name is and i 
really didnt care the congressman replied 
theres no question in this transaction that i am basically 
using charles as my buffer swindall said in another conversation 
related in the prosecution document

ussoviet negotiations to reduce longrange 
nuclear weapons will resume on june 19 secretary of state james a 
baker iii announced today 
the talks were suspended last november with about 90 percent of 
the work completed on a new treaty sharply cutting back 
oceanspanning bombers missiles and nuclear submarines 
the negotiations tentatively had been set to resume in february 
but president bush ordered a delay for a reassessment of us arms 
control policy and strategic weaponry 
the review was recently concluded and baker on a trip to moscow 
two weeks ago reached an agreement with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev for a resumption of the negotiations the precise date in 
june was left open until now 
the soviets had been eager to resume but waited for completion 
of the review 
baker has said the us position in the geneva talks would be to 
pick up where the reagan administration left off as it sought a 
cutback of 30 percent to 50 percent but baker said the 
administration also reserved the option to make some changes he 
did not say what differences might emerge at the bargaining table 
among the unsettled issues are whether to try to restrict mobile 
landbased missiles and how to verify reductions in such elusive 
arms as sealaunched and airlaunched cruise missiles 
max m kampelman who was chief armscontrol negotiator in the 
reagan administration has said a treaty could be completed within 
a few months that is not clear in light of possible new us 
bargaining positions 
the soviets also were determined to restrict the us strategic 
defense initiative or star wars program that seeks to construct a 
defense against ballistic missiles 
the strategic weapons are the most potent in the world 
the two superpowers in 1987 concluded a treaty to eliminate 
another class of nuclear arms intermediaterange missiles that 
can travel from 300 to 3000 miles the pact also established a 
system of verification that involves soviet monitors going to us 
installations and american inspectors operating on soviet territory 
a third category of nuclear arms socalled battlefield or 
tactical missiles has not been subject to negotiations 
the west german government with support from several north 
atlantic treaty organization allies have urged the united states 
to negotiate reductions or even total elimination of the 
groundbased missiles with moscow but the us position is that 
the missiles should be improved and are essential to the defense of 
western europe 
shortrange nuclear weapons have a range of under 300 miles

syrians shelled the christian coast again 
tuesday and lebanese appeared to have little hope that arab leaders 
meeting in morocco could end an artillery war that has killed 
hundreds of civilians 
police said at least three dozen shells fired from syrian 
positions in and near moslem west beirut hit the coast around 
byblos an ancient port 20 miles north of the capital 
no casualties or serious damage were reported from the shelling 
intended to prevent ships from delivering arms and food to the 1 
million christians besieged in their 310squaremile enclave north 
and east of beirut 
syrian forces have continued bombarding the coast north of the 
city despite a ceasefire called may 11 by the arab league which 
began a summit tuesday in casablanca 
christian military units as well as the syrians and druse 
militiamen allied with them were reported to be resupplying 
artillery and rocket batteries in preparation for a renewal of 
major fighting 
no ones making a secret of it a police spokesman said 
a christian official said the atmosphere is one of 
preparation for a major outbreak of fighting 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league and has become the main power broker 
in the chaos of a 14yearold civil war 
the latest fighting began march 8 two days after gen michel 
aouns christian army units blockaded illegal ports run by moslem 
militias druse militiamen led by walid jumblatt responded with 
artillery fire and syrian gunners soon joined them 
a mediation committee from the arab league has been trying to 
stop the fighting which police say has killed at least 359 people 
and wounded nearly 1400 almost all of them civilians 
syria pledged to observe the truce on land but said its forces 
would continue shelling the christian coast to prevent resupply by 
sea 
in recent days syrian gunboats operating from tripoli in 
northern lebanon have turned back at least one ship a freighter 
bound for the christian enclave with a cargo of food 
christians say they have been able to land three shiploads of 
ammunition and food by using small boats to ferry the supplies 
ashore at night from cargo vessels anchored several miles out 
iraq has supplied arms to the christians since a ceasefire aug 
20 in its 8yearold war with iran iraq and syria which supported 
iran in the war are enemies of long standing 
on monday and tuesday the syrians were seen moving more than 60 
truckloads of ammunition from the bekaa valley in east lebanon to 
artillery and rocket positions in west beirut 
soldiers unloaded howitzer shells rockets and mortar rounds 
from dozens of trucks along beaches near the airport where most of 
syrias heavy weapons are deployed 
aoun and his allies of the lebanese forces the main christian 
militia also were trucking ammunition to artillery emplacements a 
christian source said food drinking water and fuel were being 
stockpiled 
in west beirut and other syriancontrolled areas civilians were 
buying up canned food bottled water and fuel in expectations of 
having to spend days in underground bunkers shops and banks 
sandbagged entrances and windows 
lebanons seat at the summit is vacant because other arab 
nations do not recognize either of the rival governments set up 
when president amin gemayels term ended in september and 
parliament could not agree on a successor

drugs addicts at the dade county stockade got the 
point today 10 points to be exact as part of a treatment 
program using acupuncture 
the new program will treat 1500 inmates at a cost of about 
600000 a year said circuit judge herbert klein the countys 
antidrug coordinator 
i dont feel theres any other way i could be helped this is 
the last way said terry henderson 20 he described the 
insertion of 10 twoinch needles in his ears as feeling like a 
mosquito bite 
henderson is serving a oneyear sentence for cocaine sale and 
possession he said he smoked crack daily before his arrest 
the program is aimed at helping addicts relax and reducing their 
craving for drugs but some doctors say there havent been enough 
scientific studies to determine if acupuncture actually eases 
withdrawal symptoms 
acupuncturist bill berlin who has been pushing for the program 
for four years said he has an 80 percent success rate in private 
practice but he said the jail program would be more difficult 
part of the recovery is rebuilding their lives as well as 
eliminating the need for drugs he said counseling is the 
other half of the drug treatment 
developed more than 2500 years ago by the chinese acupuncture 
is a technique to relieve pain and stress by inserting needles into 
specific points on the body that are believed to affect organs and 
bodily functions 
klein endorsed the program which originated at a new york city 
hospital after finding at least threequarters of the defendants 
entering the miami courts are on drugs 
in the acupuncture program that started monday 224 inmates will 
undergo daily needling as klein called it and intensive 
therapy for four weeks 
for the next 12 weeks prisoners will receivelessfrequent 
acupuncture treatments while attending educational and vocational 
programs and joining work details 
in the final 30 days of treatment inmates will be moved to a 
detention center assigned to kitchen duty and continue drug abuse 
treatment

a massive undersea earthquake was 
recorded today north of australias macquarie island near new 
zealand officials said 
kevin mccue senior research scientist at the australian 
seismological centre said the quake occurred at 654 am edt and 
measured about 72 on the richter scale 
the us geological survey reported the quake measured 82 on 
the richter scale and said it was the strongest temblor this year 
anywhere in the world it was the strongest since one measuring 81 
on october 20 1986 in the kermadec islands in the pacific the 
survey said 
mccue said a stretch of seabed apparently was ruptured in a 
large movement at the junction of the australian and pacific 
plates about 850 miles east of christchurch new zealand 
according to the australian associated press 
alison clifton australias macquarie island station leader 
said by telephone that a fairly severe quake rattled buildings 
at the base but did no damage the australian news agency reported 
it was pretty noisy she said it was certainly sizeable

rocked manebhanjyang 175 miles east of katmandu at 425 pm edt 
monday according to the department of mines and geology 
it said there were no reports of casualties or property damage 
the openended richter scale is a measure of the energy released 
by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a 
seisomograph 
each increase of one number as in a jump from magnitude 55 to 
65 means the ground motion is 10 times greater a quake of 35 
can cause slight damage in populated areas while a quake of 60 
can cause severe damage in march 1964 an earthquake in alaska hit

the provincial court refused today to 
register the prosolidarity independent students association 
causing howls of surprised anger and chants of down with 
communism from a packed courtroom 
warsaw provincial judge danuta widawska was unable to explain 
the decision in the tumult that followed it 
provincial court chairman edward sadkowski later said the 
decision stemmed from the student groups claim of the right to 
strike polish law does not specifically grant students that right 
he said 
students said they may boycott june 4 parliamentary elections 
because of the decision some accused the court of trying to 
confuse and divide the opposition before the elections 
before the decision a lawyer for the student association known 
by its polish initials nzs argued that registering the group would 
fulfill the promises that communist authorities made during talks 
with the solidarityled opposition 
lawyer piotr andrzejewski noted authorities objected to the 
associations statute permitting strikes but he told the court 
such strikes have a long tradition in poland and are not forbidden 
about 200 students angered by the rejection marched for about a 
half mile from the court chanting down with communism and 
we will make a second china referring to huge student 
demonstrations in beijing 
scuffles broke out with police when they reached a main square 
and several protesters were arrested 
piotr czerwiec a student leader said the association would 
appeal the courts decision to the supreme court this week but it 
appeared unlikely a decision could be made before the june voting 
students have played an active role in helping solidarity 
candidates in elections bringing the first democratic voting in 
poland since world war ii registration of the students 
assocation like the legalization of the independent workers union 
solidarity and the farmers union rural solidarity was a condition 
for the opposition agreeing to participate in the elections 
all three organizations were banned when martial law was imposed 
in poland in december 1981 the other two were legalized during the 
talks earlier this year with communist authorities on enacting 
reforms 
solidarity is waging a spirited campaign for candidates to a new 
100member senate the first fully democratic legislative chamber 
in the east bloc the opposition also is contesting 161 seats in 
the existing 460member parliament the rest are reserved for the 
ruling communist party and its allies 
some student leaders blamed older solidarity leaders for not 
fighting more for their association 
solidarity did not press hard enough said andrzej 
jesionowski a member of the student associations national 
commission 
earlier about 300 students packed the courtroom with a handful 
of older solidarity advisers the rejection came as a shock 
down with communism someone shouted as soon as mrs 
widawska announced the rejection then the whole room erupted in 
the angry chants and stamping feet 
do you want to hear the justification the judge said 
through her microphone 
no students shouted back and mrs widawska and two 
assistant judges hurriedly left the bench

swedish physicists said today they 
produced a burst of neutron radiation in a roomtemperature 
experiment repeating the work of two chemists who claimed to have 
achieved cold fusion in a jar 
the scientists at the manne siegbahn institute for physics said 
their method was similar to the experiment that chemists stanley 
pons and martin fleischmann said they conducted at the university 
of utah 
in march the two claimed to have produced sustained fusion in a 
jar at much colder temperatures than previously thought possible 
repeated attempts by other scientists to duplicate the 
fleischmannpons experiments have failed 
birger emmoth magnus jandel irena gudowska and waclaw gudowski 
said in a press release they ran an electrical current between 
platinum and palladium electrodes immersed in heavy water 
containing deuterium a variety of hydrogen 
the results indicate fusion reactions can occur at low 
temperatures in the electrode material palladium this gives 
certain support to fleischmann and pons ideas the release said 
the results were reported in a paper to be published by the 
scientific journal physica scripta it did not say when their 
findings might appear in the journal 
in their tests the scientists obtained increasing neutron 
radiation reaching a level up to 10 times greater than natural 
background radiation and lasting up to four hours 
the group said the experiment is difficult to repeat because 
many factors can affect the process in some case their tests 
produced no surplus neutrons 
birger emmoth told stockholm daily svenska dagbladet the tests 
were easier to repeat using new palladium plates of sufficient 
size rather than already used plates and small ones 
electrodes used by the group were three millimetres thick and 
weighed 40 grams svenska dagbladet said 
also the character of a time limited burst of course are in 
line with pons and fleischmanns results even though theirs were 
longer almost 24 hours he said 
their experiments in cooperation with the royal institute of 
technology and arrhenius laboratory in stockholm began in early 
april

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today that a uswest german dispute over shortrange missiles in 
europe remains unresolved and there is still a gap to bridge 
bakers comments at a briefing for reporters on next weeks 
40th anniversary summit meeting of nato indicated that the bush 
adminstration and the government of chancellor helmut kohl had yet 
to find a common ground despite a succesions of proposals and 
counterproposals that have crossed the atlantic 
the dispute over whether to negotiate with the soviet union on 
cutting the nuclear arsenals of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the warsaw pact in europe has split the western 
alliance 
west germany generally has supported such talks the united 
states has voiced opposition to them so long as the east maintains 
a superiority in conventional weapons 
president bush had voiced optimism as recently as sunday 
baker said today were very hopeful that it will be resolved 
before the summit and we remain hopeful i cant tell you that we 
know that it will be 
last friday the us side gave west german defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg a compromise offer that officials in bonn 
privately said opened the door to ussoviet negotiations on the 
missiles eventually 
on monday kohl sent to washington his response to that 
counterproposal us officials did not detail what was contained 
in the latest west german offer but said it did not move the 
process any further along to a compromise 
baker told reporters the stumbling block was how to draft a 
compromise plan that would take into account the new mood in 
western europe for greater disarmament while preserving an 
adequate deterrence 
negotiations would be a mistake i still feel strongly 
baker said of proposals for eastwest talks at this time on 
reducing natos shortrange nuclear weapons 
in addition to opposing talks on reducing the weapons the 
united staes would like to upgrade and extend the range of the 
americanmade lance missiles now stationed in western europe most 
of them in west germany 
asked if the united states and west germany was any closer to 
resolved their differences on the issue baker said it is not 
resolved there is still a gap to bridge and well continue to 
work to try to bridge that gap 
asked whether the dispute would have a lasting harmful effect on 
nato he said the alliance has survived many greater threats to 
its existence than this 
youve got to have the unity of the alliance and then you must 
have arms control policies to support that and you must have 
adequate deterrence we have a wide range of common interests in 
the alliance we are going to be dealing with all of these not 
just shortrange missiles 
baker called recent soviet armsreduction proposals and 
statements mostly a pr public relations ploy

the soviet union spent 238 billion on its manned 
space program since it launched the mir space station in 1986 and 
it has returned only 600000 in commercial fees the head of its 
space agency said tuesday 
alexander dunayev director of the soviet space agency 
glavkosmos noted however that the true profits of space research 
cannot be measured by monetary gains 
he told a news conference that it was the medical and space 
research that made the manned space program valuable not the hard 
currency brought about by the sale of stamps canceled in space or 
the experiments paid for by third parties 
mir the showcase project of the soviet space program that was 
intended to be permanently manned was put in mothballs in april 
because of its expense 
dunayev said the expense of the soviet program compared 
favorably with expenditures with western countries including the 
united states and japan 
these expenditures are economically sound but the question is 
whether we should continue on the same scale dunayev said 
adding that the fate of the entire space program would be in the 
hands of the new congress of peoples deputies which begins 
meeting thursday 
we space officials understand it is of the highest priority 
to science and the world scientific community knows this he 
said 
however dunayev said all delegates to the congress might not 
grasp the significance of manned space research and the agency 
would make every effort to educate them when they understand 
they will be able to take the decision to increase or decrease 
spending he said 
cosmonaut alexander volkov who along with sergei krikalev and 
valery polyakov returned to earth on april 27 after putting mir 
into automatic flight for four months complained that soviet firms 
refuse to use or pay for information gathered during manned flights 
we send information to regions but many times they do not use 
it i regret that what we do we sometimes do in vain he said 
i have this impression that space and earth are working 
separately from one another he said cosmonauts are sending 
the information but there is no response from earth 
he said that if used properly the information could be used in 
agriculture and mining to reap financial benefits for the state 
officials said in april that the overall space effort both 
manned and unmanned programs makes money in 1988 dunayev said 
21 billion was spent while economic benefits from the various 
segments of the program including communications and research was 
32 billion

jim wrights defense opened before a national 
television audience today with his lawyer urging the house ethics 
committee to stand in the way of the lynch mob seeking the 
house speakers resignation 
according to the press jim wrights through hes got to 
resign his speakership maybe even his seat in congress said 
stephen susman attorney for the texas democrat 
why worry about due process for a dead man he asked 
rhetorically why should this committee stand in the way of a 
lynch mob or a conviction based upon guilt by association 
because if a member of congress cannot get a fair trial 
no american can he said 
the arguments were made in a triallike setting with susman and 
his team at a defense table and the ethics committee 
investigators poised behind an identical table across the room a 
central lectern allowed the lawyers to speak while standing before 
the committee which sat behind a raised woodpaneled dais 
wrights wife betty arrived during susmans arguments and took a 
seat in the front row of the audience one of the speakers 
daughters also attended but wright himself did not 
susman was asking the ethics committee today to dismiss key 
charges against wright based on different interpretations of the 
house rules supporters hope for a narrow legal victory that the 
speaker could parlay into political salvation 
however richard phelan the outside counsel who investigated 
wright for the committee argued that the panel should not look 
narrowly at the legal arguments the house code of conduct was 
designed to be comprehensive he said 
this case and this discussion is not about loopholes in tax 
codes phelan said its not about carefully crafting 
legislation to permit persons to evade or to circumvent or to look 
askance 
wrights lawyers contend he is being judged by a new harsher 
standard that goes far beyond the letter of house rules in advance 
of todays hearing they gave themselves no better than an even 
chance of winning dismissal of at least some of the 69 counts 
against him 
but with wrights political support eroding under the weight of 
serious ethics charges even the speakers supporters emphasize the 
importance of persuading the ethics committee to drop at least one 
of the two main charges 
in the month since the panel formally made its charges against 
the speaker his support has eroded members of his own party have 
begun holding meetings to discuss his case and its possible harmful 
effect on their own political situations 
the stakes in todays arguments were heightened by the ethics 
committees decision to allow television coverage of the hearing 
rarely does the panel allow such open coverage but wright said he 
welcomed the chance to have his side of the story presented 
the cspan cable network planned full coverage of the 
proceedings 
susman a tough 48yearold litigator from houston brought in 
this month to bolster the legal team opened the proceeding for 
wright 
susman has a folksy manner that belies shrewdness he 
spearheaded the legal fight of texas hunt brothers after they lost 
big in a bid to corner the silver market and he won a 400 million 
case against pricefixing of cardboard boxes 
phelan a skilled lawyer from chicago who has conducted the 
wright investigation since last july was the author of the tough 
report that led to the charges 
the ethics committee made up of six democrats and six 
republicans was not expected to rule on the motion until later 
this week 
wrights case for dismissal of the most serious charges rested 
on two contentions 
that house rules categorically exempt book royalties from 
limits on outside earned income 
the ethics panel says wright sold bulk quantities of his book 
reflections of a public man to groups he had spoken to instead 
of accepting speaking fees converting what would have been 
improper income into something he could accept wrights lawyers 
call that a tortured reading of the rules and contend book 
royalties are unlimited regardless of the circumstances in which 
they are collected 
that lawmakers can accept benefits from longtime friends so 
long as they are not lobbyists or have other clearly defined direct 
interests in bills before congress 
the committee contends that wrights fort worth business 
partner george mallick had a direct interest in legislation 
because of his extensive financial holdings making the car 
condominium and salary he paid betty wright improper gifts the 
speaker contends mallick had no direct interest in legislation 
as envisioned by the rules 
if the committee were to agree with wrights arguments the case 
against him would be reduced to a few relatively minor violations 
of reporting requirements 
the committee also is investigating but has not brought any 
charges related to an oil and gas well investment that wright and 
mallick made last year the speaker earned 170000 from that 
transaction even though the well turned out to be a commercial 
failure

mankinds growth is accelerating again as the 
world adds the equivalent of another mexico every year the 
population reference bureau reported tuesday 
the private research group said that the worlds population 
growth after having slowed in the 1970s is speeding up once more 
as of mid1989 the world will contain about 524 billion people 
nearly a quarterbillion more than in 1987 
demographers carl haub and mary kent report that the expansion 
from 5 billion to 6 billion could be attained in a record time 
within less than a decade if growth continues at current rates 
the world is adding about 90 million people per year slightly 
more than the current mexican population estimated at 87 million 
the report is in line with one issued a week ago by nafis sadik 
executive director of the united nations population fund that 
report agreed with the reference bureau estimate and the un 
official called for increased access to family planning education 
and employment for women around the globe 
kent and haubs comments accompanied the annual world population 
data sheet a postersize summary of world population trends 
compiled annually by the private group 
even to reach a stable world population size of 10 billion 
double the current total birth rates will have to begin a steady 
descent soon they said 
there have been declines in the growth rate in some developing 
countries such as china thailand and indonesia but there is 
little evidence of change in many others they reported 
unless we see declines in high fertility rates in many african 
and asian countries during the 1990s the prospect for world 
population to level out at less than 10 billion seems very dim 
they said 
as far as ultimate world population size is concerned the 
1990s will truly be a decade of decision they added 
at current rates the worlds population will rise to 63 
billion by the year 2000 and to 83 billion by 2020 the group 
estimated adding that the planets population will double in 39 
years 
the summary notes a sharp difference between developed and 
developing nations 
it reports developed nations currently contain 12 billion 
people and will take 122 years to double their population the 
developing nations however already contain 4 billion and can be 
expected to double in 32 years 
china remains the most populated country on earth with 11 
billion people and an estimated doubling time of 49 years 
second is india with 835 million and it has a faster growth 
rate expected doubling time there is 32 years 
far behind those two population giants the soviet union is 
third with 289 million people and a doubling time of 70 years 
the united states is fourth in population at 248 million and 
this country will likely take 98 years to double that number 
fifth is indonesia with 1846 million people and a doubling 
time of 35 years 
other nations with more than 100 million residents and their 
anticipated doubling times are brazil 147 million 34 years 
japan 123 million 141 years nigeria 115 million 24 years 
bangladesh 115 million 25 years pakistan 110 million 24 years

a delegation from the organization of 
american states arrived here today to investigate charges that gen

to prevent an opposition victory 
we will organize our work and seek meetings with government 
and political figures so we can return to washington to present a 
report filling the mandate of the oas oas secretarygeneral joao 
baena soares said in a statement after arriving at the airport 
the organization last week condemned noriega the nations 
military chief and de factor ruler and called for a transfer of 
power 
foreign minister diego cordovez of ecuador said the mission 
would tell all panamanian sectors that there is concern in latin 
america about panamas crisis 
the delegation is being welcomed by panamas opposition which 
wants the organization to recognize its victory in may 7 
presidential elections international observers say the opposition 
won the elections by a 31 margin noriega nullified the vote after 
it was apparent his candidates were losing 
panamas government has warned the mission should not be turned 
into an international vote tabulation board or an international 
court of appeal 
noriega holds real power in panama because he commands the 
panamanian defense forces he has been indicted on drug charges in 
the united states charges he says are part of a us plot to 
renege on its commitment to give up the panama canal at the end of

president bush is meeting with a chinese 
leader to discuss the turmoil in beijing intent on maintaining a 
moderate us tone despite the chinese decision to jam voice of 
america broadcasts for the first time in 11 years 
the chinese move apparently is an attempt to deprive 
prodemocracy demonstrators of one of their main sources of 
information 
hours after the jamming began wan li head of the chinese 
peoples congress told secretary of state james a baker that the 
beijing government places high priority on a return to normalcy 
after five weeks of turmoil 
today however the chinese lifted a martial law ban on 
satellite transmissions of outgoing us and other foreign news 
videotape 
chinese authorities had cut off transmissions and the military 
dismantled satellite earth stations after the government declared 
martial law in beijing on saturday to put down growing studentled 
unrest 
baker told reporters after the state department meeting that wan 
said china would like to continue the process of opening up and 
reaching out to both their own citizens and to the people around 
the world but that goal depends on a restoration of stability 
baker said he also urged that there be no resort to violence on 
either side in the conflict in china and added that he appreciated 
the restraint that the government had shown thus far 
wan also met with vice president dan quayle on monday and was 
due to meet bush this afternoon 
the jamming was the first by china of voa transmissions since 
before diplomatic relations with the united states were restored in 
1979 
voa director richard w carlson said jamming was detected monday 
morning on three of five frequencies used for mandarin language 
broadcasts beamed to china 
the demonstrators had been relying heavily on voa broadcasts to 
keep informed during the five weeks of prodemocracy protests 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said he was unfamiliar with 
the voa story but he added we are disturbed with any 
interference with news media or communication 
another administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the white house was upset about the jamming but was 
unlikely to raise a public complaint because of the delicacy of the 
situation in beijing 
bush has said he endorses the demonstrators general goal of 
more democracy but he has been careful not to criticize the 
chinese leadership which has been courted by a succession of us 
administrations 
the voa said the jamming was similar to past chinese action 
against taiwanese broadcasts 
also monday bush came under pressure from a coalition of 
conservative organizations and from americans for democratic 
action a liberal group to take a firmer stand in support of the 
demonstrators 
but former secretary of state henry a kissinger praised the 
administrations moderate approach and said a more meddlesome 
policy could backfire 
i dont think that any outsider can actually influence these 
things now kissinger said in china one always has to be very 
careful that the inherent nationalism and the sense of uniqueness 
of the chinese people doesnt turn against foreigners who are then 
accused of being imperialists

a coalition of civil rights religious 
womens and other activist groups opened a campaign tuesday 
designed to pressure president bush to sign a minimum wage increase 
he has promised to veto 
we believe that a veto of this desperately needed legislation 
would be a tragic step backward for millions of americas working 
people and their families said coretta scott king cochairwoman 
of the citizens committee for a just minimum wage 
by the stroke of a pen he could replace despair with hope in 
the lives of millions of our people said cochairman arthur 
flemming who was secretary of health education and welfare in the 
eisenhower administration 
the group including representatives of dozens of labor 
religious womens community and political organizations said the 
first salvo in its effort would be a 30second radio ad chastising 
bush for promising to veto the minimumwage bill at a time he is 
advocating tax breaks for the wealthy 
somethings wrong here a narrator says in the ad america 
should be a place where hard work pays off for everyone 
president bush dont deny working americans a chance to help 
themselves 
the rhetoric in the ad and by speakers at a news conference 
announcing the effort was sharp but the radio campaign itself is 
modest the coalition said it would spend 30000 to air the spot 
on 37 radio stations in 13 states and the district of columbia this 
week 
both chambers of congress have passed legislation raising the 
hourly minimum wage from 335 an hour to 455 by october 1991 
while allowing employers to pay some new workers a subminimum wage 
for up to two months the democratic leadership plans to send the 
bill to the white house after the senate returns from a weeklong 
recess bush has vowed to veto it he had offered to support an 
increase to 425 an hour provided all new employees could be paid 
a subminimum for six months 
bush appears to have the strength to sustain a veto meaning the 
impasse could result in a ninth year passing without an increase in 
the minimum wage which rose to 335 an hour in 1981 
for eight long years full time minimumwage earners have 
waited for their country to reaffirm that their work would be 
rewarded with a livable wage rabbi david saperstein of the 
religious action center for judaism reform said president bush 
would have them wait in vain 
members of the group said they were organizing a letterwriting 
telegram and telephone campaign designed to pressure bush and 
lawmakers whose support would be needed to override a veto 
the event was one of several planned by supporters of the 
measure in the coming weeks including mock signing ceremony likely 
to be held by democratic congressional leaders after the recess 
but bush and other administration officials have said the president 
will not be swayed in his first domesticpolicy showdown with 
congress

student activists tuesday turned over to police 
three young men whose zeal for the democracy movement led them to 
vandalize the famed portrait of mao tsetung that looks out over 
tiananmen square 
the three were hustled off by students occupying tiananmen 
square soon after they threw black and red paint on the nearly 
30foothigh portrait of communist chinas founding father 
the official xinhua news agency later identified them as a 
middle school teacher a newspaper arts editor and a factory 
worker all from southern hunan province maos birthplace all 
were in their 20s 
xinhua said they arrived in beijing on may 19 to participate in 
the student movement for democratic reforms 
splotches of paint were scattered on maos neck collar and one 
eyebrow and one long line of paint dripped down the side of his 
mouth and nose 
workers later covered the portrait with green canvas and 
tuesday evening a large crane appeared to hoist a new portrait into 
place over the gate to the forbidden city 
thousands of spectators many who had come to the square to see 
or support the student demonstrators stopped to watch the crowds 
cheered and clapped when the job was completed the old mao was 
driven off in a flatbed truck 
mao is regarded by most chinese as a flawed figure who caused 
great suffering with his purges of intellectuals the economic 
disaster of the great leap forward and the catastrophic 196676 
cultural revolution 
however he is still revered by chinese as the father of the 
nation 
some demonstrators in recent weeks have carried portraits of mao 
to show they preferred the high principles of a revolutionary such 
as mao to the corruption and selfinterest they believe is 
characteristic of many of todays leaders

less than half the federal seniorlevel 
managers and executives responding to a survey said they were sure 
they would go to work for the government again if they could 
retrace their careers 
and 71 percent said they felt their agency was experiencing a 
brain drain the departure of bright people for better 
opportunities they pointed to federal pay and benefits that have 
failed to keep pace with nongovernment work to better jobs 
outside government and to a negative public image of federal 
employees 
those who said they would not work for the government if they 
were starting out again cited those same factors plus the quality 
of their leaders and the degree of bureaucractic control over their 
jobs 
the survey made public tuesday was conducted by the alumni 
association of the federal executive institute which offers a 
fourweek training course for senior people in government 
questionnaires mailed to 2231 members last october drew 
responses from 1937 80 percent of them still with the government 
fortysix percent of those who responded said they would choose 
government work again while 24 percent would not and 28 percent 
were unsure the remaining 2 percent did not answer that question 
consistent with that result 48 percent said they would not 
encourage young people to have a federal career while only 41 
percent would encourage them 
those who said they would chose government jobs if they had to 
do it over again cited the challenging nature of the work their 
commitment to public service personal satisfaction the chance of 
professional growth or advancement the ability to have an 
influence on public affairs the pay and benefits the degree of 
management authority they exercise and job security 
even though less than half said they would do it again far more 
69 percent expressed satisfaction with their jobs only 15 
percent expressed disatisfaction 
fiftyfour percent said they think the quality of newly employed 
government people is lower than it was 10 years ago

some of the vegetation in the contaminated zone 
around the chernobyl nuclear power plant is growing to giant size 
a newspaper reported tuesday 
some plants are exhibiting giantism according to the 
newspaper lenins banner including giant green pines near 
woods that were left withered after the ukranian plants explosion 
and fire in 1986 that spewed radiation into the air 
some tree branches and leaves are abnormally formed and stamens 
tend to split the newspaper said 
tree buds have turned into leaves in seasons when they should 
lie dormant it said 
the article denied rumors that rodents are proliferating within 
a 18mile radius around the stricken plant or that nothing has been 
left alive in the area 
although there have been some genetic deviations noted in 
rodents in the zone no noticable changes in their condition or 
behavior has appeared the newspaper said 
but it said the areas population of elk and wild boar seems to 
have dropped 
the chernobyl disaster the worst accident known to have 
occurred at a nuclear power plant left at least 31 people dead and 
forced the evacuation of more than 100000 people

the bush administration on tuesday warmly 
praised a tax credit that encourages development of housing for 
lowincome americans but said it opposes renewal of the law because 
of budget problems 
the housing credit can be an effective tool to achieve our 
common objectives of providing decent safe and affordable housing 
for lowincome families and to build bridges toward home 
ownership housing secretary jack kemp told the house ways and 
means revenue subcommittee 
nevertheless he said the presidents budget does not favor 
the extension of the lowincome tax credit at this time 
john g wilkins acting assistant secretary of the treasury 
said that although the administration supports the objectives of 
the lowincome housing credit we must carefully weigh competing 
needs and existing programs in light of the budget deficit 
the administrations budget includes substantial direct 
expenditures for lowincome housing wilkins said 
the credit which provides a subsidy for construction or 
rehabilitation of housing rented to lowincome families is due to 
expire at yearend a state or local agency is permitted to 
allocate credit authority of 125 per resident the credit is 
expected to cost about 325 million this year 
kemp noted that demand for the credit continues to grow 
preliminary figures for all states except alaska indicate 68 
percent of the allocation was used in 1988 and about 93 percent use 
is forecast this year figures from state officials show the credit 
was used last year to benefit more than 85000 lowincome housing 
units 
bills to improve targeting of the credit have been introduced in 
both houses of congress and kemp said those proposals appear to 
have made a major step toward resolving the shortcomings of the 
current taxcredit program 
i pledge my cooperation in working with congress toward the 
enactment of a bill which efficiently directs the benefits of the 
programs to those who are most in need of assistance and which 
promotes the goal of increased housing opportunity kemp said

donald e lukens admitted having sex with 
an underage girl in november a prosecutor charged today as the 
congressmans trial opened 
assistant prosecutor rita mangini said in opening arguments that 
the 58yearold republican at first denied the accusations but 
later admitted he had sexual contact with a 16yearold at his 
columbus apartment 
ms mangini told the jury that the teenager went to lukens 
apartment at the invitation of another girl and that lukens not 
only paid their cab fare but also gave them money after having sex 
with the 16yearold 
defense attorney thomas tyack said the congressman does not deny 
that two girls came to his home on the night of nov 6 but the 
lawyer cautioned that what happened inside the apartment is a 
matter of dispute 
lukens who is divorced is charged with contributing to the 
delinquency or unruliness of a minor 
he has denied the allegation contending the girls mother tried 
to extort money from him if convicted he could receive up to six 
months in jail and a 1000 fine 
the congressman sat quietly and showed no emotion during opening 
statements 
lukens was indicted after a secretly videotaped meeting with the 
girls mother the tape made by a tv station showed him 
apparently offering the woman a government job after she asked why 
he was messing around with her daughter lukens also said he 
did not realize the girl was underage 
following opening statements today the girls mother anna 
coffman testified that she contacted the congressman in november 
after she overheard her daughter and the other girl discussing 
their visit with lukens 
mrs coffman said she told lukens her daughter was 16 and that 
he asked to meet with her at a fastfood restaurant 
i wanted to get him exposed for what he had did mrs 
coffman said she said she felt she would get no help from the 
police and contacted tv station wsyx agreeing to wear a concealed 
microphone and be videotaped 
domestic relations judge ronald solove on monday took under 
advisement two motions by ms mangini who asked that only limited 
testimony be allowed from the girl regarding two other cases in 
which she is a witness ms mangini also asked that the girls 
juvenile record not be introduced as evidence 
tyack opposed both motions saying the evidence would be needed 
to determine the girls credibility 
the columbus dispatch reported today that franklin county 
sheriffs records indicate the girl was apprehended in 1986 in a 
getaway car used in a robbery and that she told detectives she had 
supplied a gun to the robber

a committee of prominent black scholars called 
tuesday for smaller more personal schools significant parental 
involvement and other steps they said would help black children 
achieve greater academic success 
we believe it is the schools responsibility to overcome 
social barriers that limit academic progress said sara lawrence 
lightfoot a harvard university education professor and member of 
the committee on policy for racial justice 
what we demand is this that the schools shift their focus 
from the supposed deficiencies of the black child and the alleged 
inadequacies of black family life to the elimination of the 
barriers that stand in the way of academic success lightfoot 
said 
she spoke at a news conference to release the committees 
publication visions of a better way a black appraisal of public 
schooling 
such a shift is essential if the united states is to have the 
highly trained and educated work force it needs in the near future 
the publication said 
all of our fates all of our skins are wrapped up in better 
education for black students lightfoot said unlike in earlier 
times she said people have to stay in school to become 
functioning members of the work force 
the publication cites barriers to black academic achievement 
among them deeprooted social and economic inequities mistaken 
notions and stereotypes about lowerincome people misuse of 
standardized testing and rigid tracking systems 
lightfoot the lead author said the most important way to 
improve education for black children is to make schools more human 
and personal she said schools should be smaller or large schools 
should be divided into schoolswithinschools to combat the 
invisibility that minority students often feel 
parents must be at the heart of the effort she said playing 
significant roles in decisions ranging from curriculum to 
disciplinary techniques 
lightfoot said the committee does not recommend abolishing 
standardized testing or tracking systems that often put black 
children on vocational rather than academic paths at very early 
ages 
but she said tests should never be used as the sole measure of a 
students achievements or intelligence and children should be 
reevaluated frequently so that they arent permanently consigned 
to a single box or category or track 
the whole system needs to be made much more subtle much more 
flexible much more discerning she said 
the essay calls on the black community to make improving the 
public schools its principal objective in the next decade it says 
the black middle class and black institutions such as churches and 
fraternal organizations have a special responsibility to set 
expectations and support academic development among black youth 
roger wilkins a history professor at george mason university in 
fairfax va said black institutions are trying to meet the new 
needs confronting them were trying to encourage more 
institutions to adapt more rapidly he said 
but wilkins added that we are not at all saying that our 
community alone can combat the street culture we are not here 
to let the larger community off the hook when it comes to dealing 
with drugs crime job opportunities medical care and other needs 
the committee recommends expanded funding for head start and 
chapter 1 the federal governments major programs for atrisk and 
disadvantaged students it also suggests closer ties between 
schools and social services recruitment of more black teachers and 
an expanded curriculum that recognizes the realities of black 
childrens lives

a burglary suspect eluded police for months 
then was released two days after his capture under a federal court 
order aimed at reducing jail overcrowding 
its very frustrating said police lt james dickerson we 
spend money and time looking for people and then theyre right back 
out 
frank washington 32 of pittsburgh had been sought by city 
police since january in a series of burglaries 
detectives arrested him may 15 after tracking him to a bar and 
he was released from allegheny county jail two days later because 
of overcrowding washington did not have to post his 20000 bond 
police cmdr ronald freeman complained that the court order on 
jail population issued by us district judge maurice cohill 
allows criminals to return to the streets 
i certainly believe judge cohill has contributed greatly to 
our crime statistics freeman said 
the judge consistently refuses to comment on the issue 
warden charles kozakiewicz said he had no choice but to free 
washington under the judges order he was among the prisoners 
with the lowest bonds and was not accused of any of 14 serious 
crimes that warrant keeping inmates in jail despite their bonds 
its distasteful to me and certainly not to my liking to 
release anybody from jail he said

eric lillies parachute opened perfectly 
after he jumped off a construction crane on an 18story office 
building early tuesday but his landing was rough two police 
officers were waiting for him 
the officers were just passing by when they saw this guy jump 
off the building said sgt jeff hanson the only question was 
whether he was wearing a parachute 
the officers cited the 23yearold santa monica man for 
trespassing then went back to the station to go over the books to 
see if lillie broke any other laws 
it looks like trespassing is it said hanson we found 
something about parachuting and hang gliding and that in the city 
but its only for city parks not office buildings

stung by sharp criticism from fellow 
scientists chemists stanley pons and martin fleischmann shun 
friend and foe alike these days to concentrate on a new round of 
coldfusion experiments 
the pair have ignored an invitation to defend their work at a 
conference sponsored by the los alamos national laboratory that 
opened today in santa fe nm 
they also turned down a meeting with the state panel that will 
allocate a 5 million appropriation for fusion research at the 
university of utah 
pons and fleischmann hope that two papers they are preparing for 
submission to scientific journals will flesh out the sketchy data 
they have provided so far said james brophy the universitys vice 
president for research 
they feel their time is more valuably spent in the lab getting 
some of the details people have criticized them for not having 
said brophy who planned to attend the sessions in santa fe 
pons and fleischmann sent physicists around the world scurrying 
to their laboratories when they announced in a march 23 news 
conference they had sustained fusion in a bottle by running an 
electrical current between platinum and palladium electrodes 
immersed in heavy water containing deuterium a variety of 
hydrogen 
but at subsequent scientific gatherings pons and fleischmann 
were accused of shoddy research and criticized for not publishing 
enough information to enable others to duplicate their results 
scores of scientists have attempted to reproduce their 
experiment but few researchers have matched their results 
the workshop on cold fusion phenomena sponsored by los alamos 
national laboratory could begin to clarify the many conflicting 
claims and counterclaims still pouring out of university national 
and private laboratories 
in abstracts of papers scheduled to be presented this week 
researchers largely dismissed the sensational claims of pons and 
fleischmann who works with pons but is affiliated with the 
university of southampton england 
however many of the presenters from los alamos to new jersey 
suggest enough lowlevel fusion is occurring to justify more 
research into the territory 
today texas aampm university physicists john appleby and kevin 
wolf offered qualified support for the chemists claims at the 
santa fe conference 
appleby said he found evidence of anomalous heat wolf said 
separate tests turned up evidence that a small number of neutrons 
and larger amounts of tritium had been released in experiments 
similar to pons and fleischmanns 
wolf said the number of neutrons produced was up to seven times 
the number expected in nature convincing he asked 
rhetorically you be the judge 
about 500 physicists chemists and other scientists from around 
the world were expected at the conference 
in stockholm swedish physicists said today they produced a 
burst of neutron radiation in an experiment similar to the those 
conducted by the utah chemists 
the results indicate fusion reactions can occur at low 
temperatures in the electrode material palladium this gives 
certain support to fleischmann and pons ideas said scientists at 
the manne siegbahn institute for physics 
in an interview this week pons said his research was going 
fantastic of the critics he said people are going to have to 
eat a lot of crow id say 
originally pons and fleischmann cited patent concerns for their 
refusal to share specifics of their research but six pending 
patents now protect the basic experiment and lack of time is the 
only thing preventing the chemists from producing more detailed 
accounts brophy said 
brophy said the new papers will include far more information 
than the first ponsfleischmann article published by the journal 
of electroanalytical chemistry including details on heat 
measurements 
he said the pair now believe their experiment produces 100 times 
more energy in the form of heat than it burns originally they 
claimed a fourtoone ratio 
the chemists contend that laboratories such as massachusetts 
institute of technology yale and others have failed to reproduce 
their results because they have not set up the experiments properly 
if that is true they should provide more information said 
steven koonin a california institute of technology physicist 
im not a patent lawyer but i dont see why they are holding 
back the fact that they are makes me very suspicious said 
koonin if theyre worried about patenting and processes i would 
think thats all locked up if theres something there theyll get 
the credit

front door 
she said she fled across the street to divine savior hospital 
her husband found refuge in the bathroom while the bear made its 
visit that lasted only about 10 to 15 seconds 
the bear apparently wasnt searching for food 
everything i left on the counter was there when it was all 
over apparently a shrimp salad didnt tempt him in the least 
bit she said 
police officer tom moore said the department had received a call 
of a bear in the griffins neighborhood he said he and a colleague 
chased the bear from the griffin home to the bottomland of the

us and other foreign television networks 
competed for satellite time tuesday after chinese authorities 
lifted a martial law ban on transmitting 
the major us networks japanese tv stations and two hong kong 
stations rushed to transmit their videotape after china central 
television announced that satellite services had been resumed 
it was a zoo there was only one path out said john 
sheahan cbs bureau chief in beijing 
cctv was ordered not to allow further television transmissions 
and the military dismantled satellite earth stations after the 
government declared martial law in beijing on saturday to put down 
growing studentled unrest 
after martial law was declared chinese authorities shut down 
the satellite transmissions of cbs and cable news networks which 
had been broadcasting live from beijing during the sinosoviet 
summit but continued their reports after the highlevel meeting was 
over to show the student demonstrations the chinese authorities 
said the networks had permission only to broadcast live while 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was in china 
despite arguments from cbs and cnn the government pulled the 
plug on the networks the satellite shutdown forced cbs cnn and 
the other us networks to carry their videotape to other 
countries where it was transmitted back to the united states 
on tuesday however sheahan said he was told that one earth 
station was restored and cctv received a call from military 
authorities at 5 pm 4 am edt informing the staterun station 
that it could decide on its own whether to provide transmitting 
facilities 
thirty minutes later cbs was notified the satellite service was 
restored 
all videotape had to be transmitted by way of london with the 
various networks taking turns sending in five and 10minute blocks 
it was like going through a subway turnstile sheahan said 
there was an enormous amount of good will among competitors 
cctvs decision to resume satellite transmissions came amid 
martial law regulations that banned nearly all reporting activities 
by foreign reporters in beijing 
despite the ban there has been little government interference 
in foreign coverage of the demonstrations

orders for big ticket durable goods surged 
29 percent in april the biggest advance since december the 
government said tuesday in a report that further eased fears of a 
recession this year 
the commerce department said orders for manufactured goods 
expected to last three years or more rose to a seasonally adjusted 
1291 billion last month after a 1 percent increase in march 
those gains followed declines in january and february that had 
raised concerns economic growth might be in danger of slowing so 
much that the country could topple into a recession brought on by a 
credit squeeze engineered by the federal reserve board 
but analysts said the backtoback gains of the last two months 
were a good indication that demand in the manufacturing sector will 
be enough to keep the economy expanding this year although at a 
slower pace than 1988 
david wyss an analyst with data resources inc said that while 
he still believed economic growth was slowing the 
biggerthanexpected increase in orders in april showed the economy 
is not softening quite as fast as a lot of people thought 
priscilla trumble an economist for the wefa group of bala 
cynwyd pa said she believed the central bank was successfully 
engineering a soft landing in which economic growth slows 
enough to dampen inflation but not enough to cause a slump 
the april durable goods report she said does in fact make 
me feel a little more comfortable that the bottom is not going 
to fall out this year 
the report added robert dederick chief economist at the 
northern trust co in chicago says that the manufacturing

former arms control negotiator paul warnke 
urged the bush administration tuesday to take advantage of soviet 
proposals and to ease pressure on nato to agree to modernize 
shortrange nuclear weapons in west germany 
the best reaction we could have would be one of restraint 
said warnke who was chief arms negotiator under president carter 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has announced a cut of 
500000 in the soviet armed forces including withdrawal of 50000 
troops and 5000 tanks from central europe and has offered to 
reduce the warsaw pact forces to levels below those of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
president bush has been cool to gorbachevs proposals and has 
asked nato leaders to approve at a meeting next week a plan to 
modernize the lance missile system in europe the plan envisions a 
tripling of the lance range to more than 200 miles and expanding 
the number of launchers from 88 to 997 
west germany has been pushing for talks on reducing shortrange 
nuclear forces in europe but bush has balked citing soviet 
superiority 
the soviet union has 1400 shortrange nuclear missiles in 
europe and according to nato figures has 6260 nuclear artillery 
systems compared with 2700 for the atlantic alliance 
warnke said gorbachevs proposals opened the way toward a very 
significant military standdown in europe 
it would be very difficult for us at this point to make a 
matching response that involved very significant reductions in 
american troops the net result of that would be to paralyze 
nato warnke told a news conference 
one sensible response would be to say in response to mr 
gorbachev ok if you are willing to eliminate the offensive 
invasion threat we do not have to decide to deploy new shortrange 
nuclear missiles the sole function of which would be to respond to 
that invasion 
warnke also denied administration assertions that the soviets 
have modernized their shortrange nuclear missile force noting 
that the newest such system the ss23 was required to be 
destroyed under the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed 
in 1987 most soviet shortrange missiles are scuds which were 
deployed 25 years ago he said 
warnke at his news conference presented a report by the 
british american security information council which largely 
reflected his views on disarmament

a growing number of companies intend to 
require their employees to pay a greater share of their health care 
costs in response to soaring medical expenses the chairman of the 
national association of manufacturers said tuesday 
richard e heckert in releasing a survey of the associations 
members on health insurance issues said increased costsharing is 
a positive development because it encourages workers to become 
more educated healthcare consumers 
the survey of 2029 manufacturers earlier this year found that 
the cost of providing health insurance represented an average 37 
percent of the companies net profits 
theyre looking for some way to cut their expenses heckert 
said 
the cost of health care for us businesses has tripled over the 
last eight years and rose an average 30 percent last year for the 
companies surveyed he said 
the survey found 84 percent of the manufacturers surveyed 
opposed any attempt to require companies to provide benefits to 
workers as a bill introduced in the senate by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass would do 
requiring coverage by employers would further escalate medical 
costs and it doesnt make sense to raise costs further in a 
system that needs major repair heckert said 
among the manufacturers surveyed 993 percent offer group 
health care benefits to employees and nearly all of them extend 
coverage to the families of their workers 
nearly 56 percent of those surveyed pay the entire cost of 
premiums for coverage and most of the rest share the cost with 
employees for dependent coverage nearly 32 percent pay the entire 
cost of coverage premiums while about 54 percent share the cost 
with the worker and nearly 15 percent require the worker to pay all 
of the cost of such coverage 
the manufacturers did not propose radical changes in the current 
healthcare system but suggested ways to reduce costs including 
reform of the medical liability system to limit damage awards and 
elimination of costly administrative burdens on employers offering 
health insurance to workers

a high school principal encouraged a student 
to recite the lords prayer as part of his commencement speech 
after a federal judge rejected a ministers request to lead the 
prayer the student says 
iowa civil liberties union officials criticized west monona high 
school principal gary niichel for his action 
it shows a complete lack of respect for our court system 
said mark lambert a legislative lobbyist for the iclu 
senior class president alan langenfeld recited the prayer sunday 
to about 1000 people langenfeld said he first consulted with his 
father and niichel 
i had a little prompting from my father and mr niichel he 
said 
i need to make a distinction here langenfeld added mr 
niichel has a son in our graduating class and any advice he gave he 
gave as the father of a graduating senior not as a principal 
niichel acknowledged monday that he knew of langenfelds plans 
minutes before the commencement he declined to comment further 
because of my position as an administrator 
us district judge donald e obrien last week rejected a 
request by the rev duane lundberg to lead a prayer at the 
graduation citing constitutional restrictions on religious 
practices at public facilities 
lambert said the iclu had not decided whether to pursue legal 
action in the case a secretary in obriens office said the judge 
was out of town and unavailable for comment tuesday 
school superintendent donald southwick said no action will be 
taken against langenfeld and said he was unsure whether the 
district will take steps to prevent similar incidents 
langenfeld said he polled classmates before the ceremony and no 
one objected to the prayer 
the whole class was kind of jittery he said they were 
joking around that the feds were going to come get us and wed have 
our diplomas to read while we were sitting in jail

one million people in beijing and tens of 
thousands in other cities marched tuesday to demand that premier li 
peng resign and there were signs he might be losing a power 
struggle with liberal factions of the leadership 
foreign minister qian qichen in the first official illumination 
on the backstage struggle since li declared martial law in parts of 
the capital saturday said communist party general secretary zhao 
ziyang remained in office 
zhao who heads a more liberal faction favored meeting with 
university students who occupied tiananmen square may 13 to demand 
a dialogue on democratic reforms he reportedly offered to resign 
shortly before li ordered troops in to quell the protest 
qians comment to european community ambassadors reported by 
diplomatic sources was the first official word on zhaos status 
in other indications li may be losing his power struggle with 
zhaos faction a military officer was quoted as saying troops 
ordered into beijing have been told to withdraw he did not say how 
far 
the official xinhua news agency also reported public demands for 
lis ouster for the first time in its report on tuesdays march in 
beijing the overwhelming majority of the slogans of the parade 
were directed against the chief leader of the state council 
xinhua said referring to li but not by name the state council is 
chinas cabinet 
hong kong commercial radio reported the party politburo decided 
to strip li of both his government and party posts and that zhao 
would resume his duties the report could not be confirmed and was 
one of many contradictory reports on chinas murky political 
situation 
however lis failure to enforce martial law four days after 
declaring it in a harsh speech broadcast nationwide seemed to 
indicate he lacked adequate support within the government and party 
also uncertain is the status of senior leader deng xiaoping 84 
believed to be behind the crackdown 
dear students your final goal is not far away a student 
announcer said over a loudspeaker to the 30000 students still 
occupying tiananmen square 
the protesters originally sought a dialogue with the government 
on press and other reforms but since martial law have demanded 
lis resignation 
outoftown students continued to flock to beijing to join the 
protest even though many of the original beijing strikers left the 
square in exhaustion after a weeklong hunger strike 
beijing residents continued to defy martial law regulations 
against marching making speeches distributing pamphlets and other 
political activities 
students teachers government workers and intellectuals led the 
biggest march since martial law was declared chanting li peng 
step down and withdraw the troops lift martial law 
xinhua put the number of marchers at 1 million and reported the 
chants against li in sharp contrast to other official reports of 
the past few days that have insisted order is being maintained in 
beijing and life is returning to normal 
some aspects of beijing life did become more normal tuesday 
with about half of the citys bus routes resuming service for the 
first time since saturday the subways also reopened and many 
people went to work although traffic broke down again during the 
afternoon march 
about 100000 people also marched tuesday in the southern city 
of canton and tens of thousands of students and workers marched in 
the eastcoast city of shanghai with about 200000 people watching 
shanghai students plastered posters calling for a strike all 
over the city but despite support from the workers for the 
students cause there was no indication that much heed was paid to 
the strike idea 
during the march in beijing three men in their 20s hurled black 
and red paint at the 30foothigh portrait of revolutionary leader 
mao tsetung that hangs in the square 
students hustled the three away and later turned them over to 
police the government removed the stained portrait with a crane 
and hung a similar one 
other embarrassments have been less easily eliminated the party 
newspaper the peoples daily said soldiers were greatly 
humiliated when their convoys were surrounded by residents since 
saturday to keep them from entering the city 
the paper quoted an unidentified colonel as saying that 
superiors had ordered the troops to withdraw many have pulled off 
the streets into military and compounds in recent days and it was 
not clear if the colonel meant they would withdraw further back to 
their home bases 
beijing tv news said one soldier was killed when his military 
vechicle was hit by another and he fell off it was the first 
confirmed death under martial law 
several soldiers students and residents were hurt monday night 
when the two sides pelted each other with stones and bricks at a 
miliary convoy in southwestern beijing that was immobilized by the 
civilians for three days

ten prison guards have filed a classaction 
lawsuit against the state charging prison overcrowding is so 
severe that guards are in danger 
inmates are not the only people affected by conditions that 
judges sometimes call cruel and inhuman punishment said thomas 
j brophy a spokesman for american federation of state county and 
municipal employees council 93 the union representing 3000 state 
prison guards 
numerous lawsuits have been filed by inmates seeking to reduce 
prison overcrowding but brophy and others said tuesday they 
believe this is the first legal action by guards 
as of may 17 there were 7145 inmates jammed into state prisons 
designed to hold 3824 department of correction spokesman deodato 
arruda said 
the lawsuit filed may 12 in suffolk superior court charges 
that inmates in the concord prison are shoehorned into the paint 
shop day rooms telephone rooms hospital ward and hallways 
the crowding has made some areas impossible to secure and led to 
an increase in inmate violence and attacks against guards the 
lawsuit alleges 
the 10 correctional officers all of whom are union officials 
charge the conditions violate their contract as well as state laws 
mandating a safe workplace they want the court to bar the state 
from locking up more prisoners than the jails were built to hold 
most often officers injuries are suffered when they are 
breaking up inmateoninmate violence brophy said neither 
brophy nor arruda could provide statistics on assaults against 
guards but brophy said they had increased 
state attorneys met tuesday to decide how to respond to the 
lawsuit arruda said 
massschusetts has embarked on a jailbuilding program with 225 
new prison beds to be completed at concord by october and 1185 
statewide by 1990 he said 
although several inmate lawsuits are pending on the crowding 
issue the state is not under court order to reduce prison 
overcrowding two county jails are under such orders and a 
courtappointed master has been granting early releases to convicts 
at the dedham jail

washington cathedral 82 years in the building 
and one of the glories of the capitals skyline moved a step 
nearer to completion tuesday as the last load of limestone was 
delivered for the second largest cathedral in the united states 
i thought once i wasnt going to be able to see it finished 
said otto epps the projects head laborer and a veteran of 37 
years of working on the cathedral 
this is a great day said the rt rev john t walker 
episcopal bishop of washington who said a prayer of thanksgiving 
at a raindampened ceremony on the steps of the cathedral 
its been a labor of love said peter cleland master mason 
who has worked on the project since 1953 by chance the final 
delivery from the bybee stone co of bloomington ind came on 
clelands 68th birthday which will be his last on the job 
clelands father william supervised the cathedral project 
before his son now two grandsons billy and ray work there too 
construction of the cathedral began in 1907 the first section 
bethlehem chapel was completed in 1912 the central tower was 
finished in 1964 and the nave was ready for the nations 
bicentennial in 1976 
known to tourists as national cathedral but properly named 
washington cathedral the church is operated by the protestant 
episcopal cathedral foundation 
that organization was created by congress in 1893 and began 
planning began for construction of the great church for national 
purposes that pierre lenfant had envisioned a century earlier as 
part of his plan for the capital city 
washington cathedral is the final resting place of woodrow 
wilson adm george dewey and helen keller it was the setting for 
the funeral of dwight d eisenhower in 1969 and for a national 
memorial service after harry s truman died in 1972 the rev 
martin luther king jr preached his last sunday sermon at the 
cathedral three days before he was murdered 
each year some 350000 people visit the cathedral second in 
size only to new yorks unfinished episcopal cathedral of st john 
the divine among american cathedrals and the worlds sixth largest 
the final ceremonial stone is to be set in place sept 29 1990 
83 years to the day from the laying of the foundation stone even 
then though work will go on 
weve got to clean up our front yard said dick feller 
canon clerk of the works or head of construction for the cathedral 
standing in a muddy work area outside the gothic 14th century 
catheral feller said there will still be five years of scaffolding 
to remove plus cleaning five years of mortar droppings from the 
stone 
besides there is still some art work to be done still a few 
stainedglass windows and some carving he said but with all 
the stones from tuesdays last shipment scheduled to be in place 
later this year feller added this finishes all the stonework 
the stones from the indiana company which has supplied the 
cathedral for about 10 years weight from 150 to 450 pounds all 
the limestone has come from indiana the first delivery was in 1910 
a cloudburst hit washington a few minutes before the ceremony 
began but had let up by the time the cheering crowd watched a giant 
crane lift the first stone off a truck 
after the ceremony at a cakeandcoffee birthday party for 
cleland in a construction shack anthony j segreti president of 
segreti tepper architects the washington firm overseeing the job 
said 
theres quite a difference working on this project and on a 
specification office building downtown this type of construction 
you dont see in this day and age 
indeed not 
apart from using a modern crane to get it up there this 
cathedral is really built in the mediaeval style stone on stone 
said the rev leonard freeman communications director at the 
cathedral 
a modern building you put up a steel frame and put things 
around it but thats not the way this was built this was built 
physically in the same manner that they were built in the middle 
ages 
is 83 years a long time to build a cathedral no said freeman 
its about middle range 
a shorty might take 50 or 60 years some of them go 150 years 
or more without having been finished

prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel dimissed 
as useless tuesday a key middle east policy speech by us 
secretary of state james a baker iii and said he will pursue an 
independent israeli peace plan 
shamir also told a news conference that britain and the united 
states accept in principle israels plan for elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
but a british foreign office official denied this saying there 
were clear differences during talks earlier tuesday between 
shamir and foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe shamir met monday 
with prime minister margaret thatcher 
concluding his threeday visit to britain the israeli leader 
flatly rejected almost all of bakers speech delivered monday in 
washington shamir insisted his government will not negotiate with 
the palestine liberation organization or trade land for peace 
i think it was useless he said of bakers call for israel 
to forswear the occupied territories stop jewish settlements there 
and hold serious political dialogue with the palestinians 
i dont think that all these issues on which we differ have 
anything to do with our proposed peace initiative he said 
the israeli proposal calls for palestinians in the occupied land 
to elect representatives to negotiate temporary selfrule with 
israel with talks to be held later on the final status of the 
territories israel seized after the 1967 sixday war 
shamir said mrs thatcher accepted in principle our peace 
initiative adding i think our peace initiative was accepted 
in principle by the us government 
however british officials echoed bakers noncommittal 
description of the plan as a useful step forward asked if mrs 
thatchers government accepted the israeli proposal a foreign 
office official speaking anonymously said there are clear 
differences 
britain like most west european countries supports an 
international peace conference on the middle east 
israeli radio reported howe pressed shamir to endorse the idea 
of yielding territory for peace but the israeli said he and his 
entire coalition government reject this 
shamir acknowledged at the news conference that howe raised the 
issue but said it should not be discussed now because the israeli 
initiative means all issues can be raised during the final 
negotiations 
in jerusalem israeli foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
called bakers call for land concessions explosive 
we cant say no to baker because if we say no we wont 
have a palestinian negotiating partner said liel we cant 
say yes because if we say yes we wont have a government 
shamirs current diplomatic offensive follows palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafats stated renunciation 
of terrorism and acceptance of israels right to exist 
they say they have renounced terrorism it is not true 
said shamir by sitting down with the plo we would legitimize 
their demand for a palestinian state and we dont want to give them 
this gift 
in washington meanwhile israeli defense minister yithak rabin 
concentrated on winning support for shamirs plans 
he told the proisraeli american israel public affairs committee 
that palestinians would derive substantial benefits from the 
selfgovernment contemplated by israel running all government 
functions except foreign affairs defense and meeting the 
requirements of israelis in the territories 
rabin said it would be a mistake to focus on major components of 
a final solution now because the gap between israel and the arabs 
is too wide 
to tackle it now would lead nowhere he said the goal 
should be to create hope of coexistence

a man who told police and two 
newspapers that he killed a man who tried to prevent him from 
committing suicide was ordered jailed tuesday pending his return to 
new hampshire to face murder charges 
i wish it had been me instead of him said richard papineau 
who has been in and out of mental hospitals since torching a 
buddhist shrine in the berkshire hills six years ago while on a 
weekend pass from a veterans administration hospital 
he and two other men said they set the fire to draw attention to 
a lack of treatment programs for vietnam veterans 
papineau was arrested late monday at northampton state hospital 
a psychiatric facility where he had been held for observation to 
determine if he could stand trial on charges of assaulting his wife 
and girlfriend 
papineau pleaded innocent tuesday in northampton district court 
to a warrant charging him with being a fugitive from justice in new 
hampshire 
cynthia white an assistant new hampshire attorney general said 
tuesday that authorities have obtained a warrant charging him with 
the murder of a man whose body was found monday in woods off a 
highway in winchester nh 
papineau 40 reportedly told the unionnews in springfield and 
the recorder in greenfield during interviews at the hospital that 
he shot and killed the man he identified the victim as a patient 
at the va hospital in northampton and alleged the killing occurred 
after the two men drove to new hampshire on april 24 the papers 
said 
when i went out there i was going to take myself out he 
said i still wish it had been me instead of him just like i 
wish it had been me instead of the guys in vietnam ive been 
living with them for 22 years now there is one more name on that 
list and i will live with them until i check out 
in vietnam papineau received the bronze star for carrying a 
wounded fellow marine to safety despite being wounded in the face 
and head when his unit was trapped on a hill in the ah shau valley 
on june 4 1967 within 12 hours 85 percent of his company was 
killed or wounded and papineau was found 18 days after the battle 
wandering aimlessly through the countryside his lawyer said in a 
1984 court session 
papineau who said he also told his story to police here said 
he had been distraught over a restraining order that kept him away 
from the greenfield apartment shared by his girlfriend and his 
former wife 
he said he stopped his car walked into the woods and pointed a 
38caliber revolver at his own head 
i had the barrel in my face i was sitting on a rock 
papineau said his alleged victim he said came up behind me and 
said im not going to let you do this and grabbed me i kind of 
freaked the gun went off and he went down 
the next thing i knew the gun was empty and i was just 
standing there papineau said 
he described the victim whom he said he had known a few days 
as just like me a loner 
his troubles here began new years eve 1983 when papineau said 
that he and two other va hospital patients torched the small 
buddhist temple in hawley veterans from across the country later 
helped the small tibetan congregation rebuild the temple 
all three men were placed on probation and ordered to continue 
treatment but papineau entered and left hospitals in several new 
england states until a judge threatened to jail him king said he 
had recently returned to western massachusetts said michael king 
director of the veterans outreach center in greenfield

secretary of commerce robert mosbacher will 
ask the state department to renegotiate a driftnet fishing 
agreement with japan which has been widely criticized by us 
fishing groups a national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
spokesman said today 
the secretary had indicated that he is not satisfied with the 
draft agreement and will ask the department of state to go back and 
renegotiate an agreement that will satisfy us said the 
spokesman brian gorman 
japan along with south korea and taiwan faces possible trade 
sanctions on fishery products exported to the united states if 
driftnet agreements have not been signed by june 29 
mosbacher has the authority to decide whether the agreements

act passed by congress in 1987 
lawmakers from alaska washington state and oregon have called

the west must head off any attempt by the soviets 
to reduce naval forces during superpower arms talks the editor of 
janes fighting ships said tuesday 
capt richard sharpe wrote in the introduction to the respected 
military guide that the wests whole defensive strategy rests on 
its naval strength 
sharpe also said that as the risk of superpower confrontation 
recedes regional instabilitse threatening the 
economic interests of industrialized nations and breeding 
ies could increainternational terrorism 
he said the health of the us navy in the next few years 
depends on its ability to attract and keep qualified recruits 
he also said indias goal of becoming a dominant regional 
maritime power is beginning to cause concern around the whole 
oceanic rim 
sharpe said there is no doubt a key soviet objective is to 
reduce western naval strength because of its traditional 
reluctance to throw anything away the soviet navy has thousands of 
tons of ancient ships and submarines that it could unilaterally 
scrap with little impact on overall effectiveness he said 
it is devoutly to be hoped that the west will not once again 
be wrongfooted in the propaganda battle and that listment rates running 
at the lowest level in five years 
much of the problem he said is because of the disparity 
between military and civilian pay rates 
sharpe said most regional naval growth in the last year has been 
in the indian ocean and in the china seas which has 12 of the 
worlds 15 maritime disputes 
indian naval strength has continued to grow and sharpe said 
there is little doubt that india intends to be the dominant 
regional maritime force from the suez to malacca 
however benign the stated intentions with its gigantic and 
growing population its close ties to the soviet union its nuclear 
research activity its building up of bases and its attention 
to build new strike attack aircraft carriers and modern submarines 
india is beginning to appear to nations on the oceanic rim as a 
potentially belligerent state

the government on tuesday urged a federal appeals 
court to uphold the bush administrations ban on imported assault 
rifles in a case that could affect 640000 of the weapons in the 
first quarter of this year alone 
we do not want the american public to suffer the 
consequences said mark stern of the justice departments civil 
division its for their safety 
but a lawyer for an alabama gun shop owner argued that the 
government had already issued permits and should release 1250 
semiautomatic rifles that were impounded at the birmingham ala 
airport by the us customs service 
the threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
based in atlanta sat in miami for an expedited hearing on whether 
to release the rifles to don wood owner of gun south inc in 
trussville ala the judges took the case under advisement after 
the onehour session 
on april 26 us district judge william acker jr had ruled 
that wood was entitled to delivery of steyr augsa austrianmade 
rifles which sell for 900 to 1000 each 
but the government appealed the decision and stern argued 
monday that the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms needs more 
time to reexamine the permits it gave gun south and other arms 
importers 
the courts decision could affect the fate of about 640000 
similar weapons already held up this year by the presidential ban 
instituted after a man with an assault rifle killed five children 
at a school in stockton calif 
woods attorney james c barton dismissed the confiscation of 
his clients rifles as hysteria against a weapon already approved 
by atf as a sports rifle 
stern has used the term assault weapon 95 times in the face 
of testimony of his own experts barton said this is a libel 
on my clients product and we now have congress using the same 
term in the assault weapon control act of 1989 
barton said the confiscation threatened his clients livelihood 
and gun souths 700 employees the company has a total of 4700 
imported semiautomatic rifles on order

a huge earthquake ruptured a stretch 
of seabed tuesday about 125 miles north of macquarie island midway 
between australia and antarctica officials reported 
kevin mccue senior research scientist at the australian 
seismological center said the quake occurred at 654 am edt and 
measured about 72 on the richter scale the us geological survey 
put the reading at 82 
alison clifton chief of the australian national antarctic 
research expeditions research station on macquarie said by 
telephone a fairly severe quake had struck and it was pretty 
noisy 
it was certainly sizable ms clifton said and rattled 
buildings but caused no damage she said the macquarie island base 
often had felt earthquakes but nothing as strong 
mccue said the quake was the biggest in that part of the 
undersea macquarie ridge since the 1920s and indicated a large 
movement at the junction of the australian and pacific plates 
he said a stretch of seabed from 30 to 60 miles long and up to 
two miles deep apparently had ruptured with one geological plate 
sliding over another on the same ridge that includes new zealand 
mccue said the quake was too far away to be felt in new zealand or 
australia 
undersea earthquakes sometimes result in tidal waves but mccue 
and ms clifton said there was no evidence one had occurred 
macquarie island about 850 miles southwest of christchurch new 
zealand is uninhabited except for the research station it is 
about 21 miles long and 2 miles wide and is a breeding ground for 
penguins albatrosses and fur seals 
according to the us geological survey the temblor was the 
strongest anywhere in the world this year the last comparable 
quake was one 81 on october 20 1986 in the kermadec islands in 
the pacific the agency said 
the openended richter scale is a gauge of the energy released 
by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a 
seisomograph 
each increase of one number as in magnitude 55 to 65 means 
the ground motion is 10 times greater a quake of 35 can cause 
slight damage in populated areas and one of 6 can cause severe 
damage in march 1964 an earthquake in alaska of 85 killed 114 
people

the scores of minorities on a test used to 
screen job applicants must be adjusted to assure that blacks and 
hispanics are given equal consideration with whites experts on a 
national research council committee said tuesday 
adjustments that boost the scores of minorities on the general 
aptitude test battery a widely used employment screening exam are 
necessary to make sure that blacks and hispanics are not 
disproportionately excluded from job referrals a council 
committee said 
with no score adjustments very low fractions of 
minoritygroup members will be referred for employment it said 
this could result in what the committee called a severe adverse 
impact on the employment opportunities of those demographic 
groups 
the study was conducted by the council at the request of the 
department of labor one element of the study was to analyze a plan 
to use the general aptitude test battery to screen applicants for 
all of the 12000 job categories in the us economy 
the test now used to screen job applicants for several hundred 
thousand jobs annually was first developed in the 1940s by the 
us employment service a division of the department of labor in 
recent times the uses has encouraged state employment offices to 
use the test to select applicants who are referred to employers to 
fill job vacancies 
as part of the test program the nrc committee said the labor 
department adopted a system to adjust upward the scores of minority 
applicants this policy has been challenged by the department of 
justice labor officials asked the council to examine the policy 
from a technical perspective 
the committee concluded that score adjustments are necessary to 
assure equal job opportunities for minorities 
in the absence of score adjustments minority applicants who 
could preform successfully on the job will be screened out of the 
referral group in greater proportions than are equivalent 
majoritygroup applicants the study said 
the committee said the gatb examinations were only of modest 
use in predicting how well a specific applicant would perform a 
specific job the study also called unfounded a labor 
department claim that universally applying the gatb would save 
employers 80 billion annually through an increase in job 
productivity 
gatb examinations have at least two flaws the council committee 
said the study said that there are limited forms of the test 
which means that advance copies could become available to 
applicants thus giving them an unfair advantage 
the second flaw is what the committee called speededness 
the study said that a test that must be completed within a short 
period of time can give distorted scores if applicants are coached 
to randomly select answers in the final minute of the allowed time 
gatb examinations test verbal numerical perceptual and 
psychomotor skills but the committee said that no test is 
available to give a precise prediction of how well a person will 
perform on a job 
the national research council is the principal operating agency 
of the national academy of sciences a private organization 
chartered by congress

president richard von weizsaecker 
west germanys eloquent and respected elder statesman was 
reelected to a second fiveyear term tuesday 
a special assembly of legislators and appointed electors that 
convenes once every five years reelected the 69yearold christian 
democrat with 881 votes of the 1022 cast or 862 percent 
weizsaecker was unopposed 
during his first term weizsaecker transformed the largely 
ceremonial office into an influential post 
weizsaecker won praise for his effort to bring fellow germans to 
terms with the holocaust in a 1985 address marking the 40th 
anniversary of the german capitulation in world war ii 
but weizsaecker also called for a fair assessment of the 
accomplishments of a nation built on the ruins of nazi germany 
the president planned another major address wednesday to mark 
the 40th anniversary of west germanys statehood 
these are serious responsibilities and i wish for us the 
strength to bear them successfully weizsaecker said in an 
acceptance speech 
parliament president rita suessmuth opened the convention in 
bonns sprawling beethoven hall with words of praise for 
weizsaecker the sixth man to serve as west german president since 
the nation was founded on may 24 1949 
each of the five political parties represented in the federal 
parliament may nominate a candidate for the presidency but for the 
first time in the nations history the vote was uncontested 
reflecting the respect weizsaecker has won across the political 
spectrum 
weizsaecker drew the endorsement of all but the leftleaning 
greens party which nonetheless decided not to run their own 
candidate 
in a recent nationwide poll weizsaecker drew an approval rating 
of more than 85 percent and the institute for opinion research 
determined that he is the public figure most often chosen as an 
appropriate example for young west germans

president najib on tuesday called for 
a ceasefire in afghanistans 11yearold civil war and a council 
to draft a new constitution and oversee elections 
in an emotional speech to parliament najib urged lawmakers to 
promote peace by contacting guerrilla commanders in their provinces 
during a twomonth recess 
make any contact with the opposition you want najib said 
you can choose your own forum give me one new proposal give me 
any new proposal to solve this problem and we will listen 
najib said he wanted a peace conference with moslem guerrillas 
fighting the communist government which took power in a 1978 coup 
the conference would set up a council to oversee a ceasefire 
and draft a new constitution he said it would then oversee 
general elections and the formation of a new government he said 
najib has said he would step down to end the war which has 
claimed more than 13 million lives and sent 5 million of the 15 
million prewar population fleeing to neighboring countries 
najibs latest peace overtures were directed toward the 
guerrilla field commanders operating inside afghanistan 
on sunday the president urged commanders to break with their 
exiled leaders in pakistan and iran in return he said they would 
receive full military rank within the afghan army would be allowed 
to keep their weapons and would have full autonomy in the regions 
they control 
najib named commanders he hoped would accept his offer 
including akmed shah masood ismail khan and abdul haq who are 
known for their struggle against the government and soviet troops 
the last of the red army soldiers left kabul on feb 15 ending a 
nineyear intervention 
but the latest offer was rejected flatly and quickly najib said 
the commanders have reacted negatively to positive proposals 
and i think they have made a major historical error he said 
you could have united the country but now you are dividing it 
najib blamed the guerrilla leaders based in peshawar pakistan 
for hindering efforts toward a negotiated settlement 
what do they know about bloodshed inside this country he 
said we want to stop the flames of war but they want to 
continue war they are saying take weapons take rockets and 
destroy our cities 
diplomats in kabul said they doubted commanders would accept a 
ceasefire before the end of the summer when most of the fighting 
occurs commanders seem content to see if an outright military 
victory is possible they said 
iranbased guerrilla leaders said they had rejected an 
invitation to visit moscow for peace talks according to the 
official islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
the offer from yuli vorontsov first deputy foreign minister of 
the soviet union was refused immediately said ali jan zahedi 
spokesman for the guerrilla coalition 
in pakistan the un high commission for refugees said an 
increasing number of refugees were returning to their warravaged 
homes in southern afghanistan in early may the flow of refugees 
rose from about 15 families a week to more than 100 daily the 
commission said 
sources said the return appeared influenced by lighter fighting 
in the south weariness of camp life and the desire to plant spring 
crops

the government denied on tuesday that soldiers 
were misusing tear gas in putting down palestinian riots in the 
occupied territories and rejected allegations that deaths resulted 
from exposure to the gas 
the denial came despite repeated charges by palestinians 
supported by international human rights groups that soldiers have 
violated army regulations by firing tear gas into confined spaces 
such as homes clinics and mosques 
the israeli justice ministry report on the gas was in response 
to a june 1988 study by amnesty international the londonbased 
human rights group 
after a thorough investigation of the subject i can state 
with full confidence that amnesty internationals allegations 
concerning deliberate misuse of tear gas by the israeli defense 
forces are completely unfounded said a letter to the group 
signed by israeli attorney general joseph harish 
the report described tear gas as an essential tool in the 
preservation of public order and said there was no medical 
evidence to support charges that the gas can cause death 
human rights groups including amnesty international contend 
excessive exposure to tear gas can be fatal to babies the elderly 
and people with chronic respiratory diseases 
the un relief and works agency which oversees aid programs 
for palestinian refugees says that in the first 17 months of the 
uprising more than 5080 palestinians were treated for tear gas 
inhalation in the west bank and gaza strip fortyfour deaths were 
attributed to the gas the figures show 
officials at the information center for human rights set up by 
liberal israelis to monitor activities in the occupied lands say 
they have reports of 70 to 73 people who died short periods after 
exposure to tear gas 
but a center official who asked not to be identified said it 
is medically difficult to pinpoint exposure to tear gas as a direct 
cause of death 
doctors in the occupied territories have blamed tear gas for 
scores of miscarriages especially when women are exposed during 
the first trimester of pregnancy 
it has been reported that tear gas containers have been 
deliberately thrown or fired by israeli soldiers into peoples 
homes health clincis schools and mosques even though they are 
meant only to be used outdoors the amnesty international study 
said the gas has sometimes been used at night as a punitive 
measure 
the group said it had received the names of 18 babies all under 
six months and 17 adults all over 50 who were reported to have 
died after tear gas exposure it cited seven specific cases in its 
report on the israeli armys tear gas use 
it noted that the handbook of the manufacturer of the cs gas 
generally used in israel federal laboratories inc of saltsburg 
pa warns that tear gas incorrectly used can cause serious injury 
and even death 
the justice ministrys report acknowledged no method of riot 
control is completely without risk 
as a result it said the army has sought to restrict the use 
of even this nonlethal substance to instances where failure to use 
it might result in more fatalities or injuries due to the continued 
street violence 
the report said israeli doctors were unable to confirm that tear 
gas was a factor in six cases of palestinian deaths raised by 
amnesty because families had removed the bodies from hospitals 
before autopsy many moslems reject autopsy on religious grounds 
the report said those with lung or heart diseases could develop 
lifethreatening clinical symptoms when exposed to tear gas 
but that deaths could not be linked to the gas without autopsies 
in the seventh case amnestys own report quoted an israeli 
autopsy as attributing the death to a heart attack in this case 
the justice ministry did not deal with the amnesty allegation that 
tear gas may have been a contributing factor 
the report also cited a study made by israels national 
institute of legal medicine as saying there are no confirmed 
reports of human deaths caused by cs tear gas in the medical 
literature

major advances in manufacturing technology are 
needed if the us computer industry is to maintain its lead in the 
face of stiffening competition from around the world computer 
executives and university specialists said tuesday 
we have the most creative engineers we have the finest 
computer science our problem is a single problem we cant 
manufacture worth a damn said gordon bell vice president of 
research and development at ardent computer corp sunnyvale calif 
gordon e moore board chairman of intel corp this countrys 
leading manufacturer of computer microprocessors said he hopes 
us companies will respond to a recent call by the semiconductor 
industry association to reenter the world market for computer 
memory chips 
japan now controls 90 percent of the market for dynamic 
randomaccess memory chips known as drams 
moore said such an effort to resuscitate us production of 
drams probably would have to be a joint undertaking im hopeful 
we can find 10 companies who are each willing to put up 50 
million to 70 million in capital he said 
bell and moore were among speakers at a colloquium sponsored by 
the national research council the principal operating agency of 
the national academies of sciences and engineering 
robert w lucky executive director of the communications 
sciences research division at atampt bell laboratories noted that in 
1988 us companies controlled 57 percent of the 120 billion world 
computer market while the japanese had a 41 percent share 
however the united states had a very small share in the 
manufacturing of many computer components including 1 percent of 
drams and 3 percent of liquid crystal displays 
patrick a toole senior vice president and general manager of 
technology products for ibm corp said there was a need for much 
improved manufacturing prowess in the us computer industry 
building on the example of sematech an american consortium for 
research and development of semiconductors together we must find 
ways to charter new consortia particularly in manufacturing 
toole said 
charles h ferguson a research associate with the center for 
technology policy and industrial development at the massachusetts 
institute of technology said that to a very great degree the 
united states arena functions as a kind of public service 
organization for the rest of the world computer industry 
united states firms do a lot of the innovation but do not 
capture the market when the transition is made to mass 
production he said 
ferguson called for steps by the federal government including 
making the research and development tax credit permanent and other 
tax law changes to help reduce the cost of capital for us 
companies 
also he said there was a need for an increase in the level of 
technical and strategic cooperation among american computer firms 
as well as the development of a nationwide fiber optic network for 
computer communications 
to do these things effectively is going to require a 
fundamental break with the way the us government does things and 
the way the private sector does things ferguson said

rain has improved soil moisture conditions in 
the central and southern great plains and has slowed field work in 
the eastern corn belt and the delta region a government report 
said tuesday 
despite the rainfall in parts of the plains the outlook for 
winter wheat in much of the region continues to be poor harvest is 
under way in several states including texas and oklahoma 
nationally corn planting was 84 percent complete by the end of 
the may 1521 survey week lagging the normal pace by only two 
percentage points said the joint agricultural weather facility 
however in the wetter areas of the eastern corn belt planting of 
the new crop lagged far behind 
planting was complete in texas and nearly complete in georgia 
illinois iowa kansas missouri and nebraska the report said 
but in ohio where 85 percent of the corn acreage is usually 
planted by now only 24 percent was seeded the report said in 
pennsylvania 19 percent of the corn was planted by may 21 
compared with 62 percent usually 
the facility which is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments said the 1989 soybean crop was about 39 percent 
planted only two percentage points behind the normal pace 
however plantings lagged sharply in some areas including ohio 
where only 6 percent of the estimated soybean acreage had been 
planted compared with a normal 56 percent 
cotton plantings at 60 percent were reported nine points 
behind the usual rate for this time of the season although 
planting was complete in california it lagged in the delta and 
southeast 
a related report by the usdas 1989 drought task force headed by 
undersecretary richard crowder said that timely rains in the corn 
belt are promoting rapid germination and establishment of this 
years crop 
but the report added that the impact of recent rain in winter 
wheat areas will depend in part on weather conditions in the 
coming days 
if another weather front brings more rain as predicted 
moderate improvement in crop conditions could occur the task 
force said 
the national weather service calls for moderate to heavy rain 
in the great plains and corn belt in the next 5 to 10 days it 
added the outlook through midjune still calls for cool wet 
weather in the south and east and warm dry weather from the 
eastern dakotas into the central corn belt 
a new 30 and 90day weather outlook is scheduled to be issued 
by the weather service next week

a woman who lost track of time while 
living 130 days alone in a sealed cave with no human contact 
climbed out today waved to a crowd of about 60 people and said 
wow man 
stefania follini poked her head out of the entrance to the cave 
and put sunglasses on over her regular glasses to reduce the glare 
of the bright midday sun the temperature was 97 degrees a big 
difference from the caves constant 74 degrees 
the 27yearold italian interior decorator volunteered for the 
isolation experiment which began jan 13 in an effort to learn how 
people may be affected by the long solitude of inerplanetary travel 
she apparently learned some english during her isolation and 
told the crowd i feel great 
miss follini who had taken english primers into the cave with 
her to study the language nodded when asked if she would do it 
again and said sure 
researchers spoke with miss follini on monday to announce the 
end of the experiment first through messages typed on computers 
and then by intercome 
are you really serious she replied through the computer 
linking her to a house trailer above the cave 
miss follini 27 will be poked with needles and tagged with 
electrodes in coming weeks while scientists try to figure out what 
happened to her body and mind during the four months 10 days she 
spent 30 feet underground 
in the absence of night day or timepieces miss follinis 
menstrual cycle stopped and her sleepwake cycle changed radically 
she tended to stay up 20 to 25 hours at a time sleeping about 10 
hours 
researchers believe her muscle tone and the level of calcium in 
her bones decreased that her immune system is depressed and that 
she is able to concentrate more deeply 
miss follini kept up strength and flexibility during her 
molelike existence by doing calisthenics and judo and maintained 
her mental poise by reading and decorating her 10squarefoot 
plasticenclosed living area 
without the sun and other people time passed quickly for miss 
follini she believed that two months had passed instead of four 
and was shocked when experiment coordinator maurizio montalbini 
notified her by computer that the experiment was almost over 
montalbini assured her he was serious then wrote we will not 
ask you for any more data she had been asked to perform physical 
and mental tests periodically 
then while journalists watched her on a television monitor 
miss follini heard a human voice other than her own it was from 
the man upstairs 
stefania i am your god talking to you montalbini said 
over an intercom 
she looked at a camera laughed and said i didnt think you 
would find me down here 
miss follini spoke briefly with the other italian researchers 
then remarked that when she heard montalbinis voice for the first 
time the feeling she had was like when the alarm clock goes off 
on monday morning interpreter rita fraschini said 
after a brief respite life as a guinea pig will resume for miss 
follini 
on memorial day she has a date with university of texas medical 
school researchers in houston for electroencephalogram brain scans 
and performance tests said dr jon defrance an assistant 
professor at the medical school 
defrances team will attach electrodes to her head while she 
performs computerized tests of mental acuity and concentration 
they did similar tests while miss follini was in the cave but in 
houston researchers will be able to watch how specific parts of her 
brain function while shes solving problems researchers will 
perform the same tests again in six months 
other scientists will draw blood and inspect her in other ways 
to monitor her immune system bones muscles and coordination 
i hope with this research to find a way to prepare people 
going in space or submarines montalbini said

a virginia congressman objecting that a 
washington woman has been jailed 21 months in a child custody case 
pressed a house committee tuesday to limit civil contemptofcourt 
jailings in the district of columbia 
rep frank wolfs bill is designed to apply retroactively to the 
case of elizabeth morgan a plastic surgeon who was jailed when she 
refused to produce her daughter hilary to go on unsupervised visits 
with her exhusband oral surgeon eric foretich authorities have 
been unable to find the girl 
dc superior court judge herbert dixon held morgan in civil 
contempt of court and has said she will remain in jail until she 
relents 
morgan who had been granted custody of the sixyearold girl 
alleged that foretich the girls father had sexually abused the 
child on previous unsupervised weekend visits foretich has denied 
that 
wolfs bill affecting only the district of columbia where the 
federal government retains substantial control would change civil 
contempt charges to criminal contempt after 18 months that would 
guarantee morgan or others the filing of formal charges and a 
criminal jury trial 
what you actually have is civil contempt that is treated more 
harshly than criminal contempt wolf said i think a jury trial 
is a right and it would make a tremendous difference 
wolf a republican who represents a district just across the 
potomac river from washington criticized the current standoff and 
said i believe that a child who is denied the care of either 
parent is not being well served 
however foretich who attended the hearing but did not testify 
blasted the bill 
not one witness has expressed one scintilla of concern for 
hilary he said there are absolutely no guarantees that my 
daughter will be returned if her mother is freed 
foretich who has suggested that an independent panel of experts 
evaluate hilary her mother and himself said he would abide by any 
custody decision that a group of judges social workers and 
psychiatrists might propose 
if they conclude that it is in the best interests of my 
daughter for one of us to bow out i would foretich said i 
want what is best for her 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif chairman of the judiciary 
committees district of columbia subcommittee said he may schedule 
additional hearings on the bill before scheduling a vote on it 
the city council has no authority over the citys court system 
however council member james nathanson told the house panel that 
he opposed setting a time limit for contempt jailings 
if you put a cap on the courts authority some people will 
decide theyre willing to pay that price nathanson said i 
think that a court would be rendered less effective 
instead nathanson suggested establishing a threejudge panel to 
review all civil contempt cases extending past 12 months under 
nathansons plan the group which would include the judge who 
initially jailed the person would have to vote unanimously in 
favor of further incarceration in order to keep the person in 
prison

leaders of the house agriculture committee 
agreed tuesday to push through a broad package of federal 
assistance this week for farmers suffering crop losses from 
continuing drought 
the full committee under an agreement worked out by democrats 
and republicans will act on the legislation thursday the 
droughtrelief package will be brought before the house at an 
undetermined date after lawmakers return from a memorial day recess 
i think the chances that a bill will be passed and signed into 
law by the president have dramatically improved rep pat 
roberts rkan said after the meeting of committee leaders 
including the panel chairman rep kika de la garza dtexas 
the assistance package will mirror relief programs enacted by 
congress last year to aid producers in the midwest and northern 
great plains 
in general federal payments would be made to farmers who suffer 
losses of more than 35 percent of their crops 
the relief would be available for all crops not just specific 
hardhit ones like wheat because of damage from drought freezing 
temperatures hail and excessive moisture said scott swenson a 
spokesman for rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the 
agriculture subcomittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains 
lawmakers are considering another drought package this year 
because the agriculture department has said the 1989 winter wheat 
crop doesnt qualify for any of the 39 billion in assistance 
approved in 1988 
last week a bipartisan group of senators introduced 
droughtrelief legislation that would extend last years assistance 
programs to the winter wheat crop 
roberts said that house committee leaders decided to go with a 
generic bill as a way of broadening support as well as ensuring 
that adequate aid is available to springplanted crops if the 
drought worsens or spreads to other regions 
last years dry weather has persisted in some areas with winter 
wheat states like kansas oklahoma and texas particularly hard hit 
the agriculture department estimated this month that 
droughtrelated damage will cut this years expected crop of winter 
wheat to 143 billion bushels the lowest since 1978

the american council on education and the ford 
foundation on tuesday announced an 18month project to encourage 
community and junior college students to transfer to fouryear 
institutions 
a major thrust of the project is to boost the number of minority 
and lowincome students moving to fouryear colleges and 
universities the sponsors said nearly half the nations 2 million 
minority college students attend twoyear institutions 
there are about 1250 twoyear community and junior colleges in 
the country said project director judith eaton president of the 
community college of philadelphia 
she said the transfer rate to fouryear colleges is estimated at 
between 6 percent and 20 percent though surveys have found that 70 
percent or more of students at the twoyear institutions say when 
asked that they want to go on to earn a bachelors degree 
the first part of the 12 million project due to start in 
september will pair 25 twoyear institutions with fouryear 
colleges and universities the partner schools will collaborate on 
projects such as redesigning courses to make credits transferable 
developing faculty exchange programs and creating pilot programs 
for twoyear students with potential to transfer 
often what passes for collaboration is simply a paper 
agreement said alison bernstein of the ford foundation 
students are always in danger of losing time and losing credit 
and taxpayers are in danger of losing money because two and 
fouryear colleges havent come to an agreement 
eaton and bernstein said at a news conference that community 
colleges grew on a wave of interest in career education in the 
1970s when enrollment leveled off in the 1980s they said 
questions arose as to their effectiveness particularly with regard 
to minority and lowincome students 
we became so obsessed with access issues that we lost sight of 
retention and graduation issues said robert atwell president of 
the ace an umbrella group for 1700 educational institutions and 
associations the ford foundation is a private philanthropic group 
that sponsors reasearch 
other phases of the aceford project scheduled to follow the 
partnership experiments involve finding ways to encourage 
transfers through federal policy and holding regional meetings to 
discuss how different types of colleges and universities can 
encourage transfers of minority and lowincome students

wan li the head of the chinese peoples 
congress cut short his american visit after meeting with president 
bush on tuesday and us officials said they expected him to 
return to beijing to press for the ouster of hardline premier li 
peng 
one senior official speaking on condition he not be identified 
said the administration expects wan to call a meeting of the 
peoples congress shortly after his return the body which acts as 
chinas legislature is sometimes considered a rubberstamp 
organization but it does have the authority to impose or revoke 
martial law the official said 
he said wan was expected to urge the peoples conress to reject 
the use of military force against prodemocracy demonstrators who 
have continued their protest after a government declaration of 
martial law and to press the body to formally oust li 
bush in his meeting with wan repeated his call for 
nonviolence and asked wan to end the jamming of voice of america 
according to a white house statement 
demonstrators in beijing had been relying heavily on voa 
broadcasts to keep informed during the five weeks of prodemocracy 
protests the jamming which began monday was the first by china 
of voa transmissions since before diplomatic relations with the 
united states were restored in 1979 
the white house statement quoted bush as telling wan that we 
are strongly committed to democracy around the world it is the 
underpinning of our being as a nation i urge nonviolence and 
restraint in your present situation i urge that voice of america 
not be jammed and that reporters be given open access 
if extensive force were used to break up the demonstrations 
said the us official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
that could put uschinese relations in question and endanger the 
broadbased economic ties that have been built up over the past 
years of good relations the official said 
he pointed to the fact that the united states has had no 
official contact with chinese authorities in china for nearly 
two days as evidence of continued highlevel turmoil adding that 
the chinese appear to have shut down all contact with foreign 
governments 
wan had been expected to remain in the united states several 
more days but state department officials were informed he was 
returning late tuesday 
the chinese embassy said that wans visit for health reasons 
will end earlier than scheduled and that he his wife and 
delegation were returning home visits to florida and new york had 
been on their original schedule 
the embassy announcement which did not elaborate on the health 
problem said the two countries had conducted a broad exchange of 
views on international issues and sinous bilateral relations in 
a sincere and friendly atmosphere 
if premier li is removed that could open the way for communist 
party chief zhao ziyang to assume his duties the us official 
said 
zhao won some favor by meeting with the student hunger strikers 
last week and opposing lis hardline stance 
secretary of state james a baker iii who earlier in the day 
lauded china for going in the right direction with its economic 
liberalization joined bush and his national security adviser brent 
scowcroft for the hourlong session with wan in the oval office 
the senior us official who offered the latest analysis said it 
is likely wan could organize a delegation of the peoples congress 
to meet with representatives of the students in order to meet their 
demand for a dialogue with the authorities 
the white house meeting with wan occurred as the turmoil 
continued in china where one million people defied martial law for 
a fifth straight day and filled the streets to demand lis 
resignation 
the demonstration was the strongest public display of wrath yet 
toward li who imposed martial law on saturday as the studentled 
effort for democratic reforms continued 
chinese leaders in particular senior leader deng xiaoping 
appear to believe that any use of military force to put down the 
demonstrations would have to be so extensive that it would be 
nearly impossible to carry out the official said 
for their part the students appear to have thwarted a 
widespread military crackdown by fomenting demonstrations in other 
cities besides beijing thereby weakening the military threat by 
forcing a dispersal of troop strength the official said 
on the other hand chinas renewal of television satellite 
transmissions is a sign that the power struggle continues and that 
li may be losing ground the official said

the christian democrats leadership in the chamber of deputies 
and the senate expressed their support of de mita as president

belonged to his fiveparty coalition but constantly jockeyed for 
power the other partners were the small republican social 
democrat and liberal parties 
de mita is serving in a caretaker role and will be in that 
capacity during the threeday visit of president bush beginning 
friday 
cossiga must find someone who can gather enough support to form 
a coalition no party has a majority in italy

cossiga and later told reporters the party confirmed its 
solidarity with the premier de mita and with the government 
forlanis party has dominated all cabinets since the end of 
world war ii in 1945 
forlani cautioned against turning to early elections to resolve 
the crisis elections are not scheduled until 1992 but could be 
moved up if needed to break a stalemate 
socialist leader bettino craxi de mitas main rival also met 
with cossiga and gave assurances the socialists were absolutely 
open to dialogue and collaboration

the army rounded up palestinian activists in 
raids on five villages in the west bank before dawn tuesday 
according to palestinian and israeli news reports 
in london prime minister yitzhak shamir dismissed as 
useless us calls on israel to withdraw from the occupied 
lands 
a proplo newspaper in jerusalem published a palestinian appeal 
to be presented at the arab summit in morocco urging arab leaders 
to reject israels peace plan and demand that the united states 
support creation of a palestinian state 
in the occupied west bank the army clamped curfews on five west 
bank villages ordered all men between the ages of 15 and 40 out of 
their homes and made a number of arrests the reports said 
among those detained were five palestinians from al mughayir 
near ramallah who were suspected of killing a fellow villager 
accused of collaborating with the israeli authorities according to 
the reports 
in kufr sur near tulkarem residents reported they were ordered 
to paint over antiisraeli slogans and remove palestinian flags 
they said tax agents accompanied the troops to collect back levies 
the national itim news agency quoted west bank commander maj 
gen amram mitzna as saying the army was using such raids to 
apprehend palestinian activists in the west bank and manifest 
control of the area 
last week the army arrested more than 250 moselem 
fundamentalist palestinian activists in th gaza strip 
also tuesday israeli troops shot and wounded eleven 
palestinians during stonethrowing protests arab hospital 
officials said one victim was a 70yearold woman from a village 
near nablus who was hit in the chest with a plastic bullet the 
doctors said 
the army confirmed the shooting in nablus and said soldiers 
wounded two other palestians in separate incidents an army 
spokesman said they were investigating the other reports 
the civil administration in the west bank destroyed seven 
illegally built houses in villages near hebron and the army 
declared a curfew on the town of jenin to prevent rioting after the 
death of a former mayor by an apparent heart attack israel radio 
said 
throughout the occupied lands palestinans staged a general 
strike tuesday declared by the plo underground leaders to mark the 
arab summit the strike was only partially observed in the gaza 
strip israel radio reported 
the appeal to participants of the arab league which convened 
tuesday was published in the east proplo jerusalem daily al fajr 
which described the document as the appeal from the state of 
palestine 
the appeal urged arab nations to support palestinian peace 
proposals which call for israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
lands and an international peace conference to resolve the 
arabisraeli conflict 
it also sought support for palestinian opposition in rejecting 
the israeli government plan to hold elections under occupation 
and ask the united states for clear recognition of palestinian 
rights to selfdetermination 
shamir rejected a call by us secretary of state james a baker 
iii for israel to stop building jewish settlements on occupied 
territory and reportedly said his governments peace plan ruled out 
giving up territory for peace 
the governments peace plan which obligates everyone rejects 
the formula israel radio quoted shamir as telling british 
officials in london in his peace plan shamir had previously left 
open the issue of territorial compromise 
shamir was asked about bakers call for israel to give up the 
idea of annexing the occupied lands and he replied i think it 
was useless 
shamir insisted the details of his peace plan should not be 
discussed until they can be negotiated with palestinians 
the plan calls for electing palestinians in the occupied lands 
to negotiate with israel on a temporary selfrule plan with talks 
to be held later on the final status of the territories 
palestinians object because the proposal does not guarantee them 
independence or an end to military rule 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel called bakers call for 
land concessions explosive and said it threatened the coalition 
government of shamirs rightwing likud bloc and the leftleaning 
labor party unlike likud labor favors returning some territory 
for peace 
we cant say no to baker because if we say no we wont 
have a palestinian negotiating partner said liel we cant 
say yes because if we say yes we wont have a government 
several rightwing politicians accused baker of trying to 
dictate israeli policies but haim ramon parliamentary leader of 
the labor party praised the speech as good for usisraeli 
relations 
the prime minister and foreign minister moshe arens are 
trying to sell some illusions to israel that the us is supporting 
the likud extreme policy and i think its good that citizens will 
be aware of the real us policy he said on israel radio 
palestinians in the occupied lands reacted favorably to bakers 
comments but noted he still said the united states does not favor 
creation of a palestinian state 
its a slap in the face of shamirs plan said hathem abu 
ghazale a plo supporter in the west bank city of nablus 
i believe bakers statement is positive but it is not the 
change the palestinians are asking for said ziad abu ziad 
editor of a proplo weekly newspaper

black members of congress who met with 
president bush on tuesday said he has agreed to consult them on 
contentious issues and they also said they hope to participate in 
shaping administration policy 
while they disagreed with bushs views on various domestic and 
foreign policy issues they said they are withholding judgment on 
his administration until he more fully develops his policies 
we saw this as an important beginning said rep ron 
dellums dcalif after the white house meeting of the 
congressional black caucus with bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii 
but some members expressed serious doubts about bushs 
commitment to many issues they raised during their hourlong 
meeting 
were dealing with a thousand lights without any batteries 
said rep charles rangel dny in reference to bushs often 
stated urging for all sectors of society to help make life better 
since the government cant afford to do it all 
rangel chairman of the house select committeee on narcotics 
said he has refrained from early criticism of bush 
ive been very restrained because anything is better than the 
last eight years under president reagan he said but how long 
can you wait rangel said bush lacks a specific strategy for 
helping poor persons fight crime and drug abuse but that he was 
willing to work with us to develop one 
i dont think there was any question about the presidents 
sincerity but where does all this go he asked 
during the meeting bush brought up budgetary constraints in 
talking about domestic issues the participants said 
rep john lewis dga said bush has proposed a do nothing 
budget right now they havent put forth an agenda he said 
but he added that he is willing to give bush more time 
participants said that in regard to crime bush appeared open to 
expanding his policy from a heavy focus on law enforcement and 
punishment to include other factors such as education housing and 
health care 
but on south africa the caucus members said he held out no hope 
he would come around to their view that more sanctions are needed 
to pressure the white minority government to negotiate with 
representatives of the black majority 
dellums said bush agreed to meet with the group again and to 
have cabinet members meet with them to discuss other issues 
by contrast during the reagan administration black caucus 
members went to the white house at the beginning of 1981 and were 
never invited back dellums said 
despite the differences some caucus members shied away from 
criticism of bush 
we recognize the president is evolving his policies said 
rep mickey leland dtexas 
we want to be significant players in that policy dellums 
said 
rep john conyers dmich said that while its totally 
unclear where were going at least the administration is willing 
to set up a mechanism to hear ideas from legislators who disagree 
with the republican administration 
caucus members think bush is not looking at what they say are 
the root causes of drug abuse and crime unemployment poverty 
lack of housing and poor education 
we were concerned about his priorities there leland said 
dellums said bush indicated he was prepared to expand his 
analysis to include an appreciation for the fact that there are 
other systemic problems that have to be dealt with and that the 
issue of drugs is not going to be eradicated simply by law 
enforcement 
but conyers called bushs anticrime plan strictly draconian 
and supplyside oriented

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini underwent 
surgery tuesday to stop intestinal bleeding and his son said the 
89yearold revolutionary patriarch was in very good condition 
there is nothing for the people to worry about the operation 
was successfully completed this morning and the doctors are 
satisfied and happy with the results ahmad khomeini said on 
tehran radio 
tehran television showed the fiveman medical team that 
performed the surgery and quoted one of the doctors as saying 
khomeini was in excellent condition 
in paris however an exiled shiite moslem leader told the 
associated press he understood khomeini had lost a great deal of 
blood and was in precarious condition ayatollah mehdi 
rouhani would not reveal his sources or provide details 
tehran television showed khomeini leaning on a stick and walking 
slowly into hospital accompanied by his son 
it also showed khomeini in a shawl rubbing a string of worry 
beads and connected to an intravenous tube reclining on a hospital 
bed it was not clear when the footage was taken 
in a later broadcast showing the medical team the chief surgeon 
dr hassan arefi said that for his age khomeini was in excellent 
condition and had been taking his usual two or three 25minute 
walks every day until monday 
cardiologist iraj fazel said the intestinal problem was detected 
several days ago and he added 
there was no time pressure naturally we did have some 
concerns during the operation but none of these 
materialized 
president ali khamenei urged irans 50 million people to pray 
to allah in thanks for the successful surgery tehran radio 
reported 
ahmad khomeini 43 said his fathers condition was very good 
and in the future will get even better 
we decided not to hide anything from the people he said 
some blood had been detected in the imams digestive tract the 
doctors and surgeons consulted among themselves and concluded the 
best course would be to operate this was discussed with the imam 
and he agreed that the doctors should do whatever they thought 
best 
news of the illness which had not been reported once again 
raised the question of who will govern iran after the imam whose 
fundamentalist revolution overthrew shah mohammad reza pahlavi a 
decade ago 
on march 28 khomeini dumped his designated successor ayatollah 
husseinali montazeri for criticizing his policies and appointed a 
20man constitutional committee to decide who will preside after 
his death 
iran has been in political turmoil since a truce aug 20 in the 
8yearold war with iraq with factions jostling for supremacy in 
the succession 
khomeinis office issued a brief statement announcing the 
surgery and few details were provided by tehran radio or the 
official islamic republic news agency both monitored in nicosia 
his office said in part the operation on imam khomeini which 
was undertaken tuesday morning to stop bleeding in his digestive 
system was successfully completed and praise the lord his 
condition is completely satisfactory 
reports that khomeini was ailing have circulated frequently 
since he suffered a heart attack three years ago 
an unconfirmed report late last year said he had prostate 
cancer he rarely emerges from his heavily guarded home jamaran a 
northern tehran suburb 
the last time tehran tv showed khomeini speaking was in taped 
excerpts of a february meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze the first audience he had granted to a foreign 
dignitary 
television frequently shows khomeini in the mosque adjacent to 
his residence sitting on a platform about 6 feet above the crowd 
he appears frail moves slowly and does not speak 
ahmad is constantly at khomeinis side the son controls access 
to his father and has assumed a greater political role in recent 
months causing speculation about his ambitions 
last week iranian newspapers published a long letter from ahmad 
khomeini to montazeri harshly criticizing him for questioning the 
imams decisions 
the constitutional committees deliberations on changing the 
1979 charter has occurred in an atmosphere of wrangling between the 
socalled radicals and pragmatists of the tehran hierarchy 
hashemi rafsanjani parliament speaker and pragmatist leader 
wants to eliminate the post of prime minister and give the 
presidency wider powers in order to end a competition for power 
that often paralyzes the government 
presidential elections are scheduled for august when incumbent 
ali khameneis second fouryear term expires rafsanjani also 
acting military commanderinchief is the only announced candidate 
without a single figure invested with the imams combination of 
spiritual and political authority indications are that iran will 
have a collective leadership after he dies khomeini has kept any 
group from gaining overall power by repeatedly changing sides 
political infighting was muted during the war with iraq but 
burst into the open after the ceasefire 
khomeini called his decision to accept the truce more deadly 
to me than poison 
rafsanjani tried to improve relations with the west get 
reconstruction aid and open up the economy radicals led by prime 
minister hussein musavi and interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
want iran to remain aloof 
khomeini came down on the radical side in february and started a 
new confrontation with the west by ordering his followers to kill 
salman rushdie an indianborn british novelist he said blasphemed 
islam in the novel the satanic verses

province said tuesday that authorities have detained 237 ethnic 
albanians without charge there and are keeping them in isolation

in the interests of albanian nationalism and separatism and who 
exposed their hostile positions according to the state tanjug

and clashes between ethnic albanian rioters and yugoslav security 
forces killed at least 25 people including two policemen 
ethnic albanians make up about 85 percent of kosovos population 
of 18 million they were protesting constitutional changes which 
limited the wide autonomy enjoyed by the province and gave the 
republic of serbia a greater say in running kosovos affairs 
yugoslavia is composed of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces 
a state of emergency was imposed in kosovo followed by a 
crackdown in which more than 800 people were arrested on charges 
rising from the disturbances

prominent ethnic albanian politicians intellectuals and other 
community leaders who opposed the constitutional amendments

belgrade on tuesday to protest alleged harassment by police in 
their home region 
another 100 villagers from mosevac 180 miles west of belgrade 
were to join the protest hunger strikers told the associated press 
behind the demonstration is a feud dating to 1986 between the 
local official youth organization and communist leaders in the 
village the young people accuse the leaders of corruption and 
political nepotism 
the protest started last saturday over the arrest of hasan 
delic a local youth activist on may 13 delic has fasted in jail 
for eight days press reports said 
local officials and police were alleged to have misappropriated 
funds collected for a village community hall

a french humanitarian organization said tuesday its 
doctors concluded through investigations in the soviet republic of 
georgia that toxic gases killed some demonstrators who died in a 
clash there with police last month 
medecins sans frontiers doctors without borders said in a 
statement that chloropicrine was identified as one of the gases 
responsible on the basis of autopsy results in 16 cases 
the statement said the fourmember french team worked with 
american colleagues from the group physicians for human rights 
with georgian doctors and with representatives from the georgian 
health ministry it said the team would address further questions 
upon returning to paris on wednesday 
the organizations dr marc gastellu etchegorry said 
chloropicrine had been approved in the soviet union for use as a 
tear gas until 1981 when it was reclassified as a suffocant or 
asphyxiating gas for combat use 
nineteen people died in clashes between police and georgian 
nationalists on april 9 in tbilisi the republics capital police 
shot and killed a 20th person later as a curfew violator 
the foreign medical investigators were invited by the georgian 
government and by andrei sakharov prominent soviet dissident 
human rights campaigner nuclear physicist and nobel peace laureate 
the doctors examined and questioned about 100 hospitalized 
patients 
they said hundreds of people were admitted to hospitals 
beginning on april 17 more than a week after the clash believing 
they suffered secondary effects from the toxic gases 
the statement said the doctors concluded these people were 
suffering from a panic syndrome caused by psychological trauma and 
not from chemical effects from gases 
the french doctors group says it understands chloropicrine is 
made in the united states as well as the soviet union the doctors 
assume but do not know for a fact that the gas is part of 
military stockpile rather than used as tear gas in riot control 
the army general in command of soviet forces in georgia gen 
igor rodionov denied on april 30 that his troops used toxic gas 
but said interior ministry units had tear gas he did not say that 
they used it

a man with a long history of assaults on 
children has been charged with raping and sexually mutilating a 
7yearold boy a tragedy officials and relatives say they were 
stymied from preventing 
hes my brother and i love him but god hes driven the whole 
family nuts for 20 years john shriner said after older brother 
earl kenneth shriners arraignment monday 
police said an assailant lured the boy into the woods and 
repeatedly and violently raped him choked him stabbed him in the 
back and cut off his penis 
shriner 39 pleaded innocent in pierce county superior court to 
attempted murder rape and assault in the attack on the boy who 
was found saturday wandering in shock in a south tacoma woods 
naked bloody and with a noose wrapped around his neck he was in 
satisfactory condition at a hospital tuesday 
bail for shriner was set at 1 million pending a trial july 17 
about 50 people crowded into the courtroom and about a dozen 
placardwaving demonstrators protested outside the countycity 
building against the crime the boys doctor dr john coombs 
called it the most outrageous thing ive ever seen 
state sen phil talmadge of seattle ranking democrat on the 
senate law and justice committee said he will write the state 
department of corrections and department of social and health 
services asking why shriner was free 
i want to see their explanation talmadge said tuesday 
this guy by all accounts had no business being out on the 
street 
spokesmen for corrections and for the states indeterminate 
sentence review board said they kept shriner locked up as long as 
they could 
i totally understand the frustration said dennis marsh the 
boards executive secretary i guess from our perspective the 
parole boards perspective there was nothing we could do 
i guess the next guestion is who needs to do what and when 
shriners criminal history dates to 1965 when he was declared a 
defective delinquent after choking a 7yearold girl the 
nowoutdated term was used to designate delinquents considered to 
have mental or emotional reasons for committing violent acts 
in 1966 he was sent to a school for people with developmental 
disabilities after he led authorities to the body of lorretta marie 
sturtz a 15yearold classmate at a school for the mentally 
retarded she had been strangled and left tied to a tree 
considered too dangerous by school officials shriner was committed 
to western state hospital from 1968 to 1973 
in 1976 he was acquitted in two separate assault cases but 
pleaded guilty in may 1977 to assaulting two 16yearold female 
hitchhikers the judge ordered him committed to the sexual 
psychopath program at eastern state hospital but officials there 
refused to accept him he spent his entire 10year sentence at the 
shelton correctional center 
in the final months of his prison term shriner was found with 
lists of things he would need to maim or kill youngsters said 
kathryn s bail indeterminate sentence review board chairwoman 
we did everything legally possible to keep him in custody 
ms bail said 
at a hearing to commit shriner to a state hospital he was freed 
by a judge said frank mendizabal department of social and health 
services spokesman 
in november 1987 shriner pleaded guilty to assault in the 
stabbing of a 16yearold boy he served 66 days of a 90day 
sentence in october 1988 shriner pleaded guilty to attempted 
unlawful imprisonment in an attack on a 10yearold boy who was 
tied to a post and beaten he was sentenced to 67 days in jail 
the sentences were not longer because both cases involved the 
relatively minor charge of simple assault authorities said 
reports on shriner up to 1977 described shriner as mentally 
retarded but in 1987 psychiatrists and psychologists at a state 
hospital concluded he had a learning disability and other 
disorders including pedophilia and an antisocial personality 
shriner had been living with his mother before his arrest 
sunday she said monday that she loved her son but if he was 
guilty he should be put somewhere where hes safe and where 
people are safe from him 
tacoma police sgt stan mowre said police had warned residents 
in shriners neighborhood but couldnt specifically tell them 
about shriner and his record 
he had served every day of his sentence mowre said you 
cant go out and stigmatize someone and take out a billboard on 
them

yale princeton and dartmouth students 
have long held they were the first to pick up a pie tin made by the 
frisbie pie co and toss it back and forth but middlebury college 
insisted tuesday they were all wrong 
it happened all over america but it started here said 
middlebury president olin robison 
middlebury says its students started the pie tin toss 50 years 
ago and on tuesday the school unveiled a bronze statue of a dog 
catching a modernday version 
the 300pound statue by artist patrick villiers farrow of 
rutland was placed in a quadrangle where students play with 
frisbee flying discs now 
middlebury officials contend that a group of delta upsilon 
fraternity brothers happened upon the game while taking a road trip 
to a fraternity convention in nebraska 
short on money the frat brothers feasted on a 1939 favorite 
frisbie fruit pies while waiting for a flat tire to be repaired 
two du brothers began tossing the leftover tin back and forth to 
amuse themselves the story goes 
they shared the game with the entire campus when they returned 
according to an article in a spring 1976 issue of the middlesbury 
college newsletter 
that fall in middlebury 1939 the air was filled with flying 
pans every size and shape robison said tuesday quoting the 
story grade point averages dropped football attendance 
suffered and all stores were out of pie pans 
among those attending tuesdays ceremony was margaret cole 
stepmother of one of the fraternity members she has no doubt the 
middlebury students were the first 
the people from yale they just caught on said cole who 
remembers the sudden disappearance of tin pie plates from stores 
after the fad took off she switched to pyrex dishes for her pies 
because they were too heavy they didnt fly well 
also on hand was paul eriksson one of the fraternity brothers 
who went on the 1939 road trip eriksson a book publisher said he 
cant quite remember the exact circumstances of that first pie tin 
toss 
and he doesnt remember much about the convention because the du 
brothers only sent one member to all the meetings during their 
stay in nebraska erikson said we probably threw frisbies 
after world war ii the travels of the flying pie tins become 
easier to document according to dan roddick of the whamo 
manufacturing co in san gabriel calif which makes the modern 
frisbee flying disc 
in 1948 west coast inventor walter fred morrison made plastic 
versions of the old pie tin and marketed them as flying saucers in 
1957 whamo manufacturing co began selling them under a 
registered trademark 
while marketing the new product whamo discovered the 
popularity of flying pie plates and liked the name but company 
officials didnt realize the origin of the name and misspelled it 
he said 
as to the documentation on who cast the first one without a 
blueberry pie in it thats a bit of a challenge roddick said 
roddick said the controversy has been fierce at times he 
recalled a series of letters between graduates of yale and 
princeton in yales alumni magazine in which students presented 
documentation on where when and how the first flying disc was 
thrown 
roddick said there is documentation indicating children in 
colonial times played with flying wooden discs that were called 
sailors 
i think what you have here is a pretty spontaneous response to 
a natural opportunity roddick said 
now 27 countries belong to the world flying disc federation and 
the national association of sporting goods manufacturers lists 57 
companies that market flying saucers roddick said 
eriksson seemed unfazed by the ruckus 
who would of thought that a silly little thing like throwing a 
pie tin would turn into a national pastime he said

secretary of commerce robert mosbacher 
believes a tentative driftnet fishing agreement with japan is 
inadequate and will ask the state department to negotiate a new 
one a commerce department spokesman said tuesday 
northwest lawmakers fishing groups and environmentalists who 
have been critical of the pact praised mosbachers decision and 
urged us officials to adopt a tougher stance in future talks 
japanese officials previously told the state department the 
agreement was only a takeitorleaveit basis and said they would 
be unwilling to reopen negotiations 
japan along with south korea and taiwan faces possible trade 
sanctions on fishery products exported to the united states if 
driftnet agreements are not signed by june 29 
an estimated 700 to 1000 fishing vessels from japan south 
korea and taiwan use driftnets in the north pacific ostensibly to 
catch squid 
the monofilament smallmesh nets which can stretch more than 
30 miles long hang in the water and snare virtually any mammal 
bird or fish which comes in contact the nets can cover more than 
30000 miles of ocean in a day 
mosbacher believes the treaty calls for too few observers on 
japanese driftnet vessels and not enough patrol vessels in the 
legal driftnet zone in the north pacific to ensure compliance said 
ranjit de silva a commerce department spokesman 
de silva also said mosbacher is concerned over the japanese 
rejection of a proposal to place transponders on their vessels so 
their locations could be tracked by satellite 
the secretary is not satisfied with it the agreement and 
wants the state department to renegotiate focusing on these 
points said de silva 
mosbacher has the authority to decide whether the agreements 
satisfy the monitoring and enforcement provisions of the driftnet 
act passed by congress in 1987 
us fishermen insist the driftnet fleets are intentionally 
catching salmon under the guise of harvesting squid and they say 
salmon runs in alaska washington and oregon have dropped sharply 
as a result 
environmentalists charge driftnets are responsible for the 
deaths of thousands of porpoises seals seabirds and other marine 
life each year 
the tentative treaty with japan would allow 32 observers to be 
placed aboard the estimated 460 japanese vessels using driftnets 
and would increase from four to five the number of japanese patrol 
boats in the vast area where squid fishing is allowed 
the japanese also indicated they were unilaterally expanding the 
legal driftnet fish zone 120 miles north 
this is the outcome weve been working for sen frank 
murkowski ralaska said of mosbachers decision 
murkowski said he wants secretary of state james a baker iii to 
appoint a tough special negotiator who will make sure the us 
point of view is represented strongly and effectively 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash said baker should reopen talks at 
the highest level and a new treaty should increase the number 
of observers and patrol boats and require transponders on japanese 
vessels 
dem cowles a spokesman for the united fishermen of alaska said 
the tentative agreement was the absolute wrong message to send to 
the japanese south korean and taiwanese fishermen who are acting 
like pirates out there 
cowles group represents 18000 fishermen from alaska 
washington state oregon and california

the house foreign affairs committee voted 
2212 on tuesday to moderate senatepassed legislation which 
includes conditions on the transfer us aerospace technology to 
japan for the coproduction of the fsx jet fighter 
but republican members said the legislation remains veto 
bait because president bush opposes any restrictions on his 
ability to negotiate the agreement with the japanese government 
rep william broomfield rmich ranking republican on the 
panel said he has been told by secretary of state james a baker 
iii that any restrictions on the fsx deal will be vetoed 
william clark assistant secretary of statedesignate for east 
asian affairs said the administration believes that any changes 
would require us as goodfaith negotiators to reapproach the 
japanese 
the house panel refined legislation drafted by sen robert c 
byrd dwva after that body narrowly defeated 5247 a 
resolution to disapprove the codevelopment deal 
the byrd legislation imposing restrictions on the president in 
hammering out future coproduction arrangements was adopted by the 
senate 7227 
the house panel adopted a substitute drafted by rep stephen j 
solarz dny which makes two major changes in byrds proposal 
the byrd amendment would impose a flat prohibition on the 
transfer of critical us engine technology to japan during 
coproduction 
solarz changed that to an expression of congressional sentiment 
that such technology should not be transferred and giving the house 
and senate a chance at vetoing the arrangement if a transfer was 
approved 
the byrd legislation also flatly bars japan from selling or 
transferring the fsx or its technology to a third country 
the solarz version sets up a mechanism for congress to 
disapprove such a sale if the president were to approve it but 
does not ban it outright 
the solarzdrafted legislation retained provisions requiring a 
general accounting office study of the effects of the fsx 
arrangement on the american aircraft and aerospace industry as well 
as a provision calling on the president to seek at least a 40 
percent share of the benefits of the deal for us industry 
this sense of the congress statement is motherhood and apple 
pie solarz said of the latter provision it does not require 
renegotiation if the president does not get 40 percent so be it 
but now he can say to the japanese congress wants us to get no 
less than 40 percent 
if the house were to pass the legislation as approved by the 
committee differences with the senatepassed provision would be 
ironed out by a senatehouse conference 
the agreement calls for usbased general dynamics and 
mitsubuishi heavy industries of japan to jointly develop and build 
the fsx which would be an advanced version of general dynamics 
f16 for use in the japanese air force starting late in the next 
decade

rebels on tuesday blamed the government 
for a raid by armed men on a train carrying relief supplies to 
southern sudan where starvation threatens thousands of people 
a government statement monday said the gunmen stole the 
personal belongings of three western relief officials aboard 
the train but did not touch the supplies 
also tuesday herman cohen assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs arrived in khartoum to discuss efforts to end the 
6yearold civil war 
information minister hussein abusaleh met with cohen and said 
the us diplomat promised american assistance to the peace efforts 
and called the governments actions to gain a truce positive 
cohen is to spend three days in sudan and then go to ethiopia to 
meet with representatives of the rebels sudan peoples liberation 
army 
lam akol an spla spokesman in nairobi kenya claimed that 
governmentequipped militias stopped and boarded the relief train 
carrying 1500 tons of foodstuffs and he said the attack was 
sanctioned by khartoum 
the government statement said about 100 armed men boarded the 
train sunday nine miles north of malwal saying they were looking 
for foreigners it said that after robbing the three relief 
officials the gunmen ordered the train crew to continue the trip to 
the governmentcontrolled town of aweil 
the train left muglad in southwestern sudan saturday for aweil 
180 miles farther south with stops en route in the towns of malwal 
and maput 
it has 48 freight cars and malwal maput and aweil are each to 
receive the load from 16 cars 
maput is held by the rebels but akol denied reports that they 
also control malwal 
he said the train was attacked to terrorize the people in malwal 
so they would flee and we will have nothing to capture 
akol said the rebels accepted that two thirds of the food go 
to governmentheld areas because the movement of the train depended 
on that agreement 
spla leader john garang announced early in may a unilateral 
ceasefire for one month to assist the unbacked relief program 
that is trying to stockpile enough food in the south to save about 
100000 people from starving 
many of the people facing starvation live in villages isolated 
by the civil war 
sudan has been torn for decades by conflicts between southern 
sudan populated mainly by christians and animists and the 
predominantly moslem north that controls the federal government in 
khartoum 
the spla began fighting in 1983 demanding more economic 
development and greater automony for the southern provinces

students shouted down with communism 
when a provincial court refused tuesday to register their 
prosolidarity association and they declared a sitin strike at 
warsaw university 
some students threatened to boycott polands first democratic 
elections since world war ii they accused the court of trying to 
divide the opposition before the june 4 parliamentary elections 
communist authorities also banned a scheduled 
solidarityproduced election show from state tv tuesday night 
saying it violated limits which may not be crossed the tv 
announcement was made at 1035 pm the time the program was to go 
on the air on polands second channel a television announcer 
instead read an official communique explaining why the solidarity 
show was blocked 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said earlier the 
student association ruling was legally unjustified politically 
damaging and violated the agreement on reforms reached last month 
between the government and the opposition 
students we were and still are in solidarity with you said 
a statement from the independent union movements warsaw regional 
chapter it backed student strikes and asked solidarity factory 
committees to extend immediate help 
judge danuta widawska of warsaw provincial court told about 300 
students and a handful of older solidarity activists packing the 
courtroom that the registration request was rejected 
students shouted no and angrily chanted and stamped their 
feet when she offered to explain it and she hurriedly left the 
courtroom 
sympathizers and students later marched through the city and 
scuffled with police students said 15 demonstrators were arrested 
leaders of the student association at the 16000student warsaw 
university said they are taking over the campus and boycotting 
classes to demand legalization they hoisted a huge banner 
announcing the action at the main campus gate 
edward sadkowski the provincial court chairman said in a 
telephone interview that the decision stemmed from the groups 
claim of the right to strike 
student association lawyer piotr andrzejewski had argued that 
student strikes have a long tradition in poland and are not 
expressly forbidden so they should be considered legal 
student leader piotr czerwiec said the association would appeal 
to the supreme court this week but it was unlikely the decision 
could be reversed before the elections 
andrzejewski told the court it was required to register the 
association because of promises made by communist authorities at 
roundtable talks on reform with the solidarityled opposition 
that ended april 5 
this today was a clear attack on the whole round table and 
its decisions he said i see a threat directed above all 
against the election campaign of solidarity 
part of the students will turn back from the elections he 
said of students who have been helping solidarity candidates 
campaign with the great mass of undecideds and with the 
communists tearing down our posters there will not be anybody to 
put them back up it may all end very badly 
solidarity is waging a spirited campaign for candidates to a new 
100member senate and for 161 seats in the existing 460member 
parliament the rest are reserved for the ruling communist party 
and its allies 
registration of the students assocation like the legalization 
of the independent workers union solidarity and the farmers union 
rural solidarity was a condition for the opposition agreeing to 
participate in the elections 
all three organizations were banned after martial law was 
imposed in poland in december 1981 the other two were legalized 
soon after the talks ended last month 
some student leaders blamed older solidarity leaders for not 
fighting more for their association 
solidarity did not press hard enough said andrzej 
jesionowski of the student associations national commission 
solidarity was promised access to state tv and radio in the 
roundtable talks and tuesdays canceled broadcast was to have 
been the third such solidarityproduced tv show the first 
45minute program was may 9 
a management communique put out by the states pap news agency 
said the program will be referred to an arbitration committee 
composed of authorities and solidarity activists for viewing and 
mutual assessment 
it said the programs contents aim against the roundtable 
agreements but gave no particulars

negotiators for striking teachers and the 
school district flew separately to sacramento on tuesday for 
meetings with state legislators as both sides blamed the other for 
failing to end the walkout 
it just has to come to an end soon im angry im hurt 
and im disappointed carole keen president of the 10th district 
pta said as the strike entered its 10th day in the nations second 
largest school district 
the strike has cut deeply into attendance by the more than half 
million students of the los angeles unified school district while 
the majority of the united teacherslos angeles members remained 
out of school 
the district canceled its 4a division baseball championship 
playoffs because of the walkout affecting 16 senior high school 
boys teams the head coaches of all the teams refused to break 
their strike the district said 
there were contradictory statements from both sides on what was 
last placed on the bargaining table for consideration sunday night 
when talks collapsed 
teachers want a 22 percent pay raise over two years and have 
indicated they would take a 26 percent pay hike over three years 
they earn between 23440 and 43319 a year depending on 
experience and level of education 
education in the district has slowed to a crawl since the union 
representing 22000 of the districts 32000 teachers went on 
strike may 15 most classes wind up june 23 but some schools 
operate yearround 
it is the districts first strike since a 23day walkout in 1970 
utla president wayne johnson and superintendent leonard britton 
met separately behind closed doors with the los angeles delegation 
of the state legislature to discuss ways of securing the school 
districts projected 485 million share of an anticipated twoyear 
state tax surplus of 25 billion 
johnson said board members were misinformed about the contract 
offer teachers rejected and blamed chief district negotiator dick 
fisher for the confusion he said at least four of the seven board 
members should attend future negotiating sessions 
on monday board member jackie goldberg who has generally 
supported the union contradicted a statement by johnson that the 
board had not offered teachers anything new before the breakoff in 
talks i think people have the right to know what really 
happened she said 
she said the board offered a 24 percent raise over three years 
with no conditions 
johnson called fisher a major impediment toward a settlement 
this guy wants to keep a strike going and is doing it by 
confusing the board and by confusing the issues he added 
youve got the whole process in absolute turmoil 
johnson insisted there was no money proposal even proposed 
sunday night ill take a polygraph on it 
but fisher said tuesday the 24 percent offer 8 percent each 
year was made as an informal exploratory package through a 
state mediator the secondyear raise was contingent on the 
district receiving the state tax surplus funds otherwise the 
raise for the second year would be dropped to 5 percent 
that offer was immediately and angrily rejected by the utla 
negotiators and therefore no longer remains on the table fisher 
said in a statement 
school district spokeswoman eva hain said the idea of having at 
least a majority of school board members present at negotiations 
has been suggested before by johnson she said adding school board 
members might slow the negotiations 
currently each side has three negotiators the school board is 
represented by president roberta weintraub

the united states is not satisfied with a new 
west german proposal for resolving a nato dispute over shortrange 
missiles and there is still a gap to bridge secretary of state 
james a baker iii said tuesday 
baker said he hoped the disagreement could be settled before 
mondays opening of a 16member nato summit in brussels but said 
theres no assurance that will happen 
he said the stumbling block was how to draft a compromise 
plan that would take into account the new mood in western europe 
for greater disarmament while preserving an adequate deterrence 
the alliance has survived many greater threats to its 
existence than this and we remain quite hopeful that well get 
his resolved and that well get it resolved before the summit 
baker said we may not get it resolved before the summit 
at a news conference at the white house baker also announced 
june 19 as the date for resuming ussoviet negotiations to reduce 
longrange nuclear weapons 
the talks were suspended last november with about 90 percent of 
the work completed on a treaty to curb strategic missiles bombers 
and nuclear submarines 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
said he was pleased with the return to negotiations but expressed 
concerns about unresolved problems he mentioned the debate over 
star wars and the absence of a consensus in congress and even the 
bush administration over modernization of landbased nuclear 
missiles 
the wisconsin democrat said bush still is on trial with 
conservatives and it will be difficult for him to make a deal on 
start 
the dispute in nato was triggered by west german demands for 
eastwest negotiations to begin soon to reduce nuclear missiles 
with a range of less than 300 miles 
the united states and britain opposed such talks on grounds the 
west needs nuclear weapons in europe to offset a big advantage in 
ground forces tanks and other conventional forces by the 
sovietled warsaw pact nations 
last week the united states agreed to accept the principle of 
eventual negotiations but only under stringent conditions 
baker said it would have to be made clear that if there were 
ever to be negotiations in this area we would not be talking about 
in any event about a third zero arms control jargon for 
complete elimination of the missiles 
he said that nuclear deterrence has been the cornerstone of 
natos flexible response strategy under which military threats 
to the west would be countered by a range of options from tanks 
and combat troops to nuclear weapons 
the flexible response strategy has kept the peace for 40 
years baker said we should be very very reluctant to take 
any steps that would be seen to be moving away from that 
for days bonn and washington have been trading proposals and 
counterproposals to produce a compromise the latest offer from 
bonn was received monday night 
baker said it did not go far enough 
it is not resolved there is still a gap to bridge and well 
continue to work to try to bridge that gap he said 
trying to play down the discord baker said i just dont 
think that it will totally dominate the summit on the other 
hand he said it will be a very very important issue 
a major dispute centers on the timing of any talks on 
shortrange weapons while bonn wants talks to begin soon the 
united states is insisting on a formula that would put off 
negotiations for years according to an administration official who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity 
the official said the united states wants the negotiations to be 
delayed pending an eastwest agreement to reduce the levels of 
conventional forces where the west says the east has a large 
advantage 
explaining why it would be years before talks could begin on 
shortrange nuclear missiles the official said it takes that 
long to negotiate an agreement on conventional forces and 
actually pull out troops and tanks

controversial claims of roomtemperature 
fusion were discounted or found only qualified support tuesday 
among scientists presenting the results of their own experiments at 
an international workshop tuesday 
physicists and chemists from the massachusetts institute of 
technology and oak ridge national laboratory rejected confirmation 
of roomtemperature nuclear fusion reported by the university of 
utah exactly two months ago 
utah electrochemist stanley pons and british colleague martin 
fleischmann startled the scientific world with the announcement 
they had achieved cold fusion in a simple experiment involving 
electrodes of the metal palladium and water made with deuterium a 
heavy isotope of hydrogen 
the conventional belief was that fusion as an energy source 
would only be attained at high temperatures and by applying high 
power 
mit chemist richard crooks told the estimated 500 participants 
that after conducting experiments similar to the fleischmannpons 
work none of the telltale signs of fusion including excess heat 
the tritium isotope of hydrogen and neutron radiation were found 
the evidence of fusion products is much too small to account 
for fusion said crooks 
later he told reporters that there is no evidence nuclear 
processes are going on 
theres always room for something new and unanticipated you 
always keep your eye out for that said crooks 
he also took a swipe at pons and fleischmanns research 
methods saying they have had to back down on some of their 
assertions 
were getting back into the realm of really good science and 
out of the realm of quick and dirty experiments he said 
mit plasma fusion researcher stanley luckhardt said he does not 
believe anyone at the conference will turn up the definitive proof 
of cold fusion 
i think we would have heard it in the halls he said 
luckhardt said the problem is that researchers have measured 
heat in some experiments and a small amount of fusion byproducts in 
others but no one has managed to find both heat and particles 
the closest thing to confirmation of the ponsfleischmann 
findings came from texas aampm university chemist john appleby who 
reported finding sizeable amounts of tritium in texas aampm 
experiments 
appleby said at a news conference that tritium can be coming 
only from fusion that is the bottom line 
during a presentation opening the threeday workshop appleby 
said his research turned up evidence of what he called anomalous 
heat 
he described a series of experiments using different forms of 
the metal palladium and different solutions some including lithium 
and sodium which yielded varying results 
in a solution of lithium and deuterium he said an anomalous 
effect takes place 
aampm scientist kevin wolf told the assembly that separate tests 
turned up evidence that a small number of neutrons and larger 
amounts of tritium had been released in texas experiments similar 
to those conducted by pons and fleischmann 
wolf said the number of neutrons produced was up to seven times 
the number expected in nature 
appleby said that since little is known about the fusion 
occurring within the structure of a metal there may be reactions 
taking place that are unknown 
appleby said he was disappointed but not surprised that the aampm 
experiments did not find the presence of helium 3 a product of the 
fusion of two heavy hydrogen atoms 
he said it would be given off at a very low level not enough to 
be detected 
appleby also said that if the amount of deuterium that has to 
infiltrate the palladium electrodes is crucial then scientists 
using small palladium wires such as used by aampm should expect 
to see results more quickly than researchers using large bars or 
rods of palladium

bad weather forced the air force to 
postpone the launch of an advanced navigational satellite for the 
third time tuesday 
winds above the launch pad were too strong and there was a 
forecast that thunderstorms would move into the area said an air 
force statement 
the effort was called off nearly two hours before the planned 
743 pm edt launch another attempt was set for wednesday at 739 
pm 
the launch of the delta 2 rocket was scrubbed saturday by 
highaltitude winds and on sunday by a thunderstorm 
the rocket carries a 65 million navstar satellite that will 
enable us and allied military units such as planes ships 
submarines and tanks to determine their location within 50 feet 
anywhere around the globe

lawmakers complained tuesday about an air 
force request to spend about 15 billion to fix the b1b bombers 
defensive system while funds for the b2 stealth bomber are being 
cut 
lt gen ronald w yates the air forces principal deputy 
assistant secretary for acquisition told a house panel that the 
current fleet of 97 b1b bombers has problems with its electronic 
countermeasure system or ecm which includes its jamming 
capability and its ability to identify and avoid threats 
the service is asking for 1454 billion to repair the 
electronic system that would push the air force past the 205 
billion cap placed on spending for the program in 1981 
the problems stem from the original contract the air force 
signed with eaton ail a massachusetts company for the b1b 
bomber the service agreed on a development and production pact on 
the same day and since then has faced cost overruns and problems 
with the electronic system 
what youre telling us is the ecm is less good by 10 percent 
than the original promise nine years later that is the sum said 
rep les aspin dwis the house armed services committee chairman 
who also heads the subcommittee on procurement 
yes that is the sum responded yates 
the air force official said the service could not defend what 
had happened nine years ago but needs the additional money to 
improve the bombers ability to identify threats 
rep ike skelton dmo taking yates through basic questions 
about the b1b asked how many b1bs existed and whether they were 
flyable more or less 
more or less responded yates 
the air force official than explained that the bombers have 
deficiencies in the ability to detect and avoid threats and 
jamming capability is limited 
you misjudged the problems in the original specs skelton 
said 
we didnt misjudge what we did was fail technically in 
the ecm yates said 
aspin expressed concerns about spending money on the b1b while 
funds for the b2 stealth bomber will be cut 8846 million in the 
fiscal 1990 budget 
defense secretary dick cheney faced with a budget agreement 
between the white house and congress was forced to slash 10 
billion from the defense budget the b2 program was among the 
programs that were scaled back 
the wisconsin democrat said he was unsure how the problem would 
be resolved but added i think we got programs in competition 
here if we fully fund the b1 it may come back to haunt the b2

king hassan ii on tuesday welcomed 
egypt back to the arab league after 10 years of ostracism as he 
opened a summit conference focusing on sharp divisions over lebanon 
and the palestinians 
egyptian president hosni mubarak urged greater solidarity among 
the leagues 22 member nations and said the arab world hopes this 
conference will mark a new dawn 
hassan said he was happy to see the egyptian leader here among 
us representing his people the people of arab egypt who have 
fought and struggled for a halfcentury in support of arab 
rights 
twentyone arab leaders are attending the twoday summit 
including col moammar gadhafi of libya who had threatened to 
boycott the meeting in protest over egypts readmission 
only lebanon ruled by rival christian and moslem governments 
was not represented for the first time since the arab league was 
formed in 1945 
hassan greeted his guests at the entrance to the palace as they 
began arriving separately at 6 pm in bulletproof limousines the 
king did not embrace gadhafi as he had the other leaders 
the leaders held a twohour informal session and convened again 
behind closed doors after speeches by hassan and mubarak 
conference sources said the main topic was lebanon 
mubarak reading from a prepared text called the gathering an 
historical conference convening in an atmosphere of brotherhood 
he warned against wasting time and opportunities 
interarab difference mubarak said are inevitable but 
disagreement should not lead to quarrel 
he called for a wider arab role in international efforts for 
global peace and for closer cooperation with the 12nation european 
economic community 
mubarak said the crisis in lebanon has truly become an immense 
problem exhausting us and exhausting our consciences 
we must all work for the one aim of overcoming this crisis 
before the fire burns us all he said 
he said arabs should start by backing a sixman arab panel that 
has been trying to defuse the crisis so it could arrange national 
reconciliation ensure the withdrawal of all foreign forces and 
revive the constitutional bodies so they can carry out their 
duties 
lebanons seat remained vacant after a preparatory meeting of 
foreign ministers failed to agree on which leader should represent 
the country torn by 14 years of civil war 
on the palestinian question mubarak openly supported 
antiisraeli rioting that has raged in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip since december 1987 
egypts membership in the arab league was suspended after the 
late president anwar sadat signed the camp david peace treaty with 
israel in 1979 making egypt the only arab nation to have made 
peace with israel 
we support the palestinian people in its resistance of 
occupation and israeli hegemony he said 
he said egypt would back whatever road the palestinians find 
suitable to realize their aspirations 
the palestine liberation organization and syria had presented 
rival documents to the preparatory meeting of ministers 
the first dealt mainly with plo chief yasser arafats peace 
moves and a demand that arabs meet their pledge of more than 600 
million to finance the 17monthold uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories 
syrias paper spoke of combining arab resources to achieve 
strategic parity with israel indicating it still opposes a 
negotiated settlement 
an egyptian compromise was adopted but its contents have not 
been revealed 
some delegates said they feared the summit would break down over 
lebanon 
iraq and egypt have said they would seek a resolution demanding 
withdrawal of all foreign forces from the country 
that would includes 40000 syrian soldiers deployed under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the league and israeli troopers who 
occupy a security zone in south lebanon 
after four years of relative quiet the lebanese civil war 
revived march 8 when artillery duels began between christian army 
units commanded by aoun and an alliance of syrian forces and druse 
militiamen hundreds of people have been killed and nearly 1400 
wounded nearly all of them civilians 
seating one or both of lebanons rival leaders at the summit 
christian gen michel aoun and moslem premier salim hoss would 
have perpetuated the division and might have caused a walkout by 
syria or iraq which are enemies of long standing syrian supports 
hoss and iraq is aouns only outpoken supporter in the arab world

he backed into a pursuing police car 
the boy was sent to a state juvenile center in baton rouge said 
baldwin police chief al gros he was charged with three counts of 
unauthorized use of an automobile and other traffic offenses 
the chase began when someone reported a car being driven in a 
reckless manner said detective sabria hill 
i knew it was a child in the car you could just see the top 
of his little head above the dashboard she said 
hill said police couldnt get too close during the chase 
every time we put on the siren hed speed up and if we got 
to close hed speed up he got up over 60 miles an hour several 
times so we just backed off she said 
the boy started the car with a screwdriver the detective said 
baldwin police said it was the third time the boy had taken the 
car and that he had admitted to five burglaries in the past year 
he knew how to shift thats for sure he drove pretty well

a missile 
designed to guide itself in and destroy enemy radar posts underwent 
its second successful test the air force announced tuesday 
the agm136a missile code named tacit rainbow flew may 17 at 
this high desert test base but the test wasnt previously 
revealed it was the second of 25 planned tests the air force said 
the missile was launched from a b52 bomber and homed in on its 
target even though the radar it tracks was shut off once during 
the flight the air force said 
the joint navyair force project is administered by the 
aeronautical systems division of the air force systems command at 
wrightpatterson air force base near dayton ohio the missile is 
built by northrop corp of los angeles which also makes the b2 
stealth bomber and other military hardware 
the agm136a is similar to present antiradar missiles which 
follow enemy radar waves to their source and destroy the 
installation however the new missile is designed to loiter 
or go into a holding pattern if the radar is turned off thus 
countering a defense that can be used against such missiles

a volunteer troglodyte who lost track of 
time while living 130 days alone in a sealed cave without hearing 
another humans voice returned to daylight tuesday and exclaimed 
wow man 
stefania follini had to put sunglasses over her regular glasses 
when she poked her head out of the cave entrance under the bright 
midday sun the temperature was 97 degrees a big difference from 
the caves constant 74 degrees 
the temperature was in the mid30s and it was before dawn when 
the italian volunteer for a scientific experiment entered lost cave 
in the hills on the west side of carlsbad on jan 13 
miss follini apparently learned some english during her 
isolation and told a crowd of welcomers i feel great she had 
taken english primers into the cave with her to study the language 
she nodded when asked if she would do it again and said sure 
it was very beautiful to live down there she said through 
an interpreter at a news conference a few minutes later but it 
also feels nice to be up here and i feel all right 
she said the first thing she noticed was the smell of the desert 
and the noise made by the 60 reporters and wellwishers 
she said she will remember the silence in the cave and its 
smell its an old smell in a romantic way she said 
miss follini appeared calm and happy and said she had not 
dwelled on things she missed 
asked the first thing she wanted to do she replied i think 
ill have a long walk ill think about all the things id like to 
do later 
the 27yearold interior decorator from ancona italy was the 
subject of an experiment designed to simulate the solitude of 
interplanetary spaceflight and other forms of isolation 
i hope with this research to find a way to prepare people 
going in space or submarines said maurizio montalbini the 
experiment coordinator for the italian research team 
in the absence of day and night or timepieces of any kind miss 
follini began staying awake 20 to 25 hours at a time and sleeping 
about 10 her menstrual cycle stopped when she was notified monday 
the 130day experiment was almost over she reacted with disbelief 
because she thought about 80 days had passed 
her only contact with the world above ground was a computer 
linked to another computer in the researchers house trailer 30 
feet above her 
she couldnt see or hear anyone though researchers could 
monitor her by means of three video cameras and microphones inside 
the cave while she set a record for isolation for a woman 
she spent the time reading decorating her 10footsquare 
plexiglas room inside the sealed cave with cardboard cutouts 
practicing calisthenics and judo moves playing solitaire and 
chatting with researchers by typing messages on the computer 
in the coming days miss follini will be studied like a 
laboratory rat scientists want to take blood samples measure her 
flexibility muscle tone and physical condition and measure her 
ability to reason and concentrate 
they believe her muscle tone and the level of calcium in her 
bones decreased that her immune system became depressed and that 
her ability to concentrate improved 
miss follini will spend memorial day in houston with university 
of texas medical school scientists who are sharing their 
information with the national aeronautics and space administration 
they will monitor her brain activity while she does computerized 
problemsolving exercises 
were going to see if there are any attention problems 
resulting from her isolation and determine which neural pathways 
are working most efficiently said dr jon defrance an assistant 
professor at the medical school 
montalbini said monday he thought miss folllini might surprise 
researchers when they discover what kind of shape she is in he 
said she kept her strength and flexibility by exercising and 
maintained her mental poise by keeping busy 
she is doing very well montalbini said she is 
psychologically well settled 
montalbini spent 210 days in cave isolation two years ago 
the researchers chose lost cave in southeastern new mexico 
because it maintains a constant climate of 74 degrees and 99 
percent humidity and is relatively close to nasas johnson space 
center and the medical school in houston 
the experiment whose cost was estimated at 200000 to 
250000 was funded by the university of ancona in italy

government and the opposition 
the delegation from the organization of american states arrived 
earlier to mixed reactions and took a conciliatory tone 
we are going to try to facilitate dialogue among panamanians 
this is a situation that only panamanians can resolve said 
foreign minister diego cordovez of ecuador one of four oas 
delegates 
they are investigating charges that panamas de facto ruler 
gen manuel antonio noriega nullified national elections to 
prevent an opposition victory 
in washington defense officials said the united states was 
sending armed military convoys on trips across panama to flex our 
muscles and draw a line against panamanian harassment 
two convoys of 10 or so vehicles carrying armed soldiers have 
crossed without incident in either directions under escort by 
panamanian soldiers as provided in the canal treaties the 
officials said on condition of anonymity 
rafael vargas santos ambassador to haiti said in 
portauprince the government would destroy the panama canal in the 
event of a us invasion 
we will not be taken by surprise because we are already 
prepared he said on radio haiti inter the first thing we will 
do is blow up the canal 
cordovez oas secretarygeneral joao baena soares and foreign 
ministers sahadeo basdeo of trinidad and mario palencia of 
guatemala met with acting president manuel solis palma and several 
cabinet members for two hours but issued no statement 
panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter said he could not say 
what was discussed but said the meeting was positive amicable 
i think it was a very cordial wideranging and positive 
climate 
the group will meet with other political figures over the 
next 10 days baena soares said no plans for a meeting with 
noriega were mentioned 
opposition leaders who want their may 7 presidential election 
victory recognized had welcomed the delegation and said the 
panamerican organization has understood the urgent need to act 
but the government proclaimed earlier it would not accept any 
interference in panamas internal affairs governmentcontrolled 
media accused the organization of prejudging the case 
theyll come they wont see and theyll leave said a 
headline in matutino newspaper 
the oas last week denounced noriega and called for a swift 
transfer of power 
solis palmas government issued a proclamation monday night 
saying parts of the organizations resolution violate its charter 
including the illwilled mention of noriega 
the government proclamation however welcomed the mission and 
said it hoped it would establish the truth of the crisis as a 
conflict between panama and the united states it cited us 
sanctions against panama as proof of malice 
tuesday newspapers accused the organization of being led by the 
united states but cordovez described its resolution as a latin 
american effort based on principles that we all respect the 
principle of nonintervention 
in his arrival statement cordovez said latin americans are 
concerned about panama and the mission is a gesture of good will 
a gesture of friendship and solidarity that should not be 
misinterpreted 
the opposition has called for a demonstration at noon wednesday 
in defiance of a government ban on demonstrations that lasts until 
june 5 when the organization of american states mission is to file 
its report 
noriega who commands panamas defense forces was indicted on 
drug trafficking charges in the united states in february 1988 he 
denies the charges and says they are part of a us plot to renege 
on its commitment to hand over the panama canal at the end of 1999

a combination of chemotherapy and radiation 
shows promise of helping doctors avoid mutilating surgery and 
preserve the voices of victims of advanced neck cancer researchers 
said tuesday 
until now the standard therapy for people with advanced cancer 
of the larynx has been to remove the voicebox while this approach 
frequently cures the disease it destroys patients ability to talk 
about 11000 new cases of cancer of the larynx are diagnosed 
annually and 4000 to 5000 of these people have advanced disease 
that requires surgical removal of the larynx followed by radiation 
therapy 
in the new approach doctors shrink the tumors first with 
chemotherapy drugs then they destroy the remaining cancer with 
radiation 
they can talk normally by and large said dr gregory wolf 
of the university of michigan 
wolf described the experimental therapy conducted with dr waun 
hong of md anderson cancer center in houston at the annual 
meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
its extremely unsatisfactory for most patients to lose their 
voicebox commented dr richard hoppe of stanford university 
it has been necessary in the past because thats the only 
possible way they could be cured this will have a major impact 
because people have preservation of the voicebox 
in treatment so far 332 patients have been randomly assigned to 
have surgery or chemotherapy about 65 percent of patients in both 
groups are still free of cancer after two years of followup 
the researchers said that when this form of cancer relapses it 
usually comes back within the first two years 
in some cases the chemotherapy could not reduce the cancer 
enough for radiation to clear up what was left and these people 
required surgery however 68 percent of those treated with the new 
approach have preserved their voiceboxes 
the results are quite encouraging said wolf we hope this 
can be applied to other parts of the head where mutilating surgery 
is performed 
in all 30000 to 40000 new cases of cancer of the head and 
neck are diagnosed in the united states each year according to dr 
hardinder garewal of the veterans administration medical center in 
tucson ariz 
one common variety is cancer of the mouth which like the 
others often results from smoking and alcohol abuse 
recent studies have found that vitamin a can reverse 
precancerous white patches in the mouth known as oral leukoplakia 
however this vitamin is too toxic to the liver to be used in high 
enough doses to be a practical treatment 
in other research presented at the meeting garewal reported 
that a natural nutrient called beta carotene can clear up 
leukoplakia this substance found in many vegetables is converted 
into vitamin a in the body 
garewal treated 25 people for three to six months the white 
spots went away in threequarters of them and they suffered no 
serious side effects 
they took daily 30 milligram capsules of beta carotene which he 
said is the equivalent of six carrots he said that if the findings 
hold up to further study it may be possible to find ways of 
treating the condition by changing peoples diets

lawyers for house speaker jim wright and the 
ethics committee clashed tuesday over whether the panel had 
stretched the rules when it charged the nations highest elected 
democrat with 69 ethics violations 
and wright who watched the proceedings on television appeared 
less than confident that he could survive as speaker regardless of 
the outcome of tuesdays hearing that remains to be seen he 
said if i cant be not just a respectable speaker but an 
effective speaker then i wouldnt want to be speaker 
wrights houston lawyer stephen susman pleaded with the 
committee to stand in the way of a lynch mob seeking to oust 
wright and asked that the panel reject what he termed the speakers 
persecution by the panels special outside counsel richard j 
phelan 
to say jim wright should be condemned because he went close to 
the line is not fair susman said in arguing that the panel 
should dismiss the most serious charges against his client 
but phelan a chicago attorney declared that wright is resting 
his case on legalisms and he said ethics rules should be 
interpreted broadly not treated like tax laws where searching for 
loopholes is an accepted practice 
we are dealing with the confidence of the american public 
phelan said are we to look at the rules through the prism of the 
most nearsighted myopic person that we can 
the unusual triallike proceeding was held in a house hearing 
room before tv cameras with wrights counsel and the ethics 
committees team led by phelan on opposite sides although wright 
watched on television his wife betty sat in the front row 
a decision on the motion was expected as early as wednesday 
leaving the capitol after the daylong hearing wright said he 
hoped the ruling would go his way but added that if not he would 
take his case before the nation at a disciplinary hearing 
im not going to let people down im not going to leave any 
implication that ive done anything bad he said i certainly 
abided by the rules as i understand them 
 
asked whether he believed he could survive as speaker he said 
 
it was just the first open skirmish in the nearly yearlong 
ethics probe of wright which has thrown his political survival into 
doubt the speaker is still likely to face a disciplinary hearing 
before the ethics panel to determine whether charges against him 
have been clearly and convincingly proven and possible punishment 
by the full house 
another member of wrights legal team william c oldaker had 
conceded in advance of tuesdays hearing that motions to dismiss 
charges are routinely denied and that chances that the committee 
would rule in wrights favor when it meets wednesday were less than 
even wrights motion essentially asks the panel to reverse an 
interpretation of the rules it made last month 
but susman pleading for the panel to reconsider read a passage 
from wrights book which is the basis for some of the charges and 
asked each member of the committee to doubt a little of his own 
infallibility 
another member of wrights eightlawyer defense team rep 
robert torricelli dnj said wright needs a victory thats 
clear 
whatever the legal outcome some in the house were already 
writing wrights political obituary saying he had been so tainted 
by the charges that he could no longer serve effectively as the 
democrats most visible national spokesman a group of moderate 
wright supporters met last week and discussed ways for the speaker 
to ease gracefully out of his leadership post 
one fellow democrat rep jim slattery of kansas said in a 
statement tuesday if the speaker is not exonerated by the ethics 
panel and if the ethics committee concludes that speaker wright has 
violated house rules then i think he should resign 
slattery who is considering a race for the kansas governors 
office has come under attack from republicans portraying him as a 
close ally of wright 
susman tried to minimize the charges against wright which 
include accepting 145000 in gifts from a fort worth businessman 
with a direct interest in legislation and evading house income 
limits through bulk sales of wrights book 
to any fair person that hardly sounds like much of a 
scheme he said at one point in a reference to sales of the book 
reflections of a public man 
and susman suggested that wright is being pilloried in political 
retribution for democratic rejection of the nomination of john 
tower as secretary of defense or for his handling of the 
controversial congressional pay raise issue earlier this year 
why worry about due process for a dead man the lawyer asked 
rhetorically why should this committee stand in the way of a 
lynch mob or a conviction based upon guilt by association 
because he said in answer to his own question to the six 
democrats and six republicans on the panel if a member of 
congress indeed the most powerful member of congress cannot get a 
fair trial no american can 
wrights case for dismissal rested on a contention that the 
ethics committee formally called the committee on standards of 
official conduct is holding him to a new and higher standard not 
envisioned by the authors of the rules 
susman accused phelan who has led the panels investigation of 
wright since last july of picking out the speaker as a target 
then searching the law books to pin some offense on him 
on wrights book deals in which he sold bulk quantities of the 
slim volume to groups to which he had made speeches phelan argued 
that the facts were clear look at what happened did he make a 
speech or did he sell a book he said 
and on wrights relationship with fort worth developer george 
mallick who gave betty wright a salary and use of a car and 
condominium valued at 145000 over 10 years phelan suggested 
mallick wanted something in return from the powerful congressman 
who was his friend 
does that stand the test of credibility he asked what is 
the average american supposed to think

the mother of a teenager who claims she 
had sex with us rep donald lukens testified tuesday that the 
congressman offered her a government job after she told him her 
daughter was 16 
i didnt think he would stoop that low but he did anna 
coffman said i took it as a bribe 
attorneys for lukens disputed the charges in opening arguments 
before the prosecution began its case against the 58yearold 
conservative republican in county domestic relations court 
lukens is charged with contributing to the unruliness or 
delinquency of rosie coffman now 17 she says she and 
then19yearold michelle foster went to lukens columbus apartment 
in november to have sex with him and the prosecution says money 
was exchanged 
lukens contends the charges are part of an attempt by mrs 
coffman to extort money from him if convicted of the misdemeanor 
lukens faces a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a 1000 
fine 
mrs coffman testified that the relationship between lukens and 
her daughter began in 1985 when rosie coffman was 13 
she said she called lukens that year to discuss him 
contributing to her delinquency by getting her intoxicated and 
told him the girl was 13 
three years later she said she again confronted him during a 
meeting secretly videotaped by a television station at mrs 
coffmans initiative 
i told him how old she was mrs coffman said adding she 
showed him pictures of the girl it didnt bother him a bit 
because apparently hes been doing that all along 
she said lukens told her he thought her daughter was 18 the 
younger coffman turned 17 on nov 7 the day after the alleged 
encounter 
mrs coffman said that after she learned of the relationship by 
overhearing a conversation between her daughter and ms foster her 
first reaction was to contact someone to let them know about it 
i knew if i would call the police i would get the runaround 
she said she contacted franklin county children services then 
called wsyxtv which arranged the videotaping the 50minute tape 
in which lukens is barely audible was shown to the jury tuesday 
mrs coffman said she contacted the television station because 
she was afraid of lukens and i wanted to get him exposed for what 
he did 
defense attorney thomas tyack attacked a part of mrs coffmans 
testimony in which she said she called lukens hamilton office 
using a number on a business card he gave her daughter in 1985 that 
identified him as a congressman 
can i ask you how you did that when mr lukens didnt become a 
member of congress until 1987 he said 
i didnt know what he was mrs coffman said lukens was in 
congress for two terms in the 1960s then ran unsuccessfully for 
governor and served in the state legislature 
mrs coffman also admitted under tyacks questioning that wsyx 
paid for mrs coffman and her daughter to stay at a columbus hotel 
earlier this year and that she was paid 1500 by local television 
show evening magazine for an interview 
in opening arguments assistant prosecutor rita mangini said 
lukens when questioned by police denied having sex with the girl 
but later admitted to a private detective that he did have sex with 
her 
tyack told jurors that lukens admits the girl visited his 
apartment on the night in question but that what happened inside 
is a matter of dispute

france exploded a small nuclear 
device on mururoa atoll in the south pacific on wednesday in its 
second such test this year new zealand scientists said 
at two kilotons the equivalent in explosive force of 2000 tons 
of tnt it was one of the smallest underground explosions in recent 
years said warwick smith director of the governmental department 
of scientific and industrial research 
the explosion was recorded at the new zealand monitoring station 
in raratonga cook islands but was not identified immediately 
because it was so small smith said he said the explosion took 
place at 6 am 2 pm edt tuesday 
the nuclear test was in line with the french program for the 
last five years which has involved four explosions from april to 
june and another four between october and december 
the last nuclear test on may 11 registered 15 kilotons france 
has conducted about 105 nuclear tests on mururoa since taking its 
program underground in 1975

representatives of the northern marianas 
islands told congress on tuesday that the united states has ignored 
the provision of its convenant with their government that calls for 
periodic talks 
only six meetings have been held since the us and the islands 
in the south pacific established a political union 13 years ago a 
seventh round of talks was scheduled to begin wednesday 
the lack of progress in six rounds of the talks sends us a 
negative message benjamin manglona president of the northern 
marianas senate told the house interior subcommittee on insular 
and international affairs we begin to wonder if the united 
states government really believes in the democratic institutions it 
has given us 
the talks have been going on for some two and a half years 
without producing much more than travel vouchers said proilan 
cruz tenorio resident representative to the us from the 
marianas it seems that the talks are more cosmetic than anything 
else that they are designed to give only the appearance of 
progress and to provide a platform for political posturing 
spain colonized the northern marianas islands located in the 
pacific ocean about 1200 miles east of the philippines in 1564 
and ruled them for three centuries before selling them to germany 
japan occupied the islands in 1914 and held them under a league of 
nations mandate through world war ii 
the united states direct relationship with the northern 
marianas began in the summer of 1944 when the us armed forces 
liberated them from japan 
the federal government reached a covenant with the islands 13 
years ago that established a political union and laid out rules for 
how the two governments would relate to each other the 
selfgoverned islands would still fall under the jurisdiction of 
the us 
the agreement included several provisions to compensate for the 
lack of the commonwealths participation in federal 
decisionmaking including one section setting up a structure for 
talks about concerns of either government 
at first the talks were hampered because of delays by the 
president of the united states to appoint a representative later 
problems arose because of conflicts between the representatives 
a spokesman for the northern marianas said they were not 
satisfied with the us representative becky norton dunlap of the 
interior department 
the first and most obvious problem with the talks at this 
moment is that president reagans special representative is still 
on the job and it is not at all clear that she represents 
president bush said tenorio 
manglona criticized use of the interior department in the talks 
calling it neither productive nor proper 
there always will be the tendency for that special 
representative to protect the institutional interests of the 
department said manglona 
he said the northern marianas should be dealing directly with 
the state department or the white house 
dunlop told the committee she believed her meetings with the 
islands representatives had been productive and had the support of 
president bush 
she said the interior department helped get the department of 
transportation to provide essential air service to tinian and rota 
and the state department to encourage nongovernmental third 
country assistance 
issues to be discussed at this weeks meeting include 
selfgovernment citizenship micronesian war claims trade 
barriers tuna fishing banking taxation international relations 
and regional cooperation ocean rights and resources and taxexempt 
bonds

a trainload of red army t72 
tanks pulled out of czechoslovakia tuesday after a modest ceremony 
featuring a soviet military brass band playing russian folksongs 
and mothers appealing for peace 
a banner in russian reading have a nice journey fluttered 
in the breeze 
no speeches were made 
soviet troops first came permanently to czechoslovakia after 
they led a warsaw pact invasion in august 1968 to crush liberal 
reforms known as the prague spring under former communist party 
leader alexander dubcek 
a woman resident who refused to give her name told reporters 
we want peace and if the guys up there want to fight it out 
among themselves let them we dont need armies for that 
other women who said they had sons about to do their compulsory 
military service echoed her call for peace 
the first stage of the present pullout was completed march 17 
when an airborne battalion left the slovak city of zvolen 240 
miles east of prague 
that departure went unpublicized in czechoslovakias staterun 
media another battalion was withdrawn with slightly more fanfare 
from the moravian city of olomouc near the polish border 10 days 
ago but czechoslovak authorities have not trumpeted the 
withdrawals as much as communist leaders in neighboring hungary 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has announced plans to 
withdraw 50000 soviet troops from east europe by 1991 
according to soviet lt gen yuri shchepin the red army chief 
of staff 264 vehicles and 887 soldiers have left czechoslovakia to 
date 
on tuesday 23 tanks pulled out of the small village of krupka 
near bohosudov about 60 miles from prague 
altogether 1500 men 192 tanks and 20 fighter planes are 
scheduled to leave czechoslovakia in 1989 shchepin told reporters 
at bohosudov tuesday 
he said the tanks withdrawn tuesday would be taken to the black 
sea port of novorossiysk some to be scrapped and others used for 
unspecified nonmilitary purposes 
you can see with your own eyes that we are not only talking 
about wanting peace but taking concrete steps shchepin said 
we would welcome a similar initiative from nato countries too

the national transportation safety board said 
tuesday that aloha airlines had itself to blame for last years 
accident over the pacific ocean in which an attendant was sucked to 
her death after the planes fuselage peeled open 
the board voted 41 to assess as the accidents probable 
cause the failure of alohas maintenance workers to detect the 
presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the 
skin of the 19yearold boeing 737 
as contributing causes the ntsb cited the federal aviation 
administration for improperly assessing the airlines inspection 
program and for issuing inadequate orders to ensure the safety of 
older airliners 
specifically the ntsb said the faa had erred by not ordering 
that rivets along joints in the 737s outer skin be replaced much 
earlier than they were 
it was the april 28 1988 accident that heightened concerns 
about aging airlines the aloha plane had made more than 90000 
takeoffs and had been one of the first 12 built by boeing 
the board issuing safety recommendations urged the faa to 
closely watch airlines with unusually high numbers of heavily used 
older planes modernize training requirements for airline 
mechanics step up inspections of boeing 737s for additional 
fatigue problems and develop a program to monitor aircraft 
corrosion 
but the ntsb rejected a recommendation drawn up by its staff 
that would have criticized the cockpit crew of aloha flight 243 for 
landing the damaged plane in a way that added stress to what was 
left of the boeing 737 
board members said that proposed conclusion was unfair because 
it ignored the heroic actions of pilots and flight attendants 
board member joseph nall dissented from the ntsb vote to assess 
probable cause saying he wanted to blame the aviation system 
generally for not dealing sooner with the problem of aging 
airliners 
the ntsb has no authority to impose penalties and can only make 
recommendations to government agencies transportation companies 
and others 
earlier in the day ntsb investigator james wildey told the 
board that an examination of the planes fuselage showed it had 
either been repaired improperly by aloha or not repaired at all 
the piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue 
cracks that were underneath the repair patches between the repair 
patches and on either side of the repair patches wildey a 
metallurgist said 
airline president a maurice myers later took exception to that 
analysis saying there is substantial evidence that those 
multiple cracks were not detectable 
he said the accident represents a system failure on the part 
of the manufacturer the faa and his airline 
the system should have found the problems before it got to 
this stage he commented 
wildey also told the board that an unnamed passenger reported 
noticing a crack in the fuselage near the door as she boarded the 
plane wildey said airline inspectors had missed the crack 
investigators said that rivets had been installed in such a way 
as to concentrate stress that led to tiny cracks in several areas 
of the fuselages of the first 291 737s built by boeing an faa 
order to replace the rivets became final two weeks ago but airlines 
still have several months to do the work 
newer 737s do not have the problem because a different method 
was used to bind together sections of the fuselage skin 
investigators said 
board member jim burnett said there are indications the faa had 
not followed recommendations from the planes manufacturer in 
issuing maintenance directives to airlines 
he noted that one boeing service bulletin directed airlines to 
replace rivets along the fuselage where the aloha 737 split open 
but an faa airworthiness directive was vague in its requirements 
he said 
the real issue is that the faa didnt follow through on 
boeing alert service bulletins burnett maintained 
the airline has said it followed all required procedures for 
inspecting and maintaining its planes 
chief ntsb investigator barry trotter said aloha has improved 
its maintenance program since the april 28 1988 accident 
myers said the airline was in full compliance with faa 
requirements and industry standards at the time of the accident 
and has since made many changes 
myers said aloha has scrapped three of its 737s including the 
one that ripped open and purchased several new planes giving its 
fleet an average age of 10 years compared with 15 at the time of 
the accident

women who took birth control pills while 
teenagers in the 1960s face about five times the usual risk of 
breast cancer before they reach menopause a study concludes 
the research conducted in sweden is one of several recent 
studies to raise concerns that the pill may increase the odds of 
breast cancer 
while describing their findings as alarming the researchers 
cautioned that birth control pills have changed substantially since 
their introduction and newer pills may not heighten the risk of 
breast cancer 
the research directed by dr hakan olsson and colleagues from 
university hospital in lund was presented monday at the annual

think we have to correct it ms morrow said monday that would 
make us stronger too i feel it would help us as a race

could prove her supervisor also black harassed and ultimately

william tolliver looks at life through a 
different brush stroke 
he cant explain how he does it but art dealers and collectors 
from around the nation grab his works forcing him to turn down 
offers to go on show in galleries because he cant paint fast 
enough to keep up with the demand for his creations 
i put a stroke there two strokes here and let the strokes 
dictate what im doing tolliver says i might start out with a 
cotton field and end up with a mother and child it may be in 
abstract or impressionism in some instances they paint 
themselves its just a feeling 
the feeling is everything for tolliver who learned to paint 
from a paintbynumbers set when he was 14 and not busy carrying 
water to fellow cotton pickers in the mississippi delta country 
i could draw anything i could see by the time i was 9 he 
said it was like playing music by ear but painting is 
different the man who invented that paintbynumber thing was 
great i learned the principles of blending colors everything 
tolliver a high school dropout then began reading every book 
he could find on art and the masters most of his works feature 
people mostly cotton pickers or landscapes of shanties and lazy 
streams 
thats my background and what i paint is the nostalgia i 
feel but ive only been doing this professionally for seven years 
as i grow and see new things ill paint from a new background 
the artist said 
the old background does just fine for tolliver who has painted 
1000 pieces selling all but a few that are on display in his 
studio in downtown lafayette he now commands a minimum of 1000 a 
painting 
his works hang in the zigler museum in jennings la a few feet 
away from a rembrandt and a van dyke and in the new orleans museum 
of art his work also has been displayed at african american arts 
the heartland in los angeles and displayed in the rotunda of 
the us senate building in washington hampton university in 
virginia has purchased several of his paintings 
now some universities dont want my paintings because they 
say im commercial because my work sells tolliver said it 
doesnt make sense to me i dont know a painter anywhere who dont 
want to sell his work 
they say i paint what people like thats funny i paint what 
i like from impressionism to modern art whatever i feel i cant 
help it because people like it 
the 37yearold native of vicksburg miss lied about his age 
when he was 14 and joined the jobs corps to learn carpentry he 
finally moved to lafayette to take advantage of the brief oil boom 
he never thought about painting for a living until 1983 when he 
was laid off as a carpenter one of the thousands of victims of the 
oil patch crash in louisiana 
painting was a hobby nothing to make a living at he said 
but there was nothing else to do a lady i had worked for 
enrolled me in the lafayette art association and paid my dues 
tolliver then sent his wife to the association with two 
paintings to display but she went to the wrong place instead she 
wound up at the university of southwestern louisiana museum which 
gave her 150 for her husbands work 
frances love then the museum director purchased the paintings 
told tolliver about a local art gallery and the money began rolling 
in 
one of the paintings was absolutely beautiful love said 
it looked like the rare kind of fine impressionistic landscape 
that you might find in galleries in southern france

julien temple might be a shrewd cinematic 
jester who can make audiences laugh with the wacky earth girls 
are easy but hes also a solemn filmmaker who can weave dark 
tales about a celebrated crime photographer 
after the success of earth girls are easy his newest 
project is a gloomy study of weegee the new york crime 
photographer of the 1930s and 40s 
weegee was a repulsive fat bugeyed photorapist not 
necessarily your hollywood leading man but the back side of the 
character is vulnerable lonely and extremely talented the 
filmmaker said 
i really would like to do a dark and mysterious story now 
in earth girls are easy geena davis who won an academy 
award as supporting actress for her role of a dog trainer in the 
accidental tourist stars as a san fernando valley manicurist 
whose comatose suburban life is revived when a spaceship carrying 
three furry space aliens splashes into her swimming pool husband 
jeff goldblum damon wayans and jim carrey costar 
the movie musical overflows with kitschy production numbers as 
it honors the bizarre arrangement of life in southern california 
including a celebration of hair tint in the cause im a blond 
songanddance sequence 
i was playing with a culture that is only really been seen 
through the cliche of the total valley girl temple said but 
its actually a very powerful form of society its not a city in a 
traditional sense its just strange things thrown down in the 
mid50s like instant cake mix 
its seeped through with pop culture the obsession with 
beauty and fingernails and tans and fast food it is like its 
own little planet and i like making films about places as well as 
people 
the british filmmaker looked at life in the valley through the 
eyes of the aliens themselves 
its as extraordinary as going up the amazon he said of 
prowling around the local urban sprawl and that is thrilling as 
well as sometimes depressing and sometimes revolting 
colorful and kinetic earth girls are easy is distinguished 
by temples unusual visual style and attention to particulars one 
crowded seduction scene is littered with everything from a book 
called how to drive a man crazy to a jug of wesson oil 
i like the details just the little visual things that say 
how people think and feel emotionally he said 
the beauty parlor the line of work geenas character is in 
deals with crazycolored nails but her fiance is a kind of yuppie 
silvers and blacks and whites and these aliens are like three 
technicolor dream men who come down and make her think about her 
life 
he has combined vibrant visuals music and narrative before 
directing music videos for the rolling stones janet jackson boy 
george billy idol and david bowie he has also made commercials 
for a supermarket chain and elizabeth taylors passion for men 
perfume 
music videos are the freest form you get your own cut 
temple said ive never had a video changed on me by an artist 
and you dont have to go through the whole script development 
process it is a real laboratory of putting new ideas together 
temples video for rogers planet texas is an elaborate 
account filled with special effects of otherworldly cowboys 
transporting rogers to a living scifi novel in the sky produced 
for 600000 it is among the most expensive videos ever 
the process music television is very interesting that 
audiences can understand imagery that fast he said the 
challenge is to use it to create a new way of seeing 
i agree there are certain basic story lines but there are a 
million ways to play around with those storylines and then there 
are a million ways of differently shooting them earth girls 
is a fairly traditional love story its beauty and the beast 
with a little wizard of oz thrown in 
for now temple has had enough of tradition earth girls he 
said is not the ultimate kind of film that i would make 
its a part of getting to a point where i can do something darker 
you can only make movies if you deliver an audience and im aware 
of that and im trying to position myself 
while realizing that hollywood discourages experimentation 
temples profile of weegee whose real name was arthur fellig 
promises to be offbeat 
i think theres a great charge in reaching an audience and 
treating that audience with some respect and giving them something 
that really entertains but also plants certain ideas and questions 
in there 
i just wish cinema could be more responsive to real life

abcs peter jennings was longing to be in china 
last week like competitor dan rather of cbs but hes looking ahead 
now to taking world news tonight to europe next week and 
anchoring a primetime news special on thursday to set it all up 
jennings will report from brussels and london from may 29 to 
june 2 as president bush meets with leaders of nato allies unless 
something unusual happens though the story in western europe 
wont be as exciting as the one that cbs rather found himself in 
the middle of last week 
rather and cnns bernard shaw were the only us network anchors 
in beijing abc and nbc had correspondents on the scene but 
jennings and tom brokaw were in new york 
obviously i mean god i mean it would have been wonderful 
to have been there jennings said in a telephone interview 
monday theyda had a hard time dragging me back 
cbs got calls of complaint after rather and crew interrupted the 
season finale of dallas with live coverage of negotiations with 
chinese officials who had been sent to pull the plug on cbs 
satellite transmissions 
dallas fans aside it was a public relations coup for cbs 
news and for news junkies the live scenes from beijing were 
infinitely more fascinating than any cliffhanger on a nighttime 
soap 
cbs news however had not known it would land such a big story 
and in fact had gambled that events in say panama would not 
overshadow the real reason for the china trip the fourday visit 
to china by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev gorbachev came and 
went panama stayed put and the student protests in beijing became 
the story 
but the recent movements toward democracy in both the soviet 
union and in china have potentially profound implications for the 
united states relationship with nato on thursday night jennings 
will anchor a primetime special on the subject beyond the cold 
war the risk and the opportunity that will include an interview 
with secretary of state james baker iii 
i hate missing a big story but were about to go on to 
witness the president attempting to deal with a tumult which has 
far widerranging effects than whats been happening in china 
said jennings 
we were sort of thinking this morning how long could china go 
on having internal revolution before it would have a profound 
effect on the united states and the answer is a long time 
jennings said he agreed with abcs decision not to send him to 
beijing but in retrospect 
we know on a big event our audience expects us to go to 
them he said this is in some respects why we felt badly last 
week i dont think we were as frustrated last week as we could 
have been because sometimes you just luck out and theres no way 
its like ill tell you a really clean beat was when brokaw went 
to soviet armenia i thought that was a clear beat thats 
different from lucking into a story 
i thought my boss abc news president roone arledge was 
perfectly legitimate in saying listen the sovietchinese 
rapprochement is not a major story for americans its a major 
story but it certainly wasnt worth going over there for the 
broadcast 
but i didnt think that last week

elsewhere in television 
capitalism at work while the drama in beijing was unfolding on 
friday student demonstrators tensely awaiting possible action by 
government troops cnn and nbc bickered over cnns contention that 
nbc swiped 20 seconds of live satellite pictures during a morning 
news update cnn president burt reinhardt zipped off a telegram of 
protest to nbc news president michael gartner nbc said it was all 
a misunderstanding nbc news spokeswoman peggy hubble said nbc had 
experienced a problem with its transmitter and thought it had 
arranged to share the cable networks transmission during the live 
update anchored in new york by deborah norville there seems to 
be a professional courtesy in these things where we help each other 
out anything beyond that was a misunderstanding she said 
adding that if there was a misunderstanding nbc would apologize

when a nations interest rates begin to fall so 
goes the theory its economy becomes less attractive to foreigners 
who seek better returns elsewhere 
so goes the theory and so goes the reality off in a different 
direction its happening with the dollar right now to the dismay 
of some of the best minds in the monetary world the dollar is 
rising and they dont know why 
making the situation all the odder is the likelihood that west 
germany and japan might make their interest rates more attractive 
wouldnt you think that prospect would draw money from the dollar 
into the mark and the yen it hasnt 
the situation provokes the question why does reality so often 
contradict the publicly stated expectations and forecasts of 
experts and even as in the case of the dollar government 
efforts at manipulation of markets 
no 1 on any list of explanations has to be the reminder that 
there are few experts in financial monetary and economic matters 
and nobody at all who can foretell the future even when they have 
their hands on the controls 
thousands of individuals and large institutions pose as 
authorities on this vast unknown area and make a great living doing 
so but none of them offer any guarantees which is unusually 
foresightful of them 
there are other reasons too 
on policy matters for example government officials are not 
always able to speak their minds lest they influence the future in 
undesirable ways 
for the monetary head of a large country to express fear that 
the exchange value of a nations currency might rise in the next 
month could actually produce that rise by encouraging investors to 
buy into that nations currency 
domestically for the federal reserve board to say it planned to 
loosen the money supply could cause an explosion of unwanted 
economic activity the fed prefers instead to allow events to 
unfold and then explain its role 
on wall street notions about where the stock market is headed 
are often biased by selfinterest brokers want to make sales 
because commissions on sales are their livelihood opinions as a 
consequence may be akin to promotions 
little wonder that brokerage house buy signals are far more 
common than sell signals of course the latter generate 
commissions as surely as the former but buy signals alone 
bring in brandnew customers 
a customer who sells might never buy again and therefore never 
produce another commission a customer who buys on the other hand 
produces a commission now and remains a prospect for another 
commission when he sells 
all these are ingredients in explaining why reality so often 
differs from the forecasts and expectations there is another 
ingredient too the abundance of selfstyled aces seers geniuses 
and experts who claim to see the future 
few of these people can see any farther ahead than you can but 
as they say its a way to make a living and there arent any rules 
against doing what they do they are forecasters forecasters must 
forecast 
there appears to be an insatiable demand for their views right 
or wrong and most of the time they are wrong to a great degree and 
right only rarely and to a limited degree 
nevertheless they gain reputations as seers they seek 
publicity they publicize their occasional victories and forget 
their errors and hope the public will too often it does 
because of this one market letter writer remains in business 
after having cost his customers a fortune by keeping them out of 
the huge bull market of the 1980s so does another who once said 
gold would rise to 4000 an ounce 
why does reality so often go its own way in defiance of these 
geniuses why simply because reality has very little to do 
with such folks and above all it doesnt take orders from them

helen g oneill once familiar to millions of 
americans as the us navy poster girl in world war i is happy 
that women have found their place in the military but says they 
dont belong on seagoing vessels 
oneill who later became deputy director of women marines in 
world war ii is either 88 or 89 at this point it doesnt 
matter and lives alone in a treeshaded condominium village in 
suburban mclean va with memories of her days as a yeomanette 
or uniformed navy clerk from 1917 through 1921 
she was one of the first 12500 women to serve in navy uniforms 
recruited by navy secretary josephus daniels to free enlisted men 
for combat duty in the approaching war against germany 
wearing blue serge suits with anklelength skirts highlaced 
boots and straw skimmers the yeomanettes saw duty as typists 
bookkeepers radio operators switchboard operators couriers 
translators fingerprint experts decoders munitions factory 
workers recruiters and volunteer nurses during the influenza 
epidemic of 1918 
they were paid the same wages as sailors up to 60 a month for 
a chief petty officer but because the navy provided no barracks or 
mess halls for women yeomanettes rented rooms shared apartments 
or lived with family friends and received a subsistence allowance 
of 150 a day 
when the call went out for yeomanettes many newspapers 
published bitterly critical letters from readers preposterous 
wrote one irate retired colonel first the women wanted to vote 
then alice roosevelt started them smoking cigarettes now theyre 
talking about being soldiers next thing we know theyll be cutting 
off their hair and wearing pants 
like most yeomanettes oneill came from a comfortably 
middleclass home she lived in east boston across webster street 
from patrick joseph kennedy and his clan her childhood chum was 
margaret sister of joseph p kennedy and aunt of john f kennedy 
later to become president 
oneill got a college business administration degree took a 
civil service exam and received a job offer from the navy although 
her father protested that she was too young at 19 to leave home 
she packed her bags for washington for a clerical job at navy 
headquarters 
soon after she enlisted in the naval reserve the redhaired 
boston irish beauty was invited to pose for a portrait by painter 
howard chandler christy 
with a few months posters featuring oneill in uniform appeared 
on streets and in windows of navy recruiting offices around the 
country with the slogan i want you for the navy 
christy produced another perhaps more widely remembered poster 
portraying a different young woman who posed saucily in a sailors 
hat and jumper with this inscription gee i wish i were a man 
id join the navy the woman who inspired that poster was former 
yeomanette bernice tongate now 92 and reportedly living in a 
veterans home in retsill wash 
 
oneill was flattered but not surprised to see herself as a navy 
poster girl it was a thrilling hectic period in her life she 
says and anything happens in wartime 
in any event few of her friends recognized her in christys 
romanticized portrait she said 
after the war she returned to a civilian navy career that 
included a stint as aide to the assistant navy secretary when 
world war ii broke out oneill was second in line to take the oath 
as a woman marine and she quickly rose through the ranks to become 
deputy director of the womens corps she retired in 1959 as a 
lieutenant colonel 
oneill is pleased that 54000 women 10 percent of the navys 
uniformed personnel are working successfully alongside male 
officers and enlisted men 
i think theyve come a long way she said but i dont 
approve of women going to sea thats not fair to the mens wives 
of the navys 54000 women about 5000 are serving on 
noncombatant ships such as oilers destroyer and submarine 
tenders auxiliary vessels and diving and salvage ships 
oneill will be listed in a computerized honor roll at the women 
in military service for america memorial which will be built at 
the main entrance to arlington national cemetery to commemorate the 
estimated 2 million american women who have served with the armed 
forces since the revolutionary war 
the design of the 25 million memorial which will be financed 
through private donations is to be chosen november during veterans 
day weekend and construction is to begin in november 1991 
because records of military women are largely unavailable the 
monuments sponsors are asking women veterans to call 
18002222294 to provide information about themselves and their 
friends for the computer register 
oneill says she doesnt know how many yeomanette veterans are 
still living only about 200 remained when their national 
organization disbanded in 1986 
for a long time she lived here with her mother and sister both 
now dead she has never married 
i came close a couple of times but escaped she said no 
regrets

the ghost of andy warhol is everywhere these 
days 
this month alone a retrospective of the artists work ended a 
recordbreaking run at the museum of modern art his interview 
magazine has been put on the market his shot red marilyn 
fetched 4 million at christies and his infamous dishy diaries 
were published 
more than two years after warhol died at age 58 following gall 
bladder surgery the pop icon continues to hog the limelight in the 
contemporary art market even in death he has easily outlived his 
own saw that in the future everybody will be world famous for 
15 minutes 
in the book andy warhol a retrospective art historian 
robert rosenblum wrote that warhols own fame has far outlasted 
the 15 minutes he allotted to everyone else 
as artnews magazine has said its andy inc time 
last year sothebys sold 253 million of items from the warhol 
estate including cookie jars in the shape of pigs and puppies and 
early 19th century baltimore furniture warhol was on the cover of 
newsweek abcs 2020 did a feature on him and business week 
and forbes wrote about the 10day auction 
andymania as some art critics call it featured equal parts 
warhol the media superstar and warhol the artist the man credited 
with wedding fine art to popular culture after all silkscreened 
brillo boxes and campbells soup cans werent exactly considered 
art before warhol 
so who was this andy warhol 
if andy warhol is not the american dream then there is no 
american dream art critic edward w hayes said 
born andrew warhola in 1928 to an immigrant family in 
pittsburgh he collected autographed photos of movie stars as a 
youngster after graduating in 1949 from the carnegie institute of 
technology he changed his name to andy warhol and moved to new 
york seeking fame wealth and status 
as the late writer truman capote once said andy warhol wanted 
to be anyone but andy warhol 
infatuated with capote after seeing the authors photo on a book 
jacket warhol repeatedly wrote and called the writer ceasing only 
when capotes mother asked him to stop art historian marjorie 
frankel nathanson said 
by his mid20s warhol had become a successful commercial 
artist doing inventive window displays at bergdorf goodman and 
bonwit teller and works for glamour vogue and seventeen magazines 
he began dabbling in art making a 1956 shoe portrait of 
elvis presley in 1960 he painted canvases depicting comicstrip 
characters such as batman nancy and dick tracy 
his campbells soup cans appeared in 1962 as did drawings of 
corns on toes for dr scholl and his initial repetition pieces 
five coke bottles 192 onedollar bills and samph green 
stamps 
next came his famous liz taylor and marilyn series blue liz 
as cleopatra and turquoise marilyn in which he accented 
their lips and eyes in neonbright colors paintings of elvis troy 
donahue and warren beatty were other early efforts of celebrity 
portraits 
sixteen panels of jacqueline kennedy in 1963 show her grieving 
over her husbands assassination a similar period of darkness that 
year had warhol doing works on race riots the electric chair auto 
accidents and dismembered victims 
his thirteen most wanted men commissioned by the new york 
state pavillion for its building at the 1964 worlds fair was so 
politically charged sponsors asked him to paint it over 
kenneth silver an associate professor of fine arts at new york 
university told a warhol symposium last month at the moma that 
thirteen most wanted with its male pinups of the most 
soughtafter criminals in the united states showed the two 
issues of warhols art class and gender identification 
obviously silver said warhol was determined to introduce 
elements of his gay identity into his art 
after that warhol began five years of shooting voyeuristic 
films of his factory studio followers then he was shot and 
seriously wounded in 1968 by valerie solanis the sole member of 
scum the society for cutting up men 
he recovered and by 1970 had an exhibit at the pasadena 
calif art museum that toured chicago canada and much of europe 
what followed were the famous mao portraits beginning in 1972 that 
used dashes of synthetic polymer paint and silkscreen ink on canvas 
vivid lips and eyes popped up again in similar paintings of liza 
minnelli in 1978 and of rolling stones singer mick jagger 
factory follower ultra violet in her 1988 book famous for 15 
minutes my years with andy warhol described him as a shy 
near blind bald gay albino from ethnic pittsburgh 
but his art is another matter moma curator kynaston mcshine 
who selected warhols 300piece retrospective put together a show 
that is surprisingly moving the maos and marilyns are likely to 
endure as classics of our time 
the exhibit too has a sense of humor with warhol poking fun 
at his own penchant for publicity 
his 1981 myths had panels showing superman santa claus 
howdy doody mickey mouse uncle sam dracula the wicked witch of 
the east and andy warhol 
warhol once said if you want to know all about andy warhol 
just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me and 
there i am theres nothing behind it 
wrong critics say 
trevor fairbrother associate curator of contemporary arts at 
the museum of fine arts in boston told a symposium last month that 
warhol was an artist of consequence andy warhol had brains 
but could he paint the audience pressed walter hopps director 
of the menil collection in houston and moderator of the symposium 
yes he could really paint said walter hopps director of 
the menil collection in houston in an understatement 
the show sponsored by kroll international moves next month to 
the art institute of chicago then to london cologne west 
germany milan italy and finishes next year in paris

on the 80th day of the eastern airlines strike 
picketing machinists flight attendants and pilots at logan 
international airport shared a picnic lunch brought by a fellow 
striker 
that kind of camaraderie many eastern employees say has 
boosted their spirits and determination as the bitter strike nears 
the start of its fourth month 
its not easy but were doing the best we can eastern ramp 
service worker bob austin 43 said monday as he walked one of five 
picket lines that operate daily at logan 
im not spending much i havent been to a store in two 
months austin said but im optimistic i just hope the 
airline will be sold in one piece 
added 52yearold pilot ray chumsae im living on rainy day 
money and so far theres been a lot of rainy days 
the local machinists union has established a food and job bank 
that many strikers have used to procure parttime work that allows 
them to picket at least three times a week 
were still very solid and upbeat said william conley 
chief steward of the local machinists it helps to get all the 
support our hope is to keep eastern together 
eastern has been under chapter 11 protection from creditors 
since march 9 five days after the start of the paralyzing strike 
by machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight 
attendants 
a federal bankruptcy judge in new york must approve a sale of 
eastern or any of its assets 
this airline is not going to be sold in one piece thats been 
said over and over again eastern spokesman steve davis said 
but for the strikers its a terrible situation theres a 
terrible human price being paid we think its awful 
about half of easterns 2000 employees at logan have joined the 
walkout on average about 40 striking workers walk fourhour 
shifts before being replaced by fresh pickets 
the strikers exchange jokes as well as problems as they walk the 
picket lines which they have given nicknames 
we talk about whats going on and all the things that crop up 
because of this said baggage handler tom hogan 57 its kind 
of like a support group 
on monday strikers dined on pita bread sandwiches potato chips 
and soda on a bluechecked tablecloth spread on a grass island 
adjacent to the eastern terminal they call the area hollywood 
because it is the picket line of choice for television news camera 
crews 
theres a camaraderie about the whole issue said bj 
phillips 42 an eastern flight attendant for 23 years who said she 
was picketing at 6 am on the strikes first day people have 
really pitched in for each other 
phillips who brought the picnic hamper said some of the food 
was donated by friends in her hometown of carlisle 
but despite the optimism most of the strikers expressed anger 
and frustration much of toward frank lorenzo chairman of texas 
air corp easterns parent company 
most of us here love our jobs but theres something terribly 
wrong with the company said 57yearold pilot bill johansen a 
24year eastern veteran people here have stuck together but 
sometimes im amazed weve hung on

warner communications inc and time inc have 
set a june 23 date for shareholders to vote on a proposed 18 
billion merger that would create the worlds largest media and 
entertainment company 
the companies scheduled the votes monday after warner removed a 
potential obstacle to the merger by settling a dispute with its 
biggest shareholder chriscraft industries inc 
warner agreed to put its interest in chriscrafts broadcast 
subsidiary up for sale and relinquish its right of first refusal to 
buy chriscrafts sizeable holdings of warner stock should 
chriscraft decide to sell them 
we are delighted that despite our earlier differences the 
relationship between wci and chriscraft is ending on a 
constructive and amicable basis and in the best interests of all 
the shareholders of the concerned parties the chairmen and chief 
executives of both companies steven j ross of warner and herbert 
j siegel of chriscraft said in a statement 
despite the settlement chriscraft has not indicated whether it 
planned to sell its warner stake or how it planned to vote on the 
timewarner merger chriscraft owns about 171 percent of warners 
voting stock and would be the largest shareholder in a merged time 
warner with about 11 percent 
in new york stock exchange trading monday warner climbed 1 a 
share to 5137 time rose 75 cents a share to 12550 and 
chriscraft rose 112 a share to 38 
time and warner shareholders on record as of may 1 will be given 
a chance to vote on the merger at separate june 23 meetings 
under terms of the merger each share of warner stock would be 
traded for 0465 shares of stock in the new company while time 
shares would be exchanged on a oneforone basis 
several local cable franchising authorities also must approve 
the change in ownership of cable systems in their areas time owns 
systems with about 4 million subscribers while warner has about 15 
million cable subscribers 
warner and chriscraft struck an alliance in 1984 buying stakes 
of each other in what was seen as protection against hostile 
takeovers 
warner bought a 425 percent interest in chriscrafts broadcast 
subsidiary bhc inc while chriscraft bought a stake in warner 
as part of the agreement warner was forbidden from buying a 
television station or agreeing to certain changes in its control 
the relationship soon soured and warner gradually reduced 
chriscrafts representation on the warner board with mondays 
settlement chriscraft would no longer be represented on the 
warner board while warner would give up its spots on the bhc board 
warner spokesman geoffrey holmes said 
chriscraft delayed warners recent acquisition of lorimar 
telepictures inc forcing lorimar to sell television stations 
because of the pact with warner bhc owns or has interests in seven 
television stations 
in a move to head off potential delays warner filed suit 
earlier this month against chriscraft in delaware chancery court 
asking that chriscraft be required to resolve any objections to 
the merger that litigation was resolved under the settlement 
warner and chriscraft said 
peter m fishbein a chriscraft lawyer said the settlement 
gives chriscraft everything it asked for under its contract 
and more 
under the settlement warner said it would offer to sell its 
shares in bhc to third parties chriscraft would have the right of 
first refusal to purchase warners interest in bhc or require 
warner to spin off its interest in bhc to time warner shareholders 
after the merger 
warner also is ending its right of first refusal on sale of the 
warner shares held by chriscraft as part of the agreement 
fishbein said chriscraft got more than its contract called for 
when warner agreed that the spinoff of its bhc stake would be 
structured so as not to dilute chriscrafts own holdings in bhc 
chriscraft owns about 575 percent of bhc

declaring that business can be both 
profitable and ethical a group of industry leaders is launching an 
institute to study and foster responsible corporate behavior 
the business enterprise trust is the brainchild of television 
producer norman lear and is backed by executives including warren 
e buffett chairman of berkshire hathaway inc and washington 
post co chairwoman katharine graham 
the trust with offices at the claremont calif graduate 
school will make annual awards for exemplary acts or policies by 
business and sponsor research and hold seminars on business ethics 
the effort is aimed at business students and the business 
community said trust president kirk o hanson who for 10 years 
has headed the study of business ethics at stanford universitys 
graduate business school 
the skepticism which is growing in some business circles and 
among some business students that it is impossible to be both 
responsible and profitable is far off the mark hanson said 
examples of the kind of behavior that might be honored 
companies that operate ethically in countries with human rights 
abuses compete successfully with unethical rivals or that take 
responsibility for environmental or social problems associated with 
their businesses 
the trust will seek suggestions from the public beginning in 
september for the awards and will make the first award next year 
hanson said he expects to give five or six awards annually 
lear provided initial financing of 1 million for the first two 
years and other donors are being sought 
directors of the trust in addition to buffett and mrs graham 
are peter f drucker professor of social science at claremont

to china said monday that 36260 calls were attempted to china

government that it would use force if necessary to crush mass 
demonstrations in the chinese capital for political reform 
atampt said calling volume on its network started increasing about 
two weeks ago when the demonstrations began to grow the increase 
also coincided with an influx of foreign journalists and 
dignitaries accompanying soviet leader mikhail gorbachev on his 
visit to china 
the company said in a news release it was having no trouble 
delivering the calls although at peak times callers may reach a 
recording advising them that all circuits are busy

demand for most times of day and the company can add capacity by 
routing calls through tokyo

an investment group led by the former chairman 
of macmillan inc has agreed to buy the publishing giants direct 
marketing business as well as magazine operations macmillan once 
owned for a total of 310 million 
the purchases are the first by kiii holdings inc which is 
headed by former macmillan chairman edward p evans and macmillans 
former chief financial officer charles g mccurdy 
kiii holdings was formed in february in association with the 
investment banker kohlberg kravis roberts amp co to acquire 
acquiring and manage businesses in the publishing information and 
media fields 
evans had headed a macmillan management group backed by kohlberg 
that last year lost a bitter takeover struggle for macmillan 
britains robert maxwell won that fight and paid 25 billion 
for macmillan which is based in new york evans left the company 
after the takeover 
on monday maxwell communication corp said it had agreed to 
sell macmillans direct marketing group to kiii holdings for 143 
million 
that business includes macmillan book clubs and gryphon 
editions and mainly is involved in operating professional and 
scientific book clubs 
the direct marketing group had earnings from operations of 16 
million on sales of 85 million last year maxwell said 
kiii holdings announced separately it also would acquire the 
assets of intertec publishing co and webb publishing from a 
privatelyheld group which bought them from macmillan late last 
year for an undisclosed price 
intertec and webb publish magazines in the broadcasting 
engineering telecommunication horticultural and farming 
industries as well as technical manuals 
kiii holdings did not say how much it paid for intertec and 
webb but gave an aggregate price for the two transactions of 310 
million considering the price maxwell gave for the direct 
marketing group sale the price for intertec and webb apparently 
was about 167 million 
maxwell had agreed last last year to sell the book clubs along 
with intertec and webb for 400 million to another group aligned 
with kohlberg kravis but that deal fell apart when it became 
apparent it would not be completed in time to qualify for tax 
breaks that expired at the end of 1988 
maxwell said its sale of the direct marketing group would be for 
cash payable on completion of the deal expected to occur june 30 
it said the proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings 
maxwell already has announced about 14 billion of the 2 
billion in asset sales it expects to make in the wake of its 
macmillan acquisition 
last week maxwell said macmillan had agreed to sell its 
katherine gibbs secretarial training programs and its technical 
schools division for 315 million to phillips colleges a 
privatelyheld concern based in gulfport miss

american airlines is expected to announce orders 
and options wednesday for 150 commuter planes from a swedish 
manufacturer in a deal that could be worth as much as 1 billion a 
published report said today 
the dallas times herald reported in todays editions that the 
orders would be placed with saabscania 
american has scheduled a news conference wednesday at company 
headquarters in fort worth to announce the acquisition of a 
significant number of aircraft said ed stewart an airline 
spokesman 
the airline the principal holding of amr corp is expected to 
announce an order for 50 saabscania 340b turboprop commuter 
aircraft options for 50 more and 50 options for the larger 
saabscania 2000 model said paul turk an analyst for avmark a 
washington dc consulting firm 
analysts quoted by the newspaper said the purchases are 
expected to end a multibilliondollar buying binge the airline 
launched in the past year to position itself for growth in the 
1990s 
americans strategy is to have the flexibility to take 
additional aircraft during periods of high demand or use them to 
retire aging planes if the industrys growth slows robert 
crandall company chairman and chief executive officer said last 
week 
analysts said the carrier has one of the industrys youngest 
fleets with an average age of 94 years that average is expected 
to decrease to eight years by 1994 they said 
the airlines officials said they are now entering a second 
phase of faster growth to take advantage of a closing window of 
opportunity as regulatory and capacity problems place limits on 
future growth

cable television must provide more quality and not 
just quantity in programming key executives say 
in the opening session of the national cable television 
associations annual meeting monday industry executives said the 
rapid expansion of the cable market necessitates a clear focus for 
future programming 
today we are clearly a major source of television in 
america said bob miron ncta vice chairman and president of 
newhouse broadcasting corp 
james p mooney nctas president and chief executive cited 
recent polls which indicate the public believes cable provides 
superior programming in cultural childrens sports and general 
entertainment areas 
for several years now it has become more and more apparent 
that cable has drawn even with broadcasting as a primary 
television medium mooney said moreover cable is not just 
more tv it is different it is diverse it is special 
to the degree that there is a real diversity in television 
programming which didnt exist 10 years ago to the degree that 
national audiences of children women minorities arts lovers 
sports enthusiasts and people interested in public affairs now have 
available allday intelligently conceived and well produced 
programming to meet their needs it is cable thats made the 
difference mooney said 
other executives like former nbc president fred silverman say 
its time cable tv develops a conscience and develop its potential 
silverman said the cable industry has had a proliferation of 
tabloid tv shows like americas most wanted and talk shows 
like geraldo 
i think its horrible said silverman who now heads his own 
production firm silverman predicted the popularity of such shows 
has peaked and said backlash from the public will bring about 
their demise by next year 
since the mid70s when cable began to expand beyond a 
transmission service to include original programming more than 55 
percent of the nations estimated 89 million television homes now 
pay an average of 1460 per month for basic service which 
includes an average of 35 channels the association says 
during that time overtheair networks share of the television 
has declined as the public has turned to viewing alternatives 
including cable and videotapes 
about 77 million of the nations homes have access to cable 
goddard said adding that studies indicate more than 25 percent of 
the television watched in homes with cable is nonnetwork 
programming

procter amp gamble co says it will sell 
its northern michigan paper factory and drop production of the 
tissue used in disposable diapers 
mosinee paper corp of wisconsin has agreed in principle to buy 
the cheboygan factory procter amp gamble plant manager phil baker 
said monday 
the plant manufactures the tissue paper that wraps around the 
absorbent stuffing of disposable diapers and also makes liners for 
underwear and incontinent briefs about a third of the plants 
production is devoted to diaper tissue baker said 
the cheboygan plant employs 305 people it employed as many as 
700 people 10 years ago when pampg manufactured pampers diapers 
there 
the company wanted to sell the plant and transfer the 
manufacture of its liners and briefs to other pampg plants said 
spokeswoman sue hale at corporate headquarters in cincinnati 
there are some savings in distribution overhead and such 
costs she said of the planned sale it was purely an economic 
move 
the company will stop making the tissue for diapers altogether 
buying it on the open market instead basically we were able to 
identify a supplier that we could obtain the tissue from at a 
savings hale said 
baker said design changes over the years have reduced the amount 
of tissue needed in each diaper reducing demand and making it 
cheaper to buy than make 
mosinee which produces industrial tissue and towel products and 
specialty papers uses different raw materials and sells to a 
different market baker said 
the sale will be final in march 1990 but pampg will continue 
manufacturing there until the fall of 1990 baker said no sale 
price was disclosed 
the sale hinges on mosinee reaching a labor agreement with the 
united paperworkers international union which has a contract with 
pampg that expires this fall no negotiations have begun 
before the sale is final mosinee also must receive state 
permits to discharge treated water into the cheboygan river 
the paper mill opened in 1906 and has had a long succession of 
owners including the simplicity pattern co and the charmin paper 
co

circle k corps chairman says he may try to buy 
out the conveniencestore chain but analysts say karl ellers 
announcement may have been a ploy to encourage early bidding from 
others 
the phoenixbased company announced monday it was looking for 
buyers and eller chairman and chief operating officer advised 
circle ks board of directors he may attempt a leveraged buyout 
im sure theres some poker involved here said dennis 
telzrow vice president of research at eppler guerin amp turner 
inc in dallas 
christopher vroom an analyst with alex brown amp sons inc in 
baltimore said ellers announcement creates a sense of urgency 
in the minds of any potential buyer of circle k if they want to 
buy circle k theyd better step up to the plate now 
circle ks profits have fallen and the companys longterm debt 
is nearly 1 billion caused by agressive expansion the arizona 
business gazette reported monday 
since eller became chairman in 1983 the company has grown from 
1221 stores in 11 states to a total of 4687 outlets in 33 states 
only 450 of those were built by circle k the rest were purchased 
in a series of acquisitions 
the company bought several smaller conveniencestore chains 
between 1983 and 1986 then last year acquired 473 7eleven stores 
from dallasbased southland corp incurring a 170 million debt 
it also last year acquired 538 charter marketing co convenience 
stores for 70 million in cash and a new issue of convertible 
preferred stock 
to finance the buys the company negotiated a 500 million loan 
250 million in longterm financing and 250 million in a revolving 
credit line with a group of banks 
the company said in a statement monday that it had received some 
interest in possible acquisitions but no specific offers 
analysts disagreed on whether circle k likely would be bought by 
a major oil company of the 4687 convenience stores the company 
operates 3600 have gas pumps 
circle ks statement also said the company would continue to 
study possible dispositions of selected assets and other ways of 
gaining capital 
a statement from the company said the loss comes from pressure 
on gasoline and general merchandise margins during the first two 
months of the year 
circle k operates 4687 convenience stores in 33 states and more 
than 1000 licensed or joint venture operations in 11 foreign 
countries

pan am corp continues to seek financing to 
acquire northwest airlines parent company but has decided not to 
sign an agreement that would give it access to nwa incs financial 
records 
the confidentiality agreement which provides wouldbe suitors 
with sensitive data in exchange for a pledge not to accumulate 
stock or talk with labor was too restrictive pan am chairman 
thomas g plaskett said monday in a letter delivered to the nwa 
board 
a pan am spokesperson said plaskett believes that as a 
competitor his airline already has sufficient knowledge of 
northwests operation and financial condition to make a judgment 
about a possible offer industry experts estimate that it will take 
approximately 35 billion to acquire northwest 
pan am remains free to meet with northwest airlines unions 
whose cooperation is considered key to any successful bid and 
retains the option to pursue a hostile tender in which it would 
offer to buy all outstanding shares of nwas stock 
pan am says it will continue to cooperate with nwas bidding 
procedure which sets a may 30 deadline for offers to buy the 
company 
we fully intend to adhere to their timetable pan am 
spokeswoman pamela hanlon said 
she also said plaskett does not intend to meet with northwests 
unions unless he has the approval and permission of northwest 
meanwhile plaskett embarked on a crosscountry trip monday 
night to round up potential investors for pan ams bid to acquire 
northwest 
plasketts attempt to acquire northwest is considered a long 
shot but having the support of labor or an agreement that would 
minimize merger disruptions would make it easier for pan am to 
obtain financial commitments from lenders 
at least one other potential bidder a group led by los angeles 
investor al checchi has indicated a desire to speak to the 
companys unions checchis group however has signed the 
confidentiality agreement that prohibits it from making such 
contact 
on wall street northwests stock jumped 175 a share to 
10387 monday amid a growing sense that bids for the company 
would be in the 110 to 115 range pan ams stock dropped 12 
cents to 437 
pan am executives and prudentialbache securities the companys 
financial adviser will be in the twin cities on wednesday to try 
to interest investment and money management firms in the interim 
financing needed to swing a purchase 
mike hamilton an analyst with piper jaffray amp hopwood in 
minneapolis attributed the rise in nwa stock to the distribution 
of the offering circular for pan ams interim financing to the 
investment community and to some speculation that pan am may be 
moving towards a hostile tender 
but hamilton said that if pan am does decide to make a bid its 
chances are slim whether it is friendly or hostile analysts have 
pointed out that while a combination of pan am and northwest would 
create a megacarrier with few overlapping routes pan ams 
financial troubles make it an unattractive suitor 
pan am said last week that its principal backers prudential 
bache and the airlie group are willing to invest at least 400 
million

thrifty rentacar system inc which is in 
an agreement to be acquired by chrysler corp has agreed to buy 
ohiobased snappy car rental inc for 40 million 
chrysler financed part of the snappy acquisition announced 
monday said meloyde blancettscott spokeswoman for thrifty 
the automaker said last week it had agreed to acquire the 
tulsabased thrifty for 263 million 
snappy car rental has an excellent name and reputation in the 
insurance replacement segment of the car rental industry and will 
continue to operate separately under the snappy brand name said 
thrifty chairman william e lobeck jr 
snappy specializes in insurance replacement rentals and employs 
about 1600 people 
founded in 1973 snappy has 20000 cars operating from 250 
locations after reporting profits for five years snappy expects 
to report a net loss of 134 million for its fiscal year ended 
march 31 
the loss was primarily because of its activity in the airport 
segment of the daily car rental market ms blancettscott said 
the company is refocusing on the insurance replacement market 
what that means is that if you wreck your car and your 
insurance company agrees to a replacement while your car is being 
repaired it would come from snappy ms blancettscott said 
in the daily rental market the customer typically wants a new 
car and they want to be able to pick it up 24 hours a day she 
said 
in the car replacement market she said people generally accept 
older cars and the rates are 35 percent to 50 percent less than 
the daily rate 
thrifty is the fifth largest car rental network in north america 
in number of locations with more than 650 locations in 23 
countries and an average fleet size of more than 33000 vehicles 
no date has been set for completion of the snappy acquisition

the state department of labor has ordered 
nissan motor manufacturing usa to release worker injury records 
that have become the focus of a united auto workers organizing 
drive at the companys plant 
the uaw passed out flyers monday detailing the workers attempts 
to examine the records before a vote over whether the uaw will 
represent 2400 production and maintenance workers at nissans only 
us plant 
two workers said they were told they could not see the log 
200 records even though they showed a supervisor the occupational 
safety and health administration regulations that said they had 
that right 
thomas grooms nissans manager of employee relations was 
ordered to release the records after a union lawyer complained 
nancy mcnulty spokeswoman for the state labor department said 
today 
we instructed him that according to state law they are 
required to provide availability to any employee former employee 
or to their representatives for examination and copying in a 
reasonable manner at reasonable times she said 
nissan has 30 days to respond to the order ms mcnulty said 
gail o neuman nissan vice president of human resources and 
chief legal counsel said earlier that nissan would decide within a 
month whether to release the records 
the union said it has its reasons for examining the logs 
wed like to identify the areas where theyre having the most 
injuries so that when we win this election we can go in there and 
negotiate over that said jim weaver international uaw 
representative and coordinator of the nissan campaign 
nissan and the uaw differ sharply over worker safety the union 
says high assembly line speed causes carpal tunnel syndrome 
injuries to nerves and tendons in the hand and wrist along with 
back and shoulder injuries 
ms neuman cited the latest national safety council figures 
which show an automotive industry average illness and injury rate 
of 258 per 100 workers in 1987 nissans rate was 89 per 100 
during that period 
uaw spokesman maxey irwin said workers need to examine the log 
200 records to make sure nissan is reporting all its injuries 
theyre ignoring these employees irwin said they want to 
feel that they can go to work and leave there without being 
mutilated 
the uaw filed a qualifying petition thursday asking the national 
labor relations board to conduct an election to determine if 
nissans hourly workers want to be represented by the uaw

an attorney contends in a lawsuit that state 
farm has built up too big a surplus in premium dollars and asks the 
court to order the company to return 69 billion to its customers 
nationwide 
william shernoff a former president of the california trial 
lawyers association who frequently appears in court against 
insurers filed the lawsuit monday in superior court 
he contends that bloomington illbased state farm holds nearly 
1 in surplus for every premium dollar far in excess of what he 
calls the industry standard of about 1 in surplus for every 2 in 
premiums 
state farm is pursuing a bizarre policy of accumulating 
more and more surplus by refusing to distribute reasonable 
dividends and by plowing its extra premium and investment income 
back into the surplus thus compounding the problem said 
shernoff 
but state farm had recently rebutted suggestions it was holding 
too large a surplus in california suggesting that distributing 
surplus funds would only mean higher insurance prices later 
thats about all we can say at this point jim stahly a 
spokesman for state farm mutual automobile insurance co said 
tuesday adding that the company had not received the lawsuit 
its difficult to defend on a pointbypoint basis until we see 
something like that 
he said that as a mutual company state farm is owned by its 
policyholders so cannot go to stockholders to expand 
he did say that the surplus label of the fund does not mean 
excess or unnecessary but is held to protect policyholders 
insurance companies hold funds in surplus against the 
eventuality of claims

hasbro inc officials declined comment 
tuesday on published reports that hasbro the worlds biggest 
toymaker would buy most of coleco industries inc under a plan to 
be presented in bankruptcy court 
the hartford courant said tuesday that sources close to 
avonbased colecos 10monthold bankruptcy case told the newspaper 
that details of the plan still were being negotiated 
barry alperin executive vice president of hasbro inc declined 
to comment on the report saying the companies were forbidden from 
discussing the case in public by an order last month from us 
bankruptcy court in new york 
a secretary for colecos chairman morton handel said he would 
be away from his office all day she declined to say where he could 
be contacted 
representatives of hasbro coleco and colecos creditors are 
scheduled to appear wednesday in bankruptcy court in new york to 
discuss the plan 
the deal expected to be announced wednesday would strengthen 
hasbros position in the toy business by adding such wellknown 
coleco items as cabbage patch kids and scrabble and parcheesi board 
games to its product lines 
while many details are unknown sources told the courant that 
the deal would provide that 
much of coleco would be sold to hasbro but it could not be 
determined whether pawtucket ribased company would buy all of 
coleco or just most of its assets if coleco is sold it would end 
57 years as an independent company 
colecos committee of unsecured creditors would drop its 71 
million lawsuit against the companys largest creditors new york 
businessmen isaac perlmutter and bernard marden 
perlmutter and marden in turn would reduce their 80 million 
claim against coleco by an undetermined amount 
the lawsuit contends that perlmutter and marden who are secured 
creditors cheated coleco out of millions of dollars through a 
complex scheme of trading television advertising time for products 
the deal would be a victory for colecos unsecured creditors 
because a reduced claim by perlmutter and marden means more money 
would be available to repay them the newspaper said coleco had 
debts of 5403 million when it filed for protection from its 
creditors under the bankruptcy laws in july 
coleco grew to be one of the nations largest toy companies 
during the past decade propelled in large part by its cabbage 
patch kids dolls 
but demand for the dolls dropped beginning in 1986 and coleco 
was not successful at introducing new products to make up for the 
lost sales the company sought bankruptcy court protection last 
year 
coleco filed its first reorganization plan in late january 
detailing how it planned to repay creditors but that proposal 
immediately was rejected by the creditors committee which said it 
provided inadequate payment and appeared to favor perlmutter and 
mardens interests over the committees 
the plan would have given perlmutter and marden 55 percent of 
the stock of a reorganized coleco and a note for 40 million in 
cash creditors would have received about 36 percent of coleco 
stock and no cash a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every 1 
they are owed 
in march coleco said it was considering selling the company 
outright to resolve its financial problems 
a few weeks later however the company reversed itself and said 
it would instead propose a new reorganization plan offering a 
larger repayment to creditors consisting of about 10 cents for 
every 1 of debt plus 37 percent of colecos stock 
coleco had not yet filed that new plan with the bankruptcy court 
when creditors announced april 19 that they had negotiated a deal 
to sell most of coleco to hasbro for more than 85 million in cash

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower tuesday in subdued trading on the chicago board of trade as 
the market continues to be influenced by the weather and the steady 
rise in the value of the dollar 
improving weather and slack demand for corn and soybeans are 
affecting prices said rich feltes an analyst for refco inc in 
chicago 
as the value of the dollar rose soybeans broke more said 
feltes of todays action in the pits whether the connection with 
the dollar is real or psychological it is having an effect but 
the weather continues to have the most influence on prices 
the dollars rally of the past few weeks sparked a selloff of 
all commodities monday amid concerns overseas sales of grain will 
be choked off by the dollars rise in value 
prices rose in early trading on a belief that mondays selloff 
was a little bit overdone said dale gustafson an analyst with 
drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
a weaker dollar early tuesday provided some support to corn and 
soybean prices at the start of trading but prices trailed off on 
prospects of further rain in crop areas 
at the close wheat was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 395 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 4 cents lower with july at 264 a bushel oats were a cent 
to 1 cents lower with july at 175 a bushel soybeans were 8 
cents lower to 5 cents higher with july at 699 a bushel

the united states will continue to subsidize sales 
of farm products under its export enhancement program so it can 
keep up with the european community us agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said tuesday 
the subsidies are paid on sales made under the export 
enhancement program and they are the best way to deal with the 
european community subsidies yeutter told reporters after a 
meeting with agriculture minister don mazankowski the ministers 
hold several meetings every year 
earlier this month the united states announced the subsidized 
sale of 300000 tons of wheat to the soviet union the sales could 
eventually reach 15 million tons 
canadian officials suggested the sale violated at least the 
spirit of an agreement by member countries of the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade or gatt as the international trade referee is 
usually called the agreement covers principles for an 
international agriculture trade code 
the agreement called on members not to increase subsidized sales 
yeutter said the united states doesnt like export subsidies 
more than anyone else while we hope well be able to stop using 
them we dont have a lot of choice for now but to live with them 
otherwise we would be handing all of the world trade to the 
europeans on a platter 
canada has been campaigning against subsidized sales of farm 
goods because it cant afford to match the subsidies and because 
they tend to lower prices canadian farmers can get for their 
exports 
mazankowski said he also raised objections to a new 
countervailing duty on canadian pork shipments to the united states 
and defended new canadian import restrictions on ice cream and 
yogurt 
mazankowski said he told yeutter that the basis of the decision 
to slap a duty on shipments of canadian fresh chilled and frozen 
pork goes against gatt principles 
mazankowski said that if the duty isnt dropped canada will 
take the case to gatt

stock prices declined today amid uncertainty 
about the dollar interest rates and the economys growth 
the stock market opened lower after a strongerthanexpected 
durable goods report for april that suggested the pace of economic 
growth might not be slowing as predicted 
the commerce department reported that orders to factories for 
bigticket durable goods such as airplanes climbed 29 percent 
in april the strongest increase in four months in march durable 
goods orders rose just 1 percent a figure the market expected to 
be repeated last month 
analysts said the report provided further evidence that the us 
industrial sector is strong despite some weakness in other areas 
the figure was above street expectations said hildegarde 
zagorski analyst with prudentialbache securities inc it 
suggests the economy is picking up steam again if it gets too 
strong it raises inflationary fears again 
traders said the report raised concern that inflation also could 
mean the federal reserve would not move to ease credit anytime soon 
the recent strong rise in the dollar had led to speculation that 
the fed might lower interest rates to stem the currencys upward 
momentum 
a decline in the dollar could lead to lower stock prices because 
it would dampen demand by foreign investors for dollardenominated 
assets

the national transportation safety board laid 
the major blame today on aloha airlines maintenance program for 
failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19yearold 
boeing 737 that split open over hawaii slightly more than a year 
ago 
after a daylong meeting the board concluded that alohas 
management failed to supervise maintenance of its aging fleet 
properly the board also blamed the federal aviation administration 
for improperly assessing the airlines inspection program and 
issuing inadequate orders for ensuring the safety of older 
airliners 
the board said alohas maintenance operations failed to detect 
the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage on the 
surface of the fuselage 
the board criticized the faa for failing to order replacement of 
rivets along joints in the 737s outer skin much earlier than it 
did 
board member joseph nall dissented from the fivemember boards 
decision saying he wanted blame to be more widely spread for the 
failure of the aviation system to deal earlier with the problem of 
aging airliners 
earlier today metallurgist james wildey told the board that a 
3footby4foot piece of metal skin from the airplane showed it 
had been repaired but still contained cracks that were missed by 
airline mechanics before the april 28 1988 accident 
the accident has led to sweeping changes including required 
replacements of parts in the maintenance of airliner fleets 
worldwide 
a stewardess was killed when she was sucked out through an 
18foot hole in the planes fuselage but the pilot managed to land 
the airline safely at kahului airport on maui with 94 other people 
aboard sixtyone passengers and crew members were injured the 
plane had been flying at 24000 feet en route from hilo to honolulu 
when the section of fuselage ripped off 
wildey a board staff member said evidence showed that 
inspection for possible cracks by airline mechanics required on 
all early 737s was either not performed or performed 
ineffectively 
the piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue 
cracks that were underneath the repair patches between the repair 
patches and on either side of the repair patches wildey said 
chief investigator barry trotter described the harrowing 
incident saying the captain observed that the cockpitcabin door 
was gone and there was blue sky where the ceiling had been 
he said the board staff drew up 24 recommendations arising from 
the accident for airlines boeing and the faa the recommendations 
were not disclosed immediately 
the safety board staff examined the role of metal fatigue 
aircraft design the airlines maintenance program crew 
performance and faa directives affecting the aircraft which had 
logged nearly 90000 flights 
the aloha investigation which was kept confidential up to 
todays meeting was based on inspection of the plane interviews 
public hearings and other data 
the accident focused worldwide attention on the issue of aging 
airliners and led to several faa orders for inspections and 
modifications the average age of inservice airliners exceeds 13 
years and jetliners are rarely retired as the demand for air 
travel increases and orders for new jets have to be made years in 
advance 
a series of faa directives stepping up inspections and ordering 
some modifications of older aircraft followed the aloha incident 
the faa cited the accident last week when it issued a 
farreaching series of airworthiness directives changing the way 
all older boeingbuilt airliners will be kept safe the directives 
give airlines four years to replace parts and make other 
modifications on boeing 727s 737s and 747s that either reach 20 
years of age or a set number of takeoffs for each model 
before the orders which are set to become final by late summer 
were issued airlines were required to make periodic inspections 
replacing parts only when they showed signs of excessive wear 
four months before the aloha accident an indepth faa 
inspection found that aloha did not have an adequate system for 
complying with faa directives and properly maintaining its planes 
the faa had warned airlines to check for corroding fasteners 
that hold pieces of the fuselage together and had ordered close 
inspection of the upper skin of the early 737s because routine 
inspections had turned up cracks in some planes 
aloha had said it complied with faa maintenance orders before 
the incident and had found nothing unusual in inspection of the 
plane that tore open 
after the accident investigators said they found minute cracks 
where the 18foot hole in the fuselage apparently started

the market is sort of catching its breath here but theres

seeing a pause right now said william p sterling an 
international economist with merrill lynch capital markets

discount rate or the interest it charges on loans to commercial 
banks and that the fed might ease us rates both to stem the 
dollars rise

currency stabilization initiative by the united states and its six 
major trading partners known as the group of seven 
the dollar rose sharply on monday smashing the 2mark level for 
the first time in 2 years and hitting a 1year high vs the yen 
due largely to perceived weakness among the g7 in foreignexchange 
policies

on either side of the water said ronald h holzer chief 
currency dealer with harris trust amp co in chicago until then 
well be trading off the rumors

factor to be considered in monetary policymaking and he gave no 
gave indication the central bank was considering easing credit to 
depress the dollar

29 percent in april the best showing in four months and further

crude oil futures prices rose in brisk trading 
tuesday on speculation opec members may maintain their current 
production levels and benchmark price 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the major grade of us crude settled at 
1904 a 42gallon barrel up 43 cents the june contract expired

fridays close 
prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later than july all 
posted gains 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale home 
heating oil for delivery in june rose 052 of a cent to 4750 cents 
a gallon after falling 108 cents on monday the june contract for 
unleaded gasoline rose 034 cent to 6424 cents a gallon following 
mondays decline of 129 cents 
analysts said crude demand was sparked by new theories about the 
possible outcome of next months meeting of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
the latest speculation centered on the possibility the cartel 
may decide against adjusting its output ceiling and altering its 
18abarrel benchmark price when members gather in vienna on june 
5 
previous reports have indicated various cartel members are 
producing above their selfimposed output targets 
andrew lebow a broker with edampf man international futures 
inc said a comment by kuwaiti oil minister sheikh ali khalifa al 
sabah appeared aimed at playing down a report monday which 
suggested kuwait might increase production unilaterally if the 
cartel didnt agree to grant it a larger share of the overall 
output quota

the stock market fell in moderate trading 
tuesday as the market took a breather amid concern about the 
dollars strength and the pace of economic growth 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 2401 points to 
finish the day at 247801 
declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 8 to 5 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
938 issues down 594 up and 469 unchanged 
the stock market opened lower after a strongerthanexpected 
durable goods report for april 
the commerce department reported that orders to factories for 
bigticket items such as aircraft and machinery climbed 29 
percent in april the strongest increase in four months in march 
durable goods orders rose just 1 percent a figure the market 
expected to be repeated in april 
the increase reflected renewed demand in all major industries 
after broadbased weakness in the first quarter and despite some 
slackening off in other sectors 
no matter how you break it up it is a strong report said 
thomas f carpenter economist for asb capital management the 
industrial sector has remained resilient to higher interest rates 
and from this point forward it is not at all clear that the 
economy will weaken in fact it indicates the economy will firm 
some analysts said however that the durable goods report was 
an excuse for predictable profittaking after a nineweek rally 
the primary reason for the selloff is weve come a long way 
in nine weeks the selling was not nasty it did not get out of 
hand said alfred e goldman market analyst with ag edwards amp 
sons inc it was more profittaking and a buyers strike 
early in the day when the us currency softened slightly 
against the japanese yen and west german mark investors worried 
that a slide in the dollar could drive away foreign investors 
but the dollar resumed its advance after midday and that helped 
send prices lower 
the dollar has been making people feel more comfortable 
goldman said but now it has gotten a bit too strong in a 
vulnerable market that raises questions about what thats going to 
do to the trade deficit 
analysts said however that tuesdays weakness reflected only a 
brief pause and that the dominant trend in the stock market is 
still upward 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 18769 million 
shares up from 18501 million in mondays session except for a 
few meek attempts to rally trading activity remained moderate 
traders said 
thomas walsh head of equity trading for nikko securities 
international said political turmoil in china and panama also may 
have impacted the market

the dollar showed just enough weakness early tuesday to give a 
boost to gold and silver futures prices on new yorks commodity 
exchange but platinum prices retreated as demand for the metal 
ebbs 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mostly lower 
livestock prices were higher and pork futures mixed and energy 
prices climbed 
the dollar continues to exert its influence on precious metals 
but in a positive manner as gold and silver prices gained for the 
first time in days 
gold settled 50 cents to 110 higher with the contract for 
delivery in june at 36430 a troy ounce silver was 67 cents to 7 
cents higher with may at 5173 a troy ounce 
buying interest reflected a weaker dollar early in the day and 
indications the administration may want to put a lid on the 
dollar said stephen platt an analyst with dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago the dollars comeback to be higher on the day 
touched off some profit taking 
platinum particularly weak because of pressure from overseas 
selling was 830 to 910 lower with july at 48920 a troy ounce 
platt said investors were disappointed the japanese were not 
doing aggressive buying of the metal primarily used in the 
manufacture of automobile pollution control devices 
copper prices were forced lower on the comex on technical 
trading as prices broke through several price support levels 
triggering additional selling
