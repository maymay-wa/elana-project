president bush on tuesday told visiting 
pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto that the united states is 
willing to explore any serious avenue to achieve a political 
solution in afghanistan 
mrs bhutto in turn said after private talks with the president 
that we are in complete accord on the situation in afghanistan 
stalemated since the pullout of the last soviet troops in february 
bush said the withdrawal of the red army proved the effectiveness 
of uspakistani support for the afghan resistance fighting the 
marxist regime in kabul pakistan shares a common border with 
afghanistan 
we agreed however that the job is not done said bush 
the mujahedeen continues and their struggle for selfdetermination 
goes on 
prime minister bhutto and i discussed ways to encourage a 
political solution in afghanistan that will lead to a nonaligned 
representative government willing to live in peace with its 
neighbors to replace the illegitimate regime in kabul said bush 
the united states and pakistan will continue to explore any 
serious avenue towards this end 
us officials had anticipated a rapid demise for the government 
of najibullah after the soviet pullout but it has not happened 
mrs bhutto said she and bush have reviewed the situation in 
the light of the prevailing circumstances and we are in complete 
accord on what needs to be done 
pakistan remains committed to a political solution of the 
afghan problem whereby the brave people of afghanistan will have 
the right to freely choose their own government without interference 
from outside she said 
mrs bhutto the daughter of former prime minister ali bhutto 
said that while the soviet pullout has brought a welcome change in 
afghanistan the continued fighting and prolonged presence of over 
35 million afghan refugees pose serious threats to the peace and 
stability of the region 
after a fulldress military ceremony on the white house lawn 
including a 19gun salute and an oval office meeting with bush 
mrs bhutto went to the state department for a meeting with 
secretary of state james a baker iii and a lunch in her honor 
at a state dinner tuesday evening bush joked during the exchange 
of toasts that mrs bhutto had refused my latest offer shes not 
going double or nothing on this years harvardyale game 
keeping up the ivy league banter mrs bhutto responded ladies 
and gentlemen i studied at harvard and believe me i didnt know 
until tonight that yale ever produced charming men im glad i met 
the only one 
mrs bhutto is a 1973 harvard graduate bush is a 1948 graduate 
of archrival yale 
pakistan has a standing request to buy 60 more f16 fighter jets 
from the united states bush brushed aside reporters attempts to 
ask about reports that approval of the jet sale is imminent 
an administration official briefing reporters at the white 
house said bush and mrs bhutto discussed the f16 sale but i 
wouldnt anticipate any specific announcement from outside during 
her visit the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
indicated there were no stumbling blocks to the sale but normal 
steps such as congressional notification would take more time 
on another topic bush said mrs bhutto assured me that 
pakistans nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes 
he said he underlined his commitment to discourage 
proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons ballistic missiles 
in the south asia region and around the world 
in an interview with editors of the washington post mrs bhutto 
said she had very frank talk with bush and cia director william 
webster and assured them pakistan does not intend to build nuclear 
weapons 
she said she wanted bush to help pakistan reach a nuclear 
testban treay with other countries in the region an apparent 
reference to longti8me rival india according to a report on the 
interview in wednesday editions 
india exploded what it called a nuclear device in 1974 
webster last month said pakistan clearly was developing nuclear 
capability and indian appeared interested in developing 
thermonculear weapons 
the two leaders also discussed efforts to combat drug production 
and trafficking bush said he applauded her tough stance on 
eradicating the opium cultivation and thanked her for extraditing 
an alleged drug trafficker 
the two countries were expected to sign agreements on housing 
narcotics and education this week during bhuttos stay pakistan 
the third largest recipient of us aid is slated for 380 million 
in economic assistance and 240 million in military aid next year 
mrs bhuttos father was deposed by gen mohammad zia ulhaq in 
1977 and hanged two years later for a political murder zia remained 
in power until perishing in a mysterious plane crash last year that 
also claimed the life of us ambassador arnold raphel and an 
american general 
mrs bhutto who had picked up her fathers fallen standard and 
been jailed for a time under zia led her pakistan peoples party to 
victory as head of a coalition government last november 
mrs bhutto was scheduled to address a joint session of congress 
on wednesday she also had stops here at the world bank and 
international monetary fund she will receive an honorary degree at 
her alma mater harvard university on thursday and visit the united 
nations on friday she departs for home saturday evening

military sales to china the toughest measures announced by the 
many countries protesting beijings military crackdown on 
demonstrators that left hundreds of people dead

place as long as those responsible for the atrocities remain in 
control of the chinese government 
howe also said britain will not allow mass immigration from the 
colony of hong kong due to be handed over to china in 1997 he said 
an open door policy could more than double the ethnic minority 
population of the united kingdom 
prime minister margaret thatcher said earlier that about 35 
million hong kong chinese eligible for british passports will not be 
given the right of residence in britain but britain will show 
greater flexibility about immigration from hong kong 
she expressed utter revulsion at the chinese crackdown and 
said we will be thinking how best to demonstrate that in 
practical ways 
howe announced britain immediately is banning arms sales to china 
due to the slaughter of innocent people and banned military 
contacts and visits by senior chinese officials 
the defense ministry refused to say what arms britain sells to 
china but the britains independent television said sales amounted 
to 468 million a year 
washington sells china more than 600 million of military 
equipment a year and private us dealers do about 85 million 
worth of military sales with beijing

the 12nation european economic community strongly condemned the 
chinese action and appealed to authorities to stop using force but 
it did not propose any joint protest measures

monday by withdrawing deposits from bank of china branches a crowd 
formed outside the bank where a senior official said three to four

immediately flew out tuesday and 200 more were to leave on a 
special flight wednesday a spokesman for the canadian embassy in 
beijing said

said further flights were planned pending permission from chinese 
authorities 
new zealand and switzerland also hired jets for evacuations

in moscow members of the congress of peoples deputies called on 
chinas leaders to use wisdom reason and a weighted approach 
but did not denounce the violence the soviet foreign ministry has 
made no comment the two communist giants are trying to mend fences 
after decades of estrangement

embassies in stockholm sweden madrid spain abu dhabi united 
arab emirates belgrade yugoslavia the hague in the netherlands 
athens greeceother and other cities 
in johannesburg south africa the progovernment newspaper the 
citizen questioned why south africa is the target of international 
boycotts when whatever faults we have are tiny by comparison 
to the horror of the massacre of beijing 
east german state newspapers indirectly took sides with the 
chinese governments use of force 
the junge welt newspaper appealed to east germans not to believe 
media reports that bore the viewpoint of western politics and 
gave good grades to those holding out in tiananmen square to 
protest the government and bad grades to those calling for calm and 
reconciliation

ahmad khomeini has emerged from the long 
shadow of his father and appears to be making a bid for power 
himself a move some analysts believe is doomed to fail 
he was making his moves even before ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
died saturday but the death of irans revolutionary and spiritual 
patriarch before the leadership issue could be settled has added 
urgency to the sons campaign 
a lot of emotions are rampant in iran now shahram chubin an 
iran specialist with the graduate institute of international studies 
in geneva said in a telephone interview 
some people will be trying to take advantage of that and ahmad 
is one of them 
the assembly of experts the body formed in 1979 to ensure a 
smooth transition after khomeinis death on sunday named president 
ali khamenei as a caretaker leader until the succession is resolved 
in the meantime rivals in tehran are jockeying for power 
although ahmad khomeini is only a middleranking cleric or 
hojatoleslam and holds no official title he was one of his 
fathers closest advisers 
as khomeinis private secretary he controlled access to the 
reclusive patriarch and wielded considerable influence behind the 
scenes 
the younger khomeini 43 took an increasingly high public 
profile as his fathers health declined 
he has allied himself with radical figures in the hierarchy in 
the power struggle that has intensified since the aug 20 ceasefire 
in the war with iraq 
speculation rose that he sought to establish himself as his 
fathers political heir by engineering the march 28 dismissal of his 
fathers designated successor ayatollah husseinali montazeri 
ahmad was his fathers eyes and ears since their days in exile 
and through the islamic revolution that toppled the late shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi 
last month tehran newspapers published lengthy excerpts of a 
110page memorandum ahmad wrote to montazeri lashing him for 
seeking to undermine khomeinis regime and consorting with 
opposition groups 
the document appeared to be aimed at publicly projecting ahmad 
khomeini as a candidate to inherit his fathers mantle 
masoud rajavi leader of the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy 
warriors the main iranian opposition movement says khomeini was 
grooming ahmad as his successor 
rajavi said in a statement that khomeinis dismissal of montazeri 
for criticizing the regime prepared the ground for this 
appointment 
he argued that khomeinis appointment of a special committee to 
amend the constitution including downgrading the religious 
qualifications of his successor from divinely inspired authority 
was aimed at making room for ahmad 
but analysts believe the blackbearded ahmad could eventually 
become a political casualty now that his father is dead 
they believe that bereft of the ayatollahs authority and with 
no secure power base of his own ahmads influence could evaporate 
as khomeinis health deteriorated he was able to control his 
fathers statements and this gave him some authority chubin said 
but it would be rather difficult for him to be the keeper of 
the flame now that khomeini has gone ahmad has neither the 
religious credentials nor the administrative experience to rule and 
its not clear whether claiming dynastic credentials will be enough 
he could become a pawn in the power struggle a front man for 
more powerful people following his fathers death 
iran specialist shireen hunter of washingtons center for 
strategic and international studies said in a telephone interview 
i dont think hell emerge as irans strongman 
his power is really quite vicarious stemming primarily from 
his position as his fathers gatekeeper i dont believe he can fill 
his fathers shoes with 40 days of mourning declared for 
ayatollah khomeini iran has been engulfed by a wave of emotion for 
its dead leader a development ahmad could exploit to advance his 
political ambitions 
but ms hunter cautioned using khomeinis name could be a 
doubleedged sword there was already a backlash against khomeini 
and that in the end could work against ahmad the revolution is 
against dynasties 
he could well become a major player but hes not a person 
of great convictions and hell have to associate himself with one 
group or another to stay in play 
from the outside the political maneuverings in tehran are often 
opaque but last august ahmad was seen as a member of an unofficial 
troika with parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and khamenei both 
socalled pragmatists who had effectively taken over daytoday 
control as khomeinis health failed 
now hes aligned with the radicals led by interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi prosecutorgeneral musavi khoeiniha intelligence 
minister mohammad reyshahri and mohammad tavasoli a powerful 
behindthescenes figure in tehran 
some analysts believe ahmad could swing back to rafsanjani again 
if he sees him gaining ground 
but for now hes lined up against rafsanjani who was earlier 
outflanked by the radicals in the fundamentalist resurgence decreed 
by his father in february 
rafsanjani one of irans shrewdest politicians appears to be 
maneuvering his way back and could well come out on top again as he 
has done many times before 
there is speculation ahmad will run in presidential elections 
scheduled for aug 18 
so far the only announced candidate is the formidable rafsanjani 
who won the highest ballot in last years parliamentary elections 
with more than 13 million votes

a top us health official says the time is 
coming when doctors will report the names of people testing positive 
for the aids virus and try to trace victims sexual contacts but 
activists criticized the proposal 
dr james mason us assistant secretary for health said he 
didnt know when such a system would be in place but when it 
happens we will have normalized hiv and will handle it like 
syphilis 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus causes aids 
masons remarks tuesday at the fifth international conference on 
aids drew immediate criticism 
richard dunne executive director of the gay mens health crisis 
in new york opposed the proposal because he feared names would not 
be kept confidential and that people known to be infected would 
suffer from the stigma associated with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
people lose their jobs their housing and their schooling 
opportunities he said thats not like other diseases 
furthermore he said tracing patients sexual contacts will not 
work for aids as it does with syphilis because hiv patients may have 
been infected for years when they are diagnosed tracing partners so 
far back is unlikely he said 
the consequences of reporting would discourage many people from 
submitting to testing dunne said the only way people are going 
to come forward is if theres something effective to help them he 
said 
the gay mens health crisis received numerous calls tuesday from 
people who were already concerned that their names might be recorded 
if they seek testing dr stephen joseph the new york city health 
commissioner floated a similar proposal at the aids meeting monday 
congress has directed the us public health service to prepare a 
report on discrimination against people with aids and hiv infection 
mason said in anticipation of moves toward reporting the names of 
those tested 
he said early identification of infected people through contact 
tracing could allow them to be treated promptly with new drugs now 
being tested the cost of such treatment would run into the billions 
of dollars mason said he did not know where that money might come 
from 
in other conference reports 
researchers said initial studies on a new aids drug called cd4 
showed that the medicine is safe and may reduce levels of hiv in the 
body 
the drug is a decoy intended to confuse the virus and draw it 
away from the blood cells it ordinarily infects 
in expeimental use on 18 people dr robert yarchoan of the 
national cancer institute found that the drug appeared to lower 
virus levels in the body by about 50 percent however he cautioned 
that this could have been a natural fluctuation instead of a result 
of the drug 
another team found no clear evidence of virus reduction but 
researchers said they were still encouraged by the drugs potential 
and said higher doses could have a greater effect 
in a report scheduled for presentation today national cancer 
institute reserachers said a recently discovered herpes virus may 
accelerate the development of aids in people infected with hiv 
dr paulo lusso said the virus called hhv6 enhanced the growth 
of hiv in test tube causing more cells to die more quickly 
more than half of americans canadians and europeans have been 
exposed to hhv6 without any ill effects and may be capable of 
passing it on studies have shown 
researchers at johns hopkins university in baltimore said it was 
now possible to predict two years in advance which patients infected 
with hiv will develop aids studies suggest that a majority of 
people infected with the virus get aids or related illnesses 
a similar study by researchers at the university of california 
san francisco found that a combination of five laboratory tests can 
predict which patients will develop aids during a fouryear period

thousands of the troops responsible for the bloody 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement fanned out from the city 
center wednesday spraying gunfire as they passed chinese and 
diplomatic residential areas 
they appeared to be taking up positions for an attack possibly 
from rival military factions which had moved into the citys 
outskirts 
most of the troops from the 27th army in a convoy of hundreds of 
trucks and support vehicles appeared to be shooting into the air 
although some aimed at an apartment complex where hundreds of 
diplomats and other foreigners live 
several dozen bullets hit the windows of apartments facing the 
main street there were no reports of injuries 
at a nearby intersection troops took up defensive positions 
behind barricades and trees as if expecting an attack 
troops were also seen reinforcing positions at the beijing 
railway station to the east of tiananmen square and at the beijing 
union medical college hospital northeast of the square 
the 27th drove unarmed prodemocracy demonstrators from the 
center of beijing on early sunday killing hundreds in the most 
violent suppression of a popular movement in communist chinas 
40year history 
troops from the 28th and 38th armies and soldiers from 
northeastern china have moved into the city raising fears of a 
battle 
the 27th army is closely linked to president yang shangkun and 
other communist party hardliners 
the 28th army is believed to back zhao ziyang a moderate who 
challenged the conservatives and was stripped of his post as 
communist party leader the 38th army which is based around 
beijing reportedly refused orders to open fire on civilians and 
opposed the martial law crackdown 
there have been several skirmishes between rival military groups 
but no major clashes an unidentified general appeared on national 
television tuesday night and denied factional divisions in the 
peoples liberation army 
chinas foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the united 
states for what it called its shortsighted policies toward 
china 
the united states joining other western countries imposing 
sanctions on china has suspended arms sales and other military 
contacts to protest the violent suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement 
the ministry in a statement read on television insisted the 
situation in china is stable and there has been no change in the 
nations foreign policy 
about 3000 foot soldiers carrying rifles left tiananmen square 
in two waves wednesday the first group of about 1000 had packs on 
their backs and marched 20 abreast they were accompanied by a tank 
and two armored personnel carriers 
some 400 split soon from the main group and turned toward the 
south 
some in the second group were in plain clothes 
the troops chanted down with corruption we love the people 
we love the capital we love youth long live the communist party 
as they left their positions in tiananmen square 
people along the sidewalks initially cheered when they heard the 
chanting but one office worker said they can sing any slogan 
they want but then they start shooting 
an undetermined number of troops and tanks remained in the square 
another group of 600 foot soldiers wearing red armbands was seen 
advancing toward the square from the west they appeared to be 
preparing to take over traffic control 
thousands of foreigners are trying frantically to leave beijing 
the us embassy has told all americans to leave as soon as possible 
and the japanese embassy has told the 3000 japanese in the city to 
prepare for immediate evacuation 
many nations were arranging for special planes to transport their 
nationals out of the country 
the staterun xinhua news agency said qiao shi one of five 
members of the partys policymaking politburo standing committee 
received a telegram from the supreme peoples court supporting the 
crackdown 
the report read on beijing radio was significant because the 
telegram was sent to qiao and not zhao although zhao has not been 
seen publicly since may 19 officials have not confirmed he has lost 
his post 
diplomats have often considered qiao 64 a top candidate to 
replace zhao but a chinese source said wednesday that a family 
member said qiao had not been appointed party chief 
qiao generally is viewed as the partys lawandorder chief 
beijing radio also reported that conservative premier li peng 
attended a meeting tuesday to hear reports on industrial production 
a hong kong newspaper reported that li was shot in the thigh by a 
young guard officer but his wounds were not serious 
the reports were the first official indications of leadership 
positions since saturdays assault the leadership including senior 
leader deng xiaoping has not made any public appearances since the 
crackdown 
a report that deng had died added to the chaos the report from 
taiwan was denied by the government 
the us administration said it appeared likely that chinas 
senior leaders had left beijing 
soldiers continued firing into crowds around beijing on tuesday 
and early wednesday witnesses said a small boy was killed and a 
girl wounded in the head tuesday 
antigovernment demonstrations spread to shanghai nanjing 
chengdu shenyang and other cities 
chinas most famous dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi took 
refuge in the us embassy he had told the associated press last 
week he was concerned conservatives might arrest him 
government spokesman yuan mu said on television 300 people were 
killed in saturdays crackdown including 23 students and 7000 
were injured and 400 soldiers were missing the evening tv news said 
32 people were arrested most of them for trying to set fire to 
public buses 
us intelligence reports reaching washington indicate 3000 
people probably were killed a us official said tuesday 
on tuesday afternoon witnesses said the 27th army fought with 
soldiers from shanxi provinces 28th army believed loyal to zhao 
there were no reports of casualties 
the brief exchange including several rounds from a tank cannon 
occurred just south of the military museum in western beijing it 
followed unconfirmed reports of soldiers fighting soldiers in the 
western and southeastern parts of the city 
the peoples liberation army is organized into about 22 group 
armies each has about three divisions and totals about 40000 
soldiers 
hundreds of citizens flocked to the bridge at muxudi also in the 
west to welcome soldiers tuesday evening who said they were from 
the 38th army 
exterminate the 27th army avenge blood with blood people in 
the crowd chanted as they handed buns eggs and cigarettes to the 
troopers 
people do not be afraid said a voice from a loudspeaker 
carried by the soldiers the 38th army will not kill the people

thirdplace cbstv plans to become the network 
of the 1990s with more sports coverage and innovative programming 
the president of the cbs broadcast group told affiliates 
howard stringers comments tuesday were enthusiastically received 
by broadcasters attending the networks annual affiliates meeting 
the mood was in contrast to the skepticism at last years 
meeting which followed the networks firstever thirdplace finish 
in the ac nielsen co primetime ratings behind nbc and abc 
referring to praise for cbss news coverage of the weekend 
massacre in beijing stringer said it gives me great pleasure to 
see my old friend dan rather become the talk of the town again when 
people ask what larry tisch is going to get for 3 billion this is 
an example tisch is president of cbs 
the broadcasters also heard from rather and connie chung who 
talked by audio hookup to cbs correspondent richard roth in beijing 
and by television satellite to white house chief of staff john 
sununu in washington 
sununu defended president bushs cautious reaction to events in 
china were pushing as hard as we can but we cant push beyond 
the point of constructive interaction he said we do not want 
to give anyone cause to feel we are intervening or instigating 
bloodshed 
former first lady nancy reagan talked briefly following a 
discussion on drugs by rather chung and robert stutman head of the 
drug enforcement administration in new york stutman said the only 
effective way to fight drugs was a threepronged assault of law 
enforcement treatment and education 
i hear people blame other countries for our drug problem 
mrs reagan said but the united states alone is responsible for 
its drug problem its an illusion to think we can stop drugs by 
sending troops to foreign countries when we cant even stop drug 
sales in our own neighborhoods 
stringer compared the battles between the three commercial 
networks and cable television as gulliver being chained down by the 
tiny lilliputians in jonathan swifts satire gullivers travels 
i look on cable as the medias onearmed bandit viewers only 
win when it comes up three bars cbs abc and nbc we spent 4 
billion in hollywood and they take our programs and charge people 
money to watch 
the networks have long fought the cable industrys ability to use 
network programming without paying a fee stringer also referred to 
network efforts to overturn regulations by the federal 
communications commission prohibiting networks from participating in 
the syndication market

when the house republican leader warned his gop 
colleagues against a french revolution mentality in which evil 
democrats are hauled to the guillotine some began humming the 
french national anthem 
the incident at a party meeting tuesday illustrates the political 
blood lust that persists in a chamber fractured by months of ethics 
charges and countercharges and the uphill fight new house speaker 
thomas foley will have in trying to restore order 
the task i see for myself is to create the environment where 
debate can take place without recriminations without the kind 
of angry hostile feelings between members that have dominated the 
house of late foley told reporters 
this tension which has built up over a period of many months is 
going to require a little time to turn around he said its not 
going to be done in a day but i believe it will happen 
some democrats stung by the sacrifice of former speaker jim 
wright in the ethics storm have turned their sights on rep newt 
gingrich rga who filed the original ethics charges against 
wright an ethics investigation of gingrichs bookpromotion deal 
could begin as early as thursday 
of the ethics committee and gingrich rep louise slaughter 
dny said i want them to treat him fairly but i certainly 
want them to treat him 
the political knives remained out in the republican camp as 
well gop political operatives were searching financial disclosure 
reports for possible ethical shortcomings of democrats and gingrich 
spoke of new ethics cases yet to be filed against members of the 
majority party 
minority leader robert michel of illinois who warned his 
colleagues against a frenzy of political executions blamed the 
atmosphere on 35 years of uninterrupted power for democrats and 
said ethics abuses wont be forgotten 
i am all for putting an end to bitterness michel said i 
am all in favor of putting our house in order but we wont do so by 
sweeping things under the rug 
in an acceptance speech to the house foley directed many of his 
comments at the republican side promising increased consultation 
and appealing to shared values of trust and public service 
the calming style was in sharp contrast to that of wright where 
wright confronted foley counsels where wright followed his own 
compass foley seeks advice 
republicans will now be looking for that style to be translated 
into changes that will benefit them foley may be able to buy some 
peace by permitting more republican amendments to be offered to 
bills on the house floor or by bringing legislation before the 
house under less restrictive rules 
if he does ill be totally and cheerfully bipartisan said 
gingrich the gops chief gadfly 
but he doubted that foley would be able to give the republicans 
much latitude on issues they want most such as a balanced budget 
amendment to the constitution and the death penalty for drug and 
other offenses those are anathema to the left wing of the 
democratic party he said 
while he appealed for cooperation foley did not seek to hide his 
own ideology he openly acknowledged at a news conference that he is 
a liberal the label that democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis sought vainly to avoid last year 
and he clearly reserved the sole right to set the houses agenda 
the prerogative of the majority 
procedurally tom will try to work with the republicans to be 
fair said budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif i 
think the difference will be he will be a fighter on issues the 
democrats stand for

with president bush vowing that the scourge 
of drugs will stop and drug czar william j bennett organizing the 
troops for a fullscale war calls for decriminalization of drug use 
are like cries in the dark 
but the cries are getting louder and have drawn together people 
from disparate sides of the political spectrum from conservative 
william f buckley to baltimore mayor kurt schmoke a former 
prosecutor 
advocates of such a stance point to a drop in crime rates 
following the 1933 end of prohibition that had outlawed liquor sales 
since 1920 today huge drug profits and artificially high drug 
prices are fueling the violent crime plaguing cities throughout the 
country they say 
removing the profits would remove the criminals the argument 
goes and the billions of dollars now spent on unsuccessful 
enforcement efforts could be funneled into treatment and education 
programs 
but the bush administration maintains the need for zero 
tolerance of illicit drug use and fighting the war on drugs 
even if it requires scarce federal financial resources is a 
priority on capitol hill in march bush told one group of high 
school students that legalizing drugs would be 180 degrees wrong 
a recent forum featuring advocates of decriminalization 
organized by the libertarianleaning cato institute and featuring 
presentations by schmoke princeton university professor ethan 
nadelmann and attorney james ostrowksi drew attendees from 
bennetts office of national drug control policy the justice 
department and the health and human services department 
the three who spoke to the forum emphasized that they werent 
advocating use of nowillicit drugs 
the available evidence indicates that legalization would not 
lead to an explosion in drug use the repeal of alcohol prohibition 
did not said ostrowski the decriminalization of marijuana in 
alaska and the netherlands did not the cheap and ready access to 
cocaine and narcotics in the 19th century did not 
the fact is most people in our society are capable of acting 
responsibly when it comes to drugs he said users of nicotine 
are declining alcohol abusers are only a small percentage of the 
population 
the panel members differed however on how much 
decriminalization they want 
schmoke stressed that although he believes marijuana use and 
sales should not have criminal penalties he was not advocating that 
sales of cocaine heroin and other dangerous drugs be allowed in the 
same manner that alcoholic beverages are now sold 
the model that i think makes the most sense is the model in 
holland in which the government treats addicts as patients and says 
that you can obtain these substances from certified health 
professionals schmoke said but if you obtain these substances 
outside the public health system youre subject to criminal 
sanctions 
such a plan lowers the crime rate because you dont have to 
rob and steal and break into peoples houses to obtain enough goods 
to buy drugs and it restricts the spread of aids that otherwise 
would be transmitted through the sharing of needles he said 
nadelmann said that from a strict costbenefit analysis 
including money spent for enforcement of drug laws as well as the 
cost of violence corruption and the need for everexpanding prisons 
the prohibition on drugs makes no sense 
he acknowledged that while the illegality of some drugs may make 
some people particularly those in higher socioeconomic groups stay 
away from the substances the nation cant ignore the violence 
plaguing inner cities much of it caused by the illegality of the 
drugdealers trade 
everincreasing spending on unsuccessful enforcement makes no 
sense nadelmann argued 
everything weve been doing in the past or that were talking 
about doing now and that people are talking about doing in the 
future in terms of criminal justice approaches is doomed to 
failure he said twenty years of experience has shown that 
and it has nothing to do with corruption in latin america or 
turf squabbles between law enforcement agencies or with whether or 
not we have a drug czar or whether or not his name is william 
bennett nadelmann said what it has to do with is the nature of 
the market the nature of the commodity and how lucrative the whole 
thing is 
its impossible to wipe out all the opium fields in the world he 
said and its impossible to intercept all the cocaine imported to 
the united states without virtually closing down foreign trade and 
sealing the borders 
former sen george mcgovern of south dakota said after the forum 
that he remained undecided on the issue 
i think the strongest argument is getting the criminal element 
out of the drug business said mcgovern who ran unsuccessfully 
for president in 1972 and is now on the lecture circuit 
but mcgovern said he doubted congress is ready to hear the 
decriminalization arguments 
maybe five to 10 years down the road youll be getting more 
serious evaluation of this side of the argument he said

the agriculture department is reviewing a grain 
companys possible links to a fugitive commodities trader in 
switzerland and its receipt of at least 65 million in government 
export subsidies 
at issue are the companys ties to marc rich who fled to 
switzerland in 1983 before his indictment for criminal tax evasion 
racketeering mail and wire fraud 
a department official confirmed tuesday that usda was examining 
richco grain ltd a swissbased company with an office in stamford 
conn and payments it received through the export enhancement 
program known as eep 
the review was started at the request of the chairman of a house 
agriculture subcommittee rep dan glickman dkan who raised 
questions about the company at a hearing earlier this year and on 
tuesday asked the agency for a full investigation 
glickman in a letter to the agency said an unmistakable line 
of ownership control and profit runs from richco grain to rich 
through a series of subsidiary arrangements 
while i am disturbed that a company whose main operations lie 
outside of the united states can establish but a nominal onshore 
presence and qualify to receive eep bonuses as appears to be the 
case with richco grain i am truly shocked that a fugitive from us 
justice can benefit from a program funded by taxpayer dollars 
glickman said in his letter to agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
under the export enhancement program private exporters can sell 
us commodities at lower prices to meet foreign competition and 
then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities 
as bonuses or subsidies 
richard crowder under secretary for international affairs and 
commodity programs said usda had started checking through what 
the connections are between richco and rich he declined to 
provide any details on the findings so far 
an official of richco al church declined to comment about the 
usda review and would not provide any information about the company 
glickman asked that usdas office of inspector general determine 
whether richco qualified for the export subsidy program and whether 
department eligibility guidelines need to be changed to close any 
possible loopholes used by richco 
richco has the same telephone number as clarendon ag a us 
subsidiary of marc rich amp co ag of switzerland clarendon and the 
marc rich company settled a federal tax evasion case in 1984 by 
pleading guilty and agreeing to pay more than 200 million in back 
taxes fines and other penalties 
criminal charges against rich were unaffected by the settlement 
the government alleged that rich and his commoditytrading empire 
cheated the government out of millions of dollars in taxes through a 
series of illegal oil transactions among richcontrolled companies 
richco has received at least 65 million worth of subsidies 
through eep ranking it ninth among grain exporters in the program 
according to information supplied to a house committee by usda most 
recently richco picked up estimated subsidies of 250000 for a 
wheat sale to the soviet union 
last month president bush approved use of the subsidy program 
for the sale of 15 million tons of wheat to the soviets richco 
handled at least 30000 tons of the initial part of the wheat deal 
subsidies averaged 846 per ton for richco and four other 
companies according to usda 
glickman who met tuesday with yeutter and crowder said congress 
might need to pass legislation disqualifying richco from the export 
program unless usda administratively barred it from receiving more 
subsidies 
the export enhancement program has undergone some criticism 
anyway it would be a shame to jeopardize its future because were 
providing bonus commodities to a tax fugitive said glickman 
this is a guy of renowned international bad dealings

while several police organizations are urging 
congress to approve strict controls on semiautomatic assaultstyle 
weapons some 225 officers gathered on capitol hill to say those 
groups dont speak for them 
the average policeman in america right now is extremely upset 
with the misrepresentations said patrolman thomas j aveni jr 
who asked that his department be identified only as being in camden 
county nj 
the notion that policemen favor gun bans as a solution to 
violent crime is wrong said aveni who recently organized a group 
called law enforcement for the preservation of the second amendment 
which guarantees the right to keep and bear arms 
the majority of us have taken an oath to uphold the 
constitution he said in an interview the second amendments 
the cornerstone of the constitution if the second amendment goes 
theres no guarantee that the rest of the constitution will remain 
intact without arms people are powerless to dissent against 
any kind of tyranny or repression of government 
aveni was one of the 225 officers flown to washington by the 
national rifle association to participate in a news conference 
tuesday and lobby their respective congressmen and senators the 
only state not represented by an officer was hawaii 
they were here to combat the impact of guncontrol endorsements 
by law enforcement officials such as los angeles police chief daryl 
gates and baltimore county police chief neil behan who are pushing 
for controls on assaultstyle weapons including semiautomatic 
versions of the ak47 and uzi 
law enforcement groups that have taken similar stands include the 
national fraternal order of police the international association of 
chiefs of police the national sheriffs association the national 
association of police organizations and the police executive 
research forum 
for thousands of us out there that the chiefs the appointed 
officials do not speak for the law enforcement officers that are in 
the field in the trenches doing the job said patrolman ray 
maples president of the memphis police association 
but stephen brown counsel to the national fraternal order of 
police countered that his organization speaks for 200000 of those 
officers not for their bosses 
the fraternal order of police does speak for the cop on the 
street brown said there are no chiefs there are no sheriffs 
they dont speak for anyone except for the cops on the beat 
the contention by some law enforcement leaders that their 
officers are being outgunned by criminals wielding assaultstyle 
weapons offends me officer leroy pyle of the san jose calif 
police department said at the news conference 
santa monica calif officer gary steiner said criminals have 
better firearms because theyre making more money these days 
unfortunately police departments have for many years been 
forced to look at the bottom line in terms of low bid and that 
applies to our safety equipment in particular steiner said 
cincinnati police lt harry thomas said many of the officers 
attending were under direct orders from their police chiefs to 
disassociate themselves from their respective police departments 
in their comments 
the remarks that are made here should not be construed as the 
official policy of our respective police departments he said

the domination of an airport by a single 
airline is either a blow or a boon to competition and low fares 
depending on whose report you believe 
the general accounting office in a study released today says 
air fares average 27 percent more per passenger mile at 15 major hub 
airports than fares at nonhubs it said competition has decreased 
on many routes 
the airline industrys air transport association in a 60airport 
study made public tuesday said competition is up and average fares 
at twothirds of the nations hub airports have decreased in the 
last four years it says average fares at 30 hub airports are only 
15 percent higher than at nonhubs 
direct comparisons between the two studies are not possible 
because they deal with different statistics each putting its own 
slant on the controversy over the practice of major airlines of 
routing a large share of their flights through a single airport 
both studies agree however that fares generally have decreased 
since deregulation a decade ago and that the establishment of hub 
airports has brought greater efficiency to commercial aviation hubs 
enable airlines to consolidate maintenance and other operations at 
one or two airports 
the senate commerce science and transportation subcommittee on 
aviation today was looking into the effects of the hub system on 
passenger fares and competitition among the airlines both studies 
have been submitted to the subcommittee 
the study by the gao which is the investigative arm of congress 
says fares for dominant airlines at 13 of the 15 hubs studied were 
higher than fares for other airlines serving the same airports 
it also says fares for the airlines rose after they established 
the dominant position at the hub airports comparisons were made 
with 38 nonhub airports 
in showing decreased competition the gao report says that after 
a single airline gained dominance at an airport the number of 
destinations served by four or more airlines fell 52 percent while 
the number served by only one carrier increased 25 percent 
hubbing generates important operating efficiencies but it can 
also lead to substantial market power for the airlines which could 
lead to higher fares and reduced levels of service said gao 
official kenneth m mead in testimony prepared for the subcommittee 
hearing 
the industry study conducted by the aviation consulting firm of 
simat helliesen amp eichner for the ata concludes that despite 
increased concentration within the industry and at some airports 
competition in individual markets has increased 
there is very little if any significant relationship between 
average fares and airline concentration at either hub or nonhub 
airports the study says 
the hub and spoke system has evolved into a highly competitive 
national transportation system which provides enormous benefits to 
the american public said robert aaronson ata president 
the industry study says that higher levels of service such as 
more nonstop flights account for higher average fare levels at 
some hubs 
but the association said passengers have the option of flying 
multistop flights or connecting flights at lower fares 
the ata said its study looked at airline schedules at 25 airports 
fed by hubs and found that they are now servied by an average of 
nearly twice as many airlines as in 1978 prior to deregulation of 
the industry

the house loves to call itself the peoples 
house and its members like to act like folks 
on high state occasions like tuesdays when the house installed 
a new speaker it has to go ceremonial but it couldnt quite shed 
its oldshoe habits 
when thomas s foley had been duly elected the doorkeeper 
bellowed out just as he does on state of the union night mister 
speaker introducing new speaker thomas s foley to departing 
speaker jim wright 
and foley marched the route of presidents down the central 
aisle accompanied by an escorting committee shaking hands all 
round 
but still the house is the house so some members brought their 
children to work to be there for the history of it all and plunked 
them on the plush brown leather seats six of the kids sat in one 
row 
one tried to figure out how his white sailor hat could be made to 
fit his knee another tried out his sunglasses against the bright 
lights when the adults stood and applauded so did the kids 
to old timers in the galleries the moment brought to mind 
another occasion when a popular product of the house stood before 
the chamber at the climax of a tense national drama 
that was 1974 when gerald r ford the former house republican 
leader arrived as president having succeeded richard nixon a 
chief executive who resigned in disgrace largely due to the houses 
own impeachment process 
mister speaker the doorkeeper bellowed then too but ford 
showed the members that he was still a man of the house with a corny 
line he was he said the same old guy i am a ford not a 
lincoln 
the ethical troubles which compelled jim wright to resign as 
speaker were no watergate but within the house an insular body 
the trauma was almost comparable 
foley had no catchy line like fords but he called up some 
numbers to deal with something ronald reagan and others had been 
saying about the house that it has become a selfperpetuating body 
reagan just before leaving office noted that 98 percent of 
house members who ran for reelection won and concluded it was 
easier to be reelected to the house than to the supreme soviet 
foleys answer only 7 percent of the houses current members 
were in the house when i was first elected in 1964 eightone 
percent of the current members have been elected since 1974 more 
than half of the current members 55 percent have been elected 
since 1980 the constant change in membership is a source of great 
strength for the house but fundamentally and more importantly the 
house reflects the will of the electorate 
foley had another comparison he contrasted the transfer of power 
here with the awkward reaching toward democratic formulas in moscow 
and warsaw and the bloody events in beijing he said congressmen can 
be proud that the values which have sustained the house now sweep 
around the world 
we are he said using that phrase again proud to call 
this the peoples house the fundamental institution of american 
democracy

the government is not doing enough to keep the 
elderly from being ripped off by people appointed to handle their 
social security checks senators said after being told of abuses 
an arkansas woman and a california woman misused social security 
payments that they had been entrusted to manage on behalf of elderly 
beneficiaries the senate special committee on aging was told 
tuesday at a hearing 
elizabeth freeland of sacramento calif testified that she was 
told by the government that she needed a representative to handle 
her disability benefits because she was incapable of managing the 
money herself 
but she said the woman who was appointed kept some of the 
benefits for herself and had a history of writing bad checks she 
did not identify the appointee 
mary miller of marvell ark told the panel that her 
representative collected her disability benefits but then refused 
to use the money to buy a telephone clothes or other necessities 
that miller requested 
she often would not tell me how much money she would have of 
mine or what was going on she said 
the system is so ripe for abuse that in some communities in our 
nation private profiteers are virtually lining up at social 
security offices in the hope they can get their hands on a 
beneficiarys money by being appointed a payee said curtis child 
attorney for a legal services firm in sacramento 
he called the governments oversight of the payee program lax 
about 46 million social security beneficiaries have mental or 
physical impairments deemed serious enough that they need someone to 
manage their benefits 
the social security administration accepts applications from 
anyone who wants to be a payee but gives preference to relatives or 
to public or private groups with good records in handling elderly 
affairs 
but sens david pryor dark and john heinz rpa said the 
government has not been vigilant enough in overseeing the program 
there is some evidence that ssa has not been keeping a close 
watch on those who apply to be representative payees heinz said 
presently the ssa does not do background checks nor does the ssa 
monitor the program to ensure that the beneficiaries actually 
receive their money 
louis enoff an ssa deputy commissioner said the administration 
recognized there was a problem and was evaluating steps to remedy 
it he said the victims represent a small percentage of the 
beneficiarfies and are often poor or handicapped people without 
relatives to care for them 
enoff said ssa verifies the identities of payee applicants and 
asks them whether they have felony convictions 
he said he was concerned about a bill introduced by pryor and 
heinz on tuesday that would require ssa to conduct criminal 
background checks on applicants while barring most creditors from 
becoming payees 
a ban on creditors would be too stringent and would keep for 
example helpful landlords from becoming payees enoff said

un officials in charge of sudans famine 
relief operation say an agreement between rebels and the government 
to allow safe transit of emergency supplies could help save up to 
100000 sudanese lives 
the delivery of food and other supplies before the rainy season 
cuts off access by dirt roads and airstrips is behind schedule but 
recent accords between guerrillas and the government improve the 
survival prospects for thousands james p grant head of operation 
lifeline sudan said tuesday 
its going to be a very difficult summer and fall but i think 
at this stage barring a collapse of the present sort of pattern of 
cooperation i think we can say that the great majority of those 
100000 deaths that looked so likely in february and early march can 
be averted the un official said 
more than 60000 tons of food has already been delivered and the 
relief operation is attempting to deliver another 20000 to 40000 
tons before the heaviest rains hit in july and august grant said 
for the first time in history there is in the middle of a 
civil war a plan of action agreed to by both parties with 
corridors of tranquility for the passage of supplies said 
grant who returned from observing the operation last week 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army spla is fighting for 
more autonomy in the southern provinces where the government 
generally controls only garrison towns 
a railway route from central to southern sudan is now open said 
grant one rail trip was completed in late may another is set to 
begin saturday and two more runs are planned later this month 
the first train with over 100 cars moved south through rebel 
and governmentheld areas reaching warweary aweil on may 28 
at one government garrison where the train stopped overnight 
the train was so long that the spla was guarding the tail end of the 
train while the government was guarding the front of the train 
grant said 
the government and rebels have both agreed to respect the 
corridors of tranquility as long as necessary said grant 
in addition both parties have agreed to meet in addis ababa 
ethiopia on saturday to open talks aimed at reaching a 
comprehensive truce 
the spla has also announced it is extending its monthlong 
unilateral ceasefire for another two weeks said grant 
although the rainy season has already begun operation lifeline 
sudan has not yet lost the use of all dirt roads and airstrips he 
said 
bulldozers have been able to keep open dirt roads linking kenya 
with southern sudan so truck convoys can pass and the relief 
operation has been able to use lighter planes to land on rainsodden 
dirt airstrips 
however a barge convoy planned for the blue nile between kosti 
and malakal has not yet been able to start said grant negotiations 
with the government unions and barge crews are still under way 
despite that setback and other delays grant said he was more 
optimistic for the prospects for success than at any time in the 
past 
the united nations estimates 250000 sudanese died last year from 
starvation due to flood or drought or warinduced famine

the chef of an exclusive french restaurant says 
veal producers who confine calves in small stalls and feed them 
noiron formula to get pure white meat have a mistaken idea of what 
the best cooks want 
as a chef the quality of the veal used in my kitchen is very 
important and yet of equal concern to me is the quality of life of 
these calves said jeanlouis palladin of jeanlouis restaurant at 
the watergate hotel in support of legislation that would change the 
way veal is raised 
palladin was one of 34 witnesses tuesday at a house agriculture 
subcommittee hearing in a debate over whether calves destined to 
become cuts of milkfed veal ought to spend their short lives in a 
freer state consuming more than just liquid 
the legislation pits animal rights advocates against government 
agriculture officials and most of the relatively small us veal 
industry 
palladin and others supporting the bill sponsored by rep charles 
bennett dfla said the rationale behind current practice is that 
the public wants pure white meat 
for me the foremost concern is the taste not the color of the 
meat said palladin he said he thinks the confinement of calves 
in small crates can lead to weakness illness and use of antibiotics 
in milk formulas all of which affect the quality of the meat 
but wanda cooper who has been raising calves in michigan since 
1976 said disease problems were nothing short of horrifying 
when she and her husband tried letting the animals roam 
we had no control over the amount of milk calves could drink at 
will weak calves were pushed aside navel sucking ear sucking and 
urine drinking were common she said 
dr john mcglone associate professor of animal science at texas 
tech university said there is no scientific evidence that solid 
food is better for calves than a milk formula with nutrients 
in answer to concerns about the lack of iron in calves diets 
mcglone said borderline anemia of veal calves does not cause 
serious health problems 
he said many of those attacking the industry actually have a 
broader goal of ending all human consumption of meat 
the veal industry is a small segment of american agriculture 
mcglone said because of its small size it is a relatively easy 
target for advocate roups that seek to reduce or eliminate use of 
animals by humans 
the bennett bill would require that calves be given solid food 
and iron have physical contact with one another and be kept in 
larger enclosures 
the crate system most commonly used in the united states is so 
confining that the calves cannot turn around or lie down 
comfortably said michael fox of the humane society of the united 
states 
these normally playful animals are kept practically immobile 
are prone to be unhealthy and lead a miserable existence said fox 
dr franklin loew dean of tufts university school veterinary 
medicine said veal stalls commonly are 22 to 24 inches wide and 60 
inches long he said calves average 239 pounds when they are 
slaughtered 
dr r d plowman administrator of the agriculture departments 
agricultural research service said about 1 million of the nearly 40 
million cattle slaughtered each year are specialfed calves at the 
center of this controversy 
there is a general perception that calves are purposely made 
iron deficient or anemic to produce the desired coloration of the 
meat said plowman this is not true 
he said research shows that raising calves in elevated 
individual stalls reduces disease and increases survival rates when 
calves nuzzle each other they pass along infections he said

even as jim wright nominated thomas s foley as 
speaker of the house in a somber speech on the floor workers were 
trundling his possessions out of the speakers ceremonial office on 
canvascovered carts 
wright spent his final moments as speaker tuesday holding his 
regular presession news conference but revealed little about his 
plans or his state of mind 
he declared simply i feel fine 
last week wright announced he was giving up the speakership and 
his house seat after charges of ethics rules violations that 
virtually paralyzed the house 
by next week wright said he would be enjoying life i hope 
and trust rejoicing in the good portion that has followed me and 
the opportunities that have been given me in life 
colleagues said they expected the texas democrat to keep a hand 
in political affairs 
he is healthy and well and feeling good and hes going to be 
able to contribute to political debate and thought for many years 
said rep jim chapman dtexas 
wright has said he will resign his seat later this month 
as giant orange trash cans waited to be filled with cardboard 
boxes stuffed full of folders frames and plaques in his staffs 
adjacent office wright was asked if he had any parting words 
i might express my appreciation to all of you for keeping a 
robust discussion going he told a room full of reporters i 
might want to write a column or two someone suggested i should 
become a columnist it might be a good thing in fact i might 
discover who these unnamed sources are 
just 45 minutes before he was to nominate foley before house 
democrats wright closeted himself in his office with notes written 
the night before and wrote his last speech as speaker 
a floor below outside the dining room where texas democrats have 
met for lunch on wednesdays with wright as their leader rep bill 
richardson dnm said he sensed an aura of hopefulness mixed 
with sadness prevading the capitol 
for the first time in three months i feel upbeat because the 
ascension of foley promises a great deal in the area of rebuilding 
the institution of the house which is at its lowest level 
richardson said 
at the same time he said he felt sadness for wright who had 
campaigned for him and looked after new mexicos interests in 
congress 
but ive talked to the speaker and hes at peace with himself 
and that made me feel better richardson said he looks serene 
he looks comfortable in the last month he had looked 
crestfallen 
wright resigned after a yearlong investigation by the house 
ethics committee that produced allegations that he had violated 
house ethics rules 69 times 
the allegations surrounded sales of wrights book reflections 
of a public man his wifes employment by a family friend fort 
worth developer george mallick and his relationship with mallick 
asked if he would write a book wright told reporters im not 
sure i tried that once

a federal auditing agency says third world 
countries are falling behind on 70 billion in debt repayments to 
us banks and that american regulators should make banks put up 
more reserves to protect depositors against loan losses 
the report by the general accounting office the auditing arm of 
congress did not name the debtor countries 
argentina the third largest debtor behind brazil and mexico has 
paid no interest on its foreign debt for more than one year and owes 
us banks more than 85 billion 
the gao said regulators should demand that banks put up about 12 
times more reserves against loan losses than is currently required 
because banks generally respond to reserve requirements by 
writing down assets by the required amounts a decline in the book 
value of their assets results the gao said in a note on figures 
it sent to rep john j lafalce dny a member of the house 
banking committee 
though the auditors report did not say so writing down a banks 
assets reduces the amount of business it can do and makes the 
management look bad to depositors and stockholders 
a bank is now only required to put up reserves when the 
regulators declare foreign loans it has made to be either a total 
loss or valueimpaired that means the debtors have not paid 
interest for six months or have shown in other ways that they are in 
deep trouble bank regulators next week are expected to discuss 
behind closed doors whether to put loans to argentina in the 
valueimpaired pigeonhole 
the list already contains poland bolivia peru zaire sudan 
nicaragua and liberia but their total debt is small compared with 
the major debtors 
in a letter tuesday to alan greenspan chairman of the federal 
reserve board lafalce joined in urging that the banks put up more 
reserves the federal reserve takes the lead in the us regulation 
process 
us banks maintain lower reserve levels than almost all other 
industrialized countries lafalce wrote

rep thomas s foley was 30 minutes late for 
his first meeting as speaker with president bush but bush couldnt 
have minded since the democratic leader was running late from a 
speech that warmly praised the republican president 
a few days before senate democratic leader george mitchell stood 
outside bushs oceanside vacation home in maine and publicly hailed 
the presidents nato armscontrol initiatives and his response to 
the turmoil in china 
at the highest levels of the nations elective government 
sweetness and light is the prevailing theme 
and while this harmony may be threatened by rumblings below 
including new efforts by the republican national committee to 
discredit foley some political analysts are predicting a period of 
rare bipartisanship ahead 
there are some striking similarities among bush foley and 
mitchell both in matters of style and personality and in their 
appeals to bury partisan differences and work on forging consensus 
positions they often sound alike 
foleys acceptance speech on tuesday following his election as 
speaker echoed bushs own inaugural address invocation of the age 
of the offered hand to the democratic leadership 
after lavishly praising republican leader robert michel foley 
said republicans and dmocrats should come together put aside 
bitterness and hostility 
of bush foley declared we have one president at a time and 
he who does not wish president bush well is no friend of the 
republic 
foley then came to the white house late and the love fest 
continued with bush telling a bipartisan group of congressional 
leaders foleys election was a main happening 
outside foley told reporters the problem is to turn whatever 
rancorous atmosphere we have in the congress back to a spirit of 
conciliation and cooperation 
like bush who kept a low profile in eight years as vice 
president and in a string of top appointed jobs before then foley 
earned a reputation for working quietly behind the scenes 
he is far more subdued than his immediate predecessor the highly 
partisan jim wright under whom foley worked as majority leader as 
well as the colorful thomas p tip oneill who was speaker when 
foley was majority whip 
much of the same could be said of mitchell a former judge who 
was appointed to the senate in 1980 to fill the unexpired term of 
sen edmund muskie when muskie quit to become secretary of state 
even though he had no prior political experience mitchell went 
on to win in 1982 and 1988 and became widely respected for his hard 
work and evenhanded approach 
as chairman of the senate democratic senatorial committee he 
helped engineer the democrats recapture of the senate in 1986 
all three men bush mitchell and foley have been accused of 
having a somewhat wooden speaking style and a lowkey approach but 
all three have made large numbers of friends in both parties 
mitchell has even been known to hitch a ride to maine on air 
force two from time to time back when thenvice president bush 
headed to his home in kennebunkport on weekends in the days when he 
had more time on his hands 
these three men are in a single word professionals said 
william schneider an political analyst with the american enterprise 
institute 
bush values professionalism you can tell from the kind of 
appointments he made foley worked up through the ranks trusted and 
admired by his colleagues mitchell was a judge which might 
automatically suggest judiciousness these are people who know what 
theyre doing schneider continued 
stephen hess an analyst with brookings institution agrees says 
this is unique for a period in which you have divided government 
with one party controlling the white house and another the congress 
the sort of conciliation these individuals represent is perfect 
for this moment but not necessarily for all times hess 
continued its not necessarily the best way to create innovation 
or to take the political risks that are sometimes needed

adm william j crowe the senior us military 
officer plans to open an 11day visit to the soviet union by asking 
his soviet counterparts for details of their proposals to cut 
conventional forces in europe 
crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told reporters 
tuesday he also expected to sign an agreement in moscow on 
curtailing dangerous military incidents 
the focus of the trip is likely to be proposals by the east and 
west blocs to sharply reduce their troops tanks and warplanes in 
central europe the two sides have recently advanced similar 
proposals but details remain to be spelled out 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in his armscut proposals 
has talked about men and he has talked about weapons systems 
crowe said in remarks at the pentagon 
there are a lot of questions in our mind about exactly what 
that means and what dismantling means and what they will do with 
those systems and what systems they are talking about those 
questions have not all been answered said crowe who is scheduled 
to arrive in moscow next monday he will tour five of the 15 soviet 
republics 
crowe said he would ask the soviets why they recently increased 
tank production despite statements by gorbachev that defense 
spending would be cut by 14 percent and military production by 20 
percent over coming years 
the proposed agreement on the prevention of dangerous military 
activities which crowe said he expected to sign on the first day of 
his visit is designed to prevent such incidents as the shooting 
death of maj arthur nicholson at the hands of soviet soldiers in 
east germany on march 24 1985 
crowe said the proposed agreement also would address naval 
incidents inside territorial waters such as the bumping of two us 
navy vessels by soviet ships off the crimea in the black sea on feb 
12 1988 and the use of laser range finders that might blind 
soldiers or sailors on either side 
the visit by crowe who will be accompanied by the vice chiefs of 
the four us military services follows a tour of the united states 
last july by marshal sergei akhromeyev then the soviet chief of 
staff akhromeyev has since become an adviser to gorbachev and has 
been replaced as defense minister by col gen mikhail a moiseyev 
the americans according to an itinerary handed out at the 
briefing will visit an unidentified soviet missile facility in the 
ukraine see a ground exercise in byelorussia ride on a soviet 
missile cruiser and watch a naval maneuver off murmansk the 
northern soviet port on the barents sea 
crowe said he also asked to see a soviet submarine but had not 
received a response

a key contractor helping to design the navys 
seawolf nuclear attack submarine says development snags could delay 
completion of the first vessel 
the warning issued last december by the newport news va 
shipbuilding amp drydock co to the naval sea systems command 
complained of a lack of progress by the navy and another contractor 
general electric co in developing the combat system of sensors and 
computers needed to operate the new subs weaponry 
newport news shipbuilding said the delays could mean the navy may 
not get the first completed sub in may 1995 as planned 
continuing delays in completion of the combat system design 
or the emergence of significant changes in the design could 
seriously impact the lead ship design schedule the company said 
the seawolf or ssn21 is described by the navy as the key to 
rebuilding the us edge in underwater warfare an advantage that 
has eroded over the past decade because of espionage scandals and 
soviet efforts to build quieter submarines of their own 
the report from newport news shipbuilding was disclosed tuesday 
by rep john conyers jr dmich in a letter to defense secretary 
dick cheney voicing strong concern about a highrisk acquisition 
strategy being pursued by the navy in the procurement of the 50 
billionplus ssn21 seawolf submarine program 
newport news shipbuilding holds the contract for designing the 
seawolfs hull and interior layout the company concluded in its 
december report that it could not keep the project on schedule 
unless the combat system design development is brought in line 
with the ship design development 
in essence the ship design and the combat system design have 
become out of phase by over a year newport news said 
conyers asked cheney to review the program and give his view of 
whether all operational tests should be completed on the first sub 
before a fullscale production goahead is given 
each seawolf is now expected to cost more than 15 billion 
my concern about this matter has been reinforced by a copy of a 
letter which has recently come to my attention indicating strong 
concern about the design of the anbsy2 fire control system 
conyers wrote 
the congressman said would like the defense secretary to tell him 
when and how will you know whether the problems raised in the 
newport news naval shipyard letter will affect the planned delivery 
date of the first ssn21 
the navy on tuesday declined to discuss the substance of the 
newport news report saying it would not be appropriate to comment 
on what will become the substance of a reply to conyers 
the navy did say however it was confident the combat system 
would be delivered on time for the lead seawolf sub 
the ssn21 like the current 688 or los angelesclass attack 
sub will be designed primarily to hunt and kill soviet submarines 
it is supposed to feature greater speed better sensors and 
longerrange weapons than the 688 class 
the navy maintains the seawolf is going to represent a major 
advance in speed depth quieting weapons capability and 
supportability

the commandant of the marine corps has ordered 
every marine aviation unit around the world to shut down for two 
days of refresher safety training in hopes of reversing a 
devastating trend in aircraft accidents 
gen al gray the commandant wrote in a directive that 45 
marines had died this year in flying accidents and that crew 
error was to blame in each case 
it is time to pause catch our breath and come to grips with 
the devastating trend established this year gray wrote in his 
onepage directive which was distributed monday night and obtained 
tuesday by the associated press 
our machines are not letting us down we are letting ourselves 
down 
the fourstar general said he would leave it to the commanders of 
each unit to decide when to schedule the refresher training but 
that it must be within the next two weeks 
fortyfive marines have perished in seven aircraft mishaps thus 
far in 1989 may alone saw 22 marines and five aircraft lost when i 
examine the information available on the circumstances surrounding 
these tragedies aircrew error predominates and most likely will be 
a primary cause in all these mishaps 
lt col fred peck a spokesman at marine corps headquarters 
here said it was most unusual for a commandant to order a 
complete shutdown of the marine aviation community 
none of our people can ever recall this happening in the 
past said peck but you can see from the directive how 
seriously gen gray takes this 
the marine corps both active and reserve operates about 1200 
aircraft of various types spread among 87 different squadrons 
the order for refresher safety instruction comes less than six 
months after the marine corps completed its safest flying year in 
history indeed in less than six months the marines have exceeded 
the entire 1988 total for aviation fatalities by 73 percent 
during 1988 the corps suffered 11 socalled class a accidents 
involving 12 aircraft and lost 26 people fortyfive people already 
have died this year in marine aircraft accidents involving seven 
aircraft 
six of the seven aircraft destroyed so far this year have been 
helicopters several of which were carrying large numbers of marines 
on training maneuvers the most recent occurred may 30 when a ch46 
transport crashed into the pacific ocean after taking off from the 
uss denver off the coast of okinawa killing 14 
prior to that accident two ch46s collided in the air on may 27 
near reno nev killing two marines on may 3 five died when a 
uh1 huey crashed during an exercise in france and one marine died 
the same day when his av8b harrier jet crashed at parris island 
sc 
in march during the annual team spirit exercises in south korea 
four died on march 17 when a ch46 crashed and on march 20 19 died 
when a ch53d crashed 
the military services rarely discuss the probable cause of fatal 
accidents instead following procedures that call for completion of 
a final investigative report 
grays disclosure that all of this years accidents appear to 
have been caused by crew error is thus unusual it was described by 
one marine source as a disclosure that we believe is necessary 
under the circumstances 
gray in his directive said the real issue was the 
preservation of our most precious warfighting asset our marines 
and that he added demands that we be ruthlessly honest with 
ourselves ensure strict accountability and rededicate ourselves to 
excellence

republicans on the senate foreign relations 
committee angered by a democraticled probe into ambassadorial 
nominee donald greggs alleged involvement in the irancontra 
affair are leading a boycott that is paralyzing the panel 
the boycott of committee meetings is preventing action on two 
pending authorization bills providing a total 16 billion 
authorization for foreign aid and state department spending 
democrats say they may retaliate by blocking action on all 
diplomatic and state department appointments including nominations 
for key posts the administration wants to fill quickly 
sen alan cranston dcalif who is spurring the gregg 
investigation told reporters we may not determine anything for 
awhile this committee may not have any hearings on anything 
including gregg 
if this committee cant meet on anything else maybe the 
committee also cant meet on gregg cranston said 
republicans opened the tugofwar on tuesday boycotting a 
working session and preventing action on a pending 45 billion 
authorization bill for the state department and other agencies also 
frozen by the standoff was a twoyear 115 billion foreign aid 
authorization bill 
the investigation is focusing on greggs alleged links to the 
irancontra affair while serving as national security adviser for 
vice president bush 
the key questions are 
did gregg help oliver l north secretly and illegally resupply 
the nicaraguan contra rebels in 1985 
is he lying about it now 
on tuesday eight democrats gathered to try to act on the state 
department bill 
the only republican present was sen jesse helms of north 
carolina the panels ranking gop member and he walked out a 
quorum of 10 members is necessary to permit the committee to act on 
pending legislation or nominations 
its very apparent that we are unable to do business because 
the republicans are objecting to the fact that a legitimate 
committee inquiry is taking place with respect to mr don gregg 
said sen john kerry dmass 
kerry said republicans in the past have held up certain 
nominations for months yet democrats continued to permit the 
committee to get on with its other work 
i think the process is subjected to a kind of tyranny when 
there is this wholesale boycotting kerry said 
i would hope the comity of this institution would not lead to 
other important business being held up he said 
cranston complained that a lack of cooperation from the 
administration is delaying final action on gregg saying he has had 
no response to requests for documents and information relating to 
gregg 
the administration seems to me to be showing some contempt for 
the committee in this particular matter cranston said 
helms said the boycott is being organized by sen mitch 
mcconnell rky who helms said wants a specific date set for 
holding another hearing on gregg and a specific date for voting on 
his nomination 
i dont want any suggestions made that were holding up 
anything helms said sen cranston is holding up hes got 
a vendetta going against mr gregg 
this is an attempt to dredge up irancontra again said helms 
im having a problem on my side because of their discontent over 
what sen cranston is doing i think sen mcconnells indignation is 
well justified 
at that point chairman claiborne pell dri attempted to move 
for action on the pending state department bill 
would helms agree he asked 
helms stood up 
ill see you later mr chairman he said walking from the 
room ive got to defend my side

wives seek divorces nearly twice as often as 
husbands a government study says 
the national center for health statistics reported tuesday that 
615 percent of divorces acted on in 1986 were fought by the wives 
husbands petitioned for 326 percent and the rest were sought 
jointly the report said 
statistician barbara foley wilson expressed surprise that in a 
time when nofault divorces are becoming more common the joint 
petitions amounted to only about 6 percent of the cases 
while the center did not provide an analysis of the reasons for 
the difference between men and women in seeking divorces wilson 
commented that over the years women have traditionally been more 
likely to file divorce petitions 
at one time she said it was considered gentlemanly to allow 
the wife to sue for divorce regardless of which party was at fault 
in the dispute 
various studies she added have showed that it is more often the 
woman who becomes dissatisfied with a marriage than the man 
and the presence of children apparently didnt encourage wives to 
remain in unhappy marriages 
in the breakup of marriages where children were present wives 
filed 657 percent of the divorce petitions while women initiated 
569 percent of the divorces of childless couples 
this was the first time the center for health statistics a 
division of the department of health and human services has 
reported on who initiated divorces 
the figures were included in its detailed final report on divorce 
statistics for 1986 a year that saw 1178000 marriages break up in 
the country 
preliminary reports show that divorces fell to 1157000 in 1987 
and then climbed to 1183000 last year but the reports for 1987 
and 1988 have not been completed in the detail which is included in 
the 1986 report 
while the 1986 report was the first to include figures on who 
initiated the proceeding it did cover the period back to 1975 
indicating that women are becoming somewhat less likely to be the 
one filing the papers than in the past 
in 1975 women filed 672 percent of divorce papers compared 
with 294 percent for men and the rest filed jointly 
that was down to 634 percent by filed by women in 1980 with men 
filing 302 percent that year and the balance filed jointly 
the new study also found that divorces were most likely to occur 
early in marriages with 336 percent taking place between the first 
and fourth years of wedlock 
overall marriages that ended in divorce lasted an average of 96 
years according to the analysis 
the report found that first marriages lasted an average 107 
years before divorce while second marriages ended after an average 
of 67 years third marriages lasted an average 72 years

jack anderson the syndicated columnist is 
being investigated for carrying an unloaded gun into the us 
capitol to demonstrate security lapses congressional authorities 
said 
anderson displayed the handgun and a bullet on may 24 when he 
interviewed senate republican leader bob dole in the capitol for a 
television special on terrorism said dole spokesman walt riker 
riker said anderson claimed to have walked through a metal 
detector with the 9mm austrianmade pistol on his way to doles 
office he pulled out the gun and handed it to the kansas republican 
after dole said in the interview that no place was immune from 
terrorists 
we realized afterward that wed been had that it was an 
oncamera stunt we were taken aback but as we thought about 
it we realized he may have committed a crime said riker 
doles aides turned the bullet which anderson left behind over 
to senate sergeant at arms henry giugni giugni said tuesday that 
the bullet and statements about the incident had been turned over to 
us capitol police and officers from that force were investigating 
the incident along with the us attorneys office 
anderson the following week broadast tape of the interview and 
footage of him walking through a capitol metal detector 
a capitol police duty officer said no spokesman was available to 
discuss the investigation tuesday night there was no answer at 
andersons home 
in an interview broadcast tuesday on washingtons wusatv 
anderson was asked how he would react if he were charged with a 
criminal offense 
i would say that the authorities in washington as usual are 
going after the whistleblower rather than the offense he said 
riker said the news media in general could be hurt by the 
incident 
the ironic thing is anderson through this stunt has hurt the 
media people who have to go through those entrances every day he 
said the legacy of this is the media are going to have a harder 
time 
giugni said screening has been tightened up at the building 
naturally theyre looking more carefully at press passes and 
such we normally give a certain courtesy to reporters trying to get 
through he said

birth control pills pose no increased breast 
cancer risk even for women with a family member who developed the 
disease 
thats the finding of a new study of oral contraceptive use among 
women who have a family history of breast cancer one of the major 
concerns in the medical community about longterm use of th pill 
these data suggest you dont need to be nearly as concerned as 
some people thought previously if you have a very strong family 
history of breast cancer said dr bruce v stadel coauthor of 
the study and a researcher at the uniformed services university of 
the health sciences in bethesda md 
stadel said that women whose mothers sisters daughters aunts 
or grandmothers had breast cancer are known to be at higher risk of 
developing the disease as a result doctors for years have 
recommended that women with such a family history not take birth 
control pills the perception he said was that oral contraceptives 
would aggravate an existing risk 
but the new study relieves this concern said stadel and shows 
oral contraceptive use does not appreciably alter risk of breast 
cancer as far as we have been able to study 
the research published in the journal of the american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists involved an analysis of data 
collected from eight areas of the country by two federal agencies 
for what is called the cancer and steroid hormone study or cash 
the cash research examined the medical histories of 4730 women 
with cancer and 4646 who did not have cancer from these groups 
the new study analyzed the relative risk of breast cancer among oral 
contraceptives users who had a family history of breast cancer in 
comparison with those pill takers who had no family history of 
breast cancer the length of time that oral contraceptives were used 
also was analyzed 
we looked to see if there was a different effect for women with 
a strong family history compared to women with no family history 
said stadel we found no adverse effect from the pill our data 
suggests that oral contraceptive use does not increase the risk of 
breast cancer in women with a family history 
though the research seemed to give definite results stadel said 
there is a need for confirming studies 
this is the largest study of this issue but it is one study 
he said in this sort of research we always like to see the 
building over time of a consensus based on more and more data but 
this is certainly a strong piece in that direction 
steven g silverberg of the georgetown university medical center 
a medical school professor who has researched any connection between 
birth control pills and cancer said the findings confirm a 
continuing sense of confidence in the safety of oral contraceptives 
this is not unexpected he said i would have expected oral 
contraceptives to not be associated with increased risks even for 
women with a family history of breast cancer the birth control 
pills now being prescribed shouldnt pose a high risk of breast 
cancer at all 
other coauthors of the study were pamela p murray and james j 
schlesselman of the uniformed services university of the health 
sciences in bethesda

the internal revenue service is endorsing a 
bill to reduce the number of penalties it can assess against errant 
taxpayers 
the bill by rep jj pickle dtexas is aimed at simplifying 
and eliminating duplication in the penalties which number close to 
150 in current tax law the number has risen from just 25 in 1967 
reflecting to some degree congress use of penalties to raise 
revenue rather than simply to encourage compliance with the tax law 
more than 26 million penalties totaling nearly 6 billion were 
assessed last year 
penalties should exist for the purpose of encouraging voluntary 
compliance michael j murphy acting irs commissioner told 
pickles house ways and means oversight subcommittee tuesday 
murphy suggested the penalty system has been thrown together 
helterskelter unless there is some coherent philosophy underlying 
the structure he said it is very difficult for us as penalty 
administrators to fairly and consistently assert these penalties 
pickles bill murphy said will result in substantial 
improvement to the penalty system we have now 
murphy offered proposals for changing some parts of the bill as 
did several others witnesses who testified overall however the 
witnesses apparently agreed with the position of john j motley iii 
of the national federation of independent business who called the 
bill a great step toward simplifying and clarifying what tax 
penalties exist and when they will be assessed 
under present law a taxpayer can be hit with two or more 
separate penalties for the same violation such as failing to pay 
tax on time pickles bill would eliminate such duplication and 
consolidate different penalties for negligence overvaluation of a 
deduction and understatement of income into one uniform penalty for 
inaccuracy 
the bill would boost to 1000 the current 500 penalty for 
filing a frivolous tax return such as one that claims the income 
tax is unconstitutional 
pickle proposes to sharply increase the penalty for failure to 
file a return on time when the failure is intentional or fraud is 
involved such action could result in a penalty of 15 percent of the 
net amount of tax due per month up to a maximum of 75 percent 
the penalty for failing to file an information return with the 
irs such as a form 1099 statement of interest paid by a bank to a 
depositor would be raised to a level that would depend on when it 
was eventually filed the penalty now is 50 for each failure with 
a maximum of 100000 a year the proposed penalty would vary from 
15 75000 maximum to 50 250000 maximum

members of the house rules committee are 
telling colleagues the panel is unlikely to permit the full house to 
consider more than a few of the 100plus proposed amendments to 
savings and loan bailout legislation 
however it is clear from panel members comments that the 
committee will clear at least one or perhaps a combination of 
several of the 10 proposed amendments that would blunt the tougher 
capital requirements that the bush administration says is the 
cornerstone of its plan to reform the industry 
there seems to be great sympathy throughout the congress to do 
something with this capital rule said rep gerald solomon rny 
the committee which decides the rules for debate of legislation 
in the full house heard in a 4hour session tuesday from 12 house 
members seeking to reshape parts of the sampl bill written in the 
banking ways and means and judiciary committees 
fortyseven members remain on the witness list and the rules 
panel scheduled another session this afternoon and may have to hold 
a third on thursday 
panel members conceded that the flood of amendments means theres 
little hope of meeting house speaker thomas foleys request to move 
the bill to the full house this week they predicted house action 
next week 
that would set the stage for a conference to reconcile the house 
bill with a version passed by the senate in april and send finished 
legislation to president bushs desk in july 
bush administration officials are insisting that the house 
require all sampl owners to risk more of their own capital 3 for 
every 100 in lending as a buffer against losses to the government 
deposit insurance fund 
however rep henry hyde rill and others are arguing that 732 
of the nations 2949 sampls should keep an accounting break known as 
supervisory goodwill which in some cases allows sampl owners to 
operate without risking any of their own money 
according to hyde 241 of the 732 will fail to meet the new 
capital requirements unless they keep the goodwill which regulators 
permitted in the early 1980s as an inducement for merging with 
failing sampls 
hyde wants sampls to have the right to appeal to regulators to keep 
their supervisory goodwill but critics say that could delay the 
imposition of tougher standards for as long as 18 months 
reps frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
subcommittee on financial institutions john lafalce dny a 
member of the banking panel and two members of the rules committee 
rep james h quillen rtenn and solomon are proposing other 
accommodations on goodwill arguing that its unfair for the 
government to renege on previous commitments 
i think its really a bad day in the history of this country 
when we as legislators agree to do away with written agreements the 
government has made quillen said 
however rep jim leach riowa pleaded with the rules committee 
to permit consideration of at least one amendment to strengthen 
capital requirements even further from the 3 percent standard 
favored by the administration leach wants sampl owners to hold 4 
percent tangible capital within two years and five percent after 
five years 
in addition to the capital standards the rules panel was 
expected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the ways 
and means committee to add 50 billion in government borrowing for 
the bailout to the federal budget deficit the administration favors 
a mechanism for keeping it out of the budget deficit

the senate is trying to finish crafting a bill 
funneling 33 billion to veterans college students and other 
groups with some lawmakers hoping to use the measure to block a 
surtax on the elderly 
legislators planned their fourth day of debate on the legislation 
today hoping to complete work on a bill that has garnered a slew of 
provisions on capitol hill since president bush first sought the 
measure in march 
discussion was continuing today on an amendment by sen john 
mccain rariz postponing implementation of much of the new 
catastrophic care program for the elderly under medicare including 
a cap on doctors bills 
mccains proposal also would delay for a year the surtax on 
people 65 or older that is designed to pay for the program that 
levy can reach a maximum of 800 this year for the wealthiest senior 
citizens and some of them have complained that the tax is excessive 
were laying an incredible cost on them for coverage they do 
not want or need at that cost mccain said 
but opposition to mccain came even from his own political party 
i think i know where the crux of the problem comes from 
said sen bob packwood rore ranking republican on the senate 
finance committee they all live in sun city and they all have 
incomes of 30000 to 40000 a year 
sun city is a retirement community in arizona 
democrats said the size of the surtax should be reconsidered 
instead in future legislation 
on wednesday the senate rejected 6929 a proposal by sen jesse 
helms rnc allowing the transportation department to withhold 
aid from communities refusing to let transit projects to companies 
doing business with the proapartheid government of south africa 
lawmakers also adopted by voice vote an amendment by senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine urging congress to revamp 
a tax law that business considers burdensome 
that followed a 5049 defeat for sen robert kasten rwis who 
instead wanted the senate to repeal the tax law which forces 
companies to prove their health benefits are as generous to lowpaid 
workers as they are to executives for technical reasons kasten 
would have needed 60 votes to prevail 
the overall spending bill is designed to provide federal agencies 
with enough money to see them through the sept 30 end of fiscal 
1989 
it would pump 12 billion to veterans programs 892 million for 
guaranteed student loans for college students and 225 million for 
food stamps it would finance other costs including those for soviet 
refugees moving to this country last years forest fires foster 
care and united nations peacekeeping efforts 
the measure also is studded with provisions directing federal 
resources at projects important to individual lawmakers 
thus it would prevent a school district in sumter county sc 
from losing about 700000 in federal education aid this year it 
would otherwise forfeit the provision was sponsored by sen ernest 
hollings dsc a member of the appropriations committee 
other clauses would order the army to spend 50 million this year 
on cold weather clothes manufactured in 10 states provide puerto 
rican political parties with 15 million to conduct a referendum on 
the islands future political status and distribute 66 million in 
subsidies to airlines that serve small communities in 39 states 
the house passed a 37 billion version of the bill on may 24 
two months after bush sought legislation totaling 22 billion 
the two chambers will have to agree to a compromise before 
sending a bill to the white house for bushs signature

a landmark measure to create a direct tax 
on households and businesses to support child care was failing in 
early returns tuesday as cities and childcare advocates nationwide 
watched 
with 27 of 84 precincts reporting the vote was 3218 against the 
measure to 858 for 
the measure which faced an uphill battle to win passage by a 
twothirds majority would raise 18 million a year from residents 
businesses developers and the citys own coffers to open care 
centers at 30 elementary schools 
the program in this city of 165000 on the east side of san 
francisco bay also would help sick kids and subsidize poor parents 
for babysitting costs 
cities around the country are looking to the fremont example to 
see whether taxpayers are willing to pay for child care said john 
kyle director of the children and families and cities project of 
the national league of cities in washington 
people in 80 percent of all cities are saying child care is the 
most pressing need for children from birth to 9 years old he 
said cities are looking for ways to handle that need and 
resources are the biggest barrier to providing good services 
about 100 cities offer some kind of support for child care kyle 
said some simply coordinate programs or offer training others 
spend money through general funds federal community block grants or 
developer fees 
fremonts measure is the only example i know about of a 
dedicated tax for any services having to do with children kyle 
said this is on the forefront of things to come in the future 
the measure would impose a 12 annual tax on every homeowner 
with renters exempt and a 20 percent business tax surcharge it 
would expire in 15 years 
the vote in fremont will indicate how deep public support is 
for child care said abby cohen managing attorney for the child 
care law center in san francisco 
we all have magnifying glasses and were watching it very 
carefully said deborah simon coordinator of san joses office on 
child care 
the national league of cities which has 1400 member cities and 
49 state and municipal members representing an additional 14000 
cities said many cities are watching closely 
advocacy groups see fremont as an example of what can be done 
to deal with a need that is felt in all cities kyle said its 
not just something for the rich or poor lots of people need it 
this measure will make city governments think about this problem

more proof of the danger is needed before 
governments launch programs seeking to correct the greenhouse 
warming of the planet a pair of scientists is cautioning 
there does seem to have been a warming over the last 100 years 
but too much uncertainty remains about the causes of that change to 
justify immediate government action said robert jastrow former 
head of nasas goddard institute for space studies 
the effect of clouds is not well understood and the small 
warming recorded so far could easily be a result of normal climate 
variability or changes in the brightness of the sun explained the 
former national aeronautics and space administration scientist 
current forecasts of the manmade greenhouse effect do not 
appear to be sufficiently accurate to be used as a basis for sound 
national policy decisions said jastrow 
jastrow made his comments in releasing the study scientific 
perspectives on the greenhouse problem the report was presented 
by jastrow and frederick seitz a former president of the national 
science foundation and of rockefeller university a third coauthor 
william a nierenberg of the scripps institute of oceanography 
could not attend the news conference on tuesday 
the study was published by the george c marshall institute in 
washington the institute funded by foundation grants conducts 
research on public policy issues said jastrow 
in recent years the threat of greenhouse warming has attracted 
considerable attention with some scientists warning that it could 
raise the earths temperature changing the climate turning major 
farm areas into dust bowls and melting the polar ice caps causing a 
rise in sea levels 
the warming would result from increases in gases such as carbon 
dioxide and methane in the atmosphere these gases allow warmth from 
the sun to pass through to the earth but block outgoing radiation 
raising the planets temperature in somewhat the same way a 
greenhouse warms its interior 
james hansen jastrows successor at goddard has been a leader 
in this research warning that the effect may already be observable 
in studies indicating the planet is about 1 degree fahrenheit warmer 
now than it was a century ago 
that conclusion has been widely debated with various climate 
experts differing on the effect of clouds urban growth and other 
factors in changing average temperatures 
we dont believe he has overstated the risks of this 
warming commented jastrow of hansens work 
but jastrow added the one place we part company is the 
ability to forecast the next century from what we know now 
jastrow recommended increased research spending to determine the 
extent of the danger if any 
research facilities costing 100 million or so could help provide 
these answers in three to five years he said still plenty of time 
to act if it is found that a gloabl warming is indeed underway

the organization of american states gave a team 
of mediators an additional six weeks to work out a democratic 
transition in panama but a top panamanian official said no solution 
is possible so long as his country is permanently threatened by 
the united states 
oas foreign ministers met tuesday night to review the situation 
in panama three weeks after they authorized envoys from ecuador 
guatemala and trinidad to try to work out a democratic transfer of 
power in panama 
during almost four hours of debate tuesday night there was 
little sign that the mediators had come close to fulfilling that 
goal tuesday was their original target date and their new deadline 
under the extension is july 19 
panamas foreign minister jorge ritter told reporters after the 
session that his government had no intention of moving toward a 
solution so long as the united states maintained economic sanctions 
and continually threatened panama with the use of force 
there can be no normal political process under the current 
circumstances in panama he said 
the crisis in panama grew out of the decision by authorities 
there to declare national elections null and void three days after 
they were held on may 7 
international observers claimed that the government committed 
fraud on a massive scale depriving opponents of the 
militarydominated government of a 31 victory at the polls some of 
the opposition candidates were brutally beaten 
with the scrapping of the election returns a crisis of 
legitimacy has been created which the oas has been attempting to 
address but with the passing of almost a month since the crisis 
reached a peak some of the hemispheric indignation over the 
continued rule of panamanian military leader manuel antonio noriega 
has dissipated 
lawrence eagleburger the us undersecretary of state for 
political affairs said the oas must take account of charter 
provisions calling for the establishment of representative democracy 
as a guiding hemispheric principle 
the oas must show that the charter is not mere words he said 
eagleburger assailed noriega and said that the oas must consider 
further action against panama if progress toward democracy is 
not achieved quickly 
noriega is the problem he said 
sept 1 has become a guidepost for the oas mediators because 
that is the day on which the panamanian constitution says a new 
president must take office 
the current president is manuel solis palma a noriega ally but 
the united states recognizes the president ousted 15 months ago by 
noriegas supporters in the national assembly eric arturo delvalle 
ritter recounted what he described as the series of abuses 
committed by the united states since delvalles ouster these 
include the freezing of panamanian assets abroad and us refusal to 
pay panama a single cent on operations relating to the panama 
canal 
the united states has contributed to the destruction of panamas 
economy ritter said 
he noted that president bush authorized the dispatch of an 
additional 2000 us combat troops to panama last month after the 
elections and said one consequence is that the civilian population 
lives in fear of us military attack 
ritter did not oppose the extension of the oas mandate the only 
opposition came from nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto 
who said no extension was appropriate without the explicit support 
of panama 
much of the day was spent discussing the propriety of giving the 
mediators a reporting deadline or making their mission openended 
the mediators were said to oppose the imposition of a deadline 
but the united states and other delegates argued that an openended 
mission would ease pressure on noriega

for filipinos the bloody attacks on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in china have served as a shocking 
vision of what could have happened to their own people power 
revolution three years ago 
commentators and officials have also taken advantage of the 
massacre of hundreds and possibly thousands of chinese to discredit 
filipino communists who have have patterned their 20year 
insurgency on the chinese peoples war that brought the late mao 
tsetung to power 40 years ago 
newspaper and broadcast commentators have drawn parallels between 
the turmoil in beijing and the events of february 1986 when 
hundreds of thousands of filipinos poured into the streets to 
protect military officers who had mutineed against president 
ferdinand marcos 
marcos ordered his troops to suppress the mutiny but marcos 
troops refused to fire on civilians who included nuns priests and 
students on feb 25 1986 marcos fled manila for exile in hawaii 
the only casualties were three promarcos soldiers slain 
defending the government television station against mutineers 
there but for the grace of god we might have gone in february 
1986 when that glorious buzzword people power was invented 
wrote columnist max soliven in the philippine star of the carnage in 
beijing 
in that crucial moment that crossroads of history the 
philippine armed forces chose to side with the people rather than 
with our tyrant 
in the years since marcos fled president corazon aquino and 
other filipino leaders have attributed the success of their 
revolution to factors ranging from the power of the people 
to intercession by the virgin mary 
in 1986 we were all praying because we are all christians 
said cardinal jaime l sin who called civilians into the streets 
three years ago to us a man is indeed very valuable even 
soldiers loyal to marcos felt that their obligation is toward their 
country 
some filipino commentators also believe the key was american 
diplomatic pressure after supporting marcos for years us 
diplomats warned him not to use force and finally offered him safe 
haven in hawaii 
no foreign government has such leverage with the chinese 
meanwhile the military has already begun using the events in 
beijing as a propaganda weapon against the underground communist 
party of the philippines 
defense secretary fidel ramos said tuesday that the events in 
china prove that communism is a discredited philosophy 
in a statement monday cardinal sin said the savagery in beijing 
should serve as a warning to filipinos who support the rebels 
please open your eyes to the reality that communism can only 
make our lives more miserable he said

it happens every year at the supreme court a 
springtime silly season when rampant rumors reign 
because the nations highest court often waits until late in its 
octoberjune term to issue decisions in the most closely watched 
cases anticipation gets the best of some 
this years first rumor bubbled up late last week when prochoice 
and antiabortion forces were convinced a decision in a key abortion 
case would be announced monday 
the court is being asked in a missouri dispute to overturn or 
curtail its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion 
no one could pinpoint the rumors origin but news reporters 
lawyers and political activists helped spread it quickly throughout 
the capital city 
the television networks with livetransmission equipment outside 
the court building and correspondents wired for sound were poised 
to break into their midmorning programming monday 
the decision was a noshow 
such rumors about the timing of decisions often assertedly based 
on some unnamed knowledgeable source have an amazing track record 
they are never ever correct but much like a stopped watch some 
day 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
including the missouri abortion case the court has 51 decisions 
to announce before beginning its summer recess to date since 
october it has issued 85 signed decisions 
the terms last scheduled day is june 26 but chief justice 
william h rehnquist has the option of extending it 
under former chief justice warren e burger the court term often 
stretched into early july but the rehnquist court has wrapped up 
the last two terms on june 26 and june 29 respectively 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when rehnquist appeared at a house committee hearing last month 
to support a proposed 30 percent pay raise for all federal judges 
there was some uncertainty among court and congressional officials 
about just when a chief justice had last testified before congress 
speculation centered on william howard taft and charles evans hughes 
answer the late chief justice harlan f stone testified before 
the house judiciary committee on june 24 1943 about the high 
courts workload 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a recent speech to the australian bar association the current 
chief justice voiced concern about the number of lawyers surrounding 
some legal disputes 
obviously if a client wishes this sort of massed battalions of 
lawyers on his side and is willing to pay for them presumably no 
one else is the worse for it rehnquist said but i have a sense 
that often law firms impose this sort of a regimen upon a client 
without it being requested 
there is no question in my mind that these developments 
have driven up the cost of legal services in the united states in 
the past 35 years out of proportion to inflation he said

the precode practice of denying postpetition interest to

in an unprecedented report submitted to 
parliament the government has revealed that many of the major 
contributors to israels political parties in last years national 
elections were foreigners 
the report only gave the first initial last name and sum 
contributed for the 20 largest givers but the list included figures 
from the united states canada france and spain state comptroller 
miriam ben porat said 
she would not elaborate on the contributors identities 
the report submitted tuesday by mrs ben porat publicly 
revealed for the first time the names of political contributors 
israels two major political parties the leftleaning labor 
party and the rightwing likud have long opposed any efforts to 
disclose the names of large contributors saying it would inhibit 
contributions 
the report named charles bronfman of canada as the largest single 
contributor he gave 13 million to labor the second largest 
donor jean friedman of france gave 415000 also to the labor 
party 
although corporate contributions are outlawed there is no 
ceiling on private donations 
speaking before the report was formally issued former labor 
party secretarygeneral uzi baram said to my knowledge there is 
no other example in the world where most of the donations that are 
made to political parties dont come from the same nation where the 
elections are held 
mrs ben porat said she released the report to prevent large 
contributors from trying to influence israeli politics 
if we know about these contributors and god forbid one of 
them sees it as an investment and wants it to be realized the 
public can come and help me so it doesnt happen mrs ben porat 
said 
the report listed the names of all contributors who donated more 
than 31000 to political parties after august 20 ms ben porat 
first notified parties that the names of contributors would be 
published on that date 
the election was held nov 1 
the report lists 14 contributors who together gave 28 million 
to labor and five who together gave 405000 to the likud 
one contributor from austria gave 100000 to the leftwing 
citizens rights movement 
the report did not include the names of three donators one gave 
250000 to the likud and two gave a total of 470000 to labor 
ms ben porat agreed to withhold publication of their names when 
leaders from labor and likud said they were in sensitive positions 
in foreign countries and publication of their names could endanger 
their lives 
the report said israels 17 political parties raised a total of 
418 million with likud and labor both gathering almost 15 
million

voters decided to close the rancho seco 
nuclear power plant on tuesday marking the first time an electorate 
has chosen to shut down an operating reactor 
with absentee ballots in and all precincts reporting 112138 or 
534 percent voted to close the troubled plant while 97698 or 466 
percent voted to keep it open 
election officials had projected a heavy special election turnout 
of up to 50 percent of the 529658 registered voters in the 
sacramento municipal utility district which operates the plant 25 
miles southeast of californias capital 
voters in the district that includes most of sacramento county 
and parts of placer county gave the plant a reprieve in june 1988 
but put it on probation until the election this year 
though the vote was not binding on the utility district a 
majority of its elected board members said they would follow the 
will of the people 
</TEXT>

rancho seco critics feared the 15yearold facility was unsafe 
and they were angered by rising utility bills they also pointed to 
a 400 million repair bill after a 1985 accident in which the 
reactor was cooled too fast raising fears of structural damage and 
causing a 27month shutdown 
supporters said the 913megawatt plants bad days were over since 
it had been overhauled and had new management 
for the past 17 years opponents of atomic power have tried 
unsuccessfully to shut down nuclear power plants by appealing to 
voters 
while nuclear opponents have failed to persuade voters to close 
down any existing plants they have won elections that prevented new 
nuclear plants from being built in some states 
the industry fearful that closing one of the few publicly owned 
nuclear power plants in the nation could strengthen the hand of 
critics of privately owned plants elsewhere raised 580000 to push 
for its continued operation 
opponents which included the campaign california environmental 
group formed by assemblyman tom hayden and his estranged wife jane 
fonda raised 111000 according to the latest campaign reports 
since its restart in april 1988 the plant has been nagged by a 
series of mechanical problems that shut it down or forced cutbacks 
in power production overall since restart the plant has run at 
about 47 percent of its operating capacity 
but plant spokesmen kerry shearer said the plant had won praise 
from the nuclear regulatory commission for improvements since the 
accident and that the restart last year was one of the smoothest in 
the industry 
greg cooke a nuclear regulatory commission spokesman said other 
ballot measures aimed at closing or blocking nuclear power plants 
all had been voted down more than a dozen such measures have 
appeared on ballots around the country in the last 14 years 
last november voters in massachusetts turned back a referendum 
that would have prohibited the generation of nuclear wastes the 
measure was aimed at forcing the closure of the states two nuclear 
plants

striking miners marching through west 
virginia this week are selfconsciously following the path of the 
united mine workers in its bloody fight to unionize the appalachian 
coal fields 70 years ago 
its the same struggle said david whitman a delegate in the 
state legislature and umw member who was among 60 miners marching 
tuesday were not facing rifles but theyre using the courts and 
economics on us 
since early april the umw has been battling pittston coal group 
inc in virginia and west virginia more than 2000 miners and their 
wives have been arrested for civil disobedience and the union has 
been fined millions of dollars 
in 1921 the union faced the rifles of federal troops in the 
bloody fiveday battle of blair mountain where 50 marchers were 
camped out tuesday night 
the union lost the original fight but retrenched and later won 
the right to organize workers in southern west virginia during the 
great depression 
they lost the battle but they won the war said terry 
collins a pittston employee for eight years before the strike 
the strikers this week were marching 85 miles north to 
charleston where they will be joined at a rally by machinists 
hoping to call attention to their strike against eastern airlines 
jesse jackson is the featured speaker at the rally gov gaston 
caperton a democrat who won election last year with union support 
has not said whether he will attend 
were going to charleston to see what side of the fence the 
governors on said marcher john tomblin 35 
about 1500 pittston workers walked out april 5 after working 14 
months without a contract more than 100 miners with the new beckley 
coal co also have been off their jobs since january in a related 
dispute 
pittston miners claim the company which refused to go along with 
an industrywide umw agreement and has kept its mines open with 
nonunion labor is trying to break the union by reducing job 
security and setting up an independent pension fund 
pittston officials say they want to maintain a union shop but 
with more flexible work rules permitting greater subcontracting and 
sevenday work weeks to meet growing competition from nonunion and 
foreign companies 
both sides say the outcome of the strike could affect contract 
negotiations throughout the coal industry 
miners started their march tuesday with a 10mile trek from logan 
to the summit of blair mountain the route was lined with large 
signs proclaiming we support the umwa 
the marchers said they were carrying on the work of the miners 
who faced federal troops 68 years ago after marching from marmet 
south to the mountain this years march reverses that path 
they passed this way to win what they got so were passing 
this way to keep what weve got tomblin said 
the battle of blair mountain had its start in the southern west 
virginia coal fields during the early 1900s when miners rebelled 
against industry policies that kept them in check with companyowned 
stores and housing and oppressive unsafe work conditions 
the conflict led to the matewan massacre on may 19 1920 in 
which 10 people were killed including seven coal company detectives 
and matewans mayor the next year mingo county sheriff sid 
hatfield a defender of the union was shot and killed at the 
mcdowell county courthouse where he was standing trial for murder in 
connection with the matewan shootout 
upon news of hatfields death miners marched to the mountain and 
were confronted by federal troops called in from kentucky and 
virginia in the ensuing battle three union men died and 40 men from 
both sides were wounded 
the union says it is committed to nonviolent methods today but 
equally committed to beating pittston 
weve got all the berries in one basket collins said 
were not planning on losing

scores of federal agents seized records at the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant as the government announced a 
criminal investigation of possible environmental violations at the 
facility 
investigators were checking allegations that employees treated 
stored and disposed of hazardous wastes without permits falsely 
certified federal environmental reports and concealed environmental 
contamination said us attorney mike norton in denver 
norton said 75 agents from the fbi and the environmental 
protection agencys office of criminal investigations began 
searching the plant tuesday morning the probe is expected to last 
six months to a year 
federal officials declined to say what prompted the search at the 
plant identified last year by the department of energy as the most 
environmentally hazardous site in the nuclear weapons industry 
because of contamination of an underground reservoir 
officials stressed that no new dangers existed at the plant 
which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons 
it is absolutely essential that the public understand that this 
investigation does not signal any major new environmental safety or 
health concern attorney general dick thornburgh said in a 
statement issued in washington 
rep david skaggs dcolo whose district encompasses rocky 
flats said the implications of the swarm of investigators at the 
plant is the department of justice had some reason to believe they 
would be risking destruction of evidence if they didnt act in that 
fashion 
he told the associated press he has heard there were several 
informants that became the basis for the fbidepartment of justice 
investigation and thats been going on for the better part of a 
year 
the plant 16 miles northwest of denver is operated for the doe by 
rockwell international corp 
investigators are examining actions by both government and 
rockwell employees the new york times reported 
a spokesman for rockwell said the company had advised employees 
to cooperate with investigators but declined to comment further 
rocky flats has been dogged by environmental problems doe 
inspectors closed the plants main plutonium reprocessing building 
last october for four months because of safety violations the doe 
also issued a report last december that revealed 32 new safety 
problems 
thornburgh said he authorized disclosure of the investigation 
because the search was a matter of public record 
skaggs a staunch critic of rocky flats operations said there 
was apparent reason to believe a number of individuals at the 
plant were involved in concert in the effort to falsify and mislead 
with regard to environmental compliance issues 
energy secretary admiral james d watkins in a statement said 
his department will perform an independent analysis of rocky flats 
operations and ensure that continued operations regardless of 
past practices are conducted in a safe and environmentally sound 
manner 
he also said part of the plant would be shut down as a result of 
the investigation but he offered no specifics in the statement 
watkins said he was suspending those operations for which 
safety could be adversely affected by the presence and functioning 
of the department of justice investigating team 
gov roy romer a democrat who has prodded federal officials to 
deal with rocky flats radioactive waste disposal problems was 
informed of the investigation only an hour before it was announced 
romer said he was assured he would be notified immediately of any 
new dangers 
im outraged by the possibility that some criminal action may 
have occurred at rocky flats romer told a news conference shortly 
after the federal announcement 
i have been trying to say to people this is an operation that 
were monitoring closely and its not endangering your health today 
i have to say to people wait a minute i dont know yet romer 
said

deng xiaoping 84 who ordered troops to march on the capital to 
suppress prodemocracy unrest is the most powerful leader in china 
even though the highest ranking position he holds is chairman of the 
central military commission of the ruling communist party the 
commission not the defense ministry has the final say on military 
matters 
deng was purged twice by radicals during the 196676 cultural 
revolution and then staged a comeback that transformed china from a 
country dominated by ideological battles into one with pragmatic 
marketoriented economic policies living standards have improved 
for millions of chinese but the modernization drive has led to 
serious problems of inflation and corruption 
deng has been out of sight since may 16 chinese sources say he 
has been hospitalized for treatment of prostate cancer the 
government denied a report tuesday that deng had died calling it a 
fabrication designed to make people uneasy and create chaos

stock prices rose sharply in tokyo today while the 
dollar edged up against the japanese yen amid uncertainties over 
turmoil in china dealers said 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
which slipped 507 points tuesday rose 17488 points or 052 
percent closing at 3362689 the index had fallen four straight 
days since thursday 
the dollar ended trading at 14280 yen up 017 yen from 
tuesdays 14263yen finish after opening at 14245 yen the 
currency ranged between 14240 and 14300 yen 
toru kanai foreign exchange analyst with new japan securities 
co said the unstable chinese situation encouraged dollar buying 
but speculation that the us federal reserve board might cut 
interest rates also gave participants a reason to sell the us 
currency 
we had a lot of dollar buying because many investors believe 
the us money is a safe investment in time of emergencies he 
said but they didnt want to hold too many dollars either because 
of expectations the fed might cut its interest rates soon 
investors speculate the federal reserve may ease its monetary 
policy following the cut in the prime lending rate on monday by 
major us banks 
kanai said there were unconfirmed rumors that the bank of japan 
intervened in the market to support the yen when the dollar hit the 
143yen mark it had no impact on the market he said 
the central bank usually does not comment officially on its 
market interventions 
on the stock market dealers said the nikkei index began to rise 
as investors picked up cheap issues following the four days of 
losses 
but trading was basically directionless because of uncertainties 
over political unrest in china which made many institutional 
investors remain on the sidelines said a trader with a major 
securities firm 
speculative buying pushed up the index he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
trading was moderate with volume on the markets first section 
estimated at 600 million shares up from tuesdays 550 million 
shares among the winners were steel and construction issues

theres no periscope and there is water 
inside but a twoman submarine built by students is mits bet to 
crack the eightminute kilometer and win the first international 
submarine race 
after months of planning and production the cigarshaped icarus 
was launched tuesday on its first voyage in the alumni pool of the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
they didnt go very fast swimmers lapped them 
cliff goudey mit sea grant college program project director 
said the 5000 top prize was a major incentive to enter the 
onekilometer race off florida later this month 
when the prize was announced the idea of winning combined 
with the reputation mit has in doing well in these kinds of things 
was motivation enough to get us involved goudey said we all 
want to be heroes 
the twoperson submarines trial run didnt get off to a flying 
start 
students in the project evan mead al cangahuala and anthony 
joseph all 23 patrick nee 22 and russell cohn 18 added and 
removed small floats to the submarine to balance it under water the 
crafts nose was too light then too heavy then too light 
after about 30 minutes of tinkering the crew began slowly 
propelling the icarus back and forth with mead providing the legwork 
for the pedalpowered craft 
swimmers on the other side of the pool easily lapped the 
submarine during its first efforts but as navigator cangahuala and 
mead hit their stride the icarus began picked up speed 
the threeday race beginning june 23 off west palm beach is 
sponsored by the ha perry foundation a nonprofit scientific 
foundation created to inspire development of undersea technology 
through education research and experimentation 
the mit entry will be up against 18 other submarines from 16 
colleges or engineering firms 
mead said the mit crew will use ringers or athletes to 
pedal the submarine the subs are wet or waterfilled meaning 
the pilot and first mate will have to wear scuba equipment 
if greek mythology has anything to do with it the mit entry 
could be the favorite to win the competition according to legend 
icarus and his father daedalus attempted humanpowered flight 
while daedalus stayed aloft icarus plunged into the sea

a democratic congressman seeking to avenge a 
narrow defeat eight years ago and a republican who vanquished seven 
rivals in the primary won the right to battle for governor 
democrats on tuesday overwhelmingly nominated rep james florio 
while his congressional colleague james courter won the gop 
nomination in a far closer race 
elsewhere voters for the first time decided to shut down an 
operating nuclear power plant a measure that would have kept open 
the troubled rancho seco plant in sacramento calif was rejected 
by 534 percent to 466 percent 
the vote was not binding on the sacramento municipal utility 
district but the plant operators said they would begin shutting 
down the plant today 
looming budget problems soaring auto insurance rates and high 
property taxes promise to dominate campaigning for new jerseys nov 
7 gubernatorial election 
florio is making his third try at the governors office he lost 
to republican gov thomas h kean in 1981 by a heartbreaking 1797 
votes out of 23 million cast florio ran third in the 1977 
democratic primary 
courter emerged from a tight fourway primary battle to score a 
surprisingly decisive victory winning by nearly 27000 votes 
the state republican committee already has targeted florio with 
statewide mailings of news clippings that describe his role as a 
political powerbroker in his district in camden across the state 
line from philadelphia 
courter said he is optimistic and wasted no time in jabbing at 
his opponents longtime ambitions 
jim florio has been running for governor nearly 14 years now 
courter said 
florio said he did not care which republican won tuesday 
i am looking forward to taking charge of an outofcontrol 
state government we need someone who knows the answer is not new 
taxes but the courage and willingness to make hard decisions 
we will ease the crushing burden of outrageous property taxes on the 
citizens of this state he said 
since losing to kean florio has carefully built solid support 
among democrats and has softened his image he was perceived as 
brusque and aloof in the 1981 race 
florio and courter ran on antitax platforms and attacked the 
rapid growth of the state budget which doubled during the kean 
administration 
in washington courter supported president reagans strategic 
defense initiative and distinguished himself on the armed services 
committee while florio gained a national reputation as a fighter 
for the environment and author of the superfund cleanup law 
in the gop primary courter was attacked by one opponent for his 
dismal attendance record in congress this year and most of his 
republican foes charged he knows little about state issues 
former attorney general cary edwards assembly speaker chuck 
hardwick and state sen william gormley were in a close battle for 
second place sen gerald cardinale ran a distant fifth while three 
other republicans shared about 3 percent of the vote 
with 5817 of 5845 precincts or 99 percent reporting courter 
had 110852 votes or 29 percent edwards had 84124 votes or 22 
percent hardwick had 81193 votes or 21 percent gormley had 
65684 votes or 17 percent and cardinale had 32159 votes or 8 
percent 
florio beat his challengers in all 21 counties scoring the most 
decisive democratic primary win since 1965 he maintained a low 
profile during the campaign against princeton mayor barbara sigmund 
and assemblyman alan karcher 
with 5818 of 5845 precincts reporting or 99 percent florio 
had 248059 votes or 68 percent sigmund had 60470 votes or 17 
percent and karcher had 55929 votes or 15 percent 
kean by law was not allowed to seek a third consecutive fouryear 
term

former philippine president ferdinand marcos was 
said to be resting comfortably after emergency surgery for an 
abdominal infection but his prognosis for recovery remains poor a 
hospital spokesman said 
during tuesdays threehour operation at st francis medical 
center surgeons drained a pancreatic abscess the suspected source 
of the persistent infection said eugene tiwanak the hospitals 
assistant administrator 
following surgery marcos 71 remained in very critical 
condition as he has been since may 18 when he was readmitted to the 
intensive care unit with a variety of serious ailments tiwanak said 
an infection had plagued marcos for the past few weeks doctors 
believed it was centered in his abdomen but were not sure of its 
exact location tiwanak said 
they felt his condition was worsening and they needed to do the 
exploratory surgery he said adding they were not certain if 
there are other sources of infection 
doctors hoped to see some improvement in his condition today he 
said 
marcos agreed to the surgery after doctors explained that tests 
indicated an infection said marcos aide arturo aruiza 
they did it cautiously they went through several xrays and 
several scans first aruiza said the surgery was a good call 
joe lazo an ardent supporter said he saw marcos after the 
surgery and saw him resting comfortably he is sleeping but he 
looks good 
marcos wife imelda was at his bedside tuesday night lazo said 
marcos who was hospitalized jan 15 has been suffering from 
kidney and heart failure pneumonia and bacterial infections and has 
been undergoing kidney dialysis he breathes with the aid of a 
respirator 
on may 23 his doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive 
marcos has lived in honolulu since his ouster from the 
philippines in a popular revolt in february 1986 
his illness has prevented him from traveling to new york to face 
racketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than 
100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in the 
united states 
mrs marcos who also is charged last month appealed to 
philippine president corazon aquino to allow her husband to die in 
his homeland the request was denied

the ducks have been dumped and 
their supporters are crying foul 
the few muscovy ducks that have survived a 17monthold feud over 
their presence in this north florida coastal community were exiled 
by commissioners at a latenight session monday unattended by most 
produck forces 
on a 32 vote the city commission banished the half dozen 
remaining muscovies and disbanded a committee that had been formed 
to resolve the dispute 
no destination or departure date has been decided for the ducks 
which once numbered near 150 but dwindled after some residents 
complained the large fowls defecated profusely and harassed other 
animals 
the duck debate became a cause celebre in january 1988 when the 
commission voted to reduce the muscovy population from 150 to 20 
the ducks were caught and taken to farms or residences outside the 
city and eggs were destroyed 
in late august a muscovy swooped down and attacked a city 
commissioner and his family 
in december produckers accused antiduckers of running over the 
birds with their cars one duck was found with its legs chopped off 
commissioner tom wilson didnt present his resolution to oust the 
muscovies until shortly before midnight monday because the 
commission had a twohour public hearing on a new veterinary clinic 
the ducks have to go said wilson 
loud mouths and money have talked against the ducks and we 
cant match that said jim vanairsdale the only produck 
committee member to witness the vote im really taken aback 
some people are mad as hell about it said commissioner pete 
dodson who also backed the birds

mothers arms by the force of the drop with one plucked out of the 
air by a man who lunged to catch her the other woman couldnt find 
her baby for several minutes said passenger james jorgenson 29 a 
racine wis printing engineer 
there was a woman in front of the plane holding a baby and i 
saw that baby bounce off the ceiling he said i thought we were 
done i thought it was all over it was that violent seats were 
broken and luggage racks were broken 
it felt like death said passenger james phillips the 
president of a wisconsin equipment company 
others on united flight 90 which was carrying 232 passengers and 
11 crew members said they felt like they were riding in a roller 
coaster or a dropping elevator 
anything that wasnt tied down flew up to bounce off the 
ceiling jorgenson said 
four people were admitted to hospitals after the plane landed at 
about 7 pm at ohare international airport in chicago authorities 
said hospital spokesmen said they were in stable or good condition 
three suffered head neck shoulder or back injuries while a fourth 
suffered chest pains they said 
other injured passengers were treated and released 
united spokesman joe hopkins said the plane was over garden city 
kan when it encountered clearair turbulence which means the 
pilot couldnt see it 
the flight attendants said it lasted less than a minute but 
apparently the turbulence was pretty severe hopkins said 
jorgenson who was returning from an aborted trip to china said 
he appreciated the irony of fleeing a riot in beijing only to be 
knocked around in kansas

france will cut back its nuclear test program in a 
move to limit rising defense costs premier michel rocard told a 
parliamentary committee 
in a written statement released tuesday rocard told the national 
assemblys defense committee of the reduction plan but no details 
were given france conducts nuclear tests at its pacific center at 
mururoa atoll 
new zealand reported that france exploded a 20kiloton nuclear 
device sunday at an underground site in french polynesia believed to 
be muraroa it was the third french nuclear test this year and the 
106th in frances underground series 
the governments policy is to neither confirm nor deny reports of 
its nuclear tests rocards statement did not say how many tests the 
french had planned to carry out or how great the reduction would be 
president francois mitterrand announced may 24 that the defense 
budget would be cut 25 billion over the next two years but the 
defense budget still will increase by about 3 percent next year and 
4 percent in 1991 
rocards statement also said 
the launching of a new generation of missilelaunching submarines 
would be set back about six months work on the new rafale fighter 
will be delayed for about two years and a battlefield radar 
surveillance system called orchidee will be delayed a year 
in other reductions the statement said the number of fighter 
planes destined for the armed forces would be cut from 33 to 28 
units and the number of light transport vehicles to be delivered to 
the army would be lowered 
to avoid price drifts and financial approximations on major 
programs a new external auditing system will be in place in the 
autumn rocard said 
it will be jointly directed by an army controller and an 
inspector of finance and will be able to call on private auditing 
agencies

a bank is offering lowinterest loans for 
the startup or expansion of daycare centers to make child care 
more widely available to working parents 
the biggest why is that we just really feel like it is the 
right thing to do because there is as we perceived it a 
continuing need for quality daycare facilities in the state said 
h dabney smith a vice president of ncnb south carolina a regional 
bank 
the bank will lend money to operators of licensed childcare 
programs at the banks own cost of funds on monday that would have 
meant 853 percent for a 15year loan or nearly 3 percentage points 
below the prime rate 
some of the loans will be guaranteed by the us small business 
administration 
its a fairly new concept smith said there have been 
other things in other states with various governmental agencies 
being involved but this is the first thing we know of that a bank 
has actually gone out and tried to do something to be of 
assistance 
the program is limited to south carolina for now but smith said 
that if it is successful north carolinabased ncnb might expand it 
to some of the other six states in which it operates 
a spokesman for the american bankers association said he hadnt 
heard of any similar loan programs 
sally hardy of yes inc a columbia childcare resource and 
referral agency said the program was important symbolically and 
financially 
i know of childcare providers who quite frankly would expand 
with this fund who are waiting to take advantage of something like 
this she said the fact that a major bank would come out and 
make a commitment like this is certainly symbolic of the community 
need 
the program also won praise from the office of gov carroll 
campbell who backed a compromise childcare measure passed earlier 
this month to give tax breaks to businesses that offer childcare 
programs to their employees 
i think it very clearly dovetails with the legislative 
initiatives of this year which clearly focus on private sector 
involvement in expanding daycare opportunities said tucker 
eskew campbells spokesman

a 600yearold landmark oak was 
intentionally poisoned with a treekilling herbicide officials said 
its obviously not an accident said john giedraitis a city 
forester who has been directing efforts to save the treaty oak 
under whose branches legend has it stephen f austin the father of 
texas signed a treaty with the indians in the 1800s 
the oak with a branch spread of more than 100 feet lost most of 
its spring leaves but is putting out new leaves 
the texas department of agriculture which has been investigating 
the incident said initial test results pointed to a strong 
herbicide 
its pretty nasty this chemical is used to kill trees its 
not used to kill weeds they knew what they were doing giedraitis 
said its a pretty senseless act 
treatment of the tree last week consisted of replacing 
contaminated soil and injecting charcoal and bacteria into the 
ground to neutralize the chemical 
no more treatment is planned unless the oak situated in a park 
loses its second set of leaves

real estate tycoon harry b helmsley is mentally 
incompetent to stand trial on tax evasion charges a judge ruled 
us district judge john walker on tuesday severed helmsley from 
the trial of his wife and two others after finding that the 
80yearold hotel magnate cannot assist in his defense because of 
memory lapses and reasoning difficulties 
the judge did not dismiss the 47count indictment against 
helmsley only delayed his trial indefinitely 
but noting that medical experts expect helmsleys mental 
deterioration to continue the judge said for all practical 
purposes todays order will remain the final ruling in the 
governments case against this defendant 
citing several doctors including a courtappointed 
neuropsychologist walker said helmsleys condition had been 
aggravated by a series of slight strokes 
helmsley and his 68yearold wife leona were indicted in april 
on charges they evaded personal income taxes by disguising about 4 
million in renovations to their greenwich conn mansion as 
business expenses 
the couple head a 5 billion hotel and realestate empire 
just as no man by position of wealth stands above the law 
walker said so too will no man who is unfit to stand trial be 
subjected to a trial simply because the publics interest in his 
case is great or simply because some people may erroneously 
conclude that the system enables a wealthy man to avoid the 
consequences of his conduct 
helmsley declined to comment after the ruling and was ushered by 
aides from the courthouse to a limousine his wife did not attend 
the hearing 
jury selection for the trial of mrs helmsley and two former 
aides begins june 26

the chinese government says that 300 soldiers 
thugs bystanders and students have been killed during the 
martial law occupation of beijing 
but most other estimates of casualties are far higher 
state council spokesman yuan mu said on tuesday that 7000 
people including 5000 soldiers have been injured and 400 other 
soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded 
nonofficial sources say yuans figures on civilian casualties 
are far too low but most have different estimates on the number of 
victims they range from 500 to 12000 people slain 
in washington us intelligence reports indicate 3000 people 
probably were killed according to a us official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity he said estimates of the number of dead 
could go higher 
nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred saturday night and 
early sunday when troops firing randomly into large crowds smashed 
through barricades to reach tiananmen square and attack 
demonstrators demanding democratic reforms 
one doctor said sunday that a quick check of 10 hospitals placed 
the death toll at 500 
other sources compiling various reports and surveys estimated 
more than 1000 people had been killed 
that number has increased with additional details and rumors of 
killings 
some officials of chinas red cross said 2600 people were killed 
but beijings red cross office has refused to provide any figures 
one hong kong newspaper reported 5000 deaths and 30000 injured 
an eastern european diplomat whose country has good relations 
with china insisted that 12000 people were slain by soldiers as 
they attacked protesters in tiananmen square 
that figure is certainly high probably fewer than 10000 people 
were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to 
escape unharmed 
but students who had joined the tiananmen occupation said 
hundreds of colleagues from the academy of fine arts who were 
huddled around their goddess of democracy statue in the square 
were shot or crushed by tanks beijing university students said 150 
of their fellow students who were in the square are missing 
there were rumors that after the square was cleared troops burned 
many corpses in large bonfires and other bodies were removed by 
helicopters and garbage trucks to minimize the death count 
yuans statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured 
were students 
the exact number of people killed may never be known 
victims were taken to dozens of hospitals clinics and homes and 
there is no indication the government will reveal many details of 
the tragedy 
and the death toll mounts troops manning checkpoints in central 
beijing continue to fire on unfriendly crowds and victims fall

israel was hacked to death with a hatchet and hanged naked by chains 
from a utility pole in the occupied west bank today arab news 
reports said 
masked youths also seriously injured a palestinian woman and her 
teenage daughter who were accused of aiding the israelis beating 
them with clubs and chains and stabbing them 
the army confirmed the arab man was slain in the city of nablus 
it said the victim had a criminal background and that police were 
investigating 
also today soldiers maintained a curfew for a fourth day in the 
occupied gaza strip confining more than 700000 people indoors 
the restrictions have prevented nine of an arab hospitals 12 
doctors from reaching work because the physicians lacked special 
curfew passes said jorgen rosendal director of the ahli arab 
hospital in gaza city 
palestinian doctors said a 75yearold gaza man was hospitalized 
after being struck in the head with a bullet when troops opened fire 
on stonethrowing demonstrators at the shati refugee camp

and housed at least 13 people neighbors said 
a second home in beit lahia that belonged to the family akilan 
suleiman bamilat was bulldozed bamilat also was convicted of 
antiisraeli activities the army said 
the united states and international human rights groups have 
strongly opposed israels use of home demolitions as a punitive 
measure saying it constitutes unfair collective punishment that 
often is carried out before palestinians are tried in court 
in the west bank village of beita three palestinians were wounded 
in a clash between troops and stonethrowers that broke out as 
soldiers conducted a searchandarrest raid arab reports said 
during the raid soldiers also reportedly demolished two 
illegally built homes in the village 
the israeli maariv daily meanwhile quoted us intelligence 
experts as telling israeli officials they expected an escalation in 
the palestinian uprising as well as increased efforts by 
palestinian rebels to obtain firearms 
participants in the 18monthold uprising so far have mainly used 
stones and firebombs in their attacks 
the death of the suspected collaborator ziad abu ras 30 raised 
to 509 the number of palestinians killed in the uprising which has 
also claimed the lives of 22 israelis since beginning on dec 8 
1987 
in all 48 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs on

a proposal to get heavy trucks off the street 
during rush hour has gotten the green light from major construction 
unions and businesses mayor tom bradley said 
following long negotiations city officials exempted trucks and 
other equipment required to pour concrete lay hot asphalt and erect 
structural steel from the traffic and smogcontrol plan the mayor 
announced tuesday 
in return the construction industry agreed to shift its work 
hours without premium pay to 6 am to 3 pm instead of the 
current 7 am to 4 pm to reduce truck and automobile traffic 
bradley said 
compromises such as these will ensure cleaner air and provide 
freeflowing streets and highways for all in the city of los angeles 
and southern california area bradley said 
the plan is expected to go before the city council next month 
however councilman zev yaroslavsky whose finance and revenue 
committee later in the day approved spending 250000 to help 
develop the plan said much work remains 
there are a lot of flaws to any program which deals with city 
streets and doesnt deal with freeways he said and i dont 
think you can deal with one city and not deal with surrounding 
cities 
the plans onehour shift would remove about 125000 construction 
workers from city streets during the morning and afternoon 
rushhour the mayor said 
the altered work schedule involves 83 union locals including 
boiler makers brick layers carpenters operating engineers 
teamsters general contractors pipe trade workers and painters 
the proposal developed by the city with a regional air quality 
control agency would require truck operators to pay a surcharge to 
use city streets during rush hour

roman catholic leaders facing a shortage of priests 
have moved into the video age with a 30second commercial that asks 
young bostonians to abandon societys selfindulgent values for the 
religious life 
if st paul were alive today he would be on madison avenue 
cardinal bernard law joked on tuesday in unveiling the tv spot 
we have in our seminary some very successful yuppies said 
law whose 2 millionmember archdiocese is the nations 
thirdlargest they were in that scene but felt it wasnt 
responding to the deepest feelings in their heart 
the church hopes stations will run the ad for free as a public 
service announcement it was developed for free by an ad executive 
the attitude in the last 10 years has been you can have it all 
and you dont have to feel guilty about anything said michael 
fortuna who put his agency to work on the campaign after reading 
about the shortage of priests 
law said his archdiocese is short about 28 assistant pastors 
the ad isnt much more than a blur of decadent visions expensive 
jewelry fast cars caviar and champagne but at the end the screen 
goes black and a pair of hands emerge holding the eucharist 
a world that doesnt deny itself anything could use a few men 
that do says an onscreen message followed by a telephone number 
the rev frank silver who worked with fortuna said the church 
has to take a more progressive approach if its to compete with 
things of the flesh 
priests dont get hit by a bolt of lightning they go through a 
natural process he said and we have to recognize the impact 
the media has on people today its how we communicate 
the rev gregory sakowicz of niles college a chicago seminary 
said he has used billboards to advertise the priesthood in his 
diocese he said a flashier approach to promoting the priesthood 
wasnt necessarily less sincere 
i certainly believe the priesthood is a call from god he 
said a billboard or television ad isnt going to create a 
vocation but its planting a seed 
however sakowicz said the ads have not been real successful in 
terms of actually getting men to the front door 
the rev john west tried to plant similar seeds in the detroit 
archdiocese in 1987 when he launched a campaign that included radio 
spots and ads in sports illustrated and people magazine

a man who has passed himself off as an 
astronaut senator pro athlete and gynecologist says hes going 
straight hes entering politics 
robert j hunt 27 is collecting signatures to run as himself 
against mayor george colella he said he made up his mind during a 
threemonth stint in jail 
i will be the next mayor of revere i have no doubt the man 
of many disguises said tuesday i am honest i think the people 
are saying that if this guy can do what he did maybe he can do 
something for this community 
in his heyday hunts favorite guise was that of an astronaut 
wearing a uniform and aviation wings ordered from nasa hunt 
lectured on aviation to pilots went to the marine corps ball and 
drank tea with the lord mayor of dublin 
people like me said hunt who trained as a plumber i know 
how to talk to people ill make a great politician 
hunt shows little remorse about his past 
i went to the white house i was made citizens of countries i 
was an impersonator and theres no law against that said hunt 
i had fun im a thrill seeker 
according to information that surfaced after his arrest in 
february on charges of swindling a couple out of 4000 hunt also 
masqueraded as a fighter pilot building contractor baseball player 
and marine captain 
earlier this year he was ordered to pay restitution to the 
couple and placed on a years probation he was also convicted of 
credit card fraud and put in jail 
hunt said his impersonations led to friendships with such 
vice president george bush and atlantis shuttle pilot rick hauck 
during his years of posing as others hunt said he was never 
tripped up by anyone he said he reads voraciously on subjects like 
aviation and nuclear war and picked up other knowledge from my 
friends in high places 
the only time hunt recalls faltering was during a lecture to 
pilots when someone asked the climb rate of a f18 fighter and 
he was off by 2000 feet 
they just thought i was tired he said

troops in the soviet republic of uzbekistan have 
not been able to halt bloody ethnic riots that have left 67 people 
dead and prompted thousands to flee officials and a newspaper 
reported today 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the congress of peoples 
deputies the situation was under control but not stable and said 
there were still incidents of arson and killing 
it has not changed for the better gorbachev said it 
concerns us very much 
the congress joined him in appealing to ethnic uzbeks and meshki 
turks to halt the bloodshed 
interior minister vadim bakatin in an interview published today 
in the communist youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said it is 
now difficult to maintain stability in areas where uzbeks and meshki 
turks live together 
he told the newspaper 11000 of the 15000 ethnic turks living 
among the 2 million uzbeks in the fergana region of central asia 
have been evacuated to temporary refugee camps 
the unrest which broke out on may 23 has mainly involved uzbeks 
and the turkish minority 
the newspaper said 67 people have died and 417 homes were burned 
in the rioting most who lost their homes were ethnic turks it said 
it also said 87 soldiers have been injured 
the communist party daily pravda said 9000 interior ministry 
soldiers were trying to maintain order in the fergana valley a 
cotton and grapegrowing region of eastern uzbekistan near 
afghanistan 
soviet dictator josef stalin exiled about 300000 ethnic turks to 
uzebekistan in the 1940s the turkish minority who are moslems 
have pressed recently to return to their homeland in soviet georgia 
near the turkish border 
the violence is the latest ethnic dispute in the southern soviet 
union where unrest in the caucasus area and central asia has killed 
scores of people and left thousands homeless 
nishanov said the violence in uzbekistan began with a dispute 
over the price of strawberries in a market 
uzbeki sources said it started between an ethnic turk and a 
tadzhik and kirghizian two other local ethnic groups but uzbekis 
resentful of the turks joined the fray 
the youth newspaper said soldiers trying to end the violence had 
honestly fulfilled their duty 
there was national outcry after soldiers in soviet georgia used 
chemicals shovels and clubs to break up a proindependence protest 
on april 9 nineteen civilians were killed and one was shot by 
soldiers for violating a curfew 
bakatin said arson robbery and looting attempts persisted in 
uzbekistan despite the heavy military and police presence he said 
315 people were arrested for violating curfew 
soldiers guarded streets squares government buildings and fire 
stations the interior minister was quoted as saying 
chronic local unemployment and economic downturn has also added 
to tension in the region 
the meskhi were the principal labor force used to build an 
irrigation system in barren northcentral uzbekistan which became a 
flourishing farm district emigre sources say many were overworked 
and died

mayoral candidate rudolph w giuliani is taking 
an earlierthanplanned leave from his law firm to avert further 
attacks over its work for the panamanian government 
the former chief federal prosecutor in manhattan said through a 
spokesman tuesday that he will leave the payroll of white amp case on 
june 15 and close out his work there by june 30 giuliani had 
planned to leave later this summer 
he moved now to devote more time to campaigning and defuse 
criticism over his affiliation with the firm said spokesman charles 
perkins 
giulianis opponents have suggested the republican tainted

a firstinthenation measure that would 
have taxed residents and businesses to pay for day care citywide was 
trounced at the polls 
its a resounding victory for those family values that have 
gotten us this far said michael samson of the profamily 
coalition for better child care which opposed the measure he said 
before the election tuesday that parents who had already raised 
children without help would defeat the measure 
with all ballots counted 3671 or 22 percent voted in favor of 
the measure and 12697 or 78 percent voted against it the tax 
needed a twothirds majority to become law in this city of 165000 
on the san francisco bay 
under measure b households would have paid an additional 12 
annually and businesses a 20 percent tax surcharge to raise 1 
million annually an additional 800000 would have come from 
general funds and developer fees 
the money was slated to buy 30 portable daycare classrooms 
provide childcare vouchers for poor families and train childcare 
providers 
while other cities subsidize child care for the poor fremont 
attempted to tax citizens directly to pay for child care for the 
entire community 
the proposal drew support from working parents feminists and 
business leaders 
paul miller of the promeasure b citizens for quality child care 
said he may return with another version children dont go away 
he said people are going to have to recognize and deal with it 
one way or another 
supporters of the measure maintained that children are the 
responsibility of the entire community and thats precisely the 
point of disagreement samson said were frightened by that 
point children are the responsibility of their parents except where 
financial assistance is a necessity 
despite the lopsided defeat just getting the measure on the 
ballot is an accomplishment and a signal the public recognizes child 
care is a pervasive problem for all classes said state 
assemblyman tom bates cochairman of a task force on the changing 
family

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the june 6 
los angeles times on chinas response to student protests 
in the end the old men who cling to power in china could think 
of no better way to deal with six weeks of popular clamor for change 
than by ordering the army to turn its machine guns and tanks against 
the protesters 
the ensuing slaughter in the streets of beijing has appalled the 
world and quite probably severed the final cords of respect linking 
chinas ruled with their rulers it was a response of a kind 
that invites open rebellion 
at no point during the demonstrations did the protesters ever 
attack the unique authority claimed and exercised by the communist 
party instead there were calls for a freer press for curbs on 
rampant official corruption and nepotism for the regime to pay more 
attention to what the students and the masses want 
the regime has claimed from the beginning and claims now that 
only a handful of troublemakers were involved in the calls for a 
freer society that attempt to minimize the depth of the protests 
fools no politically aware person in china 
what has taken place what still goes on is a mass protest 
triggered by frustration and anger over economic and political 
conditions the costs of this morally odious action to chinas 
stability to its international standing to its prospects for 
future development are certain to prove enormous

dallas times herald on democratization moves in communist 
countries 
the images from the communist world have been stunning poland 
has just held elections hungary and czechoslovakia are discussing 
democratization and popular nationalist movements have arisen in 
the western region of the soviet union 
china has been all but paralyzed as its citizens demand 
democratization under the gaze of a statue of liberty erected 
opposite the stern gaze of chairman mao 
in the soviet union more than 200 million people have watched 
telecasts of elected delegates to the congress of peoples deputies 
denouncing the party the president stalin and the kgb 
throughout the third world young nations that had embraced the 
egalitarian nature of communist doctrine have reversed themselves 
and appealed to the international monetary fund for economic 
guidance 
the west has no active roll to play in the drama engulfing these 
nations but ronald reagan in his second term and president bush of 
late have correctly noted that an economic hand extended during 
periods of liberalization in communist countries pays dividends to 
all 
in the future economic relations with the communist bloc should 
be geared to the degree of which these nations reform themselves and 
encourage privatemarket initiatives 
that wont prompt the east to embrace capitalism but it will 
stimulate the transition from a political system economically 
bankrupt at its inception to a new economic and political order 
befitting a world about to move into the 21st century

albuquerque nm journal on the death of khomeini 
the malevolent ayatollah is dead but that doesnt mean iran will 
soon rejoin the community of nations or that 15 hostages including 
nine americans being held in irans name will soon be freed 
the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on saturday at age 86 
seems certain to trigger a power struggle among religious mullahs 
whose disagreements he often arbitrated the regime of president ali 
khamenei whose term expires in october is considered to be only an 
interim caretaker government 
time will tell if the death of khomeini will loosen the 
revolutions draconian grip on iranian society or if the 
revolution will long survive his charismatic authoritarian 
leadership 
an era ended in iran with khomeinis passing the united states 
can only hope that moderates will somehow gain a significant voice 
in whatever government follows khomeinis awful regime

the saginaw mich news on the death of khomeini 
iran mourns but he lived too long the ayatollah khomeini 
whatever homage iranians pay him elsewhere he was a throwback to 
the dark ages of a faith blind to humanity full of vengeance absent 
of the mercy of civilization 
khomeini did not keep his counsel within his own land but sought 
to spread abroad his malevolent brand of fundamentalism archaic and 
alien even to most moslems 
if he was a holy man he was a bitter one with malice toward 
nearly all charity toward virtually none 
nor does it seem likely that iran will soon veer from his course 
for the hostages for mideast peace his death offers some slight 
chance 
but those of good will should not count on reciprocation 
khomeini was a modern aberration but modern times teach that the 
gleam of evil finds all too many reflections

historians will probably try to interpret the resignation of jim

is that even the most respected best liked can fall from grace 
when the nations business gets mixed up with his personal business 
and from the 69 documented charges against him wrights personal 
business wasnt ethical by any standard 
he is entitled to stay in congress at least for as long as his 
constituents back in texas want him there

postbulletin rochester minn on bushsoviets 
president bush has responded effectively to recent policy 
initiatives by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the president acted decisively in his visit to west germany 
particularly with his statement on arms reduction and his call for 
the east bloc to tear down the berlin wall and to bury the cold 
war 
bushs more assertive approach not only scored points in the 
public relations war with the soviet union it also was 
wellreceived in this country where public opinion has tended to 
believe that gorbachevs reforms and less bellicose attitude are 
genuine and hopeful signs 
there is no assurance that reforms now under way in the soviet 
union the east bloc countries or in china will succeed repression 
may return 
but whatever happens the people in communistdominated countries 
never again will be as docile or submissive as they have been for 
the past 70 years in the ussr and the past 40 years in china 
bush is right in encouraging these reforms he is right in 
challenging soviet leaders to reduce armaments to a level that makes 
sense for defense but drastically reduces offensive capability

heralddispatch huntington wva on the berlin wall 
president kennedy was the first to issue the call that was in 
1963 
president carter repeated the message in 1978 and president 
reagan in 1987 now president bush as he should has added his 
voice 
speaking in west germany bush called on the soviet union to tear 
down the berlin wall the wall stands as a monument to the failure 
of communism it must come down make all berlin a center of 
commerce between east and west a place of cooperation not 
confrontation 
bush thus has managed to put a bit of political pressure on 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who visits west germany in midjune 
europeans in general and the west germans in particualr have 
welcomed the apparent conciliation and cooperation that have been 
gorbachevs hallmark since he took power in moscow but the blunt 
reality is that glasnost will be little more than a pretty word 
as long as the berlin wall stands 
the soviets should back up their words with deeds and start by 
dismantling the berlin wall

the government said today that savings and loan 
customers withdrew 54 billion from their accounts in april a high 
number but an improvement compared with the record outflows earlier 
in the year 
it was the 12th consecutive month of withdrawals and the sixth in 
a row when outflows exceeded 5 billion according to a report by 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 2934 
sampls 
in the first four months of the year customers withdrew 337 
billion more than they deposited compared with a 162 billion gain 
in deposits during the same period of last year 
withdrawals set a onemonth record of 108 billion in january 
slipping to 92 billion in february and 83 billion in march 
james barth chief economist of the bank board said the april 
figure is better than it at first appears 
about half of the outflow is accounted for by 10 thrifts four 
of which are insolvent he said in a statement the deposit 
outflow figures are even smaller when you account for seasonal 
factors since one of the poorest deposit flow months of the year is 
april when people are paying income taxes 
on a seasonally adjusted basis the outflow was 16 billion 
down sharply from 67 billion in march and the smallest outflow 
since last september 
barth attributed the continuing withdrawals to the failure of 
sampls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors 
such as mutual funds and to orders from regulators requiring 
overextended thrift institutions to shrink 
private analysts say lack of public confidence in sampls is also a 
factor to remedy that the bush administration has urged congress 
to move more swiftly on its bailout plan now not expected to reach 
the presidents desk until next month

president mikhail s gorbachev rejected an attempt 
by lawmakers today to name maverick communist leader boris yeltsin 
as head of a government watchdog agency 
gorbachev proposed gennady kolbin party chief of the central 
asian republic of kazakhstan to head the peoples control 
committee which oversees government planning and spending but a 
parade of supreme soviet deputies took the floor to promote yeltsin 
for the job 
they praised yeltsins reputation for independence and battling 
corruption which they said made him better suited for the post 
gorbachev however insisted it was his constitutional right to name 
his own choice subject only to the legislatures consent 
after permitting more than an hour of debate during which 
deputies spoke on behalf of either yeltsin or kolbin the president 
moved to cut off further discussion and forced a vote that resulted 
in overwhelming confirmation of kolbin 
yeltsin himself took the floor near the end to say he thought 
kolbin was qualified for the post but he did not withdraw himself 
from the running 
only nine of the 509 deputies participating voted to reject 
kolbin 34 deputies abstained under the confirmation procedure 
yeltsins name was not submitted for a vote 
earlier in the day premier nikolai i ryzhkov was bombarded with 
lawmakers complaints about the soviet unions economic and 
environmental ills then won nearunanimous approval to remain at 
the helm of the countrys vast bureaucracy 
the new supreme soviet legislature elected from the membership 
of the congress of peoples deputies confirmed ryzhkov with 500 of 
the 509 deputies voting for the 59yearold technocrat 
ryzhkov a former factory director has been premier since 
september 1985 overseeing efforts to implement gorbachevs economic 
and political reforms 
already tapped for the post by gorbachev and endorsed by the 
communist party he had been expected to win confirmation by the new 
legislature 
gorbachev praised ryzhkov as a determined proponent of the 
policy of perestroika and defended his record as the countrys 
economic chief 
but other legislators grilled him about poverty poor 
agricultural performance a shortage of consumer goods and the 
ecological crises in many soviet cities 
yuri komarov a deputy from siberia commented that gosagroprom 
an agricultural superministry created at the start of gorbachevs 
reforms and abolished last march was so inefficient that people 
were saying it was the most successful action by the cia against the 
soviet economy 
a lithuanian deputy demanded to know what the government plans to 
do about 43 million soviets he said are living below the poverty 
line calling their position disastrous ryzhkov agreed that 
something must be done but did not specify what 
deputy anatoly miloserdny of byelorussia blamed the council of 
ministers that ryzhkov heads for shortsightedness saying it had 
led to a shortage of the most basic consumer goods 
ryzhkov denied that the council had made strategic errors in 
implementing reforms but admitted to some specific mistakes that 
had a negative effect on the economy 
for example he said attempts to make state enterprises more 
independent led to an unbalancing of the consumer market

two cubanborn republicans today entered the race 
for the congressional seat left vacant by the death of claude 
pepper the liberal democrat whose district came to be dominated by 
conservative hispanics 
state sen ileana roslehtinen and conservative businessman 
carlos perez announced bids to become the first cubanamerican in 
congress the miami herald reported today that democratic state sen 
jack gordon also will run 
the special election will be held aug 29 
roslehtinen pledged to continue the districts tradition of a 
leadership which has been based on a caring conscience and 
conservative convictions claude peppers passing has left a void 
that is nearly impossible to fill 
she said her priorities are bridging the ethnic and social 
differences in the district protecting social security waging war 
on drugs taking a tough stand on cuba and nicaragua and strongly 
supporting israel 
gov bob martinez called the special election on tuesday a day 
after the 88yearold congressman was buried in tallahassee after a 
week of mourning 
claude pepper will be difficult if not impossible to replace 
in congress but its vitally important that we move as quickly as 
possible so that the people of floridas 18th congressional district 
can be represented martinez said 
primaries were set for aug 1 with runoffs if needed on aug 
15 
pepper was elected to the seat after its creation in 1962 and won 
reelection by large margins every two years he drew no opposition 
last year 
in his absence republicans are hoping to control the district 
whose registration is 54 percent democrat down from 72 percent a 
decade ago hispanics are estimated to comprise nearly half the 
district 
i think the chances are pretty good for a cubanamerican to be 
elected said sergio bendixen a democratic strategist without 
a doubt that person would be the most powerful cubanamerican in 
the country 
the miami area is home for many of the 1 million cubans who have 
come to the united states since fidel castros revolution 30 years 
ago 
miami mayor xavier suarez an independent elected in 1985 as the 
citys first cubanborn mayor has indicated he will support 
roslehtinen 
roslehtinen a 36yearold educator is married to popular us 
attorney dexter lehtinen who has said he is happy in his current 
highprofile position 
perez a millionaire banana importer is a staunch supporter of 
former president reagan and oliver north 
republican state rep al gutman whose cubanjewish heritage fits 
two large ethnic groups in the district also was mulling over a 
candidacy 
on the democratic side state sen jack gordon said he would 
decide by friday whether to run gordon 67 shares much of peppers 
constituency and liberalism but may have problems with hispanic 
voters because of his opposition to nicaraguan contra aid 
hialeah mayor raul martinez also cubanborn was a possible 
democratic contender as were commissioner rosario kennedy miami 
beach mayor alex daoud dade county commissioner joe gersten state 
attorney janet reno and former school board chairman paul cejas

the census bureau launched an effort wednesday 
to get local government officials involved in making sure everyone 
is counted in 1990 
the agency said it is sending technical guides to 39000 local 
governments encouraging them to review census maps to make sure all 
housing units are included 
more than 100 million census forms will be sent to american 
households at the end of march 1990 to be used in completing the 
national head count april 1 
the bureau said it will hold 470 training sessions for local 
officials across the nation 
then later this summer census maps will be sent to the local 
governments for comparison with local tax records occupancy and 
demolition permits utility hookups and other records to make sure 
no home has been overlooked 
once that is completed the census bureau will compile 
blockbyblock housing counts and send them back to local officials 
in november for yet another check prior to the actual census 
census counts are vital to city state and other local 
governments because those numbers are used to determine 
representation in congress and in the distribution of billions of 
dollars in state and federal funds to communities

between 12 and 22 percent of americas children 
as many as 14 million of those under age 18 are suffering from 
some type of mental disorder but only about a third are receiving 
any treatment a study released today reported 
a committee of the institute of medicine said in the study that 
though millions of childhood mental disorders are not treated the 
situation has improved in the last 20 years and there is 
demonstrable progress toward understanding preventing and 
correcting many of the mental diseases of youngsters 
there is increasing reason for optimism that many of the major 
childhood mental disorders are responsive to treatment the 
committee said 
but in far too many cases no treatment at all is being offered 
to troubled youngsters the committee said 
at a news conference today committee chairman james f leckman 
of yale university said that of the mentally ill children a third 
or less are treated often because their problems go undetected or 
because resources for care are not available 
we have a long way to go said leckman this group has been 
underserved by society there is a stigma associated with mental 
illness that is a clear and persistent problem in our society 
americans respond to physical disorders much more readily than to 
mental health problems said dr fredric solomon director of the 
mental health division of the institute of medicine 
eighty percent of the phyically disabled children are served 
he said for mental disorders less than 20 percent of the 
children are served even if they are noticed 
solomon said that studies have shown that even medical 
professionals such as pediatricians generally recognize only about 
about quarter of their patients who are suffering from mental 
disorders he said often the children who receive attention by 
society are only those with disruptive behavior 
members of the committee said it is difficult to obtain reliable 
data to precisely define how many of the childhood population are 
suffering from mental problems but leckman said there are 
indications that the likelihood is that the rate is increasing 
dr glen r elliott vice chairman of the committee and a 
professor of psychiatry at the university of california san 
francisco said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood 
suicides and in eating disorders 
though conservative estimates place the number of american 
children with mental disorders at about 75 million or 12 percent 
the committee said the number could be much higher 
recent studies have suggested that the ange may be as high as 
17 to 22 percent or 11 to 14 million children and adolescents 
the report said 
problems identified in the report included mood disorders such as 
depression behavior disorders such as hyperactivity developmental 
disorders such as autism as well as chronic drug use sexual 
problems and eating disorders including anorexia 
approximately 25 million children in this country received 
treatment in 1985 for a mental disorder the committee reported 
this means that at least another 5 million other children needed 
some type of intervention but did not receive any treatment 
poverty and ghetto life contribute heavily to the nations 
troubled youth the study said 
youngsters with mental and behavioral problems may exceed 20 
percent in some populations such as innercity children who are 
exposed to severe psychological adversity the study said 
the total cost to the nation has not been measured but the 
committee said the figure would probably run into the billions of 
dollars a year 
in addition to the costs of treatment the committee said there 
are substantial indirect costs from the need for social services 
criminal justice and special education 
each year in this nation about 49000 children and youth are 
held in various public youth facilities and many thousands more are 
in adult prisons the study said millions of children are 
involved with child welfare foster care and residential treatment 
many of these children have a diagnosable mental disorder but 
receive neither diagnosis nor treatment 
the study also said that about 25 percent of all mentally 
retarded children also have behavioral and emotional difficulties 
these compound problems often result in such children being confined 
for life to institutions 
a national plan of coordinated research and training that would 
attract more professionals to the mental health field and lead to a 
better understanding of how to prevent evaluate and treat mental 
illness in children was proposed by the committee the report called 
for a national investment of up to 198 million annually by the 
fifth year 
the institute of medicine is part of the national academy of 
sciences a private organization chartered by congress as an adviser 
to the federal government in scientific and technical matters

the federal reserve board on wednesday opposed 
legislation to make it disclose numerical ratings on how well banks 
and other financial institutions lend money for community needs 
particularly lowincome housing small business and small farm loans 
martha r seger one of the feds seven governors said the 
community reinvestment act cra ratings if released publicly 
could be misunderstood as a reflection of financial soundness 
and undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in an 
institution 
under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of deposits 
back into lending for local needs the fed and other regulators now 
rate banks savings and loan associations and other deposit 
institutions on a 1to5 besttoworst scale 
like commerical examination ratings the cra numbers have been 
treated by regulators as confidential although on occasion they 
have been used to challenge and deny a banks application to expand 
testifying before the senate banking committees subcommittee on 
consumer affairs ms seger said the ratings were designed as a 
supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutions 
needing closer attention 
the number rating is in no way a selfexplanatory indicator of 
performance and can be misleading she said 
nonetheless she said the fed could support amending the 1977 
law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each banks 
community reinvestment performance based on regulators examinations 
the subcommittee is considering a series of bills by sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio that would require publishing of the numerical 
ratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cash 
government checks of nondepositors and provide lowcost checking 
accounts to the poor and elderly 
civil rights and community activist groups have called for the 
increased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two years 
of redlining by financial insitutions in atlanta new york and 
detroit 
redlining is practice by which banks and sampls have used zip codes 
and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to 
residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of 
minorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness 
many lenders still dont accept an obligation to reinvest 
innercity deposits in sound innercity loans said gale cincotta 
executive director of the national training and information center 
a chicagobased group that helps local organizations pressure banks 
for cra lending 
cincotta said the entire rating system lacks credibility because 
the fed and other regulators already give 1 and 2 excellent or 
good ratings to 95 percent of the institutions 
disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to this 
credibility gap and make it that much more likely that regulators 
would actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system 
cincotta said 
trade association lobbyists have opposed metzenbaums bill 
citing the arguments raised by both ms seger and cincotta as well 
as a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exert 
pressure for granting unsound loans 
metzenbaum tried to add the measures to president bushs sampl 
bailout bill when it was considered by the senate in april but 
withdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition 
the banking subcommittees chairman sen alan dixon dill 
endorsed elements of metzenbaums proposal wednesday but said he 
also was sympathetic to the arguments made by ms seger against 
disclosing the numerical ratings

authorities are examining the 
policies of the farright republican party to determine whether they 
violate constitutional bans against extremist groups officials said 
wednesday 
the party might be banned if its policies are found to be 
contrary to the countrys charter said bavarian interior minister 
edmund stoiber 
he said the partys election rallies have been marked by 
incredible intolerance and brutality 
the republicans led by former nazi ss soldier franz schoenhuber 
are campaigning for the ouster of foreign workers from west germany 
and for limits on the number of people granted asylum in the country 
stoiber made the announcement 10 days before a vote for the 
european parliament the republicans headquarters are in munich 
the bavarian capital 
although it is running for seats in the european parliament the 
party rejects most european economic community policies the 
parliament based in strasbourg france consists of elected members 
from each eec nation 
the partys views have been described by critics as similar to 
those of neonazis and stoiber said four of the republicans 20 
candidates for the european parliament have an extremist rightist 
background 
as an example of the partys growing extremism stoiber quoted a 
recent statement by its leader schoenhuber who reportedly said 
if hitler was more aware of history he would not have let himself 
be dragged into war only six years after gaining power 
a regional republican leader in bavaria recently caused an uproar 
by suggesting that the partys leftist opponents be sent to labor 
camps 
the republicans scored major gains in recent state and municipal 
elections winning 11 seats in west berlins senate and seats in 
several local legislatures in hesse state 
recent polls have predicted the party might get more than 5 
percent in the national elections in december 1990 permitting it to 
enter west germanys federal parliament for the first time 
official federal interior ministry documents until now have 
described the republicans as a radical rather than an 
extremist party as such the republicans did not fall under 
automatic observation by the countrys top internal security agency 
the verfassungsschutz 
groups judged extremist whether rightist or leftist are 
routinely watched by the agency stoiber said authorities will 
determine whether the republicans might be qualified as 
extremist if so and their policies are contrary to the 
constitution they might be banned stoiber said

new house speaker tom foley predicted today 
that attack dogs will be curbed and wounds opened by the 
resignation of jim wright will heal but his prediction was tested 
by harsh republican attacks aimed at him and the democratic party 
we should dispute about things of principle things of policy 
that we disagree about foley said but we ought to be able to 
do that without turning to personal attacks or recrimination 
i think the attack dogs are going to be curbed by the 
republicans and the democrats the washington democrat said on nbcs 
today show 
he later told reporters that republican national committee 
chairman lee atwater already had apologized for a document prepared 
by a committee aide that attacked him as a closet liberal and 
likened his voting record to that of rep barney frank dmass an 
acknowledged homosexual 
mark goodin rnc communications director and author of the 
document resigned at midday he said he regretted preparing the 
document but contended he never intended to damage anyones 
reputation 
foleys concilatory comments today continued a theme he pressed 
on the house upon taking the speakers gavel tuesday 
we cannot tolerate the continuance of the current distrust and 
suspicion and expect to fulfill the publics expectation he said 
foleys words were meant to sooth a house shaken by an 
extraordinary upheaval in the democratic ranks with two of the 
three top party officers exiting because of questions about their 
personal finances 
wright dtexas resigned after the house ethics committee 
charged him with violating house rules on outside income and the 
no 3 democrat majority whip tony coelho of california is stepping 
down to avoid inquiry into a junk bond deal 
the democrats plan to meet next week to fill foleys old post of 
majority leader and the whips job 
republicans have moved quickly to take advantage of the 
democratic turmoil attacking foley and telling democrats they cant 
run away from the ethics issue 
house minority leader bob michel rill turned the usually 
goodwilled gesture of introducing the new speaker to the house into 
a strongly worded reminder that republicans are seething after 35 
years under the ruling democrats 
thirtyfive years of uninterrupted power can act like a 
corrosive acid upon the restraints of civility and comity he 
said i am all in favor of putting our house in order but we 
dont do so by sweeping things under the rug 
earlier tuesday speaking to a republican conference michel 
said the house has been corrupted by the absolute power of 
oneparty domination and it isnt going to be cured by a personality 
transplant 
many democrats considered michels remarks a slap at the olive 
branch foley was extending 
i think they could have been a little more conciliatory a 
little more healing said rep dale kildee dmich 
a more personal shot at foley from the republican national 
committee was brushed aside by the new speaker and he said today 
that atwater had called him to apologize 
the rnc issued a paper comparing foleys voting record to that of 
frank the paper was headlined tom foley out of the liberal 
closet 
frank took ire calling the document despicable and said he 
might expose gay republican lawmakers if the gop continues making 
scurrilous attacks 
he noted that republicans have not been immune from ethics 
problems citing the may 26 conviction of rep donald lukens 
rohio on charges of having sex with a 16yearold girl 
foley himself said he hadnt read the republican paper and didnt 
intend to im not concerned about political action committees i 
want to work with the president work with the leadership of the 
congress he said 
foley also promised to meet michels demand for swift action on 
an ethics and campaign reform package a goal democrats also want 
to meet in order to put the whole ethics issue to rest 
reps vic fazio dcalif and lynn martin rill the 
cochairmen of an alreadyoperating task force on ethics issued a 
joint statement welcoming foleys support 
foley also promised to renew the tradition of regular meetings of 
the house democratic and gop leadership something wright abandoned 
more than a year ago foley intended to join michel today for lunch 
with president bush at the white house 
if theres anybody who has the ability to get us back on track 
and away from the tenseness its tom foley said rep mike synar 
dokla 
foley was keeping at arms length from the scramble to fill 
vacancies in the other house leadership slots 
rep richard gephardt dmo is considered the leading candidate 
to fill foleys old post of majority leader foley campaigned for 
gephardt last year when gephardt was seeking the democratic 
presidential nomination 
rep ed jenkins dga is challenging gephardt for the leaders 
job jenkins is from the conservative wing of the party and like 
gephardt is a member of the ways and means committee 
the race for majority whip narrowed to three candidates on 
tuesday when rep henry waxman of california decided against a 
campaign of his own and threw his support to rep william h gray 
iii 
gray dpa is the chairman of the house democratic caucus hes 
facing two other prominent democrats david bonior of michigan the 
chief deputy whip and beryl anthony of arkansas the chairman of 
the democratic congressional campaign committee

they can be returned for a refund the commission said the boats 
can be identified by the name primexshyf 4768 
the second recall involves baby strollers sold by mccrory stores 
inc which has its headquarters in york pa

in addition to the recalls the commission issued a warning about 
a crib toy called crib kickers made by red calliope of los angeles 
these toys consist of a series of polyesterfilled figures such 
as animals and flowers attached to a ribbon for tying them across 
the top of a crib or playpen 
such toys can pose a danger of strangling to children once the 
infant is old enough to push itself up and possibly get caught in 
the ribbon 
a warning is supposed to accompany such toys urging parents to 
remove them when children reach that stage of development the 
commission said a warning was included in the box of the crib 
kicker but was not attached to the toy so it issued a public 
reminder of the danger

time inc shares rocketed in early trading today 
in a runup sparked by a 107 billion takeover offer from paramount 
communications inc the offer rivals a merger agreement time has 
with warner communications inc 
time jumped 4350 to 16950 a share on the new york stock 
exchange after a delayed opening warner was up 137 to 5312 
and paramount slipped 87 cents to 5312 
paramount the entertainment and media company formerly known as 
gulf amp western inc announced late tuesday a tender offer of 175 a 
share cash for time 
the company also filed a lawsuit in delaware where time is 
incorporated to block provisions of the timewarner agreement that 
paramount said were aimed at thwarting competing offers but a judge 
declined to immediately grant paramounts request 
the paramount offer comes 2 weeks before time shareholders are 
to vote on whether to approve the merger with warner a stock swap 
combination that would create the worlds biggest media and 
entertainment company with 10 billion in annual revenue 
harold vogel who follows the entertainment industry for merrill 
lynch amp co said the paramount bid would provoke a much lengthier 
battle than time and warner had anticipated 
paramounts bid is 60 percent above where time stock was trading 
before the publishing and cable giant announced in march it had 
reached an agreement with warner 
its also 39 percent above times closing price tuesday of 126 a 
share up 275 from mondays close 
paramount is the owner of paramount pictures whose films include 
the crocodile dundee beverly hills cop and indiana 
jones series its tv programs include cheers and family 
ties paramount also owns publishers simon amp schuster and pocket 
books 
martin s davis paramount chairman and chief executive said a 
marriage of his company and time would create the foremost 
american communications company capable of competing on a global 
scale against foreign media giants 
thats also a goal of the timewarner merger plan warner also 
owns a movie and tv production companies 
in a statement time said its board would review the proposal 
as required by law and urged its shareholders not to do 
anything until they hear from time 
a warner spokesman said the company had no immediate comment 
davis said paramount would make a superb business fit with 
time the nations biggest publishing company 
we will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and book 
publishing as well as in motion picture and television production 
and distribution cable systems and cable programming he said 
davis said time had essentially put itself up for sale by 
agreeing to merge with warner in a deal that would wind up giving 
warners shareholders 60 percent of the new company nevertheless 
paramount said it would withdraw its offer if time shareholders 
approve the warner transaction on june 23

about 11000 people have been injured and 
many have died during three days of anguished grieving for ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini the government said wednesday 
tens of thousands turned out for memorial service on wednesday 
for khomeini with many voicing support for irans new leader 
president ali khamenei 
carrying black flags and portraits of khomeini the crowds at 
tehran university chanted obedience to khamenei is obedience to 
the imam of the islamic nation iranians called khomeini their 
imam or spiritual leader 
buses brought hundreds of people to the city center campus early 
in the morning and streets all around were packed with people 
the memorial service was attended by khamenei and other leaders 
including parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani prime minister 
hussein musavi chief justice musavi ardebili and khomeinis son 
ahmad 
cabinet ministers and ranking members of the armed forces 
leadership also were present and a special section of the prayer 
area was reserved for wounded veterans of the 8year war with iraq 
one man sitting in a wheelchair said we were ready to die or 
the imam but now he is dead we have nothing to live for 
in a renewed outpouring of grief for khomeini the worshippers 
beat their heads with their fists in the traditional shiite moslem 
mourning rite 
the imam is in heaven today and better we were dead and you 
were here with us they chanted 
around 100 people who collapsed in the fierce heat and crush of 
the densely packed crowd were hoisted over the heads of the 
worshipers and placed on stretchers for transfer to first aid 
stations 
irans official media said almost 11000 people were injured in 
three days of mourning since khomeinis death on saturday with 438 
taken to hospital 
tehran radio quoted an unidentified health service official as 
saying many died but no figures were given eight people were 
reported dead on monday 
khomeini 86 died in a tehran hospital of a heart attack 11 days 
after undergoing surgery may 23 for internal bleeding 
khamenei considered a moderate was voted his successor on 
sunday by 60 out of 74 experts who were handpicked by khomeini in 
the early days of the islamic revolution to handle the succession 
issue 
but his appointment appeared a stopgap measure to fill a 
political vacuum while constitutional reforms are prepared for 
approval in a referendum to be held aug 18 
iranians also will vote for a new president that day with 
khamenei 49 barred from running for a third fouryear term under 
the constitution 
the only candidate so far declared is rafsanjani 55 a khamenei 
ally and leader of the socalled pragmatists in the regimes 
infighting between moderate and hardliners 
but in a show of unity the leading hardliners ardebili and 
musavi joined rafsanjani and khamenei in issuing a joint statement 
wednesday pledging to work together and continue the 
revolutionary patriarchs policies 
the statement called on iranians to close ranks even further 
and watch out for probable moves and plots of the enemies of the 
revolution 
the statecontrolled newspapers echoed that theme calling for 
obedience to khamenei as the countrys new religious leader 
although he is only a middleranking clergyman khamenei has been 
accorded the courtesy title of ayatollah in recognition of his 
new status 
the constitutional reforms ordered by khomeini earlier this year 
probably will invest the president with strong executive powers in 
order to eliminate competing power centers that have slowed the 
decisionmaking process for years 
thousand of mourners poured into the capital from other iranian 
cities to pray at khomeinis grave he was buried tuesday amid 
frenzied scenes of grief in a the beheshte zahra cemetery in south 
tehran beside fighters who died in the gulf war and in the 1979 
revolution that brought him to power

the internal revenue service is seeking 
100000 in back taxes and penalties from richard w dortch 
contending his 259142 yearly salary from ptl ministries was nearly 
twice what was reasonable 
the irs also contends that dortch who was second in command to 
jim bakker at ptl made personal use of the ministries airplane and 
failed to pay tax on bonuses and housing allowances provided by ptl 
the dispute is over dortchs tax return for 1984 he challenged 
the irs assessment by filing suit in tax court 
in 1984 dortch served as copastor and executive director of 
ptls heritage village church and missionary fellowship in fort 
mill sc 
according to irs court documents ptl paid dortch 85104 during 
the 12 months that ended may 31 1984 and 322667 during the 
following 12 months the irs calculated the compensation at 259142 
for calendar year 1984 and contended that 132365 of that was 
unreasonable for a taxexempt church to have paid 
dortch disputed irs allegations that he 
should have reported as taxable income two payments totaling 
125000 from ptl into his account with the assemblies of god 
ministers pension plan 
used ptls plane for personal use almost 28 percent of the time

martha r seger one of the feds seven governors said the 
community reinvestment act cra ratings if released publicly 
could be misunderstood as a reflection of financial soundness 
and undermine public confidence in the safety of deposits in an 
institution 
under the 1977 law intended to encourage the plowing of deposits 
back into lending for local needs the fed and other regulators now 
rate banks savings and loan associations and other deposit 
institutions on a 1to5 besttoworst scale 
like commerical examination ratings the cra numbers have been 
treated by regulators as confidential although on occasion they 
have been used to challenge and deny a banks application to expand 
testifying before the senate banking committees subcommittee on 
consumer affairs ms seger said the ratings were designed as a 
supervisory shorthand to help us monitor those institutions 
needing closer attention 
the number rating is in no way a selfexplanatory indicator of 
performance and can be misleading she said 
nonetheless she said the fed could support amending the 1977 
law to require it to regularly publish evaluations of each banks 
community reinvestment performance based on regulators examinations 
the subcommittee is considering a series of bills by sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio that would require publishing of the numerical 
ratings and also make banks and other financial institutions cash 
government checks of nondepositors and provide lowcost checking 
accounts to the poor and elderly 
civil rights and community activist groups have called for the 
increased disclosures in the wake of reports over the past two years 
of redlining by financial insitutions in atlanta new york and 
detroit 
redlining is practice by which banks and sampls have used zip codes 
and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to 
residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of 
minorities or poor people regardless of their credit worthiness 
many lenders still dont accept an obligation to reinvest 
innercity deposits in sound innercity loans said gale cincotta 
executive director of the national training and information center 
a chicagobased group that helps local organizations pressure banks 
for cra lending 
cincotta said the entire rating system lacks credibility because 
the fed and other regulators already give 1 and 2 excellent or 
good ratings to 95 percent of the institutions 
disclosing individual ratings of lenders would add to this 
credibility gap and make it that much more likely that regulators 
would actually develop a meaningful and credible ratings system 
cincotta said 
trade association lobbyists have opposed metzenbaums bill 
citing the arguments raised by both ms seger and cincotta as well 
as a claim that community activists would use the ratings to exert 
pressure for granting unsound loans 
metzenbaum tried to add the measures to president bushs sampl 
bailout bill when it was considered by the senate in april but 
withdrew them in the face of overwhelming opposition 
the banking subcommittees chairman sen alan dixon dill 
endorsed elements of metzenbaums proposal wednesday but said he 
also was sympathetic to the arguments made by ms seger against 
disclosing the numerical ratings

a house subcommittee voted wednesday to 
subpoena a reagan administration housing official who has refused to 
help in an investigation of alleged contracting irregularities in 
the department of housing and urban development 
the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing voted unanimously to subpoena deborah dean who was 
executive assistant to thenhud secretary samuel pierce in 198287 
the position of assistant secretary of housing turned over 
frequently during the pierce years but ms dean was there through 
most of his term said celia boddington staff member for the 
subcommittee headed by rep tom lantos dcalif 
the subcommittee is investigating allegations that wellconnected 
republicans were favored in a federal subsidy program for lowincome 
housing construction 
james watt who served as interior secretary under president 
reagan has agreed to testify friday about his role after leaving 
office as a consultant to a developer who got one of the subsidy 
contracts 
the developer judith siegel president of landex corp has 
testified that watt helped her get a contract for a 312unit project

before toxic chemicals from the avtex 
fibers plant seeped into the wells of homes across the shenandoah 
river william polands house was part of a neighborhood 
the neighbors are gone 
poland and his wife are the only residents left in the rivermont 
acres subdivision living alone on a dirt road that cuts through 
fields between cement blocks where other houses once stood 
at the entrance to the road a homemade sign reads entering 
water pollution area 
the polands ranch house was one of a dozen small homes with back 
yards slanting down to the river lined with trees that in 
summertime blocked the view of the 65acre rayon plant on the 
opposite bank 
avtex fibers inc bought up most of the subdivision five years 
ago when tests showed that groundwater had been contaminated by 
viscose and sulfate bases from the plants holding ponds but the 
purchases stopped short of polands house the furthest upstream 
from the plant because it is outside the contaminated zone the 
company says 
poland said many of the former residents of the subdivision have 
died of cancer and he is worried about his and his wifes health 
hed like to sell the house and move he said but most real estate 
agents wont touch the property 
im stuck and i know it he said they dont have to do 
anything about it what makes me so mad is they knowingly endangered 
the lives of everyone down here they dont do anything unless 
theyre forced to do it 
the avtex holding ponds havent been used since the contamination 
was discovered and the environmental protection agency declared the 
area a cleanup site in 1984 under the industryfinanced superfund 
law said avtex spokesman nick nichols but pollution of the 
groundwater and the river has continued state officials say 
at a hearing last week on the plants violations of state water 
pollution limits state and avtex officials alike described the 
50yearold plant as leaking chemicals through its floors and 
deteriorated sewer systems 
richmond circuit judge tj markow is considering a state 
proposal to fine avtex 140000 for violating its agreement to 
comply with state water discharge limits 
from the other side of the river few of the aging plants 
problems are visible except an occasional patch of white gleaming 
on the river bottom and a cloudy brown plume of water spewing into 
the green river further downstream 
poland 49 worked for avtex for 17 years until quitting in 1981 
he says the first sign of a problem in rivermont acres came in 1968 
when a neighbor dug a well and found a smelly green substance at the 
bottom 
the discovery led to more than a decade of official inquiries and 
tests of water in the subdivision 
meanwhile poland started bringing in his own drinking water in 
1972 when his water started tasting bad 
it smelled like sulfur he said at the same time he started 
itching and having skin problems 
the dog scratched for a week after a bath he added he 
dont imagine things 
in october 1981 the county health department advised residents 
that the well water in this area could be potentially hazardous to 
your health and you should not drink it 
wells in the area had been found to be contaminated with 
chromium arsenic cadmium carbon disulfide and phenols the 
department said 
after the area was declared a superfund site in 1984 avtex 
offered to purchase all the plots in the subdivision except polands 
mr polands property is not within the contamination area 
nichols said in july 1984 avtex did an analysis of his well that 
proved to be standard for the area 
after poland complained to the company of itching after showers 
nichols said avtex agreed to provide him with water as a matter of 
courtesy 
poland said avtex built him a 6000 gallon reservoir at a cost of 
8000 and refills it each month 
tests have showed trace amounts of various chemicals in his 
groundwater but poland says officials have told him its not 
avtexrelated 
poland says hes resigned to staying at rivermont acres and if 
the avtex plant closes as he expects it will hell go back to 
buying his own drinking water 
im just fed up with the area he said its peaceful in 
the summertime but its lonely as hell down here in the wintertime 
you dont see nobody

air force secretary donald b rice cautioned 
members of congress wednesday against increasing funds for the 
landbased midgetman missile by cutting money for other military 
programs 
its simply unnecessary there is no reason for an increase in 
1990 funds rice told the senate appropriations defense 
subcommittee he responded to questions from subcommittee chairman 
daniel inouye dhawaii about congressional opposition to spending 
levels for landbased nuclear weapons 
defense secretary dick cheney has proposed a fiscal 1990 defense 
budget that includes 12 billion for the multiplewarhead mx 
missile with the existing 50 missiles to be moved from silos to 
railroad cars by 1992 and 100 million for research and development 
of the singlewarhead midgetman 
democrats who favor the midgetman have criticized the small 
amount of money earmarked for it while republicans who support the 
mx missile believe the 100 million for the smaller icbm is a waste 
of funds 
last month some lawmakers said they would introduce an amendment 
to the defense authorization bill to eliminate money for the 
midgetman and rep barney frank dmass estimated that upward 
of 250 house members would back the plan 
how strongly would you object if congress increases the funds 
for the smaller icbm at the expense of other air force programs 
inouye asked rice 
there is no reason said the air force secretary describing 
the planned budget amount for the midgetman as adequate 
on another air force program rice was pleased by cheneys recent 
assessment of the b2 stealth bomber the defense secretary had said 
he needed more time to study the bomber before deciding on whether 
it was worth buying but after a visit last week to the northrop 
plant in palmdale calif where the bomber is built cheney said 
that despite the increasing costs the bomber is worth purchasing 
robert costello the pentagons former undersecretary for 
acquisition had recommended canceling the bomber which recent 
estimates indicate will cost more than 500 million apiece 
inouye said his colleagues in congress have used the total price 
tag for the fleet of b2s estimated at more than 15 billion as 
raw meat for political speeches 
gen larry d welch the air forces chief of staff responded 
that the bomber is uniquely qualified to cover a wide range of 
targets and its development will make it a prototype for future 
generations of aircraft 
welch also argued that the bomber is a good buy noting that the 
b1 bomber was 160 percent more than the b52 while the b2 is only 
a 22 percent increase over the b1 
on another topic sen dale bumpers dark a member of the 
panel questioned welch about the quality of the south korean air 
force and whether us forces estimated at more than 40000 troops 
and a handful of air force squadrons could be withdrawn as a 
costsaving measure 
our presence there is not worth the 2 billion were spending 
to stay there said bumpers who argued that south koreas high 
gross national product and strong armed forces makes the nation 
qualified to take care of itself 
we are still an important part of the stability welch said 
rice urged lawmakers to be careful about the cost issue saying 
it cost less to keep the us forces in south korea than to bring 
them back to the united states

giving clean needles and syringes to drug addicts 
does not promote drug use and is essential for stopping the 
explosive spread of aids among narcotics abusers a researcher said 
wednesday 
and in a strikingly upbeat assessment a leading us health 
official who pioneered the first antiaids drugs predicted that a 
cure for aids will be found 
in the early 50s and 60s there were many people who predicted 
there would be no progress against childhood leukemia they were as 
wrong then as they are about aids now said dr samuel broder 
director of the national cancer institute 
in an address at the fifth international conference on aids 
broder noted that azt the first approved antiaids drug has 
extended the lives of people with aids 
a study of homosexual men showed that they had a 30 percent 
chance of surviving for 18 months with aids in 1982 but a 60 
percent chance by 1987 
i believe the widespread introduction of azt is one factor that 
contributed to this broder said he directed the development of 
azt also known as zidovudine 
in another report wednesday researchers at johns hopkins 
university said they eliminated any trace of the aids virus in a 
single aids patient who was given azt and a transplant of bone 
marrow from a sister whose bone marrow type matched his 
the experiment showed that bone marrow transplants could work in 
aids patients such treatment is unlikely ever to become widely 
available however because matching bone marrow can not always be 
found and because transplants are too expensive to be done on a 
large number of patients 
despite being cleansed of the aids virus the patient died of 
cancer six weeks after the transplant 
the study on drug addicts was reported by dr roel coutinho of 
the public health service in amsterdam the netherlands 
amsterdam began providing needles to its addicts in 1984 addicts 
spread aids by sharing needles and syringes either because that is 
a customary practice or because needles and syringes are in short 
supply 
needle exchanges in which clean needles and syringes would be 
swapped for used needles and syringes were proposed to help stop 
sharing critics feared that such programs would encourage drug 
abuse 
there is no evidence that the needle exchange increased 
intravenous drug use coutinho said sharing of needles among some 
addicts dropped from 56 percent of addicts to 16 percent in one 
study coutinho said 
apparely intravenous drug users are able to change their 
behavior he said if needles are available and if the addicts are 
given intensive counselling about aids and how it can be prevented 
i think that providing needles and syringes is absolutely 
necessary he said 
amsterdam has only about 8000 intravenous drug abusers coutinho 
said making it much different from new york city for example 
where there are about 200000 it is not clear therefore whether 
the lessons learned in amsterdam would apply in new york 
preliminary results from a study of a recently begun needle 
exchange program in new york showed that drug abusers were less 
likely to share their needles and syringes and were more likely to 
clean them with bleach which kills the aids virus 
don des jarlais of the new york state division of substance abuse 
services concluded that the program was substantially reducing the 
risk of aids spread among addicts 
a study in london showed however that needle sharing fell when 
needles were provided but that some addicts also stopped using 
condoms to prevent sexual spread of aids and the incidence of aids 
infection among the addicts increased 
in san francisco needle sharing declined after an exchange 
program was started but 30 percent of the studys participants 
continued to share needles despite the best efforts of the programs

a federal judge on wednesday gave short 
sentences in halfway houses to the first two defendants convicted in 
the pentagon corruption investigation and said their trial had 
revealed purchasing practices that let consultants live a 
parasitic life off the government 
i cant believe our government the congress and executive 
lets a system like this endure us district judge richard l 
williams said in passing sentence on george h kaub and eugene r 
sullivan vice presidents of teledyne electronics of san diego 
kaub was given concurrent sentences of one year each on eight 
counts of conspiracy wire fraud and false statements all but six 
months of the term was suspended 
sullivan drew concurrent sentences of one year each on one count 
of conspiracy and three counts of wire fraud with all but three 
months of the sentence suspended 
the judge directed that the two serve their time in halfway 
houses so that both men can continue to work they have been on 
leave from their jobs 
berkeley baker assistant to the president for public relations 
at teledyne industries inc the parent company of the electronics 
subsidiary said by telephone from los angeles that he understood 
federal law prevented a defense contractor from employing a 
convicted felon however he said the company will want to do the 
humanistic thing and would study the judges ruling 
after completing their time kaub and sullivan will be on 
probation for two years with orders to do 200 hours of unspecified 
community service 
kaub was fined 30000 
sullivan was not fined his lawyer told the court that sullivan 
had no assets except a small equity in a house he bought last year 
with a veterans administration loan 
kaub could have been sentenced to 40 years in prison and fined 2 
million sullivan 20 years and 1 million 
this trial was a window to defense department procurement 
procedures williams said those procedures are so outrageous 
that a world of socalled consultants and as far as i am concerned 
that is another word for rogue are permitted to live a parasitic 
life off the government the judge said 
a jury found the two guilty in april of participating in a scheme 
to hire defense consultant william l parkin who in turn bribed a 
navy official to obtain inside information that would help teledyne 
get a 24 million contract for handheld radardetection kits 
parkin pleaded guilty to bribery charges both he and stuart e 
berlin a former navy engineer who pleaded guilty to receiving 
nearly 5000 in bribes from parkin were sentenced to 26 months in 
prison last week 
williams said a halfway house in the san diego area is expected 
to have an opening within 30 days and the men will remain free until 
then he gave sullivan until aug 2 to surrender so that he could 
attend his daughters wedding july 29 
charges against a third teledyne defendant who stood trial dale 
schnittjer were dismissed after jurors were unable to reach a 
verdict in his case 
a dozen other individuals and two corporations including 
teledyne industries inc have pleaded guilty in connection with the 
justice departments operation ill wind investigation of 
military purchasing fraud 
teledyne pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false 
statements the company based in newbury park calif has paid 
43 million in penalties and fines

president bush was disgusted by a 
republican document that labeled house speaker tom foley a closet 
liberal bushs spokesman said today the author of the memo 
meantime resigned his party post 
bush called lee atwater chairman of the republican national 
committee to complain about the incident and atwater apologized to 
foley said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
we consider the matter closed he added 
meanwhile mark goodin the author of the memo that equated 
foleys voting record with that of rep barney frank an 
acknowledged homosexual resigned today as rnc communications 
director 
goodin was a press assistant in bushs 1988 presidential campaign 
fitzwater said bush who had a 90minute lunch today with foley 
and house republican leader bob michel had no advance knowledge of 
the goodin memo 
he was disgusted by this entire incident the spokesman said 
he said the memo seeking to discredit foley dwash violated the 
spirit of bipartisan cooperation that bush has advocated since 
taking office 
the issue is closed foley said outside the white house 
michel rill told reporters there wasnt all the kind of 
oversight there probably should have been at the rnc it was a 
mistake obviously from the national committees point of view 
michel said he did not know if goodin had been asked to resign 
asked what advice he gave atwater he said i just said theres 
got to be some remedy for what took place and lee its your shot 
do whatever you think is appropriate 
fitzwater said the circulation of the gop memo on foley was to 
be deplored however he said the president retains confidence in 
atwater his former campaign chairman whom he handpicked for the 
party post 
i deeply regret my decision on the foley memorandum goodin 
said in a resignation letter to atwater but he added at no time 
did i ever intend to damage anyones reputation the purpose of 
the memorandum has been misconstrued and in that regard i have no 
one to blame but myself 
he said the memo was sent out without atwaters knowledge or 
approval 
foley said at his first daily news conference as speaker today 
that atwater telephoned him late tuesday and was deeply apologetic 
for any inferences of personal character 
he repudiated the statement and apologized i accepted 
that said foley its regrettable and entirely untrue of 
course i think the matter is now at an end 
foley said atwater promised such attacks would not be repeated 
and added i know of no reason why he wont keep that promise 
foley sworn in as speaker on tuesday in place of a 
scandalscarred jim wright also quoted atwater as saying he 
regretted any inference that the political attack was personal 
michel who had expressed dismay over the attack on tuesday 
called bush today to voice concern and the president was angry 
about the document according to a michel aide 
one democratic leader rep tony coelho of california said bush 
should get involved and see that those responsible for the document 
are fired if republicans want to persuade democrats of their 
sincerity 
theyre playing good cop bad cop coelho said before the 
resignation was announced heres a a guy sent in by bush to do 
the dirty deeds and he calls and apologizes after the fact if 
theyre really upset about these tactics all they have to do is 
fire somebody 
in the statement circulated monday the committee said foley was 
anything but the political moderate some have portrayed him as 
being the document was headlined tom foley out of the liberal 
closet and said foleys voting record was as liberal as that of 
frank dmass 
while foley initially refused to respond to the political 
broadside some democrats in congress expressed fury and michel the 
top republican in the house swiftly moved to distance himself from 
it 
frank accused the gop of spreading extraordinarily scurrilous 
rumors about foley he said tuesday that the republicans had smeared 
the speaker with a sleazy headline 
frank implied to reporters that he thought the rncs decision to 
focus on him was a notsosubtle effort to portray foley as gay 
they put my name on it frank said it was despicable they 
could have picked other liberals and put someone else in the 
headline frank said he might reveal the identity of gay 
congressional republicans if the attacks on democrats continued 
he added the ludicrous part is that effort to make tom foley 
look like an unreasoning partisan its kind of like trying to make 
a snowman dance 
foley initially shrugged off the attack saying im not 
concerned about political action committees i want to work with the 
president work with the leadership of congress 
at a breakfast with reporters a few hours before goodin quit 
edward rollins chairman of the national republican congressional 
committee said goodin had erred seriously 
sometimes you get a little too cute and obviously this is 
something that blew up in his face rollins said if i thought 
it had gone on in my own committee i would fire the person 
goodin earlier defended his work it was not a smear he 
said it has to do with his foleys liberal voting record 
but michel said staffers do not speak for the republican 
party and on occasion they deal in excesses 
frank also referred to a column in the new york daily news that 
quoted an unnamed aide to the house republican whip rep newt 
gingrich of georgia as spreading rumors about foley 
said frank its part of a pattern where they dont have 
anything of any substance to use against people to try and use 
innuendo and rumor

lawyers for the bible speaks church 
cited principles of religious freedom in asking the us supreme 
court to overturn a multimilliondollar award to an heiress who 
claimed she was duped into donating money to the fundamentalist sect 
the church contended in its request for review filed monday 
that the issues raised by the case posed a threat to all religious 
communities especially those whose nonmainstream character 
renders them particularly vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding 
both conscious and unconscious 
you cant unscramble socalled possible secular components 
for making a donation from a combination of reasons most of which 
are religous without offending the constitution said norman roy 
grutman a church attorney 
elizabeth dovydenas of lenox maintained the lenoxbased churchs 
leader carl h stevens conned her into donating 66 million to 
the church in 1984 and 1985 she left the church in 1985 
a federal appeals court found in march that her first donations 
had been freely given and should not be returned but it upheld 
lower court rulings ordering the return of 55 million in 
subsequent gifts 
those who run the church may freely exercise their religion 
but they cannot use the cloak of religion to exert undue influence 
of a nonreligious nature with impunity justice hugh bownes wrote 
in the 1st circuit court of appeals decision 
the case was first heard in us bankruptcy court after the 
church petitioned for chapter 11 protection maintaining that mrs 
dovydenas claim could force it into insolvency after a judge ruled 
in her behalf and a trustee was appointed to oversee the churchs 
headquarters church leaders and dozens of followers abruptly moved 
out of the former prep school in lenox many have since settled in 
the baltimore area 
the property eventually was sold to mrs dovydenas for 35 
million at a bankruptcy auction she has told town officials that 
she plans to turn part of it into a community center

seven weeks after an explosion in a gun 
turret killed 47 crewmen the battleship uss iowa left the norfolk 
naval station on wednesday for a sixmonth cruise to the 
mediterranean sea 
many of its 1500 crewmen wearing dress whites lined the rails 
when the world war ii battleship pulled away and several dozen 
relatives cried waved and hugged each other on the pier 
i dont want him to go out i dont want him to go to the ship 
much less go out said lucrecia hester wife of iowa crewman 
robert hester cradling their 8monthold son cobi 
mrs hester and other relatives said they are worried the ship 
might not be safe since navy investigators have yet to determine why 
the explosion occurred april 19 during a training exercise in the 
atlantic ocean 
its scary said cherrie todd wife of iowa seaman ernest 
todd you dont know what to expect 
mrs todd said her husband would like to transfer off the 
battleship but other crewmen were looking forward to the cruise 
relatives said 
gary jones came with his wife and two daughters from knoxville 
tenn to say goodbye to his son david who is making his first 
lengthy deployment 
hes excited were excited for him gary jones said 
he said his son had talked little about the explosion i think 
hes gone through the whole ordeal real good he said we didnt 
ask him too many questions 
cindy jagel wife of an iowa crewman said she was not concerned 
about the ships safety it doesnt seem to be anything that would 
happen again she said 
the damaged no 2 turret has been cleaned and painted and will be 
used during the voyage to train crewmen who replaced the dead 
sailors said lt cmdr brad goforth a ship spokesman 
but the 16inch guns in that turret and the ships other two 
turrets will not be fired until the navy completes its 
investigation speculation on the cause of the blast has centered on 
faulty gunpowder inadequate training and a crewman who may have set 
the blast to commit suicide shipboard work on the investigation has 
been completed the navy said 
the damaged turret will undergo 13 million in repairs when the 
ship returns from the mediterranean 
the ship still can use its fiveinch guns and surfacetosurface 
missiles goforth said

solidarity plans to support progressive 
communist candidates in the june 18 runoff elections to build on its 
already stunning success in parliamentary elections spokesmen said 
wednesday 
communist officials stung by their widespread rejection in 
polands freest elections since 1947 have been pushing solidarity 
to join some sort of governing coalition with the party 
the independent trade union has so far refused saying it prefers 
to keep its freedom to criticize government policies but its 
electoral dominance has severely undermined the authority of the 
communists and left questions about their ability to govern 
the murky political situation following sundays election was 
expected to be the no 1 topic thursday when representatives of the 
two sides led by solidarity leader lech walesa and interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak meet in warsaw 
official voting results were expected to be issued either 
wednesday night or thursday according to the official news agency 
pap the party has already conceded a decided defeat 
solidarity was limited by a political deal it struck with 
authorities in april to run for only 35 percent or 161 of the 460 
seats in the sejm the lower chamber of parliament 
solidarity says it already has won 160 of those seats and that 
the remaining seat should be sealed up in the june 18 runoffs for 
candidates who failed to win 50 percent of the vote the union said 
but in most cases the candidates of the communist party and its 
allies who ran for the remaining 299 sejm seats did not obtain the 
requisite 50 percent in the first round of voting and will have to 
participate in the second round 
this gives solidarity the opportunity to choose among the 
communist and allied candidates those who most nearly agree with 
solidaritys program 
our opinion is that it is worthwhile to get engaged in the 
second round in order to present to our voters candidates who in 
out estimation are better candidates warsaw campaign chief jan 
litynski told a news conference in the capital 
we want to give all the candidates a chance to present their 
platforms to our voters and we will probably arrange meetings to 
discuss qualifications of the official sides candidates he said 
the meetings would be between the already elected solidarity 
deputies and those hopefuls still in the running for the communist 
party or the allied peasant and democratic party seats he said 
litynski noted that in sundays elections some communistbacked 
candidates already had shown they were more popular with voters than 
others and that solidarity would help make such people more widely 
known 
endorsement by solidarity was virtually tantamount to being 
elected in the first round if the same holds true june 18 
solidarity could be able to determine nearly the entire makeup of 
the sejm 
according to its unofficial tally solidarity already has won 92 
of the possible 100 senate seats and its candidates who must enter 
the runoffs generally were the highest vote getters in their 
districts after the runoffs it appeared possible the union would 
hold all 100 seats 
still undecided is what to do about the 35 seats reserved for 
prominent communist and government officials who were allowed to run 
opposed all the candidates had to do was win 50 percent of the 
vote but voters reportedly have overwhelmingly rejected them 
litynski and national solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
shed little light at the news conference on the progress of talks to 
determine how to fill those seats that are expected to be vacant 
according to solidarity among the defeated is prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski interior minister czeslaw kiszczak and six 
other members on the ruling 17member politburo 
solidarity has promised to allow the party to fill the seats even 
though its candidates were defeated under the april accord that 
made the elections possible and resulted in solidaritys 
legalization solidarity ceded 65 percent of the sejm to the 
communists and their affiliated groups 
solidarity and government representatives held informal talks 
tuesday on the issue but nothing was resolved and the union says it 
still awaits the governments proposed solutions 
onyszkiewicz said kiszczak and walesa would discuss it further at 
thursdays full meeting of the arbitration commission a panel set 
up to resolve any conflicts between the government and opposition 
stemming from their historic accord that liberalized polands 
election process 
we will learn there what are the possibilities for solving this 
problem onyszkiewicz said

troops raked a diplomatic compound with gunfire 
today as military convoys drove through the capital sending more 
foreigners fleeing beijing in fear of open urban warfare 
the us embassys chief of security said bullets flew through 
the window into a room where his two children were watching 
television 
later the state department in washington ordered the evacuation 
from china of all us diplomatic dependents and nonessential 
government personnel and urged all other americans to leave at 
once 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the united 
states was chartering commercial aircraft to fly to beijing and 
shanghai for flights out on thursday 
about 125 us dependents were to leave on one flight the 
embassy said 
many other countries took similar steps to evacuate citizens and 
more than 2000 foreigners jammed the international airport today 
trying to leave 
official television late today blasted the united states for 
providing refuge to astrophysicist fang lizhi the nations most 
prominent dissident who recently said he feared he would be arrested 
in a conservative crackdown 
the 53yearold fang and his wife and child have been at the us 
embassy since at least monday the state department in washington 
said tuesday 
sheltering fang was interference in chinas internal affairs 
the television report said 
chinese witnesses reported more skirmishing between rival armies 
on beijings outskirts 
at least a dozen other chinese cities were wracked by 
demonstrations in protest of the weekend military massacre of 
unarmed beijing citizens which has turned some armies against each 
other 
six people manning a barricade on rails near the shanghai station 
died tuesday when they were hit by a train unable to stop a chinese 
source said angry crowds set the train ablaze 
in beijing troops today shot and killed three people a chinese 
witness said im going home to hunan im afraid for my life in 
beijing said a 25yearold construction worker at the train 
station 
the political situation grew more confusin today with an 
official media report indicating the rising fortunes of qiao shi a 
shadowy figure considered the communist partys lawandorder chief 
none of chinas leaders have been seen since premier li peng 
appeared on television on may 25 five days after declaring martial 
law in beijing li and senior leader deng xiaoping are believed 
behind the crackdown 
the bush administration says the situation is so chaotic in the 
worlds most populous country that it cant tell who is in charge 
and that it appeared likely chinas top leaders have left beijing 
major convoys of troops roared up and down beijings main streets 
throughout the day with a group of nine armored vehicles including 
tanks and nearly 50 trucks heading east just before 11 pm 
thousands of soldiers traveling the same route from central 
tiananmen square this morning chanted we love the people we love 
the capital before opening fire 
it was unclear whether the troops leaving the square were 
evacuating from the city or going to take up positions in the 
suburbs 
they appeared to belong to the 27th army responsible for the 
slaughter of perhaps thousands of people during an offensive that 
began on saturday to clear the city center of students seeking a 
freer society 
several other armies reportedly are in the beijing area chinese 
witnesses said the 27th army clashed early today with units of the 
38th army the beijing garrison with automatic weapons about 12 
miles east of downtown 
the witnesses believed two onlookers died and said they were not 
sure about military casualties 
us intelligence reports indicate the number killed in beijing 
has reached 3000 while a chinese government spokesman said tuesday 
that 300 died 
although most firing appeared to be warning shots into the air 
dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in a compound for 
diplomats and other foreign residents about 2 miles east of 
tiananmen 
my two children were watching television when the bullets came 
flying through the window fred krug chief of security for the 
us embassy told the chicago tribune the chinese maid threw 
herself across the children and covered them 
the bullets just whizzed around the living room it was damned 
hairy its a miracle no one was hit the paper quoted krug as 
saying 
radio beijing said the troops were responding to sniper fire that 
killed one soldier and injured three others the unit was forced 
to fire back and at one time surrounded the diplomats apartments 
and nearby buildings the radio said 
us marines immediately began evacuating americans from the 
compound to the us embassy and krug said his wife and children 
had gone to the embassy 
a diplomatic source said not all residents could be removed 
before chinese troops sealed off the area to search for the alleged 
sniper 
a soviet reporter locked outside urged soldiers to let him 
evacuate his children ive got five kids inside he said im 
supposed to be taking care of them and they wont let me take them 
out 
some diplomats reported that soldiers entered buildings in the 
compound one us diplomat said theyre going room by room our 
apartments are being trashed everything is being ruined 
but several dozen residents later told an associated press 
reporter that troops did not enter the buildings and left after 
about two hours there were no reports of injuries 
one chinese man was dragged off by plainclothes security 
officials who had searched the compound for the alleged sniper 
compound apartments command views of a strategic bridge where 
troops took up defensive positions behind trees curbs and trucks 
the national television newscast today showed chinese reporters 
on a tour of garbagestrewn tiananmen troops appeared sparsely 
deployed and tanks could be seen on the side near the imperial 
palace 
not one person died on the square a martial law official 
claimed the newscast also showed several soldiers recovering from 
wounds they said were inflicted by scoundrels during the weekend 
fighting 
an undetermined number of 27th army troops and tanks remained in 
tiananmen 
diplomats estimated 200000 soldiers from 13 army groups had 
moved into the capital area raising fears of a major battle for 
control of the city of 10 million 
the 27th army is closely linked to president yang shangkun and 
other communist hardliners who ordered the suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement other armies including the 38th are said 
to be close to zhao ziyang the moderate party chief reportedly 
stripped of his post 
muddying the political situation was a xinhua news agency report 
of the supreme peoples court sending a telegram to qiao one of 
five members of the partys policymaking politburo standing 
committee n support of measures to suppress the prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
the report was significant because the message was not sent to 
zhao who was last seen in public on may 19 
diplomats often have named qiao 64 as a top contender to 
replace zhao but little is known of him qiao is the former head of 
the party organization department which is in charge of security

to try anew to forge a longterm national energy policy and said it 
should include tax and price incentives for the development of 
domestic resources even in currently restricted wilderness and 
offshore areas 
democratic gov steve cowper of alaska presenting 
recommendations of the national governors association after an 
18month study declared the nation simply may not be able to 
afford to permanently remove prospectively valuable oil and gas 
areas off its shores in vast areas of the west and in the arctic 
as a personal note he added it is my belief that we 
cannot afford to foreclose development in the arctic national 
wildlife refuge even in the wake of the environmental furor over 
the damage caused by the massive spill of the exxon valdez oil 
tanker any development in currently restricted areas can and must 
comply with the strictest environmental safeguards including 
standards for tanker safety he said 
cowper noted the governors also recommended the export of alaskan 
oil on a barrelforbarrel trade basis with other nations he said 
the current prohibition against such exports reflects the 
political situation at the time the alaska pipeline legislation was 
passed not the real workings of the oil markets or the economic 
realities of oil trade 
i am convinced that such trades would be economically 
beneficial given the high transport cost of moving alaskan oil to 
gulf coast refineries where much of it goes today cowper told 
the house banking subcommittee on economic stabilization the 
nation would not lose oil supplies as the result of these 
transactions 
cowper who was joined by representatives of the governors of 
pennsylvania oklahoma new york and montana acknowledged that 
energy issues are not a central concern to most people today 
despite memories of the oil shocks of the 1970s however he 
said i come before you to say that complacency is both 
unwarranted and dangerous 
the trends are in the wrong direction he said domestic 
oil production is down oil production in other stable and 
friendly nations is down as a percentage of world oil production 
the concentration of oil productive capacity in the persian gulf is 
up and domestic oil consumption is up in the transportation sector 
alone the nation now uses more oil than it produces 
cowper noted the united states imported more than 43 percent of 
the oil it consumed last year and the bill accounted for more than 
onefourth of the us trade deficit what is more he said 
after nearly 15 years of improvement in our efficiency of energy 
use the most recent figures from the department of energy indicate 
that our energy efficiency has started to decline we use twice as 
much energy per unit of gnp as japan and nearly twice that of our 
european trading partners 
he said the governors want congress to take a hard look at a 
variety of incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration and for 
coal including standard investment tax credits on exploration and 
the deregulation of natural gas wellhead prices 
in 1977 congress passed a law requiring the president to develop 
and send to the senate and house comprehensive 5 and 10year energy 
plans and to update them every two years 
despite that law said rep mary rose oakar dohio head of the 
subcommittee this country has no national energy policy plan 
worthy of the name the last plan submitted by president reagan 
in 1986 totaled a mere two pages she pointed out 
ms oakar said the nation has been asleep on energy security 
for the past eight years and that is why the alaska oil spill was a 
wakeup call for america

six days into a bloody crackdown to suppress a 
peaceful movement for freedom the chinese army has failed to pacify 
beijing 
there are numerous reports of clashes between units of the army 
that may be loyal to different political factions 
the massacre saturday and sunday of hundreds of people blackened 
the name of an army onced famed for its bravery and selflessness 
troops once affectionately called brother of the people and 
uncle plaman quickly were termed running dogs and 
fascists by citizens enraged at the killings of relatives and 
friends by their own army 
the events in beijing have raised some questions about the 
discipline and readiness of the peoples liberation army the 
worlds largest army with an active force of more than 2 million 
soldiers 
simple barricades of metal fencing stopped tanks and other heavy 
equipment breaking the drive trains of the vehicles copies of 
1950s soviet models other trucks broke down in the road 
the government announced tuesday that 364 military vehicles 
mostly tanks and armored personnel carriers were burned by unarmed 
citizens 
tear gas used against the tens of thousands of people who came 
out to stop the troops had little effect one canister that landed 
near an associated press reporter briefly made his eyes sting and 
head spin the effects soon wore off 
communications among military units also appeared poor 
on wednesday troops on one beijing bridge scurried behind trees 
concrete fences and trucks as if an attack were imminent the 
assault never came 
on at least two occasions armored personnel carriers driven at 
highrates of speed crushed foot soldiers 
reports of dissension among commanders is adding to the chaos 
on tuesday armies supporting rival factions clashed in front of 
the downtown military museum on wednesday thousands of troops 
moved onto an intersection then retreated as if preparing for urban 
warfare 
troops show a lack of discipline by firing randomly into crowds 
of unarmed citizens 
shots in the air have killed people in highrise apartment 
buildings the windows of one compound housing foreigners was 
riddled by 27 bullet holes wednesday an armored personnel carrier 
crushed at least seven students in a group of thousands that 
retreated peacefully from tiananmen square 
the armys violence has shocked beijing residents 
until the weekend the peoples liberation army held an important 
position in the hearts of many citizens in this capital 
formed in 1927 the army was famed not only for its fighting 
prowess but for its rescue work during disasters and the critical 
help it provided to peasants harvesting crops 
the army goes with the people like fish swims through water 
was a popular proverb 
the pla played a key role in the revolution heeding closely the 
order of marshal zhu de not to steal a pin from the people the 
army gained the affection of chinas peasantry as it battled the 
corrupt nationalists or koumintang and invading japanese 
communist chinas founder mao tsetung recognized this role in 
his famous saying political power grows out of the barrel of a 
gun 
but now the gun has been aimed on the common people 
i lived through the japanese occupation and the kuomintang 
corruption said a 65yearold man never have i seen anything 
like this the army comes from the people how can it kill the 
people 
li tieguo a soldier until last year said he had been proud to 
be a veteran of the army but that turned to horror when he saw 
troops kick a 12yearold girl in the chest and crush her heart 
when i saw these hooligans kill that girl i was disgusted with 
myself he said can these people be my comrades ever again 
the army was one of the four pillars of chinas modernization 
program started by chinese leader deng xiaoping more than a decade 
ago 
so important is the military to dengs planning that the only 
title he has retained is chairman of the central military commission 
under dengs policies the army has undergone a massive reform 
designed to turn it into a professional fighting force it has 
decommissioned more than 1 million troops and purchased vast 
quantities of materiel from the west 
but problems remain 
clashes among units of the army in beijing indicate the army has 
failed to end the factionalism that has plagued the chinese military 
since the warlord period 80 years ago its seven regional armies are 
clearly not all loyal to the same political commanders 
the quality of its soldiers also remains suspect official media 
reports quotes random surveys as saying about onethird of the 
troops are illiterate and say deaf mutes and mental cases have been 
accepted as conscripts

the reunion was held behind closed doors at a state police 
barracks the boys did not comment 
we have lots of things to work out in the next couple of 
months but were going to make it gromer said 
loretta gromer frye picked up the boys for a christmas party and

today 
ms frye 34 is a member of his community a religious group 
founded by roman catholics in kankakee in the 1970s willis said

a cult with strong leadership said the rev james mcdermott of st 
james the apostle church in irwin who worked with the group at its 
early meetings 
willis said several women and children left the area when the 
cult moved in 1979 they were going to be the new exodus from

a cryptic ad in soldier of fortune magazine 
was obviously an offer to kill for money a lawyer for relatives of 
a murder victim said wednesday in an appeal of a 95 million 
judgment against the magazine 
but attorneys for the magazine told a threejudge panel of the 
5th us circuit court of appeals that soldier of fortune had no way 
of knowing that a mans published offer to take on high risk 
assignments would lead to the killing of sandra black in 1985 her 
husband and a gunman are in prison 
the 5th circuit judges gave no indication when they would rule on 
the magazines appeal of a jurys 95 million award to mrs blacks 
son gary wayne black 19 and mother marjorie eimann 65 
john roberson representing the plaintiffs said testimony in the 
trial on their lawsuit made it clear that soldier of fortune 
personal service ads had double meanings 
high risk assignment meant gun for hire in the lingo of the 
magazine argued roberson who cited testimony of an ad manager 
for soldier of fortune 
e barrett prettyman jr lawyer for the magazine said high risk 
assignment could mean gun for hire as a legal bodyguard or for law 
enforcement 
and he rejected robersons argument that the context of soldier 
of fortune aimed at mercenaries survivalsts and gun collectors 
should have led publishers to believe the ad would be used to 
solicit murder 
they plaintiffs concede that the same ad in cosmopolitan or 
kansas city weekly would have been all right said prettyman 
mrs black was shot to death feb 21 1985 at her home about 90 
miles northwest of houston her husband robert was convicted of 
hiring hit man john wayne hearn to kill her after hearn placed an ad 
in soldier of fortune in late 1984 the price for the murder was 
10000 
black is now on texas death row and hearn is in a florida prison 
serving three life sentences for the black killing and two other 
murders in that state 
the ad hearn took out in the boulder colobased magazine of the 
omega group ltd offered the services of an exmarine and vietnam 
veteran with knowledge of weapons for high risk assignments in the 
us and overseas

the state department has ordered the evacuation 
from china of all 258 us diplomatic dependents and nonessential 
government personnel and is urging all other americans to leave at 
once it was announced today 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said us 
ambassador james lilley had protested to vice foreign minister xhu 
qizhan about several instances of rifle fire that broke windows at 
apartments occupied by us government employees she said there 
were no injuries 
the situation in beijing and in china is volatile uncertain 
and increasingly dangerous ms tutwiler said 
therefore secretary of state james a baker iii and us 
ambassador james lilley are strongly urging all american citizens 
to leave china ms tutwiler said 
on tuesday the us government had only urged us citizens to 
leave the capital city of beijing 
ms tutwiler said no us diplomats had been ordered to leave and 
they were attempting to aid other us citizens to get out of the 
country 
the spokesowman said the united states is chartering commercial 
aircraft to fly to beijing and shanghai two widebodied aircraft 
will arrive in beijing on thursday and one will stop in shanghai on 
the way out she said 
the state departments best estimate is that there are fewer than 
1000 americans remaining in beijing she said the us embassy was 
trying to arrange transportation from hotels and other locations to 
the airport for us citizens trying to leave 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we have urged all other americans in china to leave at once 
ms tutwiler said the us government had no evidence that any 
threats had been made directly against american citizens or other 
foreigners but given the increasingly chaotic situation it was 
prudent and wise to order the evacuation 
the embassy in beijing had recommended the evacuation of 
dependents and nonessential diplomatic personnel to secretary of 
state james a baker iii early wednesday said evans gerakas a 
spokesman for the task force on china 
gerakas said the embassy reported that chinese soldiers had 
surrounded an apartment complex housing us diplomats and prevented 
them from leaving the area for some time 
the chinese troops outside the residence of the staff had 
prevented them from getting out but that situation had been cleared 
up and the people were let out and had gone back said gerakas 
as far as i know our people had gone back into the compound to 
pack and get their things 
i can confirm that they the soldiers have left he added 
although most firing appeared to be warning shots into the air 
dozens of bullets struck windows facing the street in a compound for 
diplomats and other foreign residents about 2 miles east of 
tiananmen square 
the us embassys chief of security said bullets flew through 
the window into a room where his two children were watching 
television 
a senior official in washington said the bullets appeared to come 
from the indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to 
clear chinese civilians from the streets 
us officials had said tuesday they could no longer tell who is 
in charge of china and they told americans in beijing to leave as 
quickly as possible 
theres been no communication from the leadership theres no 
indication who the leadership is said fitzwater 
us officials have mounted a wideranging effort using spy 
satellites embassy intelligence and interviews with americans 
leaving china in an attempt to determine what is going on in the 
strifetorn nation but so far the chaos enveloping china has defied 
simple answers 
you cant make judgments based on the situation at the 
moment president bush said after a state dinner tuesday night 
john sununu his chief of staff said the president must be 
careful in his pronouncements about the struggle between 
prodemocracy chinese and hardline government officials 
you dont want to give them the excuse if the president says 
something strong of saying see its being driven externally 
said sununu who also attended the state dinner 
fitzwater said tuesday that chinas senior leaders appeared to 
have left the capital he said the us embassy has been in contact 
with midlevel chinese officials but has had no contact with the 
toplevel people and weve tried 
meanwhile us intelligence reports indicate that the number of 
dead in the weekend attack on prodemocracy protesters in beijing 
had reached 3000 said a us official 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity added that the 
intelligence reports caution that hard evidence about the actual 
number of dead is difficult to obtain in the confused situation and 
that the estimates could go higher 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said baker gave 
the families of the 428 american diplomats and workers at the us 
embassy and the four consulates permission to depart but the 
facilities themselves would stay open 
a state department official said discussions were under way with 
united airlines and northwest airlines to supplement regular china 
service so that one flight a day could carry out americans 
but united spokesman joe hopkins said in chicago that his airline 
had no plans to add flights 
were just operating our regular schedule of three flights a 
week he said

contending the parents of a teenage girl the actor is accused of 
enticing into a videotaped sex session tried to extort 500000 
the documents filed tuesday in fulton county state court say 
lena arlene wilson and her attorney j hue henry of athens used 
extortionist tactics to force lowe to pay a large sum of money 
to avoid adverse publicity the motion says she sought as much as 
500000 in january 
ms wilsons lawsuit contends lowe enticed her daughter lena jan 
parsons then 16 to have sex with another woman while lowe 
videotaped them in his atlanta hotel room last summer 
authorities are investigating whether lowe 24 should be charged 
with sexual exploitation of a minor which carries a 20year prison 
sentence 
lowes attorneys denied any wrongdoing and asked the court to 
throw out the lawsuit and order ms wilson and henry to pay court 
costs 
henry said lowes attorneys initiated the settlement negotiations 
and that the extortion allegations were a desperate tactic i 
expected them to sling all kinds of mud because their client is the 
one on film in compromising positions and there is no way they can 
avoid that fact

cortisone shots appear to speed the recovery of 
premature babies with lung disease helping them get off respirators 
significantly more quickly than usual a study concludes 
doctors gave the synthetic form of cortisone called dexamethasone 
to tiny infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia a form of lung 
disease common in babies born with immature lungs 
they said that the babies treated this way suffered no ill 
effects from the medicine and seemed to avoid some of the 
complications of months on mechanical breathing machines 
the study directed by dr james j cummings of the state 
university of new york health science center in syracuse was 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
however an accompanying editorial by dr mildred t stahlman of 
vanderbilt university in nashville tenn cautioned that studies 
done at single hospitals on small numbers of patients often fail to 
hold up when repeated on larger numbers at groups of hospitals 
an effective and safe treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
is urgently needed she wrote but more definitive data from a 
multicenter trial will be required before the use of dexamethasone 
can be widely recommended 
in the study doctors gave 42 days of dexamethasone to 13 babies 
who weighed less than 27 pounds for comparison they gave 18 days 
of the drug to 12 babies and placebos to 11 others 
those who got the full course of dexamethasone were weaned off 
the respirators after a median of 29 days compared with 73 days for 
those who got less medicine and 84 days for the babies in the 
placebo group 
the babies getting full dexamethasone also were more likely to 
have normal neurological development

the us embassy ordered dependents of its diplomats to leave the 
country the embassies of austria britain canada the philippines

civilian evacuees out by friday 
french italian and soviet diplomats said they had no plans to 
evacuate citizens but the french and italians said many had left 
voluntarily

french embassy staff would be reduced to the indispensable 
minimum because this grand and vast country is on the verge of 
civil war 
an embassy spokesman who would not let his name be used said no 
evacuation was planned because we dont think it is wise to create 
a panic by rushing people out when we dont feel there is an acute 
danger 
he said several wives and children of embassy staff members have 
left voluntarily

as many as 14 million american children suffer 
from some mental disorder a problem that is costing society 
billions of dollars and depriving the nation of productive citizens 
according to a study released wednesday 
there is a stigma associated with mental illness and there is a 
major problem in how childrens problems are perceived said james 
f leckman of yale university the chairman of an institute of 
medicine committee that prepared the study 
mentally ill children have historically been underserved he 
said noting that this is a clear and persistent problem in our 
society 
although the committee said millions of youngsters are not 
receiving the mental therapy they need leckman said the study was 
an optimistic report because the last two decades have witnessed 
breakthroughs in understanding preventing and correcting many 
childhood mental diseases 
the committee recommended that the national institute of mental 
health be given annual budget increases to develop research and to 
train professionals to deal with the specific mental illnesses of 
those under 18 
we must examine our priorities as a nation to ensure that 
these real and persistent problems no longer place in jeopardy our 
most valuable resource future generations of productive 
citizens leckman said 
the report said that a conservative estimate says 12 percent of 
americas children are mentally disturbed but that the true number 
could be as high as 22 percent or about 14 million 
leckman added the likelihood is that the rate is increasing 
of the mentally ill members of the committee said only 20 
percent to 33 percent receive care some studies the experts said 
say the majority of mentally ill children are never even diagnosed 
by parents teachers and doctors 
for the physically handicapped the evidence is that 80 percent 
of those are served said dr fredric solomon director of the 
mental health division of the institute of medicine yet for 
serious emotional disturbance the evidence is that less than 30 and 
maybe less than 20 percent are served even when they are noticed 
solomon said studies have shown that even medical professionals 
such as pediatricians generally recognize only about about 
onefourth of their patients who are suffering from mental 
disorders he said often the children who receive attention are 
those with disruptive behavior 
dr glen r elliott vice chairman of the committee and a 
professor of psychiatry at the university of california san 
francisco said studies have shown a definite increase in childhood 
suicides and in eating disorders 
the report identified a variety of problems besetting americas 
children these include developmental impairments that slow 
education and learning emotional disturbances that include anxiety 
depression or both and behavioral problems that include disruptive 
and antisocial acts 
some of those problems manifest themselves as chronic drug use 
sexual problems and eating disorders 
poverty and associated harsh childraising methods contribute 
heavily to the number of troubled youth the experts said the 
report noted that youngsters with mental and behavioral problems 
may exceed 20 percent in some populations such as innercity 
children who are exposed to severe psychological adversity 
the total cost to the nation has not been measured but leckman 
said it is enormous 
billions of dollars are spent each year in direct service 
delivery said leckman added to this is the tremendous 
emotional burden carried by their families 
childhood depression left untreated may lead to suicide he 
said some disorders such as autism may be a lifelong disability 
other mental problems may lead to drug abuse and criminal behavior 
despite the distress and misery and great costs to society 
relatively few resources have been directed at efforts to advance 
our knowledge said leckman 
the committee said that the nation needs to invest in fundamental 
research to learn how to treat such children and to train 
specialists who can conduct research and treatment 
there are fewer than 100 child psychiatrists who devote 30 
percent of their time to research leckman said the figures are 
equally dismal in psychology pediatrics social work and special 
education 
the committee recommended a nationwide plan directed by the 
national institute of mental health to nurture careers in childhood 
mental health and to sponsor research into methods of preventing 
detecting and treating mental illness in children the report called 
for a national investment that would grow to 198 million annually 
by the fifth year 
the institute of medicine is part of the national academy of 
sciences a private organization chartered by congress as an adviser 
to the federal government in scientific and technical matters

kathy wilhelm has reported for the associated 
press from beijing since 1987 she lives next to the foreign 
compound that was fired at by troops early wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i woke to gunfire wednesday morning 
i almost rolled over and went back to sleep the sound of guns 
has become routine since hundreds of thousands of soldiers rolled 
into downtown beijing last weekend and drove student protesters from 
tiananmen square 
instead i dashed to a window that overlooks changan avenue 
beijings main eastwest street where dozens of tanks and trucks of 
troops were parked two blocks west of my apartment 
peering over the sill i could see no violence only a few dozen 
chinese bicycling under a grim gray sky skirting torn up road 
dividers 
but the import of the shots became clear later chinese 
authorities claimed someone had fired on the troops marching along 
changan avenue from a foreigners apartment in the compound next to 
mine 
dozens of soldiers took up positions outside the compound 
pointing their rifles at the buildings some fired at the buildings 
reportedly knocking out windows dozens more closed the compound 
gates while plainclothes officials searched inside 
eerily a loudspeaker on an army vehicle began playing gentle 
music 
do they want to fight or do they want to dance asked a 
chinese employee watching from a stairwell in the compound 
the simple act of closing the compound gates touched off panic in 
the foreign community those locked inside gathered to plead with 
the impassive soldiers to be let out 
i have a plane ticket and they wont let me out to catch the 
plane said a european diplomat a soviet reporter pleaded in vain 
for permission to evacuate five children 
a long line of cars from various embassies formed outside 
after two hours plainclothes officials collared a chinese man 
who they said fired at the troops and brought him out to the 
soldiers abruptly they formed lines and trotted off 
the gates opened and hundreds of residents rushed to cars and 
vans some bound for the airport and some for hotels further from 
the troop positions 
all but a small group of residents also left the compound where 
the associated press has its office and several staff apartments 
yes we are brave boasted a bulgarian diplomat who stayed 
behind a bulgarian woman living two floors down from him opened her 
door only after much persuasion and perspired with anxiety 
be careful its not safe out there anywhere she urged 
more shops were open wednesday than earlier in the crackdown but 
business was slow far fewer vendors appeared with fruits and 
vegetables 
i loaded as much as i could into my knapsack and bicycle basket 
eggplant and stringbeans were available tuesday but only cabbages 
and tomatoes were in the shops on wednesday prices were heavily 
inflated cutting into my dwindling cash supply banks are closed 
the government warned that water and electricty might be cut if 
order is not restored and i went home and filled jars and buckets 
with water 
gas stations closed early in the turmoil the driver of one of 
the few taxis still operating said he was charging a minumum of 50 
for the airport trip usually a 9 fare he talked one desperate 
passenger into paying 1000 he said 
the international hotel sent guests a cheery letter wednesday 
inviting them to a cocktail party with the management and hoping 
their stay would be memorable but a second letter warned 
stay off the balconies and keep your heavy curtains closed 
away from the foreign neighborhood the mood of panic eased most 
chinese were too nervous to travel to work but they relaxed within 
their walled stone homes in the narrow alleyways 
old men played chinese chess on a canal bank oblivious to 
rifletoting soldiers who roamed a nearby alley in groups of two and 
three 
one man called out to me have you been shot at yet 
two colleagues were ap reporter terrill jones said nonuniformed 
security forces marching in formation down changan avenue shot at 
him twice as he stood outside the international hotel taking 
photographs he fled to the hotel entrance only to find the door 
boarded from the inside 
ap reporter dan biers was on changan further east when an army 
truck approached from the north with soldiers firing out the rear 
he took shelter behind a tree

in an experiment that defies centuries of 
courtroom tradition dakota county district court jurors have been 
allowed to pose written questions of witnesses in a criminal trial 
it made me feel a part of what was going on juror m kathryn 
lease said it was wonderful if i had to do it over again i 
would have asked more questions 
judge gerald kalina and lawyers on both sides also said they were 
pleased with the experiment in the case of a man accused of stealing 
from his employer even though the jurors were unable to reach a 
verdict and the trial ended with a hung jury prosecutors have not 
decided whether to retry the case 
the experiment was part of a study being done by social 
psychologist larry heuer of northwestern university in evanston 
ill and steven penrod a psychologist and lawyer teaching at the 
university of minnesota law school 
they said about 100 judges nationwide have agreed so far to 
participate 
penrod who has done extensive research on juries was attracted 
to the issue of jury participation in the early 1980s when a judge 
in madison wis decided to allow jurors to ask questions 
penrod and heuer then at the university of wisconsin did 
research that included 29 judges and 67 trials across wisconsin 
they found none of the disadvantages that some lawyers and judges 
had predicted that the process would drag out trials or that 
jurors would become involved to the point of taking sides instead 
they found some evidence that jurors were more attentive and more 
confident of their verdicts 
in the dakota county trial m christine misurek an assistant 
dakota county attorney and defense attorney michael mcdonald agreed 
to the experiment 
as each witness finished testifying in response to questions from 
the lawyers kalina asked the jurors if they had questions if they 
did they passed their written questions to the judge he and the 
lawyers discussed whether the questions were appropriate if they 
were the judge read them to the witness 
the defendant allen haram of apple valley was charged with 
conspiring with his brother george potter to steal from harams 
employer brooks superette in lakeville 
according to testimony potter walked into the store feb 27 
wearing a mask the clerk haram gave him money from the safe two 
store supervisors apprehended potter as he was leaving potter 
allegedly told the supervisors that he and haram had staged the 
robbery and both men were charged 
the jurors asked six questions kalina decided two were 
inappropriate but allowed the other four two of those involved the 
stores alarm button since there was some confusion over whether 
haram pushed it the jurors asked about its position and whether it 
is tested periodically 
mcdonald said not all defense attorneys would want the procedure 
used in every trial in some cases he said the more information 
that comes into a trial the likelier it is the defendant will be 
convicted 
you want the jury to go into the jury room with a lot of 
questions because you want them to feel less comfortable in finding 
him guilty you want them to think the state had not met its burden 
in proving him guilty he said

neither sleet nor rain snow nor heat nor 
dead of night will stop the us mail but divebombing sparrows 
now thats a different story 
the postal service has discontinued deliveries to the morse 
family home because the carrier considers birds nesting above it a 
hazard 
mark j morse said the nest is in the rafters of the porch about 
four feet above the mail box and the carrier reportedly told his 
superiors the bird dive bombs him when he attempts to deliver 
the mail 
i really cant understand the reasoning morse said the 
nest was built by a sparrow and most people dont consider sparrows 
to be dangerous birds 
morse said he and other family members have called postal 
officials but were told if carriers feel there is a hazardous 
situation they must deal with they do not have to deliver the mail 
to a home 
postmaster jake zaleski said he was informed of the problem 
tuesday and will take steps to rectify the situation 
i will contact the family zaleski said and see if we 
cant work out an alternate delivery plan i have to consider the 
safety of the carrier and if he thinks there is a hazard i have to 
respect his thoughts

an offshore intake pipe sucked up a 
scuba diver and pulled him 1650 feet through the duct depositing 
him at a nuclear power plant 
i thought i was dead said william lamm 45 who was 
spearfishing when he was pulled into the 16foot diameter 
barnaclestudded pipe off florida power amp lights st lucie nuclear 
plant on the atlantic coast 
it was darker than any dark ive ever seen and i tried to hold 
my arms in front of me for balance but i tumbled and bounced all 
over the sides of the pipe 
lamms trip through the plant coolingwater system ended four 
minutes later in a canal at the power station where a security 
guard saw him surface fpl said the scuba diver was shaken up and 
scraped but not seriously hurt 
lamm said the suction pulled off his mask and diving gloves and 
ripped his mouthpiece out several times as he moved through the pipe 
at 7 feet per second 
the pipeline has no grating but a 70by70foot cap suspended a 
few feet above the opening to reduce suction and prevent the capture 
of foreign objects such as fish and turtles utility spokesman gary 
mehalik said wednesday 
youd have to get up underneath the velocity cap and then 
approach it over the intake to get caught he said 
the intake is marked by a buoy and is listed as a hazard on 
navigation charts mehalik said 
but lamm said he saw no danger signs 
there was a buoy nearby but that marked the shallow water 
he said i got into about eight feet of water and got sucked down 
then in 
the nuclear regulatory commission will investigate said 
spokesman steve horwitz in atlanta 
lamm a scuba diver for five years said it will be a long time 
before he dives again if at all

opponents have finally won the fight to 
block construction of the worlds largest hazardous waste treatment 
plant after a decade of protests and legal battles 
were planning a party a big party said steve irving the 
baton rouge lawyer who handled the opposition 
the final blow for the 135 million plant planned by the it 
corp of torrance calif came quietly when a courtordered 
deadline for appeals passed tuesday 
it did not intend to appeal company attorney maureen 
harbourt said thats it 
the plant would have been built beside the mississippi river near 
burnside and next to the antebellum houmas house frequently used as 
a set for movies 
the lack of an appeal apparently means it is writing off 19 
million already spent on the project including the purchase of 
1100 acres the development of engineering plans and other costs 
paul h templet secretary of the state deparatment of 
environmental quality revoked the companys hazardous waste permit 
on may 8 under law it had 30 days to appeal 
templet said he rescinded the permit because the company did not 
prove the plant would not contaminate groundwater and create other 
environmental problems 
the permit issued to the hazardous waste management firm eight 
years ago had been challenged in a lawsuit filed by save our 
selves a coalition of environmental and citizens groups who said 
the plant would create more problems than it solved 
when we started out this was a state program said irving 
state officials were involved all the wheels were greased 
part of the game plan was to ram it down our throats he 
said make it an existing facility 
the opponents successfully stalled the permit process long enough 
to keep the plant from establishing a legal standing 
then they won a ruling that it violated the state ethics code by 
preparing its own feasibility study of the site for the state 
we knew that if we deprived them of making a quick killing it 
would die of its own weight he said

violence against gay people continued to be 
alarmingly widespread last year said a report released 
wednesday by the national gay amp lesbian task force 
a total of 7248 incidents ranging from harassment to homicide 
were reported to the group in 1988 by 120 organizations in 38 states 
and the district of columbia 
about twothirds of the incidents were verbal harassment 
according to the report the remainder were physical assaults 12 
percent threats of violence or menacing 10 percent vandalism 6 
percent police abuse 3 percent bomb threats 1 percent and 
homicide arson and other 1 percent the other category 
includes police negligence attempted violence and one kidnapping 
as in past years antigay violence and victimization proved to 
be alarmingly widespread in 1988 author kevin berrill said at a 
news conference called wednesday to release the annual study the 
groups fourth 
this report does not claim to measure the full extent of 
antigay violence and victimiazation that occurred last year he 
added without question the vast majority of antigay episodes in 
1988 were not counted 
claudia brenner of ithaca ny victim of one of the more 
vicious antigay episodes last year spoke at the news conference 
because its too easy in our world of murder and death statistics 
to forget that there are actually people behind the numbers 
the fact that crimes are targeted against particular groups 
in this case lesbians requires a societal response brenner 
said calling for passage of the hate crime statistics bill which 
is pending in both houses of congress 
brenner a 31yearold architect was camping in pennsylvania 
with her lover rebecca wight last may when a man who had been 
stalking them in the woods opened fire wight was killed but brenner 
survived despite being shot at least five times their assailant 
stephen roy carr was convicted of firstdegree murder and sentenced 
to life in prison without parole 
the report noted a disturbing rise in the number of hate groups 
mostly neonazi skinheads attacking gay people 
although most of the perpetrators of antigay violence are not 
affiliated with organized hate groups hate groups pose an 
unprecedented and growing threat to the lesbian and gay community 
berrill said nineteen organizations representing 17 communities 
across the us reported antigay activity by hate groups last year 
most of it perpetrated by neonazi skinheads 
the report also provides evidence that homosexuals are being 
increasingly victimized on college campuses 
nineteen percent of the antigay incidents reported last year 
took place on college campuses the report found seventeen percent 
were classified as aidsrelated indicating that hatred and blame 
associated with the epidemic continue unabated 
there were 240 more incidents documented in 1988 than in 1987 
the report said it attributed the increase to a special request for 
information from the metropolitan community churches which have a 
special ministry to the gay and lesbian community and to campus gay 
and lesbian organizations

walked six abreast and stretched down several streets 
most wore black or white clothes traditional chinese funeral 
attire and many carried banners denouncing chinese leaders and 
praising the prodemocracy demonstrators ousted by soldiers from a 
central square in beijing nine days ago hundreds of people died in

a 1978 agreement requiring the navy to buy 
cruisemissile engines from a defense contractor in michigan is 
illegal and will be canceled the navy has told a senator in a 
letter made public wednesday 
according to the letter dated april 11 from thennavy 
undersecretary h lawrence garrett iii to sen carl levin dmich 
the openended multimilliondollar agreement with williams 
international of walled lake mich was negotiated by william 
parkin 
parkin a consultant and a former navy employee and the former 
navy engineer he bribed were given 26month prison terms june 2 for 
illegally scheming to help two companies get pentagon contracts 
parkin and stuart berlin were each fined 25000 and ordered to 
serve two years of supervised probation after their release from 
prison parkin pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed berlin to 
provide secret navy bid information that would help teledyne 
industries inc and hazeltine corp of long island ny obtain 
lucrative contracts to sell electronic equipment to the pentagon 
the garrett letter to levin was made public by the project on 
military procurement a washingtonbased whistleblower group 
danielle brianbland a spokeswoman for the group declined to say 
how the letter was obtained 
the associated press sought comment from the navy on the 
agreement the navys press office said it was unable to provide 
information immediately both the navy and levins office confirmed 
the existence of the garrett letter 
the agreement guarantees williams a certain level of engine sales 
to the navy without the agreement williams would be required to 
compete for contracts with teledyne industries inc the other 
supplier of the engines williams is fighting the navys decision 
williams and the navy negotiated the agreement in order to 
provide the defense department with a second source for cruise 
missiles said linda gustitus staff director of the senate 
subcommittee on oversight of government operations which levin 
heads 
williams licensed some of its technology to teledyne and in 
return the defense department agreed to buy at least 240 engines a 
year from williams plus 25 percent of any additional purchases up 
to 1200 engines annually 
the agreement contains no ending date and purports to apply not 
just to the contract with which its negotiation was associated but 
to all government contracts for f107 engines its derivatives and 
associated logistic items having cruisemissile applications 
wrote garrett who is now secretary of the navy 
the navy under the agreement must contract through williams in 
buying engines from teledyne williams has been paid about 36000 
for each of the 708 engines built by teledyne garrett wrote 
such provisions violate a 1984 amendment to defense purchasing 
legislation designed to ensure competition in pentagon procurement 
because it binds the government to reward future contracts garrett 
wrote levin was an author of the amendment 
in a may 12 letter made public by levin a navy contracting 
officer frances l bradley told williams the agreement wasnt 
authorized by purchasing laws in effect when the deal was negotiated 
the f107 engine is used in seabased tomahawk cruise missiles 
the government ought to keep its word levin said wednesday 
the government made a contract and under the constitution you 
cannot abrogate a contract 
the 1984 law applies only to new agreements not to existing 
ones and so the agreement with williams is within the law levin 
said i dont concede in any way the 1984 law was violated by the 
contract even if it came after the 1984 law levin said 
williams vice president for public relations david jolivette 
declined to discuss the issue on the advice of counsel saying the 
matter had not yet been resolved

the new us ambassador to britain 
laid a wreath wednesday at a memorial to the 270 people who died in 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 and he faced angry protest from a 
victims wife 
wendy giebler of hasbrouck heights nj said us officials have 
been rude and cruel to relatives of flight 103 victims she also 
accused investigators of witholding information 
we want to know why it was possible to get the bomb aboard and 
why pan am did not react to warnings said mrs giebler wife of 
flight 103 passenger william giebler who died in the dec 21 
bombing 
after the ceremony at dryfesdale cemetary mrs giebler 26 
called for an independent investigation to supplement the work of 
scottish police the fbi and other law enforcement agencies 
she spoke only briefly to us ambassador henry catto who 
visited northern ireland and lockerbie this week after taking up his 
post in london last month 
at a news conference later catto said he would be surprised if 
anyone had been rude to relatives and he expressed satisfaction 
with the progress made by the investigation based in lockerbie 
initiatives have been taken to increase airport security to 
cooperate in law enforcement and bring the scourge of terrorism to 
an end catto said 
mrs giebler a member of the victims of flight 103 group said 
she came across the ceremony by chance 
not only is the us government not doing enough to bring the 
terrorists to justice it is not keeping the relatives informed of 
what went on she said i do not believe anything has been done 
by the government to protect people flying today mrs giebler 
said 
the chief investigator john orr of the strathclyde police has 
said the plane was brought down by a bomb planted in a 
radiocassette player and detonated by an altitudesensitive trigger 
the device probably was put aboard the flight in frankfurt west 
germany and transferred to the boeing 747 during a stop at londons 
heathrow airport orr has said

military officials wednesday 
called off a search for seven missing gold prospectors believed 
trapped in makeshift mine tunnels during a landslide that killed at 
least 13 people 
there were no more signs of life inside the shafts that collapsed 
on may 30 and continuous rains made further digging risky according 
to brig gen mariano baccay the regional philippine police chief 
baccay said five people had been rescued from the collapsed 
tunnels on the slopes of mount diwalwal a goldmining community in 
davao del norte province 
heavy rains caused a maze of tunnels on the mountain to collapse 
and triggered a fire that razed at least 160 shanties of miners and 
traders 
baccay said 13 bodies were recovered he said 750 miners were in 
the tunnels at the time of the accident but most made their way to 
the surface through two large tunnels that did not collapse

more than 9000 soldiers have been unable to halt 
the bloody ethnic violence in uzbekistan president mikhail s 
gorbachev reported wednesday 
he told the soviet congress arson and killing continued in the 
central asian republic soviet media reports said the death toll had 
reached 67 and authorities had lost control 
accounts in staterun media on the strife in the in the fergana 
valley 1500 miles southeast of moscow said some people were stoned 
to death and others perished under the burning debris of houses 
one thing is clear the local authorities have lost control of 
the situation failed to cope with it on their own the official 
news agency tass reported from uzbekistan 
vremya the evening television news program said houses were set 
afire tuesday night in the city of fergana and authorities had 
received word that a cruel crowd of hooligans made an ethnic 
attack in kokand 40 miles to the northwest 
to protect them from marauding uzbeks several thousand members 
of the meskhi turk ethnic minority were moved to a temporary camp 
outside fergana in the steppe under the scorching sun tass said 
helicopters and armored personnel carriers are patrolling 
fergana a city of more than 200000 people tass said and the 
communist party daily pravda said 9000 interior ministry troops 
were in the eastern uzbekistan valley trying to maintain order 
violence in the grape and cottongrowing region began may 2324 
after a dispute in a bazaar when a meskhi turk spoke rudely to a 
fruit vendor because he thought her prices were too high and knocked 
over her plate of strawberries uzbekistan communist party chief 
rafik nishanov said 
that incident triggered a marketplace brawl and in later 
paryoxyms of ethnic violence that reached a crescendo last weekend 
more than 400 houses 116 cars eight industrial enterprises and 
some schools and government offices were torched or wrecked tass 
said 
youths aged from 16 to 20 drunk or on drugs performed 
barbarous reckless actions tass said it said 56 people had been 
killed including many women and children but the communist youth 
daily komsomolskaya pravda said the death toll had climbed to 67 
most of those who lost their homes were meskhi turks the 
newspaper said the entire population of 300000 meskhi were 
uprooted from their homeland in soviet georgia by dictator josef 
stalin in 1944 and shipped to the soviet east for forced 
resettlement 
in moscow a somber gorbachev told the congress of peoples 
deputies that authorities had the situation in the fergana valley 
under control but that there were still incidents of arson and 
killings 
it has not changed for the better gorbachev said it 
concerns us very much 
the congress joined him in appealing to uzbeks and meshki turks 
both of whom are traditionally moslem to halt the bloodshed it was 
the second such appeal issued this week 
the turkish minority which adopted islam centuries ago has been 
pressing its demands to be allowed to return to its ancestral 
homeland in georgia since the national parliament began meeting in 
moscow late last month 
authorities charged with keeping order in the fergana valley 
openly admitted the situation was still volatile and ethnic hatreds 
keen 
despite the heavy military and police presence tass reported 
that as recently as tuesday night gunshots were heard in several 
neighborhoods in fergana 
the violence was the latest ethnic dispute to erupt in the 
southern soviet union where disputes in the caucasus region and in 
central asia have killed scores of people and left thousands 
homeless 
a national outcry followed the use of chemicals shovels and 
clubs by soldiers who broke up a proindependence rally in georgia 
on april 9 nineteen civilians were killed in the assault and one 
was later shot by soldiers for violating curfew 
in his remarks to the congress gorbachev seemed to demand a firm 
but measured response in dealing with the fergana violence 
the developments in uzbekistan show once again that we should 
be patient reserved and alert and should bear responsibility for 
our actions in everything especially in what concerns interethnic 
relations the soviet leader said

the state department calling the situation in 
china volatile uncertain and increasingly dangerous ordered 
the evacuation on wednesday of its 258 diplomatic dependents and 
urged all other private americans to leave as soon as possible 
secretary of state james a baker iii and us ambassador james 
lilley are strongly urging all american citizens to leave china 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler told reporters 
the situation is deteriorating she said 
the evacuation order and the new warning to private citizens 
reflect a heightened concern by the us government about the 
situation in beijing as well as in the provinces outside the 
capital the united states has no legal authority to force private 
americans to leave the country 
on tuesday the department had urged private us citizens only 
to leave beijing the center of the turmoil sparked by weeks of 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
the evacuation was ordered after chinese troops raked a 
diplomatic compound with gunfire and another incident in which 
chinese soldiers surrounded an apartment complex housing us 
diplomats and prevented them from leaving the area for some time 
no americans were injured ms tutwiler said 
the situation in beijing and in china is volatile uncertain 
and increasingly dangerous ms tutwiler said 
she refused to describe the situation in the country as civil 
war 
but the spokeswoman who said a day earlier that she couldnt 
verify that fighting among the military had occurred confirmed that 
some clashes between small army units had taken place 
the united states has chartered commercial aircraft to fly to 
beijing and shanghai to supplement regular us airline departures 
also officials have organized transportation to help us citizens 
get to the airports the spokeswoman said 
she said that the road to the beijing airport remained open and 
that chinese officials are allowing the extra charter flights to 
land 
two aircraft one from united airlines and another from 
continental airlines will leave beijing thursday and there is a 
possibility of a third she said 
a regularly scheduled flight is slated to leave friday other 
planes will be chartered if necessary she added 
their purpose is to facilitate the departure of all those who 
want to leave and all those who have been ordered to leave she 
said 
ms tutwiler said she did not know the exact destination of the 
flights 
although the shooting at the diplomatic compound appeared to be 
warning shots fired into the air dozens of bullets struck windows 
facing the street in the housing area for diplomats and other 
foreign residents about 2 miles east of tiananmen square 
the us embassys chief of security said bullets had pierced a 
window into a room where his two children were watching television 
an administration official who spoke on condition he not be 
named said us officials believe that 84yearold deng xioaping 
who has been reported in ill health is still alive and still 
running the show 
the official noted that while the us government cant order 
private citizens to leave the country a real change of 
atmosphere has taken place in recent days and that more and more 
people have decided to leave the country 
the official said that there are a fair number of children 
among the 258 dependents and nonessential personnel who have been 
ordered to leave and that officials are making sure every child is 
accompanied by either a parent or a friend on the flights out of the 
country 
ms tutwiler said ambassador lilley had met with vice foreign 
minister xhu qizhan and registered a strong protest about an 
incident of rifle fire that broke windows in apartments occupied by 
us government employees 
ms tutwiler said the us government had no evidence that any 
threats had been made directly against americans or other foreigners 
but given the increasingly chaotic situation it was prudent and 
wise to order the evacuation 
the chinese government meanwhile notified the department that 
it had decided to postpone next weeks visit of foreign minister 
qian qichen 
our government agreed it was wise to postpone the visit at 
this time the spokeswoman said she said the chinese gave no 
explanation for the change of plans 
ms tutwiler emphasized that no us diplomats had been ordered 
to leave adding that their presence was necessary to aid the 
departure of other us citizens 
the spokeswoman said the state departments best estimate is 
that there are about 1000 americans still in beijing 
although some 8800 americans had notified us officials in 
january that there were somewhere in china we do not have any 
accurate number of how many americans are in china at the present 
time she said 
she added that the number of americans appears to have 
dramatically been reduced over the last several days as us 
businesses have asked their workers to leave 
besides leaving on the usflag carriers americans have also 
departed on other national carriers ms tutwiler noted she said 
that if there are extra seats on the us planes citizens from 
other nations will be allowed to use them

namibia if guerrilla attacks were staged from the territory south 
africa has ruled for 74 years 
the namibian newspaper which supports the south west african 
peoples organization guerrillas said the secret meeting of the 
nowdefunct national security council raises questions whether 
free and fair elections can be held in november as scheduled 
under a un independence plan for the territory 
the sept 7 talks included cabinet members of namibias interim 
government the heads of the territorial army and the police as 
well as andries visser namibias chief electoral officer according

that swapo boycotted because they were based on race 
south africa is in charge of implementing the independence plan 
which took effect april 1 more than 4000 un personnel are in

clear if it will be able to capture the twothirds majority needed 
to control the formation of a new government 
the guerrilla movement has fought a 23year bush war against 
south african rule 
swapo officials were not immediately available for comment 
however they have repeatedly accused south african officials the 
security forces and even un officials of being biased against the 
guerrilla movement 
the un special representative to namibia martti ahtisaari has 
raised the matter with pienaar according to a un statement 
the statement stressed the need for strict impartiality in 
the elections un spokesmen declined to elaborate 
as part of the independence process botha on tuesday approved 
the repeal of security laws that banned the african national 
congress and other antiapartheid guerrilla organizations in the 
territory

conservative party in south africa that the action would make it 
possible for the anc to operate from namibia botha issued his 
warning 
botha said in a letter to the conservative party that pienaar had 
the ability to prohibit south african members of the anc or other 
organizations from coming into the territory pienaar remains in 
charge of the territory until a new government is installed 
expected some time next year 
after the territory becomes independent botha said the south 
african government will not hesitate to send the south african 
police and defense force into namibia if it appeared that the anc or 
other organizations were launching operations against south africa 
from the territory

a leader in the usbased opposition to 
former philippine president ferdinand marcos and a hero to the 
current government was acquitted wednesday of illegally shipping 
explosives for use against marcos 
a us district court jury deliberated a day and a half before 
finding steven psinakis 57 innocent of conspiring and taking part 
in the shipment of detonating cord from st louis to san francisco 
he could have been sentenced to 15 years in prison 
truth and justice prevails psinakis declared as he shook 
hands with his lawyer james brosnahan

administrations had conspired to destroy freedom and democracy in 
the philippines to maintain a ruthless and corrupt 
dictatorship 
psinakis a greekborn us citizen and husband of a prominent 
philippine woman was a leader for more than a decade in the 
movement for a free philippines a usbased group made up largely 
of philippine exiles opposed to marcos who left the philippines 
during a popular revolt in february 1986 
other leaders included sen benigno aquino who was later 
assassinated and whose wife corazon now is president of the 
philippines and raul manglapus currently foreign affairs secretary 
under mrs aquino 
manglapus was a defense witness for psinakis mrs aquino 
intervened in getting psinakis freed on 250000 bail after his 
arrest in 1987 others in her government denounced the charges and 
warned that a conviction could harm usphilippine relations 
prosecutors denied political motivation throughout and said they 
had evidence that psinakis was the mastermind of a plot to transport 
explosives to be used in a campaign of bombings against the marcos 
government in 1981 
evidence included two wiretapped telephone calls from st louis 
physician arturo taca to psinakis in which the two men discussed a 
need to get 40 and 60 which the prosecution said were 
references to weights of detonating cord 
a letter was found in psinakis home that referred to stripping 
the rope allegedly meaning a removal of explosive powder from the 
detonating cord six hundred feet of stripped detonating cord was 
found in psinakis garbage and powder identified by the fbi as 
explosives was recovered from tools in his san francisco house 
the defense seized on gaps in the fbi investigation including a 
period of more than five hours that the garbage sat unattended after 
its seizure to suggest that incriminating evidence had been planted 
by marcos agents who were following psinakis 
psinakis was indicted in december 1986 just before the 
expiration of the fiveyear legal deadline and 10 months after the 
fall of marcos 
psinakis attributed the prosecution to an alleged promise to 
marcos by ronald reagan just after his election as president in 
1980 to target the philippine dictators us foes for 
investigation defense attempts to dismiss the case before trial on 
the grounds of selective prosecution were rejected by us district 
judge robert schnacke 
marcos illness has prevented him from traveling from his exile 
home in hawaii to new york to face racketeering charges alleging he 
plundered his homeland of more than 100 million and used the money 
to buy real estate and art in the united states 
marcos was described as resting comfortably wednesday after 
emergency surgery for an abdominal infection but his prognosis for 
recovery remains poor a hospital spokesman said

members of a house panel on aging said 
wednesday the federal government should do more to help states 
combat the growing problem of abuse and neglect of the elderly 
how much abuse there is cannot be documented but only a fraction 
of the cases are reported to state authorities the panel was told 
members want to see the national government play a more active 
role rep tom downey dny told michio suzuki acting deputy 
commissioner of the administration on aging in the department of 
health and human services at a house subcommittee hearing 
downey chairman of the human services subcommittee of the house 
select committee on aging acknowledged that the federal effort has 
been hamstrung by lack of public awareness of the problem and cuts 
in available funds funding cutbacks but he said were prepared 
to give you more resources 
rep louise slaughter dny questioned how suzukis agency 
could address the problem without a clear picture of its national 
scope and added im not sure a federal passive role is going to 
help 
suzuki rejected the description of his agency as passive he 
said the office plays an active role in a supporting role by 
providing assistance to states 
the administration on aging has long recognized that prevention 
of elder abuse is primarily a state responsibility and a state 
prerogative he told the panel 
but downey and other members noted that the federal government 
has made many efforts to take the lead in fighting child abuse 
including monitoring state activities 
it seems to me that what would be of national interest in the 
younger years of life would be of national concern in the older 
years of life he said 
suzuki said the federal agency has not evaluated individual state 
efforts to prevent abuse and neglect of older americans but is 
trying to be responsive to states needs in developing programs 
supplying educational materials and enhancing public awareness 
though states are not required to spend any of the money they get 
from the agency on protective services 40 states do allocate some 
of their federal funds to these services he said 
states are as interested in this as we are he said 
suzuki said his agency relies on the national aging resource 
center on elder abuse to gather information on the scope of the 
problem and the efforts of the states the center operated by the 
american public welfare association the national association of 
state units on aging and the university of delaware receives 
federal funds 
toshio tatara director of the center testified that because the 
reporting systems in many states are incomplete it is impossible to 
estimate accurately the extent of the problem 
he said state surveys turned up 140000 reports of abuse of the 
elderly last year but he said that represents only a fraction of 
the incidents 
one study found that only one of 14 cases gets reported which 
would mean that last year there would have been nearly 2 million 
reportable cases he said 
elder abuse is far less likely to be reported than child abuse 
about which the public has gained greater awareness of the problem 
than it has about elder abuse he said 
tatara called for better coordination of federal programs and 
regulations 
as an example he cited a federal medicare and medicaid policy 
that he said contributes to patient neglect under that policy 
the cost of a medical device that prevents bed sores is not covered 
though the cost of treating bed sores is he said

inception was known as the last of the new deal liberals 
asked if she would continue peppers programs she said i am 
not senator pepper i am ileana roslehtinen we have many common 
values and many common philosophies we have some differences 
she identified her priorities as bridging ethnic and social 
differences protecting social security the war on drugs and crime 
a tough stand on cuba and nicaragua and strong support for israel 
perez called his announcement a show of his pride in his adopted 
country 
i feel very proud about the united states i feel very proud of 
being an american perez said 
in his 1984 stateoftheunion address reagan told perezs story 
of coming to this country as a destitute immigrant and building a 
multimilliondollar banana importing business perez raised funds 
for reagan and formed a fundraising committee for former national 
security adviser oliver north 
pepper with nationwide prestige won every election for the 
district since his first in 1962 with his closest race in the past 
decade a 6139 percent victory in 1984 over cubanamerican ricardo 
nunez he drew no opposition last year at age 88

foreigners fleeing beijing were returning to their 
homes wednesday with terrifying stories of the killings they saw and 
the chaos they left behind 
they flew to tokyo hong kong and other cities after several 
countries ordered their citizens to leave the chinese capital where 
soldiers have killed or wounded thousands of people in crushing a 
prodemocracy movement 
i saw a soldiers body burned hanging from the bridge that 
made me get the hell out of there australian tourist jimie reid 
said in hong kong he said people told him the soldier had killed 
children and women 
we were shot at by the tanks at the peking hotel doorway they 
were shooting at anything that moved said yves robert a french 
tour guide after arriving in paris with a group of 40 tourists 
i came out to the veranda of the minzu hotel to see what was 
happening and gunfire from a tank hit the veranda about 50 
centimeters 20 inches above my head japanese businessman 
ryoichi kikukawa said in tokyo 
peter white an english teacher from ithaca ny got up before 
dawn wednesday to line up for a ticket on the same japan airlines 
flight 
as he was about to enter a taxi in front of his hotel white 
said he threw himself to the ground because of gunfire from 
soldiers which shattered windows on upper floors i think it was 
their way of telling us to get back inside he said 
white expressed concern for 20 american friends including a 
pregnant woman he believed were still in beijing 
in frankfurt donald pierrelouis said theres chaos even 
panic at the airport everybody is trying to leave beijing 
pierrelouis a 34yearold a native of haiti arrived with his 
wife danielle and their two young children 
he said they kept up with events by watching american cable 
television at their hotel 
they cut off our phones for nearly two days but for some reason 
they left the television on he said the more we saw the more 
afraid we got 
carol benedict a graduate student at stanford university who was 
doing research in beijing said in tokyo gasoline is a problem 
she said her taxi driver said he had only enough for one more trip 
and all the gasoline stations are closed 
one american woman who arrived in tokyo on wednesday had been in 
a dormitory where soldiers entered firing guns killing a number of 
students according to her friends she was too upset to talk to a 
reporter 
the airline offices were just two blocks from our hotel but 
with all the tanks out there and gunfire it was too long a walk to 
risk said benedict 
an american professor at beijing university was stopped along 
with eight other americans in a van on the road to the airport by 
chinese soldiers who took their baggage money tickets and vehicle 
the group had to walk an hour further to the airport the teacher 
told junichi nagano a japan airlines supervisor at narita airport 
near tokyo 
many others on china airlines flight 925 also arrived in tokyo 
with no baggage or money nagano said 
ms benedict told of a group of seven american students who tried 
to stick together in their efforts to escape helped by a japanese 
student who found them airline tickets but he could get them only 
three tickets and we had to leave the other four behind 
benedict said 
the last we knew they were out on changan avenue trying to get 
to the airline offices but that was where the heaviest fighting was 
going on i dont know what happened to them she said 
she said the lack of reliable information was the main problem 
it was very difficult to get phone calls through people were 
getting hysterical said benedict who moved around trying to find 
a safe spot in beijing clutching a shortwave radio to get bbc 
reports on what was happening in various parts of the city 
there were hordes of people at the airport it was hot and 
humid kids everywhere people near panic thinking today i have to 
get out at all costs she said adding that she heard loud booms 
that sounded like artillery fire within range of the airport 
some embassies under gunfire seemed overwhelmed with the task 
of evacuating their citizens leaving some feeling stranded 
the american embassy made it very clear that transportation 
arrangements were up to us said white who said he was worried as 
other embassies pulled out their students leaving him at his 
university as the last foreigner with no clear directions from the 
embassy whether to stay or leave 
the us embassy sent a convoy to bring american students to 
safety monday but some students unsure whether they were safer on 
campuses where army units were rumored to be preparing a strike or 
downtown where gunfire was already rife stayed behind 
chinese cheered the american convoy of a halfdozen vehicles led 
by a limousine flying an american flag and flashed victory signs as 
it wound through the city trying to find a safe route benedict said 
chinese people are clearly looking to the american government 
and the american people for support and that seems to put american 
citizens at risk because the chinese government will try to 
suppress that kind of thinking she said

new house speaker tom foley said wednesday that 
republicans are right in complaining democrats have at times 
overplayed their power as the majority party and he vowed to wield 
a gentler gavel 
i think weve pushed it sometimes to the point where while we 
were still within the rules we were making maximum use of the power 
of the majority or the position of the majority foley said i 
dont think we should do that 
foley in his first full day as speaker commented in an 
interview with news service reporters 
he specifically referred to an incident on sept 27 1987 when 
thenspeaker jim wright held open a house rollcall vote long enough 
to get one democrat to change his vote on a crucial budget bill and 
provide the margin of victory i think we went too far on that 
day he said 
foleys comment seemed to concede a point made a day earlier 
when he was sworn in before the full house by republican leader 
robert michel of illinois michel said then thirtyfive years of 
uninterrupted power can act like a corrosive acid upon the 
restraints of civility and comity 
in a wideranging interview foley also said 
he hopes to enact before the year is out legislation to reform 
house ethics rules and campaign laws such legislation probably 
would have to address the issues of honoraria or speaking fees and 
a federal pay increase 
he said the ethics committees enforcement process is somewhat 
awkward to put it kindly and suggested its duties be divided 
between two panels one to determine whether to bring charges 
another to judge the merits of the case 
but foley said he did not think congress was mired in a moral 
swamp because of recent highprofile ethics cases involving his 
predecessor wright and no 3 democratic leadership official rep 
tony coelho both of whom have announced they will leave congress 
as speaker he will be a staunch supporter of civil rights and 
civil liberties and will be devoted to improving educational 
opportunities in the united states he said the nation is falling 
behind countries such as japan and south korea in math and science 
education in particular 
a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be needed 
to bring the nations deficit under control but democrats will not 
on their own suggest a tax hike 
foley said such a tax recommendation would be an exercise in 
futility for all of us since if congress sent a tax increase to 
the white house president bush would likely shoot it twice and 
throw it down the white house well 
it is time to concentrate on governing he decried political 
operatives in both parties who he said spend their days searching 
for confrontation and seem to want a sort of permanent election 
he added that americans dont want to make washington a permanent 
political battleground 
meanwhile rep mickey edwards of oklahoma chairman of the house 
republican policy committee said if foley is serious about 
bipartisanship he should support a package of rule changes proposed 
by the gop five months ago democrats totally ignored the 
proposals under wrights leadership he said 
there is a new leader and tom foley has a different style 
edwards said adding that wright systematically excluded the 
views opinion debate amendments of people who disagreed with the 
leadership whether democrats or republicans 
earlier foley went to the white house for his second meeting 
with bush in as many days praising the presidents willingness to 
consult he said the luncheon was largely social although a few 
issues coming before congress soon were discussed generally 
he brushed aside republican criticism including a republican 
national committee memo that stirred considerable controversy 
early wednesday the gop committee announced the resignation of 
its communications director mark goodin who had written a memo 
titled tom foley out of the liberal closet that compared 
foleys voting record to that of rep barney frank an acknowledged 
homosexual 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president had been 
disgusted by this entire incident and had called rnc chairman 
lee atwater who had telephoned foley to apologize 
he repudiated the statement and apologized foley told 
reporters at the capitol i accepted that along with a promise 
that such attacks would not recur 
foley was sworn in as the houses 49th speaker on tuesday to 
replace wright who stepped down after the ethics committee lodged 
charges of financial impropriety 
foley and house gop leader robert michel rill went to the 
white house for lunch with bush and foley sought to focus attention 
on legislative matters the house is taking up or will soon consider 
foley called the meeting with bush a sign of a budding 
cooperative spirit between the executive and legislative branches 
and between the parties 
the president is seeking opinions he said specifically 
referring to clean air legislation its another example of this 
presidents willingness to consult fully 
foley also sought to refocus attention on the democratic agenda 
of social issues mentioning child care health care and an 
increase in the minimum wage thats what the american people 
elected the congress to address he said 
foley appointed rep tony coelho dcalif to be acting majority 
leader until next wednesday when the democrats will fill the no 2 
leadership post as well as the no 3 slot of majority whip 
rep richard gephardt dmo is favored to replace foley as 
majority leader but is opposed by rep ed jenkins dga there is a 
threeway race for whip the post coelho is vacating because of his 
own ethics controversy reps william gray dpa david bonior 
dmich and beryl anthony dark are seeking that post

congressional investigators said wednesday that 
the air force is relying on outside consultants rather than its own 
personnel to determine the cost of the 68 billion system of 
railgarrison mx missiles 
officials from the general accounting office an investigating 
arm of congress told a house panel that the army navy and air 
force use consultants for a wide range of services 
the total number however is likely higher than the agency found 
because the definition of consultant varies and many contractors do 
not report whether consultants worked on certain programs 
investigators said 
the house armed services subcommittee on investigations 
responding to last summers operation ill wind investigation of 
military purchasing fraud had asked the agency to look into the 
pentagons use of consultants 
the gao studied one weapon system from each of the three services 
the armys 32 billion fiber optic guided missile program the 
navys v22 osprey a 26 billion tiltrotor aircraft program and 
the air forces system to deploy the landbased nuclear mx missile 
on railroad cars 
the ballistic systems division which manages the mx program 
awarded 15 contracts worth about 99 million for support services 
during fiscal 1987 and 1988 said harold j johnson director of 
manpower issues in the gao national security and international 
affairs division 
the support contractors provided cost estimates reviews of 
contractor logistic support plans and helped determine system and 
component specifications 
the gao report prompted rep nicholas mavroules dmass 
chairman of the subcommittee to question who estimates the cost of 
the mx railgarrison the air force or the consultants hired by the 
service 
the best we can tell its the consultants that they have hired 
do the estimating the air force reviews and approves johnson 
said 
who are the experts the consultants or the people we have in 
the air force mavroules said 
johnson said the air force has told the agency that the 
contractor in this case has the institutional memory and the 
expertise 
the massachusetts democrat also expressed dismay over the 
pentagons inability to keep track of the consultants the absence 
of a specific definition of the term consultant and the possibility 
that these problems could result in incidents of 
conflictofinterest 
allan burman deputy administrator and acting administrator in 
the office of federal procurement policy said his agency has come 
up with a policy letter on conflictofinterest that will require a 
60day comment period 
nevertheless mavroules was angered by the absence of a tracking 
system for consultants 
what in gods name is so difficult why is this a hot potato 
that when we ask the question we cannot get an answer is the 
bureaucracy that great mavroules said his voice rising 
you categorize you prioritize you have certain numbers of 
people working for the government you have a defense industry 
youre in touch with everyday dont they have an obligation to give 
to you the proper information with regard to that question i want 
to know i have a right to know the american people have a right to 
know why cant i get that from you the congressman said 
burman said that with the number of broad categories it is 
difficult for consultants looking at those categories to determine 
whether they are part of the process 
its very difficult for us to get any kind of consistency he 
said 
col john p wilhelm acting director of the defense departments 
advisory and assistance services for the past two years told 
mavroules that there is no incentive to report this information 
because what happens if they dont report it

president bush said wednesday he will nominate 
michael r deland regional administrator in boston for the 
environmental protection agency as chairman of the presidents 
council on environmental quality 
the selection of deland a 47yearold lawyer who has gained a 
reputation as a strong enforcer of environmental laws brought 
praise from several environmental groups 
the threemember council was established in 1970 to advise the 
president on environmental matters and has few statutory powers one 
of the reagan administraions first acts was a drastic cut in the 
councils staff and the council did little in the eight years of 
the reagan administration 
mike deland is a first rate environmentalist and i think hes 
an outstanding choice said jay hair head of the national 
wildlife federation the bigger question is whether or not the 
president will give him both the resources and the respect in order 
to revitalize rebuild and redirect the ceq 
deland has been mentioned as a possible republican gubernatorial 
candidate in massachusetts and was considered a leading candidate 
for the job of epa administrator earlier this year 
since his appointment in boston in 1983 he has found himself at 
odds with epa headquarters several times for his aggressive 
proenvironmental positions notably on the question of whether it 
would be safe to drill for oil and gas off the new england coast 
during last years presidential race deland added fuel to the 
bush campaigns attack on democratic opponent michael dukakis for 
failing as massachusetts governor to clean up boston harbor but 
while deland criticized dukakis for delaying the cleanup he 
acknowleged that epa under the republican administration also shared 
the blame when bush took reporters on a boatride through the 
polluted harbor deland refused to go along 
in another clash with the dukakis state administration deland 
blocked the development of a shopping mall in attleboro mass 
arguing the complex would destroy environmentally important wetlands 
deland also clashed with then new hampshire gov john sununu now 
white house chief of staff over a proposed development on that 
states loon mountain 
since then deland has supported a proposed moratorium on new 
development on cape cod 
deland is a very strong environmentalist whose selection is 
very much a positive step said david gardiner of the sierra 
clubs washington office 
gardiner and other environmenalists said it was too early to tell 
whether the council which wielded considerable clout in the late 
1970s under president carter would regain influence 
i assume he deland would not have taken the job if he had not 
had some assurances of what the ceqs authority would be said 
gardiner the councils influence largely will be a question of 
staffing and money he added 
deland is a graduate of harvard college and boston colege law 
school he worked for the president of the university of 
massachusetts on the epas legal staff and as a private consultant 
before being named regional administrator for epa unsuccessful back 
surgery several years ago forces him to rely on a wheelchair most of 
the time 
the president has not announced his choices for the other two 
council positions

premier nikolai i ryzhkov said wednesday the 
government will make huge cuts in military spending spur the 
economy and provide help for the nearly 40 million soviet citizens 
who live in poverty 
he also said the war in afghanistan cost the treasury the 
equivalent of 8 billion a year the red army was involved in the 
war for nine years and completed its withdrawal feb 15 
speaking to the congress of peoples deputies after being 
reappointed premier by the smaller supreme soviet legislature 
ryzhkov said the government would reduce defense spending by 33 
percent to 50 percent by 1995 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the congress last week the 
soviet union spends 773 billion rubles on defense the equivalent 
of 118 billion a year at the official exchange rate that is almost 
four times the amount previously acknowledged 
ryzhkov premier since september 1985 gave the first public 
breakdown of that spending 
he said the equivalent of 497 billion is earmarked for arms and 
equipment purchases 234 billion for research and development 
308 billion for maintenance of the army and navy 7 billion for 
development of the armed forces 35 billion for pensions and 35 
billion for other needs 
ryzhkov also promised pensions would be increased next year for 
20 million retirees with the new minimum pension raised to 70 
rubles the equivalent of 107 a month some retirees now barely 
survive on as little as 30 rubles 45 a month 
the government is aware that almost 40 million people are now 
living below the poverty line ryzhkov said which he defined as 
an income of 75 rubles the equivalent of 114 a month or less 
explaining why the economic crisis seems to have worsened during 
his fouryear tenure he said that among many other factors the 
chernobyl nuclear accident cost the country 8 billion rubles and the 
soviets 8year involvement in afghanistan 5 billion rubles yearly 
the equivalent of 8 billion 
he told deputies the iceberg of colossal problems and 
difficulties gorbachev inherited in 1985 could not be melted in 
four years even by the most active restructuring 
ryzhkov said social reform also would include abolition of 
special medical care for privileged officials including the 
celebrated health ministrys chief fourth directorate that provides 
service to top party and government figures 
earlier ryzhkov was bombarded with questions for more than two 
hours as soviet lawmakers took advantage of their newly won right to 
call kremlin leaders to account for the countrys economic and 
environmental woes 
before political reforms championed by gorbachev went into effect 
last fall the old supreme soviet legislature was a rubberstamp 
body that meekly listened to speeches by top state and communist 
party officials and ratified any measure put before it 
but lawmakers grilled ryzhkov on issues ranging from consumer 
goods shortages to the state bureaucracy in charge of the 
chronically ailing farm sector 
in other legislative action wednesday gorbachev rejected an 
attempt by several lawmakers to name maverick communist leader boris 
n yeltsin head of a government watchdog agency in place of 
gorbachevs own choice 
gorbachev had proposed gennady a kolbin party chief of the 
central asian republic of kazakhstan to head the peoples control 
committee which oversees government planning and spending but a 
parade of supreme soviet deputies took the floor to propose yeltsin 
for the job 
they praised yeltsins reputation for independence and battling 
corruption which they said made him better suited for the post 
gorbachev however insisted on his constitutional right to name 
his own candidate subject to the legislatures consent 
after permitting more than an hour of debate gorbachev moved to 
cut off further discussion and forced a vote that resulted in 
overwhelming confirmation of kolbin 
gorbachev told the session earlier he and yeltsin had already 
discussed yeltsins role in the supreme soviet and settled upon the 
chairmanship of an important committee on construction and 
architecture 
in the questionandanswer session before the vote on ryzhkov 
siberian deputy yuri komarov commented that gosagroprom an 
agricultural superministry created at the start of gorbachevs 
reforms and abolished in march worked so inefficiently that 
people were saying it was the most successful action by the cia 
against the soviet economy 
deputy anatoly miloserdny of byelorussia blamed the council of 
ministers that ryzhkov heads for shortsightedness that he said led 
to the disappearance from sale of the most basic consumer goods 
ryzhkov conceded some specific mistakes that had a negative 
effect on the economy 
ryzhkov was elevated to the politburo shortly after gorbachev 
came to power in march 1985 and captured public attention last 
december when he headed a politburo commission overseeing relief 
efforts for victims of armenias earthquake 
more recently ryzhkov has come under criticism from some 
deputies who blame him for the countrys environmental problems 
deputy alexei yablokov a biologist elected to the congress by 
moscowbased research institutes called ryzhkov an ecological 
illiterate at a news conference last month 
in other business wednesday the supreme soviet chose yevgeny 
smolentsev head of the supreme court of the russian federation as 
chairman of the soviet supreme court and reappointed alexander 
sukharev general prosecutor

fight

suleiman bamilat who also was convicted in the firebomb attacks

a cabinet minister on wednesday reproached 
three men who plan to pursue suits against the state for wrongful 
confinement and torture after being detained for more than a year 
without trial or charge 
foreign affairs minister robert ouko said that david mukara 
nganga a former lecturer in political science at the university 
of nairobi and lawyers wanyiri kihoro and kariuki mirugi failed to 
appreciate the pardons granted them by president daniel arap moi 
defiance is not the way to respond to magnanimity ouko said 
they should abandon those intentions and express gratitude to the 
president 
the three were among seven detainees freed june 1 and june 6 moi 
said no more political prisoners remained in kenyan jails a 
contention disputed by amnesty international the londonbased human 
rights organization 
amnesty says at least 60 political prisoners are still held 
following court convictions based on tainted confessions 
the four others freed were raila odinga son of former vice 
president oginga odinga business executive israel otieno agina 
richard obuon guya a former air force private and samuel okumu 
okwany who was implicated in a trial of people charged with seeking 
guerrila warfare training in libya

on clandestine groups allegedly plotting mois overthrow they were 
imprisoned under the preservation of public order and security act 
which permits indefinite confinement without trial or charge 
kihoro nganga and mirugi first filed suits against the state 
in 1987 and 1988 alleging torture and challenging their detention 
their lawyer gibson kamau kuria was arrested the day after he 
filed the 1987 suits and spent eight months in detention kuria told

feuding democrats and republicans reached 
agreement wednesday to clear the way for a committee vote on the 
controversial nomination of donald gregg to be ambassador to south 
korea a key participant said 
sen mitch mcconnell rky said sen alan cranston dcalif 
who has spurred an investigation by the senate foreign relations 
committee into greggs alleged links to the irancontra affair 
agreed to schedule a vote for june 20 if the bush administration 
produces all requested documents and information by june 16 
as a result mcconnell said he is calling off a oneday 
republican boycott of committee meetings thus permitting the panel 
to act on this and other key nominations as well as a pending 25 
billion state department authorization bill 
if the administration doesnt produce the documents obviously 
the deal would be off mcconnell said 
but he said state department officials who were present at his 
meeting with cranston promised that the material would be produced 
by the deadline 
mcconnell said he obtained a written agreement that the vote on 
gregg will be held even if cranston is not satisfied with the 
materials he recieves 
if he isnt satisfied then he can use that as an argument to 
vote against the nomination mcconnell said but there still 
will be a vote 
cranston meanwhile will question gregg under oath for a second 
time at a hearing to be held on june 15 
cranston and other senators are suspicious of greggs contacts 
with former national security council official oliver l north and 
other irancontra figures in 1985 when gregg served as bushs vice 
presidemntial national security adviser 
the questions central to the investigation are 
did gregg help north illegally resupply the nicaraguan contra 
rebels with military aid 
is he lying about it now 
gregg maintains he had no role in supplying the contras and that 
he is telling the truth about what he did and did not do he has 
said he wants to use the hearings to clear the air and remove all 
suspicions about his conduct 
mcconnell said he led the republican boycott of the committee on 
wednesday to prevent committee action on nominations and legislation 
because he feared gregg was being railroaded 
this nomination has been up here since early march and ive 
told sen cranston that i thought they were trying to kill the 
nomination with delays mcconnell said what i was unwilling to 
see continue was the effort to kill the nomination with delays and 
leaks 
mcconnell said he is optimistic that the gregg nomination can 
still be approved 
but i think this has been made into a partisan matter so well 
have to wait and see he said 
the end of the gop boycott apparently will permit votes thursday 
morning on the state department bill and nominations of bernard 
aronson to be assistant secretary of state for latin american 
affairs john kelly to be assistant secretary of state for middle 
eastern and south asian affairs and former sen chic hecht rnev 
to be ambassador to the bahamas

adult barn swallows and cliff swallows 
swooped and screeched wednesday as two biologists carefully removed 
seven newborn birds and about 120 eggs from nests under two bridges 
scheduled for demolition 
the birds and eggs found in about 60 nests had to be removed 
under provisions of the us migratory bird act before the bridges 
could be torn down said state department of transportation 
spokeswoman cheryl plathe 
the two species are extremely abundant birds but are covered 
under the act as are all migratory birds said carrol henderson of 
the state department of natural resources 
were doing this to fulfill the federal requirements said 
plathe we hope we dont have to do this to every bridge in the 
future 
as the nests were demolished the adult birds flew around the 
area frantically 
they dont like their homes being torn down but its something 
we have to do to give the public a better ride said bill langston 
of the transportation department 
the 26 million road project includes two new wider bridges and 
repaving of about seven miles of state highway 22 about 60 miles 
west of minneapolis near hutchinson 
construction engineers watched as the biologists working as 
volunteers removed eggs and bird babies before tearing the nests 
from the underside of the steel bridges over the crow river and 
scraping remaining mud and straw from the bridge 
the babies and eggs were taken to the university of minnesotas 
wildlife rehabilitation clinic in st paul for nursing and 
incubation 
however the chance of survival for the newborns was slim as was 
the chance the eggs would hatch after being disturbed said linda 
wolf a clinic biologist who helped in the removal 
if we get 10 healthy hatches out of the eggs id be 
surprised wolf said 
the baby birds each only about an inch long and not yet 
feathered will require feeding by hand every 20 minutes from dawn 
to dusk by volunteers using tiny syringes wolf said 
while efforts are being made to save their young the adult 
swallows will be looking for a place to build new nests and should 
lay another set of eggs in two to three weeks wolf said 
swallows can build new nests in about three days plathe said so 
contractors will have to knock any new nests from the bridges until 
theyre torn down one bridge was scheduled for demolition thursday 
the other in two weeks 
in the future we have to determine how to keep birds from 
nesting under bridges plathe said 
we should have been out here this spring and hosed them off 
before they laid their eggs but we didnt and theyre here so 
thats why were doing this she said

surgery eased abdominal pain and a persistent 
fever plaguing ferdinand marcos but the ousted philippine president 
remained in very critical condition wednesday a hospital spokesman 
said 
its not like this was the only source and now the infection is 
gone but there was some response to the treatment and the pain and 
the fever appears to have decreased said eugene tiwanak a st 
francis medical center administrator 
marcos 71 underwent three hours of emergency exploratory 
surgery tuesday in which doctors drained a pancreatic abscess 
considered a source of a bacterial infection complicating treatment 
of his widespread organ failure 
marcos suffered cardiac kidney and pulmonary failure may 18 and 
since has been in very critical and unstable condition the pancreas 
helps break down food and produces hormones necessary to regulate 
the bodys metabolism 
the exiled leader remained on lifesupport equipment wednesday 
including a respirator to regulate his breathing tiwanak said 
adding that marcos also undergoes hemodialysis four times a week to 
cleanse his body of wastes 
his medical team has been instructed to take any measure to keep 
marcos alive aides said the ousted leaders mind remains clear and 
that he makes his own decisions 
just because he cant talk he cant breathe doesnt mean he 
cant think said adviser arturo aruiza adding that marcos agreed 
to the surgery 
tiwanak said no further surgery was planned and doctors had not 
determined whether the abscess was a major source of the infection 
marcos has lived in exile in honolulu since a popular revolt 
catapulted corazon aquino to the philippine presidency three years 
ago 
aquino widow of assassinated marcos foe benigno aquino has 
repeatedly denied the pleas of marcos and his wife imelda to 
return home 
both marcoses are under us indictment for allegedly stealing 
more than 100 million from the philippine treasury and stashing it 
in the united states 
however a federal judge severed marcos from the case meaning he 
will not be prosecuted unless he recovers and no trial date has 
been set for mrs marcos who pleaded innocent to the charges and is 
free on 5 million bail 
marcos has been hospitalized since jan 15 and doctors said it 
was a miracle he has survived so long

the senate passed legislation on wednesday 
speeding 33 billion to veterans programs and a host of moneyshort 
federal agencies setting up potentially difficult talks with a 
house that passed a different version of the bill 
senators approved the bill on a voice vote on the fourth day of 
debate 
final passage came after lawmakers refused to delay for one year 
much of the new medicare catastrophic health care program for the 
elderly the bill now goes to a conference committee with the house 
which passed its version last month to iron out differences before 
the bill goes to the president 
sen john mccain rariz had led a fight to postpone parts of 
the program including a surtax on senior citizens that has drawn 
complaints because of its cost 
his effort was defeated 5149 on a procedural vote in which he 
was opposed by leaders of both parties 
lawmakers however did adopt by voice a nonbinding provision 
offered by the leaders calling on congress to consider making 
changes in the catastrophic care program in future legislation 
there is widespread agreement that the surtax will likely collect 
more money than expected but disputes remain over whittling down 
the levy 
certainly most americans would rather not have to pay anything 
and receive the benefits said senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan thats the american way but were broke 
earlier across the capitol four house members of both parties 
joined members of veterans associations at a news conference to 
accuse the senate of delaying the legislation while senators attach 
pet projects to it the house approved the veterans money 12 
billion on may 24 
massachusetts rep silvio conte ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee said the senate was holding the veterans 
funds hostage to the pet projects of senators who have included 
the veterans money in a christmas tree of nonemergency 
appropriations 
chairman gv sonny montgomery dmiss of the house veterans 
affairs committee complained that because of the delay the 
department of veterans affairs was already gearing down some of 
its operations 
weve never hollered wolf about this situation at all he 
said 
the spending bill which president bush first proposed as a 22 
billion measure in march contains money for health care 
compensation increases and other programs for veterans 
for want of the money the veterans agency has begun limiting 
outpatient care in lessserious cases delayed opening new 
facilities and halted many maintenance proects and equipment 
purchases the department annually treats around 35 million of the 
nations 27 million veterans 
mccains amendment offered tuesday would delay for a year the 
surtax people over age 65 must pay to help finance the catastrophic 
care program it would also postpone other important parts of the 
program including caps it places on senior citizens doctors bills 
and a prescription drug benefit 
democrats had countered with an alternative calling for changes 
to be considered in future legislation 
the overall measure also contains 892 million for student loans 
100 million to help refugees move to this country and finances for 
fighting forest fires united nations peacekeeping unemployment 
benefits foster care and other programs 
the legislation has picked up a batch of amendments in the 
senate including several of interest to particular lawmakers 
one addition would protect a school district in sumter county 
sc from sacrificing about 700000 in federal aid this year it 
would otherwise have to yield because of a loss of students covered 
by an assistance program the clause was sponsored by sen ernest 
hollings dsc an appropriations committee member 
the bill also contains 75 million to repair a radio telescope in 
the home state of senate appropriations committee chairman robert 
byrd dwva orders the army to spend 50 million to buy 
coldweather clothing made in 10 states and sets aside 400000 to 
study last years fires in yellowstone national park 
the house also added its own favorite provisions to the bill 
these include language easing the way for alton ill to lease 
land on which it could build a public marina allowing a 25 
million increase in spending for cotton and tobacco grading and 
providing up to 360000 for aviation research at the university of 
minnesota 
the house bill also contains 822 million not in the senate 
measure for antidrug programs

two congressmen vying to succeed gov thomas 
h kean started hitting the campaign trail and each other wednesday 
only hours after their primary victories 
democrat james florio a winner by 27000 votes was at commuter 
train station by 730 am and talking to more than 1000 senior 
citizens by lunch time nearly eight years ago he lost to kean by 
the narrowest margin in state history 1797 votes out of 23 
million cast 
republican james courter used the day to appear with kean whos 
still very popular among voters and is considered an important 
political ally even though he differs with courter on key issues 
kean barred by law from seeking a third consecutive term 
endorsed no primary candidate but filmed commercials for the 
frontrunners that aired in a media blitz during the final weeks of 
the primary 
also decided in new jersey on tuesday was a bitter primary for 
the democratic mayoral nomination in plainfield where city 
councilman harold mitchell upset mayor richard l taylor by a 
198vote margin 2172 to 1974 
taylor elected mayor in 1985 and mitchell a 7year councilman 
head two factions of the citys democratic party for years their 
primary fight this year was the most public show of animosity 
between the two popular politicians 
at one point both submitted to urine tests to fend off 
allegations that they consorted with drug dealers 
courter a conservative who comes from a wealthy family and the 
republicanrich northwestern part of the state is expert on foreign 
affairs and gained national attention as a member of the irancontra 
committee 
florio the son of a brooklyn shipyard worker has a formidable 
political base in southern new jersey and a national reputation as 
an environmentalist 
courter said florio has amassed a big spending voting record 
in washington and established himself as the head of machine 
politics in camden 
courter also backed away from his no new taxes primary 
campaign platform and said if he ever had to raise taxes it would 
be only as a last resort but he would bend over backwards to 
avoid a tax increase 
florio picked up a favorite theme of courters republican primary 
opponents and condemned courters freemarket plan to lower 
insurance rates by deregulating the industry 
while saying political labels serve no purpose florio termed 
courters call for deregulation so politically conservative it was 
off the charts of reasonability 
both candidates promised to spell out where they differ from one 
another and said voters will have some clear choices

the senate narrowly rejected a proposal 
wednesday to delay the start of major provisions of medicares new 
catastrophic health care coverage a proposal opponents argued would 
have effectively killed the new benefits 
reacting to criticism from senior citizens opposed to paying an 
income tax surcharge to help pay for the program backers of the 
delay proposal argued that it was unfair to put roughly twothirds 
of the cost of the program on roughly onethird of retired americans 
with enough income to make them subject to income taxes 
those who voted against delaying the coverage maintained that 
huge federal budget deficits make it impossible to provide new 
benefits without providing a way to pay for them and that middleand 
upperincome retired americans should foot a major share of the cost 
the surtax could be as much as 800 a year for medicareeligible 
retirees in upper income ranges 
in the key vote the senate voted 5149 against an attempt by 
sen john mccain rariz to kill an amendment by senate majority 
leader george mitchell of maine that called on the finance committee 
to review the program while benefits continue on schedule mitchell 
introduced his amendment as a substitute to mccains proposal to 
delay provisions while a way to reduce the surtax is found 
the senate then quickly adopted by voice votes the mitchell 
substitute amendment and attached it to a pending supplemental 
appropriations measure to pump 33 billion additional money into a 
variety of federal programs for the current fiscal year 
nowhere in my amendment will you find the word repeal but you 
will find the word delay mccain maintained he termed the 
mitchell amendment a smokescreen that would not require finance 
committee action and vowed to continue his fight to in order delay 
in implementation of the surtax 
sen dave durenberger rminn argued that approving mccains 
delay of some benefits would amount to repeal because it would send 
a clear signal to the finance committee to let the program languish 
were going to get wisdom real quick and there is no way youre 
going to get this back out of that committee said durenberger a 
member of the panel that crafted the catastrophic health act 
the measure cleared the senate last summer on an 8611 vote and 
with similarly overwhelming house approval was signed into law with 
great fanfare by president ronald reagan who had proposed a more 
modest and less expensive version 
mccain was one of the 11 senators opposing the catastrophic 
health measure last year 
opponents of the mccain attempt argued that an estimated 59 
percent of the 32 million medicare beneficaries do not have enough 
income to qualify for income tax and would pay only 4 a month for 
the additional coverage 
they cited congressional budget office estimates that 70 percent 
of those eligible for medicare would pay 100 or less a year in 
additional surtaxes and that only 56 percent in upper income levels 
would pay the maximum 800 tax 
the catastrophic coverage took effect jan 1 with unlimited 
hospitalization coverage after a onceayear 560 deductible 
however a 1370 cap on outofpocket doctor bills does not kick in 
until next year and a new prescription drug benefit begins a 
threeyear phasein period in 1991 
it was those benefits beginning next january that mccain wanted 
to delay along with the surtax or supplemental premium to 
finance them the surtax started this year to build up a trust fund 
to pay the new benefits without dipping into the federal treasury

bags of money fell out of an armored car on 
a busy highway during rush hour wednesday and traffic backed up 
almost a halfmile when motorists stopped and scrambled for the 
cash police said 
this is an education in greed in people police officer 
roberto campos said people were just stopping their cars and 
getting out and grabbing money 
police caught at least two people who allegedly took money from 
the loomis armored inc truck and have license number of others 
loomis officials did not take phone calls wednesday and it was 
not known how much money was in the truck and how much was lost 
the money spilled out of the back of a loomis truck on interstate 
10 just east of downtown said campos who was first on the scene 
police said some drivers tossed bags of money into their cars 
while others scooped up loose bills that littered the fourlane 
highway 
with the turbulence of the traffic the money was flying in the 
air like a toyota commercial police shift supervisor hank 
dimatteo said who added that at least 20 motorists stopped to grab 
some cash 
campos and his partner ed porterfield were working undercover 
in an unmarked car when they happened upon the accident and saw two 
men get out of a pickup and stuff wads of money in their pockets and 
pants 
the two men hopped back in their pickup and drove off but the 
two plainclothes officers were in pursuit when the men were pulled 
over police found 3840 on them the pair had not been formally 
charged as of wednesday afternoon 
they didnt know they were being followed campos said it 
kind of ruined their day from the happiest to im going to 
jail 
other people were thought to have gotten away with money bags 
campos said adding that police had license numbers of some he said 
anyone caught taking money would be charged with felony theft if 
they did not return the cash 
the halfmile traffic jam dispersed quickly after police arrived 
he said 
for the next hour or so police and fire officials collected 
8800 in stray currency mostly 20 bills from the roadside 
they found a bag containing 800 in 20 bills in a storm drain 
in october 1987 about 200 people converged on interstate 71 near 
downtown columbus ohio after the rear door of a metropolitan 
armored car inc truck swung open bags of cash fell onto the 
highway and at least one ripped open 
the columbus dispatch quoted sources as saying more than 1 
million was lost but one man turned in nearly 57000 saying he 
considered keeping the money but could not in good conscience 
metropolitan gave him a reward of 10 percent of the amount returned

mens colony here is still a danger to society a board of prison 
terms panel ruled in refusing the inmates 10th plea for a parole 
date 
the panels vote was 21 deputy commissioner anthony smith 
argued that a date should be set but far enough in the future to 
exceed the prisoners life span 
the board turned aside a lengthy apology from schoenfeld who 
said i ask that you at least set a date so i can see a light at 
the end of the tunnel 
he was convicted for his role in the kidnapping and abduction of 
26 schoolchildren and their driver from the rural town of chowchilla 
in californias central valley for 5 million ransom 
schoenfeld his brother james and frederick n woods

through the wood and earthcovered hole

doonesbury cartoonist garry trudeau 
withdrew a week of his comic strips after his gentle lampoon of the 
student protests for democracy turned tragic with the beijing 
massacres 
all last week the strip was set in beijings tiananmen square 
where students had been protesting since april 
this week trudeau zeroed in on the controversy over the recently 
published diary of the late artist andy warhol but he had planned 
to take his characters back to china next week 
then everything intensified over the weekend so we killed that 
week said lee salem editorial director of the kansas citybased 
universal press syndicate which distributes the strip the whole 
situation blew up 
salem said another week of strips on the china theme for use 
starting june 12 had been sent to newspapers last friday when the 
weekends events in which hundreds were killed made the cartoons 
inappropriate 
salem said the substitute strips sent out sunday provide kind 
of an obtuse look at the alaska oil spill 
trudeau told new york newsday that the premise of the substitute 
strips is that the artist tips an ink bottle on a whole weeks 
worth of strips 
he told the newspaper that the second week of strips on china was 
predicated on a peaceful resolution 
that was a very bad miscalculation and now obviously 
inappropriate he said

hungary became the first soviet bloc nation to 
denounce the crackdown in china and taiwan said wednesday it will 
end a 40year ban on mail and telephone links with the mainland to 
help spread reports of the bloodbath 
hungarian communist party chief karoly grosz said the military 
attack on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing last weekend had 
shocked his nation 
events in china have had special repercussions in hungary where 
many remember the soviet militarys violent suppression of the 1956 
revolt 
hundreds and possibly thousands died when chinese troops moved 
into beijing to crush the student movement 
grosz said in a statement issued by the official news agency mti 
the tragedy in china has shocked hungarian socialist workers 
party members and hungarian society as a whole 
i firmly declare that we deeply condemn violence and 
fratricidal war these methods have nothing to do with socialism 
later several thousand young people including chinese students 
staged a peaceful demonstration outside the chinese embassy and gave 
a petition the embassys first secretary promised to pass to beijing 
polands opposition said more than 2000 people in the southern 
city of krakow demonstrated wednesday against the chinese crackdown 
and demanded a clear condemnation from the communist authorities on 
tuesday official spokesman zbyslaw rykowksi said the government 
felt deep concern 
in taipei taiwan communications minister chang chienpang said 
telephone service to 80 cities on the mainland will begin saturday 
through a switching center in hong kong and mail service will start 
in a week 
chang said this will not change taiwans policy of refusing to 
have any official contacts with the mainland government because the 
telecommunication and postal administrations of the rival 
governments will not be directly linked 
the nationalists in taiwan were defeated in a civil war in china 
in 1949 but continue to claim they are the legitimate government of 
all china the nationalists and communists are technically still at 
war 
also on wednesday the taiwan governmentrun broadcasting corp 
of china began a 24hour news broadcast to china on shortwave 
channels the station also established a hot line to receive 
telephone calls from chinese listeners 
in miaoli 75 miles southwest of taipei about 10000 people held 
a rally and condemned the mainland government for the killings in 
beijing 
in an interview by the masscirculation bild newspaper of 
hamburg west germany chancellor helmut kohl suggested the ideology 
governing china and other socialist nations is dying 
the call for freedom cannot be smashed forever under the weight 
of tanks kohl said those in power must sooner or later 
recognize that economic progress cannot be achieved without human 
rights 
dieter vogel a spokesman for the west german economics ministry 
said economic assistance will definitely be affected if it is 
determined that the reforms are dead 
vogel said west german companies in china may also take a hard 
look at future investment policies 
a west german relief agency suspended new projects in china to 
protest the chinese governments decision to use force to quell the 
popular protests 
japans foreign ministry had announced it halted aid projects and 
postponed official visits but said wednesday this resulted from the 
chaos in china and did not reflect a policy decision 
japan is the largest contributor of aid to china assistance 
most in the form of loans totaled 61 billion as of 1987 the 
latest figures available 
tokyos reluctance to criticize china mainly stems from its 
unwillingness to antagonize its neighbors who still harbor 
resentment against japan for its actions during world war ii 
soldiers in beijing fired in a diplomatic compound on wednesday 
and the state department ordered the evacuation of all diplomatic 
dependents and nonessential personnel it also urged all other 
americans in the country to leave immediately 
theres been no communication from the leadership theres no 
indication who the leadership is said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
us officials have mounted a wideranging effort using spy 
satellites embassy intelligence and interviews with americans 
leaving china in an attempt to determine what is going on in the 
strifetorn nation 
in seoul south korea about 1000 chinese students chanting 
democracy burned effigies of chinese communist leaders many 
carried taiwanese flags and placards that read sword shall perish 
by sword 
about 350 chinese and filipinos marched to a chinese consular 
office in manila where they laid wreaths and called for the 
downfall of chinese premier li peng 
in england about 1000 students marched in oxford 50 miles 
northwest of london the oxford university students union said it 
was sending 1000 postcards to prime minister margaret thatcher 
calling for the withdrawal of britains ambassador from beijing and 
trade sanctions against china 
in hong kong crowds of chinese residents protested in trucks 
taxis and marches shouting for the resignation of chinese leaders 
officials said the crowd could have been larger if organized rallies 
had not been canceled after a riot during the night when a mob 
tried to storm branches of mainland chinese banks 
organizers feared their rallies might trigger further violence 
and urged demonstrators to remain at home or pray at churches for 
the beijing victims police said they had no estimate on the number 
of protesters but noted they were usually six abreast and stretched 
down several streets

a man set free his four imported 3inchlong 
hissing cockroaches in this semitropical city because he was afraid 
the state might jail him and destroy his beloved bugs a pet store 
owner said wednesday 
the state department of agriculture last week ordered the critter 
shop to stop selling the madagascar hissing roaches fearing if they 
got free they might breed and spread across the south like the 
flying asian cockroach 
harold denmark chief of entomology in the departments division 
of plant industries said hes concerned about the effect on 
floridas lucrative tourist industry if the hissing insects multiply 
the man who bought the four insects in january said he freed 
the roaches in his back yard said critter shop manager chloe riley 
he came in and said man i was scared i let them loose i 
was afraid theyd put me in jail ms riley said he said he 
didnt want the department of agriculture to hurt them 
she would not identify the man and said she wouldnt tell the 
agriculture department the mans name either not me ms riley 
said ive got to live in this end of town 
agricultural agents have said they dont know much about the 
roaches which are bred by some zoos and distributed by wholesalers 
as food for certain reptiles 
the critter shop got a shipment of 12 of the insects in january 
and sold six of the roaches in the first four months and the rest 
in just two days after reports the bugs were trendy cheap to feed 
and easy to maintain 
now that they say these are a bad thing everybody wants to buy 
them ms riley said somebody came in today wanting some 
most researchers believe the roaches do not reproduce easily but 
floridas warm wet climate might be attractive to the species 
which is at home in tropical and subtropical environments denmark 
said 
attorney william smalley a longtime customer of the shop has 
offered to help fight the stopsale order which the state said 
applied only to the critter shop because its the only store known 
to be selling the roaches 
smalley said hes checking the orders legality and so far has 
found that no one knows what to about it 
he believes the plant industries division may be out of its 
jurisdiction saying the order cites a plant industry rule and 
refers to nursery stock but this roach is not a plant smalley 
said

terrence mcnallys the lisbon traviata which 
opened tuesday at offbroadways manhattan theater club is more 
than a play about obsession it is two very different plays about 
obsession 
the first act is a blithe bitchy look at one fans extreme 
fascination with opera the second a melodramatic and deadly 
examination of a gay love affair gone wrong the two dont tie 
together neatly but they make for some compelling often 
entertaining and even unnerving theater 
mcnally author of frankie and johnny in the clair de lune 
excels at the knowing putdown the slightly sour but funny 
observation in the past he has skewered new york theater people in 
its only a play 
in the lisbon traviata he dissects opera buffs specifically 
the homosexual fans who idolized certain female stars these are the 
men who call singers only by their first names who have 
encyclopedic knowledge of opera trivia and who buy every recording 
made by their heroines 
mendy nathan lane is one such true believer a worshipper of 
maria callas he learns his good friend stephen anthony heald has 
purchased a pirated recording of callas 1958 performance of la 
traviata in lisbon 
much of act 1 deals with mendys attempts to obtain a copy of the 
record in between the pleading and cajoling the two men dish and 
then demolish just about every diva around from marilyn horne to 
beverly sills to joan sutherland their comments are mean unfair 
and funny 
yet there is a sadness almost a desperation underlying the 
revelry 
opera doesnt reject me mendy sighs the real world does 
wearing a tootight bathrobe lane flounces around an overdone 
manhattan apartment designed by philipp jung to look like the 
outside of a box of valentine candy lanes is a jokefilled role 
guaranteed to win audience sympathy but the actor never succumbs to 
buffonery or soap opera histrionics he finds both the humor and the 
humiliation in the character 
stephen is more enigmatic and not very likable a trait that 
doesnt really become apparent until the second act by then the 
locale has switched to stephens apartment a stark sparse living 
space filled with expensive stereo equipment and scores of neatly 
shelved records and cds 
and the comedy has disappeared in favor of melodrama involving 
stephen his lover michael and michaels new boyfriend the plot 
takes on aspects of grand opera as stephen forces the play to a 
tragic conclusion 
the playwright has improved the play since its last incarnation 
at a small offoffbroadway theater four years ago mcnally has 
enriched the second act giving michael a strong speech explaining 
why he is leaving stephen 
heald turns in a riveting performance as stephen whose fondness 
for opera colors his reallife relationships dan butler is fine as 
the disgruntled lover he forcefully articulates what is wrong when 
someone only focuses on what he likes 
from the comedy in act 1 to the tragedy in act 2 director john 
tillinger keeps a firm hand on the proceedings the two acts may not 
mesh but they both point out that there are consequences when life 
tries to imitate art

construction unions and businesses have agreed 
to a plan that would keep heavy trucks from making deliveries during 
peak commuting hours to help reduce air pollution mayor tom bradley 
announced tuesday 
southern californias skies are among the nations most polluted 
because of surrounding mountains that trap the filth along with 
stagnant weather and industries that operate in the area 
the city agreed to exempt from its proposed traffic management 
program trucks and equipment necessary for pouring concrete laying 
hot asphalt and erecting structural steel bradley said 
in return the construction industry agreed to shift its work 
hours without premium pay to 6 am to 3 pm instead of the 
current 7 am to 4 pm to reduce truck and automobile traffic 
bradley said 
the onehour shift would remove about 125000 construction 
workers from city streets during morning and afternoon rushhour 
traffic the mayor said 
the proposal developed by the city jointly with a regional air 
quality control agency would require truck operators to pay a 
surcharge for a license allowing them to use city streets during 
rush hour it also would create a rapid deployment task force 
intended to quickly respond and clean up major accidents 
the altered work schedule would involve members of 83 union 
locals including boiler makers brick layers carpenters operating 
engineers teamsters general contractors pipe trade workers and 
painters 
the plan is expected to go before the city council early next 
month

why use a cudgel when a scalpel is called for 
in one form or another that question forever arises in 
discussions of federal reserve or monetary policy which involves 
decisions about the supply and cost of money in the economy 
most likely it will continue to arise for years to come the 
simple truth being that monetary officials are familiar with the 
cudgel a blunt instrument but havent yet acquired skill with the 
more refined scalpel 
as a consequence critics say the feds inevitable first 
reaction to signs of inflation is to slow the economy mainly by 
restricting the money supply and thereby raising interest rates 
it works just as a human being would falter under repeated blows 
to the head the economy eventually slows factories close 
unemployment rises and demand lessens no mystery there people just 
dont have the money to buy 
but the question remains why should the fed have to slow the 
whole economy rather than simply restraining the inflationary 
culprits because the instruments and skills dont seem to be 
available to it 
john wright an international investment adviser and frequent 
critic of fed policy claims that for years monetary policy failed 
to perceive the true causes of domestic inflation and needlessly 
bludgeoned the american economy 
he becomes particularly incensed at repeated federal reserve 
efforts to dampen the american economy because of a factor that 
should have been dealt with abroad the inflationary factor was 
eurodollars created by european banks 
in his view these dollars created whenever dollardenominated 
loans were made by foreign banks created a classic inflation 
scenario that of too many dollars chasing too few goods 
prices rose but not because of domestic demand but because 
foreign banks created dollars without any supervision or restraints 
by american authorities 
still he says the fed response to eurodollar inflation was to 
cudgel the american economy into repeated recessions 
a somewhat similar worry arises today inflation for the 12 
months ended in april was 51 percent up from 39 percent in the 
year before as measured by the consumer price index the suggestion 
is that of general inflation 
however over the same time the consumer price index inflation 
rate for all items less food and energy barely rose for the 12 
months ended in april 1988 it was 43 percent for the 12 months 
through april 1989 it was 46 percent 
exclude food and energy prices and the inflation rate is almost 
stable add them and you have a dangerous trend now however there 
are some indications that food and energy prices may have 
stabilized albeit at high levels 
last years drought largely was responsible for driving up food 
prices by 65 percent while there is no assurance the drought will 
not continue or resume those knowledgeable about weather conditions 
are optimistic 
last year energy prices rose 87 percent largely on the basis of 
reduced production by members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries this year there are some indications supplies 
will be larger than before 
fed watchers therefore are expressing optimism that fed policy 
wont grow harsher and even that the fed will ease up on the 
economy allowing interest rates to fall 
in short the belief is that the fed will try to use the scalpel 
instead of the familiar cudgel

often derided as a nice place to live but you 
wouldnt want to visit atlanta tries one more time next month to 
amuse conventioneers and capture its soul as underground atlanta 
opens for business again 
seven years after the lights went out ostensibly for good the 
entertainment and shopping playground beneath downtown is set to 
open thursday after a threeyear overhaul under the auspices of the 
rouse co the wizards of american urban reclamation 
in its prime underground atlanta was atlantas answer to the 
french quarter created in old storefronts that were the citys 
heart before a network of bridges over railroad tracks literally 
raised downtown one level 
underground had swinging dixieland loud rock n roll cool 
jazz fine eateries chic watering holes even a shop where 
segregationist restaurateurturnedgovernor lester maddox signed 
autographs and sold souvenirs 
underground opened in 1969 peaked in 1972 was struggling by 
1975 and was gone by 1982 it was eulogized as the victim of crime 
or a perception thereof derelicts subway construction ripoff 
merchants and changing times there were dozens of theories about 
what went wrong but seemingly no answers 
without it downtown atlanta has acquired the reputation of a 
ghost town after dark which has been an albatross around the neck 
of the citys thriving convention industry while conventioneers sit 
in gleaming downtown hotels real atlantans are miles away in the 
biracial citys largely white suburbs 
in 1985 the city signed the deal for a 142 million 
rerevitalization it turned to rouse the people responsible for 
bostons faneuil hall market place baltimores harborplace new 
yorks south street seaport among other projects 
were trying to create a town center for metropolitan atlanta 
back to the birthplace of atlanta said joseph g martin jr 
president of the underground atlanta development company we want 
it to be a place where visitors will come to find out about what 
atlanta has to offer but where also the hometown crowd can feel 
some sense of identity 
mayor andrew young sees the new underground as one of the most 
significant accomplishments of two terms in office this 
represents a new heart for atlanta it represents a gathering place 
for the entire metro area 
the new underground is on and around the original site on 
downtowns south side just blocks from the highrise hotel 
district its three times the size of the old underground visitors 
will find 22 restaurants and nightclubs and nearly 100 retailers 
while the emphasis on retailing marks a change for underground the 
entertainment focus is something new for rouse 
weve never done this strong an entertainment aspect to any of 
our urban places said william m coleman vice president and 
general manager of rouseatlanta the rouse affiliate created to run 
the project 
some of that is due to the name he said underground 
atlanta has probably the highest name recognition of any project 
weve ever touched and what underground atlanta was known for 
was entertainment 
rouse officials anticipate 10 million to 11 million visitors a 
year half of them outoftowners they say there are enough office 
workers and conventiongoers downtown to meet threefourths of 
undergrounds needs 
even so martin said the real test of whether the project 
succeeds is whether the project appeals to residents the 
obvious concern what a lot of people talk about around here is 
security 
thats because the old underground came to be regarded as 
dangerous 
dante stephensen whose dantes down the hatch jazz club and 
restaurant anchored the old underground said at its worst 
underground had a lower crime rate than lenox square a popular 
mall but downtown areas cant protect themselves from bad 
publicity 
clearly this time around underground must be perceived as safe 
weve taken a commonsense approach martin said a squad of 
some 30 private guards will patrol accompanied by atlanta police 
who are building a 34officer substation there planners have made 
sure there are no blind alleys and lighting designers have made it 
bright enough to read at midnight 
martin admits to being irked that he is repeatedly asked what 
underground will do to keep out undesirables first tell me 
who the undesirables are this is a town center its open to 
everyone if a person comes to underground and happens to look 
different thats fine if a person starts to infringe on somebody 
elses rights thats not fine 
a nononsense security policy seems to have wide public appeal 
where city officials triggered a storm of criticism with a plan to 
run vagrants out before last years democratic national convention 
hardly anything has been heard from anyone concerned about 
loiterers civil rights in underground 
i dont see it as a problem coleman said the biggest 
problem is in perception and that perception problem goes away as 
people come here and have a good time and find out they arent 
hassled 
i would be surprised martin said if underground is not 
the safest place in the whole atlanta area 
it had better be the city has sunk more than 80 million in 
revenue bonds as well as other public funding into underground if 
it flops the city could be forced to cough up some 3 million a 
year for 30 years 
underground is important symbolically and it is a test of 
whether a town center can work here whether we have enough 
cohesiveness martin said because if we continue to drift 
apart as weve been doing there could be all sorts of consequences 
economic political social and otherwise 
and although rouse has relatively little capital invested the 
companys track record is on the line it seems that each year 
the expectations get higher as they see whats happened in other 
cities coleman said 
rouse has taken slums and turned them into landmarks said 
stephenson who is reopening dantes and underground atlanta was 
never as bad at its worst as any of those other areas were 
project officials maintain theres virtually no way underground 
will fail 
im convinced underground is going to be a great success 
martin said pointing out that while two developers put together the 
first underground on a shoestring this time the city is landlord 
partner and major investor 
the city leaders recognize how important it is and theyre not 
going to let it fail he said they just cant

many southern baptists are expected to 
shun this years denominational convention in las vegas nev 
because of the citys distance from baptist enclaves and the 
reputation of the gamblers paradise 
some may also do so because theyre tired of the prolonged 
partisan strife in the 148 millionmember denomination the 
countrys largest protestant body 
although its annual conventions in recent years have attracted 
large crowds hitting a high mark of 45000 in 1985 only 13000 to 
15000 are expected june 1315 at the las vegas convention center 
lee porter registration secretary estimated the reduced 
attendance based on responses from congregations each may send a 
maximum number of delegates called messengers based on 
membership and financial contributions 
for the last 10 years huge turnouts have been spurred by the 
conflict going on between fundamentalist and moderate factions 
although the struggle continues fatigue with it has become evident 
porter said there are a lot of other reasons for lessened 
attendance the first being the extreme distance to las vegas 
from the area of southern baptist concentration mostly in the south 
the second reason our crowd is going to be down is that some of 
our churches and some of our leaders have a problem going to las 
vegas because of the reputation of the city he said 
attendance typically is a family affair and many baptists dont 
want to bring their children to las vegas and expose them to the 
citys seamier side 
while a previous convention approved meeting in los vegas this 
year the choice had passed only by a narrow margin 
perhaps an underlying factor in the expected lower attendance is 
members boredom with bickering between fundamentalists and 
moderates who for 10 years have tried unsuccessfully to topple 
fundamentalist control 
the key battle has been over the denominational presidency but 
moderates sometimes called centrists so far have been unable to 
win it for a decade 
the president appoints key committees which determine the 
personnel and policies of southern baptist agencies and 
institutions while many baptists are tired of the struggle it 
shows no signs of abating 
they dont want to go and spend a week arguing porter said 
thats not good christianity or good religion you just dont 
enjoy that 
if attendance does drop as porter predicts it might help 
moderates elect their candidate the rev daniel vestal pastor of 
dunwoody baptist church in suburban atlanta 
he is pitted against the rev jerry vines the 
fundamentalistbacked president he was elected last year and is 
unlikely to be unseated since no incumbent who has sought a second 
term in recent history has been defeated 
vestal said he is is doubtful that a low turnout would help him 
the faction that is now in control has just done an incredible job 
in getting the right types of messengers to the convention 
vestal describes himself as a political novice and said he simply 
represents a broad middle ground of philosophy he added 
there is not going to be unity until there is a kind of 
inclusion of all people in the process the philosophy of the last 
10 years basically says its winner take all there can be no unity 
in that type of attitude 
a winner shares with all is my philosophy i would include 
those in the present leadership and those who are not in the 
leadership this is not between two individuals but it is between 
two philosophies 
despite the conflict porter said most rankandfile baptists 
arent interested 
he said the convention generally is devoid of issues that 
attract attendance adding that there is a lack of controversial 
issues and that produces a lack of interest 
vines said he questions whether boredom with the controversy has 
deterred attendance he added in a telephone interview from his 
first baptist church in jacksonville fla 
my perception is that the projection of lower attendance is 
more due to distance and economic considerations 
perhaps the strongest religious draw to the meeting will be a 
planned proselytism sweep of las vegas by about 2000 baptists 
trying to recruit residents to attend church porter said they hope 
to visit 30000 to 35000 homes on the saturday before the 
convention begins 
they are not going into the casinos they are going into the 
homes where people live and try to give witness porter said 
no matter the turnout vestal said the centrist movement is not 
likely to stall in las vegas 
porter said the centrists probably would have a better chance at 
the convention next year in new orleans since it is closer to their 
areas of strength such as in virginia and north carolina he added 
who wins the election depends on who comes and who is in the 
hall when the vote is taken

george house has been obsessed with 
getting drunks off the road since his son saw 27 people die when 
their church bus was hit last year by a truck driven by a man now 
charged with drunken driving and murder 
eighteenyearold chris house was riding a bus behind the one 
that was hit near carrollton when he got home he was still shaken 
by what he had seen and heard some of the kids that died were close 
to his age 
george house a transit authority of river city bus driver for 11 
years sat down and wrote my company suggesting that any of our 
drivers who spotted a drunk behind the wheel should alert the 
dispatcher to call police 
the transit authority took houses idea to police who got 1900 
to pay for drunk buster on board stickers for participating 
vehicles 
the idea caught on and and there now are approximately 5000 
volunteers like house in the louisville area all equipped with 
twoway radios they are the anonymous tipsters who have made 
drunk busters a success in jefferson county and drawn the 
attention of law enforcers from florida to wyoming 
we now have 25 firms involved and more should come on board 
later theres such a diversity of spotters that the offender wont 
know whether the information leading to his arrest came from a guy 
behind the wheel of a cememt mixer or one driving a floral van 
said police spokesman bob yates 
police have gotten more than 100 calls since drunk busters began 
in december seven months after the carrollton accident and while 
it would be difficult to track each tip in the courts yates said 
drunken driving arrests are up 191 percentthere were 977 dui 
arrests in the first quarter compared to 820 in the 1988 quarter 
there is no doubt in my mind that drunk busters has been 
responsible for the increase were happy with the way things are 
going he said 
house too is happy about drunk busters success its made 
the long arm of the law much longer 
police have gotten requests for information from around the 
country one inquiry came from paul feiner a member of the 
westchester county ny board of legislators who planned to 
recommend adopting the plan i would consider the program a 
success if it gets just one deadly driver off the highway i think 
it makes sense to get people to work with the police 
david shedd president of a beer distributor was critical of 
drunk busters when it was unveiled just before the christmas 
holidays 
our industry was under attack about that time and i thought 
this was another shot being fired at us shedd said i had 
volunteered the services of my employees to help put out a packet 
covering drinking and driving 
the packets went to motels hotels and restaurants and offered 
hints on how bartenders could recognize customers who had too much 
shedd understands the intent of drunk busters but the application 
bothered me 
house 39 a former county corrections officer has turned in 
three suspected drunken drivers recently one of them had a can of 
beer between his legs and a case on the seat beside him 
he and other men like roger coffey the owner of a 23wrecker 
towing fleet have learned to spot signs a motorist may be under the 
influence 
they always slow down when theyve had too much liquor if the 
driver is going 25 mph in a 55 mph zone and he isnt elderly or 
halfblind watch out coffey said you also have to take a 
second look at the guy whose vehicle is weaving in the roadway 
straddling the middle line or accelearating and decelarating 
rapidly 
he said his employees have faithfully followed those guidelines 
and so far have made 25 to 30 calls under drunk busters 
because of the nature of his business coffey had doubts about 
joining the program were the only towing service in it but 
weve never towed a drunk that we turned in he said 
confidentiality helps drunk busters work he said it doesnt 
set up a confrontation between my people and the motorist 
our driver simply alerts the dispatcher and he passes along the 
license number and other information to the police 
coffey said his company responds to 18000 calls a year we see 
a lot of carnage when a drunk is involved it makes you angrier 
than usual

matt frewer as dr mike stratford on cbs 
doctor doctor marches to the beat of a different ekg 
he makes house calls and treats his patients as individuals his 
surgeon father is appalled and his physician partners are dismayed 
his father prefers his patients under anesthesia and his partners 
regard them as payments on the porsche 
the sixepisode series makes its debut monday and the diagnosis 
is hilarious the funny quirky sometimes caustic show was created 
by norman steinberg cowriter of the hit movie comedy my favorite 
year 
we wanted to do something different than your usual 
singleparent sitcom format said frewer bestknown for his role 
as video star max headroom this says some important things 
about the practice of medicine and says them in a very funny way 
norman wrote the show and the usual practice in television is 
dont mutilate my baby norman let the reins go and said anytime 
you want to ad lib go ahead we had a great relationship 
stratford says frewer is basically a nice guy with a wry 
sense of humor he means well but he sometimes tries too hard his 
personal life falls by the wayside because of his work 
stratford is also a novelist and is the medical expert for a 
local television talk show wake up providence doctor 
doctor is set in providence ri 
the show also stars julius carry iii as abraham butterfield 
stratfords best friend and one of the partners in the clinic 
maureen mueller as another partner and a former girlfriend and beau 
gravitte as dr grant linowitz the upwardly mobile cardiologist 
prior to doctor doctor frewer played a double role on max 
headroom as tv reporter edison carter and his computergenerated 
image max headroom who became the quintessential star of the video 
age the show which was created in england ran on home box office 
and on abc two seasons ago max headroom was also the star of a 
series of cocacola commercials 
max headroom was fun to do except for the makeup said 
frewer they wanted everyone to think it really was 
computergenerated but it wasnt essentially it was me in makeup 
it took 2 hours to put it on an 1 hours to take it off the only 
effect was to take out a frame about every 12 frames to give it a 
jerky look 
we perpetuated the myth that he was a computergenerated 
character max kept getting the cover of magazines i was jealous of 
my alter ego 
after max headroom frewer costarred with rick moranis in a 
disney movie called honey i shrunk the kids which will be 
released this month he also starred in the opening episode this 
season of nbcs miami vice an episode of nbcs st 
elsewhere he costarred with drew barrymore in the movie far 
from home and was in speed zone the third in the 
cannonball movie series 
the disney movie made in mexico stars moranis as a man who 
invents a machine that shrinks people and objects rick and i are 
both from canada and we spent the whole time singing bachman turner 
overdrive songs he said that music was canadas claim to fame 
in rock n roll 
frewer was actually born in washington where his father a 
canadian navy officer was assigned to the canadian embassy he grew 
up in victoria british columbia 
i did some school plays but what i really wanted to do was 
play hockey he said but when i was 15 i was severely injured 
while playing i was on crutches for nine months i play now with a 
celebrity hockey team we play retired national hockey league 
players i have all their bubble gum cards its a nonchecking

graceful exits are rare among players who reach 
the national political stage and have to leave before theyre ready 
politicians tend to hang on past the applause especially when they 
get into trouble 
they linger seeking vindication from colleagues or one more term 
from the voters sometimes both 
rep tony coehlo of california the democratic whip is an 
exception former speaker of the house jim wright took the more 
traveled course 
wright resigned as speaker on tuesday he left with no apologies 
in the manner of president richard m nixon 15 years ago 
wright said hed made mistakes oh boy how many but he 
did not seem to count among them the ethics charges that brought him 
down 
like other politicians who have been forced from power wright 
said he could have won but resigned to avoid a long and damaging 
battle on the house floor but by the time he announced he would 
quit on may 31 it was evident that he was going to lose 
all things considered it became obvious that short of an 
allout harsh and bitter fight on the house floor it would be 
unrealistic to expect a complete exoneration which is the only 
thing i was interested in wright said 
coehlo is resigning one week from today his 47th birthday 
rather than face an ethics investigation of his own but for that 
cloud and the startling way he chose to dispel it he would have 
become majority leader and in all probability a future speaker 
coehlos problem stemmed from a junk bond investment made with 
borrowed money and aided by a california savings and loan executive 
it gained him all of 6882 
he said he regretted the deal but that it was now fully 
disclosed and that he had violated no rules coehlo said he could 
have proved all that but at a greater cost to him his party and 
his causes than he was willing to pay 
some say this is not the type of mistake to do what you are 
doing he said in modesto calif after announcing his 
resignation i made a mistake im willing to live with it and 
its time to move on 
he hasnt said what he is going to do next his resignation ends 
any prospect of a house inquiry into the 1986 junk bond deal 
although the government still could investigate his conduct 
that could work to his ultimate advantage if his conduct is 
cleared his quick clean break left political bridges intact 
preserving the chance of a return to democratic influence and 
perhaps public office 
few do 
until now republicans held the franchise for the most striking 
political departures of the era the twoone resignations of vice 
president spiro t agnew and president nixon 
agnew quit under criminal charges on oct 10 1973 he pleaded no 
contest to income tax evasion and resigned as part of a plea bargain 
in which other charges were dropped and the government asked for 
leniency not prison 
even so he left with a familiar claim saying he was sparing the 
country a distraction that could have dragged on for two or three 
years 
as you are aware the accusations against me cannot be resolved 
without a long divisive and debilitating struggle in the congress 
and in the courts agnew wrote nixon 
barely 10 months later nixon faced three impeachment charges 
before becoming the first president to resign he had been forced by 
the supreme court to release a tape transcript that proved his 
involvement in the watergate coverup despite two years of denials 
so he faced the television cameras and uttered the most 
difficult sentence i shall ever have to speak his resignation 
in congressional ethics cases the member in the dock often 
leaves with a warning to colleagues that they might be next wright 
didnt make that explicit although he called his fate mindless 
cannibalism and then said nobody should try to get even 
when sen thomas j dodd of connecticut was censured by the 
senate in 1967 for using political money to pay personal bills a 
practice since legalized in some cases he called it a grave 
mistake and injustice and said such things could happen to others 
he lost the next election running as an independent because the 
democrats didnt want him his son christopher is a connecticut 
senator now 
that was also the year the house refused to seat rep adam 
clayton powell jr of new york on grounds he had misused 40000 in 
congressional funds he ran again won again and got his seat back 
in 1969 even before the supreme court overruled his exclusion 
outright expulsions from congress are rare a member facing that 
ultimate sanction usually resigns when the outcome becomes 
inevitable 
one who did not was rep michael myers of philadelphia kicked 
out in 1980 for accepting a bribe in the fbis abscam operation 
one who did was sen harrison a williams jr of new jersey in 
1982 
williams convicted of bribery and conspiracy in abscam quit 
after five days of senate debate that made clear he couldnt win 
he said hed been the victim of an fbi setup that had put every 
senator at risk it is all of us the entire senate 
it wasnt senate or house then or now

as interest rates drop smart homeowners with 
variable rate mortgages are preparing for a great leap forward by 
voluntarily raising their monthly payments 
such homeowners and there are lots of them exploit the cyclical 
nature of interest rates by accelerating their payments when rates 
are down and slowing them when rates rise thus obtaining the 
greatest return for their dollar 
not everyone has the cash flow to do so of course but even 
small amounts can make a big difference when repeated for many 
months 
assuming a fiveyear cycle of high and low rates some of these 
homeowners add to their payments for the 30 months or so when rates 
are lowest and then add nothing to their payments during the high 
end of the cycle 
in such ways they can pare years from the maturity date of their 
loans 
the theory is similar to what is practiced regularly in the stock 
market where wise investors buy when stock prices are low and avoid 
further commitments when prices are high thus getting the most 
shares for the dollar 
in real estate homeowners in effect obtain more equity for the 
dollar by adding to their payments when their variable mortgage 
rates fall in effect such prepayments 
buy more equity for the buck 
accelerate the equityloan ratio or the amount of the monthly 
payment that goes to equity versus loan repayment 
most of the payment in the first few months of a mortgage loan is 
to repay interest as each month passes more money is applied to 
equity and less to interest until near maturity the payments are 
almost all equity 
by making additional payments that process is hastened not only 
does the additional payment in itself lower the loan amount and 
add to the equity but it jumps the homeowner into the more 
favorable equityloan relationship 
shrink the mortgage maturity date perhaps for example from 
20 years to 18 saving thousands of dollars of interest payments 
all three of these benefits are simply different ways of saying 
the same thing that when you speed up repayments especially when 
rates are at the low point in the cycle you can save substantial 
sums 
unless drastic changes occur in the way the american economy 
operates such opportunities will present themselves at least two or 
three times in a 20year period economies are cyclical forever 
expanding or contracting 
during the old days of fixedrate mortgages homeowners didnt 
have the opportunity to take advantage of these cycles no matter 
what happened to rates in general borrowers were locked into their 
initial contract rates 
variable rates were developed primarily because lenders wanted 
them for their own protection why they reasoned should they be 
locked into low rates for long terms when their own costs of 
obtaining money might rise 
lenders thus obtained the protection they sought but in so doing 
they also left an opening for savvy homeowners 
there is nothing in most mortgage contracts written today to 
prevent borrowers from taking advantage of the low end of the 
interestrate cycle 
even for bankers it seems security comes at a price

both say that they want to cool it to stop the battling both 
take a fundamentalist view of the bible both affirm friendship but 
theyre poised for a fight over the nature of southern baptists 
both claim to represent the genuine baptist way the authentic 
heritage but the two candidates for the denominations presidency 
disagree strongly about principles essential to that heritage 
its a conflict that has gone on for a decade in the nations 
biggest protestant denomination numbering l48 million its 
presidency holds sway over makeup of its operating personnel 
filling that powerful top post is the key decision for the 
denominations convention june 1315 in las vegas determining 
whether fundamentalists will keep the office for an 11th straight 
year 
their incumbent candidate the rev jerry vines of jacksonville 
fla seeks a second term calling for peace in the ranks 
i have made a conscious effort to create an atmosphere where 
healing and reconciliation could occur he says 
his challenger the rev daniel vestal of suburban atlanta 
backed by moderates also calls himself a peacemaker a 
responsible reconciler a bridge to call our people back 
together 
while both speak of peace however both also declare their 
adherence to differing positions on principles considered basic for 
baptists involving the latitude of condoned doctrinal freedom 
on that vines sets certain limits on what is acceptable 
primarily about the bible but impinging on many other issues while 
vestal insists on greater room for acceptable differences 
we have certain parameters which are overwhelmingly accepted in 
southern baptist life vines says adding that he has confined his 
appointments to those whose beliefs are within those approved 
parameters 
vestal says this has clamped on a kind of tight control 
demanding allegiance to it our freedom is being threatened he 
says it has to stopor we are going to destroy this 
denomination 
vines 51 a native georgian has been pastor of first baptist 
church of jacksonville fla for the last seven years vestal 44 
a texan led the first baptist church of midland texas for 12 
years before becoming pastor of suburban dunwoody ga baptist 
church last fall 
weighing against vestals bid is a longtime convention custom 
unvarying in modern history of always giving the incumbent a second 
term vines also is riding a fundamentalist tide 
its appointive authority surpassing that of any post in us 
christianity determines trustees that control the denominations 26 
agencies and institutions with budgets totalling about 400 million 
annually 
in my second year vines told baptist press i would 
emphasize building soulwinning churches and i would like to lead 
our convention to a renewed emphasis on church growth 
we have settled the debate over the nature of scripture now it 
is time to move into a new era of growth in our local churches 
vestal says that humanly speaking it is not likely that i will 
be elected although im going to try if he does win he says he 
would seek a limitation on presidential powers to depoliticize 
that office 
the pattern of the last 10 years has been basically a 
philosophy of winnertake all he says my philosophy would be 
that the winner shares all 
curiously both vines and vestal espouse biblical inerrancy 
meaning scripture is literally without error historically 
religiously or scientifically 
however vines policy has restricted appointments to persons 
inside those parameters linked to the paramenters have been 
various social positions such as against divorced personnel 
abortion or ordaining women 
vestal says his appointments would be from a different 
perspective i would include all southern baptists on both sides 
of the prolonged conflict 
he says that he himself is an inerrantist about the bible 
but also is a centrist who accepts differing approaches under 
the baptist principle of the right of believers to interpret 
scripture as each understands it 
vines seeking to deflect sharp conflict from the convention has 
asked the executive committee to postpone action on a highly 
controversial proposal to establish a separate washington dc 
religiousliberty arm 
it would be an alternative to the current agency in which nine 
baptist bodies cooperate the baptist joint committee on public 
affairs fundamentalists have assailed it as not adhering to their 
social agenda 
vines says he wants the matter deferred so the convention can 
focus on evangelism and be as positive and united as possible 
vestal who has campaigned in church meetings in several states 
says he wants the convention to return to its timehonored 
principles such as local church autonomy and priesthood of 
believers emphasizing their equal rights 
we have forsaken basic principles he says it is a power 
or control issue and southern baptists have got to resist it we 
have got to stand up and say enough is enough

when he talks about his favorite topics music and singing 
lately hes been practicing all night and he says praying is 
the only thing that can help me now 
its a tactic thats served him well relying on religion in 
part brought him from a rich bog of musicial influences in his 
native new orleans to the splendor of new yorks alice tully hall at 
lincoln center 
he arrived in new york at age 18 got a room at the local ymca 
and within a month had a job playing the piano in a church then 
another church in the bronx needed a choir director after that 
gigs at little dives here and there led to others the joints 
got classier the pianos better tuned 
three years later he has two albums out with columbia records 
the first called harry connick jr and the second 20 as in 
his age at the time earlier this year he had a successful and 
often soldout run at the famed algonquin hotel 
his repertoire relies heavily on nostalgia harold arlens if i 
only had a brain hoagy carmichaels lazy river and bart 
howards in other words also called fly me to the moon 
connick finds the whole notion of todays popular music 
distressing 
they dont understand said connick his trademark slick 
ashblond hair bobbing back and forth referring to no one in 
particular and everyone in general who produces and performs trendy 
tunes 
there was just an innocence which is lost in american society 
today can you imagine how nice it would have been back in the 
40s the innocence they had back then there is such a joyousness 
about the music back then 
still his passion for the past leaves many puzzled 
people always say harry why do you do all those old songs i 
would just run out of songs to play connick said of his first 
days as a performer in new york when hed be pressed to play for 
hours on end 
i would hear a song like somewhere over the rainbow by 
harold arlen and i would say that sure is a pretty song im going 
to buy all his music then i started reading his music and realized 
he wrote come rain or come shine that old black magic its 
only a paper moon and a bunch of other songs that are really great 
not only lyrically are they wonderful to sing but the melodies 
are so perfect connick said no one writes like that now 
he denies hes on a revival trip and says his polished image 
big pouty lips slicked back short hair and loosefitting suits 
isnt calculated 
i didnt say what can i do to market myself i got it ill 
slick my hair back wear baggy suits and sing songs from the 40s 
everything just happened coincidentally 
not completely 
growing up near new orleans bohemian french quarter with parents 
who loved to indulge their boys musicial aspirations helped make 
the package of harry connick jr what it is today 
he made his first public performance when he was 5 for his 
fathers inauguration as the citys district attorney i got up 
there and i remember hearing that applause and i said i gotta have 
more of that where can i get more of that 
in his quest for a big happy audience he began to study a host 
of musicial influences rhythm and blues honkytonk bebop and 
stride stride is a devilish piano style that requires one hand to 
race across the keyboard at a furious speed while the other one 
pounds away at a different tempo 
he began to incorporate sounds from other artists including 
erroll garner earl hines duke ellington thelonius monk and louis 
prima under the tutelage of jazz pianist ellis marsalis father of 
wynton and branford connick began to master bebop 
the marsalis family played a large role in connicks young 
career connick admits one of the reasons he moved to new york was 
to be near his friend wynton marsalis the grammywinning jazz and 
classical trumpeter delfeayo marsalis wyntons brother produced 
connicks first album which was recorded in one afternoon in 
january 1987 
but on this day ballads were on connicks mind he said hed 
been listening to a piece by frank sinatra from the album in the 
wee small hours over and over again he jumps up and plays it to 
explain a nuance of the pain he hears in sinatras voice and how he 
hopes to one day be able to sing a ballad as well 
hes saying i get along without you very well of course i 
do connick said hes being sarcastic 
now listen he adds reciting the lyrics along with the 
music except when soft rains call and the drip of the leaves 
then i recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms of course 
i do 
connick stares off and gets a melancholy look in his eyes 
these days they just dont understand he said

when jonathan silverman was first offered his 
role in the hbo movie traveling man he loathed the character 
i enjoyed the script but i couldnt see myself in it he 
said it called for someone in his late 20s cocky and a 
southerner i read it again i really hated billy fox 
but the more i hated him the more i loved him then when i 
heard john lithgow was also going to play the older salesman i was 
thrilled 
billy fox is a pushy opportunistic young hustler ready to steal 
his mentors sales route out from under him in the hbo film 
premiering sunday 
silverman is best known for playing nice jewish boys most 
particularly eugene jerome in playwright neil simons 
autobiographical trilogy brighton beach memoirs biloxi 
blues and broadway bound silverman played the role on 
broadway and in the movie version of brighton beach memoirs 
traveling man described as a combination of death of a 
salesman and tin men was written five years ago by david 
taylor the crackerjack movie with fine performances all around 
had kicked around so long because it wasnt considered commercial 
enough until it was picked up by home box office 
ben cluett john lithgow is a middleaged salesman of industrial 
foam in the deep south whose spectacular sales record hits a slump 
john glover is the district sales manager with an evangelical fury 
and a heart of stone glover induces cluett to take along rookie 
salesman billy fox to show him the ropes what billy has in mind is 
to hang cluett from the ropes and take over his lucrative route 
irvin kershner the empire strikes back the flimflam 
man directed the movie was shot in atlanta and new orleans it 
also stars margaret colin as a caring woman billy meets during mardi 
gras 
ive never played a character as shady or with such evil 
intentions as billy fox silverman said during a break in shooting 
his next movie sketches also starring c thomas howell and 
jason bateman hes a very complex character but he has to come 
across as naive and innocent until he sticks it to john lithgow 
hes thoroughly messed up bens life but when billy gets into 
trouble ben comes back and rescues him john lithgows my idol it 
was a thrill to work with him but it was difficult to yell at him 
and hit him 
silverman grew up in beverly hills and was 17 when he landed the 
role in brighton beach memoirs in 1983 replacing matthew 
broderick 
working in brighton beach memoirs was my first job and my 
first time away from home he said id never intended to become 
an actor it was just something id done in high school my passion 
was playing baseball and i went back and forth between baseball and 
drama an agent saw me in a school play and called me i thought it 
was a friend playing a joke he sent me on an audition and thats 
how i was cast in the play 
his other film credits include stealing home caddyshack 
ii girls just want to have fun and weekend at bernies 
he was on the nbc series gimme a break in 198486 the producers 
had a role written for him after seeing him on stage 
in weekend at bernies which will be released in july 
silverman and andrew mccarthy play two insurance agents who stumble 
across some information on a crime they tell their boss who turns 
out to be the crook 
the boss invites us to his beach house so he can have the mafia 
kill us silverman said but they kill him instead so its two 
guys with a body theres a party going on in the house and no one 
else is aware hes dead its a very black comedy 
whats next for silverman im being offered a lot of things 
he said i usually have to fight for things this is a lovely 
time but i havent decided yet what to accept

the allure of star trek has long delighted 
its followers and confounded its detractors star william shatner 
has an explanation 
is it possible that were creating a mythology that we touch a 
mythological vein somewhere the more i read and the more i think 
about it i wonder if the key to star trek is not all the 
wonderful stuff we talk about the character interplay the scifi 
action and adventure and all those good things that seem to be on 
the surface he said 
somewhere underneath the chemistry and the concept touch upon 
a mythological need in modern culture thats my real thought i 
dont quite know what i mean it would take a far more intelligent 
and perceptive person to divine what i mean 
paramount pictures takes a far less intellectual view of the 
phenomenon the company still makes nice rentals on the 1960s tv 
series and star trek the next generation has prospered in 
syndication a 50 million gamble on the 1979 star trek the 
motion picture paid off handsomely star trek iv the voyage 
home was the highest moneymaker of the series earning 57 million 
in rentals 
now comes star trek v the final frontier directed by 
william shatner why would he want to take on the onerous job of 
guiding an immensely complicated production 
directing a film is the end of the rainbow he said in an 
interview youve seen those tshirts what i really want to do 
is direct what i really want to do is direct ive directed 
several stage plays some television i thought that directing a 
huge largebudget motion picture might be something that would be 
the culmination of all my efforts 
i was indeed the culmination of my career i dont know if 
this will be the end of my career it is certainly the top moment of 
my life and it was everything i hoped it would be 
leonard nimoy who directed the voyage home as well as 
three men and a baby and the good mother gives his costar 
good marks as a director 
i think hes terrific nimoy said he has a quality which 
is wonderful its an almost childlike desire to entertain to tell 
a story to capture your attention to surprise you and touch you 
make you laugh he wants to do that to be a fun storyteller that 
kind of exuberance will serve him well 
nimoy also discussed the difference in their directorial styles 
the joke is that in a william shatner film he does a lot more 
running and jumping he said hes much more physical as a 
person than i am ive always been a lot more sedentary always made 
more cerebral choices in my acting he makes more physical choices 
he would rather do a chase than a conversation 
the final frontier was shatners baby from the beginning he 
submitted a 14page original story about a messianic leader who 
kidnaps the enterprise and its crew and takes them to a faraway land 
where he believes god resides producer harve bennett approved his 
story idea and the pair worked on the plot with david loughery who 
wrote the script 
production was stalled by two industry strikes and nimoys 
commitment to direct the good wife 
the final frontier had only 18 weeks in postproduction 
shatner said which was about onethird of what was needed the 
speed may have contributed to bad previews which were reported in 
the press the movie was retooled for its wide release on june 9 
with all of his directorial duties was shatner the actor 
neglected 
interesting he mused if i had been handed this script and 
somebody else was directing i probably have gone in and said 
look i dont think the character is quite focussed 
i might have shortchanged myself as the egotistical actor let 
me rephrase that i dont mean egotistical in the bad sense i mean 
in the actor whose sole point of view is the character 
my job when hired for capt kirk was to keep my focus on capt 
kirk to protect capt kirk to make him as exciting and make him 
move as well as possible he said 
i didnt want to do that with this film i wanted to open 
myself up and make sure the other characters were not only protected 
but a great deal was made of them 
shatner 58 is a canadian born and reared in montreal he 
started acting early 
i began at the age of six acting in camp plays he related 
i continued in montreal amateur theatricals as a teenager i put 
myself through college with radio work i went to the professional 
theater when i graduated from the university mcgill stayed in the 
professional theater through thick and thin ive never done 
anything else but act write and direct 
trained in the classics at the stratford ontario shakespeare 
festival he made his broadway debut in the festivals tamburlaine 
the great shatner became one of the busiest actors in live tv 
dramas won an mgm contract and made his film debut in the 
brothers karamazov 
for a time he bounced between the theater the world of suzie 
wong a shot in the dark films judgment at nuremberg 
the outrage and television for the people 
in 1965 gene roddenberry produced a pilot of a new space series 
starring jeffrey hunter as capt christopher pike nbc gave it 
thumbs down declaring it too cerebral roddenberry shot a second 
pilot for star trek casting william shatner as capt james t 
kirk in what became something of a lifetime job

us banks are tightening lending guidelines for 
chineseforeign business ventures because of the civil strife that 
threatens to engulf china and american companies are accelerating 
their retreat from the country 
reversing its position of a day earlier mcdonnell douglas 
corps douglas aircraft co announced tuesday it was evacuating 
expatriates and was among the first companies to charter a plane for 
the pullout 
the douglas aircraft workers included 43 from a shanghai factory 
that assembles md80 twinjets seven workers based in the southwest 
city of chengdu and one representative in the northeast city of 
shenyang 
weve changed our situation in china we decided last night to 
begin pulling our people out of china back to hong kong douglas 
aircraft spokesman donald hanson said from company headquarters in 
long beach calif the situation apparently has changed 
overnight 
babcock amp wilcox co also was moving out its staff of about 30 
workers housed near beijings summer palace and hewlettpackard co 
was attempting to withdraw an unspecified number of people from 
beijing and shanghai 
several other companies also ordered employees to leave china and 
scrapped business trips there because of the growing fear of civil 
war 
the intensified effort to get employees out reflected the 
deteriorating situation in beijing since the weekend when soldiers 
killed hundreds of unarmed prodemocracy demonstrators and other 
civilians protests have flared in other cities and it has become 
unclear if anyone is running the country 
in another sign that the chaos may have a widening and profound 
economic impact us banks began reviewing credit to companies that 
do business with china and shortened time limits on new loans for 
trade and investment projects 
were doing something all banks are doing just making sure any 
new commitments and any renewed commitments are kept very 
shortterm three months or less said an official of one major 
new york bank who asked not to be identified by name 
an official of another big new york bank who also requested 
anonymity said its obvious that any sensible countryrisk 
process would be operative under present conditions and commitments 
would be reviewed 
bank of america chase manhattan bank chemical bank citibank 
and first chicago are among some of the prominent us banking 
companies with offices in china many established representative 
offices there after relations were normalized a decade ago 
the banks main role is to expedite financing for joint ventures 
between us and chinese companies but their direct loans to the 
chinese are considered inconsequential and arent reported in their 
accounting statements 
a study by morgan guaranty trust co estimated that total us 
bank loan exposure in china was less than 1 billion 
nonetheless chinas government historically has been considered 
an excellent credit risk and many other foreign banks have loaned 
money to the country 
the institute of international finance a washington research 
organization for commercial banks estimates chinas foreign debt 
totaled 424 billion at the end of 1988 of which 46 percent was in 
commercial bank loans but the size of the debt compared with the 
countrys overall economic output is small 
a simple way of looking at it is that china doesnt have that 
much external commercial debt said thomas layman the institutes 
director for asia and the pacific

a los angeles television station was not 
required to tell viewers that a toy maker was providing a childrens 
program in exchange for free advertising time the federal 
communications commission ruled 
the commission in a ruling tuesday that upholds the common 
industry practice of barter sales denied a complaint that 
kcoptv should have identified mattel inc and tv syndicator group w 
productions as the sponsors of the animated cartoon show heman 
and the masters of the universe 
the losangeles based national association of better broadcasting 
had characterized the childrens fantasy show as a nonstop 
depiction of heman logo and heman toy products which are 
made by mattel 
the association said the barter arrangement whereby mattel and 
group w provided heman in exchange for two minutes of 
commercials distributed throughout kcops childrens program 
schedule constituted a token payment given the cost of 
producing the shows 
the association said the producers spent 14 million to make 65 
episodes of the program 
the association in a 1984 complaint said section 317 of the 
1934 communications act requires that sponsors be identified 
whenever shows are provided free or with only nominal payment 
but kcop valued the commercial time at 300000 a year at the 
same time it said that even if the payment were deemed token 
section 317 does not require sponsor identification when the 
sponsors are mentioned incidentally or not at all in the broadcast 
the fcc in 1985 denied the complaint which had been joined by 
action for childrens television nabb appealed to the us court of 
appeals in washington which in september 1987 remanded the case to 
the commission 
the fcc denied the complaint again tuesday 
i guess it would be amazing if they had voted any other way 
peggy charren head of action for childrens television said of the 
30 fcc ruling 
she said the problem of advertising messages slipped into tv 
programs was one of the sorriest problems in all of broadcasting 
and that the fcc was saying they are going to let everything relax 
on the subject of advertising and editorial content 
nabb president frank orme said his group would continue the fight 
whatever they have done the court will have to approve orme 
said by telephone from los angeles i think eventually we will win 
this 
charrens group which helped write a bill pending in congress 
that would reimpose limits on the amount of commercials on kids 
shows had said various broadcasters were violating fcc regulations 
by airing heman and seven other programs with substantial 
product tieins 
but the commission in its 1985 ruling said such the shows were 
not programlength commericials the commission said the 
broadcasters had made a good faith determination that heman and 
the other challenged programs possessed significant entertainment 
value for child audiences 
the appeals court said the fcc had interpreted section 317 
incorrectly and it instructed the agency to devise a standard to 
determine if section 317 covers barter arrangements 
in its ruling tuesday the fcc admitted it erred when it said 
section 317 applied only to broadcasts that were purely commercial 
in content as for determining a standard it said kcop clearly had 
paid more than a nominal fee for heman and section 317 
therefore did not apply 
the commission said it was not its business to engage in a 
detailed review of the adequacy of a broadcasters payment in every 
case in which a program discount is alleged 
it such such an approach would not necessarily further the 
statutory objectives is unlikely to yield conclusive results and 
could require disclosures that cause substantial competitive harm to 
program suppliers

stronger

mexico and other independent petroleum 
producers will proceed with plans to cut exports by 5 percent even 
if opec raises production as expected the government news agency 
notimex said 
the government news service notimex on tuesday quoted raul robles 
segura assistant commercial director for the government oil 
monopoly pemex as saying the cuts would not significantly hurt 
business 
robles said that during the first five months of this year pemex 
already has exceeded its profit estimates for all of 1989 by 40 
percent 
robles remarks came as opec oil ministers meeting in vienna 
tried to restart stalled negotiations over a new production and 
pricing agreement 
mexico does not belong to the 13member organization of petroleum 
exporting countries and is not governed by the groups agreements 
however it historically has followed cartel guidelines 
opec talks had centered on how to divide any additional 
production among the member countries 
the ministers seemed to agree on lifting production levels to 
195 million barrels a day or at most 20 million barrels a day in 
the last six months of the year the ceiling in the januaryjune 
period is 185 million barrels daily 
a pemex statement released tuesday quoted robles as saying he was 
confident that an opec production cap would help maintain petroleum 
prices worldwide 
robles said that during the first five months of this year pemex 
exported a daily average of 13 million barrels of crude oil with an 
average price of 1532 a barrel

goodyear tire and rubber co 
one of the largest us companies in south africa today announced 
it is pulling out of the country after 42 years and selling its 
assets to a south african company 
a combination of economic and political factors were responsible 
for goodyears decision to divest its uitenhage south africa tire 
and general products manufacturing operation 
the business will be sold to consol limited an industrial 
subsidiary of anglovaal ltd a south african financial industrial 
and mining group 
tom h barrett goodyears chairman president and chief 
executive officer said the company regrets leaving south africa 
after providing jobs there for more than four decades 
but in an announcement of the sale he stated it is becoming 
increasingly difficult for american companies to obtain adequate 
returns on investments there 
barrett said the reasons for goodyears disinvestment included 
us sanctions against south africa double us taxation of south 
african earnings and the likelihood of a continuing decline in the 
value of the south african rand against major currencies 
the us congress in late 1987 enacted legislation that 
eliminates a tax credit for us companies that allowed them to 
deduct taxes paid to south africa against taxes owed to the us 
government 
the former reagan administration opposed the amendment and 
considered fighting to have it repealed but it remains the law 
former us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said at 
the time the bill was passed that the most likely effect will be 
to accelerate the takeover of us assets by south african firms at 
bargain prices 
barrett said anglovaal ltd was a reponsible group that had 
demonstrated concern for human rights in the workplace and had 
expressed intentions to retain the current workforce of 2400 
people the majority of whom are black and colored 
mike mcnamara chairman and managing director of goodyears south 
african business said the company would continue to operate under 
the same management 
we have always taken great pride in our people and our 
management team and employees have vast knowledge of the local tire 
and rubber industry said mcnamara for them we will continue 
to operate under present employment policies practices and benefits 
and all existing agreements and arrangements with our two trade 
unions remain unaltered 
goodyear began manufacturing tires in south africa in 1947 the 
year before the south african government adopted the apartheid 
policy of racial separation 
over the years goodyear took the position that it could 
contribute to social progress in south africa by maintaining its 
operations in the country 
the company says it has spent more than 10 million in education 
and training of blacks housing and social programs in south africa 
goodyear has adhered to the sullivan principles a set of guidelines 
for companies operating in south africa that address employment and 
other practices 
however barrett stated with the prospect of everdiminishing 
returns on our south african investment our responsibility to our 
shareholders must take precedence 
the sale will result in a onetime charge of about 44 million 
after taxes or 77 cents a share which will be taken against 
goodyears secondquarter results 
over the past five years excluding goodyear 195 us companies 
have divested their holdings in south africa

bank of france governor jacques de larosiere 
said wednesday that the top seven industrialized nations continue to 
cooperate to keep exchange rates stable despite recent volatility in 
world markets 
there has been some volatility over the past month he told a 
bankers forum but what is important is that the international 
cooperation put in play since 1985 is still operating 
the seven major countries are on the same wavelength and do 
understand the problems in the same fashion de larosiere said at 
the end of the threeday international monetary conference attended 
by members of 99 comercial banks from 22 countries 
he said the major task of the cooperation was to keep inflation 
down and sustain current economic growth 
de larosiere made the remarks to reporters after a closed meeting 
with private bankers and central bank governors or senior officials 
of the united states japan west germany england and spain 
sir jeremy morse chairman of lloyds bank plc moderated the 
central bankers discussion and appeared later before reporters 
us federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and bundesbank 
president karl otto pohl participated in the closeddoor panel but 
did not attend the press briefing 
morse said greenspan had told the bankers it was difficult to 
correctly evaluate the recent rise in the dollars value 
but he said greenspan indicated the dollars rise appeared to be 
more of a market phenomenon than the result of fundamental economic 
factors 
morse said the central bank officials did not believe the dollar 
was likely to go raging on 
the bank of englands robin leighpemberton sai the degree of 
currency stability is still reasonably satisfactory if seen from 
the view of whether it inhibits crossborder investment 
he added that the markets had seemed to incorrectly imply that 
the international coordination policy on exchange rates had given 
up 
takeshi ohta the bank of japans deputy governor for 
international relations said policy coordination among the major 
nations does not always mean taking measures at the same time in 
the same direction 
but he said we should be able to move swifly when necessary 
he and de larosiere expressed concern over too much emphasis 
being placed on monetary policy to attempt to cut back economic 
imbalances

opec oil ministers today held a flurry of 
bargaining sessions to try to break a deadlock in negotiations for a 
new production and pricing agreement 
we are working toward an agreement for sure said iraqi oil 
minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi 
the ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries held private meetings in their hotel rooms in 
late morning and early afternoon they took a break after lunch and 
planned further discussions in late afteroon 
we are consulting with each other and hope to reach an 
agreement said qatars minister abdul aziz bin khalifa althani 
he predicted a deal could be struck within the next two days 
opec secretarygeneral subroto raised the possibility that all 13 
ministers would gather at cartel headquarters later in the day to 
resume their formal strategy session 
the ministers opened their midyear conference on monday then 
broke up to bargain privately 
the talks have stalled over a kuwaiti demand for a much larger 
share of any increase in cartel production in the last half of the 
year other members including influential saudi arabia want the 
increase shared proportionately among all the members 
a lot of work needs to be done iranian oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh said tuesday we need about one or two days 
for consultations aqazadeh said 
a delegate from one nation who demanded anonymity said its 
a deadlock 
the ministers seemed in agreement on lifting their production cap 
to 195 million barrels a day or at most 20 million barrels a day 
in the last six months of the year the ceiling in the januaryjune 
period is 185 million barrels a day 
the ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining their 
benchmark price of 18 a barrel saudi arabia had recommended 
getting rid of the target price 
the cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 185 
million barrels a day for the januaryjune period well under output 
levels at that time 
cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond the 
cartels 18 benchmark 
prices have eased a bit recently as opec has turned up its 
production but the price of a basket of crudes monitored by the 
cartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of late 
november 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for july 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude has 
been trading at more than 20 a 42gallon barrel 
the international energy agency meanwhile reported that the 
opec nations lifted their crude production by 500000 barrels a day 
in may to 21 million barrels the highest so far this year 
this was primarily the result of higher production in kuwait 
and nigeria partly offset by a small decline in iranian and 
ecuadorian production it said 
the slippage in ecuadors output it said was due to a landslide 
that damaged the countrys main oil pipeline 
the agencys monthly oil market report predicted demand for the 
cartels oil would rise in the second half of the year to about 
2085 million barrels a day the agency previously estimated demand 
for the period at 204 million barrels a day

lin broadcasting corp shares shot higher 
in early trading today in response to a 65 billion takeover offer 
by mccaw cellular communications inc 
the 120ashare unsolicitated offer disclosed after stock 
trading closed late tuesday would solidify mccaws position as the 
nations largest cellular telephone company 
in national overthecounter trading early today lin was up 
2425 a share to 12725 mccaw rose 250 to 4575 a share 
mccaw which is lins largest shareholder with a 98 percent 
stake has franchises serving customers in seattle san francisco 
miami denver minneapolis and portland ore 
new yorkbased lin operates seven networkaffiliated television 
stations and has interests in cellular systems serving new york los 
angeles philadelphia dallas and houston it also owns a specialty 
publishing house that produces hardcover tourist guides for hotel 
rooms 
lin said in a statement it would study the offer carefully and 
act in the best interests of its shareholders 
there had been speculation for months that mccaw would launch an 
offer for lin 
lin announced two weeks ago that its board had approved in 
principle spinning off all of the stock in a new subsidiary that 
would own its tv stations it said it would operate its cellular 
operations along with a specialty publishing business as a separate 
company 
lin said the move was made for operating and strategic reasons 
due to the differences in the nature of the television and 
cellularphone industries 
the mccaw proposal was seen by industry analysts as a recognition 
of the premium that the stock market has placed on the fastgrowing 
cellular business 
given the regional geographic and operational nature of the 
cellular business the logic of combining our two companies is 
compelling mccaw chairman craig o mccaw said in a letter to lin 
chairman donald a pels 
in the letter mccaw called the 65 billion bid the highest 
price per pop in the history of our cellular industry 
pop a yardstick in the industry refers to market area 
populations multiplied by percentage ownership in the cellular 
systems serving those areas 
mccaws cellular telephone systems serve 50 million pops while 
lin serves more than 18 million pops 
the next stage in the development of american cellular 
communications must be the rationalization of the many disconnected 
fragments of our industry the mccaw letter said the mccawlin 
combination would hasten that process we would thus advance the 
effort to provide a truly national cellular network for american 
consumers 
lins tv stations are kxas in fortworthdallas wish in 
inidianpolis wotv in the battle creek mich area wavy in hampton 
roads va kxan in austin texas wand in central illinois and 
wane in fort wayne ind

the court of appeal on wednesday granted british 
port employers an injunction banning a national dock strike 
the strike had been planned for sometime this summer by 9400 
dockers affected by the british governments plans to abolish a job 
guarantee scheme 
the court of appeals verdict overturns an earlier decision by 
the high court which refused to outlaw a dock strike 
the transport and general workers union which represents 
dockworkers is expected to appeal the verdict to britains highest 
court the house of lords 
since the government first announced its intention to abolish the 
dock labor scheme under which employees are guaranteed lifelong job 
security a dispute has raged between employers and unions over 
whether strike action would constitute a political protest 
against the government or a genuine trade dispute 
under the 1982 employment act political disputes are illegal 
last month dockworkers at 46 british ports voted overwhelmingly 
in favor of striking against the governments proposals

the government said today it would sell short 
brothers ltd the ailing belfast aircraft and missile maker to the 
canadian aerospace company bombardier inc for 30 million pounds 
about 47 million 
the announcement ended months of speculation over who would buy 
the stateowned company which is northern irelands largest 
employer after the government said it planned to privatize it 
the northern ireland office said northern ireland secretary tom 
king and bombardier chairman laurent beaudoin reached a formal 
agreement in belfast this morning 
as part of the deal the government has pledged to invest a 
substantial amount in short brothers king said 
the government will inject 372 million pounds 584 million into 
short brothers and write off a 390 millionpound 612 million loan 
it made to shorts earlier this year to help the company pay its 
debts 
the injection is subject to the approval of parliament but the 
conservative government has a parliamentary majority that virtually 
assures approval 
bombardier recognizes the important position occupied by shorts 
in the northern ireland economy and intends to acquire the company 
as a longterm investment and to maintain it as a complete entity 
northern ireland secretary tom king told the house of commons 
its objective is to develop the three main divisions of 
aircraft aerostructures and missiles king said 
under the agreement the shorts name will be retained and the 
company will be kept intact for the foreseeable future king said 
but he said he could not guarantee all jobs would be retained 
in the end nobody can absolutely guarantee jobs to anybody if 
a business is not competitive if in spite of new investment in 
spite of new products there is not the commitment and performance 
and it is not competitive then there cannot be any guarantee of 
jobs he said 
the acquisition was expected to be completed later in the year 
subject to approval by office of fair trading and european 
commission 
last month short brothers announced it was laying off 700 
workers bringing the work force to 7000 because of heavy losses 
the company lost 223 million lin 1988 and another loss is expected 
this year 
short brothers most successful arm is its missile division but 
it also makes its own passenger shorthaul airliners the 360 
36seater and the 330 30seater as well as aircraft components for 
other companies 
bombardier based in montreal is a manufacturer of mass 
transport vehicles its best known products are the challenger 
series of business cargo and commuter aircraft made by its canadair 
aircraft manufacturing company 
bombardier has a 46seat regional commuter aircraft under 
development the only serious rival to shorts fjx twinengined 
regional jetliner project which now is to be scrapped 
bombardier also is involved in research and development of 
missile components and pilotless surveillance aircraft

after several weeks of internal debate the 
federal reserve has taken a cautious first step toward lowering 
interest rates many economists believe 
the action if followed by further moves by the central bank to 
loosen its grip on credit will spell lower borrowing costs for 
businesses and consumers including declines in mortgage rates the 
economists said 
a move to lower interest rates would mark a major policy shift by 
the central bank which launched a campaign in march 1988 to push 
interest rates higher in order to fight inflation 
federal reserve governor martha seger refused to respond directly 
to reporters questions today over whether the fed had indeed 
loosened monetary policy however she said let me put it this 
way i have been opposed to further tightening since late last 
year 
ms seger who has been a frequent dissenter inside the fed 
arguing for lower interest rates responded with a terse no 
comment when asked whether the fed should do even more in pushing 
interest rates lower 
she said following a congressional appearance that it still 
remained to be seen whether the feds yearlong antiinflation 
campaign had slowed economic activity so much that the country would 
topple into a recession 
the bush administration which has been pressing the fed to ease 
up and keep the economy out of a recession had nothing but praise 
for the central bank on tuesday with the presidents chief economic 
adviser michael boskin saying he had utmost confidence in the 
federal reserve 
the fed as usual made no announcement of any change in policy 
but economists who closely watch its activities said they believed 
the central bank had eased slightly based on declines this week in 
the federal funds rate 
this rate which is the interest that banks charge each other to 
make overnight loans is considered the best earlywarning signal of 
fed intentions 
the central bank influences the rate through daily decisions 
about how much money it will make available to the banking system 
the federal funds rate had been averaging between 975 percent 
and 988 percent but it dipped to around 963 percent on monday and 
dropped further to around 956 percent on tuesday 
the fed has eased and we are looking for the federal funds rate 
to go lower said cynthia latta an economist with data resources 
inc a private economic forecasting firm in lexington mass 
ms latta and other analysts said they believe fed policymakers 
have become convinced that the economy has slowed enough to ease 
inflationary pressures 
starting in march 1988 the federal reserve had pushed shortterm 
interest rates up by 3 percentage points in a campaign to cool off 
an overheated economy by making credit costlier 
eliott platt director of economic research for donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette predicted that a host of business and consumer loan 
rates will head lower in the months ahead as the fed loosens credit 
further in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession 
on monday major banks announced that they were cutting their 
prime lending rate by onehalf percentage point to 11 percent the 
first reduction in this benchmark lending rate in more than a year 
platt said he looks for the prime rate to fall to 95 percent 
over the next three to six months 
other economists predicted that mortgage rates are headed lower 
fixedrate mortgages have already fallen to a national average of 
1048 percent last week down from close to 11 percent at the 
beginning of may 
boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers 
refused to comment specifically on the question of whether the fed 
is now pursuing a crediteasing approach 
during an appearance tuesday at the national press club boskin 
did say that the administration has a great deal of confidence 
that the central bank will steer a prudent course between fighting 
inflation and guarding against a recession 
earlier in the year both the president and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady had criticized the central bank for being overly 
concerned about inflation at the risk of harming economic growth 
boskin said tuesday that it made sense for the central bank to 
err on the side of fighting inflation in january and february when 
inflationary pressures were higher 
but he said current signals show that the economy is slowing to a 
more sustainable pace with inflation abating 
analysts said the may unemployment report released last friday 
probably provided the final bit of evidence the central bank needed 
to decide that it could begin loosening its credit grip the 
unemployment rate fell to 52 percent but it was accompanied by the 
weakest advance in job growth in three years 
there were published reports last week that the feds 
policymaking open market committee composed of the seven fed 
governors in washington and five of the 12 regional fed bank 
presidents was split on the question of lowering interest rates and 
unable to come to a policy decision during two telephone conference 
calls 
former fed governor lyle gramley chief economist of the mortgage 
bankers association said the fed may have held another telephone 
conference call in recent days and decided to take a cautious first 
step toward easing 
but he said financial markets would be wrong to expect any quick 
and dramatic moves to ease credit such as a cut in the discount 
rate the interest the fed charges to loan money to financial 
institutions 
i think the fed will be cautious because we are not entirely 
certain that our inflation problem is behind us gramley said

opec oil ministers today reached a 
tentative agreement to raise their production a modest amount to 
keep prices strong in the coming months 
the ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries held a flurry of meetings to try to wrap up an 
agreement 
venezuelan oil minister celestino armas asked if a deal had been 
struck replid yes of course 
saudi arabias hisham nazer said the new production ceiling would 
be 195 million barrels a day the current cap stands at 185 
million barrels for the first six months of the year 
but the cartel according to analysts has been producing above 
that level in recent months 
as a result analysts say an increase of about a million barrels 
in the supply cap should keep crude prices and consumers gasoline 
prices steady 
further details of the accord were not immediately available 
it was unclear whether the agreement would span six months or be 
for a shorter period of time 
it also was not immediately known how the ministers had dealt 
with kuwaits demand for a higher production share 
the ministers opened their midyear conference on monday then 
broke up to bargain privately the talks stalled tuesday largely due 
to kuwaits demand for a much larger share of any increase in cartel 
production in the last half of the year 
other members including influential saudi arabia want the 
increase shared proportionately among all the members 
the ministers also appeared to have settled on retaining their 
benchmark price of 18 a barrel saudi arabia had recommended 
getting rid of the target price 
the cartel late last year agreed on its supply ceiling of 185 
million barrels a day for the januaryjune period well under output 
levels at that time 
cutbacks earlier in the year helped drive prices beyond the 
cartels 18 benchmark 
prices have eased a bit recently as opec has turned up its 
production but the price of a basket of crudes monitored by the 
cartel was still more than 40 percent above the level of late 
november 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for july 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude has 
been trading at more than 20 a 42gallon barrel 
the international energy agency meanwhile reported that the 
opec nations lifted their crude production by 500000 barrels a day 
in may to 21 million barrels the highest so far this year 
the agencys monthly oil market report predicted demand for the 
cartels oil would rise in the second half of the year to about 
2085 million barrels a day the agency previously estimated demand 
for the period at 204 million barrels a day

the rancho seco nuclear plant began 
shutting down today after voters for the first time in us history 
decided to close a working reactor 
with all precincts reporting there were 111867 votes or 534 
percent against a measure that would have kept the plant operating 
and 97460 or 466 percent in favor about 40 percent of 
registered voters turned out 
tuesdays vote was not binding on the sacramento municipal 
utility district which owns the 15yearold plant but a majority 
of its elected board members had promised to abide by the will of 
the people 
the plant is in the process of being shut down today said 
jeff marx a rancho seco spokesman 
marx said the mood is pretty somber at rancho seco where the 
jobs of many of the 1500 to 2000 employees and contractors are in 
jeopardy how many of those workers will be laid off is uncertain 
marx said 
smud general manager david boggs said he would put the plant into 
hot shutdown in which the reactor is operable but producing no 
electricity smud will then confer with the nuclear regulatory 
commission on putting the reactor in cold shutdown and beginning the 
decommissioning he said 
he said he had already informed the smud directors of his plan to 
shut down the plant and would not seek their approval he lamented 
the vote and said decommissioning and dismantling could cost more 
than 210 million 
public citizen a group formed in 1971 by ralph nader said in a 
statement that the vote marks the beginning of the end for nuclear 
power in the united states americas love affair with the atom is 
over it said 
meanwhile in fremont a city of 165000 on the san francisco bay 
a childcare tax measure that was touted as the first of its kind in 
the nation was trounced at the polls 
measure b which would have taxed residents and businesses to pay 
for citywide child care was supported by many working parents 
feminists and business leaders but opposed by activists who targeted 
senior citizens older families and christian groups 
with all precincts reporting there were 3671 votes in favor and 
12697 against the measure needed a twothirds majority to pass 
voters in the utility district that includes most of sacramento 
county and parts of placer county gave rancho seco a reprieve in 
june 1988 but put it on probation until tuesdays vote 
critics claimed the plant 25 miles from californias capital is 
unsafe and has a poor operating record they also expressed anger at 
rising utility bills and pointed to a 400 million repair bill after 
a 1985 overcooling accident that caused a twoyear outage 
but supporters said the 913megawatt plants bad days were over 
thanks to an overhaul and hiring of new managers 
the expense of decommissioning rancho seco together with the 
higher cost of buying electricity from outside sources is expected 
to boost utility bills but estimates vary widely as to how much 
boggs predicted an initial increase of 75 percent in 1990 
kim dellinger a spokeswoman for the the campaign to keep the 
plant open called the vote a big mistake 
it was based on the historical performance of rancho seco and 
frustration with smud without considering the ramifications of 
shutting the plant that supplies half the power of the community 
she said 
the vote tuesday marked the first time in the nation that voters 
chose to shut down an operating nuclear power plant according to 
greg cooke a nuclear regulatory commission spokesman 
nuclear opponents have won elections preventing new nuclear 
plants from being built in some states 
the nuclear industry fearful that a closure vote could 
strengthen nuclear opponents raised 580000 for the campaign to 
keep rancho seco open 
opponents including the campaign california environmental group 
formed by assemblyman tom hayden and his estranged wife actress 
jane fonda raised 111000 according to the latest campaign 
reports

soviet inflation was 8 percent to 9 percent last 
year about double previous government estimates a top economist 
said wednesday 
abel aganbegyan an economic adviser to president mikhail s 
gorbachev said a 4 percent to 5 percent increase in official prices 
combined with another 4 percent rise caused by excess money 
consumers cant spend due to shortages 
deputy finance minister vyacheslav senchagov termed aganbegyans 
estimate too high he said the official estimate for 1988 price 
increases was 27 percent to 28 percent not 4 percent to 5 percent 
the two soviet economists spoke at a conference the soviet 
union in the 1990s sponsored by the international herald tribune 
the soviet unions economicheskaya gazeta and the soviet chamber of 
commerce 
they said the soviet union is hampered by lack of proper 
statistics to determine the actual rate of inflation 
soviet officials denied for years that inflation existed but 
under the influence of gorbachevs reforms have acknowledged 
inflation and begun to talk about how to combat it 
last october deputy statistics director nikolai belov said wages 
rose 67 percent in the first nine months of 1988 but real income 
rose only 35 percent but he refused to term the difference a rate 
of inflation 
aganbegyan said soviet economic reformers were hampered when 
gorbachev took power in 1985 by a lack of understanding of the 
severity of problems economic managers made the situation worse by 
boosting spending on housing education and health but implementing 
no cuts he said 
aganbegyan said that aggravated a budget deficit officially set 
at 35 billion rubles or 56 billion this year but economists said 
including money the government borrows from its savings the deficit 
is more than 100 billion rubles or 160 billion 
senchagov said the soviet government plans to attack the deficit 
by slashing construction expenditures and relying on a drive for 
efficiency for added production 
plans for 80 billion rubles or 140 billion in capital 
investments will be halved and 390 new construction projects will 
be eliminated he said 
gorbachev already has announced a 14 percent defense budget cut 
but ed hewitt of the brookings institute in washington who also 
spoke at the conference said he saw every prospect that the 
deficit will increase 
he called for the government to stop a flood of illconsidered 
economic decrees 
theyve come out quickly theyve been poorly coordinated in 
some cases fighting with each other he said thats basically 
because the reform has gone halfway 
us industrialist armand hammer who began his business career 
with a deal with soviet founder vladimir lenin to supply grain in 
1921 told western businessmen that flexibility would pay off in 
dealings with the soviet union 
above all youve got to have patience the 91yearold 
hammer said i think its worth it because they have a huge 
population and they need everything

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as traders continued to cast 
a wary eye on events in china 
wheat prices were pushed lower by heavy professional and 
commission house selling because of civil unrest in beijing and 
other chinese cities 
there is some doubt among traders that the 185 million metric 
tons of wheat sold to china which was announced earlier this week 
will be shipped or paid for said ted mao an analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york 
although the agriculture department says there has been no 
disruption of business in china it is a situation that can change 
day by day mao said 
added pressure was placed on wheat prices by forecasts for drier 
weather in winter crop areas which is expected to allow farmers to 
move ahead with the harvest 
corn prices were down despite the announcement tuesday of the 
sale of 300000 metric tons of corn to the soviet union 
the forecasts for drier weather is expected to promote soybean 
planting in eastern crop areas while wetter weather in other areas 
is expected to spur growth forcing down soybean prices analysts 
said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 382 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 4 cents lower with july at 257 a bushel oats were unchanged 
with july at 162 a bushel soybeans were 3 cent lower to 1 cent 
higher with july at 711 a bushel

black flag admakers will still the sounding 
of taps when ants and roaches die at the end of one of its insect 
spray commercials 
viewer complaints about a few notes of the bugle call sounded at 
military funerals have prompted the company to alter the ad 
american home products corp of new york maker of black flag 
insecticides said wednesday 
company spokeswoman carol emerling said the notes would be 
deleted within about two weeks in response to an unspecified number 
of complaints 
taps is a symbol said korean war veteran bill temple of bryn 
mawr who called the company wednesday to complain it represents 
the finality of someones incredible sacrifice 
to trivialize it by playing it after blasting a bunch of ants 
and roaches away is terrible he said 
ms emerling wouldnt say who prepared the commercial or how many 
complaints it drew 
it was not a large response but when we heard from a couple of 
people we took another look at it she said 
american home products usually examines ad content before airing 
them to ensure they wont offend viewers ms emerling said 
we really try to be quite careful but every now and then 
naturally judgments differ she said 
temple has been behind drives to build a national korean war 
memorial and to have a 1986 clint eastwood film altered to reflect 
that army troops not marines fought the monthlong battle at 
heartbreak ridge one of the bloodiest in the korean war 
i lost an awful lot of buddies during that time i was in 
combat he said i know what taps means to the people who lost 
friends and relatives 
temple said a woman who answered the telephone at american home 
products told him the company had received several other complaints

with its engines spitting fire and its pencilthin 
nose outlined against gray skies the sleek american spy plane set 
down here wednesday for its debut at the worlds most famous air 
show 
the sr71 reconnaissance jet has never been displayed outside the 
united states but it will be a featured attraction at the paris air 
show where it will stand beside flying machines from the soviet 
union and other nations 
more than 365000 people are expected to attend 
the air show which is to be opened thursday by president 
francois mitterrand will include a celebration of the 20th 
anniversary of americas walk on the moon 
the show held every two years is to the air industry what the 
cannes film festival is to movies a glitzy gathering where products 
are promoted aviation stars strut before reporters deals are 
announced and others are made 
more than 1000 exhibitors from 34 countries will be at the show 
this year and 140000 industry professionals are expected they cut 
deals under the roar of aircraft flying nonstop demonstrations 
overhead 
even before the show officially opened the rainy skies over 
paris le bourget airfield were filled with jets performing feats 
that awed even jaded professionals in the midst of lastminute 
preparations for the displays 
after setting down in the sr71 known as the blackbird because 
of its two vertical stabilizers and sleek profile the pilot and 
systems officer climbed out of the aircraft dressed like astronauts 
before a crowd of photographers they unfurled the blue white and 
red french flag 
first delivered to the us air force in 1966 the plane was 
developed by lockheed aircraft corp as a longrange advanced 
strategic reconnaissance aircraft 
it is one of the fastest and highestflying in the skies today 
it cruises at altitudes above 80000 feet and at speeds of about 
3100 feet per second more than three times faster than sound 
the aircraft carries systems capable of surveying 100000 square 
miles in one hour placing it in direct competition with newer more 
sophisticated satellites 
the soviets also gave a glimmer wednesday of what their planes 
can do 
their soukhoi27 being shown alongside two mig29 jet fighters 
and the soviet space shuttle buran swooped spun and flipped high 
overhead at one moment the highspeed plane seemed to stall dead 
still pulled its nose straight up and flipped over on its back 
apollon systvov the soviet aeronautics industry minister later 
told a news conference the relaxation of international tensions and 
more openness in his country made it possible for greater 
participation by the soviets at this years show 
we want to give you an idea of the level of soviet technology 
and the expertise of our pilots he said but we do not deny the 
commercial aspects and know there is a market for our aircraft 
the soviet officials said he expected his countrys space shuttle 
to be the star of the show 
he said buran which made its first unmanned flight last 
november has commercial possibilities as a satellite launcher 
however he said his government will continue launching its 
satellites with rockets 
burans next flight is to be in 1991 he said

opec ministers struck a deal wednesday 
night to restrain production in order to keep bolstering oil prices 
but crude futures tumbled in us trading on indications that some 
nations would continue cheating 
the accord signed by all 13 members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries in the sixth day of sometimestense 
bargaining lifts opecs official production ceiling to 195 million 
barrels a day in the julydecember period from the 185 million 
barrels in effect for januaryjune 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark us crude closed down 79 cents 
at 1967 a barrel 
opec is limiting production in an attempt to support a price of 
18 a 42gallon barrel in the last half of the year 
analysts say opec has been pumping an estimated 21 million 
barrels a day in recent weeks so the producing nations would have 
to curb output to meet the new supply level 
everybody is supposed to rein in production levels said opec 
president rilwanu lukman 
if they do analysts say crude prices and gasoline prices at the 
pump should hold steady 
at their final strategy session the ministers agreed that a 
special committee would meet in september to review the oil market 
if it is found that the demand warrants an increase in the 
ceiling then this can be raised to 20 million barrels per day or 
any other level agreed upon read a statement released by the 
ministers any adjustments would take effect oct 1 
under the accord the 1 million barrel increase in the production 
ceiling will be distributed proportionately among all members 
talks had stalled tuesday over kuwaits demand for a greater 
share of any increase in the ceiling and some kuwaiti delegates 
indicated that nation did not accept its new quota 
lukman asked about kuwaits position told a news conference 
kuwait signed the resolution 
but kuwaiti oil minister ali khalifa alsabah later told 
reporters he had made a reservation to the agreement he said he 
would give details on thursday 
a kuwaiti delegate who demanded anonymity said his government 
doesnt feel bound by the quota assigned it under the new accord 
another kuwaiti delegate who also sought anonymity said sabah 
wrote those reservations in the margin of the agreement signed by 
the ministers 
kuwait has been pumping well over its opec quota if it continues 
doing so it would add to the world supply and possibly help weaken 
prices 
the united arab emirates also has persistently produced more than 
its ceiling there was no indication whether it intended to adhere 
to its new target although a kuwaiti delegate said the uae 
verbally expressed its reservations in the closed meeting 
prices have risen from nearterm lows reached in late 1988 
partly due to opec cutbacks earlier in the year and to accidents 
that temporarily disrupted supplies in key oilproducing regions of 
the world 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
exceeded the 18 a barrel reference earlier in the year and prices 
are up more than 40 percent since last november 
in its insistence on a greater share of the increase kuwait was 
pitted against influential saudi arabia the worlds largest crude 
exporters 
saudi arabias hisham nazer walked out of the opec meeting 
handinhand with sabah in an apparent attempt to signal their 
differences were patched up 
nazer said several times during the bargaining that he wanted to 
see prices rising 
kuwait however is concerned that higher prices will erode the 
cartels share of the oil market to nonopec countries analysts 
say higher prices encourage more production and more exploration by 
producers 
the ministers statement said they intend to talk to independent 
producing nations with a view to soliciting their cooperation in 
support of market stability 
some of those countries agreed earlier in the year to curtail 
their output some to help bolster prices 
under the agreement saudi arabias new quota will be 48 million 
barrels a day up from 45 million barrels 
iran and iraq will have quotas of 28 million barrels a day up 
from 26 million barrels in the januaryjune period 
other quotas for the julydecember period are algeria 733000 
barrels per day ecuador 242000 barrels gabon 175000 and 
indonesia 13 million barrels 
others included kuwait 11 million barrels libya 11 million 
barrels nigeria 14 million barrels qatar 329000 barrels 
united arab emirates 1 million barrels and venezuela 17 million 
barrels

petroleum futures prices skidded wednesday 
despite opecs decision to restrain crude oil production more than 
the market had expected 
the contract for july delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil dropped 79 cents to 1967 a 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange following 
tuesdays decline of 6 cents 
the selloff was most severe in the wholesale home heating oil 
pits the july contract for no 2 heating oil settled at 4871 cents 
a gallon a loss of 229 cents on the day 
among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange 
unleaded gasoline for july delivery fell 160 cents to 6334 cents a 
gallon 
madison galbraith an energy specialist with merrill lynch energy 
futures said the market reacted skeptically to the agreement 
announced by the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
the cartels ministers meeting in vienna decided to raise 
opecs production ceiling to 195 million barrels a day for the july 
to december period the current output cap of 185 million barrels 
daily expires at the end of this month 
the agreement retains the cartels benchmark price of 18 a 
barrel for the last half of the year 
but the opec ministers apparently didnt come up with a solution 
to the problem of members exceeding their selfimposed output 
quotas the cartel has been pumping an estimated 21 million barrels 
a day in recent weeks energy analysts say 
the market told opec today we dont believe in you we 
dont believe your numbers said galbraith 
the market initially displayed some strength when it was 
announced that the new opec production ceiling was lower than the 20 
million to 21 million barrels a day some analysts had anticipated 
but doubts about opecs ability to abide by its accord created an 
opportunity for traders to sell and collect profits selling was 
dominated by large commercial energy brokers galbraith said

when martin s davis took over gulf amp western 
inc six years ago he had a vision for the conglomerate that 
manufactured bedding products and clothes turned out airplane 
pistons and produced books and motion pictures 
davis a corporate product of gulf amp westerns paramount 
pictures focused on the companys highlysuccessful entertainment 
and publishing businesses and began to systematically pare almost 
all its other segments 
now his sights have fallen on another media giant time inc 
paramount communications inc which gulf amp western became after 
changing its name on monday offered late tuesday to buy time for 
107 billion 
in a recent advertisement announcing its new name paramount 
communications described itself as a leader in entertainment and 
publishing and a global communications company 
time with holdings like timelife books home box office and 
american television and communications corp would fit right in 
with simon amp schuster and prentice hall part of paramounts 
publishing division and its paramount pictures and television units 
it also would fit with martin davis vision of what his company 
should be 
we will have unequaled strength in quality magazine and book 
publishing as well as in motion picture and television production 
and distribution cable systems and cable programming he said 
about a timeparamount combination in a news release 
davis who did not respond to a request for an interview 
wednesday became chairman of gulf amp western in 1983 upon the death 
of charles g bluhdorn the conglomerate then embraced a wide 
variety of businesses sugar zinc chemicals energy products race 
tracks kayserroth apparel and hosiery simmons bedding and 
automotive electronic and construction products 
almost immediately he announced a restructuring plan for the 
company saying it had become too unwieldy and could not gain the 
maximum profits possible from its many assets 
between the fiscal year that began in august 1982 and early 1987 
gulf amp western disposed of more than 50 operations and reduced its 
number of major business segments from nine to three financial 
services entertainment and publishing 
the company which once ran a large stock portfolio also gave up 
investing in other businesses 
the restructuring slashed the companys annual revenue which 
fell from 642 billion before the restructuring to 378 billion in 
the year ended oct 31 1986 but boosted profits in the same 
period to 2674 million from 1686 million 
in its most recent fiscal year ended oct 31 1988 the company 
reported revenue of 51 billion and income of 3847 million 
the businesses it kept were prominent and successful paramount 
pictures for instance has had some of the biggest movie hits in 
recent years beverly hills cop crocodile dundee and the 
star trek and raiders of the lost ark series 
earlier this year davis announced a further honing of his 
company gulf amp western said it would sell the associates the 
nations thirdlargest consumer finance company and get out of 
financial services altogether 
its not surprising davis would have taken the company down the 
path to becoming a communications conglomerate he began working for 
paramount pictures in 1958 as director of sales and marketing later 
moving up to vice president of the companys home office 
by all accounts he is an aggressive and determined executive in 
1984 he set out to acquire prenticehall the bid was initially 
rejected but davis won the publisher paying 710 million 
he appears equally adamant about winning time his 175pershare 
offer was nearly 40 percent higher than times closing price tuesday 
of 126 a share 
davis was undaunted by times proposed merger with warner 
communications inc saying time essentially put itself up for sale 
by agreeing to merge with warner

copper futures prices rose sharply wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange on speculation that labor contract negotiations 
at major us copper producers will be accompanied by strikes 
on other futures markets precious metals were mixed grain and 
soybean prices fell livestock and meat prices were higher and 
energy futures declined 
copper rallied on word that officials of magma copper inc 
expected labor contract talks to be difficult and expected a strike 
copper settled 225 cents to 245 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in june at 10885 a pound 
supply concerns were fueled by reports that bougainville copper 
ltds supply contracts were delayed by the shutdown of its papua 
new guinea mine said john oconnell an analyst with refco inc in 
new york the mine has been damaged by attacks from native rebel 
landowners 
oconnell said the rise in copper prices also could be attributed 
partly to a comeback from a selloff spurred by the turmoil in china 
the nation is a big copper importer and traders reacted to the 
upheaval there with a big selloff tuesday due to speculation the 
troubles would disrupt commerce and industry there 
the markets are beginning to believe that the liquidation was 
overdone oconnell said 
precious metal prices closed mixed on new yorks commodity 
exchange following a runup of as much as 13 an ounce for gold on 
thursday silver continued the price rise that began tuesday as the 
dollar showed weakness 
gold was 240 to 380 lower with june at 37610 a troy ounce 
silver was 33 cents to 36 cents higher with june at 5464 a troy 
ounce

oil ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries meeting in vienna agreed to boost output to 195 million 
barrels a day for the last half of the year up 1 million barrels a 
day from the current ceiling 
the ceiling is not high enough said robert baker an analyst 
wtih prudentialbache securities inc in new york how many 
nations will overproduce to get to higher level the market just

of trade 
there is some doubt among traders that the 185 million metric 
tons of wheat sold to china which was announced earlier this week 
will be shipped or paid for said ted mao an analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york 
corn prices were down despite the announcement tuesday of the 
sale of 300000 metric tons of corn to the soviet union 
forecasts for drier weather are expected to promote soybean 
planting in eastern crop areas while wetter weather in other areas

an energy company has agreed to pay a 
reported 275 million to eight families who discovered in 1987 that 
their homes sat atop a toxic waste dump officials said wednesday 
the settlement was announced at a meeting attended by the 
families local officials mediators who helped construct the deal 
and representatives of colonial gas co which once dumped on the 
site 
colonial gas acknowledged its coalgasification byproducts were 
dumped decades ago where the families homes were later built 
railroad debris leather hospital bandages bottles light 
bulbs drums metal paint cans ash paint dye and rubber shoe 
scraps were among the waste dumped at the site when it was known as 
costas dump from the 1920s to 40s 
the families reported seeing blue soil and camphorlike odors in 
1987 to the state department of environmental quality engineering 
under the settlement colonial gas will buy the homes pay 
damages and finance the continuing cleanup costs at the site near 
the concord river in this city about 35 miles north of boston 
the agreement will provide each family with approximately 
250000 the parties said colonial gas reportedly also has agreed 
to pay 750000 to the deqe for the testing and fencing and cleaning 
the site 
colonial gas attorney ralph child the cleanup would not begin for 
at least a year he said the houses either will be razed 
transported to another location or left on the site during cleanup 
as a provision of the agreement the families will not be allowed 
to seek further damages for future health problems 
in a report the deqe found the site does not currently pose an 
immediate threat to the health or welfare of abutters to the 
property 
but it said the area was unsafe to live on and remedial actions 
were necessary to ensure the protection of the families and future 
users of the site 
the families whose members complained about health problems 
including headaches and asthma were reolcated together to a 
condominium complex in another town the mediation took six months

a sewing machine company that closed its 
massachusetts plant in 1981 has been ordered to rehire the entire 
workforce and make up eight years of lost earnings for up to 190 
employees officials said wednesday 
jubilant workers hailed the decision by the national labor 
relations board as vindication of their claim that the company 
reece corp of waltham moved operations to maine and overseas to 
escape a costly union contract 
maybe this will show people that unions hang on and defend 
people were not just dues collectors said vincent c ofria 
president of the 2000member local 1596 of the united auto workers 
which represented the reece employees 
its not clear what how much total back pay might be owed the 
nlrb must hold a separate hearing to determine that 
labor lawyers said the decision did not chart new legal ground 
but appeared to mark a shift from the nlrbs decisions under former 
president reagan when the board steadily strengthened management 
rights at the expense of unions 
peter j abate reeces president and chief executive officer 
said the company would appeal the order which could cost it 
millions of dollars in court 
the exact amount of back pay remains to be determined through a 
separate nlrb hearing joel gardiner an attorney in the nlrbs 
boston office said the hearing wont be held until after the 
companys appeal 
reece a 108yearold firm that had sales of 595 million last 
year announced in april 1981 it would close the plant which made 
industrial machinery for sewing buttonholes and pockets 
approximately 190 workers were laid off and the operations were 
transferred to plants in gorham maine and leiden the netherlands 
a threemember nlrb panel issued its decision in washington on 
may 31 but it was not received by the parties until this week 
by a 21 vote the panel overturned a 1982 decision by an 
administrative law judge who had found that the company had a 
contractual right to shut the plant 
the nlrb interpreted the contract more narrowly ruling that 
neither a managementrights clause nor a paragraph covering 
severance pay eliminated the companys obligation to bargain with 
the union over the plants future 
by refusing to bargain collectively and in good faith with the 
union the company has engaged in unfair labor practices nlrb 
chairman james m stephens and board member mary miller cracraft 
wrote 
the nlrb ordered reece to make up any difference between what the 
workers have earned over the past eight years and what they would 
have earned at the plant 
workers at the reece plant earned an average of more than 9 an 
hour and many who were paid at piece rates made more than 14 an 
hour 
the company also was required to offer the waltham employees 
immediate reinstatement to their former jobs and if those jobs no 
longer exist to equivalent positions at the companys other plants 
the board said the company would have to pay the workers moving 
costs and if necessary make jobs for them by dismissing employees 
hired after the plant closing 
the nlrb did not explain why it took nearly seven years to decide 
the case however lawyers said the board has been struggling with a 
significant backlog and delays of three years or longer are common 
the dissenting board member wilford w johansen argued the uaw 
had waived its right to bargain over the plants future by agreeing 
to put the managementrights and severance pay clauses in the 
contract 
alan h shapiro a boston labor lawyer called the decision a 
good precedent from a union perspective 
it sounds like this kind of a decision in which the board is 
not willing to buy into a waiverbycontract argument is shifting 
away from the reagan years when they found waivers in everything 
shapiro said

metropolitan property and casualty insurance 
co announced wednesday it would buy ohiobased jc penney casualty 
insurance co which the retailing giant had said it wanted to 
unload 
the price was undisclosed we dont anticipate it being a 
significant loss or gain for us said j duncan muir a spokesman 
for j c penney co at the retailers texas headquarters 
the casualty insurance subsidiary headquartered in westerville 
ohio lost 7 million on premiums of 168 million last year about 
80 percent of it in auto insurance muir said it had about 350000 
policies in force 
metropolitan property and casualty a subsidiary of metropolitan 
life insurance co of new york earned 40 million on premium income 
of 543 million last year it had 11 million policies said 
spokeswoman liz ostrowski 
jc penney will keep its life insurance subsidiary muir said 
unlike rival sears roebuck and co penney had been unable to 
produce a satisfactory package of financial services to sell through 
its stores muir said 
the direction of our company is to become a department store 
we found that people did not choose to make financial decisions at 
the same time they were shopping for apparel he said 
ms ostrowski said metropolitan would probably keep penneys 
overthecounter insurance sales force in place for up to 18 months 
after the expected closing of the sale later this summer then fold 
those operations into metropolitans existing sales force of agents 
directmarketing specialists and century 21 real estate agents 
less certain was the future of 770 employees at penney casualtys 
headquarters in suburban columbus metropolitan would keep a service 
center there but staffing levels had not been decided ms 
ostrowski said 
metropolitan which writes most of its business in the northeast 
wants to expand to the midwest and south ms ostrowski said penney 
casualty wrote nearly half its premiums in 1987 in ohio and 
california with other significant amounts in pennsylvania and 
georgia according to am best co an industry rating service 
best gave penneys insurance operations a bplus rating last 
year which one expert said is generally the lowest rating accepted 
by insurance brokers metropolitan improved from bplus to aminus

debts of the third world to commercial banks 
dropped by 124 billion last year partly because banks used the 
money to buy local assets according to new figures from the 
international monetary fund 
the fund did not give totals in its monthly imf memorandum 
distributed this week or the debts of individual countries it 
classes 130 countries in the third world as developing 
according to the world bank its sister organization third world 
debt now comes to 13 trillion michel camdessus the funds 
managing director said banks hold about 60 percent of it most of 
the rest is owed to governments and intergovernment bodies such as 
the fund itself 
both organizations owned by the same 151 governments have 
pledged to help reduce the debt further as urged by treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady they are pressing private banks to go 
along by forgiving some of the debt in return for assurances that 
interest will be paid promptly on what is left 
there was a drop of 173 billion in the amount owed by the 15 
countries singled out as specially troubled by secretary of state 
james a baker iii when he was secretary of the treasury in 1985 
the world bank calculates that they owe about 520 billion they 
include argentina and venezuela where price rises linked to debt 
have brought bloody rioting recently 
according to the fund the reduction in the debt owed to the 
banks is not due to repayments but to other operations 
the banks disposed of 87 billion worth by using what the fund 
calls official conversions these include conversion of the debt 
from dollars or other hard currency into the money of the debtor 
country and then buying shares of stock in local industry 
chile has taken the lead in these debtequity swaps in 
mexico brazil and other countries the swaps have been criticized as 
contributing both to inflation and to the sale of too many important 
assets to foreigners 
the banks also sold off at a discount debts with a face value of 
8 billion some third world debt brings as little as 10 cents on 
the dollar in the market after a sale the debtor country still 
owes the full face value to the new purchaser but nothing to the 
bank 
in addition to the 15 more than 100 other third world countries 
are classified by the fund as developing in 1987 the debts of 
all of them to the banks increased by 187 billion 
debtor countries complain mostly about the burden of interest 
payments camdessus reported last week that debtors fell another 11 
billion behind on their payments in 1988 these are largely interest 
payments since few debtors have paid back much principal since 1982

lawsuit opposing the postponement of prime computer incs annual 
meeting where it plans to wage a proxy battle for control of the 
company

on june 1 mai cut its bid to 1950 in cash for about 75 percent 
of the shares on a fully diluted basis plus securities with a face
