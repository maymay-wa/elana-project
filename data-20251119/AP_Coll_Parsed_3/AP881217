his cabinet with the selection of former texas sen john tower as 
defense secretary and he now is focusing on candidates to run the 
governments housing health and transportation agencies 
trying to wrap up major appointments before christmas bush is 
expected to announce at least three more cabinet choices early next 
week

secretary of housing and urban development and chicago masstransit 
official samuel skinner as secretary of transportation sources 
involved in the transition said friday 
they also said health educator louis sullivan continues to be the 
leading candidate for secretary of health and human services but had 
not been offered the job if chosen he would be the first black in 
bushs cabinet 
moreover former republican rep henson moore of louisiana was 
said by sources to be a leading candidate to become energy secretary 
sources also reported bush had chosen oklahoma gov henry bellmon 
and former democratic rep thomas lud ashley of ohio to be his 
appointees to the national economic commission which is charged 
with recommending ways to reduce the federal deficit bellmon is a 
former senator who once served as ranking republican on the budget 
committee while ashley has been a friend of the presidentelect 
since their days together at yale 
in naming tower to the pentagon bush said friday he was 
totally satisfied with towers fitness to serve after a detailed 
fbi background check into his connections with the defense industry 
as well as with allegations of womanizing and drinking problems 
tower commenting on the allegations said i got up every 
morning and laughed myself silly over what i was reading in the 
newspapers 
bush predicting the selection would be greeted with wide 
support abroad and at home said he believed tower had been 
strengthened by the ordeal he said the exhaustive investigation 
into towers professional and personal life had yielded a clean 
bill of health 
after announcing the choice of tower bush fielded questions from 
reporters 
he said that there is no expectation that we will or wont 
have a summit meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
next year he said he didnt want to signal unwillingness to build 
on recent progress in ussoviet relations but also didnt want to 
send out the other signal of acting too hastily 
bush also said he wouldnt overstate the importance of the 
us talks with the palestine liberation organization that opened 
friday in tunisia he stressed that the reagan administration has 
embarked on a dialogue and not a negotiation 
tower was the seventh cabinet member named by bush leaving seven 
slots still unfilled 
tower said that in running the pentagon he would have to produce 
as much if not more defense for less money 
tower hinted at manpower reductions throughout the armed 
services but he stressed i would not advocate for the 
immediate future any significant troop reduction in europe 
the appointment completes bushs selection of a national security 
team he previously named former treasury secretary james a baker 
iii as secretary of state chose retired air force gen brent 
scowcroft as national security adviser and said he would retain 
william webster as director of the central intelligence agency 
tower has held a variety of sensitive posts since retiring from 
the senate in 1985 including stints as an arms control negotiator 
for president reagan and as head of a review board popularly known 
as the tower commission appointed by reagan to probe the 
irancontra affair 
some conservative critics have contended that towers support for 
the reagan administrations star wars plan for a land and 
spacebased shield against missiles has been lukewarm 
tower told reporters that i dont have any reservations about 
the strategic defense initiative however he added i understand 
the value of sdi not just as a deterrent potential but also as a 
very very valuable negotiating tool 
asked if that meant he thought of it only as a bargaining chip 
for armsreduction talks he responded not a chip leverage 
negotiating leverage 
in another development a transition source said campaign 
strategist robert teeter who is serving as cochairman of bushs 
transition team has ended many days of deliberation and decided to 
go to the white house as deputy chief of staff

a vietnam war veteran has been selected as lead 
trial prosecutor in the irancontra case against fellow former 
marine and exwhite house aide oliver l north 
john w keker 44 who like north was wounded while leading a 
marine infantry platoon in action was chosen on friday by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh to head a threelawyer team 
that will try north 
walsh had said he would like to try the north case himself but 
he said in a statement friday that he would continue to deal with 
problems posed by a wealth of classified documents and supervise the 
continuing investigation of the irancontra affair 
walshs spokesman james wieghart said kekers war record which 
was not mentioned in the statement was coincidental to his being 
named head of the prosecution team 
but kekers purple heart for his combat wound is a serendipitous 
qualification for the lead prosecutor in the case against north who 
has made patriotism and his own vietnam service a hallmark of his 
public defense since the irancontra affair unfolded two years ago 
north 44 who earned two purple hearts for combat wounds wore 
his marine uniform when he testified before the congressional 
committees that investigated the armsforhostages deals 
walsh announced his courtroom team in advance of a hearing next 
wednesday by us district judge gerhard a gesell to begin final 
preparations for norths trial which could begin as early as late 
january 
the former national security council aide who retired from the 
marines as a lieutenant colonel following his indictment last march 
is accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits from the 
usiran arms deals to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
keker who is on leave from his san francisco law firm will be 
joined by associate independent counsels david a zornow 33 and 
michael w bromwich 34 both former federal prosecutors in new york 
city 
zornow investigated and helped try several major municipal 
corruption cases in new york 
this commits three of our most experienced criminal lawyers to 
the case walsh said 
walsh repeatedly had expressed an interest in trying the case 
against north former national security adviser john m poindexter 
and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
but gesells decision to order separate trials for each of the 
defendants and the continuing complications of classified documents 
and congressional immunity given north poindexter and hakim forced 
a reexamination of those plans according to a source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
besides the original grand jury that indicted north and his 
codefendants a new panel began meeting this fall to consider 
possible perjury by participants in the irancontra affair 
walsh must be free to oversee the investigations and negotiate 
with intelligence agencies about disclosing classified information 
that gesell says must be included in the proof against north 
christian j mixter who has been handling the prosecutions case 
during closed proceedings on secret documents in the north case was 
named a member of the team of lawyers for poindexters trial 
keker joined the marine corps upon graduation from princeton 
university in 1965 and was commissioned a second lieutenant sent to 
vietnam in 1966 he was wounded while leading an infantry platoon 
near the demilitarized zone he left the marines in 1967 and studied 
law at yale university 
he later served as law clerk to retired supreme court chief 
justice earl warren

political maverick lyndon h larouche jr 
says his conviction of tax and mail fraud conspiracy is a wrong 
gross disgusting obscene miscarriage of justice and predicted 
he will die a martyrs death if sent to prison 
they dont want a living political martyr in prison they want 
a dead one said larouche claiming he was the victim of a hate 
campaign by the news media and a frameup by a prosoviet friends 
of glasnost clique in the justice and state departments 
larouche 66 a perennial fringe candidate for president told 
reporters he felt no remorse or sympathy for his followers many of 
them elderly people who had loaned his organization millions of 
dollars and gotten little or none of their money back 
they have been wronged not by us but by the government he 
said explaining that when several of his groups were forced into 
bankruptcy proceedings in april 1987 the government seized loan 
repayment funds 
after less than 12 hours of deliberation a federal trial jury on 
friday found larouche and six associates guilty of mail fraud and 
conspiracy for raising more than 30 million in loans from 
supporters without any intention of repaying them 
in addition larouche was convicted of scheming to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid by 
various corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable 
income government prosecutors said larouche has not filed federal 
income tax returns for any year since 1978 
chief us district judge albert v bryan jr set sentencing for 
jan 27 and allowed all seven defendants to remain free on their 
personal recognizance larouche faces a maximum penalty of 65 years 
in prison and fines totaling 325 million 
all seven were found guilty of all 48 counts contained in an 
indictment returned by a federal grand jury on oct 14 after a 
twoyear investigation of the larouche organizations financial 
affairs 
the six convicted larouche associates who face lesser maximum 
penalties are william wertz the leaders chief fundraiser edward 
spannaus legal coordinator for larouche and fundraisers michael 
billington paul greenberg joyce rubinstein and dennis small 
defense lawyers said they planned to appeal the convictions they 
repeatedly denied that larouche had sought to cheat federal tax 
collectors and insisted that his fundraisers had promised in good 
faith that the terms of the loans would be honored 
government prosecutors led by assistant us attorney kent 
robinson said the larouche people were lying when they solicited the 
loans with promises of prompt payment at preferred interest rates 
in 1986 they said larouche associates were making an estimated 
500000 in improvements to his heavily guarded leesburg va 
estate including a swimming pool and riding ring while they were 
defaulting on millions of dollars in loans from supporters 
larouche who did not testify during the fourweek trial in us 
district court stood erect facing the jury of eight women and four 
men as a clerk recited their guilty verdict on all 13 counts against 
him he sat down without a word or a gesture 
small nodded and smiled almost imperceptibly as he was convicted 
ms rubinstein broke into tears and fell into the arms of a woman 
friend after she left the courtroom 
assistant us attorney john markham of boston said he did not 
regard the outcome of the complex hardfought court case as a 
victory 
i consider this an obvious conclusion to a long pattern of 
false statements to trusting senior citizens he said their 
dreams for their retirement are gone its a sad case 
defense lawyer kenly webster who represented spannaus said the 
jurys decision probably was influenced by the size of the debt 
incurred and the failure to pay that debt back according to the 
terms and conditions 
the jurors probably felt it would be a long time before they 
would be paid back if at all webster said 
he speculated that the jury also was influenced by the very 
controversial views held by larouche and his supporters on 
political issues which seemed inextricably entwined with the 
defaulted loans issue 
the larouche movement embraces numerous unorthodox positions and 
relies heavily on conspiratorial theories to explain world events 
some adherents have advocated quarantining aids victims others have 
alleged that former secretary of state henry kissinger and britains 
queen elizabeth are involved in conspiracies 
at a news conference held in his alexandria apartment suite 
shortly after the verdict was announced larouche said he himself 
was the victim of a conspiracy conceived by leftist government 
opponents promoted by liberal dupes in the news media and carried 
to a climax friday by a runaway jury with no regard for 
facts 
larouche said he was convinced that his conviction is tantamount 
to a death sentence at the hands of fellow prison inmates 
the way the jury voted im dead he said adding that the 
governments goal was not to put me in prison but to kill me 
larouche said he will leave behind the legacy of an international 
antibolshevik resistance led by followers who are prepared to 
fight and die to save civilization from world conquest by the 
communists 
we will kill and die if necessary to restore the kind of 
government the founders of this country fought to create he said 
larouche said he and his followers are not afraid to die we 
are not a bunch of sentimental slush heads he said 
a separate criminal case involving larouche is scheduled for 
retrial in boston starting feb 27 in that case larouche six 
aides and five of his organizations are charged with conspiring to 
obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that 
more than 2 million was raised for larouches 1984 presidential 
campaign through credit card and loan fraud

presidentelect bush has turned for his defense 
secretary to a former senator who strongly backed the military 
buildup of the reagan years and worked as a consultant for major 
military contractors after leaving congress 
john tower a 63yearold texan retired from the senate in 1985 
after 24 years including a stint as chairman of the armed services 
committee 
after leaving the senate tower went into business as a defense 
consultant he also has served as an arms negotiator for president 
reagan and he headed the white houses irancontra investigative 
panel 
he was widely mentioned as a candidate for the defense department 
job by most accounts the only one he really wanted under reagan 
but reagan never made the move 
tower comes to the job now at a time when the pentagon faces 
acute budget pressures because of the federal budget deficit and the 
array of costly new weapons systems developed as part of the 
military buildup 
the bottom line is that we must provide at least as much if 
not more defense for less money tower said after bush announced 
his nomination friday 
the announcement followed a lengthy background check that brought 
a public airing of towers private life including an acrimonious 
divorce talk of drinking and womanizing and questions about the 
propriety of naming someone to the job who had worked with so many 
defense companies 
bush dismissed a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless 
and said i am totally satisfied in that regard 
the presidentelect apparently decided that towers extensive 
financial ties to weapons companies that he will do business with as 
defense secretary was not a bar to service 
asked if tower would stay out of defense department matters 
involving corporations for whom he has consulted bush said i 
expect so but i dont know i expect he would just like anybody 
coming in i think well bend over backward in that regard 
according to public records and associates towers consulting 
firm of tower and associates has been on annual retainer with the 
following defense contractors martinmarietta textron ltv 
aerospace and defense co rockwell international and british 
aerospace 
in addition towers firm received about 100000 a year under a 
contract for consulting services to hicks and associates a mclean 
vabased aerospace consulting firm headed by donald hicks a former 
undersecretary of defense 
through hicks firm tower indirectly provided advice to still 
more defense contractors 
towers firm received 96000 a year from ltv although other 
fees were not revealed an associate richard billmire acknowledged 
some were in the range of 100000 a year 
there are some retainers in the neighborhood of that figure 
and others that are substantially less billmire said 
tower also received income from speeches about 15000 each for 
the 30 or so a year he gives according to his agent joe cosby 
he has a second consulting firm dallasbased tower eggers and 
greene which is described as providing financial services and 
advice 
tower was a former board member of a dallas bank first republic 
with his dallas firm tower was part of a group that unsuccessfully 
bid to buy the financially troubled bank before it was taken over by 
north carolinabased ncnb corp 
billmire described towers work for the defense contractors as 
providing advice on the direction of future defense projects and 
advice and information on government budget processes including the 
transfer of money among projects 
hicks said he signed a contract for towers services in order to 
gain the benefit of his advice and opinions about what congress was 
likely to do on defense issues 
in the senate tower was a supporter of reagans strategic 
defense initiative and the mx missile but he was said to be angered 
by the administrations failure to agree on a missile deployment 
plan and he moved to block development until an acceptable plan was 
found 
tower left the arms negotiating post after 14 months and in late 
1986 reagan named him to head his irancontra investigative panel 
its report laid part of the blame for affair on reagans management 
style but had little to say about bushs involvement 
in naming tower bush was bringing a fellow texan to the upper 
levels of his administration tower was the first republican elected 
to the senate from texas since reconstruction he is a native of 
houston and was a college professor before running for the senate 
he was elected in 1961 in a special election to fill lyndon 
johnsons seat after johnson became vice president

as a former senator john tower will receive a 
certain deference at his confirmation hearing as george bushs new 
defense chief but he may also face serious questioning about his 
willingness to shoehorn pentagon spending into a newly limited 
budget 
i would say john tower will be accorded special respect but no 
special privilege said sen john warner rva the senior 
republican on the senate armed services committee 
warner told reporters he had consulted with committee chairman 
sam nunn dga and that hearings on towers nomination would 
probably take place the week of jan 20 he said while tower would 
undergo careful questioning he ultimately will be confirmed 
the day after the senate confirms him hell move into harness 
and step out warner said hell require no onthejob 
training 
nunn in a statement said the confirmation hearings would focus 
on towers plans for meeting defense challenges over the next four 
years including who will be appointed to senior pentagon jobs how 
congressionally mandated reforms will be put in place and how 
security will be maintained in a time of tight budgets 
some of those who will sit in judgment on tower when he goes 
before the committee were there when tower chaired the panel during 
the first four years of the reagan administration 
it will be a love feast predicted frank gaffney a former 
top pentagon official now at the center for security policy a 
conservative washington research organization 
hes tough hes shrewd hes smart said one of those former 
colleagues sen gordon humphrey rnh hes not likely to be 
hoodwinked by the soviets he is certainly well prepared in terms of 
expertise and experience 
one issue likely to emerge during the confirmation hearings is 
how the nomination of melvyn r paisley the former navy assistant 
secretary who is a central figure in the pentagon procurement 
scandal got past tower when he chaired the committee 
tower has said his panel never was given access to an fbi 
background report on paisley that contained damaging allegations and 
might have kept paisley from getting the senior job committee 
member sen carl levin dmich has asked president reagan to 
explain why those allegations never surfaced in 1981 when paisley 
was nominated 
the long fbi background check on tower and talk about bushs 
reported desire to put a strong manager in as towers 
secondincommand have weakened the new nominee said rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo she said that will make him more open to attack 
for coziness with the defense industry 
you have a new secretary who never saw a weapons system he 
didnt like schroeder a member of the house armed services 
committee told reporters he is tainted in being able to run a 
tough aggressive pentagon 
over his career this is not somebody who has staked out a 
reputation as a tough budgetcutting six guntoting decision 
maker said gordon adams defense director of the center on budget 
and policy priorities an independent analysis group 
in the early 1980s while chairman of the committee he signed 
off on the biggest peacetime buildup in defense since the end of 
world war ii he defended it he pushed it through adams said 
the mission today is very different he said its how do 
you get defense spending under control hes got to be a guy whos 
learned how to say no and ive not seen that in his past 
lawrence korb another former pentagon official now at the 
brookings institution a liberal research organization said tower 
will face a severe test the question is whether he will be able 
to put together the team that can take a 400 billion program and 
put it into a 300 billion budget korb said 
gaffney however said towers role should be to advocate 
pentagon spending and fight against cuts 
tower is not going to have to prove anything except that he has 
the wisdom and tenacity to minimize the damage done to national 
security by people trying to effect draconian cuts in the defense 
budget gaffney said

catholic university administrators were wrong 
to have allowed the vatican to influence their decision to suspend 
an ordained priest from the schools theology department a notre 
dame university professor has testified 
the church does not have a juridical role in the academic 
world because academic freedom is ultimately left to peer 
judgment said richard p mcbrien chairman of notre dames theology 
department 
he testified at a nonjury trial friday in support of the rev 
charles e curran who in a suit against catholic university 
contends his january 1987 suspension violated his academic freedom 
currans disagreement with church teachings on homosexuality 
birth control and other positions were pubished in his book 
faithful dissent afterward vatican officials revoked currans 
canonical mission to teach catholic theology curran sued 
catholic university after it suspended him from its theology 
department on grounds that his writings were at odds with the faith 
cardinal james a hickey archibishop of washington and 
chancellor of the university testified on thursday that the vatican 
had the authority to decide when an ordained priest no longer spoke 
for the church 
hickey testified that in suspending curran he was enforcing the 
vaticans order 
curran had taught at the school for 22 years 
catholic university was founded in 1885 as one of a few 
pontifical universities directly governed by the church 
in his testimony friday mcbrien said catholic universitys 
theological department which had been held in high regard in recent 
years now enjoys less respect from the us academic community in 
part because of the curran suspension 
cardinal joseph bernardin the former chairman of the board of 
trustees of catholic university testified thursday that the 
university was compelled by the vaticans action against curran to 
suspend him from the theology department 
if we were to directly defy the holy see the school risked 
having its charter revoked said bernardin who is now the 
archbishop of chicago 
the trial continues on monday but lawyers representing both 
sides said a list of witnesses was being negotiated and had not been 
finalized

the american civil liberties union filed a lawsuit 
against the city friday accusing housing officials of systematic 
warrantless searches of tenants and their visitors in an effort to 
crack down on drug selling 
chicago housing authority officials later agreed to relax some of 
the security rules but the lawsuit was not withdrawn from us 
district court said agency spokeswoman katie kelly 
the lawsuit stems from a security crackdown by the housing 
agency which is trying to evict squatters and violent gang members 
who use the projects as havens for drug deals 
the lawsuit seeks to stop searches of tenants and their 
apartments and to establish reasonable regulations on visits by 
family members and other guests 
under the existing regulations all guests of residents in the 
building have to sign in with the guard at the front door and show a 
piece of valid identification ms kelly said 
the policy has been that guests are asked to leave the building 
at midnight and are not allowed in until 9 am she said 
no overnight guests are allowed unless the tenant has received 
prior approval 
the lawsuit says housing officials and police have 
indiscriminately detained and searched tenants persons and homes 
going through drawers closets personal effects and other items 
these searches have been carried out without the consent of the 
tenants and any prior notice if tenants object they have been 
threatened with arrest the aclu said in a statement 
the lawsuit cites the case of a tenant who was forced to find 
another babysitter for her sisters children after housing officials 
ordered the children out of her apartment at midnight 
under the new rules the guest upon entry will identify him or 
herself to cha personnel but will not need a piece of 
identification although the tenant must confirm that the person is 
a guest ms kelly said 
overnight visitors would be issued guest cards and residents 
could have longterm guests for a period of up to two weeks 
ms kelly said the aclu planned to present the proposals to the 
plaintiffs and planned further discussions with the city 
our intent in all our security procedures is to provide for the 
safety and welfare of our residents and that will continue to be our 
objective she said 
the defendants are the housing agency the city and police 
superintendent leroy martin

singer frank sinatra says he feels like hes on 
the right track when he gets to spend time playing with his 250 
model trains 
the noise of the trains running and whistling can get pretty 
loud but watching the trains just removes my head from thinking 
about work ol blue eyes said in this weekends edition of usa 
weekend magazine 
when sinatra was an 11yearold boy growing up in hoboken nj 
he desperately wanted a train set but i didnt know how my family 
could ever afford it sinatra said 
one day my mother pawned her fox fur piece to buy my first 
train set a windup engine and an oval track i never forgot that 
it was probably the only decent thing she had to wear and i was old 
enough to understand the sacrifice 
so now at his rancho mirage calif home sinatra has an 
18by30 train station with the 250 model traincars five trains can 
run simultaneously on independent loops running through hoboken or 
an old west town and passing by a new orleans riverboat with a 
billboard announcing a soldout sinatra concert

social security commissioner dorcas r hardy 
says many of the millions of people who flooded her agency with 
phone calls last summer for a new personalized benefit statement 
have not yet taken the trouble to complete the application 
more than 6 million people have asked us for the statement but 
only 35 percent of them have sent it back to us hardy told 
reporters friday its still hanging on their refrigerators 
the social security administration had trouble fielding all the 
phone calls requesting its personal earnings and benefit estimate 
statement pebes when it became available in august 
but hardy said the bottleneck on the phone lines has been cleared 
and were ready willing and able to provide them now i would 
really like to have everybody have a pebes in their stocking 
the tollfree number to call is 18002345772 
operators are on hand to answer the calls at various social 
security centers from 7 am to 7 pm local time on weekdays those 
who call after working hours or on weekends will get a recording 
capable of taking messages 
once the form is mailed back it takes the agency three weeks to 
crank out the estimates of future monthly retirement benefits as 
well as how much a worker and family gets if he or she becomes 
disabled or dies 
the agency also provides a yearbyyear list of workers wages 
and social security taxes 
in other matters hardy said she and the department of health and 
human services were unable to get included in president reagans 
fiscal 1990 budget a proposal to eliminate a social securitys 
earnings test 
the earnings test reduces benefits of beneficiaries under age 70 
who earn more than certain amounts the thresholds this year are 
8400 for those ages 6569 and 6120 for those under 65 in 1989 
they are 8880 and 6480 respectively 
she also said im hearing from seniors at town hall meetings 
that they are not pleased about the income tax surtax thats 
coming to pay for medicares new catastrophic insurance benefit 
hardy said she wouldnt be surprised if congress took another 
look at whether to levy the 15 percent tax surcharge on the elderly 
to pay for the insurance which starts in january 
hardy wants all 130 million american workers to request their 
earnings records at least once every three years both to ensure 
their wages were reported correctly and to get a better idea of 
what to expect from social security upon retirement 
hardy hopes that people armed with that information will save 
more and rely less on the government for their retirement income 
currently more than half the elderly rely on social security as 
their main source of income but the program was always intended 
just to be part of retirement income she said

a federal panel is calling for restrictions on 
alcohol advertising and higher state and federal excise taxes in an 
effort to reduce drunken driving by discouraging alcohol consumption 
surgeon general c everett koop accepted an inchthick packet of 
recommendations friday at the close of a threeday workshop he 
convened and he vowed to use his high public profile to publicize 
the report 
while stopping short of urging an outright ban of beer wine and 
liquor advertising the panel said such ads should not be allowed on 
college campuses since a high proportion of audience reached is 
under the legal drinking age 
koop told the workshop participants that his office had little 
money or power to implement policy but promised to provide startup 
funds for a nonprofit private corporation to serve as a 
clearinghouse for groups seeking ammunition to use in the war on 
drunken driving 
koop said that for his part he intends to be an aggressive but 
not shrill soldier 
i intend to ignore those who would lynch or execute a first 
offender in drunk driving just as i will ignore those who would say 
it has not yet been proven that alcohol is responsible for impaired 
driving koop told the workshop 
i intend to pursue whatever leadership role i may have between 
these two extremes as i have with other issues and to transmit to 
that leadership whatever energy enthusiasm and credibility i have 
in this war against impaired driving 
the panels other recommendations called for 
elimination of alcohol advertising and promotion and sponsorship 
of public events where the majority of the audience is under the 
legal drinking age 
elimination of advertising that portrays activities that are 
combined with alcohol use 
banning of sponsorship of athletic events by the alcohol 
beverage industry 
blocking the use of celebrities who have a strong appeal to 
young people in alcohol advertising and promotion 
requiring that the warning labels congress recently voted to 
require on alcoholic containers also be required to appear clearly 
and conspicuously in all alcohol ads 
no specific monetary figures were contained in the section on 
taxes but the panelist said excise tax rates at both the federal 
and state level should be equalized among beer wine and liquor and 
indexed to rise automatically with inflation 
the advertising section was most controversial largely because 
the national association of broadcasters and the advertising 
industry had declined to participate in the workshop claiming it 
was stacked against advertisers interests 
in fact the research the ad industry provided the panel 
demonstrates that there is no existing evidence that links 
advertising and alcohol abuse said howard bell president of the 
american advertising federation in a statement friday 
nab president edward o fritts wrote koop last month at best 
this workshop is designed to politicize the emotional tragedy of 
drunk driving at worst it is a total abuse of the policysetting 
process 
koop who had not responded publicly to that charge lashed back 
at the end of his remarks friday 
i wanted everyone to hear the nabs point of view not only 
because broadcasters are very influential but because they also 
have so much at stake in this issue he said hence they 
certainly have the right to be here 
koop said he felt the criticism of the workshop was unfair and 
said he was taken aback by what he called fritts unfortunate 
choice of words

president reagan said in the last major foreign 
policy speech of his presidency that america no longer enjoys 
preponderant power in the world 
as a result reagan said his oval office successors and the 
congress must not treat each other as adversaries but must work 
more cooperatively if the united states is to be successful in 
pursuing its interests in the global arena 
it is precisely where congress and the president have worked 
together as in afghanistan and cambodia or resolved differences 
as in angola the persian gulf and many aspects of ussoviet 
relations precisely there where our policies have succeeded and 
we see progress the president on friday told students and faculty 
at the university of virginia on the campus founded by thomas 
jefferson 
but where congress and the president have engaged each other as 
adversaries as over central america us policies have faltered 
and our common purposes have not been achieved reagan said 
reagan said he thought that congress in recent years had taken on 
too great a role in making foreign policy instead of linking his 
own support for the contra rebels to the difficulties in central 
america reagan blamed congress onagain offagain 
indecisiveness on resisting sandinista tyranny and aggression in 
nicaragua for leaving the area a region of continuing danger 
reagan complained about the war powers resolution which gives 
congress a veto power over the commitment of us troops abroad 
after a 60day period 
he lamented attempts by congress to manage complex issues of 
foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation such as 
unduly restrictive intelligence oversight limits on arms transfers 
and earmarking of 95 percent of our foreign assistance denying a 
president the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly changing 
conditions 
in his speech reagan also lauded soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev saying let us credit him for his reforms but reagan 
added that america must remain skeptical about the ussoviet 
relationship because serious problems fundamental differences 
remain 
yes we welcome mr gorbachevs recent announcement of a troop 
reduction reagan said but let us remember that the soviet 
preponderance in military power in europe remains an asymmetry 
that offends our jeffersonian senses and endangers our future 
so we must keep our heads and this means keeping our 
skepticism he said 
he credited gorbachev with taking some daring steps to bring 
about reforms that reagan said would have been unthinkable under 
former soviet leaders josef stalin nikita s khrushchev and leonid 
i brezhnev 
the president said the superpowers are coming closer to 
agreement on a strategic arms reduction talks treaty saying that 
where the portions of the draft treaty disputed by one side or the 
other are put in brackets we are slowly seeing the brackets 
disappear 
the president also credited americas strong and steadfast 
support of israels statehood for persuading the palestine 
liberation organization to moderate its views toward the jewish 
nation 
that resolve has now paid off with the opening of a usplo 
dialogue aimed at advancing peace in the middle east reagan said 
reagans speech came in the wake of his decision to reverse a 
13year us policy of refusing to have contact with the plo 
where we are strong and steadfast we succeed he said the 
country stood firm for years insisting that the plo had to accept 
israels right to exist and renounce terrorism 
during a brief questionandanswer session with students reagan 
called the opening to yasser arafats plo a great step forward 
but he said that peace will be achieved only when the principals 
come together to negotiate 
white house officials have said reagan plans a farewell address 
to the nation sometime in january probably from the oval office 
but spokesman roman popadiuk said friday that he did not know of any 
other foreign policy addresses scheduled in the remaining 35 days of 
reagans presidency

three of hollywoods holy relics have changed 
hands 
a piano played by sam in casablanca the hat worn by the 
wicked witch of the west in the wizard of oz and clark gables 
script for gone with the wind were all sold at auction friday 
the japanese trading company c itoh amp co outbid developer 
donald trump to buy the piano for 154000 on behalf of an 
anonymous casablanca fan in japan 
its because many japanese are fans of the old 40s movies 
said a company representative mashahiro kanaoka 
trump who was in the audience bidding went home without comment 
immediately after the piano sold at sothebys auction house in 
manhattan 
the green and beige upright piano used in the flashback sequence 
of the 194243 warner brothers classic had a presale estimate of 
75000 to 100000 by sothebys 
frankly a dear price was paid for gables script from the 1939 
film gone with the wind 77000 bid by telephone by detroit 
disc jockey dick purtan sothebys had listed an estimate of 3000 
to 4000 for the leathercovered script with gables name embossed 
in bold 
the auction catalog said gable gave the script to an mgm studios 
secretary who was a close personal friend 
an anonymous private collector in australia submitted the winning 
bid of 33000 for the witchs hat the black pointed hat was all 
that remained of the wicked witch when dorothy accidentally melted 
her with a bucket of water 
nine stemware glasses from ricks cafe americain in 
casablanca estimated at 1000 to 5000 sold for 3020 a 
masonite advertising board used at the movies 1943 premiere 
estimated at 5000 to 7000 was sold for 22000 
the casablanca piano was from the paris flashback scene at le 
belle aurore cafe where rick bogart and ilsa ingrid bergman 
discuss love marriage and the impending german occupation while sam 
dooley wilson plays as time goes by 
later rick and ilsa meet again at ricks cafe in casablanca 
where sam plays an encore on another piano 
you played it for her you can play it for me rick said to 
which sam replied but i dont think i can remember 
if she can stand it i can play it rick commanded in a 
line that has since been widely misquoted as play it again sam 
many famous props such as the ruby slippers from the wizard of 
oz and the sled from citizen kane were made in multiples 
however this piano from the paris scene is truly unique in that 
it was actually used throughout the entire paris cafe sequence 
the auction catalog said 
the piano also was used in 1943 in a us savings bond drive 
featuring judy garland mickey rooney and lucille ball

the 516 millionperplane pricetag for the b2 
stealth bomber makes it the most expensive aircraft ever built but 
air force secretary edward c aldridge says whatever the 
radarevading plane costs its worth it 
the stealth bomber which resembles a huge tailless manta ray 
is expected to make its first flight early next year but will not be 
ready for wartime use until 1992 at the earliest aldridge said 
friday 
aldridge told a news conference the design development and 
construction of 132 planes was expected to cost 681 billion by the 
time production ends in mid1995 
expressed in terms of the original estimate the price tag has 
grown from 366 billion to 425 billion in fiscal 1981 dollars 
an increase of about 16 percent aldridge said those figures do not 
reflect cost increases caused by inflation since 1981 or that 
projected in future years 
congress must authorize and appropriate money for production and 
the figures assume it will do so at the pace the air force proposes 
aldridge said a stretchout of production would boost the perplane 
cost by 20 percent or more 
the air force gave the public its first glimpse of the aircraft 
at a ceremony in palmdale calif last month 
about onethird of the total cost of the longrange bomber is 
being spent on research and development the actual production cost 
amounts to 305 million per plane aldridge said 
whatever it costs its worth it aldridge said how much 
is deterrence worth 
this thing is a significant contributor to the strategic 
deterrence of our country the soviets know it they know the 
capabilities this aircraft can provide 
aldridge reviewing the results of a longrunning internal review 
of the b2 said the air force had decided to slow production of the 
bomber during the early years of the program and to accelerate 
production at the end 
he refused to offer specific numbers but he said the 
acceleration at the end of the program would be such that production 
of all 132 of the planes would be completed a year early in 
mid1995 
the latest cost projection includes estimated savings of about 3 
billion the secretary continued thanks to the changes in 
production and a decision to purchase more than 100 of the planes 
under a single multiyear contract 
few of the planes will be built while the bomber is undergoing 
flight testing in the early years aldridge explained once the 
flight testing is completed and the design frozen a multiyear 
contract can be negotiated to achieve the most economical rate of 
production he added 
aldridge said a large portion of the cost increase about 1 
billion in fiscal 1981 dollars results from a major redesign 
effort in 1983 
the air force secretary said the redesign was ordered because the 
stealth bomber originally was meant only to fly at high altitude 
the air force decided in 1983 that the plane should be able to fly 
at low altitude as well and that forced a redesign of its flying 
wing shape he said 
the b2 gets its stealth name from the claim that it will be 
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar due to the extensive 
use of exotic composite materials its lack of sharp surface angles 
and a crosssection that offers a very small profile to radar it is 
built mainly by northrop corp 
at 516 million per copy the b2 would eclipse the new b1b 
bomber which cost about 280 million per copy as the most 
expensive plane in the air force inventory the newest model of the 
largest us commercial aircraft the boeing 747 sells for roughly 
125 million 
aldridge appearing before pentagon reporters on his last day in 
office before joining the mcdonnell douglas corp said the b2 
would fly for the first time as soon as its ready probably 
early next year 
he said the first operational b2 would be delivered to whiteman 
air force base mo in mid1991 and that the air force probably 
will select three additional bases to house them 
it probably will be at least 1992 before the plane is certified 
for initial operational capability meaning it could fly in a 
war aldridge said

the state department says us and soviet 
negotiators have reached virtual agreement on ways to measure some 
underground nuclear tests but a final agreement still eludes the 
two sides 
the result is further postponement of possible senate 
ratification of two nuclear test treaties completed more than a 
decade ago the treaties would limit underground blasts to 150 
kilotons 
president reagan has said he would submit the 1974 accord on 
weapons tests and the 1976 agreement on tests for civilian purposes 
only if agreement were reached on airtight procedures to guard 
against cheating 
reagan has accused the soviets of carrying out tests that 
probably exceeded the permissible ceiling some american experts 
doubted the soviets had violated the treaties which both sides are 
supposed to be observing even though the senate has not approved the 
pacts

defense minister yitzhak rabin accused radical 
palestinians of trying to undermine the usplo talks by staging 
violent riots in the occupied territories that left at least four 
arabs dead 
rabin and other officials refrained from direct comment friday 
after us and plo delegates held their first facetoface meeting 
in tunisia but they reiterated their opposition to washingtons 
decision to speak to the organization 
rabin said the us decision was a grave mistake 
you abandoned an important principle in the general american 
policy the principle of opposing terrorism and waging war against 
it he said on israel television 
rabin spoke after the 90minute meeting between us ambassador 
robert h pelletreau and a fourman plo delegation in carthage a 
suburb of the capital city tunis 
the defense minister said israel should demand the united states 
make arafat prove he was sincere when he said last week that he 
renounced all forms of terrorism 
our first demand from the united states should be put arafat 
to a test demand from him to come out and tell all the palestinians 
in his voice in arabic to stop terror rabin said 
despite his opposition to the americanplo dialogue rabin said 
it could lead to a decrease in violence 
it was clear to us that a large part of the palestinian 
population will see the events of the week as their achievement and 
will try to moderate their role in violence he said 
but it was also clear that radical elements who oppose these 
moves will try to heat up the area rabin told israel 
television 
rabin the no 2 man in the leftleaning labor party headed by 
foreign minister shimon peres echoed his party leader in saying 
israel should counter the us initiative with its own peace plan 
even if it would not be accepted in the foreseeable future 
he spoke on one of the bloodiest days of the palestinian 
rebellion against israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip 
in fridays clashes israeli soldiers shot to death four arabs 
and arab doctors said as many as 32 were woundedit was among the 
worst violence since april 16 when israeli troops killed 14 
palestinians during riots protesting the assassination in tunisia of 
khalil wazir the plo military commander 
the latest deaths brought to 328 the number of palestinians 
killed in the yearlong revolt thirteen israelis have also died 
during the unrest 
meanwhile aides to prime minister yitzhak shamir said the 
rightist likud bloc leader recognized the need for a credible 
israeli peace plan 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman said the prime minister was 
considering new moves 
be sure that mr shamir is preparing a peace move which will 
surprise everyone pazner said refusing to disclose details 
newspaper reports said the plan was to unilaterally establish a 
limited selfrule for palestinians as envisioned in the camp david 
accords mediated by the united states in 1978 
fridays confrontations in the occupied lands were inspired by 
the death thursday night of a teenager from a gunshot wound 
suffered nov 25 according to doctors at anglican hospital in 
nablus 
army officials said the riots appeared premeditated and began in 
numerous areas even before the teenagers funeral in the west bank 
city of nablus 
west bank commander brig gen gabi ofir said the high casualty 
toll resulted from the fact that we had to disperse riots in many 
locations 
doctors said 20 people were wounded in nablus four of them 
critically the army confirmed four killed and nine wounded 
soldiers wounded five palestinians in villages near tulkarem in 
the west bank including a 9yearold boy shot in the neck arab 
witnesses said 
doctors said seven young men were wounded at the rafah nuseirat 
and jabaliya refugee camps in the gaza strip

cardinal edmund szoka said a plan to close or 
merge 43 innercity roman catholic parishes is needed to erase a 
plantation mentality in which white pastors and lay people run 
churches attended mostly by blacks 
the plan which would entail the largest church closing in us 
roman catholic history has angered members of the citys 112 
catholic churches since it was announced in september 
the cardinal strongly defended the plan in a justreleased 
transcript of a dec 3 meeting of leaders of the archdiocese of 
detroit which covers southeastern michigan and has 15 million 
members under szokas leadership 
i know what i am doing and i believe that i am following gods 
will szoka said in the transcript they can lambaste me all 
they want but my purpose is to fulfill the gospel to make it 
possible for that gospel to be preached effectively to the people 
who are here now 
opponents of the closings who include both black and white 
parishioners picketed outside szokas home friday 
the number of catholics in detroit has decreased drastically as 
whites have fled the nations sixthlargest city for the suburbs in 
1976 more than 100000 catholic households were in detroit as 
against fewer than 50000 now 
about twothirds of the citys 11 million residents are black 
and the vast majority of churchaffiliated blacks are protestant 
szoka said the plan which targets parishes that are losing 
membership and are not considered economically viable will help 
deal with the complaints of black catholics that predominantly black 
parishes are led by whites 
black catholics tell me that they no longer want the plantation 
mentality the cardinal said they dont want this white pastor 
saying now you leave my black people alone ill take care of 
their needs 
we have the anomaly today of parishes which are predominantly 
black with a white pastor and a totally white staff why shouldnt 
these black people have the leadership in that parish why should we 
be importing people from the suburbs white people to come in here 
and continue to run these parishes 
surveys found that 95 percent of the citys churches had strong 
black membership but the operational structure was white auxiliary 
bishop patrick cooney said friday 
were not denying the value of what any white priest sisters 
or brothers have done in the city but sometime we have to stop and 
see whats best for the church and say hey its time for black 
catholic leaders to be seen and heard cooney said 
but the rev norman thomas pastor of sacred heart church in 
detroit and leader of the detroit catholic pastoral alliance a 
group fighting the plan said the assessment was distorted 
we run our own parish here said thomas a white pastor 
whose church staff members are mostly black residents of detroit 
i think szoka wants to do the right thing but hes being fed 
some very bad information and really is speaking with no experience 
on these things 
cooney who has spent five years overseeing the study of urban 
churches said he will deliver recommendations from appeal hearings 
on the closings to szoka on monday the cardinal is expected to make 
a final decision during the first week in january 
the archdiocese also released a letter of resignation friday from 
a member of the implementation committee one of two panels formed 
to help cooney judge the viability of urban churches 
sister mary kelly said in the letter that she believes the board 
will recommend closing churches that proved they were healthy in 
appeal hearings 
many parishes slated to close have in fact demonstrated 
viability in ways that could be models for other parishes she 
said 
under the plan 42 churches in detroit and one in nearby river 
rouge would close or merge with other parishes archdiocese 
officials held a series of hearings for parishes wishing to appeal 
the closings

a psychiatrist who illegally prescribed drugs 
to addicts has been sentenced to five years in prison by a judge who 
called him nothing but a highly educated wellplaced drug 
pusher 
dr edward m keelan also was fined 25000 on friday given a 
concurrent fiveyear prison sentence for two counts of witness 
tampering and ordered to serve five years probation after his 
release from prison 
the bottom line is hes just another drug pusher in a 
tailored suit said superior court judge leander gray 
in defense of his drugprescription practices keelan submitted a 
2page poem entitled maverick in the state in it he expressed 
an antitax philosophy and claimed the right to treat patients 
without state interference 
he also recited part of another poem in which he said voices 
including that of lucifer encouraged him to try to influence a 
witnesss testimony 
keelan 58 was arrested in december 1987 after an undercover 
agent from the state department of consumer protection received 
prescriptions for narcotics from the doctor at his milford office 
without any examination 
in october keelan entered a guilty plea to six counts of 
illegally prescribing narcotics and on friday he submitted guilty 
pleas to the witness tampering charges 
assistant states attorney francis j mcquade who prosecuted the 
case said the amount of damage he has done is mindboggling when 
compared to what a street dealer could even think of doing 
according to prosecutors keelan would see a stream of drug 
addicts and abusers at his office every saturday charging each 
visitor 20 to 30 apiece for writing a narcotics prescription the 
visits would typically last only about 10 minutes 
hes a plague on society he is a plague on the poor mcquade 
said 
undercover agents who watched his office said keelans visitors 
included every junkie we ever saw or heard of and a lot that we 
didnt mcquade said 
keelans attorney raymond w ganim told the judge the doctor 
deserved leniency because he is a manic depressive whose judgment 
was impaired by his failure to take proper dosages of his medication 
the man needs help he doesnt need incarceration ganim said 
but the judge said keelans mental illness could not be used as 
an excuse for his behavior in spite of his illness the judge 
noted keelan had held a number of posts in the medical field in 
recent years 
gray said keelan was nothing more than a highly educated 
wellplaced drug pusher who did it for the money 
psychiatrist robert miller testified at the sentencing hearing 
that keelans illness would not prevent him from knowing the 
difference between right and wrong 
keelans attorney said the doctors poem about being a maverick 
showed his judgment was impaired because if there is ever a time 
he should be on his knees this is it 
the prosecution cited the poem as evidence keelan puts himself 
above the law 
but the judge said he was not going to be swayed either way by 
the poem saying im not a poetry critic 
the state medical examining board ordered the revocation of 
keelans license last august

the cancellation of a navy bomber project 
has prompted the grumman corp to eliminate 3100 jobs but two 
congressmen whose region will be most affected promise to fight the 
government decision 
the company announced the layoffs friday in the wake of the 
navys decision to scrap the a6g bomber in the 1990 budget said 
grumman spokesman bob harwood 
this is quite a parting shot from the reagan administration an 
administration that says it is committed to a strong defense said 
rep george hochbrueckner dny 
rep thomas downey dny called the navys decision 
shortsighted 
both men vowed to fight to reverse the decision or to get 
additional work for grumman to avoid further cuts 
of the 3100 jobs 2500 are from the companys operations on new 
yorks long island the remaining 600 will be in florida georgia 
and maryland 
our whole industry is facing flat or declining budgets said 
grumman chairman john obrien 
a special edition of the company newspaper friday morning carried 
word of the layoffs which begin next month 
we know it is unfair to tell them at christmas but it would be 
unfair not to let them know what may be coming said harwood 
the a6g would have incorporated advanced digital electronics 
satellite navigation capability and a more powerful engine 
grumman has been building the a6 since the early 1960s 
upgrading it several times over the years the a6g an upgraded 
version of the bomber would have generated 1000 new engineering 
positions and brought in 250 million annually 
in the past two years grumman has been bumped from three major 
military aircraft contracts a contract to produce the navys 
advanced tactical aircraft the replacement for the a6 was awarded 
to mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics in 1987 and the company 
also lost out in the bidding for the air forces advanced tactical 
fighter 
grumman was at its peak in the late 1960s when it was building 
lunar modules and employed 40000 workers the company now employs 
32000 workers 
about 1800 of the long island layoffs will occur in january and 
the rest will come by the end of 1989 grumman had announced layoffs 
in january 1987 and last march

a traffic gridlock at picturesque carmel 
along highway 1 will be history if the california coastal commission 
gets its way 
the panel has given preliminary approval to a 25 million bypass 
through a prized forest of old pines and oaks 
other agencies that would have to approve the bypass include the 
us environmental protection agency the state department of fish 
and game the army corps of engineers and monterey county planners 
the 110 vote thursday has state highway engineers hoping they 
can ease a bottleneck on the states 1000mile coastal highway 1 
that results from traffic turning into carmels ocean avenue the 
traffic can stretch as far as five miles without moving 
carmel will never be the same after the first tree falls in 
hatton canyon warned sally mcphail a resident of the often 
touristchoked seaside town where actor clint eastwood served as 
mayor 
the town nestles close to the pacific 120 miles south of san 
francisco and just south of the pebble beach golf course it is 
populated by the wealthy and a colony of artists and writers 
called the hatton canyon freeway project the fourmile monterey 
peninsula bypass would run inland from highway 1 on the north edge 
of carmel through large virgin stands of monterey pines and native 
live oaks across the mouth of carmel valley to the east then back 
to highway 1 on the south edge of town 
during the threehour meeting commissioners heard nearly 40 
witnesses most of them opposed to the project 
in proxy statements monterey peninsula legislators approved the 
project and monterey county supervisor sam karras told the 
commission the bypass was crucially needed if we dont get on 
with the project there will be severe safety consequences 
one prominent exception to the nearly solid governmental support 
for the hatton canyon project was carmel mayor jean grace she said 
there were strong objections to a los angelesstyle interchange 
she said would be built at the north end of the bypass 
this roadway should lie gentle on the land she said echoing 
a sentiment expressed in a letter by her predecessor eastwood 
the issue of a highway 1 traffic relief dates back to the 1950s

the energy department should be able to 
meet conditions set by three governors for resolving a deadlock over 
the storage of radioactive waste from nuclear weapons plants a 
department official said 
the governors of idaho colorado and new mexico emerged from a 
private meeting friday with pledges of cooperation from deputy 
energy secretary joseph salgado 
i think weve laid a solid groundwork for progress weve put a 
process in place i believe it will bear fruit salgado said 
but the governors said they would continue to pressure the 
government to make sure the energy department honors its promise to 
hasten the opening of the waste isolation pilot plant a prototype 
storage facility under construction near carlsbad nm 
we stand here today to say there is no way we can guarantee 
anything there are uncertainties in the world but i think we can 
bridge that said colorado gov roy romer following the threehour 
meeting 
the officials announced progress toward resolving the most 
immediate problem triggered when idaho gov cecil andrus closed his 
states borders to waste shipments in october to try to force the 
energy department into action 
andrus said he would reconsider his decision if the energy 
department speeded up the new mexico plants opening his decision 
is expected next month 
andrus said he decided to reconsider after being told in a 
classified briefing that his ban on waste shipments into idaho could 
harm national security by forcing closure of the rocky flats nuclear 
weapons plant near denver 
since andrus order the material has been piling up at rocky 
flats which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads 
romer has said he would close the plant when its temporary 
storage capacity is filled that should occur between march and may 
after the meeting however romer said he doesnt anticipate 
closing the facility although i cannot work with additional 
storage in a metropolitan area of 15 million people 
waste is being stored temporarily at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory in eastern idaho until the new mexico plant 
opens which salgado said probably wont be until november or 
december 1989 
the plant originally scheduled to open last fall will store 
wastes including equipment and clothing that has been contaminated 
during the weaponsmaking process in salt deposits more than 2000 
feet underground 
andrus said that before he allows shipments to the idaho plant to 
resume the energy department must also keep its pledge to introduce 
legislation and begin administrative procedures for a land swap with 
the interior department that must be completed before the pilot 
plant can open 
the department also must prepare plans to remove the more than 4 
million cubic feet of radioactive waste already stored in idaho 
i said i wouldnt accept that old statement of trust me i 
said show me said andrus i said if youre sincere come 
back and prove it to me in january and well reconsider 
salgado said the department would appoint a task force to look 
for other temporary waste storage sites in case andrus refuses to 
lift his ban 
but he expressed confidence that the necessary conditions could 
be met to continue operations at rocky flats and move forward with 
the opening of the pilot plant 
one of the biggest stumbling blocks has been congress failure to 
pass a bill to transfer several thousand acres of land around the 
new mexico plant from interior department control to the energy 
department 
the opening also has been delayed because of lapses in 
engineering assessments and questions about water leakage at the 
site 
salgado said the department will have a bill introduced when 
congress convenes in january the department also will start 
administrative procedures for the exchange should congress move too 
slowly he said 
clearly i think the doe is trying to turn up the heat new 
mexico gov garrey carruthers said at a news conference in santa fe 
nm upon his return from utah

rescuers found 21 people alive in spitak 
and leninakan more than a week after they were buried in an 
earthquake and officials said the discovery persuaded them to 
extend the search for survivors 
an armenian official told a politburo commission overseeing 
rescue operations that of the 135 people pulled from ruins 21 were 
saved his report was shown on soviet television friday night 
in leninakan 110 were pulled out and 20 were alive in spitak 
only one was alive said the official who was not identified he 
said the survivors were found thursday 
the discovery of one person still alive in spitak spurred 
searchers there to continue looking for another 10 days said the 
official it was not clear how large an area would be included in 
the continued search 
on thursday a communist party official from the city said crews 
would begin sunday to raze what remained of the city an estimated 
15000 of spitaks 25000 residents died in the dec 7 quake 
spitak and leninakan were two of the cities hit hardest in the 
quake which killed an estimated 55000 people and left 500000 
homeless in the armenian republic 
tanks and armored personnel carriers sealed off spitak on friday 
at least 10 bulldozers were clearing away rubble and trucks filled 
with debris were leaving the city 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov told a politburo committee meeting 
that some work was going slowly because relatives were lying in 
front of bulldozers to prevent them from moving in until their 
relatives bodies were recovered 
george reid a spokesman for the league of red cross and red 
crescent societies told reporters in yerevan that 22312 dead had 
been recovered by friday 537 more than thursday 
he said the red cross was bringing in 5000 insulated winter 
tents and that soviet officials were hoping to bring in 5000 mobile 
homes to shelter men in spitak who will work on reconstructing the 
city 
the head of the soviet red cross also said friday that soviet 
doctors can handle the medical treatment of armenian earthquake 
victims and do not need further international help 
we can accept individuals from abroad to show them what has 
been done but we dont need medical assistance in the direct 
sense said dmitri venidiktov chairman of the soviet red cross 
and former deputy health minister he told a news conference in 
yerevan that medical teams had come from throughout the soviet union 
since the earthquake 
several foreign doctors have complained privately that their 
soviet colleagues were not allowing them to treat patients with the 
millions of dollars worth of sophisticated medical equipment brought 
to the soviet union to handle the disaster 
ryzhkov praised the work of the foreign teams and criticized the 
foreign ministry for providing inadequate assistance to the rescue 
groups from abroad 
in moscow an armenian government representative eduard 
aikazyan said each survivor would receive 500 rubles or 833 and 
that families would get 2000 rubles or 3333 in addition to the 
amount allotted individuals 
the soviet government frequently makes cash payments from the 
central budget to victims of accidents and disaster 
help continued to be offered from abroad 
in budapest the official hungarian news agency mti said the 
hungarianarmenian friendship circle plans to take in children 
orphaned in the earthquake 
the brief report gave no indication of how many children would be 
affected or when or how they would be taken to hungary 
the japanese foreign ministry said today japan will send a team 
of experts to armenia to assist in reconstruction efforts following 
a request from soviet authorities 
the focus of the rescue has shifted from lifesaving efforts to 
reconstruction the ministry said in a statement we hope the 
teams research and analysis based on our countrys expertise on 
earthquake studies and seismology can contribute to the 
reconstruction of the area

the glow from an oil lamp illuminated 
the faces of the armenian villagers who came in from the snow to 
visit the mayor in the plastic hut he and his family have lived in 
since the dec 7 earthquake 
the mayor napoleon megerditchyan who was pinned under a block 
of stone for several hours until his son rescued him reassured the 
men of the village that their mountainside homes would be rebuilt 
within two years 
gorbachev said he will do something and he will 
megerditchyan said referring to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who toured the disaster area last week 
in the meantime authorities are faced with finding winter 
shelter for the estimated 500000 survivors of one of the centurys 
worst quakes 
the oneroom corrugated shack thrown up immediately after the 
earthquake with supplies from the red cross is cool already and 
will offer scant protection when temperatures drop further this 
winter 
throughout the region armenians are preparing to endure the 
approaching soviet winter and recover from the shock of an 
earthquake that killed at least 55000 people 
in lusakhpyur about 600 of the 1000 residents already have left 
seeking warmth in the homes of friends and relatives who survived 
the quake seventy villagers were killed including 50 children 
crushed in a grade school corridor as they ran from collapsing 
classrooms 
icecovered mountain roads connecting northwestern armenian 
villages were bumper to bumper thursday with cars buses and trucks 
listing under the weight of refugees and their few belongings 
soviet military trucks with supplies of bread milk meat heavy 
coats and boots struggled through the traffic to deliver supplies to 
the needy people generally did not appear hungry or in need of warm 
clothes although some complained the emergency rations werent 
being distributed fairly 
they select those they want to give to and there is a 
hierarchy said asat petzosyan of spitak a city of about 25000 
almost wiped out by the quake officials say about 15000 died in 
spitak 
i need somewhere to sleep petzosyan said rubbing hands 
scarred from digging through the rubble searching for family and 
friends all i have been given is this coat 
petzosyan and his neighbors have gathered pieces of broken 
furniture and torn mattresses to create living rooms without walls 
around outdoor bonfires their only protection against the icy wind 
down the street an elderly man stood motionless surrounded by 
the roar of bulldozers staring into a heap of rubble twostories 
high tears ran down his unshaven cheeks 
my granddaughter is in there he said faintly she is four 
im waiting for her 
but a happy ending is unlikely soviet authorities fearing the 
spread of disease from decaying bodies began razing spitak on 
friday 
later workers rescued 21 people from the ruins in spitak and 
leninakan prompting authorities to extend their search for possible 
survivors 
george reid a spokesman for the league of red cross and red 
crescent societies said the greatest challenge now is providing 
shelter for those who remain it is a terrible dilemma of 
conflicting needs the need for sanitation and the feelings of 
relatives he said 
officials say they will evacuate 70000 people but that leaves 
430000 without homes reid said where do you put 430000 
people for the winter 
the red cross is bringing in 5000 winter tents like those 
already delivered by the norwegian army 
and soviet authorities are hoping to bring in by rail thousands 
of yurts versions of the circular tents used for centuries on the 
frigid steppes of central asia soviet soldiers are working beside 
civilian crews to quickly repair the rail lines just outside spitak 
soviet officials also hope to bring in thousands of mobile homes 
for the local men who will be rebuilding their town 
azen akopyan a worker at an elevator factory will stay in the 
mobile home camp near spitak his wife nina will join her children 
next week at a temporary shelter set up by his trade union to house 
survivors 
i dont want to leave until azen is in a warm place but i wish 
they would hurry said mrs akopyan one of the few women in town 
who did not lose a member of her immediate family when they 
rebuild spitak i guess ill be back but really after all this i 
am so afraid of the mountains

outside monterrey said authorities reported a small plane was seen 
early friday and appeared in trouble possibly low on fuel 
then they lost contact ms suarez said by telephone it 
appears to be a foreign plane 
ms suarez said authorities immediately dispatched police units 
and a helicopter to search the area 
the copilot was susan reynolds 25 of dallas according to the 
crafts owner roger crownrich the name of the pilot was not 
immediately known 
crownrich who owns crownrich construction management inc in 
dallas said the jet was used for his business most of the time but 
was on a charter run at the time of the crash 
ms reynolds and a pilot routinely flew to memphis to pick up 
federal express packages for delivery he said but crownrich said 
the regular pilot was not aboard the latest flight 
it came as a bolt of lighting to me said crownrich i flew 
the plane yesterday to detroit and it was just purring like a 
kitten at up to 45000 feet which is its normal flying altitude 
he said something could have happened to the planes occupants or 
the craft could have been sabotaged 
it is pretty obvious that the plane was performing well and was 
bound to be on auto pilot and it flew that course on until fuel 
starvation he said but why the pilot and copilot were not 
able to talk to the flight service is beyond me

an alleged divorcefixing scheme involving former 
miss america bess myerson struck at the firmest pillar of good 
government a prosecutor said as four days of closing arguments 
ended 
after hearing defense and prosecution lawyers finish their 
summations on friday us district judge john f keenan said he 
would turn the case over to the jury after instructing them on the 
law the panel should get the case monday afternoon 
miss myerson miss america in 1945 and once new york citys 
cultural affairs commissioner is accused of trying to influence a 
judges rulings in the divorce of her lover carl andy capasso 
according to prosecutors former state supreme court justice 
hortense gabel slashed capassos weekly support payments to his 
estranged wife weeks after miss myerson gave a 19000ayear city 
job to the judges daughter sukhreet gabel in august 1983 
miss myerson 64 capasso 43 and mrs gabel who turned 76 
friday are all charged with plotting to fix the divorce and then 
cover up the scheme 
in addition miss myerson is charged with obstruction of justice 
she faces a maximum 30 years in prison and 513000 in fines if 
convicted on all counts her codefendants face up to 25 years and 
263000 if convicted 
assistant us attorney stuart abrams noted that carved on the 
facade of the court building where the capasso divorce proceedings 
were conducted are the words the true administration of justice 
is the firmest pillar of good government 
the scheme in this case ladies and gentlemen struck at that 
pillar 
previously myerson attorney frederick hafetz derided the 
prosecution case as a soap opera not a criminal trial 
but abrams maintained this is not a soap opera its a crime 
most of the government case was based on circumstantial evidence 
because neither an eyewitness to the alleged bribe plot nor tape 
recording of it existed 
the main prosecution witness sukhreet gabel testified that 
after a grand jury began an investigation in 1986 miss myerson 
urged her to keep your mouth shut because you could be 
dangerous 
but on crossexamination ms gabel admitted her trial testimony 
differed from what she had told investigators and the grand jury on 
several occasions 
hafetz who got ms gabel to admit that electroshock treatments 
for depression had left her memory like swiss cheese told the 
jury that shes a walking definition of reasonable doubt 
to convict on any of the charges jurors must find the government 
proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt

government officials said four japanese whaling 
ships left today for the antarctic where they plan to catch 300 
whales in a controversial research program 
the departure of the fleet was delayed more than a week while 
japan tried to lessen us opposition to the research plan 
we wanted to show the united states that japan is proceeding 
seriously within the provisions of the charter of the international 
whaling commission one official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
last spring the us government banned japanese fishing boats 
from us waters because of the whaling research which it charged 
was diminishing the effectiveness of a moratorium on commercial 
whaling imposed in 1986 by the 42member whaling commission 
basic differences remain between the two sides another 
official said also speaking on condition he not be named we 
believe that we have done everything possible to try to get the 
united states to understand our position 
the efforts included visits by japanese officials to the united 
states and contacts by embassy officials in washington he said 
japan the worlds biggest consumer of whale meat officially 
ended its commercial whaling in the antarctic at the end of the 
198687 season after it caught 1941 whales 
last season it announced it would kill 875 whales for research 
purposes but reduced that to 300 after international environmental 
groups charged the research program was commercial whaling in 
disguise 
officials say japanese whalers last year actually caught 273 
whales all minkes a variety not in immediate danger of extinction 
from our perspective some groups in the united states have 
been taking the whaling issue to an extreme turning it into a moral 
question rather than a scientific question the second official 
said japanese people dont see why you shouldnt kill even one 
minke whale if more than 700000 currently exist and dont believe 
that eating whales makes you a barbarian 
the whaling commission passed the commercial whaling moratorium 
to give scientists a chance to evaluate whale stocks the moratorium 
is to be evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research findings 
under the commissions charter each member country is able to 
conduct whaling research whenever it wishes however environmental 
groups have charged japan is using that clause as a way to get 
around the whaling ban and maintain its whaling industry 
japanese officials in turn charge other commission members have 
not been seriously conducting research during the moratorium period 
and plan merely to renew the ban in 1990 only a minority of 
commission members are whaling nations 
japanese officials say a representative sampling of whales must 
be killed to accurately study their age sex diet and health 
antiwhaling groups say other research methods are available that 
dont involve killing 
japan hopes the research will prove there are sufficient numbers 
of some whale species such as the minke to allow resumption of 
limited commercial whaling in 1990

a navy f14 fighter jet 
struck another jet while attempting to land and crashed into nearby 
waters but both crewmen aboard escaped uninjured authorities said 
the fighter crashed shortly before 7 pm friday on approach to a 
runway at the air station which occupies the northern end of an 
island 5 miles east of san francisco said coast guard lt michael 
sullivan 
the whole plane was shattered into pieces of debris said 
coast guard coxswain louis hubbard who was in charge of one of the 
rescue boats 
the pilot and radar officer who ejected from the aircraft were 
pulled from the alameda estuary one by a passing tugboat the other 
was found about 150 yards from shore by the coast guard rescue boat 
the crewmen who were not identified were taken to a naval 
hospital by ambulance sullivan said he added both were in very 
good condition and were being observed for possible effects of 
shock 
the aircraft was one of three f14s in alameda from miramar naval 
air station near san diego the others had landed and the third was 
about to touch down when it clipped a wing of one of the f14s 
already on the runway said navy spokesman bill valente 
the plane then veered off and crashed sinking in about 12 feet 
of water valente said 
in 1972 the 30 million f14 tomcat became the standard fleet 
flighter aboard aircraft carriers it was popularized in the movie 
top gun starring tom cruise 
the planes wings can extend to 64 feet for takeoff and landing 
and can be swept back to 33 feet to reduce air drag at high speeds

accused american hightech 
smuggler charles mcvey lost another round in his complex legal 
battle to avoid extradition to the united states 
mcvey failed friday to win an appeal after three days of 
arguments before the british columbia supreme court 
the us government is attempting to extradite mcvey 63 to face 
charges of selling classified hightechnology computer equipment to 
the soviet union 
however there have been a series of legal battles and appeals in 
the case that started when mcvey was arrested in august 1987 while 
on a fishing trip to the yukon 
mcvey being held in vancouver was indicted in 1983 by the us 
government on conspiracyrelated charges in connection with the 
shipment of computer equipment to the soviet union from four 
computer shops he owned in anaheim calif 
mcvey has denied he was part of a scheme to defraud the 
californiabased saxpy computer corp of proprietary rights to its 
super computer 
the legal action friday related to an aug 5 order by justice 
alan macdonell that mcvey be extradited macdonell had ruled he 
believed there was sufficient evidence to try mckey on charges of 
defrauding the defunct computer company 
mcveys lawyer robert anderson argued this week for a habeas 
corpus application that was in effect an appeal of the macdonell 
decision 
anderson said friday he intends now to appeal the case before the 
british columbia court of appeal

southern bell has reversed a decision to limit 
installations and repairs at four crimeriddled public housing 
projects one of which is so violent that letter carriers get police 
escorts 
the phone company had scaled back service in bankhead courts and 
the englewood gilbert gardens and jonesboro south apartments after 
a female technician was harassed at gilbert gardens by six men who 
accused her of being a police officer one man drew a gun while the 
others rifled her van 
the woman was released when the resident whose phone she had 
repaired came outside and vouched for her phone company spokesman 
doug kendig said 
the company had restricted service calls to monday mornings 
except for emergencies and only allowed workers to enter the 
projects in groups 
southern bell officials announced friday that they were changing 
that policy and said they had scheduled a meeting monday with police 
chief morris redding to discuss security precautions 
the bankhead courts housing project has a reputation for danger 
crime statistics on the project itself were unavailable but the 
zone 1 police precinct which covers the 25 square miles 
encompassing the project reported 41 homicides 122 rapes and 609 
robberies in 1987 said police spokeswoman myrna may in october 
1988 the zone reported six homicides 16 rapes and 145 robberies 
she said 
mayor andrew young had condemned the phone service cutback and 
atlanta housing authority spokeswoman cynthia hoke said that the 
authority was outraged by it 
postal officials suspended service in the project for one day 
after shots were fired near a letter carrier dec 10 city officials 
criticized the move and service to the 500unit complex resumed 
wednesday under police escort 
kendig said the initial decision to restrict service calls 
resulted because weve had folks flash guns and pull knives on our 
installers and threaten to use explosives on our vans 
the service restrictions were the latest events in the bankhead 
courts crime drama which police officials say has been violent and 
drugridden for most of its 19 years 
four police officers were injured there while making arrests in a 
nov 5 drug sweep that led to the arrest of 12 residents a nov 10 
raid by 37 officers led to 27 arrests nine on drug charges and 
18 for traffic violations and other charges 
a 24yearold woman who journeyed into the complex with friends 
was killed nov 3 when a drug dealer fearing undercover police 
officers opened fire on her car as it approached with its 
headlights off

wall street is a house divided as christmas 
approaches with merger specialists raking in big yearend bonuses 
while brokers fear layoffs because of the slump in stock trading 
somebody could easily say its like charles dickens its the 
best of times its the worst of times said pj johnson a 
spokesman for nomura securities international inc 
the surge of takeover business this year has enriched investment 
bankers the kingpin of leveraged buyouts henry kravis of kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co is likely to earn 40 million to 50 million 
or more this year estimated perrin long an analyst for lipper 
analytical services inc 
meanwhile wall streeters whose livelihoods depend on the volume 
of stock trading are suffering because transactions by individuals 
and institutions have tailed off since the crash of oct 19 1987 
smith barney harris upham amp co announced this week it had laid 
off about 120 employees largely in its municipal bond and stock 
departments that was a fraction of the 1800 that grumman corp 
announced it will lay off come january but it nonetheless sent 
tremors through wall street 
dean witter reynolds inc a unit of sears roebuck amp co that 
depends heavily on retail brokerage business saw its profits 
slashed in half through the first nine months of the year it has 
had no major layoffs and none are in the works but many brokers who 
work on straight commissions have left 
the mood is probably as bad as ive seen it since 1972 or 1973 
when the bear market was really bad said bard quku a senior vice 
president for sales at dean witter in new york 
quku said his own business has held up well but he said 
theres some people who are losing hope 
the mood has not been a real jovial one the last month or 
two said gary goldstein president of the whitney group an 
executive recruiting firm that specializes in toppaying wall street 
jobs 
spirits have picked up recently as it became apparent that 
bonuses overall would not be slashed from their 1987 levels 
goldstein said bonuses may fall 20 percent to 50 percent for stock 
traders and municipal finance specialists but rise for investment 
bankers he estimated 
income producers like sales people and investment bankers get 
money from a bonus pool based mainly on performance backoffice 
employees from mailroom clerks to the personnel director are 
getting bonuses equalling about 20 weeks of their salaries 
the decline in living standards is of course all relative 
even in this operating environment anyone who wants to work 
hard and has a little bit of luck he or she can probably make more 
on wall street than just about anyplace else long said 
retrenchment in many cases means selling a second house or 
forgoing an expensive vacation i spoke to someone yesterday who 
had a horse farm in princeton whos selling the horses selling the 
farm goldstein said 
shearson lehman hutton inc canceled money for christmas parties 
this year as it did in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market 
crash but employees in retail trading put up 100 apiece so they 
could have their own party friday night 
we only took the hundred bucks from the people we thought could 
afford it the ones making six figures said peter dapuzzo the 
senior executive vice president for retail trading 
everybody has confidence at shearson that this too will pass 
and things will get better dapuzzo said 
the downturn on wall street has provoked some to go into 
businesses they once disdained goldstein said he knew of a harvard 
business school graduate who probably made 1 million a year at his 
peak who left investment banking to go into the family clothing 
retailing business 
david resler chief economist of nomura securities writes a 
yuletide review of the year each christmas and this year the theme 
was the slump on wall street it said in part 
the year eightyeight found the markets less frisky 
as investors judged trading as overly risky 
so many decided on the sidelines theyd stay 
and the rest took great care when the markets theyd play

the widow of prime minister olof palme 
has agreed to try to identify a 41yearold swede being held in the 
investigation of her husbands assassination a newspaper reported 
today 
christer pettersson who was arrested wednesday pleaded innocent 
friday in a preliminary hearing but a judge ruled there were 
reasonable grounds to suspect he killed palme and ordered him held 
for further investigation 
palme the dominant figure in swedish politics for more than a 
decade was killed feb 28 1986 while walking home unguarded from a 
downtown movie theater with his wife lisbet mrs palme was grazed 
by a bullet in the shooting which took place at close range 
the expressen newspaper said mrs palme was willing to try to 
identify the suspect but that it remained unclear whether she would 
be summoned to do so 
we would like to spare her as long as possible the newspaper 
quoted a source close to the investigation as saying if we can do 
without her testimony we will try to do that 
in another development prosecutor jorgen almblad complained 
about the publication of petterssons picture in foreign newspapers 
saying that would complicate the case 
if a witness says he has seen the photograph of a suspect in 
the paper the value of the evidence will be rather low at a 
confrontation almblad said on swedish radio 
several witnesses have identified pettersson as the man seen 
standing outside the movie theater before the palmes emerged press 
reports said saturday but no evidence has emerged that he was the 
gunman 
the killer followed the couple down the street for several blocks 
before the shooting then escaped down a dark alley 
swedens press and libel regulations prohibit publication in this 
country of the names and pictures of suspects in criminal cases in 
some instances even after a person has been convicted 
however personal information about swedes is easily available 
from various national offices since his arrest pettersons name 
has been a matter of public record and anyone can obtain a picture 
of him for a 50cent fee at the central passport office 
public records show pettersson has a history of psychiatric 
treatment drug and alcohol abuse and a long criminal record 
including a conviction for manslaughter norwegian danish and 
english papers published the name and photograph of pettersson and 
foreign papers available in stockholm were sold out at some news 
stands 
many papers hailed the arrest and fridays arraignment as a major 
breakthrough in a case that has been a national frustration for 
nearly three years government commissions accused police of 
bungling in the crucial first days of the manhunt 
the chief investigator has been replaced twice and a private 
investigation led to the resignation of justice minister annagreta 
leijon in june but prosecutors have put forward no motive and the 
murder weapon was not found 
after nearly three years of uncertainty the palme murder is 
now on the way to a solution anchor man jarl alfredius said on 
fridays nightly news

after 20 years in congress and more than 
a month spent challenging his 791vote loss to a republican newcomer 
in the nov 8 general election democratic us rep william 
chappell has formally conceded 
craig james whose campaign emphasized reports linking chappell 
to investigations of the pentagon procurement scandal defeated the 
10term incumbent by less than 1 percent of about 250000 votes cast 
in the northeast florida district 
i must acknowledge the republican party has won the seat in the 
4th congressional district of florida and i have decided against 
pursuing a challenge any further chappell said friday 
chappell 66 sought to have the florida supreme court throw out 
nearly 11000 votes from flagler county because they arrived at the 
state division of elections office one day after a sevenday state 
deadline that would have given him a 229vote victory but the 
court turned back his request nov 30

yasser arafat said today the palestine 
liberation organizations main priority in talks with the united 
states is to push for an international peace conference on the 
middle east 
speaking with reporters after his arrival in tunis a day after 
the historic opening of an official usplo dialogue arafat also 
said he would do his best to prevent his followers from carrying out 
any terrorist attacks 
the plo chairman described as a step in the right direction 
fridays meeting between us ambassador robert pelletreau jr and a 
fourman plo delegation arafat said the plos prime objective in 
the talks is to push forward for the international conference to 
be held very soon 
israel has rejected proposals for an international conference on 
the middle east which would include the five permanent members of 
the un security council britain france china the united 
states and the soviet union and the parties to the conflict 
asked if he could assure that no palestinian terrorist attacks 
would be staged arafat said it is difficult to control all 
individuals or groups but he added we will do all our best to 
stop all this 
arafat also suggested without providing any details that he 
played a role in the freeing friday in lebanon of peter winkler a 
swiss official of the international committee of the red cross who 
had been kidnapped a month earlier no group claimed responsibility 
for his abduction 
when i was in geneva the chief of the red cross asked me to 
help release the swiss employee and he has been released arafat 
said without elaborating 
he condemned israeli soldiers for killing at least four 
palestinians during clashes in the occupied lands on friday 
arafat called it continuing state terrorism he said it is 
a message from the israeli military junta and the israeli leaders 
who are still refusing to accept peace a just peaceful 
settlement 
arafat said the plo and the united states had agreed to meet 
again but he did not say when the chief plo spokesman ahmed 
abdulrahman said the next talks would take place after 
presidentelect george bush takes office jan 20 
fridays meeting between delegations led by pelletreau and yasser 
abdrabbou a member of the plo executive committee came two days 
after washington reversed a longstanding policy of refusing to deal 
with the plo 
washington said it did so because the plo met conditions set for 
the talks including recognizing isreals right to exist and 
renouncing terrorism 
the historic session inspired hope in many quarters that advances 
can be made in the middle east peace process which had stagnated 
recently 
we hope the application of this change in the policy of the 
united states will be practiced through a real pressure on israel in 
order to change the policy of occupation the policy of terrorism 
the policy of oppression against our palestinian people 
abdrabbou said after the 90minute session friday 
our discussions were very practical and characterized i would 
say by seriousness of purpose pelletreau said after his 
90minute session with a fourman plo delegation the us 
ambassador implied there would be other meetings but did not say 
when 
it is our hope that this dialogue as it develops will help 
bring about direct negotiations that will lead to comprehensive 
peace said pelletreau who was accompanied to the talks by edmund 
hull political counselor at the us embassy in tunis 
the meeting took place at dar maghrebia an official tunisian 
government guest residence in carthage a suburb just north of 
tunis neither side gave substantive details of the talks

the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia 
today rescued three irish soldiers serving with the un 
peacekeeping force who had been kidnapped a day earlier by 
proiranian guerrillas in south lebanon 
lebanons most influential shiite moslem cleric was quoted as 
saying he had suspended efforts to win the release of 14 
foreigners held hostage his comment was published today one day 
after a swiss hostage was freed 
i have suspended my initiative on behalf of the hostages 
because it reached a dead end the beirut daily newspaper alliwaa 
quoted sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah as saying fadlallah is the 
spiritual guide of hezbollah the umbrella group for proiranian 
factions holding most hostages 
red cross worker peter winkler 32 was freed friday night in 
hisbeh square in the southern city of sidon the same spot where he 
was abducted nov 17 the swiss foreign ministry said winkler would 
probably fly home sunday via cyprus 
the abduction of the irish soldiers occurred friday in tibnin a 
village bordering israels selfproclaimed security zone the 
abductions were apparently intended to retaliate for israels 
seizure thursday of guerrilla commander jawad kasfi in tibnin 
police sources said the kidnappers demanded the un interim 
force in lebanon with which the irish soldiers served negotiate 
with israel for the release of kasfi and three other guerrillas 
seized thursday by israel 
the israeli military command said kasfi was suspected of 
organizing and participating in kidnappings and dozens of attacks 
against israeli army forces and the allied south lebanon army 
militia since 1984 
todays rescue was daring resulting in the capture of 22 shiite 
zealots who helped abduct the irish soldiers a police spokesman 
said 
the spokesman said the three were rescued from a house in 
sultaniyeh a village one mile outside tibnin headquarters of the 
620strong irish battalion serving with the un peacekeeping force 
the rescue operation according to the spokesman was completed 
at dawn when 15 guerrillas of the faithful resistance surrendered 
to amal and set free the three irish soldiers 
the faithful resistance is a small group of shiite 
fundamentalists affiliated with the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god 
the fighters surrendered after amal militiamen in a smart and 
quiet move arrested the faithful resistances seven commanders in 
the whole region the spokesman said the fighters surrendered 
because they didnt know what to do after amal arrested their 
commanders they surrendered peacefully 
winkler who spoke to journalists as he was driven out of sidon 
on his way to beirut said of his captivity ive never known that 
four weeks can be as long as that 
asked if he would resume red cross work in lebanon winkler said 
im afraid i will have to leave lebanon soon my enthusiasm 
has suffered 
winkler looked fit with no sign of maltreatment 
in bern swiss foreign minister rene felber said today that 
winklers captors tried to tie his release to a lenient sentence for 
a jailed lebanese plane hijacker hussein hariri but switzerland 
refused any concessions 
felber said that in indirect contacts the kidnappers identified 
themselves as members of a dissident palestinian group named 
organization of socialist revolution 
swedens ambassador in damascus rolf gauffin acted as 
intermediary after the hijackers contacted him tuesday felber told 
a press conference he said recent talks between a swiss official 
and palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat also were 
useful he did not elaborate 
at a news conference in tunisia today arafat suggested without 
providing any details that he played a role in the freeing winkler 
edouard brunner the swiss foreign ministrys no 2 man met 
arafat wednesday when the plo chief was in geneva for a un general 
assembly session 
brunner told reporters today that arafat asked for a drawing of 
the place where winkler was kidnapped to determine whether it was in 
palestiniancontrolled territory 
the recent political successes of the plo may also have 
contributed to winklers early release brunner said 
the christiancontrolled voice of lebanon radio station said 
winkler was released by the fatahrevolutionary council the 
guerrilla group headed by palestinian terrorist abu nidal 
a police spokesman quoted winkler as saying he did not know the 
identity of those who held him but that the captors told him that 
i was being held to guarantee that hussein hariri will be treated 
well in switzerland 
hariri a shiite moslem lebanese goes on trial in lausanne on 
feb 20 on charges of hijacking an air afrique jetliner on july 14 
1987 and forcing it to land at geneva airport he is accused of 
killing a french passenger 
winklers release leaves 14 foreigners including nine americans 
held hostage in lebanon the hostage held longest is terry anderson

a woman getting out of a taxicab fell through a 
sidewalk subway grating 50 feet onto the tracks below where she was 
partially wedged beneath an electrified third rail officials said 
however the 28yearold woman apparently didnt touch the 
600volt third rail officials said she was hospitalized today in 
critical condition with a broken pelvis and numerous cuts 
the grating in brooklyn may have been weakened because cars were 
driven over it during road repairs said jared lebow a transit 
authority spokesman 
transit officials said they didnt know whether angela williams 
stepped onto the grating and it fell under her weight or whether it 
had fallen into the air vent before the accident thursday night the 
metal grating was found 11 feet down the shaft 
power was shut off within five minutes of the accident and 
service was disrupted on two lines for 25 minutes lebow said 
the sixlane parkway which has singlelane access roads on both 
sides is under reconstruction people living in buildings on the 
access roads often drive across a median because their lanes are 
blocked lebow said

rajiv gandhi comes to china monday for the first 
visit by an indian prime minister since his grandfather jawalharlal 
nehru made the trip 34 years ago 
for gandhis nation and his political future the stakes appear 
high for china little seemingly can go wrong 
during a week long on symbolism but short on substance gandhi 
will be feted in the capital tour the ancient city of xian and 
visit shanghai 
the visit gandhi recently said will be very important for 
this globe for asia and for both of us 
the two nations the worlds most populous will probably sign 
agreements on civil aviation border trade and science and 
technology indian and western diplomats said speaking on condition 
of anonymity china and india also may agree to establish consular 
offices 
but no substantial progress is expected on the critical issue of 
their 2400mile border over which the two countries fought a brief 
war in 1962 
the two countries began border talks in 1981 but have made little 
progress china claims 36000 square miles of indian territory 
india rejects the claim and demands that china return the 15200 
square miles it took in the 1962 war 
since then relations have improved but only slightly the 
border remains heavily guarded on both sides and bilateral trade 
which resumed in 1977 but amounted to only 150 million last year 
is limited 
both china and india say gandhis visit is intended to create an 
atmosphere for greater communication and not to resolve the border 
question but western diplomats said pressures on gandhi could make 
him more willing to compromise than his chinese counterparts 
china is moving quickly to improve relations with the soviet 
union after nearly three decades of hostility a summit between 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and chinese leader deng 
xiaoping may be held next year 
better chinesesoviet relations will eliminate moscows need to 
cultivate new dehli as a foil against beijing and by removing 
tensions along its northern border china will be under less 
pressure to accomodate india on its southern flank 
china continues its close relationship with pakistan indias 
traditional enemy pakistans new prime minister benazir bhutto is 
expected to visit china in january on her first official trip abroad 
for gandhi the whole visit has an air of him running along so 
he doesnt get left out in the cold said a western diplomat in 
beijing who recently returned from new delhi for the chinese the 
visit cant possibly go wrong 
a society that speaks with one voice when it comes to foreign 
affairs china has watched with apparent enjoyment as the indian 
press has pressured gandhi to make progress on the border issue 
western diplomats said 
the prime minister has decided to stick yet another label to 
his travel bags wrote the normally progovernment times of india 
in an editorial wednesday the more important question however 
is what is the prime minister going to china for 
gandhi also faces an election next year in which victory is far 
from certain diplomats say he must convince his public that simply 
establishing goodwill with the chinese and not achieving a 
dramatic breakthrough is a worthy goal 
if he feels that he is failing at that he might be persuaded 
to do something rash the western diplomat said 
india could use the dalai lama the exiled tibetan leader who has 
taken refuge in india since 1959 to embarrass the chinese the 
tibetan refugees parliamentinexile on friday called on gandhi to 
raise the issue of tibet with chinese leaders 
but indias hand is weakened by chinas apparent willingness to 
crush dissent in tibet regardless of international opinion on dec 
10 police shot and killed at least one monk in lhasa the capital 
of tibet during an antichinese demonstration in addition new 
delhi also has backed chinas claims to the region 
india was one of the first nonsocialist countries to recognize 
china in the early 1950s relations soured in the early 1960s over 
the border question and political disagreements 
relations improved slightly in the late 1970s china invited an 
indian leader to visit as early as 1979 but india agreed to come 
only in november of last year 
western diplomats say the timing of the acceptance was 
significant because it came well after sinosoviet relations had 
begun to improve

more than 48 million people cast ballots for 
george bush for president six weeks ago but the 538 who really 
matter will vote monday 
thats when the electoral college meets in an antiquated and much 
maligned constitutional ritual that has survived for two centuries 
expect no surprise here bush should defeat democrat michael 
dukakis by 426 votes to 112 votes give or take a faithless 
elector 
in state capitals around the nation on monday the electors will 
meet to cast their votes and sign half a dozen documents swearing 
theyve done their duty 
this sets the stage for the final ceremony in a joint session of 
congress on jan 4 when vice president george bush as president of 
the senate will open the ballots and anounce the results and 
formally declare himself the presidentelect 
the political parties in each state pick prospective electors 
one for each congressman and senator the state has 
while voters on nov 8 may have thought they were voting for one 
of the presidential candidates they really were casting their 
ballots for the republican or democratic slate of electors in their 
state the party that wins a state sends its electors to the meeting 
set by law for monday 
among those who have the honor and duty are some of the vice 
presidents relatives son neil bush in colorado and brother 
prescott s bush jr in connecticut 
i think it was a nice honor to get to cast a vote for my 
dad neil bush a denver oilman said itll be nice to be a 
small footnote in history 
among others with the duty are bushs designated white house 
chief of staff new hampshire gov john sununu penn state football 
coach joe paterno who seconded bushs nomination at the republican 
national convention is a pennsylvania elector but most are state 
party workers or insiders rewarded for their labors and state 
officeholders such as california gov george deukmejian and alabama 
gov guy hunt 
in the 10 states and the district of columbia that were carried 
by michael dukakis democratic electors will vote 
electors are expected to vote for their partys presidential 
nominee and vice presidential nominee but in this unique american 
system they dont have to and therein lies the potential for 
mischief or intrigue 
in nearly 200 years eight electors have broken their pledge and 
voted for someone else 
the lure of making some dramatic point and gaining widespread if 
fleeting notice endures a minnesota elector bill davis treasurer 
of the state democraticfarmlabor party has said he may cast a 
symbolic vote for jesse jackson for vice president instead of 
democratic sen lloyd bentsen the partys nominee 
and this year with the furor over dan quayles selection as 
bushs republican vice presidential running mate still fresh in 
memory some electors have been getting letters urging them to 
dump quayle and cast vice presidential ballots for someone else 
dan quayle does not have to be the next vice president just 
ask the framers of the constitution who devised the electoral 
college precisely to deal with the current predicament law 
journalist david a kaplan and new york lawyer gary s simon wrote 
in a new york times opinionpage article last month 
such a case for rests on the argument that the founding fathers 
envisioned the electors as truly deliberative of course the 
founding fathers didnt know about the emergence of the two dominant 
parties or a nation attuned to instantaneous communication when 
they added the provision during the constitutional convention of 
1787 in philadelphia they saw it as an elite group of wise men to 
be trusted with the decision 
in fact about half the states now have laws rquiring the 
electors to vote as pledged but experts say the laws might not pass 
a constitutional test and may be unenforceable 
in the past some have proposed scrapping the entire electoral 
college system and provide for direct election a middleground 
proposal is to keep the electoral system but do away with electors 
that is award electoral votes automatically 
but all efforts to make such changes have fallen short in 
congress the last serious effort was in 1979 when the change won a 
majority in the senate but fell well short of the twothirds needed 
for a consitutional amendment 
the move was opposed by a conservatives by small states that 
feared they would be overlooked in campaigns without electoral 
votes and some black leaders and other minorities who shared 
similar concerns 
former sen birch bayh of indiana who was unseated in 1980 by 
quayle sponsored the change he argued that the system is 
undemocratic because it poses the potential for a candidate to be 
elected without winning the popular vote 
that has happened john quincy adams in 1824 rutherford b hayes 
in 1876 and benjamin harrison in 1888 
but dont look for it from the electors of 1988 
theyre going to do their duty as the people instructed 
said republican national committee press secretary albert maruggi

a communist party politburo member said in remarks 
published saturday that soviets still are afraid of democracy and 
openness despite more than three years of reform 
we talk about political transformations but how difficult it 
is to part with the old power to which we are accustomed 
alexander n yakovlev said in the ural mountain city of perm 
we still cannot imagine that genuine peoples power will be 
simpler more reliable and of course more responsible democracy 
glasnost and differences of opinion still frighten us as if every 
one of us constantly lives in agreement with himself and always 
thinks in comfortable cliches yakovlev said 
can you really call a person a person if he doesnt have his 
own opinions he said 
his remarks to regional party officials were published by the 
communist party newspaper pravda 
yakovlev is regarded as a theoretician of gorbachevs reforms and 
the closest adviser to the soviet president on the politburo 
he called for an end to wageleveling the practice of giving 
people the same pay regardless of the quality of the work they do 
gorbachev has encouraged the practice of paying more for better work 
in an effort to get soviets to work harder and produce better goods 
yakovlev said that practice could be encouraged through the 
cooperative movement which allows soviets working privately to 
provide goods and services scarce in the staterun economy without 
adhering to the official price and wage structure 
without the concept of pay according to work he said the 
construction of socialism is a utopia without it society a person 
is alienated from property and power 
yakovlev said the new government structure approved last month 
will have to earn the respect of soviet citizens 
last month the supreme soviet parliament approved gorbachevs 
plan for a new congress of peoples deputies that will include 
members selected from the communist party trade unions and other 
organizations the new congress in turn will choose a smaller more 
active supreme soviet 
gorbachevs plan also calls for a stronger presidency 
gorbachev who became communist party chief in 1985 has said 
economic restructuring is needed in soviet society he also has 
espoused glasnost or greater openness on selected issues

former sen john tower presidentelect bushs 
choice as defense secretary should let recent reforms to the 
pentagons weaponbuying system take hold instead promising more 
sweeping changes says outgoing defense secretary frank c carlucci 
tower also should fight as hard as he can for a 2 percent 
increase in the pentagons budget and not talk about accepting 
less because anything less jeopardizes the nations security and 
the future of the allvolunteer force carlucci said 
the last thing the defense department needs is somebody to come 
in and yank the procurement system out by the roots again and say 
were going to reform it or change it carlucci said 
the best reform for the procurement system is stability 
predictability the blueprint is laid out weve made a large 
number of changes in the procurement system real changes are taking 
place in the procurement system and i am proud of them 
carlucci was interviewed last week in his pentagon office as he 
awaited bushs announcement of the man who would replace him 
the 58yearold defense chief who said he was looking forward to 
finding a job in the private sector but had yet to do so talked at 
length about what he considered his achievements as well as the 
problems he foresaw for tower 
of the former he claimed a measure of credit for 
guiding the process and setting priorities in late 1987 in 
slashing the pentagon budget plans to comply with a white house 
deficit compromise with congress 
we took it cuts in places the services didnt like and lost a 
secretary of the navy in the process carlucci said referring to 
the resignation of navy secretary james webb over a decision to 
retire 16 warships 
protecting reflagged kuwaiti oil tankers in the persian gulf 
carlucci noted he had just returned from a visit to the middle east 
and our standing could not be higher 
the fact is that we got a high degree of cooperation from the 
moderate arab states the persian gulf work has been a major 
achievement 
taking a calm measured approach to the disclosure of a 
wideranging fraud investigation among pentagon contractors and 
private consultants carlucci said he had instituted a total 
quality management program to impress on contractors the need for 
quality products as well as ethical conduct 
were looking at more innovative ways to base competition on 
quality and track record as opposed to pure price he said 
the defense secretary also cited success in establishing a good 
rapport with his soviet counterparts impressing upon leaders 
around the world the dangers posed by the proliferation of 
longrange missiles convincing congress to pass legislation 
allowing obsolete military bases to be closed and getting congress 
through a silly season earlier this year when some politicians 
were demanding the military be used to seal the nations borders 
against drugs 
weve got the dod role in drug interdiction sorted out in a way 
that it is manageable instead of having us seal the borders in 45 
days or whatever the hell it was and shoot everybody who comes in 
on the problem side carlucci said tower would have to fight for 
a larger pentagon budget help develop arms control strategy and 
strengthen the north atlantic treaty organization while helping 
european allies resist the seductive appeal of soviet arms control 
proposals 
if bush and tower cant convince congress to approve a 2 percent 
real growth increase in the fiscal 1990 budget the only way to make 
further cuts sensibly would be to reduce the size of the armed 
forces carlucci said 
if navy deployments are lengthened or tours for soldiers in 
europe increased what does that do for recruitment and 
retention carlucci asked 
its not a question of we cant afford it if you look at the 
domestic programs they continue to go up at a rate of about 8 
percent therefore using that yardstick i see nothing wrong with 2 
percent in defense 
asked then if he thought a democratic congress would actually go 
along with an increase carlucci replied certainly if you dont 
try its not politically doable with the congress my view is 
that youve got to make your case 
carlucci who replaced caspar w weinberger as defense secretary 
for the last 14 months of the reagan administration said he had 
enjoyed the position but found it truly was a fulltime job 
on a perhour basis i make about as much as my babysitter 
he joked adding the secretarys salary of 99500 is lousy

the us decision to establish dialogue with 
the palestinian liberation organization ends 13 years of officially 
shunning the plo a period which began not long after its leader 
visited the united nations toting a gun 
but with the long and bitter tug of war over whether to talk to 
each other ended the united states and the plo now begin a debate 
over peace itself as a wary israel watches 
the existence of israel its right to exist as a nation was at 
the heart of the american cold shoulder 
that policy was halted last week when plo chairman yasser arafat 
finally said the right words in geneva meeting a threestep test 
set by the united states 
he renounced terrorism 
he accepted guidelines set by two united nations resolutions 
which implicity recognize israel and hold out the prospect for 
landforpeace negotiations 
and casting aside previous ambiguities he recognized the 
right of all parties concerned in the middle east conflict to exist 
in peace and security including the state of palestine israel 
and other neighbors 
the united state had previously rejected other plo formulations 
including a declaration by the palestinian national council the plo 
parliament in exile and in arafats united nations speech 
but when arafat revised his statements a day after the un 
speech secretary of state george p shultz promptly ended the us 
policy of shunning all substantive contact with the plo and said 
dialogue would begin 
it was a far call from the november 1974 day when arafat a 
pistol strapped to his hip walked to the un podium in new york to 
declare i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom 
fighters gun 
or the day in august 1979 when andrew young resigned as us 
ambassador to the united nations after holding unauthorized talks 
with plo representatives 
the notalk policy was established in 1975 by thensecretary of 
state henry kissinger 
the two un security council resolutions which kissinger 
demanded the plo accept sprang from wars israel had fought against 
invading arab neighbors 
resolution 242 was adopted after the 1967 war in which israel 
seized the arab west bank and gaza strip territories 
it decries acquisition of territory by war and speaks of the 
need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every state in 
the area can live in peace and security the resolution calls for 
israel to remove its forces from occupied territories and for arab 
states to respect israels independence 
resolution 338 adopted during the 1973 arabisraeli war called 
for a ceasefire and implementation of resolution 242 
both resolutions speak of a negotiated settlement 
the plo was created by the arab league in 1964 by welding 
together a number of competing palestinian groups including 
arafats al fatah by 1970 it was conducting guerilla and terrorist 
war against israel from bases inside neighboring jordan 
jordans king hussein in 1970 used his army to expel the plo and 
its major elements moved to lebanon upsetting that countrys 
delicate christianmuslim balance and helping ignite the lebanese 
civil war 
terrorist attacks on israel continued across lebanons southern 
border and in june 1982 israel invaded hoping to expel the plo 
at that time the united states accepted plo help in evacuating 
americans but officials said no substantive talks were involved 
on sept 1 1982 us forces supervised the plos evacuation of 
beirut and the organization moved to its current headquarters in 
tunisia 
plo terrorist attacks continued through most of the 1980s and in 
october 1985 the united states blamed plo elements for the attack on 
the cruise ship achille lauro in the mediterranean during which leon 
klinghoffer an american jew confined to a wheelchair was murdered 
despite worldwide condemnation of such acts the plo found 
growing support for its ultimate aim the establishment of a 
palestinian state in the occupied territories 
arab leaders in 1972 had declared the plo the only legitimate 
representative of palestinians and two years later the un 
officially recognized the organization granting it observer status 
although no official contacts were allowed the plo was permitted 
to open an information office in washington 
in 1987 congress ordered the closing of the plos washington and 
new york offices on grounds the plo was a terrorist group a 
state department attempt to close the plos un office ended up in 
court and the case has not been resoloved 
last month shultz refused to allow arafat to enter the united 
states because of plo terrorist activities a move that led to the 
shift of the general assembly debate to geneva 
but 18 days after he denied arafat the visa shultz announced 
president reagans decision to open substantive dialogue with 
the plo a change in us foreign policy that brought exultation in 
the arab world and shock and disappointment in israel

guatemalan farm workers have sent word 
back home that this dusty community east of lake okeechobee is the 
promised land prompting a torrent of refugees that some locals want 
to stop 
everyone told me there is work in the fields here every day of 
the year said rafael baltazar 26 who arrived this month after 
picking crops in california and north carolina this is where i 
want to stay forever 
but the last thing many longtime residents of this lowincome 
farming community want is more guatemalans 
with the towns population of 5500 already made up of nearly 
3000 guatemalans some residents are grumbling about the 
competition for jobs the possible drain on public services and the 
feeling that they are taking over 
the resentment against them is building said pete marovich 
owner of a fertilizer business and outgoing president of the chamber 
of commerce theres simply too many here for the town to absorb 
still more guatemalans mostly kanjobal indians who speak a 
dialect even spanish speakers from their own country cant 
understand flow into indiantown to escape the violence in their 
central american homeland 
word of mouth and letters from relatives and friends already here 
send out the message that yearround jobs providing free 
transportation are plentiful for those willing to pick oranges 
grapefruits tomatoes cucumbers and cabbage 
smugglers called coyotes charge the guatemalans upwards of 
1000 to sneak them across the us border into california arizona 
and texas 
federal officials say about 300 to 400 guatemalans cross the 
border in this way each day the coyotes charge an additional 
500 to transport refugees to farms in florida most to indiantown 
and immokalee in southwest florida 
us immigration and naturalization service officials who 
estimate 30000 to 40000 guatemalans are in florida say most who 
entered illegally have applied for amnesty to work in the united 
states 
new immigration policies enacted this week may slow the flood of 
central americans into florida the measure would sharply limit the 
number of people granted asylum but the flood has already swamped 
indiantown 
the blacks that live around here used to get all the work but 
the farms want those guatemalans said stetson gary a cabbage 
farm work contractor guatemalans are the hardest damn workers 
ive ever seen theyre like machines 
often criticized for its role in helping the guatemalans settle 
in indiantown is holy cross roman catholic church which began its 
efforts with the first arrivals in 1982 
it operates a refugee school a thrift shop and a service center 
to help new arrivals complete immigration papers learn english and 
find housing 
if the american people want to help them lets help them in 
their own country said lt floyd mcallister ranking officer of 
the martin county sheriffs substation in indiantown church 
officials create problems by giving them legal assistance 
church workers say the 30 refugees who arrive every month are 
diligent gentle people who arent being given a chance by an 
intolerant community 
there has always been resistance in indiantown its not a 
place that adapts well to change said yolanda martinez a staff 
member at the church service center 
it was the same way when blacks came and mexicans came she 
said they love them out picking the oranges but they dont like 
to see them walking around the street 
other church workers remember when actor paul newman donated a 
bus for the refugee school in 1985 and days later it was pelted 
with rocks by white teenagers 
many of the refugee families live in an area called blue camp 
consisting of rows of tiny shacks and oneroom apartments often 
without electricity or running water 
with no public housing in indiantown some landlords charge the 
guatemalans as much as 300 a month 
the refugee area has been the site of a 20 percent increase in 
police and emergency calls in the past year county officials said 
the most serious crime came last month when a guatemalan was 
arrested in the rape of 5yearold boy 
its usually never anything big lots of fights wife beating 
and it can normally be traced to alcohol said sheriffs deputy 
brian roberts they drink like crazy that more than anything 
turns people here against them 
at the tiny post office where refugees send money home so family 
members can make the trip the postmaster refuses to help anyone who 
cant speak english or is not accompanied by an interpreter 
theyre in this country now they should learn how to speak 
the language said postmaster ron yates 
despite growing resentment among longtime residents there have 
been no formal complaints from local governments against the 
guatemalans said ins deputy district director george waldroup 
i say they should all be rounded up and checked out said 
marovich of the chamber of commerce if they dont belong here 
they should be sent back to wherever they came from

ten years ago three days before christmas dr 
robert stein was getting ready for bed when the phone rang it was a 
routine call for a medical examiner police had found two bodies 
but there was nothing routine about the case that began unfolding 
that night when stein was called to the home of john wayne gacy 
stein looked out a window and grimaced at the snow that was 
burying chicago then dressed warmly for the drive to norwood park 
township just east of ohare international airport 
he walked into gacys ranchstyle home and caught a whiff of 
trouble 
it was the odor of death stein said recalling that two 
evidence technicians had found two decaying bodies in the crawl 
space 
i said oh brother lets stop right here i was convinced 
there were more bodies gacy later drew a diagram on a piece of 
paper and showed that there were many many bodies 
in the crawl space alone 29 bodies were found four more were 
dumped in nearby rivers 
ten years ago this week gacy successful building contractor 
decorated jaycee amateur clown democratic activist became king 
of the mass murderers apprehended in this country 
gacy told police he strangled all but one of his 33 male victims 
by wrapping rope around their necks and twisting it with a stick he 
had sex with some of them before killing them the murders were 
committed over a threeyear period beginning in 1975 
in 1980 he was convicted of 33 murders more than anyone before 
or since 
gacy 46 received death sentences for 12 of the killings and 
life in prison for each of the remaining 21 in september the 
illinois supreme court upheld the convictions and the sentences 
execution is scheduled for jan 11 but is almost certain to be 
delayed by appeals illinois last execution was in 1962 
today gacy sits in a 46squarefoot cell on death row at menard 
correctional center in chester a small town in southern illinois 
he is allowed to exercise an hour a day and to spend another 60 
minutes in the prison law library 
hes not a disciplinary problem says nic howell spokesman 
for the state department of corrections he was painting 
landscapes the last time i saw him 
gacys name surfaced briefly in this years presidential campaign 
when a pamphlet distributed by illinois republicans claimed that 
gacy would have been eligible for weekend passes had he committed 
his crimes in massachusetts under gov michael dukakis 
administration 
dukakis labeled the pamphlet garbage and gacy later wrote to 
state gop officials complaining about the sleazy tactic 
at gacys request corrections officials no longer relay oral 
requests for interviews 
the uneasy memories of gacy and the crimes that stunned the world 
remain close to the surface 
what i especially remember was the ghoulishness of people on 
the outside of the house said stein who is still cook county 
medical examiner and owns two gacy paintings just like counting 
down the seconds in a basketball game they were counting up the 
bodies that were pulled from the ground 
gacy a chicago native lived in springfield and iowa before 
returning in the early 1970s to start his own business specializing 
in remodeling work at retail stores he often hired teenage boys 
joseph kozenczak chief of detectives in des plaines who is now 
police chief had been looking for robert piest a 15yearold who 
disappeared after telling his mother he was going to see gacy about 
a summer job 
a few days later the detective got a search warrant for gacys 
home 
we never suspected we were in the middle of mass murders we 
were looking for one kid kozenczak said 
eight of the bodies were so badly decomposed they were never 
identified 
at a funeral where authorities hoped they might get clues to the 
identities by watching the mourners this was the final prayer 
offered for them 
lord you alone know the names of these brothers names you 
have written on the palm of your hand we praise and thank you for 
the gift of life you gave them we are sorry for the violence which 
took away their mortal lives

dennis duke spends years nurturing firs on 
his christmas tree farm in western kentucky across the river at a 
factory in southern indiana curtis keen can snap out one in 10 
minutes 
they both represent rival camps in a multimilliondollar industry 
fighting to win a place in the living rooms of some 61 million 
american households 
on a cold december day families bundle up for an outing on 
dukes farm youngsters romp while their parents search for the 
perfect tree 
people like to be sure theyre getting a fresh tree said 
duke who has grown trees for nine years 
dukes trees sell from 3 to 5 a foot for 40 hell dig up a 
white pine and cover the roots in a burlap bag for replanting after 
christmas he charges 10 a foot to dig spruces 
forty miles away in evansville ind keen plant manager of 
hudson valley tree inc is finished with christmas 1988 hes 
thinking about manufacturing trees for 1989 
at hudson valley no christmas carols are played over the 
loudspeaker to get workers in the holiday spirit keen has 
considered the idea but thinks some workers might find the music 
distracting 
besides its hard to hear anything above the racket of machinery 
as 160 workers twist pieces of flameretardant polyvinyl chloride 
pvc together with green twine making branches that are blue 
green or a combination for spruce trees and box them up they also 
make wreaths and garlands 
duke worries mostly about insects or bad weather keens 
challenge is getting all the right pieces in a box 
around the country real trees have a slight edge over artificial 
ones according to the national christmas tree association in 
milwaukee wis it says 38 percent of americas households use real 
trees while 33 percent prefer the artificial kind the remaining 29 
percent have no trees 
christmas trees are grown in all 50 states including hawaii 
but the majority come from a handful of states michigan and oregon 
are tied for first place each growing 6 million annually the 
association says other top producers are minnesota wisconsin 
california and north carolina 
sales of real trees are expected to generate more than 341 
million this year said david baumann executive director of the 
association which does not collect figures for artificial tree 
sales 
sales of real trees have been healthy this season baumann said 
noting that growers in southern florida are reporting increases of 
15 percent to 20 percent over 1987 the number of chooseandcut 
christmas tree farms has grown from 1000 in the 1960s to 5000 
today he said 
real christmas trees are selling for 3 to 525 a foot this 
year baumann said artificial trees cost from 20 to 50 for 
cheaper versions and from 80 to 300 for better quality ones 
they wont know its artificial unless you tell them reads a 
tag on a 75foot softneedled douglas fir at hudson valley that 
retails for 229 comes with a 10year guarantee and has 75 
individual branches 
a 14foot version sells for about 999 and has 5624 branches 
i tell our people how important it is to get every branch in 
the box keen said if people are setting up a tree at christmas 
time and they dont have a pole or branches are missing its kind 
of depressing to the children 
hudson valley which has its home plant in newburgh ny has 
net sales in excess of 25 million said irwin katz vice president 
of finance people are switching to artificial trees he said for 
safety and convenience 
tradition is an argument but thats up to you real trees get 
needles in your vacuum cleaner i dont think you get them out of 
the carpet until spring he said with ours it folds right up 
goes into a carton and you can use it next year

the plo having made a series of 
concessions to lure the united states into a dialogue believes 
israel is now isolated and an international conference to negotiate 
a comprehensive middle east peace is on the horizon 
there is an international moral force facing israel now 
palestine liberation organization spokesman ahmed abdulrahman said 
saturday that moral pressure he said is what led the united 
states to change its policy 
the plos moves began last month when its parliamentinexile 
the palestine national council declared an independent palestinian 
state based on un resolutions on the mideast plo chief yasser 
arafat then set about meeting all three us conditions for opening 
talks with the organization 
washington had demanded that the organization clearly recognize 
israel renounce terrorism and accept un resolutions 242 and 338 
which recognize the right of all nations in the region to live 
within secure borders 
when the united states rejected arafats speech to the un 
general assembly on tuesday as not clear enough he came back a day 
later with another more explicit declaration 
washington then abruptly reversed its longstanding policy of 
refusing to deal with the plo and two days later opened what it 
called a dialogue not negotiations with the group 
the plos priority now arafat told reporters saturday is to 
push forward with the international conference to be held very 
soon 
the change in the us position caused shock in israel prime 
minister yitzhak shamir rejects the idea of an international 
conference or any talks with what it calls a terrorist 
organization 
the plo has opened a new era an era of peace abdulrahman 
said the israelis have failed to enter it we put an agenda of 
peace on the table 
the revival of the middle east peace process moribund for 
the past two years is a direct result of the yearlong intefadeh 
arabic for uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip that has resulted in more than 320 palestinian deaths 
thirteen israelis also have died 
more than anything else the rockthrowing youths in the streets 
of the territories and israels tough response has won new sympathy 
for the palestinian cause 
as yasser abdrabbou leader of the plo delegation that met with 
us ambassador to tunis robert h pelletreau jr put it we are 
here in the name of the intefadeh 
american officials in tunis refused to make any substantive 
comment about the 90minute meeting friday refering all queries to 
washington but in the palestinian view there is no distinction 
between dialogue and negotiations they say the talks 
whatever they are called mean recognition of palestinian rights 
the only suitable framework for working out an overall mideast 
peace the palestinians say is the longdiscussed international 
conference involving all parties directly concerned including the 
plo and the five permanent members of the un security council 
our impression is that the americans are serious and that they 
understand that this dialogue should lead to a comprehensive peace 
in the middle east abdulrahman said of the tunis talks 
arafat said he hoped washington now could be neutral in its peace 
efforts 
we started this dialogue according to their us desire 
the chairman said we will continue with this attitude because we 
know that america is one of two superpowers and also one of five 
permanent members of the security council no peace can be settled 
without their participation and their efforts 
the palestinians say the next usplo meeting will not take 
place until after presidentelect george bush takes office jan 20 
both abdulrahman and abdrabbou said they expected an international 
peace conference to get under way soon though neither said when 
the plos acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 in 
abdulrahmans words the passport to the international 
conference 
the plo now has the official ear of washington and is counting 
on washington to get the attention of israel 
the decision for war or peace in the middle east is made in 
washington not in tel aviv abdulrahman said

president reagan pledged today to work on 
reforming the nations budget process after leaving office calling 
the effort a vital campaign 
the budget system simply has no control and no internal 
discipline and thats the problem reagan said in his weekly 
radio address delivered from the oval office 
with less than five weeks left in his presidency reagan used his 
fiveminute address to argue once again that the president needs 
greater authority to limit spending in order to curtail the 
countrys deficit 
in the 1988 fiscal year which ended sept 30 a 1551 billion 
deficit was recorded under the grammrudman budget balancing law a 
100 billion deficit target has been set for the 1990 fiscal year 
reagan blamed congress for getting the nation into its red ink 
dilemma saying every dime of deficit spending has been mandated 
by congress 
emphasizing that he believes the deficit can be solved without 
raising taxes reagan also said such spending woes could be avoided 
if a laundry list of changes in the budget process were enacted 
the president has argued repeatedly during his white house tenure 
for the proposals such as the presidential authority to veto 
individual items in appropriations bills a constitutional amendment 
requiring a balanced budget and granting the president authority 
not to spend money that congress has appropriated among others 
congress must reform its faulty budget process and we need a 
balanced budget amendment to the constitution so that the federal 
government does not spend more than it takes in reagan said 
after i leave office next month i will campaign for these 
reforms so today im asking you to join me in this vital campaign 
for the future by making your voice heard if we achieve these 
reforms the deficit will be ancient history in no time reagan 
said 
reagan is required under the law to submit another budget on jan 
9 and it is expected that he will include his budget reform 
recommendations in that spending plan 
presidentelect george bush has the option of scrapping reagans 
entire budget if he wants and submitting his won proposal after he

khaoidang thailand ap cambodian refugees who lost their 
limbs in a decade of war against vietnam competed in a special 
athletic competition on saturday pushing themselves to the limit on 
crutches and wheelchairs 
a young man with a wooden right leg jogged into a soccer field 
with a torch to inaugurate the event at this refugee camp where 55 
disabled veterans competed in 11 sports most are the victims of 
landmines strewn over vast areas of embattled cambodia 
several thousand refugees watched the games standing or sitting 
in the dirt of this camp of bamboo and thatchroof huts at the base 
of a mountain in the eastern province of prachinburi 
for the second straight year suk sam 22 won the dash on 
crutches leaving his closest competitor far behind on the 
dirtswept field the guerrilla soldier lost his leg in 1986 when a 
mine exploded as he was fighting vietnamese troops that invaded 
cambodia in 1978 
sports keep you healthy and i participated for the honor of my 
camp said the mildmannered young man i felt very sorry about 
losing my leg but i realized that many other people lost their 
limbs too and i was doing my duty to my country 
suk sam said that after he lost his leg fighting prevented him 
from being evacuated from the front for six months 
ching pan 29 who won the wheelchair race lost both legs to a 
landmine in a fierce 1982 battle for pnom malai opposite the 
central thai border 
i thought i would be no 1 in a wheelchair and i wanted to 
find out if i would succeed said ching pan 
prizes for the winners included scarves tshirts books sweets 
and other items donated by foreign relief workers 
the fourth annual competition was organized by operation handicap 
international the frenchbased agency that sponsors rehabilitation 
services for thousands of handicapped refugee in camps along the 
thaicambodian border 
the athletes competing saturday were brought to khaoidang from 
other unaided refugee camps 
khaoidang is neutral but the other camps are controlled by 
cambodian guerrillas including the communist khmer rouge the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front and the 
forces of cambodias former leader prince norodom sihanouk 
the khmer rouge allowed athletes to leave only its site 8 camp 
which is unsponsored aid officials say the khmer rouge who 
killed hundreds of thousands when they led cambodia in 197578 are 
holding refugees as virtual captives in their three other camps 
vietnam which has promised to withdraw its 120000 troops by 
1990 is supporting the cambodian government against the 
chinesebacked khmer rouge and other rebels 
the guerrillas are all separated for political reasons but 
some of the refugees dont care about these differences said 
myriam houtart a belgian medical coordinator for operation handicap 
and an olympics organizer all these people are within the same 
walls here and there is no fighting they just enjoy the games 
houtart said the handicapped tend to be separated from the other 
refugees she said some camp administrators give the amputees 
special food and other items but after that they dont want to 
hear about them any more

for james brown the godfather of soul soul 
brother no 1 the selfproclaimed pope of music it has finally 
come to this six years in a south carolina prison for trying to run 
over two policemen 
just two years after a comeback run browns life is a mess the 
man praised by presidents for his good works cannot stay out of 
trouble the singer of love ballads was charged this year with 
trying to kill his wife its his third tumultuous marriage the 
crusader against drugs apparently has a pcp habit 
obviously there is trouble within the confines of james brown 
the man his attorney albert buddy dallas said last week 
its unbelievable said robert flash gordon of augusta 
who worked for the singerbusinessmans three radio stations in the 
1970s before brown lost the stations and much of what he owned in 
tax and other money troubles 
i cant imagine anything like this happening to him gordon 
said friday from augusta the day his friend checked into prison 
brown 55 has shown little sign of slowing down either on or 
off the stage he still performs around the world he still makes 
records 
brown was arrested at least seven times in the past year and a 
half including twice in a bizarre 20 hours in september that 
culminated in thursdays sentence in aiken sc 
on sept 24 brown led police on a twostate chase until they 
shot out his tires according to blood tests he was strung out on 
pcp a hallucinogen known as angel dust after posting bond he 
was arrested for drunken driving 
his trial in georgia on 10 misdemeanors stemming from the chase 
is scheduled for jan 23 
this is not the real james brown said dallas his attorney 
of four years browns problems he said originated during a time 
of domestic difficulties with his wife adrienne he just cant 
get it to smooth out 
i programmed three radio stations for him gordon recalled 
he didnt allow anything like that if you even had any alcohol or 
anything like that you lost your job i dont know what has 
happened to him 
longtime employee fred daviss saw him in september he had 
passed the point of no return daviss said he had trouble 
speaking his wife was hiding the car keys from him i pleaded with 
her to get him some help 
in the past brown made it on his own jailed for auto theft at 
15 the former shoeshine boy got out and formed a singing group that 
became his famous flames in 1956 he released please please 
please james brown was on his way 
a string of hits i got you i feel good papas got a 
brand new bag cold sweat defined 1960s soul music with 
frenetic repeating guitar rhythms bulletsharp horn blasts and 
browns inimitable yowls and growls nothing before or since 
sounded like it with his sweat his jetblack pompadour and his 
constant shuffling legsplitting dancing nobody looked like james 
brown either 
brown took a step toward the political with songs such as say 
it loud im black and im proud and his influence was large 
his tv appearances following the assassination of martin luther king 
jr were credited by president johnson with helping avoid further 
violence he urged kids not to get messed up in drugs 
brown later tried to ride the disco tide with only partial 
success financial problems followed the irs says he still owes 6 
million 
but the late 80s brought nostalgia for browns music and unlike 
many rock legends the godfather of soul was still out there 
working his living in america from the film rocky iv won 
a grammy in 1987 his second 
but 1987 also saw browns life beginning to crack he was getting 
arrested for driving violations assaulting police drugs before 
he had gotten probation and fines not this time in the south 
carolina courtroom 
i dont want to take too much of your time sir brown told 
aiken county judge hubert long last week but im fighting for my 
life 
james brown the man wants to do right he continued ive 
wanted to do right all my life ill do anything i can not to go to 
prison so i can continue my work 
ive considered that youve done a lot of good the judge 
said but ive got to consider some of the bad 
brown will be eligible for parole in 18 months earlier if he 
behaves himself 
james brown is a survivor dallas said we have not even 
touched the depths of james brown yet this is a setback it is not 
the end i dont think people want it to be the end

president reagan contended saturday that the 
nations deficit could be ancient history in no time if the 
president had more power over the budget process 
reagan who leaves office in less than five weeks used his 
weekly radio address to blame congress once again for the nations 
deficit spending habits 
every dime of deficit spending has been mandated by congress 
reagan said in the address delivered from the oval office 
under the constitution only congress can spend money the 
president cant appropriate a penney reagan said 
in the 1988 fiscal year which ended sept 30 the nation 
recorded a 1551 billion deficit under the grammrudman budget 
balancing law a 100 billion deficit target has been set for the 
1990 fiscal year 
the verdict is in the current system does not work reagan 
said 
reagan did not mention his successor presidentelect bush but 
he did argue that the nations red ink woes can be solved without 
raising taxes a pledge bush made in his campaign 
reagan is required under the law to submit another budget on jan 
9 and it is expected that he will include many of his budget reform 
recommendations in that spending plan 
saying the only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the 
increases in spending reagan said his final budget will reduce 
the deficit target by some 35 billion for the 1990 fiscal year and 
meet the grammrudman target 
the president also contended that his budget plan will do so 
without touching social security or raising taxes 
economic growth will increase revenues by 80 billion without 
new taxes just by holding spending increases to less than 80 
billion we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track for a 
balanced budget by 1993 reagan said 
bush has the option of scrapping reagans entire budget if he 
wants and submitting his won proposal after he takes office jan 20 
bush has declined to say whether he will submit his own plan but 
has said he wants to open negotiations with congress over ways to 
reduce the deficit 
as he has many times in during his two terms reagan used his 
fiveminute address to argue for an array of changes in the budget 
process many of them grant more power to the president rather to 
congress and have therefore met stiff opposition on capitol hill 
they include presidential authority to veto individual items in 
appropriations bills a constitutional amendment requiring a 
balanced budget and granting the president authority not to spend 
money that congress has appropriated among others 
congress must reform its faulty budget process and we need a 
balanced budget amendment to the constitution so that the federal 
government does not spend more than it takes in reagan said 
after i leave office next month i will campaign for these 
reforms so today im asking you to join me in this vital campaign 
for the future by making your voice heard if we achieve these 
reforms the deficit will be ancient history in no time reagan 
said

no im not asking you to pay more taxes i think you already pay 
plenty and those trying to tax away more of your hardearned money 
should be ashamed of themselves instead what i need is for you to 
help me fix a budget system that has broken down 
first let me describe the problem and then ill tell you what we 
can do about it the record is not good in all but eight of the 
last 56 years the federal government has run a deficit and every 
dime of deficit spending over these many years has been mandated by 
congress 
you see under the constitution only congress can spend money 
the president cant appropriate a penny 
up until 1974 the president did have one effective way to 
control spending he could refuse to spend money appropriated by 
congress and this ability to impound funds was routinely used by 
such presidents as thomas jefferson and franklin roosevelt 
in fact three of my predecessors presidents kennedy johnson 
and nixon used this power each year to reduce federal spending by 
between five and eight percent during my presidency that would 
have reduced the deficit by billions each year 
but all that changed in 1974 in the 1974 budget and impoundment 
control act congress stripped the president of his ability to 
refuse to spend funds let me try to describe the effect of this 
change suppose the rules of hockey were changed and the goalie was 
removed from the game would you be surprised if hockey scores 
quadrupled 
well since congress changed the budget law federal spending has 
in fact quadrupled and it has come right out of your pocket 
and under the new rules the deficit has taken off for a quarter 
century the average annual federal deficit was just seventenths of 
one percent of gross national product 
then in the mid1970s congress changed the rules and since then 
the deficit has been running five times higher than before the 
verdict is in the current system does not work 
can you imagine if a head of a household or a business were 
forced to spend every dime that was budgeted even if savings were 
available 
well thats the situation the president is in now all he can do 
is ask congress to take back funds it appropriated since 1982 i 
have requested congress to take back unneeded funds more than 460 
times and 83 percent of the time they refused 
most of the time they didnt even bring it up for a vote they 
simply said no spend it all 
during my two terms congress appropriated over 100 billion more 
on domestic spending than i requested but this is typical 
between 1976 and 1987 a period spanning three presidents in 
which we ran a deficit each year congress spent an average of 30 
billion per year more than the president requested 
the budget system simply has no control and no internal 
discipline and thats the problem now heres what must be done 
to solve the deficit problem it is essential that we restore the 
constitutional balance and repair the system we need to give the 
president greater authority to limit spending that means the 
lineitem veto which 43 governors have and also greater authority 
for a president to return unneeded funds to congress 
congress must reform its faulty budget process and we need a 
balanced budget amendment to the constitution so the federal 
government does not spending more than it takes in 
after i leave office next month i will campaign for these 
reforms so today im asking you to join me in this vital campaign 
for the future by making your voice heard if we achieve these 
reforms then a deficit will be ancient history in no time 
what wont solve the problem is raising taxes in fact over the 
last 40 years the record is this on average every 100 of new 
taxes has led to 158 of new spending and since 1981 yearly tax 
revenues have gone up sharply by some 375 billion but that hasnt 
balanced the budget because spending has gone up 450 billion and 
less than onethird of that went for defense 
yes weve heard a lot about cuts but by there terms even when 
spending goes up they call it a cut for example medicare spending 
which weve been charged with cutting in fact has doubled 
the only way to reduce the deficit is by limiting the increase in 
spending and thats what my last budget will do without touching 
social security or raising taxes our fiscal year 1990 budget will 
reduce the deficit by some 35 billion more than meeting the 
grammrudman target 
you see economic growth will increase revenues by 80 billion 
without new taxes just by holding spending increases to less than 
80 billion we will reduce the deficit and put ourselves on track 
for a balanced budget by 1993 and with your help that will be done 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

george bush has five weeks to go until he 
assumes command but his offhand remarks and newsconference 
performances are providing an early glimpse into the policies and 
style he is likely to pursue as chief executive 
bush has backed off one campaign pledge completely his promise 
to name vice presidentelect dan quayle to head the nations drug 
enforcement effort 
and he has modified other campaign positions in light of changing 
political realities such as his vow to not deal with the palestine 
liberation organization 
in the area of relations with the soviets bush has displayed 
more caution than was evident in his campaign utterances urging a 
goslow approach both toward a summit with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev and to new talks to cut strategic arms 
and on the federal budget bush has been shifting his stance 
first hinting that he would not submit his own budget this winter 
then saying that he recognized he must take the initiative 
in areas of style bush has displayed a certain zest in his 
frequent encounters with reporters and has suggested he will hold 
more frequent news conferences than president reagan 
but he also issued a warning no more answering of shouted 
questions at phototaking sessions once he takes office a tactic 
that had become a standard practice of reporters covering the reagan 
white house 
meanwhile the vice president has been meeting with scores of 
individuals and organization in an effort to reach out to friend and 
former foe alike including meetings defeated rival michael dukakis 
democrat jesse jackson and the coretta scott king the widow of 
slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
during his campaign bush said he hoped to have a summit with 
gorbachev as soon as possible after he takes office 
however on friday answering questions after announcing his 
selection of former sen john tower as defense secretary bush said 
there is no expectation that we will or wont have such an early 
session saying he didnt want to send the wrong signal and appear 
over hasty 
a few days earlier bush said he plans to move slowly in arms 
talks with the soviets and said there is no way his 
administration would have a detailed program on arms talks by a 
scheduled feb 5 date for the resumption of talks 
it will be a different kind of white house its going to be 
brimming with kids a very uplifting kind of family setting in 
terms of style i think george bush is going to be closer to john 
kennedy than ronald reagan said iowa rep jim leach a moderate 
republican 
hes going to be very handson and involved capitol hill has 
been increasingly frustrated in dealing with a disengaged president 
i think the bush administration will have a very positive 
attitude leach continued 
but norman ornstein a political analyst for the conservative 
american enterprise institute said bush is trying to balance and 
juggle in the transition as he did in the campaign two very 
different personalities 
one is the tough hardnosed read my lips make my day 
george bush thats the george bush who basically says weve got to 
take it easy with the soviets were not going to rush to judgement 
on a strategic arms limitation treaty with the soviets ornstein 
said 
the other is the kinder and gentler thousand points of light 
to reach out to congress to jesse jackson to various groups george 
bush the one who writes who writes little notes to everybody 
hes managed to juggle the two personalities very adroitly but 
im not sure its going to be as easy to do once hes inaugurated 
ornstein added 
after vowing repeatedly to make his vice president a drug czar in 
his administration bush in recent days has suggested he wont 
saying to do so would circumvent a law passed by congress that 
requires him to name someone other than the vice president to such a 
post 
on the subject of one of reagans pet projects the star wars 
strategic defense initiative bush has reiterated his support for 
the program to shield the nation against incoming nuclear missiles 
but just as in the campaign there was still some ambivalence to 
the vice presidents commitment to the plan heightened by comments 
by tower on friday suggesting sdis usefulness as a bargaining 
lever in dealing with the soviets 
bush has voiced support for the reagan administration decision to 
open talks with plo chief yasser arafat a decision that spares him 
from having to make the tough call but means the talks will proceed 
on his watch 
at the same time he has indicated skepticism and caution 
telling reporters i honestly dont know where it will lead 
i wouldnt overstate the importance of this in terms of the 
formulation of our own middle east policy bush said last week 
but asked whether he would pursue a campaign demand that the plo 
change its covenant to eliminate language supporting the destruction 
of israel bush indicated he would not i dont want to set the 
clock back he said 
on other issues bush continues to decline to spell out where he 
would make cuts to trim the federal budget deficit brushing aside 
specific questions on what he would do for the homeless and how he 
would pay for refurbishing antiquated nuclear weapons plants 
on farm programs bush declared i dont believe we are going to 
balance the budget eventually on the backs of the farmers but 
went on to say he favored allowing more market forces that lead to 
lower supports and lower subsidies 
on trade issues bush indicated that he would continue recent 
reagan administration policy of firing rifle shot trade 
sanctions at economic allies that discriminate against us goods to 
show our determination to have fair trade and equal access

thousands of buzzards have come back 
to winter in south florida but some people complain that the ugly 
birds with a wingspan of up to 6 feet have returned in unprecedented 
numbers 
we joke and say the birds are coming the birds are coming 
said george gerber a resident of the township condominium 
complex 
but he says the birds are no longer a joke because they have come 
in such numbers they dine at dumps soar over parks congregate at 
highrises and even visit some of the mansions in tony palm beach 
when they fly they look like something out of hitchcock 
said doris howard another township resident 
theyre taking over said mildred nierenberg president of 
the townships applewood village i condominium association its 
frightening she said despite reassurances that vultures are 
considered harmless they are known to eat only garbage and the 
flesh of dead creatures 
the condos proximity to a landfill near pompano beach may be its 
attraction 
we can hear them bouncing around on the roof at night said 
fay sackman who lives on the top floor of a township building 
sometimes they go at each other thats making love i guess 
we love mother nature but this is too much said phil 
pincus another township resident 
they sit and preen their feathers said jim roth a spokesman 
for the state solid waste authority which operates the landfill 
near riviera beach there are hundreds of them here they hang out 
and pick through the garbage 
shooting the birds is out because the destruction of wildlife and 
migratory birds is against federal and state laws 
pincus built a fashionable scarecrow on the lawn near his 
building 
i built a scarecrow in christian dior clothes said the 
retired dior distribution manager 
the creation worked on some of the buzzards but pincus says when 
a maintenance worker knocked it down by accident the birds attacked 
and tore it apart 
i guess they thought it had died pincus said this time 
im going to build one and dress it in levis 
but ron broman president of the broward audubon society notes 
the winter residents play a vital environmental role as masters of 
recycling

every morning when people return to 
the streets of this town after a dusktodawn curfew the talk is of 
bodies how many were found whether the victims names are known 
how they died 
like the rest of the population of this tropical island once 
known as an ideal of democracy tangalles residents are to vote 
monday for a new president although voting is only hours away they 
speak not of ballots but of bullets charred bodies and people who 
disappear in the night 
have you seen the body at katuwana village asked gamini 
dissanayake it is almost burnt beyond recognition 
bodies of young sinhalese men have been found almost every day 
for the last two weeks according to the people of tangalle and 
other towns along the south coast 
anula gamage a 26yearold mother of three in tangalle often 
slips out of her house at night to see whether more bodies have been 
dumped by the roadside and whether her husband is among the 
victims she said he was taken away on nov 12 by armed men in 
civilian clothing 
villagers blame government troops for the killings they accuse 
the troops of rounding up people suspected of belonging to the 
peoples liberation front a sinhalese radical group that has vowed 
to disrupt the elections and kill anyone who supports a government 
peace plan for ending a 5yearold insurrection by members of the 
tamil minority 
military officials deny the allegations they say the killings 
are spontaneous civilian retaliations against the front which the 
government blames for the deaths of more than 600 people since the 
peace accord was signed july 29 1987 
the front has accused president junius r jayewardene of selling 
out his own sinhalese community which comprises 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people in attempts to make peace with the 
tamils who account for 18 percent of the population 
jayewardene barred by the constitution from seeking a third 
term has fielded his prime minister ransinghe premedasa to 
represent his united national party 
extremists have killed members of the incumbent party as well as 
supporters of the other two major candidates former prime minister 
sirimavo bandaranaike of the sri lanka freedom party and ossie 
abeygoonesekera of the united socialist alliance on friday a bomb 
went off at bandaranaikes final campaign rally injuring three 
people 
no one knows for sure how many people have disappeared or been 
killed for their suspected links with the peoples liberation front 
but conversations with villagers indicate scores have died 
military officials in colombo said friday that the bodies of 
eight suspected front members had been found in the last 24 hours in 
the sinhalese heartland they blamed the killings on the peoples 
revolutionary red army a group unheard of a few weeks ago 
there were 62 bodies in southern province in the last three 
days said mahinda rajapakse a lawyer in tangalle 90 miles 
southeast of colombo some of them were burned with tires to 
prevent identification 
rajapakses home is a magnet for those whose sons and husbands 
have vanished he said he does not know how many are missing but 
said they number in the hundreds maybe thousands 
the men came in vehicles without license plates and took away 
my son amirth nandasena his mother wailed sitting on the ground 
in her mud hut in tangalle she said amirth was found later shot to 
death his body dumped along the road a mile from her hut 
brig lakshman algama military coordination officer for southern 
province which includes tangalle denied security forces were 
responsible for the charred bodies 
this is a new trend of revenge killings by relatives and 
friends who were earlier killed or harassed by the extremists he 
said in an interview in galle 40 miles west of tangalle 
an emergency government decree nov 9 gave the army the power to 
shoot on sight anyone demonstrating against the government or 
instigating strikes security forces subsequently were empowered to 
bury bodies without waiting for inquests 
government forces acknowledge they round up suspected radicals 
algama said 1235 sinhalese men were detained at boosa prison near 
galle 
they have been apprehended in various police areas in the south 
and are sent here to go through a process of being screened and 
then the innocents are released algama said 
he claimed the security forces actions would allow the country 
to choose a new president 
we have created a climate for elections to be held he said

premier andreas papandreou whose socialist 
administration has been rocked by a financial scandal said saturday 
the government will resign if parliament does not approve his 1989 
budget 
the 69yearold premier told a nationwide television audience 
that he would consider a rejection of the nearly 28 billion budget 
a noconfidence vote in his socialist government 
if not approved the government will resign with all the 
consequences that would follow such an action he said if the 
government resigns because of failure to win a majority in the vote 
scheduled for sunday general elections must be held within 45 days 
papandreous speech came as rumors circulated through the greek 
capital that the government was about to collapse because of a 
widening financial scandal 
the scandal broke in october when opposition parties charged 
senior government officials of involvement in illegal deals 
allegedly set up by banker george koskotas who is accused of 
influence peddling embezzlement and fraud 
the deals allegedly involved directly or indirectly the prime 
minister and members of the governing panhellenic socialist 
movement including papandreous son george who is minister of 
education 
seven ministers have left the 59member cabinet as a result of 
the 300 million banking and arms scandal koskotas the former 
chairman of the bank of crete fled greece nov 6 and has been 
arrested in the united states 
koskotas who ran a housepainting business in new york from 1974 
to 1979 is also charged with attempting to defraud the us 
internal revenue service a hearing is scheduled in us district 
court in manhattan on jan 9 
on wednesday deputy defense minister stathis yiotas resigned 
saying i refuse as a member of this government to be associated 
with adventurers swindlers and embezzlers of public money 
yiotas charged the directors of the greek arms industry of paying 
commissions of millions of dollars for unfulfilled contracts to arms 
dealers hiding behind dummy companies 
he also resigned his seat in parliament and left the governing 
partys central committee 
the scandal widened when a banking commissioner investigating the 
bank of crete said public service organizations had more than 133 
million on deposit with the bank 
 
greek newspapers and opposition political parties accused 
officials working for the post office telephone company and other 
public services of receiving interest rates above the legal limit 
from the bank and pocketing the difference 
 
in his speech papandreou charged domestic and foreign 
circles of undermining and orchestrating the overthrow of his 
socialist administration basing their hopes in god that i would 
not return from london he did not elaborate papandreou underwent 
bypass cardiac surgery there on september 30 
political observers said papandreous speech appeared to be a 
warning to his deputies to adhere to the party line or if they 
failed to approve the governments budget be considered defectors 
according to parliamentary procedure lawmakers cast ballots by 
voice vote and therefore are hesitant to oppose party policy 
his party controls 157 seats in the 300member singlechamber 
parliament the conservative new democracy party has 112 seats the 
communist party 12 and other parties 19 
debate on the budget began thursday and a vote is scheduled for

local governments in china faced with growing 
peasant resistance to the onechild policy are trying to soften the 
blow to families whose one child turns out to be a girl 
a county in southeastern chinas jiangxi province has set up an 
oldage insurance program for couples that have a girl and then 
agree to be sterilized the official peoples daily said friday 
another county in guangdong province has set up a similar program 
with the local government and parents of girls jointly contributing 
to a pension fund the paper said monday 
china seeking to control a population that already exceeds 108 
billion has mandated that most families can have only one child 
but peasant families want boys to help in the fields and support 
them in their old age for centuries girls have been regarded as a 
burden because once they become old enough to make money they marry 
into another family 
as chinas economic reforms have made peasants wealthier more 
and more are willing to pay fines and have a second or third child 
if the first ones turn out to be girls china also has acknowledged 
a growing problem of girl babies being aborted killed at birth or 
abandoned creating a sex ratio imbalance 
the peoples daily said the new oldage insurance plans are 
designed to overcome the disadvantages of having a girl 
in the jiangxi case local governments and industries have 
donated to a fund that will be invested and parents of girls who 
are sterilized can receive payments after they reach age 55 
in guangdong families can draw on the pension fund after 25 
years 
women are under strong pressure from their husbands and inlaws 
to have sons the official china daily recently reported the case of 
a young woman in beijing whose inlaws threw her out of the house 
because she had a girl 
a survey of nearly 300 rural families in central chinas henan 
province found that more girls than boys were born from 1977 to 
1984 but that since 1984 the number of surviving boys babies has 
been nearly twice the number of girls an official report on the 
survey said the mortality rate for baby girls was higher among the 
surveyed families than that for boys 
in one effort to cope with the problem chinas family planning 
officials said in august they were beginning to allow peasant 
families whose first child was a girl to have a second one 
however local family planning officials remain under pressure 
from beijing to meet birth control quotas the pension plans appear 
to be another approach to the problem

a judge citing a rarely used rule disqualified 
himself from a murder case only minutes before he was expected to 
issue a 50year sentence 
as a result of cook county circuit judge philip careys action 
attorneys said friday the case against defendant lorraine williams 
must start over and she may have to face trial and even a possible 
death sentence 
ms williams 27 is charged with the stabbing and beating death 
of the night manager of a suburban motel where she worked as a maid 
carey had indicated at a pretrial hearing with attorneys for 
both sides that he would sentence ms williams to 50 years in prison 
in exchange for a guilty plea assistant states attorney james m 
reilly said 
reilly said that during the course of the plea thursday carey 
believed he heard some additional information about the crime and 
felt it might merit a stiffer sentence 
judge carey recused himself and the case was reassigned 
to another judge the prosecutor said recuse is a legal term 
meaning to withdraw because a judge or juror is prejudiced or 
otherwise incompetent to act 
its very unusual for this to happen but the rules provide 
that this is how its done said defense attorney marvin leavitt 
under the agreement reached at the pretrial conference leavitt 
said his client escaped a trial and a possible death penalty had 
she been convicted 
in disqualifying himself however carey also vacated ms 
williams guilty plea so the case essentially will start from 
scratch leavitt said 
both attorneys said they thought the details described in court 
thursday were virtually the same as those told to the judge 
previously 
carey declined to specify what made him change his mind 
leavitt said he is not bitter even though the judges action 
means his client could now face a trial 
hes a conscientious and thoughtful kind of a judge and felt 
he had no choice but to disqualify himself leavitt said he 
followed the rules if hes secondguessing himself on what he was 
going to do 
ms williams is charged with murder armed robbery and arson in 
the feb 15 death of jane youngjohns 61 ms williams is accused of 
using a rock knife and a heavy metal dustpan to kill ms 
youngjohns in her motel office prosecutors say she then set the 
body on fire 
a jan 4 hearing is scheduled but leavitt said he hopes an 
agreement can be reached with the new judge that will enable his 
client to avoid a trial

tanks and soldiers that could be used 
for earthquake relief instead patrol armenias capital evidence 
that the kremlin believes a show of force is still needed to keep a 
lid on nationalistic unrest 
already dozens of armenian activists have been jailed for 
alleged curfew violations other activists say however that the 
real reason for the arrest has been their continued political 
agitation 
it was the activists heated campaign for armenias annexation of 
the nagornokarabakh district in neighboring azerbaijan that drew 
world attention to armenia for most of the year 
but the dec 7 earthquake that killed an estimated 55000 people 
in northwestern armenia became the focus of the republics 34 
million people 
the activists did not give up however and despite the 
governments avowed policy of glasnost or openness it has 
launched a crackdown against them 
three days after the quake while soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev was visiting armenia to check on disaster relief five 
leaders of the karabakh committee an activist group were arrested 
another leader was arrested later and the other five are now 
reported in hiding 
the unsanctioned group has spearheaded the annexation campaign 
which has led to bloodshed between armenians and azerbaijanis the 
kremlin has refused to turn nagornokarabakh over to armenia 
during a visit to yerevan gorbachev blasted committee members as 
provocateurs trying to take advantage of the instability created 
by the earthquake 
they must be stopped he said 
the armenian communist party newspaper kommunist accused the 
militants of harming earthquake relief efforts 
from a snug headquarters the committee contacts hospitals with 
incompetent instructions disseminates wild rumors and sends 
spurious data to the republics health ministry thus hampering the 
effort to organize effective medical aid to quake victims 
kommunist charged according to a summary of the article carried 
saturday by tass 
some armenians agree with some of the official criticism larisa 
gishiyan 36 said the nagornokarabakh issue must remain a priority 
but that it shouldnt be brought up during mourning 
but the activists believe the karabakh issue must not be put 
aside for anything 
if a person dies in your home you still must eat breathe 
said ruzan gorgisyan whose husband mofses an armenian nationalist 
was arrested nov 27 and sentenced to 30 days in jail 
a politburo commission overseeing earthquake relief said saturday 
that karbakh committee members were making instigatory talks and 
handing out leaflets calling for demonstrations and strikes tass 
said 
the activists anger is increasingly directed at gorbachev they 
say he was heckled and sworn at during his visit to the disaster 
area because of his handling of the karabakh issue but those 
reports could not be independently confirmed 
mrs gorgisyan and martin martirosyan of the armenian group 
alliance for national selfdetermination have even claimed the 
destruction in armenia was caused not by an earthquake but by some 
governmentrun operation to punish the armenian people 
he gorbachev used a national tragedy for his goals 
martirosyan said

a hacker who browsed for weeks through 
the unclassified computer system of a top federal nuclear weapons 
laboratory has been identified and has apologized to authorities 
no arrests have been made officials said saturday fbi and lab 
officials refused to identify the hacker 
in a communication he regretted the difficulty caused by his 
actions and agreed to stop accessing llnl computers said jeff 
garberson spokesman at the lawrence livermore national laboratory 
lab officials had pleaded through local media for the hacker to 
contact them the pleas led to several phone calls identifying 
possible suspects but it was unclear if the identity of the hacker 
was discovered through a tip 
a spokesman said earlier in the week that the hacker did not 
invade the labs top secret nuclear weapons research computers 
which are physically and electronically separated from the 
unclassified system 
the lab run by the university of california at berkeley is one 
of the nations two centers for design manufacture and testing of 
nuclear weapons the other is at los alamos nm 
the fbi is investigating the case spokesman john holford said 
garberson said because criminal charges may be filed lab 
officials will not provide any further information 
the hacker first appeared on the labs internet system about two 
weeks ago the system connects research facilities and universities 
nationwide 
the hacker accessed various computers at the lab and even gave 
himself super user status so he could roam through files 
however no data or files were destroyed 
lab officials described him as joy riding through the system 
to see what he could get into he made at least 11 system 
trespasses the last on dec 10 
the infiltration is on the same system that was invaded by a 
computer virus that struck nationwide last month and by another 
hacker two weeks ago both of the latest invasions were through 
different holes in the system and there may yet be other access 
points that have not been patched

the united states informed the palestine 
liberation organization that if it engages in terrorism the newly 
opened us talks would be discontinued a top state department 
official said saturday 
there is no way this dialogue can be sustained if terrorism is 
persistent and traceable to known elements of the plo assistant 
secretary of state richard w murphy said 
murphy in an interview with the associated press said robert h 
pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia made the point 
strenuously to a plo delegation in their talk friday in carthage an 
ancient city on the outskirts of tunis 
plo chairman yasser arafat at a brief news conference at plo 
headquarters in tunis tunisia said saturday that the plo would 
do all our best to stop terrorism but said he could not 
guarantee that one person here or individual there might not 
ignore his wishes 
arafat said the plos main priority in the talks is to push for 
an early convening of an international peace conference on the 
middle east the united states has said any resolution of the middle 
east crisis would have to come from direct negotiations between 
israel and its neighbors while israel has refused to include the 
plo in any talks 
arafat described fridays meeting as a step in the right 
direction toward a just and comprehensive settlement 
at the same news conference plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman 
charged that israel was trying to undermine the usplo contacts by 
using deadly force against palestinians 
one potential sticking point in the talks was apparent 
abdulrahman said a settlement must include establishment of an 
independent palestinian state while the united states has said its 
decision to open a dialogue with the plo did not affect us 
opposition to such a state 
fridays session was the first authorized us meeting with the 
plo in at least 13 years no further meetings have been scheduled as 
yet said murphy who said major developments in the final five 
weeks of the reagan administration are unlikely abdulrahman said 
he did not expect a second meeting until after presidentelect bush 
takes office next month 
murphy said terrorism was the lead item on the us agenda 
and took up half of the 75minute meeting with a fourman plo 
delegation 
while the plo did not make a specific promise in response murphy 
said there was the general comment from their side that this 
dialogue is too important to have it messed up 
the plo delegation implied arafat would make a special effort to 
restrict the activities of more radical elements said murphy the 
state departments senior middle east specialist 
some palestinian leaders have denounced arafats statements on 
israel official newspapers in syria also opposed the usplo 
meeting saying real peace should be taken by force while 
president ali khamenei of iran said at a prayer meeting friday in 
tehran that the way to fight zionism is by force and power 
in jerusalem israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said he was 
shocked by the us decision and announced he was preparing a new 
peace initiative 
of course its painful to receive such a blow especially from 
friends shamir said on israel radio but lets not exaggerate 
we have had differences of opinion with our friends shamir has 
offered to hold direct peace talks with jordan while excluding the 
plo 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger had promised israel 
in 1975 the united states would shun the plo if it did not accept 
the legitimacy of the jewish state the promise helped induce israel 
to relinquish land in the sinai desert to egypt 
murphy said the plo delegation made the point to pelletreau that 
not everybody is under plo control and can be deterred from 
terrorism that obviously is not going to be a sustainable 
position should there be a rash of incidents which we would term 
terrorism murphy said 
arafat on wednesday renounced terrorism in all forms the 
statement was one of three conditions set by the united states for 
opening talks with the plo 
the two other conditions were explicit acceptance of israels 
right to exist and approval of 1967 and 1973 resolutions of the un 
security council affirming all middle eastern countries should be 
able to live in peace within secure boundaries 
a little more than two weeks earlier secretary of state george 
p shultz had condemned the plo as a terrorist organization called 
arafat an accessory to terrorism and denied the plo chairman 
permission to speak before the united nations in new york 
as a result the un general assembly shifted its debate on the 
arabisraeli dispute to geneva 
murphy said shultzs decision authorizing substantive 
dialogue with the plo had not changed shultzs view of the plo or 
his opposition to establishment of a palestinian state 
in fact the us official said nothing that happened 
wednesday has changed our position or approach to the peace 
process 
these include the view that an independent palestinian state on 
the west bank and gaza which are now held by israel would not be 
viable and that the plo should not have a separate seat in any 
mideast peace talks 
we havent pulled back from any of the shultz initiative 
murphy said 
he referred to the plan for arabisraeli negotiations shultz took 
to the middle east earlier this year it was not accepted by israel 
and jordan while palestinian arabs invited to meet with him in 
jerusalem did not show up 
key features of the us proposal included a joint delegation of 
jordanians and palestinians to negotiate with israel and having 
israel give up some but not all of the land it won in the 1967 
middle east war 
murphy said pelletreaus meeting with plo officials didnt 
answer any of the tough problems but with a us dialogue 
established it will be easier for the united states and the plo to 
understand each others positions 
in the past murphy said saudi arabia and egypt had informed the 
plo of where the united states stood cutting out the third party 
in a conversation should make it clearer he said 
the decision to open the dialogue meanwhile won praise from 
west virginia sen robert c byrd the outgoing senate majority 
leader 
byrd in the democratic partys weekly radio address said the 
plos meeting of the us conditions was long overdue and said 
progress would depend on arafats success in controlling those 
factions within the plo who believe that terrorism is a legitimate 
recourse 
byrd called on israel to support the dialogue as an opportunity 
to be seized an opportunity to develop a new national consensus 
regarding negotiations with the plo

prince norodom sihanouk the cambodian rebel leader 
said saturday that prime minister hun sen must accept a fivepoint 
peace plan before negotiations can continue 
its take it or leave it sihanouk told a meeting of his 
followers who make up one of three rebel groups fighting the 
cambodian government 
sihanouk who has met hun sen three times in france the first 
in december 1987 and the latest last month called the prime 
minister a collaborator and a traitor and the valet of the 
vietnamese who sells off his country to the foriegners 
hun sens communist government was installed by the vietnamese 
after they invaded cambodia in 1978 ending the fouryear reign of 
terror by the chinesebacked khmer rouge 
the fivepoint peace plan was outlined in july when the leaders 
of the four cambodian factions met in jakarta indonesia the fourth 
group is the noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front 
led by former prime minister son sann 
the points of the plan are 
a precise timetable for the withdrawal of vietnamese troops from 
cambodia hun sen claims vietnam has 50000 troops in cambodia but 
western experts put the figure at more than 100000 
the dismantling of hun sens regime 
general elections under the control of an international 
commission 
formation of a new government and army that would include 
supporters of the four sides 
a un peacekeeping force based in cambodia 
sihanouk said saturday he would run for president when the 
elections are held 
the prince speaking in french said his meeting with hun sen 
last month was a total 500 percent failure 
sihanouk last week also met khieu samphan the leader of the 
khmer rouge in the village of fereentardenois northeast of 
paris after the meeting khieu samphan told reporters his group 
considered sihanouk the national leader of cambodia and he 
endorsed the fivepoint plan 
they are not sincere but theyre intelligent sihanouk said 
saturday of the khmer rouge although they were murderers he 
added they could not be ignored in planning cambodias future 
the communist khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians when they ruled the country in 197578 
the 40000member khmer rouge is the strongest of the three rebel 
groups followed by sihanouks force which the prince said saturday 
has 20000 soldiers and is growing 
if the khmer rouge is excluded from a new cambodian government 
sihanouk added they would become bandits outlaws terrorists 
and every time we built a bridge theyd destroy it 
he said any future agreement among the cambodian factions must 
include guarantees that human rights will be respected 
the cambodian government insists it must have a guarantee that 
outside aid to the guerrilla forces especially the chinesesupplied 
khmer rouge must cease before the vietnamese withdrawal 
hun sen also has said the elections should be held under the 
present government while sihanouk insists on the resignation of the 
governmnet before the vote hun sen also told reporters friday that 
he opposes an international peacekeeping force

a newspaper editor who was deported from 
lesotho for publishing articles about alleged government corruption 
arrived in kenya on saturday night and was allowed to stay in the 
country temporarily 
the editor south africanborn johnny maseko was detained for 
six weeks in lesotho before being deported by security police 
earlier today 
police allowed a few relatives and friends of the 29yearold 
editor of the mirror to see his plane off at the airport in maseru 
the capital of lesotho a mountainous kingdom surrounded by south 
africa 
we have allowed him to stay in the country temporarily until 
he can find some place to go an immigration officer in nairobi 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
maseko said in a telephone interview from the airport in nairobi 
that he wants to go to south africa to join his father he said he 
was born in the indian ocean port of durban and i have many 
relatives there 
maseko claims he is a lesotho citizen through his parents were 
working across the border when he was born he fled south africa in 
1980 after becoming involved in antiapartheid organizations 
police in lesotho said maseko is a south african refugee 
under an agreement with the un high commissioner of refugees 
the lesotho government does not send south african refugees back to 
their homeland or allow them to remain in lesotho they are sent to 
a third country 
the mirror which began publishing in mid1988 is an independent 
weekly 
lesotho is ruled by a sixman military council in association 
with king moshoeshoe ii which took power in a january 1986 coup 
after ousting a leftwing dictator chief leabua jonathan 
all political activity is banned in lesotho 
masekos troubles began in november after he published articles 
stating that minister of finance evaristus sekhonyana who held the 
same portfolio in the jonathan government had authorized the 
transfer of millions of rands to the swiss bank account of an 
italian construction company banco which had failed to finish a 
building project in 1981 the directors of the company had fled 
lesotho and the government liquidated the company 
maseko was detained under the internal security act which allows 
temporary detention of people considered a threat to lesothos 
national security when he appealed to the supreme court for release 
on the ground that he posed no such threat he was charged with 
criminally defaming the finance minister 
when that charge was dropped the head of the military council 
maj gen metsing lekhanya authorized an extension of his detention 
maseko claimed that the secretary to the military council tom 
thebane visited him and warned him about writing articles about 
government officials 
the paper has continued to be published by local journalists but 
its articles are widely regarded as less controversial

a thriller about the kidnapping of the 
presidentelect which also features a vicepresident from a 
midwestern state has gone into a second printing since its release 
two months ago 
the novels author says it illustrates how the constitution and 
federal laws are unclear and contradictory about what would happen 
if a presidentelect were kidnapped between election day and when 
the electoral college votes in real life the electoral college 
meets monday 
in oath of office a popular crimebusting us senator from 
california defeats a oneterm president but is kidnapped while 
watching election returns the country is plunged into a 
constitutional crisis 
author steven j kirsch a lawyer said his first novel poses the 
question of what would happen if the presidentelect were kidnapped 
would the vice presidentelect be inaugurated instead 
though the book doesnt mention presidentelect george bush or 
vice presidentelect dan quayle the fictional vice presidentelect 
in kirschs book which he sold in 1986 is a young senator from a 
midwestern state selected to give the ticket geographical balance 
the electors would be going through the same mental gymnastics 
if bush were kidnapped kirsch said what happens in real life 
would be what i described in my book 
the 20th amendment provides for the vice presidentelect to 
become president if the presidentelect dies before he can be sworn 
in 
but what if the presidentelect were kidnapped would the 
electors qualify the presidentelect as president even though hes 
missing would the vice presidentelect be named president or would 
the decision be thrown into the us house 
everyone has agreed there is no precedent for this kirsch 
said there is no clearcut answer and if it happens the country 
would be in a worse crisis than watergate 
in kirschs 355page book jonathan starr defeats arthur 
sutherland to become the nations first jewish presidentelect 
but on election night starr is kidnapped from his san francisco 
hotel room by henchmen of tommy duncan a corrupt labor leader 
the country is plunged into a constitutional crisis sutherland 
who is negotiating a secret middle east peace plan considers 
whether he should have himself declared the winner charles durkin 
the powerhungry speaker of the house plots to steal the election 
and the secret service the fbi and the press scramble to find starr 
the politics would be brutal kirsch said our allies 
wouldnt know what would happen it would be so unsettling to the 
stock market and people would be very worried 
charles walcott an associate professor of political science at 
the university of minnesota agrees that the constitution is 
ambiguous about what would happen if the presidentelect were 
kidnapped 
its not anticipated in the constitution and its not clearly 
covered he said 
however walcott said he doesnt believe a constitutional crisis 
would result if it should happen a way would be found to cover 
it he said probably the courts would not have trouble advising 
what to do 
kirsch 37 said he began thinking about writing a book about a 
jewish president while a college student in the mid1970s he said 
he found himself wondering how a jewish president would deal with 
the middle east 
he also was intrigued by what would happen if the presidentelect 
were kidnapped he thought about a 1933 assassination attempt on 
presidentelect franklin d roosevelt in which chicago mayor anton 
cermak was killed 
i thought thats it ill merge the two stories kirsch 
said 
kirsch began writing the book in 1980 five years later he 
hooked up with an agent henry morrison who also represents 
espionagethriller writer robert ludlum and rambo creator david 
morrell 
after the book was rejected by 10 publishers the paperback 
division of random house inc bought the manuscript in 1986 the 
publisher kirsch said decided to hold off issuing the book until 
1988 to capitalize on the presidential election 
fawcettcrest published oath of office in october more than 
100000 copies of the book have been printed according to 
fawcettcrest spokeswoman beverly robinson

economic policies that shut down nearly all business and labor 
activity 
government spokeswoman rosa conde told reporters no resignations 
of any ministers were planned due to wednesdays strike by the two 
major leftist unions she reiterated the socialist administrations 
willingness to open wideranging talks with the two major leftist 
unions that organized it and top business leaders 
but the socialistled general workers union and the 
communistdominated workers commissions again rejected socialist 
prime minister felipe gonzalezs offer to take part in talks with 
the government and the head of the nations key business 
organization 
the socialists hold a comfortable majority in parliament and do 
not have to call elections until june 1990 
the general strike was the first in 54 years the unions want 
unemployment insurance coverage broadened to include up to 48 
percent of spains 27 million jobless and the smallest retirement 
pensions increased to the legal monthly minimum wage of 394 
ms conde said a government representative perhaps gonzalez 
would explain the administrations view of the strike and the 
demands of the unions before parliament wednesday

it as a political success and a tough political blow to the 
government he repeated his offer to discuss demands with unions

on friday leaders of the socialistled general workers union and 
the communistdominated workers commissions appeared at a large 
peaceful demonstration in central madrid and rejected the meeting 
offered by gonzalez if he insists the head of the nations key 
business organization attend 
at least 40000 people attended the rally 
despite an economic growth rate of 5 percent annually that puts 
it at the top of western european economies 187 percent of the 
people are unemployed europes highest rate union leaders and 
members have argued the time has come to share more of the spoils of 
economic boom with workers and the poor

the us navy is further scaling back 
operations in the persian gulf and will reduce its forces from 15 to 
14 ships early next month us military sources said saturday 
in the latest change of procedure us warships will use radar 
to monitor usflagged vessels in the waterway said sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the move means the warships may no 
longer be within quick reach in emergencies 
one source said the change like some earlier ones reflects a 
pentagon judgment that the threat to shipping in the gulf has 
decreased since the ceasefire in the war between iran and iraq went 
into effect aug 20 
at least 1 million people have been killed or wounded in the war 
which followed border skirmishes and an iraqi invasion in september 
1980 the fighting spilled over into the gulf with attacks on 
foreign ships 
there have been no armed incidents reported in the gulf since the 
truce and the united states has already reduced its forces in the 
region by two ships other foreign navies are also reducing 
operations or pulling out 
however us defense secretary frank c carlucci said during a 
visit to the region dec 5 that washington had made no plans for 
major changes in forces because unsponsored peace talks between 
iran and iraq are stalled 
senior us officials have talked recently of an eventual force 
of about 10 us ships in the gulf 
the cut in force strength results from cancellation of orders 
last week for a missile frigate uss klakring to leave for the gulf 
from charleston sc 
three others the destroyer uss obannon and the missile frigates 
uss hawes and uss de wert sailed for the gulf as planned however 
and on arrival in january will replace ships completing threemonth 
duty tours in the waterway 
the four leaving are the missile cruiser uss josephus daniels and 
the missile frigates uss aubrey fitch uss doyle and uss taylor

from the threeparty democratic front which includes former

thousands of troops refused to move the talks beyond prisoner

call a soviet escalation of combat failed 
we showed our concern that we thought they were not serious 
about peace he said

the southern city of kandahar in recent days afghanistans 
secondlargest city kandahar has been under guerrilla seige for 
several months 
there has been no independent confirmation of a renewed soviet 
presence there

rahim said the fourmember soviet delegation wanted proof of the 
identity of the four red army prisoners

soviets the four prisoners because of the war situation 
he accused the soviets of stalling the exchange he said the 
guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic warriors are ready to 
hand the four prisoners over for 100 guerrillas 
they are delaying not us said rahim 
the onehour meeting in islamabad on saturday ended without any 
agreement he said

mayor w wilson goode has cut off funds to a 
gangcontrol organization once considered a model program for 
reducing street tension forcing a halt to its programs 
goode said friday that the crisis intervention networks 
financial problems including a 203000 debt to the internal 
revenue service were insurmountable 
we will not use city funds to pay off an old debt he said 
the mayor said he hoped the private nonprofit agencys program 
and employees could be absorbed by another agency so that its work 
could continue but he said no alternatives have been explored 
the groups executive director bennie j swans said 38 of the 
48 employees were laid off friday and its programs were shut down 
he said he and the other nine employees would stay until jan 5 
when city funding ends to tie up loose ends and try to find another 
source of funds 
everyone agrees weve performed a valuable service swans 
said i think that the services are sorely needed in the community 
and i think people are going to suffer because of it 
the decision to close the agency came after months of uncertainty 
over its future sparked by complaints of financial mismanagement 
the crisis intervention network was founded in 1975 as an arm of 
city government 
its approach to gang warfare using streetsavvy workers many 
of them former gang members to mediate disputes and reduce 
community tension won praise and became a model for programs 
around the country 
the network became a private nonprofit agency in 1979 but the 
city has remained its principal source of funds with city contracts 
paying 15 million or more in each of the past three years 
but three months ago a group of current and former employees 
wrote to elected officials and news media accusing swans of spending 
abuses and mismanagement 
swans called the allegations groundless but acknowledged 
bookkeeping problems including a failure to send to the irs about 
80000 withheld from employee paychecks 
the irs filed a 203000 lien against the network dec 9 said 
david kairys cochairman of the agencys board he said the board 
had not decided whether its over whether to reorganize 
bankruptcy we have choices 
i think the city has gotten used to cin stepping in when things 
get hot kairys said we are the envy of cities around the 
country it just seems unnecessary and detrimental for the city to 
cut off the funding

the defense minister on saturday 
tried to defuse tensions behind a recent insurrection defending the 
military view of a repressive campaign against leftists that 
convulsed the nation a decade ago 
horacio jaunarena said civilians who applauded a march 1976 
military coup must share some responsibility for the campaign by 
security forces known as the dirty war that killed 9000 
argentines he called the action necessary 
the repression remains a burning political issue and the question 
of whether it was necessary in order to end chaos divides argentina 
which resumed civilian rule in 1985 after the military returned to 
the barracks 
jaunarenas remarks in a speech to newly commissioned officers 
is an apparent attempt to placate military resentment that burst 
forth in a fourday insurrection earlier this month and lingers 
despite the acceptance by the government of a key rebel demand a 
pay increase 
the great part of the 1970s struggle was outside the 
framework of constitutional governments leaving open to question 
the political and legal legitimacy of a battle that was necessary 
jaunarena told the officers at the military college 
the military view is that it fought an unconventional war against 
leftist guerrillas using unconventional means and deserves a better 
role in society the view by human rights groups is that what 
happened amounted to organized murder 
the phenomenon terrorism was eliminated but not the rebuke 
by society he said we should admit that we made a mistake are 
we going to keep trying to put all the blame on one side or are 
we going to accept the reality that is evident to every sensible 
argentine 
he said civilians in 1976 wanted an end to the bombings 
assassinations and kidnappings that had become almost daily 
occurrences and must share the responsibility 
the coups through which we argentines have lived were not the 
exclusive action of the military jaunarena said 
while the army fought guerrilla battles with the peoples 
revolutionary army security forces as a whole have been condemned 
for arresting several thousand argentine citizens alleged 
sympathesizers who disappeared and were presumed executed 
the presence of president raul alfonsin at the military college 
indicated that jaunarena spoke for the government 
it is necessary to bring to an end a period of mutual scorn and 
reciprocal ignorance jaunarena said our society has gone 
through a crisis which should be confronted with the essential key 
of unity 
a day before army chief lt gen jose dante caridi said in a tv 
interview that he agreed with demands made by rebel commander col 
mohamed ali seineldin including the need to reintegrate the armed 
forces into society as valued members 
i say emphatically there was a war against subversion and it 
is absolutely unjust to accuse the armed forces of genocide 
caridi said 
the rebels demanded an end to the prosecution of officers for 
human rights abuses committed during the 197683 dictatorship a 
shakeup of the command structure and a bigger military budget 
alfonsin and leaders of the opposition peronist party have said 
publicly that they oppose any amnesty for officers already convicted 
of human rights abuses or under prosecution on murder and torture 
charges 
in december 1985 a civilian court convicted five former military 
junta members including exmilitary presidents jorge videla and 
roberto viola for human rights abuses

a second defendant charged in the takeover 
of a north carolina newspaper has fled to a new york indian 
reservation saying he is in fear for his life his attorney said 
saturday 
i view him as i would anyone fleeing a third world 
dictatorship ron kuby one of eddie hatchers attorneys said in 
a telephone interview from his new york office he has no 
intention of returning to robeson county unless or until democracy 
is restored there 
he said hatcher had telephoned him to say he was in new york but 
would not specify where

in new york and i intend to stay here i cannot be forced back 
there is no jurisdiction where i am the united states has no 
jurisdiction and the state of new york does not

county nc grand jury on state kidnapping charges less than two 
months after they were acquitted of federal hostagetaking charges 
in the feb 1 takeover of the robesonian newspaper in lumberton a 
trial date has not been set 
hatcher and jacobs contend taking over the newspaper was the only 
way they could draw attention to what they call public corruption in 
robeson county 
hatcher was free on 25000 bond posted by the national council 
of churches with the stipulation that he stay in robeson county and 
appear for his court dates

robeson county officials said saturday they had no information on 
hatchers whereabouts 
we did not have him under surveillance said jimmy maynor 
chief of detectives for the sheriffs department if he has fled 
to avoid prosecution then necessary steps will be taken if he fails 
to appear in court 
onondaga indian chief leon shenandoah reached at his home 
saturday said he did not know where hatcher was and refused further 
comment 
jacobs fled to the new york reservation when the state charges 
were filed and was arrested tuesday after a car chase with state 
police near oneida ny he is scheduled to appear in madison 
county ny court jan 12 on charges stemming from the chase 
he was released friday under 25000 bond also posted by the

statement that they would not harbor him if new york gov mario 
cuomo orders his extradition to north carolina 
gov jim martin has said hell push for jacobs extradition 
kuby said hatcher said he has received recent death threats 
i will not return to north carolina until we have a just system 
of government in north carolina and that means the resignation of

ten days after armenias devastating 
earthquake rescue workers freed a 62yearold woman from a 
collapsed building saturday but officials indicated they will soon 
halt efforts to rescue others 
in another dramatic rescue tale a health official said saturday 
that a woman trapped in her basement helped keep her 3yearold 
alive by pricking her own fingers and letting the child suck her 
blood 
the health of the 30yearold mother who was rescued thursday 
after eight days was improving and her child was in good condition 
said dr ophelia nazaryan head physician at childrens hospital no 
3 in yerevan 
a national politburo commission overseeing relief operations in 
northwestern armenia said the first and most acute stage of rescue 
operations is drawing to an end the official tass news agency 
reported from yerevan armenias capital the highlevel commission 
said preparations were beginning to rebuild housing factories and 
farms in the zone struck by the dec 7 quake 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who heads the commission said 
the focus of the relief effort will soon shift to restoration 
work tass reported 
however in a possible split between moscow and armenian 
officials on relief priorities armenian communist party leader 
suren arutunyan said rescuing people is remaining the main task in 
the stricken areas tass said 
meanwhile leaders of government ministries met saturday in 
yerevan to determine how to rebuild the ravaged area where the 
homes of an estimated 500000 people were ruined 
the official casualty toll in the earthquake that rocked 
northwestern armenia is an estimated 55000 dead with thousands 
injured 
tass said saturday night that a total of 23390 bodies have been 
recovered that would mean about an equal number of victims may 
still lie buried in the ruins 
in the past 24 hours the woman in leninakan was the only 
survivor found by rescue parties combing through debris tass said 
late saturday altogether 89 bodies were also removed from 
collapsed apartment houses and other buildings it said 
worsening weather will bring wet snow and wind to the quake zone 
where tens of thousands are living in tents or in the open air the 
politburo commission said saturday tass said said 9862 people were 
evacuated from the disaster area friday and saturday and more than 
24000 people who lost their homes were living in the region in 
other shelter 
an armenian official told soviet television friday night that 20 
people had been found alive in the ruins of leninakan on thursday 
and one in spitak an armenian city virtually destroyed in the quake 
however a government official overseeing search and rescue 
efforts in leninakan once home to more than 250000 people said it 
was now just as urgent to uncover and bury the dead as it was to 
find more survivors otherwise disease could spread said armenian 
deputy prime minister vardkes artsruny 
in geneva the international committee of the red cross urged a 
temporary halt to planning new flights of worldwide relief shipments 
to the soviet republic to assess where relief was most needed and 
avoid waste 
edgard eeckman a spokesman for the league of red cross and red 
crescent societies said its not that that there are no more 
needs in armenia the message is lets stop for a little while to 
make an evaluation 
the trapped woman in leninakan identified by witnesses only as 
lucy was eased from the rubble after a 20member rescue team from 
czechoslovakia heard her voice from underneath witnesses said 
it took 2 hours to free the grayhaired woman from the wreckage 
of what had been the kitchen of a thirdfloor apartment 
the bodies of four children apparently the womans 
grandchildren were also found in the debris 
the woman who looked alert and gripped the stretcher she was 
placed on was rushed to a hospital chief dr sergei uruman 
marveled that she was still alive after being buried for 10 days 
but said she had suffered extensive injuries to a thigh and was in 
critical condition 
it was a miracle but i doubt she will live said uruman 
near the ruined ninestory building sobbing by a smouldering 
campfire sat the womans daughter who appeared to be in her 40s 
she repeated the names of relatives killed in the same apartment 
where her mother was found 
in another section of the wrecked building rescue workers 
uncovered the bodies of a man woman and child who had died while 
huddled together 
the armenian official whose report was broadcast on soviet 
television friday said the discovery of a survivor in spitak spurred 
officials there to continue looking for survivors for 10 more days 
an estimated 15000 of 25000 people in that city were killed 
artsruny said rescue efforts would continue for a few more days 
in leninakan but no firm deadline to stop had been set 
ryzhkov has said some of the rescue work is going slowly because 
relatives are lying in front of bulldozers to prevent them from 
moving in until their relatives bodies were recovered 
in leninakan artsruny said demolition of buildings left 
partially standing could begin in two days

the worlds most secretive giant threw open its 
borders last week to bare the pain of the armenian earthquake and 
let the world and the soviet people help dig out victims from 
under the rubble 
suddenly soviets were human they were crying in grief 
agonizing over the crumbled concrete hiding their lost loved ones 
bleeding from their wounds 
they had faces unlike the thousands of unidentified soviets 
irradiated and uprooted under cover of a media blackout following 
the chernobyl nuclear power station explosion just two and a half 
years ago 
in opening the region to international relief workers the soviet 
union also gained 100 million in emergency aid the official soviet 
news agency tass said saturday it also saved thousands of lives 
that would have been lost without french search dogs israeli 
doctors and belgian artificial kidney machines 
the united states alone sent 66 million in assistance from both 
government and private sources 
it was the first time since world war ii that international aid 
has poured into the fiercely selfsufficient soviet union and once 
again it cracked the image of evil western capitalists fostered by 
decades of propaganda 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov thanking 
the world for help last week fondly recalled eating spam an 
american canned meat product during world war ii he said he still 
considers it a delicacy 
foreign journalists who normally must wait weeks or months for 
permission to enter the country flew in aboard relief planes and 
were handed monthlong visas at the moscow airport others went 
straight to the stricken area without papers and werent disturbed 
by authorities who ordinarily subject each new arrival to a 
thorough document check 
the government waived its requirement that moscowbased 
correspondents give 48 hours notice and a detailed itinerary before 
they leave the city and it reopened armenia which had been closed 
to foreign journalists since a renewed outbreak of ethnic violence 
in november 
correspondents hitchhiked explored and conducted interviews 
wherever they chose a foreign reporter caught rides with soviet 
troops 
in moscow the foreign ministry which now holds daily press 
briefings but rarely provides news gave regular updates on the 
number of casualties and the state of the relief effort 
in the same nation that covered up the deaths of more than 
100000 people in the ashkhabad quake 40 years ago the soviet press 
pounced on the story this time the tass news agency poured out 
reams of copy and offered foreign agencies wrenching photographs of 
the tragedy starting the day after the quake 
newspapers printed daily interviews with victims rescuers and 
even critics of the disorganization hampering the relief effort 
they printed articles with talk of shoddy construction practices 
that caused concreteslab buildings to collapse and contributed to 
the huge death toll 
only hours before the quake destroyed most of three cities and 
more than 100 rural villages president mikhail s gorbachev told 
the united nations in new york that advances in mass media and 
transportation were making the world more visible and tangible 
today the preservation of any kind of closed society is hardly 
possible said the leader of a nation that has tried for much of 
its history to insulate itself from the outside 
he did not know then that in a few hours he would have the 
opportunity to demonstrate that belief

prime minister yitzhak shamir said saturday he 
was shocked by washingtons decision to open a dialogue with the plo 
and announced he was preparing a new peace initiative to counter the 
us move 
in downtown jerusalem thousands of rightwing israelis and 
jewish settlers demonstrated to protest the new us policy some 
protesters later marched to the us consulate 
we must break terrorism in the field and the state terrorism of 
both the plo and the united states one speaker told protesters 
shamirs comments on israel radio were the first by the 
rightwing leader since washington announced wednesday it had ended 
a ban on talks with the palestine liberation organization 
its not surprising that we were shocked by the us decision 
to talk with the organization which is our most radical enemy he 
said 
shamir said the us move posed a very serious test to 
israels alliance with washington the strongest supporter of the 
jewish state and the donor of 3 billion a year in foreign aid 
in making the decision the united states gave in to external and 
internal pressures shamir said he predicted usplo dialogue will 
fail when plo chief yasser arafat is put to the test of halting 
terrorism 
he reiterated his staunch opposition to any dealings with the plo 
shamir also confirmed earlier reports of his plan to announce a 
new middle east initiative after the formation of israels new 
government he declined to elaborate 
shamirs close ally in the rightwing likud bloc cabinet 
minister moshe arens said on the radio that israels next 
government will discuss a unilateral move to grant palestinians 
limited selfrule as envisioned in the 1978 usmediated camp 
david accord between israel and egypt 
the plo says it will settle only for an independent palestinian 
state egypt views the accord as outdated 
israel radio said two labor cabinet ministers gad yaakobi and 
moshe shahal plan to raise the autonomy issue at the cabinet 
meeting sunday 
the selfrule idea could bridge the gap between likud and the 
leftofcenter labor party led by foreign minister shimon peres 
the two main parties have been locked in complex coalition talks 
since israels nov 1 parliament elections they disagree sharply on 
the issue of peace moves likud opposes conceding land captured in 
1967 while labor favors a territorial compromise in exchange for 
peace 
peres and other labor leaders responding to the recent us 
decision to talk to the plo have proposed elections in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and talks with elected 
palestinian representatives as a substitute for the plo 
shamir may include the idea in his autonomy program palestinian 
notables in the occupied territories however reject moves that 
would exclude the plo 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a labor party member said friday 
the us decision on the plo was a grave mistake both regarding 
terrorism and the possibility of open political talks 
the decision he said actually granted legitimacy to the 
uprising in the territories or the yearlong palestinian revolt in 
the west bank and gaza strip since the uprising broke out dec 8 
329 palestinians and 13 israelis have been killed 
demonstrators in front of the us consulate lit candles and 
waved signs that read the united states gave a medal to the 
killers of our children and usa stay out 
the organizers said they later glued to the consulate door a 
letter addressed to president reagan accusing the united states of 
falling to its knees before the plo

a us coast guard helicopter on saturday 
rescued two pilots who were stranded four days on a remote canadian 
glacier after making an emergency landing in their vintage world war 
iiera airplane 
one of the pilots said they were tired but in good condition 
after living on snacks water and beer in the snowbound plane the 
vintage grumman widgeon amphibious plane was equipped with survival 
gear 
we both lost a little weight but thats about it said 
michael mills 
whiteout conditions had prevented rescuers from getting to the 
pilots during daily attempts that began tuesday 
mills 38 said in a telephone interview from his home that he 
landed the plane after the engines failed he and fellow pilot 
charles buddy ferguson 31 were confident they would be 
rescued he said 
we pretty much knew we were ok we probably could have stayed 
there another week without being in too bad a shape mills said 
the two men had reported by radio earlier that they were unhurt 
and comfortable the coast guard said 
the h3 helicopter hoisted the men from the glacier about 1020 
am ast and they were flown to their hometown of gustavus about 60 
miles south chief petty officer jim van atta said 
the rescue was performed swiftly because of the danger coast 
guard lt rick ehret said the helicopter hovered about 70 feet 
above the ice as the men climbed one at a time into a basket 
it was quite a demanding difficult manuever since snow blows 
up when youre hovering over something like that ehret said it 
creates whiteout conditions it was very difficult for the pilot 
ehret credited mills and ferguson for waiting out the storm and 
advising rescuers to do the same they could tell early on that 
the weather wasnt getting any better he said they had cool 
heads 
it just worked really well said ferguson there werent a 
lot of questions and answers you just do what you know youve got 
to do 
the face of the glacier at tarr inlet is in glacier bay 
national park and preserve and is about 60 miles north of gustavus 
a small southeast alaska port town the huge river of ice stretches 
far into british columbia 
nightly temperatures on the glacier were estimated at 20 to 25 
degrees said robert jacobson a national weather service 
meteorologist in juneau 
the pilots were several miles inside canada coast guard 
officials said they had received permission from the canadian 
government to conduct the rescue 
mills said he and ferguson lived on cheese salami a bag of corn 
chips and two cans of oysters they rationed the food and had still 
some left when they were rescued 
we just nibbled we drank plenty of water we had a case of 
beer and we drank that he said we really werent that hungry 
because we were so inactive 
we did well together we had three magazines that we both read 
about three different times backwards and forwards mills said 
mills said the plane which is being restored was undamaged and 
would be flown off the glacier later this week if the weather 
permits 
were going to have to go up and get it he said itll fly 
right out of there its a great airplane 
mills and ferguson operate alaska seair adventures a 
gustavusbased company that transports anglers hunters 
photographers and tourists to remote spots in southeast alaska 
snowfall and poor visibility prevented the helicopter from 
reaching the plane until the first break in the weather came 
saturday morning officials had kept in radio contact with the men 
by repeatedly flying a c130 transport plane over the glacier 
the coast guard has been great mills said

a moderate lebanese militia on saturday 
surrounded proiranian shiite moslem extremists and forced them to 
free three irish un peacekeeping troops kidnapped a day earlier in 
south lebanon 
also saturday plo chief yasser arafat indicated he was involved 
in the release a day earlier of a swiss red cross official a 
leading shiite cleric said he has given up trying to free 14 other 
foreign hostages because his efforts have reached a dead end 
lebanese police said the mainstream shiite moslem militia amal 
surrounded a house in the village of sultaniyeh and forced about 20 
men inside belonging to the group faithful resistance to surrender 
and free the three irish soldiers of the un interim force in 
lebanon or unifil 
a police spokesman said the militia also conducted a sweep 
rounding up 80 other members of faithful resistance a small fanatic 
affiliate of hezbollah or party of god which is believed to be the 
umbrella organization for proiranian groups holding foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
police sources said the faithful resistance kidnapped the irish 
soldiers friday in retaliation for the israeli detainment of a group 
leader and other guerrillas 
amal summoned the faithful resistances seven commanders 
individually to a meeting to discuss the release of the irish 
soldiers and captured them when they refused to release peacekeepers 
unconditionally their followers gave in a while later said the 
police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations 
the house in sultaniyeh was one mile southwest of tibnin where 
the irishmen were abducted the 620strong irish batallion serving 
with unifil is headquartered in tibnin a village 13 miles north of 
israel which borders israels sixto10mile selfproclaimed 
security zone 
the police spokesman identified the three rescued irish soldiers 
as corp patrick maeken 35 pvt brian kearney 25 and pvt bernak 
mccarugmey 30 
unifil spokesman timur goksel said amal returned the three to 
their command they are in good shape goksel said in a 
telephone interview 
the abductions apparently were intended to retaliate for israels 
seizure thursday of faithful resistance guerrilla commander jawad 
kasfi in tibnin 
the israeli military command said kasfi was linked to attacks on 
israeli army forces and an israelibacked militia the south lebanon 
army since 1984 
red cross worker peter winkler 32 was freed friday night in the 
southern city of sidon where he was abducted nov 17 police said 
winkler boarded a ferry saturday at the christian port of jounieh 
heading for cyprus the swiss foreign ministry earlier said winkler 
was to fly home via cyprus sunday 
arafat indicated saturday he played a role in the release when he 
was in geneva last week to address the united nations 
when i was in geneva the chief of the red cross asked me to 
help release the swiss employee and he has been released arafat 
said without elaborating he spoke shortly after his arrival in 
tunis tunisia where the palestine liberation organization is 
headquartered 
in bern swiss foreign minister rene felber said saturday that 
talks between a swiss official and arafat proved useful 
felber said winklers captors tried to tie his release to a 
lenient sentence for a jailed lebanese plane hijacker hussein 
hariri but switzerland refused any concessions 
he said that in indirect contacts the kidnappers identified 
themselves as members of a dissident palestinian group named 
organization of socialist revolution 
an official of the allswiss international committee of the red 
cross said the humanitarian agency will negotiate safety guarantees 
with various parties and groups in lebanon before resuming full 
activities there 
the delegation cut nearly in half after winkler was kidnapped 
will be brought back to its original size of 30 as soon as possible 
said the official at icrc headquarters in geneva who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
winklers release leaves 14 foreigners including nine americans 
missing and presumed kidnapped by proiranian factions in lebanon 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985

a crew planning to take durable plastic 
tents to earthquake victims in soviet armenia got word saturday that 
a soviet military cargo plane will carry them to the disaster site 
the groups leader said 
the 17member team is scheduled to leave sunday said anthony 
seraphin president of protectaboat and film applicators of north 
america the springfield pa company that came up with the idea 
for the quicktobuild shelters 
as far as we know were ready to go he said but added that 
hell believe it when were on the plane 
there was no immediate word on when the plane would return to the 
soviet union with materials it has picked up in other us cities 
soviet officials estimate 55000 lives were lost and 500000 
people were left homeless by the dec 7 quake after hearing of the 
massive displacement seraphin came up with the idea of using the 
film for tents 
construction techniques require building frames out of steel and 
then shrinkwrapping them with resinbased plastic using a propane 
heat gun seraphin said a tent that can house 30 people takes about 
two hours to build and includes doors windows and vents 
the arrival of the soviet plane would end two days of frustration 
for seraphin and the washington dcbased armenia relief society 
in the past two days i would guesstimate that weve 
contacted close to 100 people from the secretary of state on down to 
business people with contacts seraphin said adding he had talked 
to people in washington new york detroit los angeles maryland 
and florida 
earlier in the week the air national guard offered to fly the 
group if seraphin received permission from the defense department 
on friday the defense department said that the state department 
would have to approve the trip 
everybody wanted to be very helpful but no one seemed able to 
break through seraphin said we just had to break through the 
red tape 
the team intends to go from town to town in the quake area 
building five to 10 shelters and teaching the residents how to build 
more for themselves 
then when we get back well be raising money to send more 
material over there so they can do it themselves said seraphin 
the group had not made plans for their return as of saturday

striking workers at a governmentowned 
uraniumprocessing plant voted overwhelmingly saturday to approve a 
partial contract settlement with the company that operates the 
facility a spokesman said 
the settlement will allow 625 workers who have been on strike 
since oct 7 to return to work monday said plant spokesman pete 
kelley however about 250 of the workers lost their jobs last week 
to layoffs resulting from decreased production demands

atomic trades and labor council approved the agreement by a 3to1 
ratio

cincinnati formally known as the feed materials production center 
has been halted since the strike began the plant owned by the us 
department of energy processes uranium the government uses in 
nuclear weapons 
since the strike the plant has become embroiled in controversy 
following the does admission that radioactive material leaked into 
the environment over a 30year period 
the energy department has pledged itself to a massive cleanup 
and recent reports indicate the department is considering closing 
the facility altogether 
the striking workers met friday and heard details of the proposed 
settlement 
when they struck in october union leaders said the dispute was 
not over wages but over fringe benefits and retirement programs 
they said the company wanted workers to pay more for benefits 
the agreement includes a new health insurance program but no pay 
increase 
under the agreement workers can return to work and pursue up to 
4000 safety and health grievances

plo chief yasser arafat said saturday he 
would do his best to prevent palestinian terrorist attacks but could 
not guarantee that some militants wouldnt step out of line 
palestinian leaders said the plo used its first official meeting 
with the united states friday to assure washington it will pressure 
its followers to refrain from terrorism 
we will do all our best to stop all this terrorism arafat 
told reporters after returning to his headquarters in tunis 
in an apparent reference to some radical palestinian factions 
that oppose his strategies the plo chief said he could not 
guarantee that one person here or one individual there might not 
resort to terrorism 
give me one example of any ruler who can have complete control 
with all the groups he said 
the plo serves as an umbrella organization for eight different 
guerrilla factions which constitute the palestinians military arm 
the main group is arafats fatah but other plo factions backed by 
syria mount operations against israel and its embassies abroad the 
factions sometimes fight each other 
the plo bankrolled by the 21 member states of the arab league 
has representatives in about 100 countries 
plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman added we will use all our 
efforts and all our influence on our people all over the world not 
to involve or engage in any operation against civilians innocent 
people or americans 
arafats renunciation of terrorism and recognition of israels 
right to exist led the us government on wednesday to drop its ban 
on contacts with the palestine liberation organization and to open 
a substantive dialogue with the group 
in another boost for the plo algeria accepted the credentials of 
the first ambassador of the newly declared state of palestine the 
algerian government news agency said in fridays report based on a 
foreign ministry statement the ambassador was identified as moudher 
dadjani 
arafat described fridays 90minute meeting between the us 
ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau jr and a fourmember 
plo delegation as a step in the right direction toward a just 
and comprehensive settlement 
no peace can be settled without their us participation and 
their efforts he said at a brief news conference 
arafat said the plos main priority in the talks is to push for 
an early convening of an international peace conference on the 
middle east us officials say an international conference is no 
substitute for direct arabisraeli talks 
abdulrahman charged israel was trying to undermine the usplo 
contacts by using deadly force against palestinians the israeli 
government is trying to sabotage this dialogue to stop it he 
said 
he said plo officials had raised this issue in the talks friday 
and urged the us government to pressure israel to halt the use of 
deadly force against the yearlong palestinian uprising in the west 
bank and gaza strip in which more than 320 palestinians and 13 
israelis have been killed 
arafat also condemned killings in the occupied territories 
terming them a continuation of state terrorism 
abdelrahman said the plo has tightened security measures in 
recent days for fear of possible attacks by the israeli secret 
services 
he said the next round of talks would be held after 
presidentelect george bush takes office jan 20 
he said that at the next sessions the plo will seek a common 
understanding with the americans on the issue of an international 
conference palestinian statehood and withdrawal of israeli forces 
from the occupied territories 
we will not have results or solutions in one day 
abdulrahman said its not like a knockout in boxing we must go 
pointbypoint 
last month in algeria the plo proclaimed an independent state 
without specifying its borders us officials have said the opening 
of a dialogue with the plo does not represent recognition of the 
state 
the plo spokesman giving a detailed account of fridays talks 
said the americans outlined their attitude toward terrorism and 
emphasized that any plo terrorism would derail the dialogue 
us embassy officials on saturday declined comment on the talks 
saying any further comment would come from the state department in 
washington 
abdulrahman said the palestinian delegates emphasized their 
opposition to individual group and state terrorism 
we will urge all palestinians individuals and all palestinian 
organizations to adopt this strategy for peace he said no one 
has the right to violate this palestinian strategy any mistake from 
our side will deteriorate the whole dialogue with the americans

the foreign ministry on saturday said 
the united states is trying to maintain a military presence in 
panama into the next century in spite of the panama canal treaties 
in washington a state department spokesman said the united 
states intends to abide by the treaties 
the panamanian government statement issued in panama city said 
the foreign ministry has been following the development of a 
unilateral thesis in the us state department under which the 
neutrality treaty would allow a limited us military presence in 
panama past dec 31 1999 
the panama canal treaties signed by president carter and 
panamanian leader omar torrijos in 1977 stipulate that on dec 31 
1999 only the republic of panama will operate the canal and 
maintain military forces defense sites and military installations 
inside national territory 
the panamanian foreign ministry said the us intention to remain 
in panama after 1999 is one of the main reasons for the economic 
aggression and the threatening use of force against panama 
asked about panamas charges state department spokesman dennis 
harter in washington said its not the first time theyve said 
anything like that theyve said it fairly frequently 
we intend to abide by the panama canal treaties he added in 
an interview with the associated press we have been and we intend 
to continue to 
the united states imposed economic sanctions on panama earlier 
this year and expanded its military force along the canal in an 
effort to force gen manuel antonio noriega to step down 
noriega head of the armed forces and de facto leader of panama 
is under us indictment on charges of drug trafficking and money 
laundering he denies the accusations 
the foreign ministry statement alluded to a document issued last 
week by armys southern command saying that after 1999 the united 
states will continue showing its determination to support the 
neutrality and operation of the panama canal as well as regional and 
us security interests 
the southern command report said the us defense department 
approved a preliminary plan for an orderly phased withdrawal from 
panama but it did not give specific withdrawal dates it also 
said the southern command now operating along the banks of the 
panama canal will not be eliminated when us military presence ends 
in panama however it did not say where the southern command will 
be located 
the us army has about 13000 troops assigned to the southern 
command about 3000 of whom arrived in march to add pressure on 
noriega

the energy department may have to shut more 
nuclear weapons facilities because president reagan is not proposing 
enough money to operate them in accordance with safety and 
environmental laws the washington post said in its sunday editions 
the newspaper cited a letter in which energy secretary john s 
herrington warned the administration that the proposed 1990 budget 
fell short by 360 million 
i must in good conscience advise you that the system will 
in all likelihood be operating beyond the bounds of acceptable 
risk herrington said in the dec 9 letter to white house chief of 
staff kenneth m duberstein 
spokespersons for the energy department and the white house were 
not available for comment after the story appeared 
according to the post the letter contains a detailed assessment 
of the energy departments budgetary problems which herrington said 
may require choosing between upgrading plant safety and meeting the 
defense departments production goals for nuclear materials 
if the department gives priority to production goals the paper 
quoted herrington then unresolved environmental and safety issues 
are likely to lead to further shutdowns in the weapons complex 
herringtons letter cites years of budget austerity combined with 
the reagan military buildup that put more demands on the system 
part of todays problem stems from our attempts to stretch 
defer and absorb budgetary shortfalls hoping that next year things 
would be better and we could catch up the post quoted herrington 
as a result the countrys ability to produce and maintain a 
nuclear weapons stockpile is in serious jeopardy herrington said 
in the letter the risk is great that without a significant 
increase in resources over the next five years we will no longer be 
able to sustain a strong nuclear deterrent in which we have invested 
57 billion since 1980 
the energy department which operates 17 weapons plants has 
proposed spending 50 billion in the next 20 years to build new 
facilities and correct the most pressing environmental problems 
herrington told duberstein his department would pay for 200 
million in upgrades at its savannah river plants in south carolina 
by using the last of a contingency fund he said the action will 
reduce the fund to zero and leave no cushion for emergencies 
in addition the department has said it will help clear up a 
nuclear waste problem endangering the operation of the denverarea 
rocky flats plant which handles plutonium 
herringtons letter according to the post indicated the 
department is in line for a 900 million budget increase next year 
more than 8 percent higher than its current 12 billion budget the 
secretary said the problems at savannah river and rocky flats will 
result in a 360 million shortfall according to the post

gun crashed on the north end of the air stations northsouth 
runway the air station is located on the eastern side of san 
francisco bay 
one crew member was rescued about half an hour later by a passing

guard lt michael sullivan 
two f14s landed without incident before a third plane struck the

a small crack has been discovered in a cooling 
pipe at a reactor at the savannah river plant nuclear facility but 
it should not affect next summers scheduled restart of the reactor 
energy department officials said saturday 
len sjostrom the department of energys acting assistant manager 
for reactor operations said that the crack in the 4inch pipe 
occurred in a weld area where two pipes join the augusta ga 
chronicle reported in sundays editions 
the pipe supplies cooling water to reactor control rods which 
are raised and lowered within the reactor vessel to control the 
fission process 
sjostrom said the crack was detected friday by ultrasonic tests 
during a routine check of the reactors piping he said he thought 
this was the first crack found in the reactors piping this year 
all three srp reactors known as the k l and p reactors have 
been shut down since summer for safety upgrades and maintenance 
they are the nations only source of tritium a radioactive gas used 
to boost the power of nuclear weapons 
because tritium decays 55 percent annually some federal 
officials say the nation could face forced reductions in nuclear 
weapons unless the reactors are restarted soon 
in washington richard w starostecki the energy departments 
deputy assistant secretary for safety health and quality assurance 
said he was sending a team of experts to the weapons plant next week 
to assess the situation the new york times reported in sundays 
editions 
sjostrom said replacing the pipe would not delay restart 
because we have the time to do it and especially because its 
a smaller pipe 
the k reactor crack was discovered the same day energy department 
officials said a separate crack found earlier in the l reactor 
presented no major safety problems and could have been caused by 
nearby welding 
sections of pipe are replaced when a crack penetrates more than 
50 percent of a pipe walls thickness or covering more than 20 
percent of the pipes circumference 
the l reactor pipe was removed under that rule and the pipe in 
the k reactor found cracked friday will be replaced even though it 
does not meet the criteria the augusta paper reported

the 516 millionperplane pricetag for the b2 
stealth bomber makes it the most expensive aircraft ever built but 
air force secretary edward c aldridge says whatever the 
radarevading plane costs its worth it 
the stealth bomber which resembles a huge tailless manta ray 
is expected to make its first flight early next year but will not be 
ready for wartime use until 1992 at the earliest aldridge said 
friday 
aldridge told a news conference the design development and 
construction of 132 planes was expected to cost 681 billion by the 
time production ends in mid1995 
expressed in terms of the original estimate the price tag has 
grown from 366 billion to 425 billion in fiscal 1981 dollars 
an increase of about 16 percent aldridge said those figures do not 
reflect cost increases caused by inflation since 1981 or that 
projected in future years
