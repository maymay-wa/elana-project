some college administrators who felt he hurt womens athletics 
during his time in office 
president reagan did a lot of good things but it just happens 
he didnt dolopiano womens athletic director of the university of texas 
reagans record on womens athletics is abysmal he set it 
back 10 years he was also the worst education president in the 
last 40 years said lopiano 
there was no organized protest during the twohour award dinner 
but several women refused to stand with the rest of the crowd when 
reagan was introduced for the theodore roosevelt award 
the former presidnt made no reference to the controversy in his 
remarks to the audience of 2000 and joked nancy has my 
football sweater from eurek3ollege and wait until i come home

choice he was president when title ix was promulgated 
congress passed title ix in 1972 forcing colleges and 
universities to provide equal opportunity to males and females at 
any school receiving federal funds the act appliel sainly to 
athletic programs 
in 1984 the supreme court tightened the language of the act in 
effmcj striking down title ix in regard to athletics since no

act was passed by congress but vetoed by reagan congress 
however overrode his veto which restored the act

not long ago it looked as if home 
shopping network incs picture tube had gone kaput 
the television retailer was losing money for the first time a 
big lawsuit against gte corp boomeranged into a 100 million libel 
award for the telecommunications giant analysts and investors were 
ready to play taps for the company that had popularized zirconium 
cube jewelry peddled live on tv 
the tune has changed home shopping network is rebounding its 
stock has more than doubled since hitting a low of 3 in mid1989 
sales are setting records the gte issue was settled in november 
for 45 million in insurance 
what had been diagnosed as a fatal cash hemorrhage turned out to 
be just a neardeath experience that led to some serious rethinking 
by oncecocky hsn executives 
the one thing you can say about home shopping network is it 
takes a licking and keeps on ticking said peter grandich a 
securities analyst at affiliated financial management inc in 
howell nj after the gte award everyone thought the party was 
over 
the relatively painless resolution with gte was a fortuitous 
boost for the 4yearold company now leaner after shedding several 
unprofitable ventures to concentrate on tv sales operations 
but hsn no longer is the undisputed titan of the tv marketplace 
following the merger of two rivals it also is engrossed in another 
courtroom brawl this time with junkbond investment firm drexel 
burnham lambert inc 
that battle which could determine the value of 100 million 
worth of hsn securities issued in 1986 illustrates the companys 
crash landing after years of heady expansion 
in dispute are bonds that pay interest of 55 percent and are 
convertible to hsn stock they were an immediate hit reflecting 
investor confidence in the clearwater flabased company that had 
dazzled tv viewers with buying opportunities on items ranging from 
ersatz diamond rings to vitamin pills 
the price of hsn shares climbed to 47 making the convertible 
bonds even more attractive 
but rising costs and unprofitable diversification began to erode 
gains and the stock weakened it took a big beating after hsn 
became mired in the 15 billion suit against stamford connbased 
gte claiming an inadequate telephone system cost hsn 500 million 
in business in 1986 and 87 
when the date arrived to reset the bonds conversion rate in 
1987 hsn shares were worth a fraction of their earlier value 
drexel the bonds underwriter negotiated a conversion rate of 
705 a share down from the original 2850 
before the change could take effect however hsn sued in 
federal court in tampa claiming drexel artificially manipulated hsn 
stock down to get the lower conversion price on the bonds 
hsn claimed drexels motive was to reap huge profits by selling 
the bonds later if hsns stock price rose drexel is fighting the 
suit and a hearing is set for jan 17 in tampa federal court 
for its fiscal quarter ending nov 30 hsn reported sales up 27 
percent from a year earlier to a quarterly record 2552 million 
aftertax profit nearly doubled to more than 20 million 
to paraphrase twain reports of our death were greatly 
exaggerated said nando difilippo hsns general counsel 
hsn also plans to discontinue its financial service operations 
and scale down a pharmaceutical unit to include only its line of 
vitamins hsn now reaches about half the nations homes via cable 
or regular channels 
were going to stick with the business we do best video 
retailing said les wandler hsns chief financial officer 
when you have a gold mine you mine gold you dont go looking 
for other business we learned that 
the merger of two competitors cvn cos of minneapolis and qvc 
network of west chester pa could pose a strategic threat to hsn 
which tried unsuccessfully in 1987 to merge with cvn but hsn 
executives say they arent worried 
the more people get used to buying off television the better 
off everyone in the industry is wandler said 
larry gerbrandt a media analyst at paul kagen associates in 
carmel calif said the hsn stock could dip if bondholders 
exercise their stockconversion option once the drexel suit is 
resolved 
but he said assets such as its st petersburgbased studios and 
cable network give hsn intrinsic value 
i see hsn well north of 12 a share he said 
the gte suit was a misadventure that totally distracted home 
shopping network from its core business said gerbrandt 
theyve gotten a second chance

after 10 years of focusing on shuttles 
nasa plans 64 space exploration missions this decade creating a 
data deluge that could swamp an agency already drowning in 
information thats never been studied 
we will acquire in the next three years what its taken 25 
years to get said james green director of the national space 
science data center at goddard space flight center the volume will 
double every two years after that with a virtual information 
explosion in 1996 from the earth observing system 
eos is expected to transmit more data in 30 hours than is 
already stored from 25 years of space travel before eos the next 
three years should see the launch of the cosmic background 
explorer the galileo mission to jupiter the hubble space 
telescope gamma ray observer ulysses mission to the sun the mars 
observer and the topex poseidon oceansensing satellite 
scientists hope eos will yield data to such solve threats to the 
earths survival as global warming and the thinning of the 
protective ozone layer 
the critical question is whether it will be in a form they can 
use 
industry hasnt developed hardware or software to serve the 
demands of disciplines as diverse as anthropology zoology and 
atmospheric physics so it has been up to government scientists to 
pioneer solutions that have put nasa at the cutting edge but still 
short of making computerized data easily usable 
observers say part of the problem lies with nasa itself the 
agency traditionally has been most willing to cut funds for 
archiving data if it ran short of money when launching a space 
mission it is undergoing a change in focus too moving from an 
era of general space exploration to one of information gathering 
and funding for that lags 
in the fiscal 1990 budget the data center received 47 million 
for managing archiving and distributing data up from the 1989 
budget allocation of 32 million by comparison nasas entire 
1990 budget was 125 billion 
green likens the data analysis and management after a space 
launch to the the last puppy that comes to supper if theres 
too many puppies theres not much left but while he agreed his 
area frequently gets short shrift he said funding increases show 
the agency is moving in the right direction 
the thing is you dont put the space probes up there for no 
reason said david dickerson an aide to rep bill nelson 
dfla chairman of the house space science subcommittee the 
distance they travel is not whats important its the information 
they send back theyre going to have to put increasing amount of 
thought and resources to that 
alan robock a university of maryland meteorologist who is 
testing nasa techniques for improving accessibility to data said 
the fault isnt just with the space agency computers and data 
analysis are not nearly as sexy theyre harder to sell to 
congress 
william campbell a nasa artificial intelligence expert is 
developing techniques to build intelligence into the data 
gathering increasingly fast and sensitive instruments can gather 
data faster than anyone can analyze or catalog it campbell said 
its not just the volume its the complexity 
he and other nasa scientists believe they are on the brink of 
developing systems that would put the data in usable form almost 
from the time instruments capture it in space by analyzing it with 
the users needs in mind 
the idea is to build intelligence into the whole system from 
the back end to the user he said this is a whole new way of 
thinking about the problem i contend it is the only hope 
in the five years since green took over the space science data 
center has gone from a tape landfill to concentrating on data 
accessibility but as it struggles toward answers to the pending 
data deluge it is burdened with catching up from years of neglect 
of approximately 80000 magnetic tapes dating to the early 1960s 
that are in a climatecontrolled federal warehouse in suitland 
about half need to be restored said robert mcguire who heads the 
project about 9000 have been restored since the effort began in 
july 1988 
another 30000 to 40000 tapes are at the space science data 
center 
under green the centers goals shifted from storage to 
accessibility and he said it now handles 6000 requests a year up 
from 2000 five years ago using new computer networks to 
universities and research centers electronic mail and the postal 
service data in demand on climate atmosphere and other subjects 
are online in the computer in 15 systems that information is 
stored on magnetic diskettes or highdensity optical disks that 
hold as much as 40 of the sequential magnetic tapes and let the 
user go right to the needed data 
if the technology doesnt exist to manage data beamed back from 
eos the instruments should be monitored only some of the time or 
not launched green said it doesnt do anybody any good if we 
cant manage the data

the communist leaders of isolated 
albania europes last bastion of stalinism have staunchly denied 
any intention of relinquishing their independence and following the 
trend toward democracy in eastern europe 
but communist leader ramiz alia may come under increasing 
pressure to change both from abroad and inside the country where 
cautious reforms increasingly conflict with adherence to the rigid 
communism of albanias founding father enver hoxha 
there were unconfirmed reports of unrest at tirana universitys 
student dorms last summer yugoslav media in reports denied by 
albanian officials have spoken of antigovernment protests in the 
cities of shkodra and korca last fall 
king leka i the pretender to albanias throne who has lived in 
south africa for the past 10 years said in an interview published 
friday that leaflets urging albanians to overthrow their hardline 
government will be dropped by balloon into the closed balkan nation 
bordering the adriatic 
albanian emigre groups in europe meanwhile are said by the 
yugoslav news agency tanjug to have petitioned west european 
parliaments to help the albanians win freedom 
outwardly alia has shown no sign of yielding to such pressure 
in a new years message to his people he denounced what he called 
a foreign campaign of slanders to get albania to follow the 
democratic trends in eastern europe 
the very reference to eastern europe and the specific reference 
to campaigns abroad may indicate that alia faces questions about 
reform at home 
on dec 12 alia justified the refusal to follow eastern europe 
by stressing that albania which severed ties with moscow in 1961 
and china in 1978 is not like other communist countries 
processes like those in eastern europe will not occur in 
albania he said albania and eastern europe have developed 
along completely different ideological political economic and 
social roads he added 
albania is the last east european country to revere josef 
stalin whose giant statue stands in the capital tirana 
even more important is hoxha he died in 1985 but his name 
remains sacred for albanias leaders who last year opened a 
costly grandiose museum in tirana that is intended to enshrine his 
every deed and word in the national memory 
vistors to tirana report that groups of schoolchildren are 
guided repeatedly through the museum as part of their rigid 
education as loyal citizens of albania 
yet there are signs that young people particularly are 
increasingly influenced by the italian yugoslav and greek 
television broadcasts that amuse them instead of albanian tv which 
broadcasts only in the evening 
the attitude of the young whose protests sparked the 
revolutions that toppled orthodox communists in east germany 
czechoslovakia and romania is particularly important in albania 
which has one of the highest birthrates in europe 
perhaps because of youths importance louis zanga an albanian 
specialist at the usfinanced radio free europe radio station 
noted in august and september an unusual discussion of taboo topics 
such as youths love of rock music and fashions they cant find in 
albanian stores 
according to zanga youth union leader mehmet elezi criticized 
conservative bureaucrats for their handling of a poll of young 
people who on guarantee of anonymity unexpectedly spoke of their 
love for rock music 
tomorrow in a similar situation young people will not 
respond for fear of getting into trouble elezi reportedly said 
and how will we then be able to figure out their thoughts 
media in neighboring yugoslavia which accuses albania of 
fomenting unrest in its southern province of kosovo have detected 
some other signs of change 
the belgrade daily politika noted for example that a book 
recently published by a former albanian interior minister neshat 
tozai described apparently for the first time harassment by the 
dreaded sigurimi or security police 
romanias 23 million citizens eventually rose up against nicolae 
ceausescus equally feared security network but there are only 32 
million albanians to control and they have been virtually cut off 
from the world since 1944 far longer than romanians 
but over the past two years cultural exhibitions have brought 
albanians glimpses of west german and french arts popular italian 
singers toured last fall 
ambiguities abound in politics and economics alia in an 
apparent effort to assure albanians they live in a democracy 
constantly exhorts officials to be closer to the people yet 
asserts that only communists can rule 
in the staterun economy official plans are constantly reported 
to be more than fulfilled yet every leaders speech talks of 
deformations and problems in industry and agriculture 
a severe drought last year caused rationing of energy much of 
which comes from hydropower and alias bleak new years message 
was more of the same economic austerity measures are demanded 
everywhere he said

bridget mergens and a group of friends wanted 
to start a high school club something like the chess club only 
they would discuss the bible 
five years later bridget mergens mayhew now married and the 
mother of a 13monthold girl is making her first trip to 
washington to listen to arguments before the us supreme court in 
a case that could provide an important ruling on churchstate 
relations 
the court will hear an appeal tuesday by omaha westside high 
school officials who say allowing a bible study group to meet at 
the school after class would violate the constitutionally required 
separation of church and state 
mrs mergens mayhew came from a roman catholic family joined an 
interdenominational church group in high school and now is a member 
of the assembly of god she wasnt expecting trouble when she asked 
to start the bible group 
we wanted to be like the chess club but talk about biblical 
things she said friday it scared the school so much 
by accepting the case the justices agreed to review a 1984 
federal law requiring that student religious groups receive the 
same access as other extracurricular clubs to public high school 
facilities 
westside school officials said a school policy requiring clubs 
to be curriculumrelated and have a school sponsor meant their 
decision to keep out the bible club was not in violation of the 
federal equal access act 
principal james findley said he initially thought no 
problem when miss mergens then a senior said others at the 
1500student school wanted to get together to read the bible and 
pray the problem arose when the students wanted the group to be 
recognized as a club meeting after school hours he said 
school officials saw that as a violation of the separation of 
church and state and had other concerns findley said 
our interpretation was once we let that group meet we would 
have to let any group meet he said if a satanist club wanted 
to meet we think wed have to allow that to happen those were our 
concerns 
school officials said students are free to discuss religious 
subjects but they cant expect the school to endorse them and 
permit equal access to all school resources 
mrs mergens mayhew who lives in nearby bellevue said she 
feels the school discriminated against the students who wanted the 
bible group 
for me its a religious issue she said but its 
important for more than the religious community 
as the case went through the federal courts she found herself 
reading about the constitution and the nations founders 
they were religious men they were godly men they didnt want 
one colony to push one religion on them they wanted to pursue it 
on their own thats why they wrote the constitution the way they 
did she said our forefathers were sharp guys 
the supreme court ruled in 1981 that state universities cannot 
ban student groups from using campus facilities for religious 
worship and study but the justices have not decided if the rule 
should apply to high schools 
in the mergens case a federal court ruled in favor of the 
school district but the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
overturned the decision 
the appeals court rejected the contention that high school 
students are more impressionable than college students and should 
be protected from student religious groups that may appear to be 
sanctioned by school authorities 
robert skolrood executive director of the national legal 
foundation which is helping mrs mergens mayhew said he would be 
terribly disappointed if the high court didnt uphold the 
appellate decision 
the students should be allowed to meet because it was their 
decision not the school establishing a religion he said that 
means the case could have implications for the question of school 
prayer he said 
students have every right to do it if its not the school 
determining it he said 
dick shugrue a creighton university law professor said the 
courts decision may be made on much narrower grounds 
those backing the mergens side believe if the case succeeds it 
will be a stake in the heart of the high courts 1963 ban on 
school prayer shugrue said 
the hope of the mergens supporters is that the court would 
say we made a tragic mistake by golly lets put god back in 
the public schools shugrue said

the countrys main black 
guerrilla movement said today that it would enter talks with south 
africas white rulers only if granted the same political freedom as 
the governing national party 
until that occurs the outlawed african national congress will 
seek to intensify its guerrilla campaign the organization said in 
a statement issued to mark its 78th anniversary 
president fw de klerk since taking office in midaugust has 
eased restrictions on black opposition activity freed several 
jailed anc leaders and offered to negotiate a new constitution 
that would extend political rights to blacks while protecting white 
interests 
the anc although reducing its guerrilla attacks to a low level 
in recent months has said it will not enter talks until de klerk 
lifts the state of emergency imposed in 1986 frees anc leader 
nelson mandela and other political prisoners and lifts bans on the 
anc and other militant opposition groups 
the anc said its forces would not be terrorized into 
negotiations and could not be expected to enter into such a process 
until they enjoyed the same freedom to engage in political activity 
as did the ruling national party 
anc guerrilla commanders will remain at their active posts 
committed to the intensification of our armed offensive against the 
violent apartheid system the statement said the peoples army 
must further develop its combat capacity inside the country so 
that it becomes a formidable force capable of delivering telling 
blows against the apartheid regime on a continuous and nationwide 
basis 
undeer apartheid the countrys 28 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
the anc said de klerk still has a long way to go before he 
could claim so have ended repression it said the government bore 
full responsibility for ensuring that negotiations toward a 
peaceful settlement took place 
the statement was issued by anc headquarters in lusaka zambia 
and was distributed in south africa by the independent south 
african press association

oklahoma may be the state song but 
that doesnt mean its the states song 
oklahoma tourism officials discovered that recently when they 
used the song in television ads 
the tourism department paid more than 17000 to play parts of 
the song in commercials to attract tourists from neighboring states 
when tourism director glenn sullivan learned the state had paid 
to use its own state song in a nonprofit endeavor he asked his 
staff to see if a refund was possible 
a staffer uncovered a letter from lyricist oscar hammerstein ii 
that had been entered into the 1953 legislative journal after a 
similar dispute 
tell your readers and all the people of oklahoma that not only 
may they play and sing it anywhere and everywhere to their hearts 
content but that we want them and urge them to do so 
hammersteins letter said 
his only restrictions were that the song not be used in a play 
or against any dramatic background 
but officials from albertco which now owns rights to the 
rodgers and hammerstein musical oklahoma said friday they 
would not grant a refund 
albertco said the published copy of hammersteins letter was not 
signed and is not legally binding 
tourism spokesman steve paris said the company appears to have a 
strong case he said the department still may ask the attorney 
general for an opinion 
tourism advertising manager dennis donaldson said it hardly 
seems fair that the state should have to continue paying to use the 
song or change the ads 
after all we let them use our state to do a play

ian charleson the scottish actor who raced his 
way to stardom playing a runner in the oscarwinning movie 
chariots of fire has died at age 40 of complications from aids 
charleson was suffering from septicemia a blood disease and 
died saturday said his agent michael whitehall 
english actor ian mckellen said charleson was the most 
unmannered and unactorish of actors always truthful always 
honest 
mckellen said sunday night that charleson was a very talented 
actor and singer whose hamlet cut right through the accretions of 
the centuries he was a living modern 
he received wide acclaim when he replaced daniel day lewis last 
fall as shakespeares tormented dane in the production at londons 
royal national theater charlesons last performance came just nine 
weeks ago 
after nearly four hours on stage he was given a standing 
ovation whitehall said it was clear that he was exhausted but 
his courage not only in being on that stage but giving us the 
performance of his life left our applause and cheers seeming very 
inadequate 
john peter in the sunday times of london called charleson a 
princely hamlet every inch the king he should have been 
earlier the actor won praise in three american shows at the 
same theater the musical guys and dolls playing sky 
masterson sam shepards fool for love as the violently 
passionate eddie and tennessee williamss cat on a hot tin 
roof as the selflacerating brick 
charleson found his widest public in hugh hudsons 1981 hit film 
chariots of fire playing christian runner eric liddell who 
refuses to run on sunday because he doesnt believe in competition 
on the sabbath 
the film won the academy award for best picture 
other movies included the 1982 oscarwinning gandhi as a 
priest who befriends the indian leader and the comedy car 
trouble opposite his fool for love costar julie walters 
the son of a printer charleson was born in edinburgh on aug 
11 1949 he won a scholarship to the capitals royal high school 
and studied architecture at edinburgh university 
he turned to acting while at the london academy of music and 
dramatic art and began his stage career with a twoyear stint at 
the young vic theater from 1972 to 1974 
the bulk of his stage work was for britains two major 
statesubsidized theaters his first roles at the national were in 
julius caesar and volpone in 1977 credits at the royal 
shakespeare company include loves labors lost and the 
tempest 
charleson appeared last year alongside mckellen in a benefit 
performance of martin shermans play bent about the nazi 
persecution of homosexuals during world war ii 
unlike broadway which has lost many leading figures to aids 
particularly in the musical theater the british arts world has 
been much less dramatically affected 
mckellen said the charleson family deserved praise for making 
public the cause of his death 
its still very unusual for people in the public eye to say 
they are hiv positive that they have aids said mckellen 
whats wonderful is that the first tribute to him is that his 
family should acknowledge the reason for his death 
there will be a private family funeral in scotland later this 
week and a memorial service in london later in the year whitehall 
said

on a 12acre patch of shrubs and tall grass 
sits the boardedup shell of a longabandoned dinner theater a few 
miles away a tony country club produces tennis players and 
promises future profits 
they seem to have little in common but both carry a 19 
million pricetag and are listed among hundreds of pieces of real 
estate for sale as federal regulators try to unload properties held 
by problem thrifts 
there are no for sale signs in front of the thousand oaks 
racquet club but members have been wondering aloud whats been 
happening to their dues since the federal government took over the 
savings and loan that foreclosed on the property 
we do have people who come in here and say i know this is 
owned by the bank and the bank is owned by the government and how 
safe are my dues said liz gallacher the new manager 
the club boasts the only indoor tennis courts in san antonio as 
well as outdoor courts a large swimming pool and seven acres of 
land in a vibrant commercial area of the city 
club officials say control of thousand oaks built in 1976 was 
passed among several owners and managers before mission savings 
association foreclosed and took over the property in december 1988 
it is now owned by mission texas corp a subsidiary of the 
thrift now controlled by the federal deposit insurance corp the 
club has been on the market about two months at 19 million 
its one of 19 million worth of mission properties for sale 
said mission president keith klein 
klein describes the racquet club as an incomegenerating 
property ms gallacher said she hopes the club will turn a profit 
pretty soon although she offered no timetable 
so why sell 
were not in the health club business klein said 
the sale also fits the bush administrations strategic plan for 
bailing out the nations savings and loans the plan released 
wednesday instructs regulators to start selling real estate and 
other assets from insolvent thrifts even before the government 
officially closes the institutions 
the resolution trust corp created in august and run by the 
fdic controls 281 sampls with combined assets of 104 billion the 
agency expects to take over 200 other institutions with total 
assets of about 150 billion roughly half the assets are real 
estate covering tens of thousands of properties across the country 
a few miles from thousand oaks the former fiesta theater 
playhouse sits amid largely vacant land in san antonios northern 
suburbs the bexar savings association like mission savings a 
small player in the thrift crisis and also under federal control 
is trying to sell the dilapidated dinner theater 
the building is in absolutely deplorable condition because of 
vandals and thieves and robbers and plunderers said realtor 
terry warth the 193 million asking price is justified by its 
1255 acres he said 
bexar savings officers said they had no history available on the 
property and warth said he knows little about the propertys 
financial history except that its been idle about five years 
at the country club the possibility of yet another new owner is 
seen is just one more step toward success 
ms gallacher said she hopes to stay as manager and rebuild 
membership which has fallen to about 600 from a peak of 850 
shes trying to bolster its tennis pro roster which now 
includes the wellknown womens coach from trinity university 
emily foster 
its just going to take some hard work and diligence to get 
things going and i dont see any reason for it to fail anymore 
ms gallacher said i plan on turning it around and making it a 
success

bush administration officials acknowledged 
sunday they have had some difficulties with colombian 
authorities over plans to deploy us warships near colombia to 
help intercept drug smugglers supply routes 
but national security adviser brent scowcroft blamed the 
problems on some premature and probably inaccurate leaks 
about us intentions and predicted officials in colombia and other 
latin american nations will come around 
president bush himself jogging after church sunday turned 
aside a question about whether he was positioning the aircraft 
carrier john f kennedy off the coast of colombia to help interdict 
drug supplies by sea and by air 
i will address myself to that question at a future date 
the president said before an outing on the towpath of the historic 
campo canal above the georgetown section of washington 
when a reporter said colombia doesnt want us warships off its 
coast bush injected we dont know all that 
however bogotas el tiempo published a communique sunday by the 
government of president virgilio barco that said the colombian 
government has not participated nor will it participate in any 
joint operation with united states military forces air or naval 
in the caribbean sea in international waters it has not 
participated nor will it and in territorial waters it has not 
authorized the operations nor is it considering authorizing 
them 
at a white house reception sunday night defense secretary dick 
cheney declined to say where the kennedy or other ships were now 
but told reporters were always active down in the caribbean 
anyway 
cheney said he expects that within two weeks we will announce 
in detail what additional steps were taking in dealing with the 
narcotics problem he said he expects the latin nations and 
anybody interested in halting the flow of illicit drugs into the 
united states will be supportive 
gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said were not blockading colombia we always have ships in 
international waters 
on abctvs this week with david brinkley scowcroft said 
we are looking at ways we might be able to improve interdiction 
across the caribbean however he said discussions with colombian 
authorities have not begun 
there have been some difficulties said scowcroft who 
blamed them on some premature and probably inaccurate leaks 
about what we had in mind 
the term that was in the paper for example is blockade 
now thats a very thats a warlike negative term what we would 
be doing is if we did anything down there would be a 
cooperative effort in conjunction with the countries there to help 
get better control of the drug traffickers said scowcroft 
i think itll work out he predicted 
pentagon sources said saturday the jfk has been chosen to lead 
an antidrug interdiction effort off the colombian coast but final 
decisions about when the warship may be put to work have not been 
made 
the jfk and an accompanying guided missile cruiser the uss 
virginia left norfolk va on thursday for what the pentagon said 
were routine training exercises in the atlantic 
the white house acknowledged dec 28 that bush had instructed 
the us military to draw up plans for interdicting drug supply 
routes from south and central america 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said then the final plans were still 
being made but added we have decided to take certain actions to 
help the countries of latin america interdict these supply routes 
the new york times reported in sundays editions that colomian 
officials were balking at the stationing of us vessels off its 
coast and had refused to meet last week with an american team sent 
to explain the plan 
the times said the pentagon wants to put groundbased radar 
units in the mountains of colombia bolivia and peru to be run by 
americans and military officers from those countries 
the us invasion of panama on dec 20 to topple dictator manuel 
antonio noriega has rekindled old fears in latin america about us 
intervention in the region 
bush is scheduled to attend a drug summit feb 15 in cartagena 
colombia with the presidents of colombia brazil and peru 
peruvian president alan garcia who said after the panama invasion 
he would not attend the summit announced sunday he will go if the 
united states withdraws its troops from panama by then 
bush and his wife barbara went to st johns church across 
lafayette square from the white house with the presidents sister 
nancy ellis widowed just nine days earlier 
afterwards while mrs bush went for her daily swim in the white 
houses heated outdoor pool bush and his younger sister drove to 
the camp0 canal where she walked and he walked and jogged 
threemile run twomile walk bush boasted as he finished 
his nearly hourlong regimen beside the nearly frozen canal he was 
clad against the 39degree chill in a blue houston astros baseball 
jacket sweatpants and cap 
mrs ellis husband alexander ellis ii a massachusetts 
insurance executive died of a massive stroke on dec 29 at age 67

at least 6000 people were killed in 
sri lanka in 1989 in political violence associated with an uprising 
by ultranationalist sinhalese and a rebellion by tamil 
separatists military officials say 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said at 
least 500 people were killed each month as the sinhalese militant 
movement gained momentum and tamil rebels turned their guns against 
other members of their ethnic minority 
the officials were speaking in response to a newspaper report 
published sunday that said at least 12000 people were killed 
during the year the sunday times said an average of 1000 people 
died each month quoting unidentified military sources 
the tamil separatist revolt which began in 1983 has claimed at 
least 11000 lives at first the sri lankan army tried to quell 
the secessionist campaign then indian peacekeeping troops made an 
attempt 
the fighting now appears to have shifted to a battle for control 
of tamildominated regions of the country between the rebels and 
moderates who accept regional autonomy in exchange for giving up 
the seccessionist campaign 
the indian soldiers are scheduled to leave sri lanka by march 
31 ending a military deployment that began in july 1987 after 
abortive peace overtures to the rebels by the colombo government 
the overtures coupled with the indian military presence 
spawned a backlash by ultranationalist sinhalese militants that 
has escalated into an uprising against the government 
the sinhalese movement launched in 1987 has claimed at least 
6000 lives the killings include hitandrun attacks on government 
supporters by the militants and revenge killings of suspected 
militants by progovernment vigilante groups 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
while tamils account for 18 percent 
tamils launched their separatist agitation amid complaints that 
the sinhalese majority which controls the government and military 
discriminates against them in jobs and education

as a boy growing up on a western 
minnesota dairy farm calvin sperling would comb the douglas county 
countryside collecting bits of plants and trees 
today he travels the globe for the us government searching 
for hundreds of rare and threatened plants that scientists say 
could help feed the planet and save american farmers billions of 
dollars 
as a plant explorer and botanist for the agriculture department 
sperling leads the governments efforts to find seeds of endangered 
species of plants that scientists may someday use to produce better 
varieties of food crops 
sperling hunted for wild lentils and chickpeas in turkey last 
spring he has explored forests in the interior of the soviet union 
for wild apples gone to israel to collect wild wheat and searched 
south american jungles for potato relatives 
ive always had an interest in what was over the next hill 
you might say sperling said in a recent interview at his office 
at usdas agricultural research service 
the future of commercial agriculture could depend on what 
sperling finds 
while whole species of plants are threatened with extinction 
scientists need seeds or germplasm from existing sometimes wild 
varieties of plants to breed the hardier higheryielding crops 
farmers need 
sperlings expeditions provide the raw material for 
biotechnology says donald falk director of harvard universitys 
center for plant conservation 
biotechnology is the future of global agriculture global 
agriculture is the future of being able to feed 10 billion 
people falk said 
what sperling does is so critical to the future of agriculture 
fortune magazine jan 1 named him one of the years 25 most 
fascinating business people 
in his starched shirt and silk tie the wellcoiffed 32yearold 
hardly looks like a botanist who spends weeks at a time crawling 
through brush and jungles in some of the worlds most remote 
regions 
but sperling has had an insatiable curiosity about wild plants 
since he was 12 the alexandria minn native moved from his 
obsession with douglas county flora to study botany at north dakota 
state university later earning advanced degrees in biology at 
harvard 
he joined the agriculture department as a research assistant 
three years ago and was given a permanent position last year as the 
only plant explorer in usdas germplasm services laboratory 
its sperlings job to determine the governments priorities for 
locating the seeds that should be added to its already extensive 
collection 
more than 250000 seed samples are kept in cold storage at 
usdas national seed storage laboratory in fort collins colo 
other samples are stored at an additional 40 locations around the 
country 
a lot of what we do is literally banking were saving things 
that we may need tomorrow sperling said we need to preserve 
as much diversity as we can so its available 
seeds arrive at fort collins from a variety of sources in 
addition to sperlings expeditions other scientists farmers seed 
companies foreign countries and gardeners among the billions of 
seeds in the collection are soybeans from china rice from japan 
and corn from brazil 
at proper temperatures seeds can survive 100 years or more 
what seeds usda scientists can obtain through exchanges with 
foreign governments they do what they cant its sperlings 
responsibility to find 
he may go himself as he did with his trip to the soviet union 
last year for wild apple seeds and cuttings that could lead to 
hardier varieties of the fruit or sperling may provide money and 
technical assistance to university researchers 
sperling spends a quarter of the year in the field the rest 
deciding what should be collected next 
his list of priorities runs from wild cranberries and grapes in 
the united states to wild wheat in north africa and alfalfa in 
southwest asia 
cranberries for example are one of the few crops native to 
america but scientists have never fully surveyed the various wild 
varieties for their useful genetic traits sperling said 
the best cranberry relish ive had was made from cranberries 
in minnesota he said 
harvards falk thinks usdas plant exploration is still vastly 
underfunded but he says sperling has succeeded in steering the 
governments efforts to a wider variety of crops 
one thing he has done with the program is branch into a lot of 
new crops falk said traditionally the government would 
make sort of a halfhearted investment now theres a much more 
aggressive program for a broad range of plant materials

despite the bush administrations declared war 
on drugs fewer than 10 percent of the nations cities report 
making headway in their local battles according to a survey 
released today 
theres been a lot of talk about drugs coming out of 
washington and our city leaders are now sending back a message a 
message that its time for washington to get a frontline report on 
whats happening and whats needed alan beals executive 
director of the national league of cities said in releasing the 
study 
the drug issue must be a national priority local officials 
are saying because they cannot beat it on their own he said 
officials in 58 percent of cities surveyed said drug problems 
had worsened in their communities over the past year another 31 
percent said the magnitude of the drug problem remained the same 
while only 9 percent reported progress 
the league surveyed elected municipal officials mayors and 
council members from 314 cities selected randomly from the 2461 
cities with a population of 10000 or more the survey included 
questions on a variety of topics 
officials in 39 percent of the cities said they would have to 
raise local taxes this year 
nearly half expect to increase various user fees and almost 
twothirds say their citys spending will increase beals said 
the league survey was conducted by telephone in november and 
early december by the center for urban studies at wayne state 
university in detroit the league said the results have a margin of 
error of plus or minus 55 percentage points 
drugs led the list of top concerns of city officials one in 
five said that if they could meet with bush on any topic they 
would focus on drugs 
clearly our local leaders believe there is a need for national 
leadership and a stronger commitment of national resources to help 
eradicate the poisonous and violent drug culture that has invaded 
our cities beals said 
the survey he said found discontent among urban leaders with 
the federal governments allocation of money to fight drugs the 
22 billion in federal drug assistance goes to the states he 
said but its needed in our cities where the war against drugs 
is being fought 
he said the survey found nearly half 47 percent described 
relations with their state government as fair at best 22 
percent said they were poor and 28 percent said good 
other top concerns cited by the city officials as needing 
presidential attention were financial constraints and the lack of 
federal aid to go with federally required local programs solid 
waste and other environmental problems education and affordable 
housing 
besides drugs city leaders reported worsening conditions 
involving the cost of living affordability of housing energy 
costs crime and solid waste

the veterans affairs department is hinting it 
will try to pull out of the mobile home loan business this year 
saying a high default rate among activeduty members of the armed 
services has compounded its losses 
the program begun in 1971 to help vietnam veterans returning to 
civilian life is popular among junior members of the armed forces 
who want to buy homes near bases for themselves and their fledgling 
families 
personnel on active duty are considered veterans for purposes of 
the program 
more than half the 31000 mobile home loans made since 1984 have 
gone to such activeduty personnel the va says during the same 
period the agency has had to pay some 147 million to lenders as a 
result of 17000 claims on mobile homes 
the va inspector general in a pair of reports in september and 
october said the program has suffered from defaults by borrowers 
in depressed oilproducing states and by military personnel who 
abandon their property after transfers 
the reports emphasized the problem with activeduty borrowers 
charles c partridge legislative counsel for the national 
association of uniformed services a multiservice advocacy group 
says that is unfair 
he blames a chickencoop mentality in the defense department 
that ignores the housing needs of soldiers and the lack of programs 
to help them make sound purchasing decisions or help them relocate 
the guy gets an order for korea whats he going to do 
partridge asked the dod says you bought it youve got to sell 
it 
that problem may be helped with the implementation of a 
relocation program mandated for this year by congress 
the pentagon says there is nearly always a shortage of onbase 
housing making alternatives necessary a mobile home mortgage 
averages about 23000 compared with 73000 for a sitebuilt home 
the recommendation to end the program is contained both in the 
september inspector generals report on the program and in an 
inspector generals audit of the entire department a month later 
the september report was made available only recently 
both reports clearly state that r john vogel va head of 
benefits agreed to propose legislation in 1990 to end the program 
however recently asked directly about the timetable for such a 
proposal the vas keith pedigo said only that the idea was under 
active consideration with a final decision expected by the end 
of january 
weve assessed the report and we believe that given the 
pitfalls of owning a manufactured home that most veterans would be 
better off not availing themselves of this benefit said pedigo 
who reports to vogel as director of the vas loan guaranty service 
the top purchaser of a manufactured home is an e3 or e4 
stationed at fort bragg nc pedigo said oneandahalf 
years later hes rotated on his duty assignment to germany or 
somewhere else 
e4s are the top grade of enlisted personnel corporals 
seamen airmen and specialist 4s and make about 950 a month 
those who live off base receive a housing allowance of 314 a month 
and a monthly food allowance of less than 150 tax free there are 
additional allowances based on regional costs 
the 1988 poverty level was slightly more than 12000 a year for 
a family of four although military personnel have benefits and 
privileges such as free medical and dental care in addition to 
pay 
pedigo said the trouble begins when a transferred soldier 
unable to sell the mobile home abandons it however he could not 
explain why the 1988 annual report of the va cited military 
transfers as the cause of only about 4 percent of foreclosures 
extensive obligations and curtailment of income were the 
most frequently cited reasons 
veterans organizations armed services advocacy groups and the 
mobile home industry acknowledge flaws in the program but argue 
against throwing out the baby with the bath water 
the pitfalls cited by the report include rapid depreciation of 
mobile homes and a system that includes less durable items such as 
furniture and other accessories in the invoice price inflating the 
value of the mortgage in relation to the value of the trailer 
under the va program private lenders make the mobile home 
loans with 40 percent of the amount up to 20000 guaranteed by 
the government the program has guaranteed more than 112000 loans 
valued at more than 2 billion 
recent efforts have been made to strengthen the program 
including a 5 percent downpayment requirement and a debttoincome 
formula that borrowers must meet 
the september report noted foreclosure rates of 28 percent to 40 
percent from 1980 to 1989 in colorado louisiana oklahoma and 
texas all energyproducing states 
the average foreclosure rate since the program began in 1971 is 
27 percent the inspector general says the comparable rate for 
sitebuilt homes is 5 percent since that homeloan program 
began in 1944 to help returning gis from world war ii 
the oilpatch depression has also caused problems and large 
losses in the vas regular homeloan program which has been 
criticized by the inspector generals office and the private 
mortgage industry 
the inspector generals september report says only 19 percent of 
the vietnamera veteran population and 18 percent of the veteran 
population overall are served by the six regional offices with the 
most loan guarantees since 1984 st petersburg winstonsalem 
waco texas houston atlanta and columbia sc

president bushs triumph over gen manuel 
antonio noriega temporarily obscures serious foreign policy 
problems that will make bushs second year in the white house a 
time of difficult decisions 
like bills and tax forms arriving after the new year the glow 
of burgeoning democracy in eastern and central europe is tempered 
by economic political and nationalist concerns 
the acclaim accorded bush in congress and by the public for 
flushing noriega out of the vatican embassy in panama makes little 
difference to latin americans concerned that the united states is 
reverting to a turnofthecentury policy of military intervention 
that provokes anger and resentment 
those concerns explain bushs decision to send vice president 
dan quayle to the region as a personal emissary of assurances 
that yankee imperialism has not come back 
back home bush must juggle the need to provide aid to panama 
damaged economically first by noriegas regime and then by the us 
intervention in the context of emerging democracies in eastern 
europe and a budget that has little or no room for new spending on 
foreign aid 
far more pressing and complicated than panama is the situation 
in central and eastern europe the revolution that swept oldline 
communist leaders from power in poland hungary east germany 
czechoslovakia and romania largely met the us test of peaceful 
transition moreover the new leaders are flirting in one way or 
another with capitalism to the delight of the businessminded 
bush administration 
the economic crash program in force in warsaw is making this a 
hard winter for poles electricity for households is up 400 
percent bread prices have jumped by 38 percent and coal for 
households by 600 percent 
the government has ended almost all price controls and poland is 
bracing for a surge of inflation without an increase in workers 
wages 
the 938 million in us aid that congress has authorized over 
three years to poland and hungary might cushion the impact of the 
painful drive to create the first marketoriented economy in 
eastern europe but the white house faces increased pressure from 
polands constituents in america to do more 
in romania and to an extent in east germany the mood is mean 
the summary execution of nicolae ceausescu and his wife elena 
and then the arrest of all the members of the romanian politburo 
suggest the victims of the old regime intend to even the score 
in east germany there are also signs of retribution that 
secretary of state james a baker iii found ominous on his visit to 
potsdam last month so far the main targets are former officials 
accused of corruption 
if the attacks spread there could be at least two consequences 
ethnic clashes in a revival of old nationalist animosities and an 
interruption or even a reversal of the rebuilding of the eastern 
economies 
senior bush administration officials see almost no likelihood 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev trying to cope with his 
own problems in the baltics and in some of the southern republics 
would use soviet troops against the revolutionaries 
however if soviet troops in east germany were attacked 
pressure would mount on gorbachev to protect them 
apart from limited economic aid the bush administration is 
trying a variety of approaches to keep the lid on and the reform 
progressing it supports stronger ties between the eastern 
countries and the european community of western europe it has 
called for international monitoring of elections and is using 
visits such as bakers to east germany as signs of supports 
summing up the situation a senior us official commented 
1989 was clearly a year of tremendous achievement the soviets 
lifted the hand of oppression and for that we are appreciative 
but the key role was the role of the people primarily attributable 
to the people 
once people have begun to secure their freedom we have to look 
at how they are going to form their governments that is an agenda 
for the international community

two agriculture department analysts say the 
1992 plan by the european economic community to bring a 
singlemarket approach to the 12nation trading bloc could mean 
benefits to american exporters including farmers 
a growing eec economy with reduced internal barriers should 
reduce business costs stimulate increased efficiency create new 
wealth and encourage the growth of us exports said richard b 
helm and clay m hamilton of the departments foreign agricultural 
service 
the analysts writing in the january issue of agexporter 
magazine added this should mean an expanded market as long as 
the community does not raise new barriers to compensated member 
states that may be hurt by the liberalized market 
helm and hamilton said the 1992 goal to harmonize tax and 
nontariff differences among member countries in the eec will 
include directives to carry out the plans its hoped that us 
agricultural exports will benefit as existing national laws imposed 
without scientific justification are removed 
however depending on how the 1992 directives are drafted and 
implemented us producers may have to adapt their products or be 
restricted from the eec market as a result of the harmonized 
standards the report said 
food and drink comprise the biggest industry in the eec and is 
probably the one that would benefit most from a single market 
the report said a recent study by the blocs commission identified 
more than 200 nontariff barriers in the food sector including 
requirements for labeling packaging and ingredients 
if harmonized food standards are to be put in place these 
measures should be abolished by the end of 1992 the report said 
however trade barriers in this area may be difficult to 
eliminate because of traditional protectionist pressures or a 
desire to maintain selfsufficiency

most specialized hog farmers had little to 
squeal about in 1987 a new agriculture department study shows 
the departments economic research service said us farms had 
103 billion in cash receipts in 1987 the most since 1982 
about 90000 of the nations 22 million farms had at least half 
of their production in hogs in 1987 and about 41 percent of those 
36700 hog farms reported at least 40000 worth of total 
agricultural production that year 
these 36700 farms met the agencys definition of specialized 
hog operations as used in the study 
only 18 percent of all us farms that produced any hogs were 
classified as specialized hog farms but they produced over 65 
percent of the hogs in the united states the report said 
hogs in turn amounted to about 76 percent of the specialized 
hog farms value of production in 1987 
by contrast the 53000 farms that specialized in hogs but had 
total production of less than 40000 in 1987 accounted for less 
than 5 percent of the total us hog sales 
the remaining 30 percent of hog sales were from 115000 farms 
with over 40000 total production but for which hogs were only a 
minor enterprise the report said 
in their analysis usda economists robert dubman and gregory 
hanson said that net returns described as the principal short 
run measure of financial health averaged 36376 for all 
specialized hog farms in 1987 and that average included 14 percent 
of the total farms that reported net losses that year 
net returns for specialized hog farms were higher than for 
specialized cattle and dairy farms the report said 
the average net returns for dairy and cattle farms were shown at 
26541 and 19616 respectively

agriculture department scientists have 
pinpointed the natural chemicals that make a ripened peach smell so 
good 
chemists robert j horvat james a robertson and glenn w 
chapman jr identified five specific compounds from treeripened 
fruit that when mixed together in the proper quantities are 
essential to that tantalizing peach smell 
the scientists work for the departments agricultural research 
service at the horticultural laboratory in athens ga a report 
about their studies was released here 
among other things the scientists found that the best smelling 
peaches have to be less than four hours from the tree but most 
commercial growers have to pick the fruit a little on the green 
side to the peaches can be shipped to market before they get soft 
or overly ripe horvat said 
eventually he said the studies may show when peaches can be 
picked for the best compromise between shelf life and aroma 
but for real peach aficionados the only answer to a perfect 
smelling peach may be a peach tree in the back yard horvat said

bengurion airport israel ap dressed in heavy overcoats and 
fur hats clutching babies and bulky suitcases the new soviet 
immigrants are arriving in the promised land 
most are driven to leave the soviet union because of a poor 
quality of life and limited opportunities antisemitism and a 
desire to taste freedom while the door stays open 
but unlike the first waves of soviet jewish immigrants few of 
the newcomers consider themselves pioneers ready to sacrifice 
everything to build a nation for the jewish people 
many are driven to israel only by the recent us immigration 
restrictions 
i cant call myself a zionist there was nothing of jewish 
tradition in my family said mikhail weinrub 28 who arrived 
recently with his wife rita 31 and two children 
the influx which jewish agency officials say could total 1 
million by the end of the decade could offset a downward trend in 
jewish population growth and have a dramatic impact on society and 
politics 
in 1989 soviet emigration reached a record 71509 of which 
11994 settled in israel and most of the rest in the united states 
israeli officials predict up to 50000 will arrive in the jewish 
state this year 
newcomers are led into bengurions immigration hall with its 
orange and green plastic chairs aging posters of israeli tourist 
sites and handwritten signs proclaiming in russian all jews are 
brothers 
the weinrubs both hydrogeologists from the black sea port of 
odessa said they had long nurtured a dream of leaving the soviet 
union largely because of antisemitism and economic hardship 
but going to israel did not seem remotely possible 
there were no links with israel at all people were afraid 
even to speak of it weinrub said 
weinrub weary from a sleepless night at moscows sheremetyevo 
airport a bus trip through budapest and a night flight to israel 
listed the reasons for emigrating as his blond wife rita paced 
nervously cradling 18monthold nella 
in odessa the family lived in a single room in a communal 
apartment shared by other families the windows looked onto a 
narrow dark passageway between two adjacent houses 
the only way to move out was to prove the room was dark and be 
placed on a waiting list for a new apartment in 10 to 15 years but 
first they needed a certificate of darkness from officials who 
demanded a bribe that amounted to several years salary or about 
460 to 780 
instead of seeking their own place to live they moved to a 
tworoom apartment they shared with weinrubs parents then to an 
apartment with ritas parents and finally lived with weinrubs aunt 
two years ago emigration restrictions were lifted and their 
life took a new turn 
they found a distant relative in israel who was saved by 
weinrubs grandmother from hunger during world war ii she provided 
an invitation which is needed to start emigration procedures 
early in july the weinrubs applied to emigrate they received a 
visa in october their parents who stayed behind helped the 
couple raise the 1500 in rubles they needed to cancel their 
soviet citizenship and make the trip 
in odessa there was also concern in the jewish community about 
antisemitic slogans shouted in the streets from rightwing youths 
and tensions with ukrainians over housing 
some literary magazines like moscow and nash sovremennik are 
simply antisemitic weinrub said there we read speeches from 
a gathering of russian federation writers and they declared they 
were not antisemitic they only hated jews this was very 
unpleasant 
other immigrants also listed antisemitism as a major motive 
behind the exodus 
there was antisemitism of course just now we heard 
that a pogrom was about to take place on the date of some official 
holiday and the jews stayed home for two days do you remember how 
i was hiding you in the house said brocha much 75 from 
khmelnitzkiy near kiev turning to her small grandson 
we got out only after the radio started to deny that there is 
going to be a pogrom she said 
most immigrants interviewed said they did not believe soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms will succeed 
living standards have dropped national tensions increased and 
the economy deteriorated during perestroika weinrub said of 
gorbachevs reform program i dont believe it would be 
successful 
for him the united states was never an option in part because 
he was put off by letters from friends and relatives who had gone 
to america 
i know what america is like what israel is like nobody knows 
and thats interesting he said i was very impressed by the 
fact that israel has managed to achieve such a level in just 40 
years 
the reasons are different for everyone for roman kopelovitch 
an athletic 24yearold engineer from minsk it was the environment 
yes ecology im an optimist by nature and i dont believe 
in jewish pogroms the situation in minsk was quite pleasant and 
stable he said 
but there is radiation he said referring to fallout from 
the april 1986 accident at the chernobyl nuclear reactor some 200 
miles from minsk the food products are poisoned by nitrates and 
hydrates and nobody cares 
kopelovitch waiting in line to see an immigration officer in a 
tiny airport cubicle said he preferred israel because he brought 
along a sick mother and a small child i would not be able to 
support them in the united states 
surveying the immigrantpacked hall where newcomers were 
filling out typed forms children played or slept in the chairs and 
a youth from uzbekistan clutched a cage of homing pigeons he said 
people are just fleeing from the soviet union from everyday 
hardships antisemitism and other troubles a minority is driven 
by ideology 
but there is something else you keep a lion in a cage and 
then you open a door and the lion leaps out maybe it was wellfed 
in the cage and who knows what will happen outside but the lion 
has been inside the cage for too long

the cia under president bushs direction in 1976 
continued paying manuel antonio noriega 110000 a year even though 
the former panamanian dictator had turned against the united 
states according to a new book 
journalist frederick kempes book said the payments were made 
even after noriega bribed us officials to obtain secret 
intelligence tapes and was linked to bombings aimed at american 
targets 
noriega had been ordered to stir things up by 
thenpanamanian dictator omar torrijos who hoped to pressure the 
united states to speed talks on handing over the panama canal 
according to the book divorcing the dictator 
at the same time noriega discovered an extensive us 
wiretapping operation in panama and bribed american officials to 
hand over copies of intelligence tapes according to excerpts of 
the book printed in this weeks newsweek magazine 
when the affair came to light lew allen jr then head of the 
national security agency wanted to send a message to other 
wouldbe turncoats by prosecuting noriega and others 
but cia director bush balked the book said this was an 
army matter he said and the embarrassed army had opted to keep 
the lid on 
bush not only let noriega and the others go unpunished he opted 
to continue paying noriega 110000 annually for his cia 
liaison wrote kempe who works for the wall street journal 
even back in 1976 bush realized that paying noriega didnt 
mean buying him he wrote new intelligence in the fall linked 
noriega to a chain of three bombings aimed at american property and 
civilians 
the white house did not immediately return telephone calls for 
reaction sunday night 
the book is to be published in march by gp putnams sons

lawyers for gen manuel antonio noriega are 
rejecting the idea of a plea bargain saying they will go to trial 
if they fail to have all drug charges dismissed 
the government chose to bring general noriega to trial and 
they shall have their trial frank rubino one of several lawyers 
defending the former panamanian ruler against us indictments 
said sunday on abcs this week with david brinkley 
another lawyer steve kollin told cbs face the nation that 
prosecutors had not offered a plea bargain nor had he sought one 
general noriega is innocent of these charges kollin said 
plea bargaining takes place when somebody is guilty in my 
opinion 
president bush last week however did not rule plea bargaining 
out as an option 
and the baltimore sun reported in todays editions that the us 
government has made an offer to a codefendant of noriega as it 
seeks to bolster its case against the former panamanian strongman 
the us attorneys office has made a very preliminary offer 
to lt col luis del cid a former key panamanian defense forces 
official who surrendered to us authorities before noriega sought 
sanctuary in the vatican nuncio specifics of the offer were not 
reported 
del cid is accused of acting as liaison courier and emissary 
for noriega in his transactions with drug dealers 
plea bargains usually result in a guilty plea to lesser charges 
in exchange for information the government can use in other cases 
such action would prevent a trial and release of documents 
sensitive to national security or embarrassing to the government 
that noriegas lawyers might want for the defense 
noriegas attorneys would not say whether they had specific 
secret federal documents in mind 
the defense team here will file motions appropriate to 
receiving that information whatever information is necessary to 
represent the general properly kollin said 
rubino said the defense had been concentrating on getting the 
case dismissed and had not begun looking for evidence to clear 
noriega in a trial 
this would all be speculation as to what the government may 
have rubino said one thing i have never done in 16 years of 
practicing law is to guess what may happen 
both he and kollin said pretrial publicity has made it 
impossible for noriega to get a fair trial 
pretrial publicity is amazing in the amount rubino said 
not only the amount but the type of publicity 
the president of the united states said noriega was a thug 
and purveyor of drugs to children obviously how can someone 
strike that from their mind and give this man a fair trial 
rubino said he would argue that the case should be dismissed 
because noriega was maximum leader of panama when he was seized 
and therefore immune from us prosecution as head of state in a 
foreign country 
the intention of this administration is to make sure that mr 
noriega gets a fair trial john sununu bushs chief of staff 
said on cbs 
we ought not to do anything that creates a different category 
for the defendant once he enters the judicial system sununu said 
in response to a question about plea bargaining 
national security adviser brent scowcroft who appeared on abc 
said the administration was not worried about documents that could 
embarrass the white house and wouldnt try to block them 
he said however he didnt know if any documents existed 
relevant to the case that might harm national security 
as far as i know there arent any scowcroft said you had 
the attorney general saying he didnt anticipate any problems of 
that character i dont know whether the files have been searched 
to the ultimate 
he emphasized that the case against noriega was based on drug 
trafficking 
thats a fairly narrow part of his whole relationship with the 
united states scowcroft said 
noriega began providing intelligence information about latin 
america to the us government in the 1950s while a student at the 
military academy in peru 
questions about his drug dealing began while richard nixon was 
president and have arisen repeatedly through both republican and 
democratic administrations 
however noriegas usefulness as an intelligence source always 
appeared to overshadow the suspected drug dealing and no action was 
taken until the recent indictments

a group of episcopal bishops are seeking 
penalties against a colleague for ordaining an avowed homosexual as 
a priest 
bishop william wantland of eau claire wis said he and other 
bishops plan to formally charge newark bishop john s spong with 
violating the churchs doctrinal teachings 
a minimum of 10 bishops is needed to support a formal charge 
against a bishop wantland said he has far more than 10 
last month spong ordained gay deacon j robert williams into 
the priesthood at the all saints episcopal church in hoboken 
church traditionalists said spong violated a resolution of the 
churchs general convention that declares the ordination of a 
practicing homosexual to be inappropriate 
spong has said he considers the 1979 resolution adopted by the 
churchs governing body as advisory not church doctrine 
he noted that the resolution had been opposed by 20 bishops 
including presiding bishop edmond l browning 
in response to the planned charges spong said he welcomed any 
inquiry into his actions

eastern european governments trying to move 
from communist economies are turning for guidance to a pair of 
worldwide bodies based in washington 
they are the world bank and the international monetary fund 
both owned by 152 countries that have many different mixes of 
public and private ownership the united states takes a leading 
role in both organizations 
a senior imf official said last week that the fund is in contact 
with all the major eastern european countries 
the soviet union has said it wants to join but the united 
states has opposed that saying the country is far from a market 
economy poland and hungary are already members the new 
czechoslovak government says it would like to be 
managing director michel camdessus of france put the final 
touches to an accord with poland that has brought decontrol of 
prices a convertible currency and other measures the fund

eastern european governments have fallen in 
love with free markets but at least one free market doesnt love 
them 
the more democratic governments that have taken over from the 
hardline communists in eastern europe are still liable for the 
debts incurred primarily during the 1970s when western bankers 
thought the soviet bloc was a good credit risk 
but there is waning hope among western financial dealers that 
the loans will ever be paid in full even as western governments 
are seeking ways to support the democracy movement so that western 
bankers and businesses will invest in eastern europe 
western bankers fear the new eastern european governments will 
set their sights more on internal development programs and less on 
paying off old debts 
the old debts of poland and some other eastern european 
countries are bought on the socalled secondary market by 
speculators who want to collect the interest still paid on them by 
the borrowers 
speculators also hope that they can sell the debt at a higher 
price or that some day the debtor government will pay in full 
polish debt was selling in july for as much as 41 cents on the 
dollar of the debts original value but friday polish debt was 
selling at just 175 cents on the dollar and the debts of hungary 
and bulgaria have started to show signs of weakness

the trial of an ivy league student accused 
of crippling thousands of computer systems nationwide is viewed by 
computer security experts as a chance to garner support for tougher 
antihacker laws 
its a nolose situation because the trial will showcase the 
weaknesses of computer security and current computer security 
law said harold highland professor emeritus of computer science 
for the state university of new york and editor of computers amp 
security a trade journal 
jury selection was to begin today in the first criminal trial 
under the 1986 federal computer fraud and abuse act 
robert t morris jr a 24yearold suspended cornell university 
graduate student is accused of designing and setting loose a 
computer worm that reproduced wildly in november 1988 
the worm immobilized an estimated 6000 computers linked to a 
research network including computers at the national aeronautics 
and space administration facility at moffet field calif and the 
air force logistics command at wright patterson air force base 
ohio 
it was at cornell that authorities said morris gained access to 
the department of defense network that connects thousands of 
computers at military facilities corporate research centers and 
universities 
a cornell commission concluded that morris was guilty of 
reckless disregard for creating the program although the 
university commission found him responsible morris has never 
admitted creating the program or introducing it into the system 
morris of arnold md faces up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine if convicted 
with arguments expected to begin later this week in us 
district court computer security experts say the trial will focus 
attention on the need for more stringent computer tampering 
legislation 
if the government loses computer security advocates will 
say there is a need for stronger laws if the government wins 
theyll say he did it because the system is weak and we need to 
tighten up the system highland said 
either way it goes the pure attention is going to fuel the 
cry for tougher laws and better security said christopher a 
breceda a top officer with american computer security industries 
inc a nashville tennbased maker of security systems with 
worldwide sales 
eugene spafford an associate professor of computer science at 
purdue university who has written about the case and is expected to 
be a government witness said losses from computer crimes in the 
united states total about 7 billion annually 
ten years ago these kinds of things didnt hurt anybody but 
you have to realize now all the places where computers are used and 
the dangers involved in shutting down a system or damaging data 
he said 
the worm allegedly created by morris did not destroy any data 
and prosecutors have not estimated the monetary damage from the 
worm but spafford estimated the oneday paralysis cost between 5 
million and 15 million in lost time and in later protective work

revolutionary changes sweeping eastern 
europe have professors and textbook publishers scratching their 
heads about keeping up with history in the making 
its a mindboggling world for soviet bloc specialists said 
sovietologist ben eklof of indiana university 
and its very stressful he said ive begun to wish 
everyone over there would play baseball for a month or so and give 
me some time to rethink things 
the campus confusion started as soviet bloc governments began 
toppling in last fall college syllabuses had to be tossed out and 
curricula overhauled 
some of my colleagues are waiting for things to settle down 
but they might as well give up waiting because i dont think that 
will happen for another generation said adam ulam who directs 
harvard universitys russian research center 
its exciting and tiring at the same time said henry 
krisch an author and professor at the university of connecticut 
its as though someone in history has hit fast forward and 
processes that normally take a long time are seen in a short 
period 
independent political journals and newspapers have blossomed in 
eastern europe artists and theorists are speaking out scholarly 
exchange and travel opportunities are opening 
in many cases us professors have opted to use newspapers and 
freeform classroom debate on current events instead of the 
standard and now outdated texts 
right now im in a quandary as to whether to offer my course 
again next fall because im not sure if anything of a permanent 
published nature will be available said edwin gere a professor 
at the university of massachusetts at amherst 
publishers have similar problems the books from which 
generations of high school and college students learned about the 
soviet bloc suddenly need daily revision 
the academic headaches are reflected in the publishers 
office said frederick praeger editorial director at westview 
press inc 
you cannot publish books that deal with the current situation 
in the soviet union or eastern europe because it changes just about 
every day praeger said from his boulder colo office on the 
day you publish the book is out of date 
sam gesumaria a vice president at macmillanmcgrawhills 
school division said editors in his new york office had updated 
various social studies texts repeatedly since november 
all textbook publishers are faced with the same problem right 
now he said the best we can do is give some sort of 
information about these changes but we have to stop short of being 
conclusive because these events arent done yet and we have a long 
way to go yet i suspect 
the warsaw pacts transformation may continue for years but 
textbook publishers need to deal with an immediate bottom line 
theyve got to find a way to keep up with the change if they want 
to keep selling books 
eileen peters vice president of scott foreman and cos 
international division said several publishing houses were 
considering supplements for college survey texts 
professors can change their reading lists from semester to 
semester she said from her office in chicago its critical to 
have the books up to date because professors are going to go with 
the book that has these changes in it 
robert v daniels an author and retired university of vermont 
professor said some of the scholars working on specialized texts 
have been tempted to sit back and wait for the events to unfold 
but he rejected the practice 
thats ivory tower thinking the author of is russia 
reformable said we cant be concerned that current events 
will spoil our neat conclusions more than ever we need analyses of 
where we are

a spokesman for the eritrean rebels has 
claimed responsibility for attacks on two polish ships in the red 
sea and says any ship carrying weapons to ethiopia through the sea 
will be subject to eritrean fire 
we were sure that one of the two polish ships was carrying 
arms to ethiopia the eritrean liberation front spokesman 
reached by telephone in another persian gulf state said sunday 
he said the eritrean forces who have been waging a threedecade 
war for their regions independence from ethiopia fully back 
freedom of navigation in the red sea 
but this does not mean that ships carrying arms to ethiopia will 
be allowed to use the waterway especially those coming from 
israel said the spokesman speaking on condition his name not be 
used 
forces hostile to ethiopia including the sudanese government 
have charged that israel is bolstering ethiopia militarily with the 
aim of undermining the regional arab nations 
shipping sources who also spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the polish motor vessel adam asnyk came under fire from red sea 
shores on thursday it had come upon another polish ship boleslaw 
krzywousty stranded and ablaze 50 miles from massawa on the 
eritrean coast 
the israeli presence in ethiopia is a source of grave danger 
to the eritrean revolution and so we will not hesitate to attack 
any israeli ship carrying weapons to addis ababa government said 
the source 
he said that with the sovietethiopian friendship treaty 
expiring this year israel will become the main supplier of 
weapons ammunition and military advisers to ethiopia 
the israelis have replaced the soviet and cuban military 
advisers and experts he added 
the source also threatened the international companies who 
signed a 70 million contract with ethiopia to expand the port of

the leaning tower whose tilt draws hundreds 
of thousands of tourists a year but could also spell its downfall 
has shut its doors for repairs that officials say could take years 
thousands of sightseers climbed the stairs of the 800yearold 
tower sunday before mayor giacomino granchi locked the doors and 
expressed hope the marble wonder can be reopened soon he 
reluctantly signed an order in december authorizing the closure for 
three months 
but public works minister giovanni prandini who led the drive 
to close the tower told a nationwide television audience he 
expected the tower needed to be closed for several years 
it needs an urgent intervention prandini said but conceded 
there is no agreement yet on the best project to stabilize the 
tower which is a national symbol 
the 180foot tower begun by bonnano pisano in 1173 started to 
tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath the 
tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular 
technicians have said the tower shifted less last year than its 
average annual tilt of the last three decades 003 inches 
compared to an average 0045 inches some experts say the tower 
should stand at least a hundred more years 
the tower is an important source of income for pisa attracting 
about 800000 tourists a year paying 280 apiece to climb the 
spiral staircase 
several thousand tourists turned out sunday with an italian 
soldier the last to go up the 293 steps before the closing 
broadcast by governmentrun raitv 
the tower is an important asset which belongs to everybody 
including the international community we must keep this in mind 
said the mayor 
we have decided to close the tower for three months to do what 
has to be done i dont think it will topple soon and should never 
close i ask the minister to take his responsibility 
prandini interviewed in the rai studios pledged that a project 
will be selected by the end of this year but when asked when the 
tower would reopen replied we are talking about a few years 
i can promise that i will do all i can to hasten the 
reopening 
one plan which has been wellreceived by government experts 
calls for a wheelshaped support to be planted around the base of 
the tower the support would be connected by concrete spokes to the 
marble foundation 
the public works ministry is awaiting a report on soil 
conditions to decide whether the plan is feasible 
experts agree the tower must retain its famed lean and not be 
straightened

the army today rounded up more than 100 
palestinians suspected of belonging to ploled strike forces 
and demolished or sealed six homes during the night officials said 
the arrests were made in sweeps of arab villages near ramallah 
in the occupied west bank and the military said the detainees 
belonged to a terrorist organization recently uncovered in the area 
some of the suspects belonged to strike forces organized by 
yasser arafats mainstream fatah wing of the palestine liberation 
organization an army official said 
the strike forces are underground groups that enforce orders of 
the plolinked underground leadership of the palestinian uprising 
military officials said the group was responsible for the oct 7 
killing of a palestinian in the west bank village of deir alsudan 
who allegedly assisted israeli authorities 
they were also suspected of stabbing and wounding two other 
alleged collaborators and of torching and firebombing arabowned 
cars as punishment for helping israel said the officials who are 
not identified in accordance with army regulations 
four houses of alleged strike force members in the ramallah area 
were sealed during the night the officials said 
the army defends its policy of house demolitions and sealings by 
saying it serves as a strong deterrent against future unrest but 
it has been criticized by the us government and human rights 
groups in israel and abroad as collective punishment 
a study released dec 20 by the tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies disupted army claims that house 
demolitions reduced violence it found that in many cases such 
measures inflamed the situation 
at least 245 houses have been demolished and 120 sealed since 
the uprising began 25 months ago according to army figures 
palestinian activists have killed 166 palestinians most for 
alleged collaboration during the uprising against israeli rule of 
the west bank and gaza strip seized in the 1967 middle east war 
at least 646 palestinians have been killed by israeli gunfire in 
the uprising and 43 israelis have been slain

in a memorable role as the crusty american correspondent jackson 
bentley in lawrence of arabia bentley delivered an 
offthecuff eulogy for te lawrence saying he was a poet a 
scholar and a mighty warrior he was also the most shameless 
exhibitionist since barnum and bailey

attended the carnegie institute of technology and was brought to 
the attention of hollywood producers by cagney who had seen him 
perform on stage in los angeles

came to mind 
kennedy added that he had no great admiration for the current 
crop of actors either although his daughter laurie works as an

careers

the papal nuncio in panama said gen manuel antonio 
noriega threatened to start a massacre unless granted refuge in the 
vatican embassy in that countrys capital an italian newspaper 
reported 
the envoy monsignor jose sabastian laboa was quoted in romes 
il tempo on sunday as saying he didnt have time to consult the 
vatican and made the decision by himself 
i received two phone calls and he noriega also sent an 
officer with a message laboa was quoted as saying he gave me 
a quarter of an hour to decide accept him or he would immediately 
start a guerrilla war in the chiriqui region he threatened 
massacres 
he said he immediately informed gen marc cisneros of the us 
southern command he was speechless for them it was a 
humiliation 
in other interviews with italian reporters the nuncio said 
eliecer gaitan noriegas personal security chief provided 
decisive help in persuading noriega to leave the vatican embassy 
and surrender to us troops 
laboa said gaitan told noriega he was ready to die with him but 
by holding out they risked the same fate as mussolini because us 
troops wouldnt stop panamanians who gaitan said would one day 
storm the embassy 
mussolini was shot and killed and then hanged by his feet in a 
public square 
laboa has insisted that noriega left the embassy on his own 
accord on wednesday and previously denied reports that he gave 
noriega an ultimatum to leave the mission 10 days after seeking 
refuge there 
laboa said there was never any talk of granting concessions and 
that once it was made clear that noriega would not be sent to 
another country it came down to getting him to accept guarantees 
such as not facing the death penalty in the united states 
he knows panamanian prisons while i told him those in america 
have tv and air conditioning the nuncio was quoted as saying in 
turins la stampa and other newspapers

has been charged with making a false bomb threat that disrupted 
travel plans for hundreds of delta air lines passengers last week 
colin goodwin 17 of dunshaughlin in county meath was formally 
charged sunday in a district court he was released on 1400 bail 
and ordered to surrender his passport pending a further appearance 
in court feb 2 
detective sgt daniel oriordan said that when the charge was 
read over to goodwin the teenager replied thats right i made 
that call 
delta said it intensified security after receiving a threat 
thursday against its transatlantic operations which include 
flights to and from germany ireland england and france 
passengers were notified about the threats when they checked in 
said delta spokesman bill berry in atlanta and several hundred 
changed flights 
we had several hundred passengers in this fourday period we 
were in change their travel plans to another carrier berry said 
he said delta averages 4000 transatlantic passengers a day but 
even the loss of a few means were really concerned

office 
a terrorist bomb explosion was blamed for the dec 21 1988 
crash of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland which killed 
270 people pan am was criticized afterward for not warning 
passengers although us embassy staffers in europe had been 
warned of threats against the airline

against a flight from paris to detroit but nothing happened

the dollar was mixed against key currencies in 
european trading this morning as dealers focused on prospects for 
the west german mark gold was weaker 
peter kane chief corporate dealer at credit suisse in london 
said the italys decision to devalue the lira by 301 percent on 
friday may reduce pressures on the european monetary system in the 
shortterm but it hasnt changed the overall picture 
we will see a gradual strengthening of the mark once again 
he predicted 
david clark deputy forex manager at commerzbank in london 
described the lire devaluation as largely a technical move that 
certainly doesnt spell the end of the mark rally 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 14452 yen up 037 yen from 
fridays 14415yen finish it opened at 14455 yen and ranged 
between 14447 yen and 14475 yen 
later in london it was quoted at 14450 yen 
the bank of japan sold some 100 million shortly after the tokyo 
market opened today and fear of further central bank intervention 
discouraged later dollar buying dealers said 
mitsui bank trader yoshitsugu hanada said the dollaryen rate 
moved little because the amounts of dollars and yen held by 
investors were in good balance after wide swings and adjustments 
following the new year holidays 
the dollar which ended 1989 trading at 14340 yen opened on 
jan 4 at 14555 yen and was pushed down to 14340 yen the next day 
following central banks intervention in europe 
but the basic sentiment for the dollar was getting stronger 
and speculative dealers were inclined to buy the us currency 
whenever it fell hanada said 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late friday 
16850 west german marks up from 16810 
15360 swiss francs down from 15365 
57475 french francs up from 57405 
19095 dutch guilders up from 19030 
125800 italian lire down from 126300 
11597 canadian dollars up from 11595 
in london the british pound traded at 16440 compared with 
16375 late friday 
gold dealers in london fixed a recommended price of 40375 an 
ounce at midmorning down from 40450 bid late friday 
in zurich the bid price was 40350 down 100 from late 
friday 
gold in hong kong closed at 40156 per ounce monday down 210 
from saturdays close

proudly planning for this summers opening of the nixon 
presidential library

syndrome hugh hewitt director of the library foundation said 
as he gazed over the library a spanishstyle building described as 
a window to nixons career 
the nixon presidential library and birthplace 30 miles 
southeast of los angeles will be the first of two presidential 
libraries to open in southern california the ronald reagan 
presidential library opens next year in simi valley 75 miles away 
the 40000plus residents of nixons hometown celebrate their 
most famous citizen with a holiday tuesday for the citys 
approximately 100 employees the city council voted in september to 
make the day a yorba linda holiday the first such local honor for 
nixon 
fifteen years have elapsed since president nixons resignation 
and history has shown the importance of his presidency 
particularly with respect to his brilliance in foreign policy 
the holiday resolution said 
the 20 million library rises prominently in the hilly community 
among homes valued to 700000 construction workers are toiling 
furiously to meet the july 19 opening 
unlike other presidential libraries the 45000squarefoot 
nixon library wont be operated with taxpayer dollars the former 
chief executive insisted on it 
the nixon library will hold another first among presidential 
libraries it is to open without presidential papers 
the federal government took custody of nixons presidential 
materials 44 million pages and 4000 hours of tape recordings 
when he tried to have some of them destroyed 
control over the papers has been in litigation for years we 
expect them eventually what we have are reproductions of the oval 
office papers we have 8000 core files hewitt said 
nixon who lives in upper saddle river nj resigned aug 9 
1974 after revelations stemming from a botched burglary at 
democratic headquarters at washingtons watergate building during 
his 1972 reelection campaign 
it wont be a museum on watergate but were not going to shy 
away from it either its part of what interests people about 
nixon said hewitt noting current world events can be traced in 
part to nixons actions in the late 1960s and early 1970s 
the library was originally planned in san clemente site of the 
western white house during the nixon presidency but plans stalled 
amid controversy over another development tied to the library 
visitors on a selfguided tour will start in the librarys 
293seat theater with a 16minute film on nixons life they will 
walk through the alger hiss chambers and see the vintage woody 
station wagon used on the campaign trail in 1950 
bronze lifesized figures of 10 world leaders occupy another 
large room also on display will be nixons vice presidential 
papers and book manuscripts exhibits on the vietnam war and 
prisoners of war nixons diplomacy with the soviet union and china

the first captured security men loyal 
to ousted president nicolae ceausescu went before military 
tribunals today accused of resisting the popular revolt that 
toppled and executed the despised dictator 
the first tribunal opened in the south transylvanian city of 
sibiu ruled until dec 22 by ceausescus son nicu 
a group of terrorists who fought against the people in the 
army faced the military court a spokesman for the revolutionary 
government said 
aurel dragos munteanu the spokesman and director of television 
told a news conference he did not know how many security men would 
face trial 
he gave no details of the exact charges in sibiu or other 
centers of heavy fighting such as bucharest and the western city of 
timisoara where the revolution began dec 17 when security forces 
massacred antigovernment protesters thousands of people were 
killed in the uprising 
the accused have no right of appeal said munteanu but media 
foreign and domestic will have access to the tribunals 
the national salvation front which has been running the country 
since ceausescu was ousted dec 22 organized the secret military 
tribunal that ordered the christmas day execution of the president 
and his wife elena 
it has since abolished the death sentence so the captured men 
of crack security units who battled the army after ceausescu was 
ousted face a maximim sentence of life in prison 
munteanu said those still under investigation include nicu 
ceausescu and gen iulian vlad the former head of ceausescus 
dreaded securitate security police which romanias new leaders 
have ordered disbanded 
asked about weekend statements from president ion iliescu and 
vice president dumitru mazilu that free elections promised for 
april could be postponed munteanu said he knew of no such 
postponement as yet 
the halfdozen political parties formed or reborn in the two 
short weeks since ceausescu was executed have charged that the 
national salvation front would have an unfair advantage in any 
early poll because of its control of media and the government 
they have urged posponement of the balloting so they have more 
time to organize campaigns 
some political groups have accused romanian television of 
boycotting their gatherings while giving ample coverage to the 
national salvation front romanian tv cameras did not follow 
demonstrations by two parties and students in bucharest on sunday 
munteanu countered these complaints by stressing he believed in 
a free media and noting that representatives of the peasant party 
and liberal party appeared on television sunday night to present 
their groups programs 
my personal standard of freedom of the press is the first 
amendment to the united states constitution he said 
after these parties had registered they were given access to 
television he said previously there was no legal framework 
for that the peasant party was a power in parliament before the 
communists abolished it in 1947 and both it and the christian 
democrats have traditionally been anticommunist 
since their renaissance the two parties have joined forces in 
preparation for the promised elections and have warned against a 
communist resurgence 
they see the national salvation front which includes several 
former communists in its leadership as a de facto front for 
communism 
on sunday about 300 supporters of the two parties led an 
emotional march through the capital in memory for those who fell in 
the uprising 
as they knelt and prayed in the bitter cold that hovered near 
zero the marchers were joined by several thousand other people who 
paced along the icecovered sidewalks in a solemn halfmile 
procession 
less than two miles away about 2500 students met for a rally 
at the polytechnical institute to press for university autonomy 
more student say in determining the curriculum and a postponement 
of examinations scheduled for jan 25 they also want an end to 
required political indoctrination courses 
nicolae costel a christian democratic party official said 
thousands more students had gathered in other cities including 
timisoara 
during ceausescus 24year reign courses that extolled the 
virtues of scientific socialism were compulsory for all 
students 
razvan rusovici a 21yearold aeronautical engineering student 
expressed hope for the future we want to be more like our 
western brothers and study what we really need and not what some 
ignorant dictator imagines we need

president bush saying productive 
agriculture and a clean environment are compatible urged americas 
farmers today to support efforts to reduce contamination of 
groundwater from pesticides and fertilizers 
in an address to the american farm bureau convention bush also 
said he will press in the 1990 farm bill for marketoriented farm 
policies that allow producers more flexibility to decide what crops 
to grow 
at the same time weve got to maintain a safety net to 
protect farmers from conditions beyond their control the 
president said in remarks prepared for delivery at the orange 
county civic center before touring hightech agriculture and ocean 
exhibits at walt disneys epcot center nearby 
bush also used the speech to push a major objective of his on 
this years congressional calendar passage of a cut in the capital 
gains tax cut he said a tax reduction would apply to the sale of 
farmland and will be one of my top priorities in this 
legislative year 
with continued economic growth we can keep rural america 
going strong he said 
bush said farmers have bounced back from trying times in the 
1980s with help from the 1985 farm legislation that led to lower 
federal crop subsidies and more land in production 
surpluses have declined dramatically and most of of good land 
has been brought back into production he said net farm income 
reached a record level last year the farm credit situation has 
greatly improved bringing more financial stability to rural 
america 
but bush added that marketoriented farm policies are only a 
part of the agricultural picture weve got to expand markets and 
enhance productivity weve got to assure the public that americas 
food is the safest in the world and weve got to protect our 
precious environment 
we must recognize that productive agriculture and a sound 
environment can be compatible especially in terms of water 
quality the president said 
the administration has already initiated a fiveyear effort to 
protect groundwater from contamination by fertilizers and 
pesticides running off farms he said 
we must keep your good land in business without unreasonable 
burdens but we must also keep it good land he said i am 
counting on your leadership as we work to expand farm productivity 
while safeguarding the environment 
without giving details bush said the administration also is 
drafting legislation to protect the food supply without 
overwhelming the agriculture industry 
he noted that farmers have a major stake in us efforts to 
foster free trade including its recent bold proposal in the 
uruguay round of international trade talks that would phase out 
exportsubsidies in five years and other tradedistorting practices 
in 10 years 
any agreement we sign will be an agreement thats also good 
for american agriculture he promised 
bush pointed to the emerging economies in eastern europe as a 
prime target for expanded farm exports us farm exports already 
are at record levels after three years of growth 
the trip was bushs first public appearance since expanamanian 
dictator manuel antonio noriega surrendered last wednesday to face 
trial in the united states on drugtrafficking charges 
it comes as us officials acknowledged they are having some 
difficulties arranging an increased role for the us military in 
the caribbean off the coast of colombia to help intercept drug 
smugglers sea and air routes 
bush asked sunday as he went jogging about reports that the 
aircraft carrier john f kennedy and other ships were steaming 
toward colombia said i will address myself to that question 
at a future date 
when a reporter suggested that colombian officials were upset 
bush said we dont know all that 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said discussions with 
colombian authorities have not begun 
however bogotas el tiempo published a communique sunday by the 
government of president virgilio barco that said the colombian 
government has not participated nor will it participate in any 
joint operation with united states military forces air or naval 
in the caribbean sea 
in international waters it has not participated nor will it 
and in territorial waters it has not authorized the operations 
nor is it considering authorizing them the statement added 
defense secretary dick cheney said sunday that he expected the 
announcement of steppedup military antidrug efforts within the 
next two week and predicted that the latin nations and anybody 
interested in halting the flow of illicit drugs into the united 
states will be supportive

in abraham lincolns day souvenirhunters and 
jobseekers roamed virtually unchecked through the white house 
night and day and even the familys pet goats had the run of the 
executive mansion a pulitzer prizewinning historian says 
david herbert donald of harvard university kept president and 
mrs bush and 125 others enraptured sunday night with his 
descriptions of the downtoearth life the lincolns led during the 
civil war 
this is the first in a series of lectures on the men whove 
held this office and it seeks to make them come alive bush told 
the audience gathered in the state dining room what were they 
like how did they live how was history the history of americas 
house molded by their dreams 
to occupy this office is to ask those questions and certainly 
to feel a kinship with those who have gone before said bush the 
41st president 
lincoln donald said came to washington in 1861 from 
springfield ill with few friends and no administrative 
experience he found himself a virtual prisoner in his own home 
besieged by jobseekers at every turn 
the kentuckyborn mary todd lincoln was regarded as an uncouth 
frontierswoman by washingtons society elite their suspicions grew 
when four of her brothers and three brothersinlaw enlisted in the 
confederate cause 
the floors of the mansions public rooms were covered in 
oilcloth to make it easier to clean up the spills from overflowing 
spittoons mrs lincoln made short work of a fouryear 
appropriation of 20000 200000 in todays dollars to fix up 
the mansion spending it in weeks and running up other bills on 
credit 
merchants showed her the best and she bought everything 
donald said lincoln fulminated but congress passed a supplemental 
appropriation to cover the debts 
the lincolns were the first family to raise children in the 
white house with their two youngest sons willie and tad ages 10 
and 8 commandeering the roof for a fort from which they fired 
on invisible rebels across the potomac 
citizens showered them with gifts including a pony and two 
goats which like the public at large had the run of the white 
house donald said 
but on feb 5 1862 even as the lincolns were host to 500 
guests to show off the restored mansion both boys lay seriously 
ill upstairs with bilious fever possibly typhoid from the 
white houses foul water supply donald said 
willie died two weeks later leaving both parents 
griefstricken lincoln recovered but his wife did not lapsing 
into a deep depression and becoming the dupe of spiritualists who 
held at least eight seances at the white house 
lincoln attended one to find out who was preying on his wifes 
mental instability donald said 
lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation in the fall of 
1862 and his republican party lost the congressional elections 
as the war went poorly lincoln ate little and slept poorly in a 
bedroom separate from his wife tad beset with nightmares often 
slept in his fathers bed 
a year after willies death the lincolns began entertaining 
again mrs lincoln continued her spendthrift ways buying jewelry 
and clothing galore including 400 pairs of gloves in a threemonth 
period she needed 19 wagons to cart her belongings to a summer 
residence 
mrs bush said after donalds lecture that she felt 
agonizingly sorry for mrs lincoln 
i hadnt known she had any happy times all our pictures of 
her are agonizingly sad she said we always think today our 
lives are so complicated then you look at what lincoln stepped 
into things look pretty good for us 
bush said he plans two more presidential lectures this year he 
did not say who will give them but noted i always love teddy 
roosevelt

communist officials began talks today 
with members of the opposition the turkish minority and slav 
majority on ethnic conflicts that erupted in a wave of nationwide 
protests last week 
the meeting at the national assembly building chaired by 
parliament president stanko todorov was called after four days of 
nationalist rallies against a decision by communist leaders 
allowing ethnic turks and moslems to use their moslem names and 
practice their religion without restrictions 
ethnic conflicts have become more apparent in some parts of 
eastern europe where hardline communist regimes were replaced by 
reformist governments last year 
the government news agency bta reported that representatives 
from all official and opposition groups as well as delegations 
from dozens of cities were taking part in the forum which the 
agency termed unprecedented in communist bulgaria 
todorov on sunday night called for the weeklong social forum 
on several aspects of the national question 
bta did not identify who was taking part in the forum it said 
the meeting today was to discuss how to organize the talks and that 
formal negotiations would begin tuesday 
however bta said the participants unanimously approved an 
appeal to the people to call off all rallies and strikes to ensure 
a peaceful and businesslike atmosphere at the talks 
at a rally sunday bulgarian demonstrators threatened to start a 
general strike if their demands were not met that a referendum be 
held on the minority issue 
news media controlled by the 2monthold leadership that 
replaced hardliner todor zhivkov reported that local officials who 
are holdovers from the old regime appeared to be using the ethnic 
issue to try to stall reform 
but the media also reported a resurgence of turkish nationalism 
in some areas quoting witnesses as saying turkish flags have been 
seen flying over public buildings in one southern city 
premier georgi atanassov said the practice was illegal 
the demonstrators demand the repeal of a dec 29 order restoring 
rights to bulgarias 15 million ethnic turks and moslems 
that decision reversed the assimilation policy introduced by 
zhivkov who forced ethnic turks to change their names to bulgarian 
ones and barred them from speaking turkish in public 
nationalists among the slav majority who are mainly orthodox 
christian fear the turkish minority is growing too fast and poses 
a threat to the country of nearly 9 million slavs also are 
suspicious of the loyalties of the bulgarian turks and ethnic 
bulgarian moslems known as pomaks since bulgaria won independence 
in 1877 from the ottoman empire which had ruled it for 500 years 
the government of turkey which lies on bulgarias southeastern 
border and some bulgarian turks have blamed zhivkovs hardline 
commmunist followers for instigating the unrest 
bulgarian foreign minister boiko dimitrov is to meet his turkish 
counterpart mesut yilmaz in kuwait tuesday for a second round of 
talks on the minority issue 
on friday thousands of bulgarian workers walked off the job in 
at least five cities other demonstrations took place over the 
weekend 
bulgaria a onenationality country read banners carried 
by some of the 10000 ethnic slavs who demonstrated in sofia on 
sunday outside alexander nevski cathedral 
standing in zerodegree weather the protesters booed hissed or 
chanted resignation resignation as atanassov and interior 
minister atanas semerdzhiev tried to address them 
in an apparent attempt to appease the protesters atanassov said 
bulgarian would remain the official language but both his and 
semerdzhievs speeches were drowned out 
a hard time will befall the country whose people is divided 
the official news agency bta quoted semerdzhiev as saying he 
appealed to the crowd not to undermine the tendencies towards 
democracy in the country 
bta said residents from the southern town of kardzhali where 
almost half the 50000 inhabitants are ethnic turks reported 
seeing turkish flags on public buildings 
atanassov in a television address sunday said it was 
inadmissible to raise the flag of a foreign state at 
demonstrations and rallies in public and private places 
he said the interior minister had been told to maintain public 
peace and neutralize any anticonstitutional and extremist acts 
under the framework of law he did not elaborate 
a leader of the influential independent trade union podkrepa 
nikolai kolev called for members to fight against all 
destructive forces in a statement broadcast on state tv he said 
he thought nationalistic protests were being spurred by local 
officials 
while petar mladenov who took over from zhivkov as party leader 
nov 10 has moved quickly to put new people in the leadership more 
likely to support democratic reform few changes have been made at 
the local level 
some 320000 ethnic turks fled zhivkovs persecution and 
emigrated to turkey last summer but at least 50000 returned 
because of a lack of jobs and proper housing 
elsewhere in eastern europe a revolt by ethnic hungarians 
against the romanian government last month turned into a nationwide 
uprising that ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu

radical students hurling firebombs 
burned effigies of us ambassador donald gregg and president roh 
taewoo today in the provincial city of kwangju to protest greggs 
visit reports said 
a separate group of 100 protesters threw human excrement and 
tear gas powder near a police station several hundred yards from 
the us cultural center residence where gregg visited the reports 
said 
about 500 radical students yelling antiamerican slogans hurled 
firebombs and rocks at 900 combatclad riot police outside the main 
gate of chosun university reported yonhap the south korean news 
agency 
two black armored vans fired volleys of tear gas shells to break 
up a campus rally but groups of students and riot police clashed 
in handtohand fighting inside the campus for more than an hour 
yonhap said no injuries or arrests were reported 
gregg apparently did not see the fighting news reports said he 
was the first us ambassador to visit kwangju a provincial city 
155 miles south of seoul since a 1980 civil uprising in which 200 
were killed and 1500 injured 
many kwangju citizens believe washington condoned the 
mobilization of the korean military to put down unrest and silence 
government dissent washington has repeatedly denied the 
allegations 
gregg came here under a scheme with roh taewoo trying to 
unilaterally shelve the kwangju issue yelled a student leader at 
the rally yonhap said 
the students vowed to continue their struggle to overthrow rohs 
government and punish the united states which they claim played a 
role in the uprising 
the hankook ilbo a seoul daily newspaper said police advised 
against greggs visit but us officials insisted that an 
explanation of the american role in kwangju should be resolved 
through dialogue 
i came here not to make an apology but to express regret and 
condolences to kwangju citizens gregg told a news conference in 
a downtown hotel according to yonhap which said he denied any 
us involvement in putting down the uprising 
gregg reportedly told journalists the united states urged the 
south korean government in 1980 to settle the protests in kwangju 
peacefully but our influence was not enough over the south 
korean government 
antiamerican sentiment in strong in kwangju and the us 
cultural center has been attacked by radical students 28 times 
since 1980 it was closed last year after us officials expressed 
concern for the safety of the staff 
gregg a former cia station chief in seoul has been the target 
of protests since he was appointed ambassador last year on oct 
13 six radical students broke into his residence and hurled 
homemade bombs at police before being overpowered gregg and his 
wife meg were unhurt 
he arrived in kwangju on sunday for a threeday stay last week 
the us embassy issued a statement rejecting former president chun 
doohwans reference to an alleged us role in the kwangju 
incident 
chun said in parliamentary testimony dec 31 that he then an 
army general decided on the military suppression of the uprising 
after receiving information from the united states that the 
military threat from communist north korea was increasing 
the us embassy said the united states did not see any evidence 
of a heightened threat from north korea at the time

scientists took samples of gritty ash 
from the flanks of mount st helens in hopes of learning whether 
the volcanos latest burst will bring more explosive activity 
three scientists got within 12 miles of the crater on the east 
flanks of the 8366foot mountain sunday to gather ash from the 
largest explosion in nearly four years 
dan dzurisin acting scientist in charge of the cascades volcano 
observatory in vancouver said the ash appeared to be pulverized 
material from previously erupted lava 
if an examination by microscope shows the ash is from a new 
surge of magma or molten rock beneath the volcano however it 
could be a sign of more explosions to come dzurisin said 
scientists also planned to fly in a helicopter over the crater 
to determine whether there was an avalanche from the lava dome in 
the eruption saturday morning dense clouds prevented a flight 
sunday dzurisin said 
the latest eruption which came without preceding earthquakes 
sent ash as far as 90 miles to the east and destroyed two 
seismometers and two tilt meters in the crater no injuries were 
reported 
seismographs and other equipment recorded the twominute 
explosion beginning at 537 am saturday after a couple of hours 
of small earthquakes beneath the volcano seismic activity subsided 
to normal levels dzurisin said 
in the past few months there have twice been lesser bursts from 
the volcano on aug 24 there was a minor eruption with no ashfall 
detected on dec 8 ashfall was limited to the crater 
an eruption like saturdays without the small earthquakes in 
advance to give a warning is relatively new to us dzurisin 
said 
it was the most significant explosion since a series of small 
explosions spit ash in the spring of 1986 he said 
us forest service and wapato police officials received dozens 
of calls saturday reporting light dustings of a fine gritty 
graywhite ash in and around yakima in the southcentral part of 
the state yakima is about 80 miles from the volcano 
the volcanos last significantly large eruption was on march 19 
1982 when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork 
of the toutle river he said 
the last domebuilding eruption a more quiet process in which 
molten rock pushes upward to swell the huge mound of cooling lava 
in the crater was in 1986 
studying the recent ashfall could indicate whether the eruption 
was part of a last gasp or the start of a more explosive phase 
in the volcanic activity that began in march 1980 dzurisin said 
the cataclysmic explosion of may 18 1980 leveled 230 square 
miles killed 57 people and sent up an ash cloud that circled the 
globe it also blew off the top 1300 feet of the peak

opposition groups today questioned assurances 
by communist leaders that east germanys secret police is being 
disbanded and alleged that one unit had urged a coup to stop 
democratic reforms 
the opposition group democratic awakening today said opposition 
representatives were suspending talks on east germanys future with 
the government until officials explain the domestic security 
situation todays talks were covered on national television 
a collapse of the talks could endanger the tenuous acceptance of 
communist premier hans modrows transitional cabinet by the 
opposition which has been unable to present a unified front 
opposition groups earlier had threatened to leave the talks over 
what they charge are government efforts to preserve a domestic 
intelligence network that could stifle the reform movement 
rolf henrich of new forum the largest opposition group 
disclosed what he said was a draft telex prepared by secret police 
agents in the city of gera on dec 9 urging authorities in east 
berlin to paralyze the opposition 
henrich said he was uncertain if the telex was ever dispatched 
but contended it called for a coup to end the democratic reform 
movement 
communist party chief gregor gysi and representatives of other 
traditionally communistallied parties said they were unaware of 
the message 
democratic awakening leader wolfgang schnur demanded that the 
national prosecutors office and the interior ministry appear 
before representatives of the opposition and government later in 
the afternoon 
the modrow government formed after a peaceful popular october 
revolution toppled hardline communist leaders has promised to 
create the conditions for free and fair elections on may 6 
as talks resumed today the opposition demanded that the 
government disarm agents of the former state security office by 
jan 19 and drop plans to set up a new agency to succeed it before 
the may elections 
peter koch an official named by the government to oversee 
dissolution of the secret police said authorities plan to 
confiscate all of the former agencys arms by the end of this 
month former agents are already barred from access to weapons he 
said 
reports last month by the official adn news agency said the 
force had been disbanded 
modrow said in an interview sunday with austrian television that 
a security force is needed to prevent the spread of rightwing 
extremism in east germany 
in todays session some opposition leaders lashed out at 
communist authorities for allegedly trying to portray them as 
rightwingers 
markus meckel a delegate of the opposition social democratic 
party said recent government warnings about a rise of neonazism 
is aimed at justifying authorities desire to preserve the secret 
police 
the negotiations launched dec 7 includes some 40 delegates 
from the communists other political parties long aligned with them 
but now independent and the prodemocracy opposition 
the communist party has given up its constitutional monopoly on 
power and has been tarnished by corruption charges against previous 
communist leaders 
but the opposition has been hardpressed to offer a credible 
alternative to continued communist rule 
preelection unity announced by six east german reform movements 
proved shortlived sunday with one group announcing it has 
abandoned the coalition and new forum saying it prefers to run 
candidates independently 
the united left proreform group has withdrawn from the 
oppositions election alliance 90 coalition announced on thursday 
adn reported 
bernd gehrkes of united left was quoted by adn as saying that 
his group was misleadingly presented in the announcement by the 
social democrats another of the prodemocracy groups that six 
movements were banding together to boost their election chances 
social democratic leader steffen reiche said three days earlier 
that his party had joined with new forum democratic awakening 
democracy now the initiative for peace and human rights and the 
united left 
but at a weekend congress in leipzig 150 delegates from new 
forum branches around the country declared that election of 
individual independent candidates was preferable to voting for 
political parties or alliances and that new forum candidates would 
rather run alone 
dozens of citizens groups pressing for social political 
environmental and economic reforms have sprung up throughout east 
germany since the oct 18 ouster of hardline communist leader 
erich honecker and the nations turn toward democracy and open 
borders

last months coup attempt was staged 
by more troops than previously thought and some senior officers 
believed most of the armed forces were involved in the plot 
according to documents obtained today 
the assessments were contained in sworn affidavits made to 
military investigators probing the bloody dec 19 attempt to 
topple president corazon aquino the associated press obtained 
copies of the statements from military sources 
in one affidavit a rebel army captain who later defected to the 
government said coup plotters had expected priests nuns 
government officials and civilians to join mutinous soldiers 
repeating the 1986 peoples power revolt that ousted the late 
ruler ferdinand marcos 
capt jose cruz assistant chief of staff of logistics for the 
philippine military said the failed coup that officials said left 
113 dead was launched to combat alleged corruption nepotism and 
inefficiency 
cruz and seven other military officers affirmed their statements 
friday before a government panel investigating whether to file 
rebellion charges against two retired brigadier generals implicated 
in the failed putsch 
brig gen oscar florendo chief of the civil relations service 
said a major enlisted mens fraternity has been linked to the coup 
attempt and tried to assassinate him and other military officials 
the philippines news agency reported today 
florendo quoting two captured rebel soldiers said the guardian 
brotherhood was involved in the coup attempt guardian members have 
been linked to a previous coup attempt 
mrs aquino has also created a presidential commission to 
investigate the coup attempt arming it with emergency powers to 
open bank accounts of suspected plotters 
at least five flag officers four of them at large were 
identified by the military as having joined the attempt at least 
20 officers whose names had not been previously linked to other 
rebellions are being investigated for their role in the coup 
attempt 
col abraham paray commanding officer of the light armored 
brigade said he tried to dissuade rebel officers from using 
violence when they seized the army headquarters on the first day 
paray said he asked the mutineers who were orchestrating their 
actions and was told that most in the military hierarchy was 
involved except secretary of national defense fidel ramos chief of 
staff gen renato de villa and constabulary chief maj gen ramon 
montano 
he said the rebels identified military backers including the 
commander of the elite scout rangers brig gen marcelo blando 
who is is hiding and the chief of the southern luzon command 
brig gen alejandro galido galido has not been charged but was 
sent on leave for alleged health problems he denied any role in 
the coup attempt 
but considering the big names that they dropped i gathered 
the impression that the majority of the armed forces of the 
philippines had a hand in the takeover said paray who was among 
those held captive at the officers lounge at army headquarters 
fort bonifacio 
in another affidavit cruz who was also implicated but 
acquitted in the august 1987 failed coup said most scout ranger 
companies joined the mutiny including those from southern and 
central luzon island the specific units he cited had not been 
previously linked to the coup attempt 
cruz said he had attended secret meetings since october with 
plotters led by a maj abraham purugganan at the army headquarters 
a briefing was held on the eve of the mutiny and final instructions 
made 
it was also explained to us that on the morning of dec 1 when 
the major services have already occupied their respective areas 
the representatives of these major services will converge at the 
philippine army headquarters to be joined and attended by 
government officials politicians media causeoriented groups 
priests and nuns and others cruz said 
he said a junta was to then convene adding that identities of 
politicians or members of the junta were not mentioned 
cruz said he decided to defect on the first night and escaped on 
foot during a power failure in the camp

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that people have no constitutionally protected right to privacy 
when at home speaking on a cordless telephone 
the court without comment turned away arguments that law 
enforcement agents acted unlawfully when without obtaining a court 
warrant they monitored an iowa familys cordlesstelephone 
conversations 
noting that the technology of cordless phones makes 
conversations on them more susceptible to interception a federal 
judge said because there was no justifiable expectation of 
privacy the interceptions did not violate the fourth amendment 
the constitutions fourth amendment generally bars warrantless 
police searches and seizures and since a landmark 1967 supreme 
court decision police have been barred from secretly listening to 
conversations over traditional phones without court warrants 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling 
in the iowa case last june 15 making it binding law in seven 
states iowa arkansas minnesota missouri nebraska north 
dakota and south dakota 
todays supreme court action does not carry any direct impact on 
any state aside from those seven 
one of every four american homes has a cordless phone according 
to industry estimates over nine million of the phones were sold in 
1989 
the cordless phone relays a speakers voice from a mobile 
handset to a base unit through the use of lowpower radio 
transmissions from the base unit the signal is transmitted 
through regular telephone lines 
the phone can be used anywhere within a certain distance from 
the base unit usually a range of up to 700 feet conversations on 
it however may be heard by another cordless phone nearby and on 
the same frequency 
scott and sheila tyler of dixon iowa received a cordless phone 
as a gift in june 1983 it was regularly used by the tylers and 
their children as another extension phone 
neighbors rich and sandra berodt who lived several blocks away 
soon discovered that their cordless phone would make ringing and 
dialing noises whenever the tyler phone was in use 
based on some conversations they listened to the berodts 
suspected that scott tyler was involved in illegal drug dealing 
they contacted everett howard an investigator with the scott 
county sheriffs department 
howard encouraged the berodts to continue the eavesdropping and 
supplied them with recording equipment so conversations on the 
tylers phone could be preserved on cassettes 
the berodts suspicion about drugdealing proved unfounded but 
over several months authorities relied on the tapes to charge scott 
tyler with criminal theft and conspiracy the tapes however were 
barred as evidence at his criminal trial 
tyler was convicted in late 1984 on charges stemming from his 
bilking two food companies out of 35000 he was sentenced to 10 
years in prison but was released after serving 123 days 
tyler and his family later sued the berodts scott county 
sheriff forest ashcraft and sheriffs investigator howard in 
federal court 
the lawsuit contended that the warrantless monitoring of the 
tyler cordless phone violated the familys fourth amendment privacy 
rights 
us district judge harold d vietor in davenport threw out the 
suit and the dismissal was upheld by the 8th circuit court 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the tylers said the 
technological differences between a cordless phone and a 
traditional phone are not enough to remove all fourth amendment 
protection for the daily communications of millions of people 
americans justifiably expect privacy in their residential 
phone conversations the appeal said that expectation is not 
based on faith in technology but on faith in our constitutional 
system 
the case is tyler vs berodt 89691

afghan rebels today claimed they 
killed 200 communist soldiers and repulsed hundreds more in a 
monthlong government assault on guerrilla positions in northwestern 
afghanistan 
the official rebel information agency midia said 70 rebels died 
in the fighting which also destroyed scores of homes in the 
district of shireen tagab about 75 miles south of afghanistans 
border with the soviet union

bombing and shelling by government troops 
meanwhile midia said moscow sent two mig29 aircraft reportedly 
the latest in the soviet fleet of fighter jets to afghanistan 
along with a group of soviet pilots like most reports from both 
the rebels and the afghan government its authenticity could not be 
independently verified 
the pilots have been stationed in central afghanistans bagram 
airforce base the countrys largest midia said 
usbacked guerrilla fighters based in pakistan have been 
fighting for more than 11 years to topple successive communist 
governments in afghanistan until a year ago more than 103000

the supreme court today rejected the appeal of 
a tennessee high school student pulled from a race for student 
council president after giving a speech officials deemed 
disrespectful 
the court without comment let stand rulings that officials at 
unicoi county high in erwin tenn did not violate dean polings 
freespeech rights 
poling was a junior running for student council president when 
in may 1987 he delivered a school assembly campaign speech critical 
of the schools administration 
if you want to break the iron grip of this school vote for me 
for president poling told the assembly audience 
he also singled out the schools assistant principal in charge 
of discipline for criticism the admninistration plays tricks 
with your mind and they hope you wont notice for example why 
does mr davidson stutter while he is on the intercom he doesnt 
have a speech impediment poling said 
because of the speech school principal ellis murphy 
disqualified poling from the student council presidency race he 
later was elected president of his senior class 
murphy said polings speech had a disruptive effect on the 
school administrations authority and had shown insensitivity and 
bad taste in its remarks about the assistant principal 
polings parents sued school officials and the school board in 
their sons behalf seeking 300000 in damages for an asserted 
violation of his freespeech rights 
a federal judge threw out the suit without a trial and the 6th 
us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal by a 21 vote 
last april 18 
for all we know there may in fact have been an overreaction 
by school authorities the appeals court said but a federal 
court is obviously not the ideal body to try to answer such a 
question 
it added dean poling appears to be an intelligent and 
imaginative young man and probably no more anarchistic than many 
of his teachers at his age like most teenagers dean doubtless 
feels embarrassment very keenly but he may not fully have 
appreciated that the assistant principals of this world are 
sentient beings also some of whom may even be capable of 
experiencing embarrassment themselves 
in a dissenting opinion judge gilbert merritt said polings 
remarks amounted to political speech pure and simple and that 
the action taken against him was unconstitutional 
in a landmark 1969 ruling the supreme court said high school 
students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of 
speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate and ruled that 
officials wrongly had banned the wearing of antiwar armbands 
but the court in 1986 gave school administrators broad 
disciplinary powers that include suspending students who use vulgar 
language 
and in 1988 the justices gave school officials new authority to 
censor student newspapers and other forms of student expression at 
schoolsponsored events 
in the appeal acted on today poling said the test for whether 
student speech is constitutionally protected is not rudeness or 
impoliteness but disruption and disorder the appeal said 
polings 1987 speech was not disruptive and caused no disorder 
school officials urged that polings appeal be rejected they 
said that his speech unlike the wearing of an antiwar armband 
did not just happen to occur on school grounds but was part of a 
schoolsponsored activity 
the case is poling vs murphy 89678

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
94 million award won and then lost by the family of a woman 
whose husband hired her killer through an ad in soldier of fortune 
magazine 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that threw out a muchpublicized jury verdict against the 
magazine 
although the case had been viewed as one testing the scope of 
freespeech and freepress rights the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals did not invoke those constitutional issues in its ruling 
last august 
instead the appeals court relied on texas liability law 
soldier of fortune owed no duty to refrain from publishing a 
facially innocuous classified advertisement when the ads content 
at most made its message ambiguous the appeals court ruled 
the august decision overturned the 94 million award won in a 
wrongfuldeath lawsuit filed by the son and mother of sandra black 
who was killed in her bryan texas home in 1985 
mrs blacks husband robert hired john wayne hearn for 10000 
to kill her after seeing his ad in a 1984 issue of the magazine 
the ad described hearn as an exmarine and weapons specialist 
available for high risk assignments in this country or overseas 
black was convicted and sentenced to death for arranging his 
wifes murder he is a prisoner on texas death row hearn also 
convicted of two contract killings in florida is serving three 
life sentences in a florida prison 
a federal jury in houston ruled that soldier of fortune based 
in boulder colo and aimed at adventurers and military 
enthusiasts had negligently contributed to mrs blacks killing 
the jury awarded mrs blacks son gary and her mother 
marjorie eimann 19 million in compensatory damages and 75 
million in punitive damages 
but the 5th circuit court said without a more specific 
indication of illegal intent than hearns ad or its context 
provided the magazine did not violate the required standard 
of conduct by publishing an ad that later played a role in criminal 
activity 
after last augusts ruling e barrett prettyman jr a lawyer 
for soldier of fortune publisher robert brown said the jurys 
verdict would not only have put the magazine out of business but 
would have had an extraordinarily harmful effect on magazines and 
publishers of all kinds 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for mrs blacks son and 
mother said the appeals court actually relied on the constitutions 
freespeech protections not texas law in ruling for the magazine 
regardless of the label the court applies to its reasoning it 
appears that the first amendment was the principal inspiration for 
its ruling the appeal contended it said hearns ad was not 
entitled to such protection because it was commercial speech 
related to illegal activity 
the case is eimann vs soldier of fortune 89790

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
dispute over how much welfare aid some needy families are entitled 
to receive 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal aimed 
at limiting the payments in a virginia case 
at issue are features of the aid to families with dependent 
children afdc program 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last march ruled partly in 
favor of welfare officials and partly in favor of afdc recipients 
the appeals court said social security benefits paid to any 
child in a household must be considered in determining eligibility 
for afdc payments to the family that has the effect of reducing 
afdc payments 
virginia families participating in the program said the us 
department of health and human services in restricting afdc 
benefits misinterpreted a 1984 budgetcutting law 
the 4th circuit court also ruled that the first 50 a month 
families receive in social security benefits must be disregarded 
when determining afdc payments 
the bush administration asked the justices to overturn that part 
of the appeals court decision a separate appeal filed in behalf of 
the virginia families involved in the case was not acted on today 
justice department lawyers said the 50disregard provision 
enacted by congress in 1974 applies only to child support payments 
made by an absent parent and not to social security benefits paid 
to a child of a deceased or disabled parent 
the 4th circuit court disagreed 
we perceive no distinction between support derived directly 
from a fathers wages and support provided indirectly through 
social security the appeals court said the money to support the 
child comes directly through the father or indirectly through 
insurance he earned when working 
government lawyers said if the appeals courts view of the 
50disregard provision were adopted nationwide states and the 
federal government would have to pump 44 million more each year 
into the afdc program 
the 4th circuit courts ruling is binding law in virginia west 
virginia maryland north carolina and south carolina 
the government appeal noted that the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals has issued a ruling that conflicts with the 4th circuit 
court decision 
the case acted on today is sullivan vs stroop 89535

opposition leaders considering a 
merger of two political parties met today with their lawmakers in 
efforts to convince them that the new alliance could curtail 
opposition infighting 
the republican democratic party and the new democratic 
republican party the nations second and thirdlargest opposition 
parties have agreed in principle to form a new political party by 
merging forces for midyear local elections the first such 
elections in south korea in three decades 
the combined party then could outshadow the current leading 
opposition group the party for peace and democracy and 
potentially offer a forceful challenge to the governing party 
kim youngsam leader of the republican democrats today said 
the merger must be completed by march after prudently collecting 
opinions within and outside the party 
kim jongpil head of the smallest opposition party told a 
caucus of his lawmakers that the goal is to shift to a better 
political system which can operate better in the long run 
kim jongpil is related by marriage to former president park 
chunghee and served as prime minister in the early 1970s he also 
was the organizer and first director of the national security 
agency formerly called the kcia 
some lawmakers said they would boycott a move to join with kim 
jongpils party because they did not want to be associated with 
past authoritarian regimes and instead would form an independent 
voting bloc in parliament 
south korea has four political parties and most politicians 
regard the system as unworkable repeated efforts among party 
leaders to compromise have failed 
in the 1987 presidential elections opposition votes were split 
by two main opposition parties helping governing party candidate 
roh taewoo win by a narrow margin the opposition leaders were 
blamed by some for ignoring popular demand for a united opposition 
candidate 
dissidents and radicals claiming their views are not 
represented by the four major political parties have announced 
plans to organize a progressive political party supported by 
workers farmers and the poor

the supreme court today agreed to take a fresh 
look at whether labor unions may be sued in state courts for 
alleged failure to assure safe conditions for workers 
the court said it will decide whether the united steelworkers of 
america may be sued for alleged negligence in a 1972 idaho silver 
mine disaster that killed 91 people 
the disaster occurred may 2 1972 at the sunshine mine in 
kellogg the us bureau of mines said an underground fire 
apparently started when timbers and debris ignited spontaneously 
the 91 miners died of asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning 
families of dead miners sued the union alleging that a safety 
committee member appointed by the union had failed during monthly 
inspections to point out or correct such problems as corroded 
oxygenbreathing equipment and padlocked rescue equipment 
the idaho supreme court ruled in 1986 that the union could be 
sued in state court 
but the justices told the state court to reconsider its ruling 
after they in 1987 gave unions new protection against such state 
court suits 
the 1987 ruling said such suits generally are preempted by 
federal labor law the justices stressed the need for 50state 
uniformity in interpreting requirements of collective bargaining 
agreements 
but the idaho supreme court in reconsidering the sunshine mine 
case said the negligence claims were different because a union 
member was on the inspection team 
the suit against the united steelworkers does not depend upon 
any interpretation of the unions collective bargaining agreement 
with the mine owners the state court said 
we are not faced with looking at the collective bargaining 
agreement to determine whether it imposes some new duty upon the 
union the state court said rather it is conceded the union 
undertook to inspect and thus the issue is solely whether that 
inspection was negligently performed under traditional idaho 
personal injury law 
the state court relied heavily on a 1988 supreme court ruling 
that reinstated a suit against a union by a woman who said she was 
fired improperly the justices in that case said unions may be sued 
for violating state laws as long as courts can decide the suit 
without interpreting collective bargaining agreements 
the case acted on today is united steelworkers vs rawson

the supreme court today allowed states to 
impose on airlines a tax partially based on flight time over the 
states 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to an oregon 
tax described by two airlines as a toll booth in the sky 
lawyers for alaska airlines and usair said oregon has erected 
a toll booth at 35000 feet for interstate airplanes wishing to 
pass over the state 
the formula for calculating an airlines property taxes includes 
the time an aircraft spends in the air over oregon even if the 
plane does not land or take off from there 
the two airlines said the tax for such flights almost doubles 
the amount they owe oregon each year alaska airlines said it 
amounted to an extra 750000 for 1988 
the oregon supreme court upheld the levy last february 
the state court said the tax is not an assessment on 
overflights more precisely the formula reflected that portion 
of time that each airlines aircraft property spent on the ground 
or in the air in oregon it said 
the state court also said there is an adequate connection 
between the tax and the benefits opportunities and protection 
conferred or afforded the airlines by the state the tax need 
not be assessed only as compensation for services provided it 
added 
the us supreme court justices since 1977 has allowed states to 
tax interstate business if the levy is fairly apportioned does 
not discriminate against interstate commerce and is fairly related 
to services which the state provides to the taxpayer 
alaska airlines and usair argued that oregon provides no 
services for overflights 
any monitoring of such flights is done by the federal 
government the airlines said any help the states might give for 
emergency landings is compensated by a part of the property tax 
assessed against schedued landings and departures they added 
both airlines have flights in and out of oregon and they did 
not challenge the portion of the property tax assessed against 
those flights 
but they said taxing aircraft simply because they have flown 
over that state violates the constitutions dueprocess 
guarantees and its protection for interstate commerce 
the airlines said wisconsin and pennsylvania have similar taxes 
the case is alaska airlines vs oregon 89346

the supreme court today let federal officials 
place special limits on farmsupport payments for married couples 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to an 
agriculture department regulation that treats a husband and wife as 
one person when they apply for the payments 
the case stemmed from a department rule limiting how much money 
any person may receive in crop subsidies 
a group called women involved in farm economics or wife 
challenged the rule in 1988 when the maximum perperson payment 
was 50000 
wife founded in sidney neb in 1976 argued that married 
couples are barred unfairly from applying for two payments even 
though other farming partnerships are allowed to apply for multiple 
payments 
the regulation unfairly classified a husband and wife to be one 
person regardless of their separate interests and responsibilities 
the group said 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the regulation in 
june overruling a federal judge who had thrown it out 
the appeals court said treating a husband and wife as one person 
in such cases is reasonable because of their financial 
interdependence 
married couples as a group are more likely than other 
partners in farming enterprises to share completely in the products 
of their efforts the appeals court said 
the appeals court also noted that congress now permits a husband 
and wife to be treated as two people in special circumstances the 
amended law says couples may apply for double support payments if 
each engaged in unrelated farming operations prior to marriage and 
continue to operate separate farms during their marriage

the supreme court today killed penthouse 
magazine publisher robert gucciones 400 million lawsuit against 
the federal government in connection with the fbis abscam 
investigation 
the court without comment let stand rulings that dismissed 
gucciones suit 
in abscam a highly publicized sting operation in the late 
1970s fbi agents posed as representatives of phony arab sheiks 
looking for investment opportunities 
a key figure in the operation was melvin weinberg a con man 
turned fbi informant and middleman 
guccione said weinberg promised him that the bogus sheiks would 
finance an atlantic city nj casino if guccione would take part 
in bribing new jersey officials to obtain a casino license 
the magazine publisher said he refused to go along and weinberg 
then spread rumors that guccione had financial problems and was 
connected to organized crime figures 
as a result the suit said guccione was unable to secure 
legitimate financing for a casino from 1979 to 1983 
a 1983 senate report criticized the fbi for its handling of 
weinberg the report said the guccione episode is a chilling 
reminder of the risks imposed by lax procedures and inadequate 
supervision of an informant like weinberg 
gucciones suit accused federal officials of negligently 
supervising weinberg 
the government enjoys broad immunity from being sued but under 
the federal tort claim act has surrendered some of that protection

states in failing to supervise or otherwise avoid foreseeable 
risks the appeals court said

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
fbi agents multimilliondollar libel lawsuit over a book about a 
deadly 1973 confrontation between indians and federal agents at 
wounded knee sd 
the court without comment let stand rulings that threw out 
david prices suit against peter matthiessen author of in the 
spirit of crazy horse and viking penguin inc the books 
publisher 
on feb 27 1973 an armed group of indians with grievances 
about the federal governments handling of indian affairs occupied 
the village of wounded knee on the pine ridge indian reservation 
the fbi us marshals service and bureau of indian affairs 
police sealed off the village by setting up roadblocks before the 
71day standoff ended two indians were killed and a deputy marshal 
was wounded 
two years later two fbi agents were killed on the reservation 
leonard peltier a leader of the american indian movement was 
convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the two killings 
price an fbi agent assigned to the pine ridge reservation 
during much of the 1970s contended in his suit that the book 
falsely accused him of corruption and dishonesty for his role in 
investigating the occupation and shootout 
the 1984 suit had sought 25 million in compensatory damages 
plus punitive damages legal fees and court costs 
faced with the suit the publisher withdrew the book from 
circulation 
a federal judge dismissed the suit in 1988 after ruling that the 
suedover statements were expressions of matthiessens opinion and 
therefore absolutely immune from such legal action 
by that time court records indicate the defendants had spent 
over 1 million on the suit 
the judge also said price was a public official and that he had 
failed to prove the allegedly libelous statements were published 
with actual malice 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal last 
aug 7 agreeing that the published statements about price are 
expressed as opinion not fact 
the appeals court said price had failed to persuade us that 
this is a factual matter capable of the jurys resolution to show 
that he could demonstrate its falsity and to convince us that he 
could show with clear and convincing evidence that the author had a 
high degree of awareness of a particular statements probable 
falsity 
the appeals court added that agent price cannot surmount 
these obstacles implies no condemnation of him in its entirety 
crazy horse focuses more on public institutions and social forces 
than it does on any public official the sentiments it expresses 
are debatable we favor letting the debate continue 
in his appeal price said the lower courts wrongly portrayed as 
opinion and not facts allegations of specific criminal 
wrongdoing 
the case is price vs viking penguin 89741

the supreme court today refused to hear a 
constitutional challenge to a federal rule banning telephone 
companies from affiliating with cable television companies in their 
service area 
the justices without comment turned away arguments by a small 
indiana telephone company that the crossownership rule violates 
its freespeech rights 
government lawyers said the appeal filed by the northwestern 
indiana telephone co nitco should be rejected because the 
company had failed to raise its freespeech argument with the 
federal communications commission 
nitco provides telephone service in five communities south of 
gary ind the company is owned by robert and gerald mussman it 
has been in their family since 1932 
the fcc received a complaint in 1983 over nitcos leasing space 
on its telephone poles to northwest indiana catv inc for cable 
distribution lines the cable company is owned by robert mussmans 
son rhys 
the commission in 1985 ruled that the affiliation between nitco 
and the cable company violated the crossownership rule in effect 
since 1970 the commission ordered divestiture of the cable tv 
facilities in three communities within nitcos service area 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the commissions 
order last april after refusing to rule on nitcos constitutional 
challenge because it had not been raised before the commission 
northwest indiana catv last july sold the cable systems that 
were the subject of the commissions divestiture order 
the case is northwestern indiana telephone co vs fcc 89501

the supreme court today turned down the appeal 
of an ohio biochemist who sued for libel after he was called a 
quack and an outrageous hoke artist for opposing 
fluoridation of san antonios water supply 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that threw out 
john yiamouyiannis suit against the san antonio expressnews and 
columnist paul thompson 
the rulings also dismissed most of the libel allegations against 
the bexar county medical society and its spokesman dr randall 
priessig 
yiamouyiannis a resident of delaware ohio became involved in 
the public debate leading to a 1985 referendum on fluoridation in 
the texas city 
in an oct 25 column thompson chastised local radio talk show 
hosts for presenting an outrageous hoke artist and imported 
fearmonger as if he had solid credentials 
any radioman who cant spot the difference between a quack 
like yiamouyiannis and authorized spokesmen for the medical 
dental and research professions of the country ought to be kicked 
off the air thompson wrote 
the county medical association and preissig also referred to 
yiamouyiannis as a quack and asserted that he had headed an 
institution that opposed the pasteurization of milk and vaccines 
for smallpox and polio 
a state judge threw out the libel suit before it reached a jury 
and a state appeals court upheld dismissal of most of the 
allegations 
the appeals court said most of the references to yiamouyiannis 
are assertions of pure opinion and entitled to absolute 
immunity against libel suits 
but the appeals court said the medical association and preissig 
could be forced to defend themselves at trial for the statement 
about the institution yiamouyiannis was said to have headed 
the texas supreme court refused to hear the biochemists ensuing 
appeal last sept 13 
the appeal acted on today sought to reinstate the entire suit 
the case is yiamouyiannis vs thompson 89673

the supreme court today agreed to hear a 
challenge to a federal law aimed at helping victims of crime 
recover their losses 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by a former post 
office worker in texas ordered to repay a bank 90412 he allegedly 
stole through credit card fraud the worker pleaded guilty to a 
single count of credit card fraud specifying only that more than 
1000 had been stolen 
frasiel l hughey worked at a post office in san antonio when he 
was indicted for mail theft and credit card fraud he pleaded 
guilty to one count of running up charges of more than 1000 on a 
mastercard issued by mbank usa to hershey godfrey 
the government said it had evidence hughey stole 21 cards issued 
by mbank and warned him he might be ordered to repay the bank 
147646 
hughey said he should be required to repay only 10422 the 
amount he said was charged to godfreys card 
a federal judge sentenced hughey to eight years in prison and 
ordered him to repay 90412 to mbank 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the restitution 
order last july 
the appeals court gave an expansive intrepretation to the 
federal victim and witness protection act 
at the minimum the law does not limit restitution to the 
amount specified in an indictment the appeals court said the 
restitution order in hugheys case had a significant connection 
with the conviction offense 
one of the principal purposes of the act was to ensure that 
wrongdoers to the degree possible make their victims whole if 
restitution were limited to the count of conviction given the high 
levels of plea bargaining within our criminal system in the 
majority of cases a victim could not be made whole the appeals 
court said 
the appeals court also rejected hugheys plea that he is too 
poor to pay 
the justice department urged the supreme court not to disturb 
the appeals court ruling the department said limiting the amount 
of restitution to the amount someone is convicted of stealing would 
violate congresss intent to compensate crime victims adequately 
the case is hughey vs us 895691

the supreme court today left it to a federal 
appeals court to take first crack at deciding whether louisianas 
system of higher education must undergo sweeping changes to help 
desegregate the states public colleges and universities 
the justices in a brief order said they do not yet have the 
authority to review the case the order means the case will proceed 
to the new orleansbased 5th us circuit court of appeals 
the justices last august blocked any ordered changes but 
todays action lifted that postponement enforcement of the 
desegregation plan envisioned by a threejudge federal court could 
begin unless the 5th circuit court grants a similar stay 
the threejudge courts july ruling would replace four governing 
boards with a single board over all public higher education in 
louisiana restrict admissions at some universities limit degree 
programs most schools can offer and establish a community college 
system 
the ruling also called for the gradual merging of the law 
schools at louisiana state university and southern university the 
states largest predominantly black school southerns 13000 
students attend three undergraduate campuses and the law school in 
baton rouge 
of the current four boards one governs the lsu system another 
governs the southern university system and a third oversees all 
other schools those three boards answer to the state board of 
trustees for higher education 
the present scheme has perpetuated illegal segregation in 
louisianas higher education the threejudge court ruled in a 
case begun in 1974 when justice department officials sued in 
behalf of black students 
the fourboard system has resulted in violations of a federal 
antidiscrimination law and the federal constitution the 
threejudge court said 
the lower court ordered designation of louisiana state 
university as the unified systems flagship school with the 
greatest number of graduate and research programs and the strictest 
admissions requirements 
it also called for creation of an intermediate level of four 
institutions including southern to offer significant doctoral and 
other graduate programs 
eight other schools including the predominantly black grambling 
state university would be designated as a third tier and limited 
to offering undergraduate degrees 
four colleges would become part of the new community college 
system 
court documents indicate that black enrollment at such 
historically white schools as lsu louisiana tech mcneese state 
nicholls state northeast louisiana and southeastern louisiana is 
less than 10 percent while blacks comprise over 99 percent of the 
enrollments at southern and grambling 
the threejudge courts ruling was appealed by the southern 
university board gov buddy roemers administration and attorney 
general william guste 
roemer and guste each said his appeal represented the states 
official views in the case and the governor in december asked 
the justices to dismiss gustes appeal 
the attorney generals appeal sought to have the threejudge 
courts ruling thrown out arguing that statistics alone on the 
race of students at each school cannot prove unlawful bias when 
each school is open to students of any race 
the governors appeal also argued that the threejudge court 
wrongly ruled that the state was guilty of unlawful bias but did 
not attack that portion of the lower courts order requiring one 
governing board 
roemer has been a champion of a singleboard system but has not 
been able to get the state legislature to go along with the idea 
the bush administration urged the justices to send the case to 
the 5th circuit court and not agree to handle an appeal directly 
from the threejudge court 
justice department lawyers argued that the case should have been 
handled by a lone trial judge and not the special threejudge court 
taking issue with that view roemer attorney john n kennedy 
told the justices all of higher education in louisiana is 
awaiting final resolution he urged the high court not to send 
the case to the 5th circuit court where any decision is likely to 
be appealed to the supreme court 
until this litigation is resolved kennedy said the 
operations of louisianas colleges and universities remains subject 
to extraordinary confusion and instability 
the cases are louisiana ex rel guste vs us 89556 southern 
university board of supervisors vs us 89557 and louisiana ex 
rel roemer vs us 89771

rival shiite moslem militias called a 
sevenhour truce today to allow the red cross to evacuate at least 
17 bodies that had been lying in the fields of battle in southern

militiamen of the syrianbacked mainstream amal movement which 
has been fighting the proiranian hezbollah or party of god

after palestinian guerrillas deployed in southern lebanon to form a 
buffer zone to disengage the shiite militias 
but elsewhere in the iqlim altuffah province particularly 
around the villages of jarjou jbaa and ein bouswar hezbollah and 
amal fighters kept up a steady exchange of artillery fire 
the 17 victims recovered today raised the overall toll in the 
17dayold intershiite battle to 94 killed and 275 wounded by 
police count 
the international committee of the red cross dispatched eight 
ambulances and eight station wagons with medical teams from beirut 
to evacuate casualties trapped in the fighting a red cross

of dozens of decomposed bodies lying in the fields in addition to 
wounded civilians and combatants in urgent need of medical care

hatta kfar milki and kfar beit as the red cross teams rolled in 
about 700 palestine liberation organization guerrillas now man a 
threemile buffer separating the villages of kfar hatta kfar milki 
and kfar beit 
that prevents the two sides from launching major ground attacks 
but it does not stop them firing artillery shells and rockets over 
the heads of the palestinian guerrillas in the buffer 
the fighting had raged southeast of the palestinian refugee 
camps of ein elhilweh and mieh mieh near sidon a provincial 
capital 25 miles south of beirut 
police has said the guerrillas intervention was ordered by plo 
chief yasser arafat to prevent either shiite faction from gaining 
territory from which the two camps arafats main power base in 
lebanon can be shelled 
hezbollahs spiritual guide sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
said in an interview published by the conservative beirut daily 
newspaper alanwar on monday that the shiitte war is drawing to 
an end he did not elaborate 
the two shiite groups for two years have struggled for power 
within the 12 millionstrong shiite community lebanons largest

the supreme court today agreed to settle a 
conflict over the governments power to keep taxes withheld from 
businesses about to declare bankruptcy 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the trustee of bankrupt 
american international airways seeking to recover 700000 in taxes 
paid to the internal revenue service 
the airline company had become delinquent by the spring of 1984 
in withholding social security and income taxes from employee wages 
and excise taxes collected from passengers 
the irs then ordered the airline to file monthly instead of 
quarterly tax returns and open a special bank account to handle 
the tax deposits 
american international filed for bankruptcy on july 19 1984 to 
try and reorganize the business and pay off some of the money owed 
creditors that effort failed and three months later a trustee was 
appointed to liquidate the company 
the trustee sought to recover 16 million in taxes paid to the 
irs in the months leading up to the liquidation 
a bankruptcy judge in pennsylvania permitted the trustee to 
recover 700000 from the government and the irs appealed to the 
3rd us circuit court of appeals based in philadelphia 
the appeals court ruled last june that the trustee may not 
recover the 700000 the balance collected by the irs was not at 
issue in the decision 
the appeals court said that under federal law the withheld taxes 
must be considered placed in a special fund held in trust for the 
irs and are not part of the companys property protected by the 
bankruptcy proceedings 
the justice department asked the supreme court to take the case 
even though the governments position was upheld by the 3rd circuit 
court the department said another federal appeals court has issued 
a conflicting ruling and the high court should resolve the split 
the case is begier vs irs 89393

a bitter debate has erupted within 
president virgilio barcos government over a beefedup us naval 
force in the caribbean with barco favoring the operation a 
newspaper reported today 
two opposition parties today protested the increase in us air 
and sea patrols in international waters in the caribbean the 
united states said the operation is an attempt to deter drug 
smugglers 
on sunday barcos foreign minister julio londono paredes 
reportedly said colombia rejects any attempt to search colombian 
ships even in international waters 
some news reports based upon londonos comments interpreted 
that to mean that barco himself was angry with the united states 
and that there was a rift between washington and the barco 
government 
apparently the rift is within the colombian government itself 
with the foreign minister and barco at odds a bogota daily with 
access to barco advisers said today 
barco accepts the us action and is at odds with his foreign 
minister la prensa said londono has never been proamerican on 
international issues it said 
the falling out between londono and barco started with the us 
invasion of panama on dec 20 the newspaper said the paper 
indicated that barco supported the invasion and londono was opposed 
la prensa is owned by juan carlos pastrana the son of former 
president misael pastrana the daily has repeatedly shown that it 
has reliable sources within the barco government 
another bogota newspaper el tiempo on sunday printed what it 
said was a government statement saying colombia would refuse to 
take part in the us antidrug program a government spokesman 
today said no such statement existed 
in washington on sunday bush administration officials 
acknowledged some difficulties with colombian authorities over 
their plans to deploy warships in the caribbean in a new campaign 
against drug traffickers 
the national security adviser brent scowcroft blamed the 
problems on some premature and probably inaccurate leaks 
about us intentions 
the barco administration has since august been engaged in a 
bloody war with cocaine barons the governments war with 
traffickers while seen as courageous by other countries has 
received little support within colombia 
the opposition conservative party and the leftist patriotic 
union party today criticized the us action 
the us embassy in bogota said saturday the move to step up air 
and sea patrols would be carried out far from the colombian 
coast 
the embassy announcement came amid persistent radio reports in 
colombia that a united states naval force was planning to enter the 
latin american countrys territorial waters to set up a blockade 
off its coast 
the bush administration has not said how many ships and aircraft 
will participate in the drug interdicition operation off the 
colombian coast though the aircraft carrier john f kennedy will 
reportedly be involved 
the administration has not given the date on which the 
operations are to begin the jfk and an accompanying guided missile 
cruiser the uss virginia left norfolk va on thursday for what 
the pentagon said were routine training exercises in the atlantic 
an aircraft carrier normally has eight or 12 smaller ships as 
part of its battle group along with an aircraft wing composed of 
about 3000 men and dozens of observation and tracking planes 
it is estimated that drug cartels in colombia are responsible 
for processing and smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine sold on us 
streets 
soon after barco intensified his governments struggle against 
drug traffickers on aug 18 the united states pledged 65 million 
in military aid to help in the fight 
us officials have said there are between 50 and 100 us 
military personnel in the country to help train colombian security 
forces to use the donated equipment 
months ago the barco administration ruled out the use of us 
military forces to fight drug traffickers within colombias borders

federal investigations of billy carters 
activities destroyed him financially the first brother of 
former president jimmy carter said in a book he wrote before his 
death in 1988 
grand juries investigated billy carters role in the family 
peanut warehouse and whether the business helped bankroll jimmy 
carters presidential campaign 
the senate held hearings into billy carters involvement with a 
deal between the libyan government and an american oil company and 
the former presidents younger brother also got into trouble with 
the internal revenue service 
carter wrote that testifying and defending himself was a 
fulltime job for two years required four law firms and cost me 
a small fortune 
the hearings wiped me out financially carter wrote in 
billy published by edgehill publications a subsidiary of 
edgehill newport a center for the treatment of alcoholism and drug 
abuse at newport ri the book is in limited national distribution 
in hard cover and paperback 
carter had nearly completed the book before he died of 
pancreatic cancer in september 1988 writer ken estes and sybil 
carter billys wife of 33 years and coauthor of the book 
completed the final chapter 
in part the book is an effort to set the record straight 
and a way for carter to help others battling alcoholism mrs 
carter said in an interview with the albany herald 
he never ceased to be amazed that people would come up or send 
letters that said i quit drinking because of you it really 
touched him 
people identified with billy because he said what he thought 
mrs carter said 
billy carter wrote of his years of high jinks during his 
brothers presidency but the book also covers his childhood his 
battle with alcoholism and his last days fighting cancer 
he also wrote of his closeness to his mother miss lillian 
carter and how they both enjoyed a good argument carter also 
credited his mother who died in 1983 for one of his bestknown 
quotes 
according to carter his mother first turned the phrase ive 
got a son who thinks he can be president a daughter ruth who is 
a faithhealer another daughter gloria who rides around on 
motorcycles and another son who drinks beer all the time if i had 
known they would turn out the way they have i would have remained 
a virgin

joined the peace corps at 68 a brother who wants to be president 
a sister who is a holyroller preacher and another sister who 
rides around on motorcycles im the only sane one in the family

lawyers and judges concede their profession 
probably wont set any standards for social graces but theyre 
giving good manners a shot nevertheless 
a new lawyers creed the first such statewide code in the 
nation was recently approved by the texas supreme court and the 
texas court of criminal appeals 
it asks the states 52000 lawyers for kinder litigation 
no more obnoxiousness no more titfortat unprofessional 
behavior no more stalling tactics and no allusions to personal 
peculiarities or idiosyncrasies of opposing counsel will be 
allowed according to the creed lawyers and judges say the 
letsbecivil creed is overdue 
its kind of like dieting texas supreme court justice 
eugene cook said its a battle that we can win but its not 
going to be done overnight 
cook said the creed was initiated by dallas and houston legal 
associations to fight bad behavior and needlessly aggressive 
courtroom tactics 
the offending behavior from rudeness to engaging in lengthy 
procedural delays to even resorting to fistfights has been 
clogging court schedules and hampering disposition of cases 
cook said some lawyers try to reschedule proceedings on dates 
most likely to bother an opponent 
if they know of a time that will be inconvenient say the day 
your wife is having a baby or the week youve been planning all 
year for a vacation thats when theyll schedule it he said 
some people think that its the way to practice law to be 
rude and abusive and try to intimidate the other side 
he said the problems have become increasingly common in the last 
five years 
us district judge a joe fish said part of the problem may be 
the increase of lawyers in the states largest cities 
i think the rambo tactics arise out of the feeling that im 
never going to see the other lawyer again he said 
dallas bar association president al ellis said financial woes 
also have increased courtroom problems 
as the law firms have gotten bigger and the economy has gone 
down theres been a lot of pressure on younger and 
middlemanagement lawyers to produce and some have responded with 
this kind of behavior he said 
the 34part lawyers creed developed by a committee with 
representatives from 18 legal associations relies on voluntary 
compliance and includes no specific penalties 
the creed includes requirements of civility toward peers and 
judges and a ban on antagonistic or obnoxious behavior 
some judges have copies of the creed pasted to their 
courthouse doors cook said they tell the lawyers go outside 
and read it and dont come back in until they learn how to act 
accordingly

a citizens group has asked the government to stop 
building a golf course near tokyo unless it can show that weed 
killers and other chemicals used on the course wont pollute their 
water an official said monday 
it was the first time such a request had been made to the 
environmental disputes coordination commission set up in 1972 to 
settle pollution issues by arbitration said takashi tachi of the 
prime ministers office 
suzoko ishizaki one of the leaders of the group said weed 
killers and other chemicals to be used on the seibu hanno country 
club course would contaminate water supplies in the city of hanno

ready to take any remedial measures that the government suggests

dispute through negotiations

nasa conducted a stopandgo 
countdown and waited until the last possible minute monday before 
it knuckled under to clouds and scrubbed the launch of the space 
shuttle columbia for 24 hours 
nice try said launch director bob sieck 
the launch was rescheduled for 735 am tuesday 
air force weather officers had bet 8020 against weather 
permitting a launch monday but they said chances were 7030 that 
conditions would be favorable tuesday with a potential for low 
clouds and fog 
columbia with a fivemember crew is scheduled to spend 10 days 
in space to launch a navy communications satellite and to retrieve 
a bussize scientific satellite that will crash to earth in march 
if the rescue fails 
despite mondays rotten odds nasa officials decided to go 
through the complex launch routine on the slim chance of finding a 
hole in the clouds and also to exercise the refurbished facilities 
on launch pad 39a which had not been used in four years 
in fact the count was interrupted once while six 
troubleshooters checked a potential pressure problem with a valve 
system that sprays the launch pad with 300000 gallons of water 
just before liftoff the water absorbs the sound from the engines 
preventing it from bouncing back into the engines and causing 
damage 
the technicians determined that a zero pressure reading was 
false and that the system was ok 
nasa estimates that a launch abort on a weekday costs an extra 
624000 at the kennedy space center alone including 377000 in 
lost fuel there are additional costs at other nasa sites around 
the world the cost of a single shuttle launch is estimated between 
250 million and 300 million 
commander dan brandenstein and his crew had been strapped into 
their flight seats for nearly four hours while weather reports 
teetered between go and nogo finally mission control in houston 
radioed were not going to make it 
over the pad the sky was fairly clear but a 30milewide bank 
of clouds approaching from the west at 6000 feet would have made 
an emergency return difficult for brandenstein who would have to 
land the unpowered space ship on a concrete runway near the launch 
pad 
it was the fourth postponement for this particular mission but 
it was only the first time that astronauts were on board suited up 
and ready to go into space 
the mission is to be the first of 10 for 1990 the most for one 
year since the challenger explosion four years ago 
during their flight the astronauts first are to deploy a navy 
communications satellite 
then they are to chase capture and bring home a satellite 
called the long duration exposure facility or ldef the satellite 
essentially a 12sided frame is packed with 57 experiments many 
testing the ddurability of various materials exposed to space 
the satellite has spent nearly six years in orbit and if it 
isnt retrieved trackers estimate atmospheric drag will make it 
fall out of orbit and burn up about march 9 its experiments lost 
forever

romanias roman catholic bishops gathered 
last week for the first time since 1948 to discuss ways of 
rebuilding the church after 40 years of communist suppression an 
italian church official said monday 
eleven bishops met jan 34 in alba julia to examine the new 
prospects for the church following the fall of nicolae ceausescus 
hardline regime according to the director of the italian catholic 
relief agency caritas 
monsignor giuseppe pasini who just returned from romania said 
the meeting was attended by archbishop francesco colasuonno pope 
john paul iis special envoy for eastern europe 
colasuonno met with the pope monday the vatican said without 
elaborating 
pasini said there are wellfounded hopes the vatican and 
romania can reestablish diplomatic relations which were broken in 
1950 when the papal nuncio was expelled from bucharest 
he said the romanian bishops agreed on the need to reestablish 
religious congregations form a national bishops conference and 
obtain full freedom to exercise their pastoral duties 
pasini said there are an estimated 23 million catholics in 
romania about 10 percent of the population they include 145 
million latin rite catholics of whom 1 million are from the 
hungarian minority and 150000 are germanspeaking 
but pasini said those most urgently in need of help are the 
pastors and followers of the eastern or byzantine rite catholic 
church which was suppressed in 1948 and forcibly incorporated into 
the orthodox church 
their 1800 churches were confiscated and bishops and priests 
who refused to accept the merger were jailed pasini said the 
number of eastern rite catholics totaled 18 million in 1948 but 
todays figure is not known because the faithful have been living 
an underground existence he said 
five eastern rite bishops attended last weeks meeting 
the most shocking thing that came out of the meeting is the 
state of poverty and abandon in which the eastern rite catholics 
live pasini said 
last week the new romanian leadership abolished two 40yearold 
decrees that suppressed the byzantine rite church 
pasini said the latin rite church also suffered under 
ceausescus regime with religious freedom severely restricted 
dioceses reduced from six to two ordination of priests limited to 
six a year and homes of clergy bugged by the secret police

a man convicted of killing his wife and 
disposing of her body by using a wood chipper was sentenced today 
to 50 years in prison 
richard crafts a former airline pilot was sentenced after 
superior court judge martin l nigro rejected a defense motion for 
a new trial 
crafts told the judge that he had been wrongly portrayed as a 
coldblooded killer but didnt address the issue of whether he had 
killed his wife 
a great deal has been said about my apparent lack of emotion 
he has ice water in his veins crafts said during brief remarks 
before he was sentenced i have feelings like everyone else 
crafts 52 was convicted of killing 39yearold helle crafts a 
danishborn flight attendant on nov 18 or 19 1986 at their 
newtown home prosecutors said he cut the body with a chain saw and 
fed parts through a wood chipper on a bridge between newtown and 
southbury he could have been sentenced to 25 years to life in 
prison for his murder conviction 
crafts sister karen rodgers who has custody of the couples 
three young children urged nigro to impose the maximum sentence 
i am concerned that mr crafts has not publicly nor privately 
demonstrated any remorse for the murder of his wife rodgers 
said i believe he has paid lip service only to the concerns of 
his children 
the judge rejected a defense motion to set aside the conviction 
and order a new trial saying there was no evidence that the case 
had been tainted by tape recording by state police 
the hartford courant reported in november that connecticut state 
police routinely taperecorded telephone conversations at state 
police barracks including calls between suspects and lawyers the 
newspaper based its report on disclosures made during an unrelated 
trial 
recording calls between lawyers and clients is forbidden under 
federal law 
farver said he had no direct evidence that state police 
illegally taped any telephone conversations with crafts and 
acknowledged such an argument traditionally would be raised after 
sentencing 
but he said he wanted to formally raise the issue before 
sentencing and would reintroduce the argument on appeal 
police found body parts including a fingernail and human 
tissue on the banks of the housatonic river the prosecutions 
case also hinged on the testimony of witnesses who said they saw a 
man with a wood chipper on the bridge nov 20 
crafts has been held at the bridgeport community correctional 
center

an argument apparently has begun in the 
government over increased us naval activity in the caribbean 
against drug traffickers which president virgilio barco is said to 
favor 
the united states has said it is increasing air and sea patrols 
in international waters and protests came monday from the 
opposition conservatives and leftist patriotic union party in 
colombia 
protests were expected because barcos 5monthold confrontation 
with the colombian cocaine barons seen as courageous in other 
countries has received relatively little support at home 
confusion over colombias position on the us action resulted 
from a statement sunday by foreign minister julio londono paredes 
that the government rejects any attempt to search colombian ships 
some international news reports based on londonos comments 
interpreted that to mean barco was angry with the united states 
la prensa a bogota daily with access to presidential advisers 
said monday the problem appears to be within the colombian 
government and stems from a dispute between barco and his foreign 
minister 
barco has said nothing so far and his office has issued no 
statements 
a diplomat with the us embassy told the associated press on 
monday that barco had not sent a protest note or objected in any 
other way officially or unofficially to the increase of caribbean 
patrols the official asked to remain anonymous so he would not 
become a target of the cocaine gangs 
according to la prensa the president accepts the us action 
and londono never has been proamerican on an international issue 
the falling out began with the us invasion of panama la 
prensa said it suggested barco supported the invasion and his 
foreign minister was opposed 
juan carlos pastrana son of former president misael pastrana 
owns la prensa the paper has been aggressive in reporting attempts 
by lawyers for the drug lords to negotiate a truce in the war on 
traffickers that began in august 
londono arrived home from a vacation sunday and said in 
response to reporters questions at the airport the colombian 
government does not accept nor will it ever accept any type of 
interference with ships carrying the colombian flag on the high 
seas 
any type of interference on the high seas would need the 
authorization of the colombian government especially of the 
ministry of defense 
when barcos office was asked if that was the official colombian 
position and whether barco was upset about not being told in 
advance that a us task force would sail into the caribbean 
spokesman julio carlos gonzalez said barco had no official comment 
londono said it just isnt possible to suppose that a country 
like the united states which has the most sophisticated methods 
available for intercepting and controlling ships and planes 
entering its own territory should have to go into international 
waters to carry out what it should be doing in its own territory 
us efforts to intercept drugs in its own territory obviously 
have failed he said 
adding to the confusion about colombias official positiion was 
a report sunday by the bogota daily el tiempo that barcos office 
issued a statement saying colombia would not contribute warships to 
the us effort in the caribbean 
gonzalez the barco spokesman said the el tiempo story was not 
based on any barco statement because none had been issued 
a us embassy statement last week said the navy patrols were 
merely an exercise in increased vigilance not a new policy and 
would take place in international waters 
if colombia does not join the patrols one reason might be lack 
of equipment and manpower its navy has three corvettes which are 
smaller than destroyers a submarine that is under repair and a 
variety of patrol boats 
the colombian navys main tasks are fighting drug traffickers 
and five leftist guerrilla groups which means patrolling thousands 
of miles of pacific and caribbean coastline it has intercepted 
several boats that were smuggling guns to guerrillas

the supreme court reviving a controversy from 
the 1988 presidential campaign said monday it will referee a 
dispute over a governors power to withhold national guard troops 
from peacetime training in central america 
the justices agreed to hear an appeal by minnesota officials 
contesting the federal governments authority to override a 
governors objection and send members of a states national guard 
on foreign training missions 
the court which last april rejected a similar appeal by 
massachusetts officials is expected to announce a ruling in the 
minnesota case by july 
the matter became an issue in the 1988 presidential campaign 
when democratic candidate michael dukakis the massachusetts 
governor denounced the reagan administration for what he called a 
failed and illegal policy of supporting the nicaraguan contra 
rebels he said sending national guard troops to the region was an 
attempt to intimidate nicaragua 
the justice department described dukakis position as a dagger 
aimed at the heart of national defense 
by contrast gov rudy perpich of minnesota has said he 
considers the issue one of states rights and has not been critical 
of reagan or bush administration foreign policy perpich joined 
other minnesota officials in appealing to the supreme court in 
mondays case 
twelve members of a minnesota national guard public relations 
unit were in panama on a training mission last month when us 
forces invaded there the minnesota residents returned to the 
united states a day after the invasion began dec 20 
perpich did not try to prevent the troops from training in 
panama 
now that the supreme court has decided to hear it weve 
got a good legal footing for that appeal he said monday 
the focus of the controversy is a 1986 federal law known as the 
montgomery amendment which limits the power of governors to 
withhold their consent to federal deployment of national guard 
units 
the amendment was enacted after several governors said they 
opposed the reagan administrations central american policy and did 
not want national guard troops from their states assigned to 
training missions in that region 
the amendment prohibits any governor from withholding consent to 
a national guard units active duty outside the country because of 
an objection to the location purpose or schedule of the duty 
there has been dual control over the national guard since 
congress made it a component of the army in 1933 
anyone joining the national guard enrolls simultaneously in a 
state militia organization and a reserve component of the national 
armed forces 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled in june that the 
montgomery amendment is constitutional and rejected arguments by 
minnesota officials 
the appeals court said the federal governments authority to 
provide for national defense is primary and the states power to 
organize militias cannot constrain congress authority to train 
the guard as it sees fit 
the bush administration said minnesotas position is 
contradictory justice department lawyers said that under the 
states view congress could require national guard troops to 
fight a war abroad but would lack the authority to prepare and 
train them abroad for such an eventuality 
according to figures quoted by the 8th circuit court the army 
national guard provides 46 percent of the armys combat units and 
28 percent of its support forces 
the air national guard provides a substantial portion of the 
nations air defenses including 73 percent of interceptor forces 
25 percent of tactical fighters and 24 percent of tactical air 
support

hundreds of radical students burned 
effigies of the us ambassador and president roh taewoo on monday 
in the southern city of kwangju to protest the envoys visit 
reports said 
a separate group of 100 protesters threw human excrement and 
tear gas powder near a police station several hundred yards from 
the us cultural center residence that us ambassador donald 
gregg visited the news reports said 
gregg who apparently did not see the protests was the first 
us ambassador to visit the city since a 1980 civil uprising in 
which 200 civilians died and 1500 were wounded 
many kwangju citizens believe washington condoned the 
mobilization of the korean military to put down unrest and silence 
government dissent washington has denied the allegations 
about 500 radical students yelling antiamerican slogans battled 
900 riot police with firebombs and rocks at kwangjus chosun 
university said yonhap the south korean news agency 
fierce fighting continued for an hour inside the campus after 
riot troopers moved in to break up a rally yonhap and newspapers 
reported the troopers were supported by two armored fans firing 
tear gas the reports said no injuries or arrests were reported 
gregg came here under a scheme with roh taewoo trying to 
unilaterally shelve the kwangju issue yonhap quoted a student 
leader at the rally as saying 
police have been on alert since the ambassador arrived sunday 
for a threeday visit korean news reports said he was protected by 
plainclothes officers 
the hankook ilbo a seoul daily said police advised against 
greggs visit but us officials said an explanation of 
washingtons role in kwangju should be resolved through dialogue 
i came here not to make an apology but to express regret and 
condolences to kwangju citizens gregg said monday according to 
news reports he also denied any us involvment in putting down 
the uprising 
gregg said the united states urged the south korean government 
in 1980 to settle the protests in kwangju peacefully but our 
influence was not enough over the south korean government yonhap 
said 
antiamerican sentiment is strong and the us cultural center 
in kwangju was attacked 28 times before it was closed last year to 
protect the staff gregg has said he hopes it will reopen soon 
three dissident groups issued statements opposing his visit the 
ambassador invited dissidents and leading citizens to a dinner to 
explain the us position on kwangju but yonhap said many stayed 
away in protest 
we rejected his invitation because the truth about kwangju and 
the possible us role have not been clarified said chun 
kyeryang a leading dissident and relative of a victim of the 
uprising 
last week the us embassy issued a statement rejecting former 
president chun doohwans reference to an alleged us role in the 
kwangju incident 
chun said in parliamentary testimony dec 31 that he then an 
army general decided on the military suppression of the uprising 
after receiving information from the united states that the 
military threat from communist north korea was increasing 
the us embassy said the united states did not see any evidence 
of heightened threats from north korea at the time 
gregg a former cia station chief in seoul has been the target 
of protests since he was appointed ambassador last year on oct 
13 six radical students broke into his residence and hurled 
homemade bombs at police before being overpowered gregg and his 
wife meg were unhurt

drug problems worsened last year in more than 
half the nations cities making the issue the top worry of urban 
leaders a survey of elected officials said monday 
fewer than one city in 10 reported making any headway locally in 
the war on drugs according to the survey by the national league of 
cities 
theres been a lot of talk about drugs coming out of 
washington and our city leaders are now sending back a message a 
message that its time for washington to get a frontline report on 
whats happening and whats needed said alan beals executive 
director of the league 
the drug issue must be a national priority local officials 
are saying because they cannot beat it on their own he said 
the league surveyed elected municipal officials mayors and 
council members from 314 cities selected randomly from the 2461 
cities with a population of 10000 or more 
officials in 58 percent of cities surveyed said drug problems 
had worsened in their communities over the past year another 31 
percent said the magnitude of the drug problem remained the same 
and 9 percent reported progress 
drugs led the list of top concerns of city officials one in 
five said that if they could meet with president bush on any topic 
they would focus on drugs 
clearly our local leaders believe there is a need for national 
leadership and a stronger commitment of national resources to help 
eradicate the poisonous and violent drug culture that has invaded 
our cities beals said 
on other topics 39 percent said their cities would have to 
raise local taxes this year nearly half said they would increase 
various user fees and almost twothirds said their citys spending 
will increase 
beals at a news conference releasing the study said cities 
leaders are making the tough choices on their own by raising 
taxes without waiting for the federal government to provide more 
help he decried a fend for yourself national approach of the 
last decade with the federal government withdrawing aid to cities 
the league survey was conducted by telephone in november and 
early december by the center for urban studies at wayne state 
university in detroit beals said it was a scientific sample and 
it carried a stated margin of error of plus or minus 55 percentage 
points 
beals said there was discontent among urban leaders with the 
federal governments allocation of money to fight drugs the 22 
billion in federal drug assistance goes to the states he said 
but its needed in our cities where the war against drugs is 
being fought 
he said the survey found nearly half 47 percent described 
relations with their state government as fair at best 22 
percent said they were poor and 28 percent said good 
other top concerns cited by the city officials as needing 
presidential attention were financial constraints and the lack of 
federal aid to go with federally required local programs solid 
waste and other environmental problems education and affordable 
housing 
besides drugs city leaders reported worsening conditions 
involving the cost of living affordability of housing energy 
costs crime and solid waste

different from the rest of the central ballets repertoire so as 
to expand their potential 
the dance he said is classically based but uses the attack 
and thrust as well as the movement ideas of contemporary dance

welcome for mikhail s gorbachev when he arrives in their restive 
republic this week a proindependence rally they expect will draw 
hundreds of thousands 
sajudis the lithuanian grassroots political movement is 
putting out the call on radio and tv for a giant demonstration upon 
the soviet presidents arrival wednesday in the republics capital 
of vilnius according to longinas vasiliauskas a sajudis spokesman 
this demonstration is needed to show gorbachev and the world 
that the lithuanian people has already made its choice for a free 
and independent state he said sunday by telephone from vilnius 
gorbachev reportedly is scheduled to spend three days in 
lithuania this week trying to heal the rift between the republics 
breakaway communist party and moscow on dec 20 a majority of 
lithuanian communists voted to break ties with the national party 
a possible precursor to secession by the baltic republic of 37 
million people 
gorbachev criticized the move saying the communists were giving 
in to separatists but leaders of the breakaway party who met 
with gorbachev in moscow last week said he also promised not to 
interfere if they stuck with their decision 
vasiliauskas said gorbachevs remarks about separatists prompted 
sajudis call for the rally 
sajudis intends for gorbachev to see for himself that there is 
no alternative for lithuania besides independence he said

joined hands last summer to protest the 1939 sovietnazi pact that 
allotted the baltic states to the soviet sphere

lithuania who oppose their partys bold break with the national 
party and an estimated 3000 people back home rallied to support 
them the protesters at the central sports palace in vilnius

nationalistic and chauvinistic overtones in their republic and 
to restore the unity of the communist party

loyalists the official news agency tass said only that gorbachevs 
talks with them and earlier meeting with the proindependence 
faction featured an exchange of opinions on a way out of the 
situation 
lithuanian communist party leader algirdas brazauskas said the 
meetings have helped the two sides understand each other

president bush struck a combative stance 
for the 1990 congressional session monday complaining it is past 
time for lawmakers to approve a capital gains tax cut and other 
white house proposals left hanging last year 
saying a capital gains bill would be a top priority bush 
declared i am sick and tired of the demagogues who call this a 
tax cut for the rich it means jobs it means savings and it is 
good for all americans 
many democrats in congress have opposed a reduction on grounds 
the chief beneficiaries would be the wealthy 
bush spelled out his legislative hopes in a speech to 8000 
delegates to the annual convention of the american farm bureau the 
nations largest farm organization with 38 million member families 
he also called for action on anticrime and cleanair 
legislation but the tax cut talk won the loudest applause from 
farmers bush reminded his audience that lower tax rates would 
apply to the sale of farmland 
on a separate issue bush also won cheers by saying i am 
mighty proud of the american forces who were sent to panama to 
depose manuel antonio noriega 
noriega is being held in miami on drugtrafficking charges and 
bush said the joy shown by the people of panama says it all 
the capital gains legislation concerns taxes on profits derived 
from the sale of stocks real estate and other assets bush has 
proposed lowering the top tax rate to 15 percent from the current 
tops of 28 percent and 33 percent 
a bushbacked plan was defeated last year when senate 
republicans could not muster the 60 votes necessary to break a 
democratic filibuster against it but lawmakers on both sides of 
the issue have expressed doubt that procedural devices could kill 
the proposal this year 
an aide to senate majority leader george mitchell who led the 
opposition last year said monday the maine democrat supported a 
capital gains tax reduction in 1986 and has said he will 
continue to support one if it meets three criteria if it doesnt 
adversely effect the budget deficit if it is targeted and if it 
is part of a fair and progressive tax structure 
one of every four democrats sided with republicans when the 
house voted for a capital gains cut last september but even some 
democrats who are longtime supporters of lower capitalgains taxes 
were unhappy with the bill because it would have provided a lower 
tax rate for only 2 years and then would have substituted a system 
under which gains caused by inflation would be excluded from 
taxation 
bush has not disclosed details of the cut he will propose in his 
jan 29 budget message however congressional republicans say they 
expect him to call for a plan that would provide a greater tax 
incentive the longer an asset is held thus profits from the sale 
of property owned for five years would be taxed less than would 
gains from something owned two years 
present law taxes capital gains at the same rates as other 
income 
the fight isnt over yet bush said contending that a 
capital gains tax cut would help keep american agriculture 
dynamic and prosperous 
more generally bush recalled that i put out my hand to the 
congress to the democratic majority in his inaugural address a 
year ago and offered lawmakers proposals on crime clean air and 
the capital gains tax cut 
now a year has past the new year is upon us and its time it 
is past time for congress to tend to some of the unfinished 
business bush said 
with congress due back in session jan 23 bush said the hand 
of cooperation is once again extended and i would only add 
america wants it done right america wants it done responsibly and 
america wants it done now 
after his speech bush toured futuristic exhibits of 
hightechnology agriculture at walt disneys epcot center he also 
visited the living seas building and came face to face with 
porpoises and scuba divers in a tank 
the trip came at the start of a year in which congress must 
update the 1985 farm legislation that reduced basic crop price 
supports saving billions of dollars for taxpayers 
crop subsidies this year are expected to total about 11 
billion far below the record 26 billion in 1986 
providing only a hint about the farm bill he will propose bush 
said we must have marketoriented farm policies that allow 
producers more flexibility to decide what crops to grow 
at the same time weve got to maintain a safety net to 
protect farmers from conditions beyond their control the 
president said 
moreover bush said weve got to expand markets and enhance 
productivity weve got to assure the public that americas food is 
the safest in the world and weve got to protect our precious 
environment 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has said he does not 
expect massive changes in the 1985 law but has acknowledged that 
the 1990 rewrite must tackle the issues of environmental and food 
safety 
bush said international markets for farmers are improving with 
us agricultural exports increasing last year for the third year 
in a row 
we also support expanding our ties with eastern europe and the 
soviet union to open even more markets bush said noting that 
yeutter led a delegation to poland to suggest ways it could shift 
to a market economy 
were forging new partnerships between our agriculture 
industries and eastern europes emerging economies

a cult leader wanted in the 
slayings of an ohio family of five was arrested near the mexican 
border by authorities who say weapons and survivalist gear were 
found in his motel room and a storage locker 
jeffrey lundgren 39 a former sundayschool teacher and tour 
guide in the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day 
saints in ohio was arrested outside the motel sunday by federal 
agents and county sheriffs 
lundgrens 38yearold wife alice and the couples 19yearold 
son damon also were arrested there three other lundgren children 
kristen 10 caleb 9 and jason 15 were taken into protective 
custody said andrew vita the special agent in charge of the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms office in los angeles 
this will relieve a lot of apprehension kirtland ohio 
police officer ronald k andolsek said late sunday on the 
lundgrens arrests in recent days kirtland police had been 
keeping close watch of the homes of residents who were once 
threatened by lundgren 
john hewicker a san diego county deputy district attorney who 
handles extraditions said today that the lundgrens told 
investigators they would refuse to waive extradition to ohio where 
they face charges that include aggravated murder and kidnapping 
the lundgrens will be in state court on tuesday for arraignment 
on fugitive charges hewicker said the extradition hearing would 
come later he said 
lundgren broke away from the reorganized church and persuaded 
other members to follow him officials said the group once lived 
on a 15acre farm near the clevelandarea town where investigators 
last week unearthed five bodies authorities believe the five are 
dennis avery his wife cheryl and their three young daughters 
investigators believe the averys were killed in midapril and 
buried in a common grave under the barn 
searches of the southern california motel room and a nearby 
storage area rented by jeffrey lundgren uncovered numerous weapons 
including an ar15 assault rifle as well as ammunition knives and 
gas masks vita said 
they had camping gear web gear that the military would wear 
things that can sustain you up in the mountains he said 
were not sure where they were going atf agent james 
stathes said 
authorities had been watching the motel since saturday night 
said george rodriguez a special agent for the atf in kansas city 
mo 
lundgren and 12 of his followers were indicted by a lake county 
ohio grand jury in the killings two followers kathryn renee 
johnson 36 of holden mo and daniel david craft 25 of nauvoo 
ill remain at large 
authorities were led to the motel in national city about five 
miles south of san diego by telephone calls made from a pay phone 
to another location under surveillance said steven c latourette 
a lake county prosecutor who held a news conference in painesville 
ohio 
this case continues to develop as a prosecutor ive got to 
tell you its a great case latourette said 
the prosecutor has said the averys apparently were killed in a 
cult sacrifice necessary under a prophecy of lundgrens before the 
cult could relocate 
however the president of the northeast ohio chapter of the 
reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints dale 
luffman said he thought the slayings resulted from a dispute over 
money sex or fear the family would leave the cult 
the church stripped lundgren of his lay minister credentials in 
1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines 
though the church has roots and some beliefs in common with the 
mormon church the two churches are separate

a former cattle rancher testified monday that 
navy jets screaming as low as 100 feet above his central nevada 
land terrified his livestock interfered in their breeding and 
eventually put him out of business 
don nonella testified at the opening of a federal court trial in 
his 87 million lawsuit against the navy which operates the 
fallon naval air station 60 miles west of the nonellas former 
ranch 
the government claims poor business practices and not noisy 
fighters ruined nonellas chances of success 
nonella testified that in may 1985 only 466 cows were 
successfully bred instead of the 800 he had anticipated he said 
the animals health and their feed were all acceptable 
he said he was baffled until one day when he was moving some 
cattle and a navy jet roared over 
i could see the pilot had glasses on i was that close to 
him nonella said it occurred to me at that time it might be 
the jet overflights 
nonella 58 and his wife barbara 52 filed suit last year 
over the daily training flights out of the naval air station about 
60 miles east of reno 
we put our life savings into the place and they put us out of 
business said nonella who nows lives in elko and drives trucks 
we couldnt operate out there because of the noise 
they are among dozens of residents who lived in the valleys 
under the navys designated air space for flight training and who 
have long complained that lowlevel jet flights shattered their 
nerves and sometimes property 
congress appropriated 109 million to buy about 100 parcels in 
dixie valley 70 miles east of fallon where some 35 families lived 
the nonellas owned their 1000head ranch from 1979 through 
1988 then abandoned it after they were unable to sell it 
no one would buy the place and we couldnt make our payments 
so we just deeded it back to the federal land bank don nonella 
said we just left 
the nonjury trial is expected to last more than one week

redoubt volcano rumbled alive today 
spitting ash and steam at least five miles into the air scientists 
said 
redoubt produced a vigorous eruption at 1020 am said 
steve brantley of the alaska volcano observatory 
pilots reported ash up to at least 26000 feet he said winds 
from the southwest were expected to carry the ash north and 
northeast 
the volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage rumbled awake dec 
13 after a 25year rest 
periodic eruptions since then have disrupted air traffic off and 
on including saturday but todays eruption did not immediately 
result in new flight restrictions the federal aviation 
administration said 
saturdays activity was clearly a minor event compared to 
eruptions last month and even earlier last week the observatory 
said scientists said that during the day the volcano continued to 
generate a vigorous plume of steam and volcanic gas to 
altitudes of 12000 to 15000 feet 
volcanic ash is of concern to pilots because it can shut down 
jet engines a boeing 747 operated by klm royal dutch airlines lost 
power to all four engines after flying through redoubt ash last 
month the engines were restarted and the plane made a safe 
emergency landing in anchorage

ben one of the kodiak bears who starred in 
the grizzly adams television series in the late 1970s has died 
during hibernation of chronic heart disease zoo officials said 
monday 
the bestknown resident of the folsom childrens zoo apparently 
died last week in his hibernation den zoo director john chapo said 
monday that ben apparently had been dead for several days when he 
was found by a zookeeper 
ben believed to be about 15 years old lived at the zoo for 10 
years the kodiak bear a subspecies of the brown bear has a life 
span of about 35 years 
the bears grumpy personality eventually made him unsuitable for 
movies and television work and his owners found a home for him in 
lincoln 
kodiak bears are among the largest carnivores in north america 
ben was about 8 feet tall and weighed 800 to 1000 pounds at death 
he was somewhat smaller than the largest kodiaks which can stand 
11 to 12 feet tall and weigh 1600 pounds 
ben usually would arouse from his hibernation on pleasant days 
and eat chapo said but saturday the zookeeper could not rouse him 
tests showed he died of chronic heart disease chapo said the 
condition could have been present from birth or might have 
developed later it had gone undetected because physical exams of 
such large animals are difficult and infrequent 
hed always been healthy acted fine chapo said there 
was no reason to put him under anesthesia to examine him which 
could be dangerous to such a big animal

an upbeat winnie mandela met her 
jailed husband nelson mandela on monday for talks about his 
widely expected release which she believes will be within weeks 
mrs mandela who visited her husband for three hours has never 
emerged from a visit so optimistic about prospects of freedom for 
mandela who has been jailed almost 28 years 
this is the first time i have accepted as a reality that he 
will be released this year mrs mandela said this is the real 
thing 
as recently as two weeks ago mrs mandela was playing down 
speculation that her husband would be freed early in 1990 
she said monday that no release date had been given to her or 
her husband asked whether it would be weeks or months from now 
however she replied i dont think we are talking about months 
since taking office in august president fw de klerk has freed 
several of mandelas colleagues from the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla movement and has indicated mandelas release 
will follow 
a broad range of black leaders have said they cannot accept de 
klerks invitation to negotiate a new constitution until mandela is 
freed 
there is strong speculation de klerk will make a statement about 
mandelas status when he opens parliament on feb 1 
the anc in a statement from its exile headquarters in lusaka 
zambia acknowledged the de klerk government was moving to 
dismantle apartheid but said it was premature to begin negotiations 
we are committed to seize any real opportunity that might 
emerge genuinely to seek a political agreement for the speedy end 
of the apartheid system alfred nzo the ancs secretarygeneral 
said in a statement marking the groups 78th anniversary 
however he added the armed struggle continues to be a 
critical and decisive component part of our strategy 
mrs mandela met with her husband in a former staff residence at 
victor verster prison farm in the winegrowing town of paarl near 
cape town 
she emerged in the company of lawyer omar dullah who said 
mrs mandela was requested by mr mandela to make the visit 
because he wanted to discuss with her some preliminary arrangements 
relating to his release in view of the general expectation that 
his release will be sooner rather than later 
mrs mandela declined to elaborate on the meeting 
suffice it to say it is the first time we have discussed the 
preliminary arrangements of what will happen after release she 
said 
asked how she felt she replied with a broad smile i think it 
is clear from my expression 
mandela 71 is south africas bestknown black leader there is 
widespread belief he could be elected president if the black 
majority had full voting rights 
he has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for 
plotting a sabotage campaign to undermine the whiterun government 
mandela has received a steady stream of visitors in recent 
weeks ranging from cabinet ministers to prominent antiapartheid 
leaders he met dec 13 with de klerk at the presidential office 
the country remains under a 43monthold state of emergency and 
the anc is officially banned de klerk has hinted however that he 
may lift some emergency restrictions and the recently released anc 
leaders leaders have campaigned openly on behalf of their 
organization 
they also have been granted passports and are expected to travel 
next week to anc headquarters in zambia 
in london anglican archbishop trevor huddleston a veteran 
antiapartheid campaigner on monday launched the nelson mandela 
international reception committee aimed at organizing 
celebrations when the black leader is released 
a statement by the committee urged towns and universities around 
the world that have honored mandela to arrange events

relatives of charles stuart who might have 
suspected he was involved in his wifes killing had no legal 
obligation under state law to report that to police legal experts 
say 
in massachusetts persons are criminally culpable for what 
they do for their acts not for what they know said frank 
chubert a professor of criminal justice at northeastern university 
in boston 
the issue was raised last week when stuarts youngest brother 
matthew implicated him in his pregnant wifes shooting death oct 
23 matthew stuart told police he disposed of a gun and her purse 
at his brothers request 
charles stuart apparently aware he had become a suspect 
committed suicide thursday as police sought to arrest him he had 
told police that a mugger shot him and his wife during a robbery 
after they left a hospital childbirth class 
matthew stuart reportedly told others of his suspicions 
legal experts say that although some people might have known the 
truth all along they cannot be held criminally liable under 
massachusetts law for withholding information 
there is no obligation said john dawley who was charles 
stuarts attorney but morally and ethically there are different 
standards 
about a dozen states but not massachusetts have good 
samaritan laws that require people to tell authorities if they 
know a crime has been committed said charles ogletree a professor 
at harvard law school but he said the law is rarely enforced 
its hard to persuade a jury to convict someone who said i 
saw a crime and i was scared to report it ogletree said in an 
interview friday 
also if such laws were strictly enforced they could have 
painful implications chubert said 
just think of where that goes he said does that mean mom 
and dad get prosecuted for failure to report you could use the 
power to lock up a persons family 
massachusetts also grants immunity for close relatives who 
become an accessory to a crime after the criminal act has been 
committed ogletree said typically he said immunity would be 
granted to a relative who hides a fugitive 
but in the case of matthew stuart the issue of legal protection 
might be more complicated experts said 
his attorney said matthew stuart at his brothers instruction 
met him the night of the shooting and took a bag containing a gun 
and mrs stuarts purse 
an important part of his story is that he wasnt aware mrs 
stuart was shot when he retrieved the items if in fact he knew 
that the crime was being committed then he might be crossing the 
line into aiding the crime in which he would not have the 
immunity ogletree said 
hes on thin ice said joseph balliro a criminal lawyer in 
boston thats going to be up to a grand jury to decide if they 
believe him or not believe him 
furthermore experts said the disposal of a gun can be 
considered a separate crime such as obstruction of justice 
if he goes out and hides the evidence of a crime then thats 
a nono balliro said friday 
john julian a spokesman for the suffolk county district 
attorneys office said friday he could not comment on whether 
stuart might be charged or receive immunity there is an ongoing 
grand jury investigation he said

florida restaurants especially those offering vegetarian fare in 
the wake of the christmas freeze that wiped out much of the states 
winter farms 
a few restaurant owners say theyve had to raise prices just to 
break even 
im a vegetarian restaurant so im feeling more than a 
pinch said james mckenna owner of the ciao sidewalk cafe in 
delray beach 20 miles north 
mckenna said a few weeks ago he was buying tomatoes for 850 a 
case but now he is paying 23 as a result he raised the price of 
the mealsized salads at his cafe by 25 cents thursday 
the taurus steak house in miamis coconut grove section has been 
adding a 175 surcharge for their salad bar since the day after 
christmas because fo the higher vegetable prices said dave hill 
jr the restaurants manager 
at ruby tuesday chain restaurants the prices have not changed 
but some days theyve left cherry tomatoes and green peppers off 
salads 
we have not increased our prices but weve had to delete a 
few items said craig marcy a senior assistant at ruby tuesday 
in fort lauderdales broward mall 
most big restaurant chains are bearing the cost without changes 
were just absorbing the extra cost said cheri grey of the 
steak amp ale regional headquarters in tampa this is just short 
term 
prices fluctuate in any market and effect the restaurant 
industry said frank pike chairman of the board of the palm beach 
county chapter of the florida restaurant association 
this happens in a multitude of categories beef stone 
crabs pike said they cant change their prices every time the 
market fluctuates 
pike said it is too early to assess the impact of increased 
vegetable costs on the restaurant industry as a whole

moslems picketed monday outside the publishers of 
the novel the satanic verses but organizers of the protest 
tried to distance themselves from the death threat against author 
salman rushdie 
at a news conference to announce the fiveday vigil mugharam 
alghamdi chairman of the uk action committee on islamic 
affairs said the demonstration is a reminder that the moslem 
outrage over the novel which started with its publication in 
september 1988 would not subside 
picketers outside viking penguin books handed out leaflets and 
carried signs proclaiming no rushdie porn hypocrisy in high 
places and put honor back on the agenda 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes islam by 
associating the prophet mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting 
the koran islams holy book was not the work of god on feb 14 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini issued a religious edict 
calling on moslems to kill rushdie 
khomeinis action drove rushdie into hiding and two iranian 
clerics offered a bounty of 52 million for indianborn writers 
death iranian leaders have not rescinded the threat after 
khomeinis death june 3 
since the sensationalism has receded what remains is a 
genuine and permanent bitterness in the hearts and minds of 
ordinary moslems alghamdi said 
although he warned that the bitterness would increase if the 
book were not withdrawn he and the uk action committee did not 
support the death threat 
we appeal all the time to moslems in britain to keep within 
the limits of the law said iqbal saraceni a committee leader 
we will not condone any overstepping of the law 
the committee however refused to condemn the death threat 
threats also have been made to penguin a police officer is on 
24hour duty outside and three security guards now watch over the 
entrance hall which is equipped with a metal detector 
viking penguin spokesman bob gregory said there was no 
connection between the vigil and publication of a paperback edition 
of the satanic verses 
there is no date set for publication of the paperback 
gregory said from that you cannot assume that a paperback 
version will be published or will not be published 
alghamdi said britains 15 million moslems want the satanic 
verses withdrawn from publication and britains blasphemy laws 
changed to incorporate other religions besides christianity 
moslem communities from across britain are taking turns 
picketing the west london offices during the protest 
on monday moslems from bradford 180 miles northwest of london 
were on duty 
weve seen a mixture of some people who are sympathetic and 
some people who disagree said liaqat hussain the general 
secretary of the bradford council for moslems 
the protesters handed out leaflets demanding withdrawal of the 
book a change in the blasphemy laws and for the moral support 
and goodwill of all our fellow citizens to further our just 
demands

a gun was stolen from the fur store where charles 
stuart once worked adding another twist to the grisly murder hoax 
that police now say was not so cunning after all 
the latest clue came monday with confirmation that a 38caliber 
revolver was stolen from the edward f kakas amp sons fur store where 
stuart worked as a manager and the gun might have been the weapon 
used to kill his pregnant wife and wound him 
i believe what happened with chuckie this was the doing of a 
sick mind pat reardon a cousin said monday 
stuart 29 committed suicide last week after his brother 
matthew implicated him in the crime charles stuart originally told 
police that he and his wife were the victims of a mugger who forced 
his way into their car oct 23 as they left a birthing class 
stuarts wife carol died hours after the shooting and their 
premature baby christopher died 17 days later 
matthew stuart 23 told authorities last week that he took mrs 
stuarts handbag which contained the gun from the scene and threw 
the items separately into the pines river in revere divers have 
recovered the handbag but not the gun 
jay kakas coowner of the fur store told police that a 
revolver was stolen from the safe at the store a representative of 
the store who asked not to be identified confirmed monday 
stuart also had access to the safe the representative said and 
the kakases thought to check the safe last week after police named 
stuart as the prime suspect 
investigators have refused to comment on the disappearance of 
the gun 
other flaws also have emerged in what some officials said at 
first looked like a nearperfect crime most notably matthew 
stuart was apparently not the only person to know of his brothers 
involvement he told his attorney that he told family members and 
friends about the scheme 
matthew stuart declined to comment on the case as he left the 
family home monday telling reporters i cant talk to you 
another brother michael stuart was questioned monday at the 
suffolk county district attorneys office his lawyer richard 
clayman said his client broke no laws 
legal experts say the family members had no legal duty to 
contact police about their suspicions 
there is no obligation john dawley who was charles 
stuarts attorney said last week but morally and ethically 
there are different standards 
police are investigating whether insurance was a motive behind 
the crime stuart collected 82000 on an insurance policy due his 
wife for her work as an attorney and a search of the couples 
reading home has turned up another 100000 policy on her 
according to various sources 
police reportedly also are investigating whether a romantic 
relationship between stuart and another woman might have been a 
factor 
news reports indicate a 22yearold woman who worked for two 
summers at the fur store repeatedly used stuarts telephone calling 
card number to call him while he was hospitalized after the october 
shooting 
prosecutors have declined to say whether more charges might be 
coming saying a grand jury investigation is continuing and that 
they are still assembling information obtained from scores of 
interviews since stuarts death 
the younger stuart told authorities that he was not aware mrs 
stuart had been shot when he met his brother at the crime scene 
members of the black community who have denounced what they say 
was a racist investigation into the stuart case met informally 
monday to discuss a proposed civilian panel to evaluate police 
misconduct 
in his story to police stuart said the mugger was black and 
during the investigation scores of black residents were searched 
and at least two black suspects were named 
we have to ease the tensions and avert similar problems in the 
future by establishing a civilian review board so black residents 
feel they can take their complaints to a fair and impartial body of 
citizens said city councilor charles yancey 
members of the statehouses black caucus have also said they 
plan to send a letter to us attorney wayne budd requesting a 
review of how the stuart investigation was handled

would remain in charge for the 18month transition period roberto 
said and the un force would be modeled after the one assuring 
transition to independence in neighboring namibia 
he said un troops would be responsible for making sure no 
foreign military aid reached either dos santos popular movement 
for the liberation of angola mpla or its chief rival the 
national union for the total liberation of angola of jonas savimbi 
all political or military prisoners held by both sides should be 
released under the plan roberto said 
robertos and savimbis groups along with mpla were 
signatories of the 1975 agreement that was supposed to lead to 
peaceful independence of angola then a portuguese colony 
but the pact fell apart and the national front for the 
liberation of angola was nearly annihilated in the late 1970s 
while savimbis unita has continued to battle the mpla government 
after the reagan aministration began aiding savimbi in 1986 
roberto also sought american help to reestablish his guerrillas 
apparently without success

shoppers were shocked and angered 
monday by steep price increases for food and other consumer goods 
despite a government campaign to prepare them for the 
belttightening measures 
the increases were part of an austerity package approved by 
parliament that will qualify hungary for new credits from the 
international monetary fund 
the trade unions maintain the increases will push as many as 3 
million of the countrys 106 million inhabitants below the 
official poverty line which was set on dec 31 at just over 80 a 
month 
i simply do not know how i am going to make ends meet said 
eva kekes a single publishing house editor expressing the 
sentiment of many hungarians 
the price increases will boost the consumer price level by 195 
percent almost equaling the governments forecast of 20 percent 
inflation for all of 1990 the mti news agency reported 
except for one specific brand of milk and bread producers will 
be free to set all food prices a fact that already has led to 
retail prices of meat and meat products going up an average 32 
percent dairy products by almost 43 percent and bread by 20 
percent 
cigarettes beer and spirits were 20 percent to 22 percent 
higher 
as word spread about the extent of the price increases store 
shelves began to empty and lines grew longer at stores and gas 
stations as people were hoarding on a large scale 
rice flour sugar vegetable oil canned meats frozen 
vegtables were sold out 
some customers were overheard saying just like poland where 
austerity measures took effect jan 1 
last week butchers were under siege and shelves soon emptied 
even of lard on saturday milk was impossible to find people were 
also buying detergents and similar products although these prices 
were not going up 
on friday and saturday the waiting time at gas stations was 
about three hours with people filling cans in anticipation of a 15 
percent to 17 percent increase 
on monday many food stores were closed because the staff was 
pricing items and restocking shelves 
ms kekes 36 said singles especially were hard hit because 
we have only one income yet pay high rents high utilities and 
high retail prices 
at the same time singles are discriminated against when 
seeking credit and when applying for housing she said 
peter huzella a folk singer in an aboveaverage income bracket 
said that past price hikes did not make that much of a 
difference but this one hit us hard 
our regular skiing trips are off and we have to rethink the 
special classes languages and sports the kids are taking 
said huzella who has has a wife who is working and three children 
aged 6 10 and 14 
i am sure well have enough to eat but i am really worried 
about the people i see around me especially those of my parents 
generation said huzella 40 
his wife hajnal said that with their jobs and the children 
there is simply no time to go bargainhunting well just have to 
save where we can 
cars imported from warsaw pact countries became 25 percent more 
expensive and sewage and water rates had already been raised by 
336 percent mti said 
apartment rents are to increase by an average 35 percent from 
feb 1 while postal charges went up by an average 22 percent 
monday

jury selection began monday for the assault and 
conspiracy trial of reputed mob boss john gotti and the judge said 
he will sequester the jurors because he is responsible for their 
wellbeing and comfort 
gotti 48 alleged to be the head of the gambino crime family 
and anthony guerrieri 60 are charged in the may 1986 shooting of 
john f oconnor of brewster vice president and business manager 
of the carpenters union local 608 a third defendant died in 
december 
state supreme court justice edward mclaughlin said the trial 
will last about three weeks with the jurors locked away in hotels 
when trial is not in session 
about threefourths of the initial pool of 300 prospective 
jurors said they were unable to sit on a sequestered jury for three 
weeks and were excused the remaining 77 were given 11page 
questionnaires about their personal histories and opinions 
earlier mclaughlin rejected a prosecution request for an 
anonymous jury saying the defense would be given the jurors names 
but not their home addresses or places of business 
the defendants in this case will stop at nothing to prevent 
their conviction on the charges currently pending against them 
assistant district attorney jeffrey schlanger said in court papers 
schlanger said that it took three trials to reach a verdict in 
1988 in a federal racketeering and narcotics case involving gottis 
brother gene and several associates because jurors were accosted 
and intimidated 
prosecutors say gotti commissioned members of a gang called the 
westies to shoot oconnor after oconnor had a restaurant 
vandalized for using nonunion carpenters 
oconnor shot in the buttocks apparently did not know the 
restaurant was managed by reputed gambino family associate phillip 
modica prosecutors say

president alfredo cristianis 
acknowledgment that the military was responsible for killing six 
priests at the central american university did not go far enough 
its new rector said monday 
he only confirmed what we have said from the beginning we 
need something more complete said the rev francisco estrada of 
cristianis announcement sunday night 
military and government officials declined to return telephone 
calls seeking elaboration of the presidents admission that 
soldiers were responsible for the nov 16 slayings of six priests 
and educators and two women who lived on the jesuitrun campus 
cristiani in a fiveminute nationwide address did not say who 
has been implicated in the crime or give any idea of their number 
or rank 
the chief of the joint chiefs of staff said sunday night that 47 
members of an elite battalion including two officers were being 
questioned in connection with the slayings but it was still 
unclear monday if those soldiers and officers were the ones 
referred to by cristiani 
the united states on monday praised cristianis announcement 
but to estrada the speech was not relevant 
it is not enough that they the armed forces put forward a 
sergeant the question is who ordered that sergeant to do it 
said estrada who replaced the rev ignacio ellacuria one of those 
murdered as rector 
cristiani said a commission has been created to determine the 
exact circumstances of the slayings and clarify the truth in its 
complete magnitude 
he said investigators would deduce responsibilities and make 
sure justice is done punishment will be meted out down to the 
last person implicated he said 
the slayings of the six priests and educators was one of the 
most heinous political slayings in the decadelong war against the 
leftist rebels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater praised the salvadoran 
investigation and hailed the great courage of cristiani 
we asked the investigation be thorough and the prosecution 
move ahead and it looks like thats the course he is on said 
fitzwater who was traveling with president bush aboard air force 
one to florida 
at the us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
the salvadorans have made this important breakthrough in 
identifying alleged perpetrators but she said prosecution must 
follow 
us authorities have indicated continued support for the 
government against the rebels depended to a great extent on 
punishing those responsible 
no military officer has been convicted of a politically 
motivated slaying since civil war broke out in late 1979 although 
the army was implicated in rightist death squads blamed for the 
murders of thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s 
agents from the united states and spain have aided in the 
investigation scotland yard detectives arrived this weekend and 
began work monday 
col rene emilio ponce head of the joint chiefs of staff said 
earlier by telephone that 47 soldiers from the elite atlacatl 
battalion have been restricted to base but are not under arrest 
ponce said the 47 men being interrogated are members of the unit 
that conducted a search of the jesuits campus residence two days 
before the priests were slain 
asked if the men restricted to bases were implicated by evidence 
other than the fact that they conducted the search ponce declined 
to comment 
a university employee has said she saw men in military uniforms 
outside the residence shortly before the shots that killed the 
priests were heard the woman lucia barrera has been taken for 
her own safety to the united states where she is under the 
protection of the jesuits 
the priests and educators ellacuria ignacio martinbaro 
segundo montes amado lopez juan ramon moreno and joaquin lopez 
lopez were taken from their beds in their on campus residence 
before dawn and killed their housekeeper julia ramos and her 
15yearold daughter celina also were slain 
the slayings took place five days after leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front launched their biggest 
offensive of their 10yearold revolution the guerrillas have 
battled a succession of usbacked governments they say serve as 
civilian facades for repressive military rule 
the far right which is blamed for the deathsquad murders of 
several thousand suspected leftists in the early 1980s had 
consistently denounced the jesuits as subversive ideologues

army faced a military court said a spokesman for the national 
salvation front the provisional government ruling since 
ceausescus ouster 
aurel dragos munteanu the spokesman and director of television 
told a news conference he was unsure how many security men would 
face trial and gave no details of the exact charges in sibiu or 
other centers of heavy fighting such as bucharest and timisoara 
the accused have no right of appeal but media foreign and 
domestic will have access to the tribunals he said 
the national salvation front organized the secret military 
tribunal that ordered the president and his wife elena executed 
on dec 25 
since then it has abolished the death penalty meaning that the 
captured men of crack security units who battled the army after 
ceausescu was ousted face a maximum sentence of life in prison

romanian citizens all romanian citizens older than 14 
irrespective or race nationality sex mother tongue religion 
political beliefs and occupation have the right to travel freely 
abroad rompress said 
under ceausescu romanians had to wait at least three months to 
get a passport which in many cases was not approved elderly 
people were as a rule allowed to travel to the west but younger 
people or couples were denied 
the decree however stipulated that passports can be refused if 
applicants are under prosecution or sentenced to prison or if they 
are known through confirmed facts of being engaged in activities 
that upset public order or commit immoral offense 
romania became the latest former hardline soviet bloc country 
to lift restrictions on its citizens travel to the west east 
germany and czechoslovakia earlier allowed freer travel

that romanias catholic bishops met last week for the first time 
since 1948 to discuss ways of rebuilding their church

a news conference in rome that the meeting was attended by 
archbishop francesco colasuonno pope john paul iis special envoy

a top official and 8 others from the 
usbacked contra guerrillas on monday ended their armed fight 
against the leftist sandinista government to return home and take 
part in the electoral process 
it was the first contra group to return to nicaragua under the 
auspices of a united nationsorganization of american states 
committee charged with supervising demobilization of the rebel 
force 
luis fley a longtime official at the rebels honduras office 
said the group decided to return as an expression of support for 
the central american peace process and to contribute to the 
process of national reconciliation 
the unoas committee was established under the terms of accords 
reached by central american presidents calling for demobilization 
of the contras in exchange for fair elections in nicaragua contras 
who want to take part in elections scheduled for feb 25 must 
return to nicaragua by feb 5 
other nicaraguans mostly civilians have returned under a 
different amnesty program 
fley 39 was an attorney for the contras and a top official at 
the contra office in tegucigalpa honduras he was better known by 
his nom de guerre commander johnson and for a time controlled 
journalists access to the border camps in honduras where the 
contra army is based 
the central american accords guarantee returnees civil and 
political rights asked if he felt safe in returning fley told 
reporters i think so 
in a scene showing how war can split relatives fley was met by 
his family including two brothers who are officers in the 
sandinista army capt francisco fley 32 and lt jorge fley 29 
a third brother enrique fley was killed two years ago at age 
28 in a contra ambush 
the contras have been fighting to topple the sandinista 
government with us support and fley said the conditions that 
caused the war have not been solved despite the accords 
the causes of the war have not disappeared because conditions 
of liberty justice and democracy do not yet exist said fley 
reading a statement during his arrival at managuas airport 
the nine arrived on a commercial flight and were met by un and 
oas representatives the nicaraguan ambassador in honduras 
francisco lacayo and by commander luis guzman of the interior 
ministry 
fley and the others negotiated for their return with guzman the 
international representatives and lacayo guzman was sent to 
honduras specifically for the negotiations 
most of the group did not have major information about the 
tela accords and the guarantees included in them guzman said 
undoubtedly on the part of the contra leaders there has been no 
intention of letting their members know about the extent of the 
accords 
guzman said there were talks now taking place for more contras 
to return to civilian life in nicaragua 
a document given fley and the others spells out a series of 
guarantees their constitutional rights are restored they can 
resettle anywhere and can move throughout the country without any 
hindrance they have a right to a passport and to travel outside 
the country without restrictions they can join the political party 
of their choice and will not be prosecuted for any past political 
or military activity 
un representative werner blatter of switzerland said the unoas 
committee is charged with keeping track of those who return for 
any problem that could arise

a band that wants the accordion designated 
the citys official instrument says the humble pleated bellows is 
as much a part of the city history as earthquakes clipper ships 
and cable cars 
players with those darn accordions revival band planned to 
serenade the mayor outside city hall on monday as the city 
considers a proposal to proclaim the music box the official 
instrument of san francisco 
there should be an official city instrument because we have 
official city songs and we need an instrument to play them on it 
should be the accordion because of its rich history here and 
because it was invented here said tom torriglia a band member 
leading the effort for official recognition 
the 13member band whose repertoire includes volare 
hernandos hideaway and the godfather theme planned to 
plaaour lady of spain beneath mayor art agnos window while 
san francisco supervisor willie kennedy introduced a proposal 
giving official status to the instrument 
mayor agnos may be greek but he is first and foremost a san 
franciscan said torriglia a freelance publicist andotertainment 
reviewer 
despite the lyrical claim of the starship band that it built 
this city on rock n roll torriglia said the accordion more 
than the guitar the piano or even the beatnik bongos of the 1950s 
deserves the official nod 
classical musicians still harkened back to european traditions 
in 1907 when italian immigrants by the name of pietro deiro and 
colombo piatenesi fitted an old button accordion with a vertical 
piano keyboard and created the piano accordion that became as 
common at italian family picnics as the vino said accordion 
historian ron flynn of san franciscov 
the chinese inventors of the musical reed originated the 
principles of the accordion whichpwrsqbs recreated by germans and 
italians said flynn in the 1800s piano keys were added on the 
right with cords and tones played on buttons on the left deiros 
improvement on that design spawned an accordion industry in san 
francisco that in its 1920s heyday included eight accordion 
manufacturing firms and teachers famed nationwide and in europe 
few remnants of that era remain said torriglia who blames the 
british rock n roll invasion and schmaltzy lawrence welk with 
the waning popularity of the accordion 
the instrument remains a favorite in chicagos immigrant 
communities with cajun and brazilian bands and in other regions 
flynn said but in the san francisco bay area the colombo amp sons 
repair shop in marin county is one of the few remaining descendants 
of the days when the renowned guerrini accordion co flourished in 
the heart of san franciscos north beach neighborhood 
torriglia says the umpah umpah sound of the accordion 
pushing wind through its vibrating reeds is an expressive sound 
that enables him to convey his most passionate emotions 
besides he said the accordion is part of a tradition even 
older than italian picnics or chinese ingenuity its a good way 
to meet girls

the kremlins ideology chief told lithuanian 
communists on monday their break with moscow is a blow to president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reform program at its most critical moment 
vadim a medvedev a member of the ruling politburo made the 
comment as he laid the groundwork for a trip to lithuania this week 
by gorbachev a visit that will test gorbachevs ability to end one 
of the worst political crises of his nearly fiveyear tenure 
violence along the sovietiranian border meanwhile was reported 
to have reignited and spread to an area that also is close to 
turkey soviet azerbaijani protesters reportedly destroyed more 
border posts 
medvedev told communists and workers at a factory in vilnius 
the capital of lithuania that their partys decision dec 20 to 
declare independence from the national party has effects on the 
problems of interethnic relations and nationalstate structure and 
economic reforms tass said 
in a dispatch paraphrasing him the official news agency did not 
say how economic reforms would be damaged 
the decisions made by the 20th congress of the lithuanian 
communist party are a blow to the soviet communist partys unity 
to the construction of a revitalized federation and to all of 
perestroika tass said paraphrasing medvedev 
the decision is seen as a possible precursor to secession by the 
baltic republic of 37 million people 
the kremlin is clearly extremely concerned over the prospect 
that the entire soviet federation could break apart if other 
republics follow lithuanias move 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev said in an interview 
monday with interfax a news service of radio moscow the 
lithuanian move might cause a domino effect implying that 
communists in the 14 other republics might also break from moscow 
medvedev said the split cuts off lithuanians from democratic 
processes throughout the country and cannot be assessed otherwise 
but as an expression of noconfidence in the soviet communist party 
and its course for perestroika as a blow to perestroika at the 
most critical time of its development 
in remarks carried by soviet tv he asked lithuanian communists 
to compromise saying nobody is against independence but let 
this be together with the soviet communist party 
we have to unite then we will have nothing to fear 
gorbachev is expected to arrive in vilnius on wednesday and 
spend three days trying to persuade the lithuanians to return to 
the fold the lithuanian grassroots movement sajudis is calling for 
a giant demonstration during the visit show the peoples 
determination to pursue independence 
gorbachev has blasted the split saying the communists were 
giving in to separatists leaders of the breakaway party who 
met with him in moscow last week said however he promised not to 
interfere if they stuck with their decision 
the government daily izvestia said monday that azerbaijani 
protesters destroyed border posts at ilichevsk continuing a wave 
of unrest that began dec 31 protesters demanding to cross the 
aras river which borders iran confronted guards who set up 
armored personnel carriers and trucks to blockade a bridge but the 
guards retreated to avoid bloodletting izvestia said 
after the protesters passed through they destroyed the border 
posts so that the frontier of azerbaijans nakhichevan region with 
iran is without defenses according to the newspaper 
thousands of protesters demanding open borders and unification 
with their ethnic brethren in iran have destroyed guard observation 
towers electronic alarms and communications lines along the border 
elsewhere in azerbaijan tass said sabotage hostagetaking and 
sniper fire continued in the disputed nagornokarabakh district a 
highway bridge between agdam and askeran was blown up thursday and 
four days later an explosion damaged a railway bridge near agdam 
forcing suspension of traffic 
strikes and violence have torn the mountainous nagornokarabakh 
territory for two years as majority armenians fight azerbaijanis 
for control

prodemocracy groups forced early adjournment 
monday of weekly talks with the communist party on east germanys 
future demanding proof that the hated secret police were being 
disbanded as promised 
about 100000 reformers rallied at leipzig in the first of its 
regular monday evening demonstrations after a threeweek break 
as at previous leipzig demonstrations the crowd was divided 
between those favoring reunification with west germany and those 
opposed rally sponsors canceled the usual speeches to prevent a 
confrontation on the issue 
in the crowd were banners with such slogans as down with the 
sed the socialist unity party the communists formal name 
and gysi out a reference to party chairman gregor gysi 
about 50000 people rallied at karlmarxstadt and thousands 
demonstrated in schwerin halle neubrandenburg and cottbus said 
adn the official news agency 
adn said the first indictments against 30 former top communists 
were expected next month and more investigations would be completed 
in march and april 
a nearfrenzy against corruption and abuse of power has 
developed since erich honecker the 77yearold stalinist party 
chief was deposed in october after 18 years in power 
the agency said it could not predict when charges could be 
expected against honecker who also is the object of a criminal 
investigation but it denied there was any intentional delay in 
pursuing his case 
honecker is hospitalized the agency reported but it did not 
say where last week adn said he had a malignant kidney tumor 
mondays confrontation illustrated the wariness with which 
reformers regard the transitional government of hans modrow the 
communist premier 
two major opposition groups including the largest new forum 
have threatened to leave the talks because of what they call 
government efforts to preserve the secret police failure of the 
talks could set the stage for new political turmoil 
a majority of delegates supported a motion by new forum to end 
the monday session an hour early and block consideration of other 
topics until officials provide details on the dissolution of the 
oncefeared secret police 
delegates demanded unanimously that the government submit a 
report about internal security at the meeting jan 15

art buchwald won his lawsuit against 
paramount pictures on monday when a judge ruled the humorists 
original script idea was the basis for eddie murphys box office 
bonanza coming to america 
superior court judge harvey schneiders decision means paramount 
will have to pay buchwald a share of profits from the film which 
has grossed more than 300 million since its 1988 release 
buchwald a pulitzer prizewinning columnist filed a 5 million 
suit against paramount a year ago claim9nlsqb the studio breached a 
1983 contract to purchase his script idea 
a second accounting of the trial will examine profits on 
coming to america and determine the plaintiffs share 
the court oncludes that coming to america is a movie that 
was based upon buchwalds treatment king for a day schneider 
said in a 34page written ruling 
buchwald called the decision a victory for writers everywhere 
i am very very happy this thing is not only an important 
thing for me i think its really important for writers he said 
in a telephone interview from washington 
i didnwtknow what i was getting into when i started because 
those guys play rough and we beat them and that makes me very 
happy buchwald said i doubt if int to get involved with 
hollywood for some time 
paramount issued a statement saying it would appeal mondays 
ruling 
gwe dont think theres any similarity between these two works 
its like godzilla and cinderella said paramount attorney 
robert draper the only similarity is that both of the 
characters in the buchwald and murphy scripts are black we think 
that the law is clear on it and we think that the evidence that 
came in on it was clear and we intend to present that to the 
appellate court 
buchwald attorney pierce odonnell suggested the accounting 
phase of the trial would take the lid off hollywood creative 
financing paramount claims coming to america with its gross 
profits over 300 million has shown no net profits 
if you believe that quipped buchwald then theres a 
wonderful sampl id like to sell you 
odonnell said buchwald and buchwalds partner producer alain 
bernheim could collect between 5 million to 10 million as their 
share of the films net profits and called the decision a victory 
for hollywoods creative community 
ive never seen such a decisive victory for a writer he 
said its a landmark decision 
i am delighted that the little man kicked the big guy added 
billy wilder a buchwald ally the director and cowriter of 
paramounts 1950 classic sunset boulevard and a frequent 
visitor to the courtroom during the trial 
schneider emphasized that his decision was not intended to 
disparage the creative talent of eddie murphy who said he wrote 
the script 
the court desires to indicate what this cake is and is not 
about the judge said it is not about whether art buchwald or 
eddie murphy is more creative it is clear to the court that each 
of these men is a creative genius in his own field and each is a 
uniquely american institution 
schneider stressed that buchwalds contract dispute was with 
paramount not murphy 
murphy costar arsenio hall testified at the trial that he and 
murphy independently conceived the idea for coming to america 
schneider found that buchwalds idea and murphy movie were 
substantially similar 
buchwalds 1982 script synopsis optioned by paramount involved a 
young member of royalty frompmythical african kingdom who comes 
to the united states and is deposed in his absence he winds up in 
a washington ghetto working in a fast food restaurant where he 
meets and marries a young black woman 
in murphys movie a prince from a mythical african kingdom 
comes to new york in search of a bride winds up in a ghetto 
working in a fast food restaurant meets a young black woman and 
marries her

terrythomas the consummate upperclass rotter in 
dozens of film comedies including its a mad mad mad mad 
world died monday at age 78 after a long battle with 
parkinsons disease 
the actor whose trademarks were a gap between his upper front 
teeth a wellbrushed mustache and a long cigarette holder died at 
a nursing home in godalming surrey according to the parkinsons 
disease society 
on screen he was a terrific cad he was the ultimate cad 
said actor nigel havers 
he was the last of the great gentlemen on the cinema along 
with in my experience people like fred astaire and david niven 
said lionel jeffries who appeared with terrythomas in rocket to 
the moon in 1967 
terrythomas had been diagnosed as having the degenerative 
muscle disease in 1971 and had not appeared in films since the 
hound of the baskervilles in 1978 
the cost of his care eventually forced him to sell his luxurious 
home on the mediterranean island of ibiza in london he lived in 
an apartment provided by a charity 
the star of films including im all right jack and its a 
mad mad mad mad world had been too ill to attend a benefit in 
his honor in london last april which raised 51000 for his care 
in films terrythomas was often the upperclass cad or silly 
ass murmuring jolly good show as in his role as sir percy in 
those magnificent men in their flying machines 
he once denied that he was typically english 
that makes me a bit of a sham i suppose because as you know i 
have made all my money or most of it anyway by sending up pompous 
englishmen he said 
he was born thomas terry hoar stevens on july 14 1911 and took 
his first two names for stage use until too many people thought he 
was related to actress ellen terry 
he got his start in the theater in an amateur dramatic society 
associated with the union cold storage co where he was a meat 
salesman even then his appearance was splendid a cigarette 
holder a silvertopped malacca cane suede shoes and yellow 
leather gloves were part of the ensemble 
i felt that my impeccable appearance more than compensated for 
my habitual late arrival at the office he wrote in his book 
filling the gap 
his first film appearance was in helter skelter in 1949 
terrythomas career took off in 1956 with the role of a 
commanding officer in the farce privates progress which 
required him to handle such lines as youre an absolute shower 
he appeared in the green man the same year and then in 1957 
teamed with ian carmichael in brothers in law and lucky jim 
in 1958 he appeared with peter sellers in tom thumb for mgm 
and in the british spoof carlton brown at the fo 
terrythomas played the fatuous factory personnel manager to 
sellers communist shop steward in im all right jack in 1959 
terrythomas first marriage to ballet dancer ida patlanski 
ended in divorce in 1962 
a year later he married belinda cunningham who was 27 years 
younger and they had two sons tiger and cushan 
in an interview in 1984 terrythomas was resigned about his 
illness 
its no good asking why this had to happen to me he said 
there arent any answers the only thing we know definitely is 
that things get worse there is no way of improving you ask me how 
it feels there is a whole plethora of symptoms now i have said 
that other times i cannot say the simplest possible word like 
lavatory paper 
he is survived his wife and his two sons

the federal aviation administration said 
monday it intends to revise safety requirements for infants and 
toddlers traveling on airliners but is not sure what form the rule 
will take 
faa administator james busey said the agencys eventual action 
which could be two years away may mean that adults traveling with 
children under age 2 will have to buy tickets for the youngsters 
and perhaps have them secured in faaapproved child seats 
current faa quidelines allow a child under age 2 to ride for 
free on an adults lap 
busey asked if the revised requirements would disallow that 
practice replied we want to know what the public wants 
thats part of the problem 
he also told reporters at a transportation convention i cant 
make a rule that requires the airlines to provide free seats 
if transportation secretary elizabeth dole approves the faa 
proposal to write rules for the airlines youngest passengers a 
formal notice will be printed in the federal register 
the public will then have 90 days to comment an faa spokesman 
said hearings may be held 
a representative of the association of flight attendants which 
strongly supports putting children under age 2 in some sort of 
restraints commented after buseys announcement that its 
ludicrous that there are faa regulations in place to restrain 
carryon baggage while babies are allowed to fly around the cabin 
during a crash 
nancy gilmer air safety coordinator for the association 
praised the faa for moving quickly on efforts to improve safety for 
small children and said many parents dont understand the problem 
of unrestrained youngsters 
its not unusual to be getting ready to take off and some 
little kid is running down the aisle she said as a flight 
attendant its something you learn to deal with 
a spokeswoman for usair said the airline is neutral on the 
subject of toughened safety requirements for small children 
spokeswoman susan young said a majority of parents traveling 
with children under age 2 carry them on the adults laps although 
some parents bring their own carriers and buy tickets for their 
children 
interest in airliner child restraints rose after the july 19 
crash of united airlines flight 232 at sioux city iowa 
five children under age 2 were traveling on adults laps one 
was a 23monthold boy who died after his mother lost her grip as 
the plane cartwheeled across a runway split apart and burst into 
flames the child died of smoke inhalation 
busey also said told reporters that within 18 months the public 
can expect to see airport security devices that will detect plastic 
explosives 
the technology to detect such explosives exists and is in use 
for baggage checked into airliner cargo space at john f kennedy 
international airport in new york and will soon be installed in 
miami 
he said that the equipment is still too cumbersome to be used 
for carryon luggage but that the devices are becoming smaller and 
soon will be standard equipment in all airports

representatives of the un security councils five 
permanent members will meet in paris next week to consider ways of 
bringing peace to cambodia diplomatic sources said monday 
they said the twoday talks would focus on an australian 
proposal to replace cambodias communist government with a un 
administration until formation of a new government after free 
elections 
deputy foreign ministers of the united states soviet union 
china britain and france are to participate in the paris meeting 
jan 1516 the diplomats said speaking on condition of anonymity 
michael costello australias deputy foreign minister met with 
premier hun sen of cambodia on monday about the proposal the 
official cambodian news agency spk said they met in an eastern 
province of cambodia and agreed to the idea of involving the 
united nations in an interim administration 
guerrilla attacks in western cambodia have increased 
international pressure to find ways of preventing a return to power 
by the khmer rouge who conducted a reign of terror from the end of 
the indochina war in 1975 until the vietnamese invasion of cambodia 
in december 1978 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said talks among the five countries would take place in the near 
future but would not confirm the date or place 
reports of steppedup military activity by the khmer rouge 
underscore the need to move quickly toward a diplomatic solution 
she said we believe that a comprehensive settlement is thae best 
way to ensure that the khmer rouge do not enhance their influence 
in cambodia by means of force 
the khmer rouge is allied with two noncommunist resistance 
groups backed by the united states in a coalition led by prince 
norodom sihanouk cambodias former ruler they are fighting the 
hun sen government which vietnam sponsors 
vietnam says it completed withdrawing its occupation army from 
cambodia at the end of september 
in an intrerview broadcast by cambodian state radio sunday the 
defense minister acknowledged guerrilla advances in western areas 
near the thai border and said his forces had left some positions 
to concentrate defenses on major towns and roads 
the enemies have been gradually advancing in their attacks 
against a number of our positions along the border gen tea banh 
said we have lost some positions we cannot stay in every 
village we have to abandon some and keep some strategic ones 
peace efforts notably an international conference last summer 
in paris have failed in large part because the hun sen government 
refuses to include the khmer rouge in an allparty interim 
administration 
sihanouk argues that excluding the khmer rouge the strongest 
guerrilla group would only ensure continued fighting 
australia suggests about 200 administrators be sent to govern 
cambodia supported by a 7000member peacekeeping force the khmer 
rouge has ignored the australian proposal 
on jan 3 sihanouk said he would agree to an interim un 
administration and vacate the cambodian seat at the united nations 
which the guerrilla alliance holds if the existing government was 
dismantled at the same time 
the australian plan cannot be put into effect without the 
approval of all five permanent members of the security council

a researcher who met with manuel antonio 
noriega last year says noriega told him the united states began 
its campaign to remove me after he refused to allow panama to be 
used as a base for the usbacked nicaraguan contra rebels 
saul landau a senior fellow at the institute for policy 
studies a washington think tank said noriega told him last fall 
that john poindexter president reagans national security adviser 
visited panama in 1985 seeking noriegas support for the contras 
poindexter came to see me about what he said was a very urgent 
matter landau in a report in the februarymarch issue of mother 
jones magazine quoted noriega as saying 
according to landaus account in mother jones which provided an 
advance copy of the article to the associated press noriega 
continued 
the admiral wanted to use panamanian territory to train and 
launch contra against nicaragua i explained to him why we could 
not become a launching pad for the contra without causing 
turbulence in the region i explained to him that if panama assumed 
such a role in the area it would not help but rather hurt us 
interests 
noriega according to landau said poindexter was visibly 
angered by noriegas refusal 
poindexter grew quite indignant right in my office landau 
quoted noriega as saying he took out his pipe and banged it on 
the table im not sure if he broke it after that incident the 
united states began its campaign to remove me 
landau said he spoke to noriega at a reception during a seminar 
noriega had organized on us intervention in third world countries 
noriega who surrendered to us authorities last week after 
evading caputure during the us invasion of panama is being held 
in florida on drugrelated charges 
poindexter is scheduled to stand trial later this month on 
charges stemming from his role in the irancontra scandal his 
attorney did not immediately return a telephone message left monday 
by the ap 
the statements attributed to noriega by landau are similar to an 
account noriega gave in february 1988 on the cbstv program 60 
minutes 
in that interview noriega said he met with poindexter on dec 
17 1985 and refused a reagan administration request that panama 
be used as a training ground for the contra rebels trying to 
overthrow nicaraguas sandinista government 
noriega told 60 minutes that poindexter told him the united 
states would harm panama politically and economically if the 
request was turned down 
in a speech days before that interview noriega said that 
poindexter had asked him for unspecified cooperation in central 
america and that when he refused poindexter told him to expect 
the consequences in the speech noriega said he considered his 
indictment on the drug charges the consequence

the computer tampering trial of an ivy 
league student accused of crippling thousands of computers 
nationwide opened monday with jury selection and federal 
prosecutors seeking to limit defense evidence 
opening arguments were to begin tuesday morning in the us 
district court trial of robert t morris jr a 24yearold 
suspended cornell university graduate student 
the arnold md man is the first person to come to trial under 
the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act if convicted he faces up to 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine 
morris is accused of designing and setting loose a socalled 
worm program that replicated wildly immobilizing an estimated 
6000 computers linked to the internet research computer network 
including those at air force and national aeronautics and space 
administration facilities 
in a motion filed monday justice department lawyers sought to 
hinder morris expected defense that he did not intend to paralyze 
the computer network by allegedly introducing a rogue program into 
it on nov 2 1988 
the prosecutors asked judge howard munson to limit examination 
of witnesses on morris state of mind specifically whether it was 
his intent to prevent authorized use of internet and to cause any 
loss or damage to the system 
the evidence of lack of intent to cause loss or lack of 
intent to prevent the authorized use of the victim computers 
however is simply not relevant to any issue in this case the 
motion said 
munson did not immediately rule on the motion but when defense 
attorney thomas guidoboni raised the question of intent in a 
pretrial motion to have morris indictment dismissed munson 
rejected the argument that the defendants intentions were 
pertinent to the indictments legality 
guidoboni contends the law is unclear as to whether criminal 
intent means intent to cause damage or simply intent to gain access 
to computer systems 
justice department attorneys ellen r meltzer and mark d rasch 
declined to comment on their own motion outside the courtroom 
the first 10 potential jurors questioned from a pool of 93 were 
dismissed due to objections by munson or lawyers but all parties 
were able to agree on the next 12 candidates finishing jury 
selection in less than three hours 
morris who was a firstyear doctoral student in computer 
studies before his suspension sat attentively as lawyers 
questioned potential jurors his father robert t morris sr 
chief scientist at the national computer security center in 
bethesda md and mother also attended 
prosecutors also asked the court to allow witnesses to explain 
what the worm program was designed to do 
evidence that morris designed earlier versions of the computer 
virus are relevant to the charges the government said in its 
motion the earlier versions were not launched 
the trial is expected to last about two weeks the government 
presented the court with a potential list of about 20 witnesses 
and guidoboni named at least four witnesses in court 
a cornell university commission concluded that morris was guilty 
of reckless disregard for creating the program although the 
university commission found him responsible morris has never 
publicly admitted creating the worm program or introducing it into 
internet

leaders of the communist party 
opposition and ethnic groups united in appealing monday for an end 
to protests and strikes over the decision to restore rights to 
bulgarias ethnic turks 
consultations about settling the ethnic dispute began monday and 
will continue all week the official news agency bta reported 
politburo member mincho yovchev said unrest over the 
decision dec 29 to restore religious rights to 12 million 
ethnic turks and withdraw the requirement that they take bulgarian 
names had created the first serious crisis since reforms began 
two months ago 
petar mladenov who replaced todor zhivkov as party chief nov 
10 and ended 35 years of stalinist rule defended the policy 
reversal in a meeting with slav nationalists 
he told leaders of the council for the defense of national 
interests that the 1984 decisions restricting the rights of ethnic 
turks most of whom are moslems were very grave errors bta 
reported 
one result of these errors has been bulgarias complete 
international isolation mladenov said and the only way out of 
that situation was to restore the constitutional rights of all 
citizens the agency reported 
yovchev a deputy premier said the wounds inflicted on 
bulgarian society as a whole by zhivkovs persecution of ethnic 
turks turned out to be much more serious than we assumed 
after zhivkov granted passports last may 325000 ethnic turks 
fled bulgaria for turkey about 96000 have returned complaining 
of poor housing and lack of jobs 
pressed for time we were unable to accompany our decision in 
principle dec 29 with a comprehensive program on the ethnic 
issue he said in a television interview 
his comments reflected the predicament of a leadership caught 
between demands by the ethnic turkish minority for rights and 
protests by tens of thousands of slav nationalists against 
concessions 
different forces take advantage of this to discredit the new 
leadership of the bulgarian communist party and the state and the 
politburo is seeking a practical solution to the ethnic 
problem yovchev said he and others have hinted that zhivkov 
loyalists incited ethnic unrest 
foreign minister boiko dimitrov of bulgaria and the turkish 
foreign minister mesut yilmaz are to discuss the problem at a 
meeting tuesday in kuwait 
at mondays meeting of delegates from all groups concerned with 
the ethnic conflict trade union official krasniu petkov urged that 
demonstrations and strikes cease during this week of dialogue 
bta reported 
petkov said all participants in the talks at the national 
assembly supported petkov 
about 200 people demonstrated in front of the parliament 
building demanding the restrictions on ethnic turks continue they 
displayed placards with such nationalist slogans as one people 
one language one flag 
nationalists have expressed fear their own culture would at one 
time be overshadowed by that of the turks whose birth rate is 
increasing as that of slavs declines 
mistrust of turks has lingered in bulgaria since 500 years of 
occupation by the ottoman empire ended a century ago 
nationalist demonstrators deny prozhivkov elements are behind 
the protests 
i am sure local party officials have had nothing to do with 
this movement nelli dimitrova a 22yearold university student 
told an associated press reporter outside parliament 
viktor orlinov said in contrast that demonstrators from 
southern provinces told him communist party officials paid their 
fares to the capital orlinov is an ethnic turk who works for state 
television in sofia 
the old apparatus of zhivkov is still dangerous for turks 
and party officials in the south where many of the ethnic turks 
live are much more conservative and chauvinistic than those in 
the capital he in a cafe 
demonstrations against turkish rights have been held in sofia 
and at least seven other cities

the bush administration said publicly monday 
it was not planning a naval blockade off colombia as part of its 
fight against drug trafficking and the colombian government said 
it had received private assurances as well 
a statement issued by the colombian embassy said the united 
states had said it would not interfere with colombian flag ships 
even on the high seas without the permission of colombian defense 
ministry 
other colombian officials had accused the united states of 
moving toward a naval and air blockade generating some confusion 
over the weekend as to the respective positions of the two 
governments 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration is considering use of the navy but she said a 
blockade is not among the options 
a blockade would mean shutting down everything and that 
obviously is not our intention she said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater traveling with president 
bush on a trip to orlando fla said that two us ships had left 
port and were on maneuvers in the atlantic but that future 
deployment near colombia would depend on talks with the barco 
government he said no agreement had been reached in preliminary 
discussions and praised the colombian government for prior 
cooperation 
dismissing the significance of suggestions that colombia would 
reject a us naval role off its coast fitzwater said i think 
the problem is we havent had a chance here to really explore it 
with them he said the united states was not taking blocking 
action now 
meanwhile pentagon spokesman pete williams said defense 
secretary dick cheney plans to unveil the administrations plans 
for military involvement in the antidrug battle next week 
bush has looked at sending us warships off the colombian coast 
to help monitor and interdict narcotics traffickers pentagon 
sources have said 
the aircraft carrier uss john f kennedy has been chosen to lead 
such an effort if the white house gives the signal to move forward 
the sources have said however it has been unclear whether 
colombia will agree to the plan 
the state department spokeswoman said there have been no more 
than low level consultations on the subject of increased us 
efforts in the area thus far with colombian officials 
ms tutwiler said that no interdiction effort will be carried 
out without full consultations with other governments which may be 
affected by such activity 
williams asked about reports that two us warships were on 
their way to colombia to lead an antidrug interdiction effort 
said the uss john f kennedy and guided missile cruiser uss 
virginia were on routine training exercises 
he said he could not discuss any future operations the vessels 
may be called upon to undertake

prices on the buenos aires stock 
exchange plunged an average of 53 percent in value monday when the 
market in economically wracked argentina reopened for the first 
time in more than a week 
meanwhile the government said inflation in december soared 40 
percent bringing the official 1989 rise in the cost of living to a 
record 4923 percent 
the two figures bode poorly for the government of president 
carlos menem which is implementing its fourth austerity plan since 
menem came to office in july and promised to sell off inefficient 
stateowned industries cut the burdensome budget deficit and 
steady the national currency 
but the austral the national currency slipped monday against 
the us dollar to 16501 down from 14001 last friday the 
austral which replaced the inflated peso traded at parity with 
the us dollar when the government of president raul alfonsin 
introduced it in 1986 
the sudden devaluation of the austral two weeks ago ignited the 
latest price hikes of 100 percent and more in most supermarket and 
department stores last february the austral traded at 171 
january inflation is expected to be at least 40 percent also 
said moises iconikoff planning secretary at the economy ministry 
analysts said the fall in stock prices the steepest in 
percentage since 1949 for the exchanges 16 major companies was in 
part because of the shortage of australs in circulation 
last week the governments latest economic team decreed a 
cutback in the amount of australs it would allow to be printed to 
reduce supplies of the national currency and force up the value of 
the austral 
economic indicators however continue to deteriorate real wages

put their earnings in dollars a traditional haven for argentines

comecon seemingly left behind by the 
reforms in eastern europe will face radical changes when its 
leaders meet here tuesday in a bid to save the sovietdominated 
trading bloc from disintegration 
the twoday conference of the 10nation organization which 
includes the seven soviet bloc countries cuba mongolia and 
vietnam is the first after last months ouster of romanian 
dictator nicolae ceausescu and the decline of communist power 
elsewhere in europe 
founded in 1949 comecon the council for mutual economic 
assistance aimed to ensure the marxist members economic growth 
so they could match or even outshine the west 
but 41 years later comecon largely because of the unwieldiness 
of central planning and the absence of profitbased 
enterpreneurship and vision needs a radical overhaul or it will 
crumble 
critics say comecon is nowadays nothing more than a means for 
its member states to survive the freemarket evils of an 
increasin7le competitive world economic system 
the bloc isnt held together by socialist solidarity they say 
but by eastern europoai countries inability to earn enough hard 
currency to buy energy and raw materials from anywhere but the 
soviet union 
czechoslovakia and romania have now closed ranks with hungarys 
reformers and polands solidarityled government which have called 
for an end to trade based on fixed quotas and prices barter and a 
nonchnvertible currency the soviet ruble 
comecon is an obsolete organization it has never worked and 
doesnt work now romanias interim premier petre roman said 
monday comecon must adjust and change if it is to continue 
roman is to lead the romanian delegation in sofia 
czechoslovakias new finance minister vaclav klaus warned last 
thursday that his country would unilaterally cancel its comecon 
commitments if radical changes werent made to the nonconvertible 
payments system 
according to hungarys deputy premier peter medgyessy comecon 
organized under the myth of friendship and brotherhood is no 
longer capable of serving either the developoment of its members or 
the integration of the central and eastern european region 
in an interview published monday with the hungarian government 
daily magyar hirlap medgyessy said comecon was born and has been a 
preserved as a result of a divided europe 
its archaic system has removed its members from the tide of 
the world economy he was quoted as saying 
hungary in an attempt to slash its trade surplus with the 
soviet union announced last week it would cut its exports to the 
soviet union by 20 percent 
medgyessy said barter of soviet energy for eastern european 
goods and farm produce at prenegotiated prices paralyzed 
competition slowed technological advances and caused consumer 
goods shortages in some member states 
hungary has already proposed to trade with the soviets on a 
dollar basis rather than on a rubleonly basis 
czechoslovakia and poland last week already decided to establish 
bilateral trade agreements and link their currencies the koruna 
and zloty bypassing the ruble 
hungary envisages an initial integration of polish czechoslovak 
and hungarian economies within the bloc because they are similar in 
size and economic development 
medgyessy said free trade agreements should lead to joint trade 
policies free flow of labor and capital the harmonization of 
financial systems and the creation of a fully convertible currency 
unit 
similar steps are being taken by the european economic 
community which plans to unite 12 western economies in a single 
european market after 1992 
although comecon and the ec established official relations in 
1988 brussels still doesnt recognize the moscowbased 
organization as its equal because comecon has no lawmaking body 
like the communitys european parliament empowered to adopt policy 
for member states 
meanwhile comecon secretary vyacheslav sychov said the trading 
bloc should push for more freedom for individual members to trade 
outside comecon and for it to seek closer relations with the ec

foreign aid often has been a political 
headache rather than a plus because the recipients arent american 
voters but the politics of the issue may be changing with the tide 
of democracy in eastern europe 
democrats are likely to push for an expanded program of us aid 
to the fledgling governments and free market economies behind the 
fallen iron curtain theyve been complaining that the bush 
administration is too timid and too stingy on that front 
aid to promote democratic reform is a bargain they argue 
compared with the 160 billion a year the united states has been 
spending on the defense of western europe 
there are calls now for a new sort of marshall plan to be 
organized in cooperation with us allies to assist the nations 
that used to be soviet satellites 
there are no numbers and no details to go with the idea of a 
western combine to provide economic aid to the east perhaps 
including the soviet union itself but the proposal could become a 
focus of the 1990 debate on the american response to the peaceful 
changes that swept the old soviet bloc toward political 
competition and free market systems in place of communist control 
the complaints about administration timidity will be heard again 
unless president bush forecloses them with a more dramatic aid and 
economic development plan of his own 
this years aid program provides 533 million for poland and 
hungary in cash to stabilize currencies and support moves toward 
private enterprise and in insurance to promote trade and 
investments that is the first installment in a 938 million 
threeyear aid package most of it for poland hungary is to 
receive aid valued at 915 million 
when he signed the package late last year bush said dollars 
alone wont make the difference 
at the same time the president has promised that eastern 
european countries moving to overhaul their political and economic 
systems can anticipate american help 
direct us aid adds to the budget pressure that confronts both 
the white house and congress theres no new money around defense 
outlays may ease but any peace dividend will come gradually not 
immediately shifting the old aid money in new directions would 
involve reductions in aid to israel and that could mean trouble 
with some influential interest groups and contributors especially 
for democrats with big jewish constituencies 
democrats arent alone in arguing that the united states should 
be doing more 
to prescribe an economic policy toward the soviet bloc in 
present circumstances is admittedly difficult but we are clearly 
going in the wrong direction says economist herbert stein a 
veteran of republican administrations and a senior fellow at the 
american enterprise institute 
on the one hand we are becoming increasingly willing to sell 
hightech equipment to a soviet union that is continuing to produce 
armaments while the soviet people are without soap he writes in 
the institutes new magazine the american enterprise 
on the other hand we are niggardly in thinking of the 
possibilities of assisting the countries notably poland and 
hungary that show signs of moving in directions we could live with 
more securely stein says 
he proposes that the united states western european nations and 
japan cooperate to set a common economic policy toward the old 
soviet bloc 
the policy should minimize our contribution to their military 
power while assisting actual movement within bloc countries toward 
more consumeroriented economies more democracy and a 
lessaggressive foreign policy stein says 
the ripon society an organization of moderate and liberal 
republicans recommends the creation of something called a free 
world fund collected from free world nations in proportion to the 
size of their economies to promote and finance western goals that 
would include some military expenditures along with joint foreign 
aid to emerging eastern european democracies and to developing 
nations elsewhere

questions sometimes may be more pertinent than 
replies in the world of business finance and economics partly 
because some of the socalled answers are so flawed they invite 
even more questions 
why has housing remained so strong 
sales of new homes rose 96 percent in november the biggest 
gain in four months the gains came right at a time when economists 
were talking about a sluggish economy the possibility of recession 
and buyer uncertainty 
moreover in spite of a lot of talk about lower prices the 
median price has risen and interest rates although recently lower 
remain higher than they were several years ago in addition there 
is supposed to be an affordability gap 
why hasnt the jobless rate risen 
at 53 percent it remains relatively low compared with rates of 
the past decade or more but shouldnt it be rising economists say 
the nations output is slowing and layoffs have become a regular 
thing in the automotive industry 
one possible explanation is demographic that the country is 
running low on young replacement workers another is that a lot of 
people who could work arent actively looking for work and so 
arent officially in the labor force 
and of course the possibility exists that the numbers for 
december will show an increase some economists contend that 
jobless statistics seldom foretell recession that in that sense 
theyre a lagging indicator 
why havent those continued budget deficits caused a borrowing 
crisis 
it was a very popular argument just a decade ago that continued 
budget deficits were draining the pool of available funds and that 
there wouldnt be enough left for business and consumers forcing 
interest rates higher 
the deficits have continued of course but so has the 
borrowing a report from the conference board a privatesector 
researcher states that the us private sector is accumulating 
debt faster than it is acquiring assets 
among nonfinancial corporations the board said liabilities 
totaled 27 trillion at the end of 1988 up 111 percent since the 
decade of the 1980s began but interest rates came down from 
stratospheric heights in that time 
the most likely explanation for the decline is the inflow of 
foreign money a factor that wasnt fully foreseen but why wasnt 
it 
meanwhile that old argument about a shrinking pool of money 
commonplace a decade ago hasnt been raised in years 
why did it take wall street so long to spot the profits decline 
the rate of gain for corporate profits has been shrinking for a 
year based on at least one measurement profits rose about 35 
percent in 1988 about 20 percent in the 1989 first quarter and 
under 10 percent in the second quarter 
thats plenty of time to get adjusted to the direction of 
profits which worsened in the final quarter of the year 
repeatedly however wall street analysts have referred to the 
sudden profits decline odd 
what ever happened to service in this the service society 
what ever happened to communications in this the age of 
communications 
between parent and child teacher and student internal 
revenue service and taxpayer accountant and business owner 
patient and medical billing department technologist and user of 
technology 
this latter list is absolutely endless and the explanation for 
it will still leave you asking questions or possibly sorry you

western nations alarmed at a buildup of 
longrange missiles in the middle east imposed restrictions on the 
sale of sensitive equipment to third world countries but iraq is 
exploiting loopholes in those controls to develop a formidable 
missile arsenal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
despite efforts of industrialized nations 
to curtail a missile buildup in the middle east iraq is building 
an advanced arms industry with help from a network of hightech 
companies in the west 
iraq announced in december that it had launched a 48ton 
threestage rocket capable of putting a satellite in space and 
testfired two surfacetosurface missiles with a range of 1240 
miles 
us officials confirmed the dec 5 launch but did not say what 
type of missile was used 
industrialized nations alarmed at the arms buildup in the 
middle east have curbed the sale of sensitive equipment such as 
stateoftheart computers guidance systems heatresistant 
materials and computercontrolled machinery to third world 
countries 
but iraq has exploited loopholes in the controls imposed by the 
united states britain west germany france italy canada and 
japan in the missile technology control regime of 1987 
iraq iran syria saudi arabia and libya are all missile powers 
now all except libya have weapons capable of hitting cities in 
israel 
with superpower detente diminishing the threat of a ussoviet 
conflict analysts fear the most dangerous threat is now posed by 
the spread of longrange missiles in the third world 
one of the key weapons in president saddam husseins effort to 
make iraq the major regional power is a twostage ballistic 
missile the condor 2 capable of delivering nuclear or chemical 
warheads 
iraq has been developing the condor 2 with argentina and egypt 
since 1984 
iraqs arms industry is quite advanced now and saddam is 
certainly determined to build his missiles said hansheino 
kopietz a middle east analyst with londons international 
institute for strategic studies 
from what weve been able to determine the iraqis are capable 
of producing condor 2 but they still lack a reliable guidance 
system kopietz said in a telephone interview theyve been 
trying to get one from the germans 
some analysts believe iraq may be able to testfire a condor 2 
prototype in the next year or two 
israel claims iraq already has an accurate guidance system even 
so one israeli source said condor 2 was a long way from being 
deployed 
the iraqis are negotiating with brazils space agency for 
satellite technology under a 50 million deal analysts say 
ozilio silva director of the brazilian agency and a former 
president of brazils embraer aircraft manufacturer visited 
baghdad earlier this year and a team of iraqi scientists was in rio 
de janeiro last may 
france iraqs second biggest arms supplier after the soviet 
union sent an aerospace industry team to baghdad in november to 
discuss cooperation 
iraqs drive to build up its own defense industry like irans 
was spurred by the 8year persian gulf war it was the first 
conflict in which the belligerents hammered each others cities 
with missiles 
until recently many military analysts scoffed at iraqs claims 
it could produce advanced weapons systems 
but the iraqis unveiled a wide range of technology at the 
baghdad arms fair in april it included the lion of babylon tank a 
locally assembled soviet t72 that included systems developed by 
iraqi engineers and several missiles apparently modeled on soviet 
systems 
iraqi officials defend efforts to develop an arms industry by 
citing the threat from iran despite last years ceasefire in the 
war 
londons financial times quoted salah almoukhtar 
directorgeneral of iraqs information ministry as saying the 
only solution to the threat to our very existence is to establish 
our own military industry and provide our armed forces with iraqi 
arms 
like other iraqi officials he declined to discuss iraqs 
purchasing network beyond saying baghdad will get the technology 
it needs anywhere it can 
the iraqi network came to light in august when the us federal 
reserve found that the atlanta branch of italys banca nazionale de 
lavoro had extended unauthorized credit of nearly 3 billion to 
iraq since february 1988

<TEXT>
baghdad received as much as 17 billion worth of credit from 
the bank before the arrangement was discovered 
the iraqis are now demanding that the bank produce the other 
900 million promised by the atlanta branch 
much of the money the iraqis did get is believed to have been 
spent on purchasing components and technology for the condor and 
other military projects 
much of the equipment is believed to have ended up at the 
topsecurity saad 16 research complex south of baghdad where work 
on condor 2 has been carried out the complex is also believed to 
be used for chemical weapons development 
other research and development facilities are at alanbar west 
of baghdad where the satellite rocket was reported launched on 
dec 5 and at mosul in the mountainous north a major military 
industries complex is located at taji north of baghdad 
western officials say much of the equipment was purchased 
through a europeanbased consortium of 16 companies known as 
consen based in zug switzerland and monte carlo the group 
procured missile technology and components for iraqs technical 
corps for special projects known as techcorp 
techcorp was established two years ago within the ministry of 
industry and military industrialization headed by gen hussein 
kamel saddams soninlaw he has overall charge of developing 
iraqs arms industry 
corporate records show the iraqis also bought into european 
companies one is britains matrixchurchill which sold the iraqis 
computercontrolled machinery worth 40 million in deals financed 
by credit extended by banca nazionale de lavoro 
another iraqi conduit is the londonbased technology and 
development group which financed a buyout of matrixchurchill in 
1987 by alarabi trading co of baghdad and made an unsuccessful 
bid to buy an aerospace company in northern ireland earlier this 
year 
a british directory of iraqi commerce shows that all of 
alarabis directors are iraqi and include several who hold senior 
posts in state companies in iraq 
two safa habobi and hanan jon are listed as senior officials 
in the stateowned tajibased nasr enterprise for mechanical 
industries one of matrixchurchills main customers 
a british foreign office spokesman who declined to be 
identified said in a telephone interview were aware that some 
british companies have connections with iraq a country about which 
we are concerned 
the financial times said other companies linked to the hightech 
flow to iraq include tektronix of oregon and hewlettpackard of 
california as well as italys sniabpd a fiat subsidiary 
swedens bofors frances sagem and west germanys 
messerschmittbolkowblohm aerospace giant 
hewlettpackard exported computers and other electronic 
equipment to west german companies which transferred them to iraq 
in 198586 the financial times said 
western intelligence agencies believe that messerschmitt was to 
supply guidance systems sniabpd the rocket motors and fuel and 
sagem the inertial navigation systems messerschmitt and snia deny 
involvement in condor 
however west german authorities began investigating a 
messerschmitt subsidiary mbbtranstechnica and other german 
companies several months ago amid suspicions they had violated 
export regulations by shipping missile components to iraq through 
consen 
british broadcasting corp reported in april that messerschmitt 
was supplying parts for a missile research laboratory in iraq 
bbc televisions panorama also quoted a messerschmitt 
metalworkers union chief klaus mehrens as saying the company was 
violating the spirit of german restrictions on arms exports even 
if they got legal licenses 
messerschmitt executives were quoted as saying the company had 
conducted a feasibility study on the condor project but did not 
pursue it because of suspicions over how argentina planned to use 
the missile 
bofors has been investigated by swedish authorities for 
illegally selling weapons to iran saudi arabia india and other 
countries 
western military sources and diplomats in baghdad said iraq has 
used french yugoslav italian west german and italian technicians 
on the condor project 
in july italian police arrested eight former snia technicians 
who were indicted on charges of shipping militaryrelated equipment 
to iraq last november italy tightened controls on arms exports to 
nonnato countries

israel is attempting to sabotage iraqs 
development of the condor 2 ballistic weapon which threatens the 
jewish states superiority in the mideast arms race according to 
some military analysts in the west 
israeli leaders have made clear that iraqs missile program 
combined with its arsenal of chemical weapons and its reported 
effort to develop nuclear weapons poses a serious threat 
its clearly in the israelis interest to try to sabotage the 
condor project and at least put it back a few years while they 
develop their own new missile systems to hold their technological 
edge a western military source in london said in a telephone 
interview 
iraq has warned the israelis not to attempt a preemptive strike 
to knock out the condor project 
in 1981 the israelis fearing that iraq was developing a 
military nuclear weapon at a frenchbuilt reactor near baghdad 
knocked it out in a spectacular longrange fighterbomber raid 
some analysts suspect the israelis have already taken military 
action against the condor project 
diplomats in baghdad have confirmed reports of a huge explosion 
in august at an iraqi military complex at aliskandariyah killing 
hundreds of workers 
iraq claimed 19 people were killed in a fuel depot explosion in 
south baghdad about that time 
farzad bazoft an iranianborn british journalist investigating 
the aliskandariyah blast was arrested in september on charges of 
spying for israel 
its generally considered that the israelis were behind the 
explosion the military source in london said 
the iraqis claim israels mossad secret service has assassinated 
several key experts associated with condor 
israeli alarm heightened last year when saudi arabia disclosed 
it had obtained chinesebuilt css2 ballistic missiles with a range 
of 1600 miles 
western intelligence sources said there are at least 10 css2s 
in silos built in the assulayyil region southwest of riyadh the 
capital other reports say the saudis have 28 css2s 
israel is developing its own ballistic missile the jericho ii 
with a range of 800 miles and capable of carrying a nuclear warhead 
us officials said in october that israel is cooperating with 
south africa on the jericho ii and last year testfired one of the 
mediumrange weapons at the armaston testing range on the indian 
ocean near cape town 
the israelis are also reported to be working on an antimissile 
missile the arrow with technology adapted from the us star 
wars program iraq claims it is also working on an antimissile 
missile 
so far no state in the region has the ability to shoot down 
missiles 
the israelis last year launched a satellite ofek1 for what 
was officially described as scientific studies but military 
experts believe the israelis want to develop a military spy 
satellite that could be linked to the antimissile program

dogs have long been used for tracking fugitives 
or sniffing out marijuana and other drugs now arson investigators 
have found they have an uncanny ability for finding traces of 
gasoline or some other inflammable material at the scene of a 
suspicious fire 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
only one out of 100 dogs makes the grade in this 
elite k9 corps pedigrees count for naught most of them have been 
rescued from the pound 
these dogs easily work for up to six hours in frigid 
temperatures sniffing charred debris even through ice and water 
park avenue dogs with their little coldweather outfits for 
15minute walks need not apply 
the top requirement for these dogs is to have the will and 
stamina to play all day long because for them it is a game 
for arson investigators it is serious business 
the investigators credit these dogs with helping bring in 
firstdegree murder indictments saving hundreds of manhours and 
thousands of tax dollars and they say their true potential is 
still unknown 
they are officially called accelerant detection dogs and the 
program is one of the newest ways to use mans best friend 
trainers estimate there are only about two dozen trained dogs in 
about a dozen states thus far 
the dogs are trained to take the investigator to the spot where 
an arsonist poured gasoline alcohol fingernail polish remover or 
some other inflammable liquid 
the dogs must find all of the spots where the accelerants were 
poured which is why trainers stress the importance of the dogs 
innate play drive after he is rewarded for the first find hes 
called upon to keep looking until he exhausts all possible sites 
one of the reasons investigators collect multiple samples is 
that the dogs are better than the sophisticated equipment back at 
the laboratory the dogs they think can sniff out parts per 
trillion the best science can do is parts per million handlers 
are often sure their dogs are correct but the equipment cannot 
corroborate it 
the dogs can also differentiate between accelerants and similar 
chemical gases normally found at a fire scene when items such as 
plastic have burned the field equipment often gives false positive 
readings the dogs dont 
he doesnt make mistakes says michael e knowlton a new 
york state arson investigator who has a 90pound yellow labrador 
retriever named buddy new york state has two dogs available to 
every city and county 
in maryland the second state in the country to have an 
arsonsniffing dog barney was instrumental in the firstdegree 
murder indictments of an arsonist in the deaths of three children 
barney a 123pound black labrador picked the suspect out of a 
lineup four men plus the suspect were standing in a room when john 
farrell barneys handler opened the door and sent the big dog in 
barney roamed around then sat down directly in front of the 
suspect all of the dogs sit when they make a positive 
identification some like barney will go a step further 
show me commanded farrell barney put his nose on the mans 
shoes 
the fbi lab confirmed the dogs findings kerosene on the shoes 
barney had earlier identified the spots where kerosene had been 
poured at the fire site 
the man goes to trial in late march 
barney and john farrell chief of operations in the arson k9 
unit in baltimore have traveled up and down the east coast helping 
states without arsonsniffing dogs of their own 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms in connecticut 
along with the connecticut state police trained the first arson 
sniffing dog 
farrell who had trained hunting dogs for more than 40 years 
heard about the program and went up to connecticut to investigate 
he could not get government funds when he got back to maryland 
in frustration i trained my own dog to see if i could do what 
i saw i wanted to prove that it worked says farrell who has 
almost 25 years of service in the maryland state fire marshals 
office 
thanks to the success of barney the nations second arson dog 
maryland now has six arson dogs 
new jersey police sgt dennis mcsweeny a k9 instructor for 
many years has trained many of the dogs for other states the two 
dogs working for new york state buddy and hershey were trained by 
mcsweeny in a 10week course in atlantic city nj 
mcsweeny and farrell know of arson dogs in north and south 
carolina maine florida washington iowa and kansas as well as 
new york new jersey connecticut and maryland

<TEXT>
although labradors have predominated any breed will do but the 
individual dog has to be special 
only five out of 500 dogs will make it through the course 
says mcsweeny they must have a very sociable temperament and an 
extremely strong play drive the ones that wash out usually get 
bored and wont keep going the dog has to want to play this game 
over and over 
like all good animal acts this one is based on the dogs 
natural instinct to fetch and retrieve one of the reasons that 
labs and other hunting dogs have predominated the dog is imprinted 
with the scent of various accelerants from the four basic groups 
and when he is brought to the fire scene he essentially is 
retrieving that scent 
the dogs first receive basic obedience training as well as 
physical conditioning they climb stairs fire escapes hurdle over 
barriers learn to hop from one boat to another at sea ride in a 
helicopter and get hoisted up 75 feet in an aerial bucket all 
with aplomb or it doesnt count 
the dog must be ready to go right to work when he gets to the 
scene and we may have to helicopter him in or have him on a fire 
escape knowlton says he must be able to do these things 
without getting flustered 
the eventempered lab is perfect and his endurance and ability 
to withstand cold are also assets however there is an english 
springer spaniel named ty in iowa city a few german shepherds one 
mutt a golden retriever and a german shorthaired pointer among 
this emerging band of firefighters 
there are no bloodhounds 
bloodhounds are the dumbest animals in the world offers 
mcsweeny weve trained bloodhounds who couldnt find their food 
dish 
when knowlton took the course from mcsweeny he went through 
four other dogs that washed out before he was paired with buddy 
it took four weeks for buddy to learn and it took me six weeks 
to learn to read him knowlton says 
knowlton says that when he is working buddy in extremely cold 
weather he puts him back in the car to warm up after six hours of 
sniffing through the ice that forms as firefighters put out the 
blaze 
knowlton 38 who is divorced says his three daughters love 
buddy and always want to play find the cause 
buddy however is never allowed to chase rabbits squirrels 
cats or other dogs 
after a demonstration of buddys prowess at the new york state 
fire academy on randalls island buddy found a plank of wood under 
the light snow and brought it back for knowlton to toss buddy 
didnt tire of the game but when it was time to go knowlton 
sharply said no and buddy dropped the plank and readily reported 
for duty the duty being a sixhour drive to watertown ny to 
help investigate a major fire in which three people died in a 
senior citizens center 
knowlton says he has to watch out for buddy he wont let the 
dog get hurt at one fire scene red and blue chemicals were still 
oozing on the surface when knowlton and buddy arrived 
i didnt know what that stuff was says knowlton i 
wouldnt let buddy go in until after it dried 
the dog in iowa city is decked out with rubber boots which he 
hates when he is called upon to work in such a situation 
the dogs have shown time and time again they are better than the 
laboratories but so far there has been no court case in which it 
was the dogs word against the suspects 
mcsweeny doesnt think that will ever happen 
the attorneys will never allow one of these dogs in a 
courtroom he says they would demonstrate to a jury what they 
can do and that would be that whats the attorney going to say to 
discredit the dog 
knowlton has testified twice before a grand jury describing 
buddys work buddys feats are also videotaped should they be 
needed in a courtroom 
in tests trainers have taken pieces of wood set two on fire 
with accelerants and let the others burn naturally time after time 
the dogs picked out the pieces of charred wood that held traces of 
the accelerant at first the laboratories could confirm it 
eventually the trace got too light for science but not for the 
dogs they still knew which pieces of wood were set on fire by the 
accelerants leading investigators to believe they are scenting in 
the parts per trillion range 
the trainers say the dogs sense of smell is roughly 100 times 
better than mans with good reason humans have 5 million cells 
devoted to the sense of smell dogs have 220 million

the legend of the greek shipping tycoons began 
earlier this century with the sea wolves sea captains who 
acquired vast fleets dynamic magnates with business savvy and a 
gamblers touch their lives and loves were chronicled on the front 
pages of the world press now a new breed is at the helm 
introducing modern business practices and much of the adventure 
has been lost 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they were the golden greeks fiercely 
independent men who controlled the worlds shipping built lush 
island paradises and married societys most glamorous women 
aristotle onassis stavros niarchos and their contemporaries are 
still revered in piraeus base of the powerful greek shipping 
industry but today a new tycoon is succeeding them the young 
businessman who shuns publicity and knows computers as well as 
compasses 
twenty years ago a shipowner was treated like a god said 
diamantis diamantides who controls 25 ships now hes a simple 
person 
the greek shipping tradition is thousands of years old a 
product of the countrys entrepreneurial talent and its kinship 
with the sea which is within 50 miles of almost any part of greece 
the legend of the greek tycoon began earlier this century with 
the sea wolves sea captains who acquired fleets it reached 
its personification in niarchos and onassis volatile dynamic 
magnates with business savvy and a gamblers touch whose lives and 
loves were chronicled on the front pages of the world press 
many of the newer managers have maintained their predecessors 
passion for the sea and their strong preference for familyrun 
firms but they are increasingly making longerterm investments 
imposing modern business practices and buying newer hightech 
ships 
were tending toward structured companies in corporate form as 
opposed to personalitydriven onassistype companies said 
emmanuel a vordonis director of thenamaris ships management inc 
until recently greeks owned the worlds largest merchant fleet 
the japanese are now no 1 but greece is close behind with 82 
million tons of cargocarrying capacity according to the 
authoritative shipping magazine naftiliaki 
some of the change of style in greek shipowning is due to the 
crisis that hit the industry from 1975 to 1987 stemming from 
overbuilding of ships and competitive freightrate cutting at a 
time of stagnating world trade this bustling port near athens is 
still haunted by memories of proud shipowners losing their vessels 
to creditors 
diamantides 42 who began buying ships in 1975 after working in 
shipping offices says oldtime magnates could get bank loans on 
the strength of their names 
now you have to convince them with your figures he said 
business practices also have changed with the infusion of a 
different kind of shipowner either entrepreneurs from industry or 
construction attracted by a potential fortune or the children of 
traditional shipowners who have received advanced degrees in 
business or engineering at british or american universities 
the new generation of managers has a different investment 
approach said dimitri krondiras the local director of citibank 
the major lender for greek ship purchases this new generation 
perceives that investment in shipping is highrisk 
because of that gamble some shipowners have diversified into 
oil banking or hotel chains others are trying to cater more to 
the changing market purchasing newer more customized ships 
a few shipowners are even beginning to raise money by opening 
their companies to outside investment and floating shares on the 
stock market previously a kind of heresy in greek shipowning 
says george anastassopoulos the former head of the transport 
commission in the european parliament 
one example of the new greek tycoon is thanasis martinos whose 
family founded thenamaris hailed as the mozart of shipping for 
his precociousness martinos entered the business as a teenager 
when his mother and her brothers a shipping lawyer and a sea 
captain bought their first ship 
martinos worked with the firm while studying economics in 
london now 40 he and his two brothers head thenamaris which runs 
55 ships itself and manages about 20 for other people 
vordonis the director of the firm says the older generation 
had the risk approach the hardwork approach the 
entrepreneurial approach to bringing resources together that were 
difficult to bring together 
now he says shipowners rely on highspeed information relayed 
by computers tight cost control and a team approach 
where oldstyle magnates used to make most decisions sometimes 
screaming down cowering subordinates the modern entrepreneurs are 
trying to attract and rely on technical experts to keep up with a 
fastmoving efficient more hightech field 
in order to achieve you need technology modern management 
techniques vordonis says you go into how to manage people 
a glance at the thenamaris offices illustrates the change 
unlike the traditional roughandtumble offices tucked along the 
piraeus waterfront thenamaris is a gleaming glassandconcrete 
ring in a lush coastal suburb sunlight pours into an airy core 
water trickles through leafy plants in a central atrium 
we have round tables where everyone feels equal we tried to 
make it as friendly as possible vordonis says in addition to 
achieving efficiency you must have people working in a high tone 
in addition to keeping a lower profile at the office the new 
tycoons avoid publicity in their private lives gone are the days 
when niarchos and onassis competed in the public eye building 
everbigger yachts and purchasing islands they turned into 
paradises with imported trees and exotic birds 
onassis dominated gossip columns through his affair with opera 
singer maria callas and later marriage to jacqueline kennedy while 
niarchos married among others charlotte ford daughter of 
carmaker henry ford 
todays shipowners keep elegant villas with swimming pools in 
athens northern suburbs and vacation getaways on the greek 
islands as well as homes in london switzerland or monte carlo 
but they are content to stay out of the spotlight some say a 
high profile would hurt their efforts to emphasize a team approach 
in their businesses 
whether the new tycoons will achieve the success of their 
predecessors is still an open question 
many firms are still run by the older generation with their 
sons or daughters waiting in the wings to test newer business 
strategies 
and while the younger managers may have more sophisticated 
economic approaches shipowning is still highly risky and dependent 
on many outside factors such as wars and the price of oil 
anastassopoulos says the new shipping executives go to the best 
schools and are better prepared than their predecessors but he 
adds whether they will be as intelligent and adventurous as 
their fathers remains to be seen

its an obscure magazine offering reviews of 
thousands of other obscure magazines factsheet five is the 
handiwork of michael gunderloy who set aside his chemical 
engineering degree to devote full time to publishing his directory 
of offbeat publications 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thousands of magazines are piled 
throughout michael gunderloys home but dont ask him to pull out 
a copy of time or newsweek or readers digest theyre too 
conventional 
however hell gladly produce american window cleaner a trade 
journal for those who squeegee for a living 
or gunderloy can find his copy of civilian defense news amp 
opinion a newsletter put out by those who believe in creating a 
national defense by training americans in nonviolent 
noncooperation with any invader 
theres always chokehold a wrestling magazine daily cow is a 
humor magazine written from the animals point of view and 
frostbite falls farflung flier features the cartoon characters 
rocky and bullwinkle 
it has happened that the rensselaer post office has sent me 
stuff just because it looks flaky and they dont know who else to 
send it to says gunderloy a 30yearold with black hair tied in 
a ponytail 
gunderloy collects the magazines for his own journal factsheet 
five the bible of the underground or alternative press five 
times a year factsheet five contains reviews of as many of this 
countrys estimated 6000 selfpublished magazines as gunderloy can 
get his hands on 
anyone with access to a copier can theoretically become a 
publisher and many people do once thought the province of 1960s 
radicals plotting campus takeovers the alternative press is 
flourishing in the 1980s gunderloy says 
he calls them zines thats short for fanzines but although 
many publications show slavish devotion to certain rock bands 
others cover far different territories in politics and the arts 
gunderloy has set aside his chemical engineering degree to give 
his full energies to his marginally profitable newsletter his 
wife a physics professor helps pay the bills 
he chronicles publications with names like filth the lame 
monkey manifesto nuclear mutinous dogs and the occasional journal 
of nothing in particular with obsessive detail in print so small 
its almost painful to read 
zines range in size from slick music publications like maximum 
rock n roll and flip side with 15000 circulations to the 
colleen scene a newsletter put out by a california woman with a 
circulation of one 
she types it on demand everyone gets an original copy 
gunderloy says its mostly rambling about what she did that day 
and what she heard on the radio 
some zine culture eventually goes mainstream backstreets is a 
widely quoted magazine devoted to bruce springsteen and its 
publisher has written a book on the boss science fiction zines are 
a fertile ground for talent producing such mainstream talent as 
writer robert silverberg 
music zines routinely trumpet bands such as the heavy metal 
favorites metallica long before they become popular 
there is a lot of talent out there in some cases waiting to 
be discovered and in some cases being discovered gunderloy says 
other zine culture will probably remain underground 
the magazine ripping headaches with interviews with obscure 
heavy metal rockers fatal blessing devastation and vomit is not 
likely to make too many newsstands 
cartoonists use the zines as a proving ground many gunderloy 
says are mainly interested in proving how shocking they can be 
gunderloy suspects the controversy over robert mapplethorpes 
governmentsponsored homosexual art caused many publications to 
push the boundaries of obscenity as far as possible 
mapplethorpes work he says would be far too tame for a lot 
of people to put into their magazines this sort of shock therapy 
has gotten to the point of absurdity 
in a strange way gunderloy says the magazines he gets tell him 
a lot about whats going on in the country 
dozens of new publications provide evidence of an upsurge in 
environmentalism he says the countrys conservative drift through 
the 80s was obvious in several alternative college newspapers 
i get the latest news from people that might not have made it 
into the new york times which i dont have time to read he 
says 
gunderloys own press run is nearly 7000 per issue hell list 
the magazine of anyone who sends him a copy and is available by 
phone 
while many zines try to entertain others try to inform albeit 
in very specialized fields the mandocrucians digest is about 
people who play the mandolin suds n stuff is the newsletter of 
beer drinkers international while jewish vegetarians of north 
america is selfexplanatory 
gunderloy says hes impressed with the quality of much of what 
he gets although ive also gotten things from people who are 
probably certifiably nuts 
he says he once gave a bad review to a newsletter put out by a 
man who claimed to be psychically responsible for the auto accident 
that killed singer harry chapin 
he wrote back a letter suggesting i could be made to slip in 
the shower and break an ankle he says 
factsheet five also publishes poetry reviews and keeps track of 
cassette culture people who record and distribute their own 
music 
gunderloy wants eventually to publish factsheet five which 
began as a twopage mimeographed sheet and now stretches beyond 100 
pages every two months he does it largely himself sitting behind 
a personal computer and sifting through his mail 
these people are out there because theyre really interested 
in it they dont care about making a buck he says thats 
what excites me its seeing something thats well done

she is a thanatologist in plain talk a death 
counselor she works in prison dealing with people who have been 
sentenced to die by nature not the courts aids is a tortured way 
to die and hers is a tortured job guiding the doomed through 
their last days behind prison walls 
</TEXT>

aids may be the loneliest disease in the 
world and donalyn gross says there is probably no lonelier place 
than prison to die of it away from family and friends and shunned 
by other inmates 
since gross began work at somers state prison two years ago as a 
thanatologist counseling inmates with aids she has watched 18 of 
her patients succumb to the disease 
dying of aids on the outside is one thing but dying in 
prison its tough its really tough gross says 
gross who believes she is the only death counselor in a us 
correctional facility spends her days in the prisons chronic 
ward otherwise known as the aids ward with rapists murderers and 
drug dealers she laughs cries and shares secrets with them 
trying to make death a little less frightening 
state prison officials estimate about 15 percent of the states 
inmates carry the aids virus according to correction department 
spokesman bill flower 
gross a resident of springfield mass got her first exposure 
working with the dying when she volunteered at a nursing home at 
age 15 
i remember a lot of people dying alone with no families she 
says recalling one woman who would sit alone in her wheelchair day 
after day with no visitors 
when the woman died gross went to her funeral and was stunned 
to find a church full of mourners the woman did in fact have 
family and friends they just werent with her at the end 
gross has discovered its even more true of inmates at somers 
connecticuts only maximumsecurity prison many of them were 
abandoned by their families before they became sick but when the 
symptoms of aids become pronounced even fewer people want to visit 
them 
while the fear of contracting aids has made others shy away from 
aids patients gross says it was acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome that drew her to somers in the first place 
id worked with cancer patients for 12 years and when aids 
came along i knew i wanted to get involved she says i looked 
all over the place and then someone suggested the prisons 
massachusetts prison officials werent responsive to the idea 
but connecticut officials were willing to give her a try at somers 
just over the state line where she lives 
she started as a volunteer at somers then was given a contract 
she now spends five days a week at the prison and is on call at all 
times 
as devastating as cancer is gross says aids is worse cancer 
seems so much gentler than aids 
gross says an inmate enters the chronic ward on the brink of 
death when he gets really bad hes taken to saint francis 
hospital and medical center in hartford after intense treatment he 
returns thinner and weaker but still alive waiting for the next 
onslaught 
the hard thing with something like aids is that it can go on 
for so long gross says 
some inmates are so afraid of the aids stigma that they deny 
theyre sick even at the risk of not getting the new medical 
treatments known to help aids patients 
on her way to and through the ward guards and inmates alike 
smile and wave 
upstairs five inmates were living in the ninebed ward three 
were watching a sitcom on television two lay in bed on the other 
end of the room uninterested 
one not unlike others gross has worked with collects news 
articles on aids and devours all the literature he can find on the 
disease gross helps bringing in articles and videotapes 
recently she brought in a tape about the giant aids quilt for 
which people from all over the country have sewn panels in memory 
of someone they loved and lost to the disease the video depressed 
some of the inmates but they discussed it and felt better in the 
end 
gross tries to help the inmates come to terms with impending 
death without overwhelming them with gloom well discuss 
funerals but i wont push it 
prison policy prevents inmates from being interviewed but a 
note gross received from an inmate after he had been rushed to 
saint francis hospital provided a glimpse into what her friendship 
means to them 
stay here with me he wrote im scared and lonely 
the petite 39yearold redhead says she is not frightened by 
working with criminals 
people always say arent you afraid she says some of 
the guys i dont even know what theyre in here for im not here 
to judge im here to give them some compassion 
nor is she worried about getting aids herself 
i sit on the bed and i give them back rubs gross says i 
never wear a mask i dont like to do that its like having the 
plague 
if i have a cut on my hand and im going to give someone a 
back rub ill put a bandaid on it if im going to get it im 
going to get it 
gross credits somers for being progressive enough to allow her 
to work with its dying inmates and somers credits gross for taking 
on the task 
it is an extremely good program and one that is beneficial to 
the clients that she serves in ways that i cant even begin to 
imagine says the correction departments flower its a 
humanitarian program a compassionate program and worthwhile 
although new inmates at somers get a lecture about aids and how 
it is spread gross says many are too macho to listen she thinks 
the number of dying inmates will only increase particularly as 
prisons become more overcrowded 
gross thinks more death counselors could make the situation 
easier with that in mind she has written prison officials across 
the country to urge them to come up with money for such positions 
in the meantime shell continue offering solace to the dying 
when somebodys dying i spend as much time with them as i 
can she says when someone dies i feel sad because i got 
close to that person but i feel good because i know i did what i 
could and then ive got to get up and go on to the next person 
i love my guys

hes a lifelong mormon who writes about the 
people he knows best fellow members of the church of jesus christ 
of latterday saints neal chandler concedes he has a limited 
audience mormon attitudes toward fiction being what they are and 
nonmormons cant relate to what hes writing about but profit is 
not his motive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
neal chandler knows he wont get rich or 
famous writing stories about mormons for one thing he says most 
mormons dont read fiction 
but chandler gets his reward in the winces or belly laughs of 
recognition he elicits from the few who do 
ive been told by many people that im wasting time and talent 
on mormon culture says chandler coordinator of the creative 
writing program at cleveland state university in ohio 
chandler a lifelong mormon doesnt agree 
its my resource and its a rich one he says and to 
turn away from it for marketing reasons seems just strange to me i 
cannot even conceive of doing it i know a great deal about 
mormonism and i care a great deal about these things these 
people 
chandlers first book a collection of 15 stories titled 
benediction was published recently by the university of utah 
press as part of its mormon studies series 
some of the story titles betray chandlers aim to illuminate 
often with humor what he describes as that middle place between 
us and the larger american culture they include the 
righteousness hall of fame mormon tabernacle blues and the 
only divinely authorized plan for financial success in this life or 
the next 
in the latter a mormon woman justifies involvement in a pyramid 
scheme by pointing out the pyramid on the back of a dollar bill as 
signifying christian capitalism mandated by the founding 
fathers 
after chandlers story benediction was published in a mormon 
journal in 1985 he received a call late at night from a man he 
barely knew who said hed just read the story his wife was now 
reading it the man said and she was laughing so hard she wet 
her pants 
it doesnt strike nonmormons the same way because they have 
no way of relating to it chandler says 
chandler realizes his audience will be narrow because only a 
small percentage of the worlds 67 million mormons are 
intellectuals and only a fraction of those read fiction 
mormons even intellectual mormons are so concerned about 
being taken seriously that they take themselves terribly 
seriously chandler says and fiction seems to most of them to 
violate that tendency even among people who read and are educated 
it doesnt seem somehow to be respectable 
for example chandler says people come up to him and say 
hey i read your article that used to strike him as odd no 
more 
ive just come to the conclusion that story while im sure 
it is a word that is included in their vocabulary is not somehow 
emotionally includable he says the term that seems 
respectable is article 
chandler 47 does not have to rely on flights of fancy for his 
glimpses of mormon life in the late 20th century he was born and 
raised a mormon in salt lake city he served a 2year church 
mission in northern germany and has lived mostly outside utah since 
i think the truth is that when the stories seem the most 
outrageous they are most likely to be grounded in real 
experience says chandler the sunday school superintendent in 
his shaker heights ohio congregation 
he believes that since the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints shed its polygamist roots and began after world war ii to 
gain respectability its members have become increasingly confused 
about who they are as they embrace nonmormon ideals in business 
and other fields 
mormons he says like to think of themselves as the 
quintessential americans but i think in the long term we cant be 
that and preserve ourselves as the religiously motivated energized 
and guided culture that we need to be 
chandler is careful to draw a distinction between utah mormons 
with pioneer ancestry and mormons elsewhere the former he says 
sort of sense themselves as a kind of mormon nobility and 
aristocracy when they go out to the rest of the church they go out 
as ambassadors in a sense 
and so there is in the mission field a sense of inferiority 
against that kind of background 
chandler plans other writing projects not all of them 
mormonrelated including a political novel and another book of 
stories but his most ambitious work will be a novel set in central 
utah for which he will draw on historical mythical and folklore

i started looking into television i was interested in the 
halfhour comedy format then grand came along and i was 
intrigued by the character i liked the idea that she was funny but 
also serious i like it that she has contact with everyone in the 
cast and is not confined to just one area

if its love letters it must be lynn 
redgrave or was it colleen dewhurst elaine stritch swoosie kurtz 
or stockard channing and was she joined by richard thomas jason 
robards christopher reeve or cliff robertson 
a different cast starred each week in the ar gurney play on 
and offbroadway an idea its producers hope to continue as the 
twocharacter comedydrama multiplies in other productions across 
the country and perhaps heads for london later this year 
more than 60 performers appeared in the play during its new york 
run that began last valentines day at a special benefit 
performance starring kathleen turner and john rubinstein and ends 
today after a 3month engagement at broadways edison theater in 
between there were twiceweekly performances at the promenade 
theater offbroadway that later became eight shows a week before 
the move to the edison 
but its not the end for the play which looks at a man and 
woman two upperclass wasps through their letters to each other 
from the ages of 7 until they are about 60 
a company is now playing in san francisco where the actors 
rotate every two weeks among the performers playing there have 
been polly bergen robert vaughn alexis smith and fritz weaver 
another troupe opens in boston on feb 20 for seven weeks with 
seven different casts 
also in february love letters will be performed sundays 
and mondays at the pasadena playhouse in california with a regular 
run scheduled to start in a los angeles theater in midmarch 
a chicago company is also under discussion as is a national 
tour in the fall richard frankel who produced the play with roger 
l stevens thomas viertel and steven baruch describes that as 
unique 
were going to be booking the show into normal broadway road 
houses he says for example we might do two weeks at the 
kennedy center or two weeks in philadelphia or a week in lexington 
ky but they wont necessarily be continuous and they might be 
overlapping and they almost certainly will be with different 
actors 
it would be an unconventional tour for an unconventional play 
that playwright gurney insists must be read not acted by its 
stars 
these are two lovers who communicate through their letters 
gurney says they are both liberated and trapped in their own 
mail when they get together physically with one exception its 
normally bad the letters are the windows through which they wave 
at each other 
the play can be performed almost anywhere it requires no 
scenery and only a few props a table two chairs two small 
lecterns a water pitcher and two glasses the actors even wear 
their own clothes 
love letters was first done at the new york public library 
in march 1988 with holland taylor and gurney himself reading the 
play 
i was supposed to make a speech at the library but told them i 
wanted to do the play instead he recalls since it runs longer 
than a speech i broke it into two parts and told everybody they 
could leave if they wanted to nobody seemed to want to so i knew 
the play interested people 
if the show has a minimum of props it has required a maximum of 
effort behind the scenes to cast each week 
the hardest part of the new york production was that it was 
like an opening every week says frankel linda wright works for 
frankel as an assistant but she took over casting chores for the 
new york run as well as the outoftown assignments 
the most difficult thing is getting the right people 
together she says you cant do it with a much older man and a 
much younger woman these people supposedly went to school 
together 
originally most of the new york casts were in their early 40s 
and stretched into their 50s but it has been done successfully by 
younger actors such as timothy hutton and elizabeth mcgovern 
the actors all got the same amount of rehearsal time one 
threehour afternoon session in frankels office with director john 
tillinger going over the play tillinger read through the play with 
the newcomers each week 
the two stars dont have approval of their other halves 
frankel says sometimes we start with a pair we approach them 
both at the same time sometimes well talk to one person and they 
will suggest partners its a friendly negotiation process 
john rubinstein had never met stockard channing before they did 
love letters he had done the show before with joanna gleason 
channing had performed it with bruce davison they both had other 
commitments and arrived at the theater 40 minutes before the 
curtain went up 
they barely had time to say hello before going to work 
frankel says 
a few husbands and wives also have done the play among them 
nancy marchand and paul sparer as well as lynn redgrave and john 
clark 
word is now out among the acting community about what an 
excellent showcase love letters can be for a performer 
actors like to do it because its a good way for producers and 
agents to get a look at what they can do frankel says 
the commitment for only a week appeals to many performers who 
have family or longrange show business commitments 
some of the actors have appeared in different cities and may 
work again on the various tours robert vaughn and polly bergen did 
it in san francisco and then did it in new york lynn redgrave and 
john clark having performed the play in new york also will work 
in san francisco 
the thought of doing material this good and not having to 
learn it was fabulous redgrave says plus the play was 
something that my husband and i could do together after all these 
years we havent acted together since we met 23 years ago 
frankel insists the play stays remarkably the same even with its 
different performers 
because it is a new cast every week who are directed by the 
same director i think it has strayed less than a normal show does 
during a long run he says there is someone going back to the 
book every week instructing the actors how it is to be done 
having said that the show is totally different with different 
people doing it liz mcgovern and timothy hutton will be different 
from jason robards and colleen dewhurst everybody brings their own 
experience to it 
by the time love letters finishes its journey around the 
country there will be a lot of alumni the new york alumni already 
have a souvenir each received a very preppy crew neck sweater for 
their weeks work

richard chamberlains hawaiibased medical 
series is undergoing cosmetic surgery to make it more attractive to 
the audience 
in the near future his character of dr daniel kulani in 
island son will spend more time away from the hospital and 
become more involved with people the cbs show also has new opening 
credits and new music that went into effect when island son 
moved from tuesday to thursday in middecember 
when we go back into production after the first of the year 
well open up the show and spend more time out of the hospital 
says chamberlain youll see those changes around february 
chamberlain says this will take island son closer to its 
original concept of a man who was educated in modern medicine yet 
still honors the hawaii traditions and folk medicine of his 
upbringing 
these are things weve been asking for for a long time he 
says the drop in the ratings seems to support me now everyone 
has the same idea the interesting thing to me as an actor is the 
human side not the medical drama i think people have seen enough 
faulty gall bladders and hematomas 
even doctors have a life outside the hospital which may come 
as a surprise to some people ill be involved in closer 
relationships with the residents and some surprising things will 
happen in my life my exwife is going to come back and cause me 
some severe emotional difficulties 
besides family and human relations the show will have fast cars 
and martial arts 
chamberlain is no stranger to hospitals of course his first 
and only other series dr kildare was one of televisions 
earliest and most successful medical dramas 
since that series in 196166 chamberlain made a name for 
himself as a classical actor in england starred on broadway made 
a number of feature films and became the king of television 
miniseries 
he was interviewed during a visit to the mainland while island 
son was temporarily out of production even before starting the 
series he had moved to hawaii 
ive always wanted a house by the sea everything i looked at 
in malibu was impossible you cant get into malibu for less than 
3 million i found this place in hawaii its beautiful and off 
the beaten track after doing a miniseries it was a place for me to 
go and recuperate its very healing and soothing 
the actor says hes been traveling consistently for 25 years and 
wouldnt have missed a second of it but he adds 
i wanted to put down some roots i wanted to stop living out 
of a suitcase besides staying put another reason i wanted to do a 
series was that i wanted to be involved on the production side im 
coexecutive producer of island son that makes the job even more 
interesting for me 
the miniseries chamberlain has done have taken him all over the 
world centennial landed him in colorado shogun in japan 
wallenberg a heros story and the bourne identity in 
europe and dream west in the american west the thorn 
birds an australian story was the only one chamberlain made in 
california 
two films king solomons mines and allan quartermain and 
the lost city of gold took him to africa for many months 
recently he went back to spain where he had done the three 
musketeers and the four musketeers for return of the 
musketeers he plays aramis 
chamberlains hawaiibased show had been in development for a 
long time there were extensive delays in finding a suitable 
writer nigel and carol evan mckeand who had done family were 
signed as executive producers only five weeks before production 
began chamberlain would like it much better if the writing and 
production staff would move to hawaii but he knows that will never 
happen 
its difficult to grasp the feeling of the islands if youve 
never lived there he says our original idea was somewhat 
different from whats been seen so far we were going to have more 
of hawaii itself in it and more of its healing arts kulani is a 
man who was adopted by a traditional hawaiian family and raised in 
this culture 
i think the first script stressed that too much and lorimar 
television and cbs got anxious so were bringing that back we 
didnt intend to be so confined to the hospital were opening that 
up

years of national economic decline 
have plunged brazils educational system into a crisis that 
officials fear will deprive the country of the brainpower needed to 
ensure social stability in the future 
illiteracy is creeping back up the student dropout rate is 
rising and schools are forced to close for lack of money schools 
that survive are turning out illinformed unskilled graduates the 
officials say 
a small elite of college graduates frustrated by shrinking job 
markets is fleeing the country to pursue postgraduate degrees and 
jobs in the united states and europe a brain drain expected to 
hinder brazils development for decades 
dr paulo alvim secretary general of the education ministry 
estimates that the deteriorating system will adversely affect the 
quality of the labor pool and slow the nations progress in 
scientific fields 
the educational deterioration has a devastating social 
impact alvim added young people are losing touch with society 
and their leaders leading them into the black holes of drugs 
alcohol and crime by allowing our school system to deteriorate we 
are in effect creating a marginal population that will eventually 
strain the governments social programs 
the rising cost of education even though teachers salaries 
remain low is another area of difficulty 
last year students protesting tuition increases clashed with 
police in major cities 
the system simply cant get any worse than it is now weve 
hit absolute rock bottom said fatima cunha secretary general of 
education in rio de janeiro state 
according to a united nations survey brazil which has the 
western worlds eighthlargest economy has one of the highest 
illiteracy rates in south america 27 percent in 1988 up from 25 
percent in 1986 it is believed to have risen even further in 1989 
brazil a nation of 150 million people had been making headway 
against illiteracy 
according to alvim illiteracy in brazil had been declining 
progressively since 1872 when the rate was 83 percent fifty 
percent of the population was illiterate in 1950 in 1960 40 
percent of brazilians were illiterate 
a unicef study released in december said brazil had the seventh 
highest grade school dropout rate in the world behind only haiti 
yemen chad the central african republic bangladesh and burma it 
said only 23 percent of pupils completed grade school in 198587 
although the law requires children to remain in school until they 
are 18 
about 27 million elementary school students are attending 
private and public schools nationwide only 34 million students 
attend public and private high schools and 15 million are enrolled 
in private and public universities 
a recent survey by the brazilian institute of public opinion and 
statistics found other dark spots in the educational system 
eleven percent of high school teachers have not finished grade 
school in several states in the poor northeast the rate is 40 
percent 
nearly threequarters of the countrys school buildings are 
unfit for use 
blame for the crisis is placed essentially on brazils plunge 
since the mid1970s into the worst economic crisis in its history 
it now has a 110 billion foreign debt a 1765 percent annual 
inflation rate and an economy in stagnation 
the government spends just 28 percent of revenue on education 
roughly the equivalent of 98 billion compared with an average 
of 4 percent in the rest of latin america 
the us federal outlay for education not counting state and 
municipal expenditures was about 22 billion for 1988 
even though brazilian government outlays for education already 
were low officials recently cut by 40 percent the money allocated 
for public universities and special education programs and federal 
funds often get lost in huge state bureaucracies and never reach 
the classroom secretary general cunha of the rio ministry said 
presidentelect fernando collor de mello a conservative who 
takes office march 15 has pledged to build schools and spend more 
on education but with 90 percent of federal revenues now earmarked 
for government employees salaries there isnt much likely to be 
available anytime soon for schools 
grammar and high school teachers in major cities earn the 
equivalent of 100 a month in outlying areas of the poor 
northeast such as in the village of jerumenha in maranhao state 
grade school teachers make just 6 a month 
many teachers give extra night classes to make extra money 
others sell perfume jewelry and jeans in school hallways during 
class breaks 
its hard to look your students in the eye afterwards said 
maria luiza de vitergo 29 a high school history teacher youre 
supposed to be their role model not a peddler

get the same editions of textbooks if they are available 
still private school tuition shot up 524 percent from january 
to june last year three times faster than the inflation rate 
students across the country held protest marches and tv news 
reports almost nightly showed riot troops clashing with teenagers 
spiraling tuition costs have led to an exodus of students from 
private to public schools further straining the system 
in rio de janeiros upper middleclass flamengo district half 
of the oncereputable amaro cavalcanti high school building was 
condemned because of cracked walls and ceilings electrical 
failure rats in classrooms and broken stairways said angela 
blemiro the public schools principal however classes are still 
held there 
last year strikes by teachers and school employees brought 
classes to a halt for up to six months in some states 
in the southeastern state of sao paulo strikes forced the 
states education council to give 1800 students high school 
degrees without their having completed the term 
there were no teachers to give classes explained wagner 
rossi the sao paulo state secretary general of education the 
students cannot be penalized for that 
the miserable wages and long work hours discourage teachers from 
giving their best said francilio pinto paes leme general 
secretary of the 25000member teachers union in rio de janeiro 
a mediocrity pact exists between professors who fake teaching 
students who fake learning and school employees who fake working 
said solange ikeda president of the federal university of mato 
grosso state 
most dropouts leave school to help support their families in a 
country where 73 percent of the work force makes less than 180 a 
month the squeeze also makes college education impossible for all 
but the elite 
as a result some 4 million students nationwide are resorting to 
home radio and tv courses and earning grade school and high school 
equivalency diplomas through the mail 
one program on globo tv the nations largest network offers 
courses at 630 am and 830 pm to allow high school students 
who work to study at home at semesters end final exams are 
mailed to the education ministry for grading 
the program has one of the networks highest ratings said jose 
renato monteiro president of the roberto marinho foundation 
created by media tycoon of that name 
tv is helping to bypass the crisis by filling a gap in the 
educational system monteiro said in an interview its a poor 
countrys solution to an old problem 
proponents of education reform are pushing state governors to 
decentralize city schools from the national network raise 
teachers salaries impose stricter standards for teachers and 
rebuild schools especially in the impoverished countryside 
education can be improved here said paes leme of the 
teachers union its a question of learning to set priorities 
straight

saints martyrs and spirits have been brought to 
life as chinas leaders try to teach their people to be good 
communists in these times of sinking fortunes for communism around 
the world 
the role model selfless hardworking plainliving and loyal 
unto death is a timehonored educational tool in communist china 
now as chinas hardline leaders seek absolute allegiance to a 
system where absolutes no longer exist the party has again called 
on its paragons to lead the way 
they are a counterweight both to the antiparty prowest 
sentiments of the crushed prodemocracy movement of tiananmen 
square last spring and the political changes that have swept 
eastern europe 
some like perfect soldier lei feng perennially return at times 
of ideological strife others such as the young martyr lai ning 
are newcomers to the party pantheon 
there are also ideals such as the spirit of yanan that 
hark back to a simpler day when party leaders sought to serve 
rather than corrupt and young people dedicated lives to socialist 
idealism rather than western materialism 
these are a few of the legends now in vogue 
lei feng 
nearly two decades after his death chinese today offer blood 
sweep streets and give free haircuts in the name of peasant soldier 
lei feng 
lei who according to a childrens song walks 1000 miles and 
does 1000 good deeds was killed in 1962 at age 22 when he 
backed his truck into a utility pole but a year later chairman mao 
tsetung proclaimed him a communist saint in the first of many 
campaigns titled learn from lei feng 
according to legend the fervent patriot secretly washed the 
clothes of his comrades donated his savings to help peasants hit 
by floods and once gave his coat to a woman and her child during a 
freezing rainstorm 
for his latest reincarnation the peoples liberation army has 
distributed 300000 copies of his diary with a view to launching 
a new upsurge in the army on learning from lei feng 
the pla daily newspaper of the peoples liberation army said 
some supporters of degenerate western bourgeois concepts have 
tried to denigrate lei by saying hes outdated but it added if 
all soldiers can be like lei feng have unparalleled loyalty to the 
party and the people and give matchless love to socialism then 
our army will become an indestructible steel great wall

model workers 
last fall 2000 model workers were assembled at the great hall 
of the people for the first national ceremony in three decades to 
honor such exemplars of labor 
the official press meanwhile is filled with tales such as the 
one of sweeper uncle jiang daoping a retired colonel and war 
hero who shot down seven enemy planes in the korean war but took a 
job as a janitor at shanghais tongji university after retiring 
his daughter worried she couldnt get a boyfriend with her 
father in such a lowly position tried to dissuade him but jiang 
reportedly replied it is no shame to do whatever i can for the 
society it will benefit both my body and soul 
then there is flying li songzhi a policewoman who at 52 
still leads a task force against pickpockets 
riding the bicycle at full speed i can keep up with a bus 
when a thief is riding on it she is quoted as saying in so 
doing i feel that i have regained my youth 
another is qiu tiandao a young army medic who reputedly is so 
skilled at acupuncture that he uses both hands to stick needles in 
two patients at the same time 
its my happiest thing to see the sufferings of the patients

war and natures caprice are conspiring to 
create food shortages that again threaten millions of people with 
starvation in ethiopia and sudan 
drought and the depredations wrought by two long civil wars have 
imperiled as many as 4 million people in northern ethiopia 
according to relief officials there 
similarly in neighboring sudan where as many as 250000 died of 
hunger in 198788 a resumption of fighting in a 6yearold civil 
war has raised fresh fears of another famine despite an extensive 
and by all accounts successful united nationsled relief 
operation last year 
men at war not nature have become the biggest threat to those 
in need with governments and guerrillas preventing a helpful 
international community from getting food to hungry peasants 
holding back the relief effort in ethiopia is the governments 
resistance to delivering food to people behind rebel lines in the 
rebellious province of eritrea and most particularly in the 
province of tigre leaving an untold number of people beyond the 
reach of aid agencies 
diplomats and relief workers fear that if a way is not found to 
feed these people ethiopia could suffer a repeat of the great 
famine of 198485 when as many as 1 million people died 
it has the potential if nothing is done about it said david 
morton the un world food programs representative in ethopia 
if food is not gotten in there in some way everyone is 
concerned well have a famine situation resulting from a drought 
situation said morton we cant say how many would die because 
we still dont know how many are affected but clearly very large 
numbers 
the united nations has appealed for an initial 700000 tons of 
emergency food aid about a third of which has been pledged by 
foreign donors more food may be needed if later assessments show 
the situation worsening 
morton says his agency recently began moving 60000 tons to 
distribution points in the northernmost province of eritrea much 
of which still remains in government hands 
tigre eritreas southern neighbor is the main problem morton 
says 
the province home to an estimated 26 million people is 
entirely in rebel hands and consequently inaccessible to relief 
agencies 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation front which has been 
fighting since 1975 to oust president mengistu haile mariam gained 
control of its home province early last year since august the 
rebels have made their greatest gains pushing southward and 
westward into neighboring provinces and moving ever closer to 
ethiopias capital addis ababa 
ethiopia has conscripted hundreds of thousands of men to fight 
the tigrean rebels who pose the greatest military threat to 
mengistus government 
relief officials nonetheless say they are encouraged by the 
governments recent request that several indigenous relief and 
church agencies study ways to get food to those behind rebel lines 
in tigre and report on their findings 
however there is the lurking fear that the government is not 
sincere about wanting to feed those it considers the rebels 
support base 
limited amounts of food can be moved to tigre through 
neighboring sudan 
but aid officials express a concern that if food shipments are 
not begun soon peasants will begin long and treacherous walks 
across embattled barren territory in search of food at 
governmentsanctioned distribution centers outside tigre 
weakened by their migration and lack of food and unable to 
return home the peasants could create vast overcrowded and 
unhygenic famine camps similar to those of 198485 in which more 
people died of disease than of starvation 
similar fears surrounded the 198788 relief operation when crop 
failures also threatened millions with starvation but during that 
emergency the government still had control of some of tigre and 
much of eritrea and food got through to those in need before mass 
migrations began 
we cant avoid drought but we can avoid famine morton said 
longterm prospects however are not encouraging 
weve got a situation of increasing population year after year 
and stagnant production of food said one aid official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity the longterm outlook on present 
trends isnt good 
in southern sudan the resumption of fighting between the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army and the government has derailed 
relief efforts credited with averting a repeat of the 1988 tragedy 
observers say the nearly 100000 tons of food ferried into the 
embattled region between april and november through corridors of 
tranquility staved off widespread death 
both warring parties declared a series of ceasefires to permit 
the shipments however that informal truce broke down in late 
october when fighting flared and in early november the government 
declared a ban on all relief flights saying it wanted to 
investigate the aerial bombing of a rebelheld town the sudan 
rebels have no planes 
bombings have continued in many southern towns being helped by 
the united nations and the government never happy about food being 
given to areas under the rebels control has accused relief 
workers of delivering arms ammunition and spare parts under the 
cover of humanitarian aid 
although sudans military leadership has promised a conference 
to consider allowing the resumption of relief flights aid workers 
fear the worst 
unless we continue our efforts through the next season 
southern sudan could fall back to a lifethreatening situation 
said vincent oreilly spokesman for the unled operation 
lifeline sudan 
ironically nature has provided the region with plenty of rain 
given tools and seeds the peasants could grow nearly twice as 
much food this year as was delivered by the emergency operation 
oreilly said 
in its second phase he added operation lifeline sudan planned 
to deliver 2 million worth of seeds and hand tools but the 
fighting has made this impossible leaving the region in a perilous 
state he said 
the food deliveries have maintained people in place 
oreilly said we have not addressed the underlying agricultural 
problem and the impact of the war 
unless we do we could face a return to a famine situation

one thing about your federal income tax return 
never changes you can bet it will never be the same from one year 
to the next 
this year is no exception there are changes affecting children 
as young as 2 and others that will alter the returns of millions of 
retirees there are new forms as well as changes in some familiar 
ones 
all taxpayers will find the bottom line their actual tax 
liability is slightly below what it would have been without some 
of the changes enacted in 1986 including inflation adjustments 
that are still taking effect 
here is a look at some of the changes 
exemptions this is 2000 for 1989 returns up 50 from 1988 a 
taxpayer is allowed one for himself or herself another for a 
spouse and one for each dependent who was alive for at least one 
day last year and meets certain tests a parent may no longer claim 
a fulltime student 24 or older whose income is 2000 or more 
standard deductions a single person who does not itemize 
deductions may claim a standard deduction of 3100 up 100 from 
last year because of inflation for a couple filing a joint return 
the deduction is 5200 for a married person filing separately 
2600 a qualified head of household 4550 a single taxpayer or 
head of household is allowed another 750 if at least 65 years old 
or blind or 1500 if both a couple gets another 600 for each 
spouse who is blind or at least 65 or 2400 if both are blind and 
at least 65 
tax brackets to offset inflationcaused bracket creep the 
brackets have been widened by about 4 percent so that more income 
is taxed at lower rates 
social security number you must list on your return the social 
security number of any dependent child who was 2 or older in 1989 
this requirement which previously applied only to children 5 or 
over is aimed at preventing both separated parents from claiming 
an exemption for the same child 
catastrophic coverage this medical program and the special 
surtax that helped finance it have been repealed ignore the lines 
on your return that refer to the surtax 
mileage the deductible mileage allowance for unreimbursed use 
of a personal car for business is up to 24 cents a mile for the 
first 15000 miles driven in 1989 and 11 cents for subsequent 
travel rates for mileage driven for charitable and medical 
purposes remain at 12 and 9 cents respectively 
telephone you may no longer deduct as a jobrelated expense any 
part of the basic monthly charge for your home telephone a second 
phone line may still be deductible 
interest deduction only 20 percent of consumer interest 
credit cards automobile loans education loans and the like paid 
in 1989 may be deducted there is a separate limit on interest paid 
to buy taxable investments you may deduct investment interest 
totaling up to the amount of net investment income plus 1000 for 
a married person filing a separate return and 2000 for all other 
filers 
earnedincome credit this benefit for lowincome working 
families with children has been raised to a maximum tax saving of 
910 with some credit allowed until income reaches 19340 
childcare credit two new restrictions on this credit which 
helps pay expenses of caring for children so parents may hold a 
job the credit now is available only if the child is under age 13 
any employerpaid reimbursement for child care must be subtracted 
from the expenses on which the credit is calculated 
child taxpayers a parent may file on his or her return the 
income of a child and thus free the child from filing under 
these conditions the child had not yet turned 14 on jan 1 1990 
had income of more than 500 and less than 5000 and all of it was 
from interest and dividends had no tax withheld and made no 
estimated tax payments in 1989

inflation adjustments to the tax system have 
freed many lowerincome workers from having to file a 1989 tax 
return 
whether you must file a return depends on your family status and 
your income a 50 boost in the personal exemption and automatic 
increases in the standard deductions to offset inflation have 
raised the maximum amount of gross income that a person may earn 
without filing a return 
the general filing thresholds are determined by adding the 
number of 2000 personal exemptions and the standard deduction to 
which an individual or couple is entitled the additional deduction 
permitted a blind person is not considered in the calculation 
here are the basic filing thresholds for each type of return 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
single you must file a return if your 1989 gross income subject 
to tax was 5100 or more if you were 65 or older last year the 
threshold is 5850 
married filing jointly if both spouses are under 65 the 
threshold is 9200 if one is 65 or older 9800 if both are at 
least 65 10400 the couple must have been living together at 
yearend and neither may be claimed as a dependent on another 
persons return 
married filing separately you must file if income was 2000 
or more 
head of household if you are under 65 file if income was at 
least 6550 if older the threshold is 7300 
the lower tax rates of this filing status are open to any person 
who was unmarried on the last day of 1989 and who paid more than 
half the cost of maintaining for the full year the principal home 
of at least one qualified relative that includes a child 
grandchild parent grandparent aunt uncle niece nephew or 
inlaw cousins dont count 
qualifying widow you must file if you are under 65 and income 
was at least 7200 7800 if you are 65 or older if your spouse 
died in 1987 or 1988 and you did not remarry by the end of 1989 
you may use the taxsaving jointreturn rates if 
you paid more than half the cost of maintaining for the full 
year the principal home for a child you were entitled to claim as a 
dependent and 
you were entitled to file a joint return the year your spouse 
died 
if your spouse died in 1989 and you did not remarry during the 
year you are entitled to file a regular joint return the same is 
true if your spouse died in 1990 before filing a return 
a separate set of rules applies to a taxpayer who can be claimed 
as a dependent by another in that case you must file a return if 
you had no unearned income such as interest and dividends and 
your earnings were 3100 or more 
you are married and 65 or older and had unearned income of at 
least 1100 if you are unmarried and 65 or older with some 
unearned income you must file once total income tops 1250 any 
person under age 65 with any unearned income must file if total 
income is 500 or more 
there are still more ifs ands and buts regardless of all those 
thresholds you still must file a return if 
you had net selfemployment earnings of at least 400 
you received any advance earnedincome credit in your paychecks 
you owe any special taxes such as the alternative minimum tax 
a tax on premature withdrawals from an individual retirement 
account or social security tax you did not report to your employer 
even if your income is low enough that you do not have to file 
you still must file if taxes were withheld and you want a refund 
you also must file to receive the earnedincome credit

you dont necessarily give up your children as 
dependents for tax purposes just because they have jobs of their 
own 
it depends on their income and living expenses 
each dependent claimed can reduce taxes by 560 for someone in 
the 28 percent bracket but the rules for qualifying can be so 
complicated that many taxpayers miss the chance to make claims to 
which they are entitled 
there are five basic tests for determining whether someone is 
your dependent all five must be met 
relationship a dependent must have lived with you throughout 
1989 except for being temporarily absent for school military 
service vacation or illness or must be a relative relative 
includes child grandchild stepchild parent grandparent 
brother sister uncle aunt nephew niece or inlaw livein 
lover yes so long as the relationship does not violate local law 
income generally a dependent must have gross income under 
2000 not counting such taxexempt income as welfare benefits or 
the nontaxable portion of social security note that is gross 
income for example an elderly parent who made 2500 in a 
parttime job would not qualify even if expenses of earning that 
money reduced net income below 2000 
the rules are more liberal where your children are concerned 
there is no limit to the income your child may earn and still 
qualify as your dependent if

he or she was under 19 at the end of 1989 or 
he or she was a fulltime student and under 24 last year 
fulltime means enrolled with a full class load during any five 
months of the year a government onfarm training course also 
qualifies 
citizenship the dependent must be a us citizen or resident 
alien or a resident of canada or mexico your adopted child need 
not be a us citizen but could have lived with you in 1989 in a 
foreign country 
no joint return a married person you claim as a dependent may 
not file a joint return again there is an exception if neither 
spouse is required to file but a joint return is filed to get a 
refund of withheld taxes you may claim the dependent 
support you must have provided more than half the dependents 
financial support last year 
first the exceptions if you and someone else together pay more 
than half the support of a dependent but no one exceeds 50 percent 
you may claim the dependent by contributing more than 10 percent 
and having the others sign form 2120 multiple support declaration 
in case of divorce or separation if you are the parent without 
custody of a child you may list the child as a dependent if the 
other parent agrees in writing to give up the claim or if a 
pre1985 agreement or decree gave you the right to claim the child 
to figure whether the support test was met you will have to 
determine what the dependent received from other sources including 
his or her own income and note that although nontaxable income 
does not figure into the calculation of the dependents income 
mantioned above it does count here that is taxexempt interest 
for example must be included when the dependent calculates total 
resources used for his or her own support 
some items of support are obvious shelter food clothing 
transportation including purchase of a car medical expenses 
including insurance education and childcare services 
other items that might be overlooked include charitable 
contributions on behalf of the dependent cosmetics pets toys 
tobacco beer gifts spending money and even the cost of a 
wedding 
you may not count as support such items as life insurance 
premiums scholarships and income and social security taxes 
remember that any dependent 2 or older must have a social 
security number which must be entered on your tax return obtain a 
number by filing form ss5 with the social security administration 
if you have mailed that form but havent received a number by the 
time you are ready to file your tax return write applied for

despite the best efforts of congress to move 
more taxpayers to the standard deduction itemizing is still a 
better deal for millions of couples and individuals 
unless other considerations such as time recordkeeping and 
general frustration are more important than money you should 
itemize if your deductions exceed the standard deduction that is 
5200 for a couple filing a joint return 3100 for a single 
person 4550 for a qualified head of household and 2600 for a 
married person filing separately 
congress reduced or eliminated some widely used deductions as 
the price for cutting tax rates across the board in the 1986 tax 
overhaul because of those changes the share of tax returns 
itemizing deductions dropped from 395 percent in 1987 to 333 
percent in 1988 
that percentage probably fell again on returns filed last year 
because of a continuing phaseout of the deduction for consumer 
interest that deduction which includes automobile and education 
loans and creditcard interest dropped to 20 percent in 1989 will 
be 10 percent for interest paid this year and will reach zero in 
1991 
for most people the biggest deduction is for home mortgage 
interest and remains unchanged from last year your mortgage 
interest is fully deductible if 
the mortgages on your principal home were taken out on or 
before oct 13 1987 or 
any mortgages taken out after that date were used only to buy 
build or improve your principal home and they totaled 1 million or 
less in all of 1989 or if 
any mortgages taken out after that date were used for purposes 
other than home purchase building or improvement and totaled 
100000 or less last year 
publication 936 free from the irs will be helpful if part of 
your mortgage is not deductible or if you own two or more homes 
points paid to obtain a mortgage may be deducted fully in one 
year only if the loan was used to buy or improve your main home and 
the home was used as security you paid the points from funds other 
than the loan if points are customarily charged in your area and 
if what you paid is not out of line with the usual fee 
otherwise the points must be deducted gradually over the life 
of the loan 
other deductions 
medical unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7 percent of 
adjusted gross income these can range from the usual fees paid to 
physicians dentists and christian science practitioners but not 
scientology counselors to prescribed exercise equipment limited 
lodging expenses for outoftown care and sometimes even the cost 
of a wig 
contributions donations to irsrecognized charities generally 
are fully deductible if total contributions are no more than 50 
percent of adjusted gross income you may deduct up to 30 percent 
of agi for contributions of money or ordinaryincome property as

congress has tightened the rules on tax 
benefits for workrelated expenses of caring for a child 
there is no longer a credit for expenses of caring for a child 
who was 13 or older last year unless the child was disabled the 
old limit was 15 
any taxfree payments your employer provided for care of your 
dependents must be subtracted from the expenses on which the 
childcare credit is calculated 
you may not claim the credit or exclude from income any 
employerpaid childcare benefit unless you fully identify on your 
return including social security or employer number the person or 
group that took care of your child 
if you file the long form 1040 calculate your childcare 
benefits on form 2441 if you file the shorter form 1040a use part 
1 to accompany that form 
the childcare credit can reduce your tax bill by as much as 
1440 if your qualify 
who qualifies in general a taxpayer who in order to work or 
seek work must hire someone to care for a dependent child who is 
disabled or under age 13 or for any other dependent or spouse who 
is physically or mentally incapable of selfcare 
what kind of work fulltime or parttime for someone else or 
in your own business you or your spouse must have had earnings 
during 1989 a spouse can meet the work requirement if he or she 
was a fulltime student during a part of each of five months last 
year 
what expenses services necessary to run your home even if only 
part of the expense was for the benefit of your dependent and 
services needed to care for the dependent this includes services 
of a cook maid or housekeeper the irs says but not a gardener or 
chauffeur dont include clothing or entertainment expenses 
you may include expenses of nursery school or day care outside 
your home if your child is under 13 however if the child is in 
first grade or higher you must claim only the portion of the 
expense that covers child care not the cost of education 
if you are paying for the care of one child or other dependent 
your credit is calculated on qualified expenses of up to 2400 
for two or more dependents the maximum is 4800 you may not 
count expenses that exceed your earned income if you are married 
and filing jointly the total of qualified expenses is limited to 
your or your spouses earnings whichever is smaller 
however if you used taxexcluded employerprovided dependent 
care last year you must subtract its value from the qualified 
expenses used to figure the credit thus for example if you had 
4500 of expenses for the care of two children and your employer 
provided 2500 worth of care you may not use more than 2000 of 
expenses for calculating the credit 
the maximum credit for 30 percent of childcare expenses is 
available only to those with adjusted gross income of 10000 or 
less as outlined on form 2441 and on part 1 of form 1040a the 
credit declines as income rises to a minimum of 20 percent for 
those with adjusted gross income over 28000 
theres another bit of red tape for many who claim the credit 
paying someone to care for a dependent in your home could make you 
liable for social security and unemployment taxes on that persons 
wages 
you must withhold social security tax if you pay a household 
employee wages of 50 or more in a quarter you should have 
withheld 751 percent and matched it from your own pocket in 1989 
and turned the money over to the government with form 942 
paying 1000 or more during a quarter for household help means 
you must pay an unemployment tax of up to 62 percent of the 
workers wages 
see irs publication 503 for more information on the childcare 
credit and publication 926 for details of your liabilities as an 
employer

the new inflationproofing of the tax 
system means a slightly lower burden for most taxpayers 
a single person with taxable income after deductions and 
exemptions of 29000 for example would have owed 5807 in tax 
without the annual inflation adjustment to the tax brackets 
instead the bill will be 5716 a saving of 2 percent 
a couple filing a joint return with 35000 taxable income will 
owe 5784 for 1989 3 percent less than the 5940 liability they 
would have faced without the inflation adjustment 
the adjustment was made by taxing an additional 4 percent of 
income at a lower rate 
for example the top of the lowest bracket 15 percent which 
is the only rate paid by about 8 of every 10 taxpayers was raised 
for joint returns from 29750 for 1988 to 30950 for 1989 for 
single people the 15 percent rate applies to 18550 of 1989 
taxable income up from 17850 in 1988 
in addition to the savings associated with widening the tax 
brackets taxpayers also are paying less because the personal 
exemptions have been increased and the standard deductions have 
been indexed to offset inflation 
the changes were voted as part of the tax overhaul enacted in 
1986

forget all that talk you heard last year about 
expanding individual retirement accounts the ira rules for your 
1989 tax return are basically the same as a year ago 
that means fully deductible iras are available only for 
lowerincome workers and for those with higher incomes who are not 
covered by a company pension other workers will have to do some 
paperwork to see if they are eligible for a partial deduction 
nondeductible ira contributions are still allowed but require 
filing a form 8606 
a worker who qualifies for a full deduction may set aside in an 
ira up to 100 percent of 1989 wages or 2000 whichever is 
smaller a limited separate deduction may be claimed for a spouse 
who earned 250 or less in either case no tax is paid on the 
contribution or interest it earns until withdrawn at age 59 or 
later 
your eligibility for any deductible ira contribution depends on 
your income and marital status and whether you are covered by a 
company pension you are not allowed to contribute to an ira for 
1989 if you were 70 or older at yearend 
to determine your eligibility for a deductible contribution two 
figures are important 
the first is your modified adjusted gross income if you are 
filing form 1040a that means wages salaries and tips line 7 
for 1040 it means total income minus the adjustments on lines 26 
through 29 
the second figure is the phaseout level for a single person or 
unmarried head of household this is 35000 for a couple filing 
jointly it is 50000 for a married person filing a separate 
return it is 10000 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you get no deduction if you or your spouse if you file jointly 
are covered by a company pension and income exceeds the phaseout 
level 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you are eligible for a fully deductible ira if 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
neither you nor your spouse if you are filing jointly is 
covered by a company pension your income doesnt matter 
or if you or your spouse are covered by a company plan and 
adjusted gross income before calculating the ira falls at least 
10000 below the phaseout 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you are allowed a partial deduction if income is less than 
10000 above the phaseout the deduction is 20 percent of the 
difference between the two figures 
a single person with income of 30000 would subtract that from 
35000 the phaseout multiply the 5000 difference by 20 and 
claim a 1000 deduction 
note that if both spouses had earnings and contributed to an ira 
in 1989 they must use separate worksheets to figure their 
deductions however the calculations and the phaseout are 
based on the couples combined incomes 
for example mary earned 21000 and john earned 20000 a 
combined income of 41000 each calculates the allowable ira 
deduction by subtracting 41000 from 50000 and multiplying the 
remaining 9000 by 20 that results in a 1800 maximum deduction 
for each spouse 
if one spouse earned 250 or less a different calculation is 
required assuming mary had zero income and john earned 41000 
the couple would subtract 41000 from 50000 and multiply the 
remaining 9000 by 225 
that would yield a total deduction of 2025 which could be 
divided any way between the spouses so long as neither took more 
than 1800 the maximum allowed for a 41000ayear couple 
the irs allows you when calculating a partial deduction to 
round up to the next 10 thus 301 becomes 310 if the figure is 
between zero and 200 round it up to 200 
if you dont qualify for a full deduction you still may make a 
nondeductible contribution to your ira although there is no 
immediate tax benefit interest earned on the contribution will 
remain taxfree until withdrawn 
limits for a nondeductible contribution are the same as for 
deductible deposits 
you report a nondeductible contribution by filing the onepage 
form 8606 with your return keep a copy of that form for the 
future when you begin withdrawing from your ira the irs will 
consider all the money taxable unless you can prove some of it 
the nondeductible deposits already has been taxed 
an ira contribution for 1989 may be made any time before the 
april 16 1990 deadline for filing a return

910 a 
year to lowerincome working families with children 
its called the earnedincome credit and a qualifying worker can 
even receive the benefit in advance as part of his or her weekly 
paycheck the maximum credit of 910 is available only to families 
with income between 6500 and 10250 but some benefit can be 
claimed until income reaches 19340 
you may qualify if you meet all these tests 
you have at least one child who lived with you more than half 
of 1989 or for the entire year if you file as a qualifying widow 
or widower 
you had earned income wages tips or selfemployment earnings 
of less than 19340 last year 
your adjusted gross income total income subject to tax minus 
alimony employee business expenses and similar adjustments was 
under 19340 
you file a joint return as head of household or qualifying 
widow or widower with dependent child 
there are different rules applying to each of the three filing 
statuses check free irs publication 596 for details 
you may calculate the credit yourself by using the special 
worksheet and the earnedincomecredit table in your tax 
instructions or the irs will figure the credit for you see

nearly 3 million retired couples and 
individuals will have to pay federal income tax on as much as half 
their 1989 social security benefits 
whether any part of your social security is taxable depends on 
your total income and your filing status you are affected if your 
total income including half your benefits and all taxexempt 
interest exceeds 
32000 if you are married and filing a joint return 
25000 if you are single or married and did not live with 
your spouse at any time last year 
zero if you claim any other filing status 
here is an example of how to make the calculation the example 
assumes a couple filing a joint return with 7500 in social 
security benefits other income totaling 32000 and income 
adjustments of 2400 
add half your social security 3250 to your other income 
including taxexempt interest 32000 35250 
subtract adjustments listed on lines 24 through 30 on form 
1040 such as alimony paid 2400 that leaves 32850 
subtract the threshold for a couple filing jointly 32000 
that leaves 850 if you get zero or less here none of your 
social security is taxable 
take half of 850 425 
compare that 425 with the 3250 representing half your social 
security benefits you pay tax on the smaller 425 write that 
figure on line 21b of form 1040 your total benefits must be listed 
on line 21a 
the government should send you by jan 31 a form ssa1099 
showing social security benefits you were paid last year the 
important figure is in box 5 
use the same rules and computations if you received railroad 
retirement benefits in that case you should receive form rrb1099 
in the mail 
special rules apply if you repaid any social security benefits 
last year publication 915 free from the irs explains this and 
other details of determining if any portion of your benefits is 
taxable

the internal revenue service is a silent 
partner when you sell your principal home 
the irs must be notified of the sale through the filing of a 
form 1099s which is usually done by the settlement agent but 
you the seller must file form 2119 with your tax return even if 
you lost money on the sale 
in general capital gains from the sale of real estate stock or 
other investments are subject to tax at the same rates applying to 
wages and other income but there are two ways to avoid the bite 
when the gain is from the sale of your principal home 
if certain conditions are met any tax on the gain is deferred 
into the future so long as you buy a replacement home that costs at 
least as much as your old home sold for the replacement must be 
bought within 24 months before or 24 months after the old one is 
sold 
if your new one costs less than the adjusted selling price of 
your old home you pay tax on the profit from the sale or on the 
portion of the sales price that exceeds the cost of the new home 
whichever is less you reduce the tax bite by adjusting the sales 
price of the old home to reflect points fixup expenses real 
estate commissions and legal fees you paid 
deferral of gain on your home sale is not optional you must do 
it anytime you buy a principal home whose price equals or exceeds 
the adjusted sales price of your old one 
the tax is only deferred not forgiven any untaxed profit 
serves to reduce the cost for tax purposes of your new home 
thus when your new home is sold in the future any profit from 
that sale is calculated from a lower basis but taxation will 
continue to be postponed as many times as you replace an old home 
with one costing at least as much 
if you or your spouse if you are married are 55 or older 
you may avoid tax entirely on the first 125000 of profits but 
remember that you may exercise this option only once in your 
lifetime to qualify the property must have been your principal 
home for at least three of the last five years before the sale 
special consideration is given a person 55 or older who becomes 
mentally or physically incapable of selfcare during the fiveyear 
period before the home sale in such a case the residency 
requirement is considered met if up to four of the five years are 
spent in a nursing home 
if you sold your principal home in 1989 irs publication 523 
offers detailed advice on how to report the sale on form 2119 and 
how to calculate and report any gain on 1040 schedule d if you 
lost money on the sale the loss is not deductible

medicare beneficiaries should ignore the lines 
on their 1989 tax returns that refer to the surtax for catastrophic 
health insurance 
the program and the surtax that eventually would have financed 
most of it were repealed by congress in november several weeks 
after the tax forms had gone to the printer the surtax was 
repealed retroactively to jan 1 1989 when it first took effect 
the internal revenue service says taxpayers should skip line 54 
on form 1040 and line 23 on 1040a also they should ignore 
references to form 8808 and schedule 2 on which the surtax was to 
have been calculated because those forms do not exist 
only about 40 percent of retirees those whose incomes were 
high enough that they had total federal income tax liability of at 
least 150 were liable for the surtax in 1989 no one knows how 
many of those who were liable actually paid any of the tax either 
by having it withheld from wages or by making quarterly estimated 
payments 
those who paid the surtax can get it back when they file their 
returns by subtracting it from taxes owed 
this would mean an added burden for retirees whose incomes are 
low enough that they are not required to file a return however 
they will have to file to get a refund of the surtax 
the 4amonth catastrophic premium paid by almost all medicare 
beneficiaries also was repealed but not retroactively 
the government has a plan for refunding any of these premiums 
that continue to be collected in the first few months of 1990 but 
those refunds will not be made through the tax system thus the 
premiums should not be listed on the tax return

the alternative minimum tax is no longer a 
concern for just the rich 
middleincome taxpayers who have investments in oil gas 
minerals or real estate who last year sold property on an 
installment plan or who made a sizable donation of appreciated 
property to charity may find themselves liable for the 21 percent 
tax 
the levy was created to ensure that people with a sizable amount 
of income pay some tax even though they have significant deductions 
and credits in essence the minimum tax reduces the value of some 
specific deductions 
under the latest rules a couple filing a joint return may be 
liable for the tax if adjusted gross income and those targeted 
deductions exceed 40000 for a single person the threshold is 
30000 
the only way to determine for sure whether you must pay the tax 
instead of your regular income tax is to read and complete form

its ok to squirrel away your tax refund but 
be sure you cash the check first 
under a new government policy a federal check expires if not 
cashed within a year 
some tips that could increase or expedite your refund or help 
you avoid a misstep on filling out your return 
when adding up your medical expenses dont forget automobile 
expenses at the rate of 9 cents a mile or actual outlays for gas 
and oil in either case you may add parking fees and tolls 
you get no deduction for time donated to a charity but again 
dont forget auto expenses this time its 12 cents a mile or 
actual outlays plus fees and tolls 
costs of education related to your job may be deductible but 
not if courses prepare you for a new job or enable you to meet the 
minimum requirements of your field claim the deduction if the 
schooling is required by law or by your employer or if it improves 
your skills in your present job see form 2106 
did you receive pay as a juror in 1989 whether or not you 
itemize you may deduct jury pay that you turned over to your 
employer in exchange for having your full wages continue while you 
served 
use line 28 on form 1040 to avoid tax on penalties you paid for 
early withdrawals from a savings account 
interest earned on series e or ee savings bonds is taxable but 
you dont have to report it as income until a bond matures or you 
redeem it whichever is earlier 
if you suffered a casualty loss in 1989 in a disaster that 
prompted designation of a federal disaster area you may claim the 
loss on the return you are filing now or the one you filed a year 
ago the latter option which could result in a greater tax saving 
would require filing of an amended 1988 return on form 1040x 
the most common mistake is one of the easiest to avoid if you 
are not an itemizer be sure to claim the right standard deduction 
for your filing status and copy the correct figure when you read 
across the tax tables to find your tax liability 
the irs allows you to simplify your return by rounding for 
example 20149 becomes 201 and 20378 becomes 204 but you may 
round off only the totals not the individual items you add to 
reach a total 
the law says you have not filed a return unless it is signed 
you could face a 500 penalty for filing a return that does not 
include basic information necessary to determine your tax 
liability and even if you feel the need to protest dont cross 
out or alter the under penalties of perjury declaration just 
above the signature line that would void the return 
keep all records pertaining to your taxes for at least three 
years records on the sale purchase or improvement of property 
including your home should be kept permanently as should 
paperwork on your individual retirement account 
file schedule b for form 1040 or schedule 1 for 1040a if 
you received taxable interest or dividends exceeding 400 
the irs needs to know how much taxexempt interest you received 
last year it should be listed on line 8b dont include interest 
earned on your individual retirement account 
not having a w2 earnings statement is no excuse for not filing 
a return ask your employer for it 
the sequence numbers listed under 1989 in the upper right 
corner of your tax forms tell you in what order the supplemental 
forms and schedules should be attached to your 1040 
no matter what you have heard the experts say using the 
stickon label on your return does not make it easier for the irs 
to nail you for an audit it just makes it easier to process the 
return through a computer 
if you are selfemployed and showed a net profit last year you 
may deduct on line 26 of form 1040 up to 25 percent of what you 
paid for health insurance for yourself and your family 
investors in enterprises that generate losses may be subject to 
a whole new set of tax rules in general a loss from a passive 
activity something in which you do not materially participate may 
not be used to avoid taxes on nonpassive income such as wages 
check irs publication 925 
if you deduct alimony payments your return must show the 
social security number of the recipient the recipients return 
must show your number

no matter how hard you try theres still a 
chance you will make a mistake on your tax return and dont 
realize it until you have filed what then 
whether you failed to report interest on a savings account or 
neglected to take advantage of a deduction you need to file an 
amended return form 1040x in general you have three years from 
the date your return was mailed to file an amended return or you 
forfeit any credit or refund 
some other common problems 
you cant get your records together in time to meet the april 
16 filing deadine file form 4868 which gives you an automatic 
fourmonth extension of filing time but you still must estimate 
your taxes and submit with form 4868 a check for the total 
you have no trouble filing but you dont have the money to pay 
your balance again dont put off filing pay as much of the 
balance as you can and note on your return or a separate sheet of 
paper that you are unable to complete paymwent at the moment this 
does not guarantee the internal revenue service will grant an 
extension but you may be able to work out an installment plan 
either way you will have avoided being penalized for not filing a 
return 
you made no mistake in fact you are getting a big refund 
thats not necessarily good remember the refund represents money 
you have been lending the government interestfree if you want to 
reduce the refund file an amended w4 form with your employer 
theres no refund in fact you owe the treasury a big chunk 
again you may need to amend your w4 or if a good part of your 
income is from investments which are not subject to withholding 
you may need to make quarterly payments of your estimated taxes as 
a rule you must make quarterly payments if you expect to owe the 
irs 500 or more a year from now 
you sent in an application to get a social security number for 
your 2yearold but still havent received it write applied

if government calculations are correct and you

minutes to complete a basic form 1040 and a schedule a for itemized 
deductions 
chances are that if you make 30000 a year and your most exotic 
investment is a certificate of deposit at your neighborhood bank 
you will find those estimates unrealistic the same might be said 
for a millionaire with a lot of investment interest and a number of 
stock trades 
useless as the exercise may be the irs is required by the white 
house office of management and budget to estimate the time needed 
to fill out each tax form 
the shortest time is required for the singlepage form 1040ez 
which is available only to single people with taxable income under 
50000 irs estimates such a taxpayer will spend 5 minutes keeping 
records 18 minutes learning about the form 30 minutes preparing 
it and 27 minutes copying the form and mailing it to the irs 
a filer of form 1040a and schedule 1 for childcare benefits 
will spend 9 hours 10 minutes on average

professional to prepare and file your return 
the irs will mail your check or deposit it electronically into 
your bank account or you may elect to let the irs keep all or part 
of the refund to apply against your 1990 liability 
the irs likes electronic processing because it saves time and 
money and minimizes errors paper returns require irs clerks to 
type large amounts of data into computers just one typo every 100 
returns would mean a million errors to find and correct the manual 
paperwork and data processing can take several weeks

telephone lines into an irs computer the irs may view the return 
on a computer screen or print it on paper within two days the irs

that is not a wise choice for many taxpayers you could save 
money by filing form 1040a or the long form 1040 
here are the basic rules 
1040ez only for single taxpayers who are neither blind nor past 
their 65th birthday and had taxable income after subtracting the

no matter what you make if youre able to put aside anything 
for savings youre proabably in a tax bracket that will make 
taxfree municipal bonds attractive says a specialist in these 
issues 
michael s appelbaum first vice president at shearson lehman 
hutton in new york city advises wage earners to balance these safe 
investments with higher yielding taxable moneymarket instruments 
municipals he points out are backed by the taxing power of 
cities and states and are among the safest investments around 
second only the us government bonds 
appelbaum notes that it doesnt take a huge income to end up in 
the top tax brackets for example a working couple filing a joint 
return of 29751 net taxable income in new york state but not 
living in new york city which has its own tax are in the combined 
federal and new york state tax bracket of 337 percent another 
couple in the same locale filing a joint return on 71901 will be 
in the top combined 386 percent bracket 
if youre in that top combined bracket and find an investment 
paying 9 percent youll end up with only 58 percent after paying 
out federal and state taxes on the investment in contrast a 
municipal bond might pay you 7 or 8 percent free of both federal 
and state taxes 
throughout the country even in states without income taxes 
the general rule is that 7 percent to 8 percent tax free in the top 
33 percent federal income tax bracket is like 104 percent to 119 
percent from a bank or other taxable investment says appelbaum 
he says the ratio between municipal bonds at 8 percent and 
taxable ginnie maes from the government national mortgage 
association at 10 percent works out to about 80 percent even 
though the municipal bond ostensibly pays 20 percent less than the 
ginnie mae in every tax bracket above 20 percent the takehome 
pay from the municipal bond beats the ginnie 
when choosing a bond appelbaum recommends looking at other 
factors besides the yield percentage if you need a bond you can 
cash in within a few years instead of letting it mature for 10 or 
20 years youll have to give up some yield if you want current 
income to live on and the best payout now then get the bonds with 
the highest interest rates he says youll get maximum return on 
your savings each time you clip a coupon or receive semiannual 
interest though you may have to pay a premium 
appelbaum suggests you consult with your accountant financial 
advisor or broker when picking bonds so they can recommend buys 
based on your needs some of the questions youll be considering 
when do you plan to retire do you have heirs how much are secure 
triplea ratings worth to you in cold cash are the bonds to be a 
gift are they for your childrens education are they being used 
to build up your estate are you living on the interest and will 
you leave the principal to your survivors should you reduce your 
estate and your estate taxes through an orderly invasion of your 
capital when do you need or want your principal back do you need 
income to live on spend or enjoy or are you in a position to 
defer current income and take a big lump sum when bonds mature 
appelbaum says resale of bonds before maturity will be affected 
by market conditions but points out that municipal bonds assure you 
of getting interest all along and your principal at the end

in the wake of the 1986 tax reform act insurance investments 
may be among the few which offer safe and substantial tax 
advantages 
annuities and whole life insurance earn interest for investors 
and provide taxfree dividends or taxdeferred growth says peter 
goodstein senior vice president of kornreich insurance services 
he advises investors to include both as longterm investments in 
their overall financial plans 
the tax benefits of both whole life insurance and annuities 
are hard to duplicate in other longterm investments says 
goodstein unlike taxfree bonds and mutual funds the underlying 
guaranteed value of insurance products doesnt fluctuate with the 
market so in many ways its a safer investment 
he points out that whole life insurance lets the investor 
accumulate cash which can remain liquid without penalty and in 
addition his death benefit can be structured so that his 
beneficiaries can receive policy proceeds tax free the cost of 
whole life insurance however must cover administration costs 
in contrast annuities are noload investments that sometimes 
have greater yields than treasuries or bank certificates of 
deposit however annuities are usually not structured as liquid 
assets and carry withdrawal penalties for investors under the age 
of 59 these might include a 10 percent penalty imposed by the 
irs the proceeds taxed as ordinary income and a further penalty 
by the insurance company 
goodstein says that as whole life insurance policies mature 
their cash value and death benefits increase dramatically he gives 
as an example a healthy nonsmoking 38yearold male who buys 
250000 worth of whole life insurance for a premium of 3253 a 
year assuming the dividends continue to be paid as projected in 
10 years the policy will have a cash value slightly over the total 
premium paid plus a death benefit over the original 250000 
after 20 years the cash value and death benefit will be what 
goodstein terms significantly in excess of the premium 
investment 
to help realize this growth consumers should never buy a 
polity from a life insurance company that is rated less than aplus by 
am best amp co he says 
if the investor chooses a deferred annuity one that reinvests 
monthly dividends 100000 invested at the age of 45 can come to 
6000 a month 20 years later also assuming interest rates stay at 
or near current levels in comparing annuity interest rates 
consumers should consider both the historical performance as well 
as projected levels goodstein says

if you own your own business its critical to map out a 
shareholders agreement to avoid confusion and potentially higher 
estate taxes when you die according to nahum gordon an attorney 
and estate planning specialist 
gordon a partner of moroze sherman gordon amp gordon a new 
yorkbased law firm says that without such an agreement in place 
surviving family members wont have a clear idea of how long they 
can draw your salary or how to cash in on the value of your shares 
other shareholders who may not be ready to buy out the shares 
but want to minimize the payout may not want your surviving 
spouse or children as partners in the business 
then theres uncertainty among employees creditors and banks 
who dont know what will happen next 
and in the absence of an agreement the internal revenue service 
can claim a high value and subsequent higher estate taxes on 
the shares some of the factors irs is likely to look at include 
the type and history of the business the economic outlook and the 
role of the specific industry involved the earning and 
dividendpaying capacities of your company an assessment of good 
will or other intangibles stock sales and the size of the block of 
stock to be valued and typical market prices of stocks of similar 
businesses whose shares are publicly traded 
gordon says there is no standard form of shareholders 
agreements but six major issues need to be considered when drawing 
one up 
whether your spouse or children will remain as shareholders 
or if shares owned by the estate can be purchased you need to 
judge if surviving family members can function effectively in the 
business and if other partners are amenable to your familys 
participation 
an established price or the method of arriving at one for 
your shares should you decide that your spouse and children will 
not remain as shareholders so that these shares can be bought in 
arms length transactions 
potential technical difficulties in tax estate and corporate 
laws resolve these in advance instead of leaving them to be dealt 
with under settlement pressure after your death 
additional benefits for your family if the proceeds of share 
sales wont meet their needs these can be in form of insurance 
deferred compensation plans or limited salary continuation plans 
adequate insurance to enable stock purchasers either family 
or the company to complete a buyout of the shares as spelled out 
in the agreement 
advance approval by banks or other thirdparty institutions 
whose consent will be needed to purchase or sell your shares after 
your death 
gordon says that the agreed purchase price usually will be 
conclusive except in some circumstances among closelyrelated 
parties

lillian goldberg spent 15 years as a teacher 
and administrator in new york city schools but developed her 
deepest relationships with students after she retired 
for the first time in my life ive been able to work with 
them on a oneonone basis and to help them follow their 
interests mrs goldberg 70 said of her work with youngsters in 
florida it opens up vistas of knowledge for me and i see the 
blossoming of the children 
in saugus mass 70yearold james brennans work helping young 
toughs get jobs and stay out of trouble keeps him going in his own 
battle against cancer 
undoubtedly this program has something to do with my mental 
and physical health brennan said i would hate to think that 
when one becomes a certain age theyre disposable that thought 
always plagued me 
in ann arbor mich 61yearold nancy perkins works with junior 
high schoolers who need a listening ear or a push with their 
homework 
you feel like youre doing something rather than sitting home 
wringing your hands about the dropout rate mrs perkins said 
the whole idea of linking youth and elders is really gaining a 
lot of momentum said nancy henkin director of the center for 
intergenerational learning at temple universitys institute on 
aging people are finally realizing that these are two groups 
that should get together 
with the elderly making up the fastestgrowing segment of 
society and the number of atrisk youth at 12 million and growing 
intergenerational matchups are something whose time has come 
henkin said 
one of the latest such ideas is mentoring in which older 
americans are paired with youngsters in oneonone relationships 
mentoring is distinguished from other intergenerational programs by 
development of deeper relationships between the adults and 
youngsters who need unconditional love encouragement and strong 
role models children who succeed against long odds often are those 
who have developed meaningful relationships with adults henkin 
said 
temple this month launched a 3 million linking lifetimes 
program financed by five foundations that will help nine 
communities set up mentoring projects pairing older people with 
young offenders and troubled youth the mentors paid a small 
stipend will spend at least two hours a week helping their 
partners with school job and life decisions 
in springfield mass for example retirees will help offenders 
aged 1417 finish school and steer clear of drugs and crime the 
mentors are in a unique position to help because theyre neither 
parents nor professionals said john tansey director of the 
project there these elders dont have to prove anything to the 
kids theyre there just for these kids and to listen 
in memphis tenn linking lifetimes will pair lowincome older 
women with pregnant seventh and eighthgraders director jane 
watkins sees it as a boon for the girls and mentors and a way to 
prevent abuse and neglect of the babies 
other linking lifetimes programs are being launched in los 
angeles miami st petersburg fla birmingham and montgomery 
ala hartford conn and syracuse ny the results will be 
evaluated by the california research center and publicprivate 
ventures a nonprofit corporation based in philadelphia that 
designs and evaluates social policy programs 
existing mentoring programs show promising results but there 
has been little research on their effectiveness henkin said 
while intergenerational mentoring programs are on the increase 
projects matching seniors with troubled youths are rarer said 
sandra sweeney of the american association of retired persons 
for the right kind of person its a terrific experience but 
there are more barriers to working with atrisk youth 
they may not share some of the same backgrounds or know how to 
approach kids who may have been in trouble 
one success story is the work connection based in saugus 
mass in which retirees paid a weekly salary based on caseload 
help young offenders find and hold jobs as an alternative to jail 
over the past four years more than 350 people have graduated 
from the program 
its amazing how the relationship evolves and develops said 
director kelly quinlan it never really stops because our 
participants still keep in touch with their mentors theyve made a 
permanent friend 
jack petrolopoulos former coordinator of the program said one 
match paired a tough greek immigrant with a 19yearold offender 
steve who had been arrested for a variety of crimes the mentor 
nick never gave up even though steve went through a string of 
jobs and even stole a watch from another mentor joe and denied 
it nick would see steve several times a week work with his 
employers and sometimes even roust him from bed and drive him to 
work 
steve eventually became a reliable employee and avoided further 
arrests prompting a judge to give him a suspended twoyear 
sentence for his earlier offenses perhaps as significantly steve 
presented a new watch to joe and told nick i know ive never 
said this but i dont know where id be if it wasnt for you guys 
i cant tell you how much i appreciate what youve done for me 
brennan a former fire chief has worked with about 65 young 
adults through the work connection in the past five years more 
than half successfully along with the successes however come the 
frustrations when someone lets him down 
youll have a couple clients that are doing real well and then 
youll pick up the daily paper and find out that one of them has 
committed an armed robbery he said i get terribly 
disappointed and frustrated its almost as though theyre one of 
your own family 
in michigan ann arbors tlc program teachinglearning 
communities arranges for senior mentors to meet at school each 
week with junior high school students who are in danger of dropping 
out or having other problems 
youngsters tell their mentors just the fact that youre here 
in this room gives me courage said carol tice who directs the 
program elders meanwhile know that their life has made a 
difference 
one mentor helped an angry and withdrawn 12yearold girl relate 
well to her peers and jump three years in reading skills another 
was able to steer a bright 15yearold girl into counseling after 
suicide themes started cropping in creative writing projects she 
did for him 
sixtyfiveyearold elly strauch a tlc mentor for nearly three 
years said she gets more from the program than she gives ive 
always loved teaching to be able to get back to it after 
retirement was really luckier than i ever thought id be theyre 
never going to dislodge me from tlc 
in florida the senior mentors for creative students program 
started in broward county in 1982 and has spread to 22 districts 
senior volunteers are paired with students with common interests 
who need additional challenges 
mrs goldberg the retired new york educator helped a broward 
county grade schooler research space law by visiting courthouses 
and judges and the girl later expressed interest in becoming a 
lawyer 
to help a youngster realize their own potential for creativity 
and their own ability to do something mrs goldberg said 
thats the wonder of it

of all the feats in the guinness book of world records being 
the oldest living person is perhaps the most tantalizing and 
the most open to dispute 
everyone after all is a potential contestant 
and nearly everyone at some point has yearned for the honor 
no single subject is more obscured by vanity deceit 
falsehood and deliberate fraud than the extremes of human 
longevity the guinness editors assert noting hundreds of claims 
of people over 100 and some insulting to the intelligence of 
people living into their third centuries 
yet few claims are harder to prove than extreme longevity 
after all no one else whos alive today was alive when the oldest 
old were born 
that is true of carrie white of palatka fla and jackson 
pollock of milledgeville ga the 1990 guinness book recognizes 
miss white as the oldest at 115 but since that book went to 
press pollock has emerged with the claim that he is 123 guinness 
is still awaiting proof 
the ages of these living ancients raise interesting questions 
how do we know theyre the oldest do they give us the hope of 
immortality a window into our past or are they like circus 
freaks fascinating only because they are so different so extreme 
aside from the question of proof longevity experts say the 
answers are all yes mainly people like the idea of someone 
cheating death 
nobody wants to stare at death its one way to confront death 
to consider not confronting it said dr richard sprott 
associate director for biomedical research and clinical medicine at 
the national institute on aging 
in carrie whites case there is fairly persuasive evidence she 
is 115 the search for pollocks past is fascinating but as yet 
inconclusive 
miss white lives at the putnam memorial nursing home where she 
likes to attend church and song sessions she is in good health 
though she doesnt seem to understand the fuss over her age and 
refuses to talk about her past 
hers is not a happy story from what little is known she is 
said to have been born nov 18 1874 in gadsden county fla as a 
young woman she married john white who was either a blacksmith or 
a farmer and on the day after her 35th birthday in 1909 he 
committed her to the florida state hospital for the mentally ill at 
chattahoochee her diagnosis was posttyphoid psychosis and 
she remained there until she was according to her records 110 
miss whites claim to longevity rests mainly on her medical 
records which are unusual since they span so much of her life the 
only possibility for fraud would be if she or her husband had lied 
about her age when she was committed a possibility certainly 
but one guinness considers unlikely 
there is no similar documentation for jackson pollocks life 
pollock a tall gangly man with a taste for prince albert tobacco 
and soul food says he was born christmas day 1866 served in the 
spanishamerican war and world war i and loaded mail and checked 
railroad baggage in cleveland and new york 
he has lived in the central state hospital in milledgeville 
since 1972 
alyce friend of the georgia office of aging has been preparing 
a report for guinness she has found tantalizing tidbits but no 
proof 
the strongest documentation is pollocks 1966 social security 
application which lists his birthdate dec 25 1869 which would 
make him three years younger than his hospital records but still 
the worlds oldest person 
but social security records can be based largely on the 
applicants word and are considered unreliable by longevity 
experts so for now pollocks claim is based almost solely on his 
own account 
ms friend for one believes him and calls him an 
inspiration she attributes his longevity to strong genes and 
selfsatisfaction 
guinness for now remains doubtful said editor donald mcfarlan 
the book lists shigechiyo izumi of japan as the person who lived 
to the oldest age ever documented 120 years 237 days based on 
census records 
but even that documentation isnt good enough for some 
scientists who say its just too unlikely that a human being could 
live that long 
i dont know a single serious gerontologist in the world who 
believes these claims of people who are over 115 said dr 
leonard hayflick professor of anatomy at the university of 
california at san francisco 
from time to time claims have surfaced of extraordinary groups 
of people who have lived well into their 130s 140s 150s and 
higher one such group was said to live in the caucasus mountains 
of the soviet union another in a remote area of ecuador in each 
case experts say the claims proved to be lies the motives vary 
but include draft dodging national pride tourism and simple 
boastfulness 
scientists say it again and again humans just arent built to 
last that long and they dismiss the notion that the human lifespan 
is getting longer 
life expectancy is another matter it has risen dramatically 
since the turn of the century as nutrition and medical care have 
improved but while more people are getting closer to the maximum 
possible lifespan the span itself is unchanged hayflick said 
as far as we know the human lifespan has not changed in the 
past 100000 years 
so were left with the claims of carrie white and jackson 
pollock and the thought that more people in the future will live 
long beyond the biblical span of threescore years and 10 which 
after all is only 70 
i think there will be a time when 100 years old will be very 
common said dr edward schneider dean of the andrus gerontology 
research center at the university of southern california i dont 
know about 110 but 100 will be common 
beyond that gerontologists say whats the point we all want 
eternal youth but do we really want eternal age the very old the 
experts say are rarely as interested in immortality as are younger 
people 
florence knapp of philadelphia lived to 114 and was for a time 
considered the worlds oldest person 
i think she could never understand why she was allowed to live 
so long her niece ruth oberholtzer said after her death one 
time she said that she feels like she might have been bad and this 
was gods way of punishing her

its hard to know what to expect when 
youre being ushered into a hospital ward to meet the oldest man in 
the world 
you fear hell be in worse shape than the other patients that 
youll be intruding 
nope 
jackson pollock who claims to be 123 is 6foot9 with cottony 
white hair hes a healthy man especially for someone whos 123 
he likes starched shirts hearty breakfasts and smoking a pipe 
detests the hospital where he lives and chats happily with people 
who stop by to see him 
he even has his jokes down pat 
how old are you mr pollock 
im 510 now he says 
the guinness book of world records lists carrie white of 
palatka fla as the oldest living person at 115 pollock 
insists hes eight years older 
alyce friend of the state office on aging has tried to 
document his history with limited success the search wasnt 
helped by some confusion over his name at some point after his 
arrival at central state his records somehow were changed to 
jackson pollard a mistake only recently realized 
pollock has no birth certificate not many blacks born in rural 
georgia two years after the civil war got one the social security 
administration lists his birthday as dec 25 1869 but pollock 
insists its really 1866 either would make him the oldest human 
but longevity experts say social security records can be based 
largely on a persons word and are considered unreliable 
pollock says he was one of the oldest of 13 siblings born on a 
farm near hawkinsville in central georgia at that time census 
records listed only a few black citizens there those working the 
farms of white landowners 
department of human resource staffers found several people who 
recalled a large black family named pollock near finlayson near 
where he says they lived and records show a james pollock 
presumably the father bought land in 1857 
ms friend believes pollock and has submitted everything she 
could find to guinness officials guinness for now remains 
doubtful 
pollock doesnt much care 
asked if he thinks his age is any big deal he just shakes his 
head after all he says his mother lived 107 years his father 99 
hes more opinionated about other things 
pollock likes the people who care for him but central state 
hospital is the worst place in the united states many other 
men in its long term care unit cant get around or are unstable 
and he keeps mostly to himself 
pollock was brought to central state against his will 17 years 
ago he was living near dublin in central georgia when some 
neighbors told the sheriff they didnt think he should live alone 
anymore its said he chased some people away with a shotgun 
fearing they were after his social security check 
hes only here because theres nowhere else for him to go 
said smithie thomas abrams a hospital spokesman pollock has no 
living relatives 
he never had children never had a wife i had a good time 
without being married i just stayed home with my people 
with his birthday just last month pollock has been visited by 
several news reporters its nice when people come down and meet 
you he said its good enjoyment 
pollock spent most of his working years on the railroads he was 
in the army during the spanishamerican war and again during world 
war i when he went to england and germany he was already retired 
when social security began but was grandfathered in its

large digital instruments are in and tiny buttons 
are out as aging drivers command more attention from automakers as 
they design and market cars for a swelling segment of the driving 
population 
the number of licensed drivers over 65 grew by 45 percent from 
143 million in september 1978 to 208 million in september 1988 
according to the most recent figures from the federal highway 
administration older drivers account for 127 percent of the total 
licensed drivers on the road 
thats a market segment automakers cant ignore 
i think it will be one of the greatest opportunities that 
theyve got said jim wangers president of automotive marketing 
consultants inc of vista calif 
reflecting the importance of the market chrysler corp decided 
to switch the bulk of its undisclosed advertising budget for 
chrysler cars to print from broadcast media in part to attract 
older buyers said jim jandasek manager of chryslerplymouth 
national advertising print with the media consumption patterns 
of the mature market is going to deliver more of those people 
about 70 percent of chrysler brand advertising is dedicated to 
print media dramatically more than other automakers a key reason 
for buying more print ads this year was because advertising the 
engineering features of 1990 model chryslers is more suited to 
print than broadcast jandasek said 
advertising for general motors corp and ford motor co are 
along more traditional broadcastoriented lines print ads for 
fullsize cars the most popular among senior citizens are 
targeted at media reaching those consumers 
advertising however is irrelevant if the product doesnt suit 
the buyer and that goes for any age 
automakers are carefully watching trends as the baby 
boomers born in the late 1940s and early 50s mature the look 
of american cars popular with older drivers is changing with them 
when ford introduced a redesigned lincoln town car in august 
traditional hard edges on the fenders the bumpers and the roof 
were gone 
chrysler will be smoothing out its cars targeted for senior 
citizens in a few years for now it is sticking with a proven 
winner with older drivers 
during the introduction of the 1990 imperial a squaredoff 
fullsize car chrysler executives said they were aiming the car at 
a loyal segment of the market that shuns rounder less 
traditionallooking cars 
that will change in the mid1990s when the company introduces 
cars made with smoother lines offered on some ford and gm cars of 
today 
the changes are inside too 
dave rees interior design director for ford said research is 
telling him what older people want if we think about the mature 
driver the primary area would be ergonomics the layout of 
controls the location of controls and the ease of operation he 
said 
they have very set tastes wangers said and i think they 
are going to be very difficult to get off of their traditional 
thinking 
many of those seniororiented features are obvious 
wideswinging doors a minimum number of buttons switches and 
knobs and familiar location of some controls especially headlight 
switches 
one recent development has caught on with senior citizens 
mature drivers tend to prefer the large easytoread electronic 
clusters rees said 
don massey owner of don massey cadillac inc in plymouth 
mich says he likes the big displays on the cadillac brougham 
im 61 years of age and for the first time in my life ive 
wondered why numbers on telephones arent larger massey said 
i think the psychological impact of the larger readout on the 
brougham is welcome to the older driver 
the brougham the longest of all cadillacs has a larger digital 
speedometer display than other models

for millions of visually impaired americans 
televisions are little more than oversized radios worse really 
because of hollywoods heavy reliance on visual images to propel 
plots 
im about as totally blind as you can get says dale lamar 
vice president of a support group for the blind in oklahoma most 
shows i can keep up with fairly well but when you get into an 
action show with lots of car chases and shootings you end up 
missing half the show 
but imagine a tv show where narrative is sprinkled between the 
dialogue describing the stealthy movements of a murderer the 
outcome of a chase thats the vision of jim stovall president of 
narrative television network 
i started losing my sight when i was 17 stovall said im 
31 now and totally blind about a year and a half ago i was 
watching an old bogart film and somebody shot somebody else and i 
was lost i thought with a little bit of narration this could 
work it just kind of exploded on us 
the networks programs have been shown at 11 am and 11 pm 
est every sunday since aug 20 they can be seen on the nostalgia 
channel available in about 7 million homes and on independent 
stations in 500 cable markets the narrated network uses 
nostalgias production facilities in dallas 
nostalgia network inc which sees its prime market as older 
viewers is a natural partner for ntn demographers say 60 percent 
of the 114 million visually impaired americans are older than 45 
we feel that narrative television has enhanced our value as a 
cable channel said joe schramm nostalgia marketing director 
the cable operator has a commitment to the community to provide a 
service and this certainly is a service 
there are few advertisers in part because nostalgia broadcasts 
movies uninterrupted we are just now approaching some national 
advertisers said stovall adapting commercials isnt as big a 
problem as people would think a lot of radio commericals are just 
television commercials without the picture 
he has won support from such hollywood legends as kirk douglas 
katharine hepburn and charlton heston and has been praised by 
cable magnate ted turner important since turner acquired the 
rights to the mgm library currently the network narrates public 
domain films or those to which nostalgia has acquired rights last 
month it broadcast frank capras its a wonderful life 
the way we narrate these programs stovall said is to try 
and determine what is important and present that to you as 
unobtrusively as possible without interjecting our opinion 
in the premier narrated episode of matlock featuring andy 
griffith as an atlanta lawyer a man stalks a young woman and stabs 
her to death the first dialogue though comes minutes into the 
plot after the stabbing and just before the womans boyfriend is 
arrested in her death 
the narration fills the void 
the silverhaired man pulls a long knife from its holder 
the narrator says his face is drenched with sweat as the 
young man showers the silverhaired man enters the bedroom holding 
the knife 
the young woman stirs awake sees him and begins to scream he 
puts his hand over her mouth he stabs her 
lamar who rented the episode on videotape said that until the 
narrated version the show was difficult to follow theres 
nothing but music for the first three minutes or so if it wouldnt 
have had the narration i wouldve missed the fact that dick van 
dyke was the killer 
while the network is a boon to the blind supporters point to 
another group sure to benefit schramm said its also for the 
visually impaired who have a spouse or family members or loved ones 
whose lives have been taxed or tied to the visually impaired 
because they had to interpret these shows 
the narrative television network is a spinoff of narrative 
video network a 1988 innovation that coupled narration with 
popular tv series on videotape 
we did matlock big valley andy griffith gomer pyle 
stovall said the response was so huge we couldnt get enough 
tapes out or do enough to keep everybody happy 
response to ntn is difficult to express he said the reaction 
has been very emotional if youve never seen television its 
very difficult for someone like yourself to understand to be able 
to sit and watch television is a very emotional experience for most 
people

as a child believing in magic i thought if i 
wrote down new years resolutions it was the same as doing them 
dont talk back to your grandmother brush your teeth practice 
the piano every day after school 
as adults the same belief in magic may hold true especially 
when it comes to resolutions involving health and fitness go on a 
strict diet get to a gym such promises often are made as we reach 
for a third chocolate mocha truffle or savor a second piece of aunt 
saras oyster loaf while watching the bowl games 
theres no doubt few of us get through the holidays without 
overdoing but there are other occasions for splurging birthdays 
bar mitzvahs anniversaries travel a favorite restaurant 
do we go on the teetertotter route of dieting then putting the 
weight back on or do we develop a new style of eating that 
maintains a healthy weight over a lifetime even when metabolism 
slows and it is easier to gain weight and harder to lose it a way 
of eating that allows for special times to splurge and makes every 
day the occasion for feasting lightly 
my solution is not to deprive ourselves of good food that never 
works it is simply to change portions and proportions 
choose twothirds of your food from the vegetable kingdom 
grains beans vegetables and fruits abounding in color variety 
vitamins and minerals and onethird from the animal kingdom 
meat fish fowl and dairy products with more calories from fat 
and cholesterol 
by becoming aware of this simple formula when we plan meals and 
shop the healthful balance is achieved without having to count 
calories a resolution that soon goes by the board 
following are three recipes that use this formula one you can 
easily adapt in your own cooking

its catalog time for gardeners the 
season to sit back and enjoy this years parade of matchless 
wonders and breeding triumphs 
i once needed only one catalog to fuel my dreams now ive 
gotten choosy leafing through a halfdozen before i decide which 
tomatoes beans and lettuce will grace my garden come summer 
theres a catalog for everyone some quite artistically 
illustrated and you learn where to look for special things the 
tomato growers supply co of fort myers fla for example offers 
170 tomato varieties plus 41 peppers 
for a foreign touch numerous catalogs will bring europe or the 
orient to your backyard among them thompson amp morgan of 
jackson nj the cooks garden of londonderry vt and 
shepherds garden seeds of felton calif 
not to be outdone such a venerable seed house as w atlee 
burpee amp co of warminster pa now has an international 
vegetable section in its catalog 
a catalog buff can unlock the gate to just about anything in a 
wideranging volume by barbara j barton of san francisco 
gardening by mail published by tusker press it lists more 
than 1200 nurseries and seed companies and more than 300 garden 
supply and service companies in the united states and canada 
indexed by plant product and location 
for some of us nothing equals nurturing our own tomato plants 
from tiny seeds to fruitladen glory but were becoming a 
diminished breed more and more are foregoing the seed catalogs and 
opting for readytogo plants 
much gets sacrificed in this choice variety of course 
suffers but the joy of gardening itself seems diminished to a 
purist growing from purchased plants is like painting from 
numbers putting a roll in the pianola or wearing snapon bow ties 
pure snobbery you might say with more than a little 
justification the nurseryacquired plant still needs tender loving 
care fertilizing weeding watering 
experts familiar with gardening trends see many causes behind 
the phenomenon nona koivula executive director of the national 
garden bureau in willowbrook ill which promotes gardening from 
seed says timesaving is a prime reason for picking up a 
flourishing flat at the nursery instead of a seed packet in 
tomatoes you save three months of work by buying plants ready to 
set in the ground 
also home vegetable gardens have shrunk dramatically in size a 
gallup poll for the national gardening association of burlington 
vt showed the typical plot nowadays reduced to 200 square feet 
from 595 square feet 10 years ago trimmeddown gardens just dont 
have room for multiple varieties 
and the number of vegetable gardens also declined from 33 
million to 31 million in the 1980s people found there were more 
bullish investments than a vegetable plot in the backyard the 
associations magazine said 
whether the garden is small or large tomatoes remain the 
overwhelmingly favorite crop followed by peppers onions 
cucumbers beans lettuce carrots corn radishes and cabbages 
the poll showed curiously broccoli a powerhouse nutritionally 
and easy to grow doesnt rank at all in backyard popularity 
every year catalogs abound in new and improved varieties each 
introduced with a drumroll of amiable hype breeders appear to be 
concentrating on disease resistance with more and more maladies 
conquered by stalwart new entries 
people who think flavor is bred out this way can find seedhouses 
that specialize in heirloom varieties or scan seedswapping 
sections of gardening magazines on the chance of discovering an 
oldtime favorite offered for trade 
now and then studying the catalogs produces a winner a couple 
years ago i found a broccoli called romanesco which takes a 
long time to mature but climaxes in a glorious chartreuse head 
cauliflower texture and great taste 
you wont see it in the supermarket and its not likely to show 
up at the nursery youve got to raise it from seed but its not 
really new a bit of research showed its an heirloom italian 
variety just now appearing in us catalogs

a greater share of elderly women will be 
divorcees in future years and they generally will have fewer 
financial resources than older women who are married or widowed 
researchers say 
older women living outside marriage especially those who are 
divorced experience much lower standards of living than married 
women teresa cooney peter uhlenberg and robert boyd of the 
university of north carolina reported in the january issue of the 
journal of gerontology social sciences divorcees are less likely 
to have owned their own homes have fewer assets to fall back on 
and may lose assets accumulated during years of marriage they said 
a historical study of divorce rates indicates that a much larger 
proportion of those reaching old age in the future will have been 
divorced they said 
one woman in eight will have her first marriage end in divorce 
after she reaches 40 with the probability of remarriage after 
divorce declining sharply with age the study said in 1985 for 
example fewer than 3 out of 100 divorced women aged 45 to 64 
remarried during the year 
if current rates persist only a minority of women who enter 
midlife divorced or who divorce after midlife will ever 
remarry uhlenberg cooney and boydwhile espousing free trade and open 
markets the president also 
promised to maintain a safety net to protect farmers from 
conditions beyond their control 
the president promised florida farmers they can count on the 
federal governments help in recovering from the terrible loss 
of their citrus and winter vegetable crop from last months freeze 
you wont be doing it alone he said 
bush said farmers have bounced back from trying times in the 
1980s with help from the 1985 farm legislation that led to lower 
federal crop subsidies and more land in production 
surpluses have declined dramatically and most of of good land 
has been brought back into production he said net farm income 
reached a record level last year the farm credit situation has 
greatly improved bringing more financial stability to rural 
america 
but bush added that marketoriented farm policies are only a 
part of the agricultural picture weve got to expand markets and 
enhance productivity weve got to assure the public that americas 
food is the safest in the world and weve got to protect our 
precious environment 
we must recognize that productive agriculture and a sound 
environment can be compatible especially in terms of water 
quality the president said 
the administration has already initiated a fiveyear effort to 
protect groundwater from contamination by fertilizers and 
pesticides running off farms he said 
we must keep your good land in business without unreasonable 
burdens but we must also keep it good land he said i am 
counting on your leadership as we work to expand farm productivity 
while safeguarding the environment 
without giving details bush said the administration also is 
drafting legislation to protect the food supply without 
overwhelming the agriculture industry 
he noted that farmers have a major stake in us efforts to 
foster free trade including its recent bold proposal in the 
uruguay round of international trade talks that would phase out 
exportsubsidies in five years and other tradedistorting practices 
in 10 years 
any agreement we sign will be an agreement thats also good 
for american agriculture he promised 
bush toured hightech agriculture and ocean exhibits at walt 
disneys epcot center nearby before his return to washington 
the trip was bushs first public appearance since expanamanian 
dictator manuel antonio noriega surrendered last wednesday to face 
trial in the united states on drugtrafficking charges 
it comes as us officials acknowledged they are having some 
difficulties arranging an increased role for the us military in 
the caribbean off the coast of colombia to help intercept drug 
smugglers sea and air routes 
bush asked sunday as he went jogging about reports that the 
aircraft carrier john f kennedy and other ships were steaming 
toward colombia said i will address myself to that question 
at a future date 
when a reporter suggested that colombian officials were upset 
bush said we dont know all that 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said discussions with 
colombian authorities have not begun and white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said today i think the problem is we havent 
had a chance here to really explore it with them 
however bogotas el tiempo published a communique sunday by the 
government of president virgilio barco that said the colombian 
government has not participated nor will it participate in any 
joint operation with united states military forces air or naval 
in the caribbean sea 
in international waters it has not participated nor will it 
and in territorial waters it has not authorized the operations 
nor is it considering authorizing them the statement added

ford motor co will give up on automatic seat 
belts by the mid1990s opting instead for air bags in all of its 
cars for drivers and frontseat passengers vice chairman harold 
poling says 
all of our tests have shown that when the passenger is 
properly positioned with the active belt plus the use of the air 
bag it provides the greatest protection in the event of an 
accident poling said sunday night at a news conference 
his comments came before he spoke to the opening session of an 
annual industry meeting sponsored by the trade weekly automotive 
news 
currently ford offers air bags on about half of its 2 million 
or so car fleet chrysler corp makes driverside air bags standard 
on all of its north americanmade cars and general motors corp 
has the devices as standard equipment on about 15 percent of its 
fleet 
by the 1993 model year federal regulations require automakers 
to have socalled passive restraint systems in place for drivers 
and frontseat passengers whether they are air bags with manual 
seat belts or automatic seat belts and no air bags 
the government required that cars made after sept 1 1989 be 
equipped with either a driverside air bag used in conjunction with 
manually operated seat belts for frontseat riders or automatic 
seat belts 
as the automakers were introducing their 1990 model cars they 
announced price increases of up to 5 percent over 1989 prices 
blaming most of the boosts on the safety devices 
direct comparisons of the cost of an air bag and an automatic 
seat belt system are difficult because of the wide variety of 
vehicle designs however air bags cost more to install and replace 
than do automatic seat belts 
poling said he didnt know how much it would cost to equip 
fords entire automobile fleet with driver and passengerside air 
bags by the mid1990s 
he estimated however it would add 400 to 600 to the cost of 
making each car about half of the cost of air bags now 
poling who on march 1 succeeds donald petersen as fords 
chairman also said that the company doesnt plan any major 
acquisitions in the near future during the second half of 1989 
ford spent nearly 6 billion to acquire the british luxury carmaker 
jaguar plc and the associates corp a financing company 
however poling said fords 25 percent stake in mazda the 
japanese automaker which which it jointly makes cars may grow 
if the opportunity occurred over time to increase our equity 
position with mazda poling said we would look at it 
favorably 
in his speech poling said the european auto market shows more 
potential for growth during the 1990s than does the north american 
market with projected increases of 15 percent and 1 percent 
respectively 
that combined with increased production capacity adds up to a 
rough decade for automakers 
the combination of excess capacity and slow growth in the 
automotive market will present a severe competitive challenge for 
car and truck manufacturers around the world he said 
however poling said automakers should have the chance to crack 
newly emerging markets including eastern europe and the soviet 
union

bank of new england corp reportedly is 
close to selling some of its operations in several states to 
fleetnorstar financial group inc the wall street journal 
reported today 
bruce p crooks a spokesman for fleetnorstar which reportedly 
has been negotiating with bank of new england declined to comment 
on the report when reached at home early today j terrence murray 
the banks chairman and chief executive could not be reached by 
telephone at home or at the office 
a bank of new england spokeswoman also declined to comment 
according to the journal which cited an individual familiar with 
the talks for its information 
fleetnorstar is seeking to buy bostonbased bank of new 
englands operations in maine and southern massachusetts and 
possibly connecticut the newspaper said negotiations continued 
last week with the final scope and terms uncertain it said 
although fleet has consumer loan offices in massachusetts and a 
branch in downtown boston that serves primarily as a commecial loan 
production office weve had interest for a number of years in 
massachusetts crooks said 
fleetnorstar has been stymied by the failure of the 
massachusetts legislature to pass a bill that would allow banks 
from outside of new england to expand in that state fleet because 
of a 1988 merger has extensive banking operations in new york 
state that technically make it a nonnew england bank under current 
massachusetts law 
fleet ran into a similar problem in connecticut but an order 
that it divest united bank has been put on hold while a legislative 
committee studies the entire issue of interstate banking said 
robert w lougee jr fleets director of corporate communications 
he also refused to comment on any possible deal with bank of new 
england or to discuss any timetable for conclusion of the talks 
bank of new england last month said it expected to post a large 
loss for the year with 16 billion in nonperforming assets 
mainly bad real estate loans both it and fleetnorstar have assets 
of about 31 billion but fleetnorstar has managed to avoid the 
regions severe real estate lending problems and its nationwide 
financial services operations have provided a more stable earnings 
base 
the journal said its source indicated several possible 
structures for the deal are being considered including one in 
which fleetnorstar would receive a stake in bank of new england in 
return for a capital infusion and another using securities whose 
value would depend on the future financial performance of the 
purchased operations

a campeau corp spokeswoman today denied a report 
that the company has abandoned its threemonth effort to sell its 
bloomingdales department store chain 
as far as we know this report is wholly unfounded campeau 
spokeswoman carol sanger said 
the canadian retail and real estate company which has said it 
might seek bankruptcy court protection for its us retailers has 
changed its mind about selling the chain because it has attracted 
only inadequate offers the financial times said in todays 
edition quoting unidentified financiers closely involved in 
campeaus restructuring 
campeau was believed to be seeking around 15 billion for 
bloomingdales a wellknown 17store chain torontobased campeau 
revealed in september that it was having financial problems and 
decided to put bloomingdales up for sale to raise cash 
but offers have come in too low partly because of the sluggish 
us retailing sector and a glut of department stores on the 
auction block the newspaper said 
a committee overseeing a restructuring of campeau apparently 
persuaded creditors that selling bloomingdales at a cheap price 
would only weaken campeaus balance sheet and reduce its cash flow 
the newspaper said 
campeau headed by flamboyant financier robert campeau burst 
onto the us retailing scene by buying federated department stores 
inc in 1988 for 66 billion bloomingdales parent company and 
allied stores corp two years earlier for 34 billion 
ms sanger the campeau spokeswoman said the second stage of 
the auction process is under way 
campeau has previously said that no more than five or six 
finalists would advance to the second round bidding for 
bloomingdales by the dec 8 deadline for initial offers campeau 
said it had received a number of expressions of interest a 
definitive announcement on the sale was expected sometime in 
february 
separately ms sanger confirmed that the campeau board of 
directors is meeting in toronto today she declined to comment on 
what might be discussed at the meeting and said she doesnt know of 
any announcements planned 
the wall street journal reported today that the board would be 
urged not to pay apparel manufacturers whose bills are due jan 10 
the newspaper quoting unidentified sources said campeaus 
banks and financial advisers oppose making the payments now because 
they believe its just a matter of time before campeau seeks 
protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
what theyre the campeau board members urged is not the 
issue what they do is the issue ms sanger said

parts of comecon are obsolete and need radical 
changes but the soviet union opposes disbanding the east bloc trade 
alliance as some nations have suggested a soviet spokesman said 
today 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov indicated what 
the soviet response would be to appeals by hungary czechoslovakia 
and poland for a major overhaul of comecon when it meets tuesday in 
sofia bulgaria 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov will lead the soviet 
delegation despite his mothers recent death gerasimov told 
reporters 
gerasimov blamed poor implementation of good past decisions for 
many of comecons woes 
there is no dynamism there is no sign of improvement in the 
trade structure there is no technological progress he said 
and so we believe there must be radical measures to restructure 
the mechanism of cooperation 
but he added as far as the direct answer to whether we need 
comecon or not yes we need it gerasimov said 
czechoslovak finance minister vaclav klaus said thursday there 
was no reason for comecon to exist polish foreign trade minister

tandem computers on monday announced a 
new computer that uses unix a standard operating system for 
controlling internal housekeeping functions of computers 
tandems action along with similar announcements expected 
monday from two other influential silicon valley companies signals 
a key trend in the computer industry toward the use of unix 
analysts said 
unix allows customers to avoid being locked into buying 
proprietary hardware and software available from just one vendor 
tandem the cupertinobased company known for reliable 
nonstop computers introduced its new integrity s2 system 
which will cost from 172000 to 248000 capable of performing 12 
million instructions per second it is based on the r2000 chip from 
mips computer systems and has three separate processors allowing 
it to keep running if one fails 
buyers have tended to balk at using unixbased systems for 
mainstream business purposes because they couldnt count on the 
systems being up and running said jeffrey beeler an analyst at 
dataquest it appears that tandem has done the best job of 
addressing reliability problems 
the other two companies are hewlettpackard co and intel corp 
in addition sunnyvalebased maspar computer corp planned to debut 
a new class of machine tuesday that approximates the power of a 
multimilliondollar supercomputer at a fraction of the price 
palo altobased hewlettpackard was expected to unveil two 
computer workstations that use a new version of a motorola 
microprocessor chip to perform 12 million instructions per second 
for a 50 percent increase for the hp product line the desktop 
model will start at 8995 
intel the santa clarabased company widely known for 
microprocessor chips is introducing new machines that can have 
from eight to 128 processors but they can get hefty speed boosts 
from the powerful i860 microprocessor from intels 80386 used in 
personal computers 
the systems range from 265000 to more than 1 million the 
largest configuration can perform 76 billion operations per second 
maspar one of the bestfunded computer startups in recent 
silicon valley history was scheduled to unveil its mp1 system a 
box 55 inches high and 23 inches wide attached to a digital 
microvax computer that can perform up to 15 billion calculations 
per second all for 170000 to 810000 
the intel and maspar machines link independent processing units 
together to address problems resulting in tremendous speed 
similar machines have been used to help design nuclear weapons 
and break codes and others are already used for financial analysis 
on wall street some observers expect them to become an important 
force in commercial computing 
the maspar and intel machines represent the new wave in 
computing said gary smaby an independent computer analyst in 
minneapolis

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a movie company that faces a 100000 fine in an antitrustrelated 
case 
the court without comment refused to free twentieth century 
fox film corp from the penalty for a contempt finding against one 
of the corporations regional managers 
the case has its origins in 1938 when the justice department 
accused twentieth century and seven other major movie companies of 
violating federal antitrust law 
the companies allegedly engaged in practices aimed at preventing 
small competitors from obtaining choice firstrun films 
one common practice the government said was block booking 
in which theater owners were forced to accept less popular movies 
if they wanted to receive more popular ones 
the government and the motion picture companies settled the suit 
in 1951 under a courtapproved consent agreement barring the 
companies from engaging in illegal practices 
but in 1988 leila goldstein twentieth centurys manager for 
indianapolis milwaukee and minneapolis was accused of violating 
the agreement 
she was charged for example with insisting that theater owners 
show the movie black widow if they wanted to run the more 
popular mannequin 
ms goldstein was fined 5000 for contempt and twentieth 
century was fined 500000 plus legal costs 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in august ruled that the 
movie company could be held in contempt for ms goldsteins 
behavior even though twentieth century had taken steps to make sure 
its employees complied with the 1951 court order 
it is this rule of vicarious liability that encourages 
companies to establish compliance programs the appeals court 
said 
but it ruled that the maximum fine that could be imposed against 
twentieth century without a jury trial is 100000 
the case is twentieth century fox vs us 89661

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the federal government may give special licensing 
preferences to television and radio stations owned by women and 
minority members 
the justices said they will use a florida case to review the 
federal communications commissions policy of treating such 
ownership as a favorable factor in its licensing decisions 
in a separate case from connecticut the court said it also will 
review the commissions policy of letting broadcast stations facing 
a license revocation sell the license at a reduced price to 
minorityowned firms 
the court also agreed today to decide whether governors may 
withhold state national guard units from peacetime training ordered 
by the federal government 
the court said it will hear an appeal by minnesota officials who 
opposed central american training missions for the states national 
guard troops the justices last april rejected a similar appeal by 
massachusetts officials 
in other action the court 
refused to force a revival of the fairness doctrine and 
require radio and television stations to present all sides of 
controversial issues 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the federal 
communications commission acted within its authority when 
discarding in 1987 the obligations it had imposed on broadcasters 
since 1949 
let stand a ruling that people have no constitutionally 
protected right to privacy when at home speaking on a cordless 
telephone 
the court without comment turned away arguments that law 
enforcement agents acted unlawfully when without obtaining a court 
warrant they monitored an iowa familys cordlesstelephone 
conversations 
rejected the appeal of a tennessee high school student pulled 
from a race for student council president after giving a speech 
officials deemed disrespectful 
the court without comment let stand rulings that officials at 
unicoi county high school in erwin tenn did not violate dean 
polings freespeech rights 
agreed to review a dispute over how much welfare aid some 
needy families are entitled to receive 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal aimed 
at limiting the payments in a virginia case at issue are features 
of the aid to families with dependent children program 
in conflicting rulings earlier this year different threejudge 
panels of the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the fccs 
licensing preferences policy but struck down the socalled distress 
sale program 
the fcc in 1986 began reviewing its policy of giving 
preferential consideration to firms owned by women and racial or 
ethnic minorities when awarding broadcast licenses 
but in late 1987 thenpresident ronald reagan signed an 
appropriations bill in which congress barred the commission from 
spending any money to continue its review of or make any change 
in its affirmative action policies 
the congressional action also insulated from commission review 
its policy adopted in 1978 of allowing bankrupt or otherwise 
troubled tv and radio stations to sell their licenses to firms 
owned by women or minorities 
such transfers if approved by the commission can be made 
without consideration of competing applications for the same 
license 
the policy of giving firms owned by women and minorities 
preference over competing applicants for broadcast licenses was 
challenged by metro broadcasting inc after its 1983 application 
for a license to operate a new orlando uhf television station was 
rejected 
the license instead was awarded to rainbow broadcasting co 
owned by two women and a man all hispanic 
an fcc review board said the minority and slight female 
ownership advantage enjoyed by rainbow outweighed factors in 
metros favor 
the commissions licensing decision was upheld by a 21 vote of 
a federal appeals court panel last april 21 
on march 31 a different threejudge panel of the same court 
voted 21 to strike down the distress sale program 
the appeals court ruled that alan shurberg and shurberg 
broadcasting were treated unfairly when the commission in 1984 
rejected his attempt to get a license for whcttv in hartford 
conn and instead allowed whcts owner faith center inc to make 
a distress sale to astroline communications company limited 
partnership 
the appeals court ruled that the commissions action violated 
shurbergs equalprotection rights citing recent supreme court 
rulings that trimmed the scope of affirmative action programs 
the distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored to remedy 
past discrimination because its effect is unrelated to the need for 
such a remedy the appeals court said it provides no 
procedures for ensuring that beneficiaries have actually 
suffered from the effects of past discrimination 
the appeals acted on today were filed by metro broadcasting in 
the florida case and astroline communications in the connecticut 
case 
bush administration lawyers acknowledged that the rulings in the 
two cases are based on conflicting rationales but urged the 
justices to leave both rulings intact 
they said the entire us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia should settle the intracircuit conflict 
after president bush fills three vacancies 
about the florida case the government lawyers told the justices 
that astroline communications is in bankruptcy proceedings and 
might well not be able to hold the license for channel 18 
regardless of whether the distress sale at issue were ultimately 
upheld 
they added that congress recently held hearings on the soundness 
of the fccs minority ownership policies and is set to review the 
fccs minorities policies by next october 
where congress is revisiting this complex and sensitive area 
of law intervention by this court at this time is not necessary 
the government lawyers said 
the cases are metro broadcasting vs fcc 89453 and astroline 
communications vs shurberg broadcasting 89700

financially troubled china and crystal maker 
waterford wedgwood group plc monday confirmed it is holding talks 
that might lead to a cash offer for a major but not controlling 
interest in the company 
waterford wedgwood shares gained 5 pence or 8 cents to 58 
pence on londons stock exchange on the news 
there has been widespread speculation for some time that 
waterford has been searching for a minority shareholder to give it 
a muchneeded cash infusion to help reduce some of the companys 
substantial debt 
the likely suitor is fitzwilton holdings plc a mediumsized 
cashrich irish industrial conglomerate said to be willing to take 
up to a 30percent holding in waterford wedgwood weekend press 
reports said 
a spokesman at fitzwilton who wasnt identified in accordance 
with british practice declined to comment 
however dublinbased sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that only fitzwiltons chairman tony oreilly and 
a group of highpowered investors have made an informal approach to 
the company oreilly also serves as chairman and chief executive 
of pittsburghbased hj heinz co 
regardless of who takes up the stake the sources said that 
about 120 million waterford wedgwood shares would be offered or 
30percent of the company at about 40 irish pence or 63 cents a 
share a deep discount from its current trading price of 62 irish 
pence in dublin 
waterford wedgwood has been suffering from serious financial 
problems in recent years an audit performed in late 1988 showed 
that accounting errors were made that significantly overvalued the 
companys inventories by up to 33 million waterford wedgwood 
chairman paddy hayes resigned after these revelations 
the company also has suffered from a decline in retail demand 
for its products in the united states and britain the appreciation 
of the irish pound against the dollar has hurt the companys 
fortunes 
last december the company warned that its would suffer a 
significant pretax loss in the second half

the supreme court today refused to force 
reinstatement of the fairness doctrine that required radio and 
television stations to present all sides of controversial issues 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the federal 
communications commission acted within its authority in 1987 when 
it discarded the doctrine it had imposed on broadcasters since 1949 
the fairness doctrine was based on the assumption that broadcast 
frequencies were less available than print media outlets such as 
newspapers which never have been subjected to such requirements 
for years radio and tv could be punished even denied license 
renewals for violating the doctrine which required that 
broadcast stations selling air time for the expression of one point 
of view on a controversial issue had to present contrasting views 
on that issue either by selling ads or making free time available 
to groups with opposing views 
the appeal acted on today stemmed from a fairnessdoctrine 
complaint filed by an antinuclear group against syracuse ny 
television station wtvh in 1984 
the fcc said the station aired a series of editorial 
advertisements that described construction of a nuclear generating 
plant as a sound investment for new york without adequately 
presenting contrasting viewpoints 
but the commission at that time had begun to question the 
permissibility of the fairness doctrine and in 1987 concluded that 
forcing broadcasters to be fair violates constitutionally protected 
freepress rights and contravenes the public interest 
the commission dismissed the complaint against the meredith 
corp owner of wtvh 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the commissions 
action last feb 10 without reaching the issue of the fairness 
doctrines constitutionality 
congress is considering legislation that would force the 
commission to revive the fairness doctrine by explicitly writing it 
into federal law 
similar legislation was vetoed in 1987 by thenpresident reagan 
president bush has said he too would veto such a measure 
the appeals court agreeing with the commission in this case 
ruled that nothing in the communications act of 1934 or its later 
amendments requires retention of the doctrine 
lawyers for the antinuclear group the syracuse peace council 
said the appeals court ruling if not reversed would subvert the 
longestablished public trustee concept for broadcasting 
they argued that a 1959 amendment to the communications act gave 
the fcc no choice but to enforce the fairness doctrine 
in that amendment congress specifically recognized that the 
public interest standard of the 1934 act embodies the bedrock 
fairness obligation the appeal contended 
bush administration lawyers urged the high court to reject the 
appeal they said the doctrine should not be enforced at a point 
when the commission determines that it has become 
counterproductive 
the case is syracuse peace council vs fcc 89312

several big banks lowered their prime lending 
rate a half percentage point today to 10 percent the first 
reduction in nearly half a year signaling cheaper loans for a 
broad range of consumers and businesses 
the move reflected the declining cost of money that banks have 
enjoyed in recent weeks the result of a more liberal credit policy 
by the federal reserve the nations central bank 
citibank and first national bank of chicago were the first to 
cut the key rate they were later followed by morgan guaranty trust 
co bankers trust co continental bank corp mellon bank and 
manufacturers hanover trust co 
the fed has been moving to ease interest rates recently in order 
to forestall a dramatic economic downturn lower rates encourage 
businesses and consumers to borrow money 
the prime rate is a benchmark that many banks use to calculate a 
range of other popularly known loan rates including variable rate 
home equity loans 
to joe and joan average consumer who have some of their loans 
tied to shortterm rates this is good news said f ward 
mccarthy an economist at stone amp mccarthy research associates inc 
many people have home equity loans or car loans tied to the prime 
and monthly payments should go down by next month 
the move today effective immediately marks the first time the 
rate has been changed since july 31 when banks lowered the prime 
to 105 percent from 11 percent 
most economists predicted other banks would follow suit by at 
least by tuesday saying todays move was long overdue there was 
little reaction in the stock or bond markets indicating that such 
a drop had been anticipated 
it comes as no surprise i think it was in keeping with 
current money market rates said william v sullivan an 
economist with dean witter reynolds inc 
sullivan said banks had the incentive to trim their prime just 
after christmas when the fed moved to lower the federal funds rate 
the interest on overnight loans between banks to the 825 percent 
level he said banks put off any cut in the prime because seasonal 
demands for higher cash reserves had pushed the fed fund rate above 
9 percent 
david h resler chief economist for nomura securities inc 
predicted that most banks will have lowered their prime by tuesday 
after executives have had a chance to meet on the subject 
however mccarthy said he wouldnt be surprised if some banks 
continued to put off any action or lowered their prime only a 
quarter of a percentage point 
mccarthy said the socalled yield spread which is the 
difference between banks borrowing costs and the rate at which 
they lend their money is not outlandish based on current 
economic conditions 
after todays prime cut it fell to 175 percentage points from 
225 percentage points based on current fed fund rates mccarthy 
said that when the economy is sluggish its not unusual to see the 
yield spread at around 2 percentage points 
when the economy is expanding banks can afford to keep their 
rates lower since loan volume is usually brisk mccarthy explained 
but as economic conditions weaken so do the need for loans and 
that means banks make up for a lower volume by keeping rates higher

a former vice president of a top wall street 
brokerage and 11 others were charged monday with using money from 
an earlier fraud to organize a 11 million tax evasion scheme in 
upstate new york 
mark stahl who was sentenced to five years in prison in 1987 
for mail fraud at shearson lehman brothers inc and the others 
were charged with setting up companies that conspired to evade 11 
million in state fuel taxes said nancy connell spokeswoman for 
attorney general robert abrams 
they were charged with enterprise corruption under an organized 
crime statute that carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail 
and fines 
the alleged scheme involved several companies set up to deliver 
fuel to the big apple and big m truck stops in the albany suburb of 
glenmont connell said 
the defendants allegedly bought home heating oil and had it sold 
as diesel fuel at the truck stops connell said through this 
process they avoided paying diesel fuel taxes which are much 
higher than home heating oil taxes she said 
they also were accused of hiding from authorities the amount of 
diesel fuel they brought into the truck stops evading still more 
taxes she said 
stahl was convicted of transferring more than 1 million in 
shearson funds to various bank accounts he controlled in 1986 and 
1987 he admitted in court however to a much larger scheme 
involving more than 18 million 
money from that fraud allegedly was used in the heating oil 
scam according to the indictment

jaguar plc said monday that two directors of ford 
motor co which acquired the british luxury car maker in nohouse then 
an art teacher said she had begun to detect 
a great deal of sexual and moral confusion in the minds of her 
students over what they had seen on tv 
her main target was the publicly financed bbc nearly a 
halfmillion people signed a petition in 1964 calling for closure 
of the bbc accusing it of broadcasting propaganda of disbelief 
doubt and dirt 
the bbc stayed on the air and barred mrs whitehouse from its 
programs for 15 years its directorgeneral at the time sir hugh 
greene said years later that her only contribution had been to 
raise the national level of intolerance 
critics still accuse her of trying to be the nations censor 
young people are not driven to excesses by explicit scenes of 
sex on the screen shes a very sincere lady but one of the most 
misguided said harry turner managing director of television 
south west an independent company 
mrs whitehouse insists her only demand is that broadcasters 
fulfill their responsibility not to offend against good taste and 
decency or incite crime 
it isnt that ones against sex or showing on tv that men and 
women love each other but its the kind of closeup voyeurism that 
people are sick and tired of she said 
her speeches draw capacity audiences and with influential 
figures such as mrs thatcher speaking out against overly explicit 
tv mrs whitehouse has come closer to representing mainstream 
british values 
in 1988 in what was widely seen as a backlash against 
permissiveness the government created the broadcasting standards 
council an agency to monitor sex and violence taste and 
decency 
mrs whitehouse claims to have secured legislation to ban child 
pornography control pornography in shop windows and on magazine 
covers and classify videotape rentals in december her 
association succeeded in getting the government to introduce 
legislation to bring broadcasting under the obscenity laws 
mrs whitehouses latest goal is to ensure that satellite tv 
recently launched in britain does not beam in sexually explict 
programs from abroad

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit by chattanooga tenn public utility officials against 
companies that made electrical equipment containing hazardous 
chemical pcbs 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the electric 
power board of chattanooga waited too long to sue 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals threw out the suit last 
july the appeals court said most of the equipment was purchased 10 
or more years before the suit was filed 
tennessee law requires such suits be filed within four years of 
the discovery of the alleged injury the appeals court said 
the power board sued for more than 10 million the estimated 
cost of replacing transformers and other equipment containing pcbs 
utility officials said the equipment manufacturers lied about or 
concealed the toxic effects of the chemical compounds 
but the 6th circuit court said power board officials were aware 
of the dangers of pcbs at least as early as 1976 they did not sue 
however until after federal environmental officials adopted new 
pcb regulations in 1985 
the utility officials had opposed the regulations because of the 
likely cost of complying the appeals court said 
when the regulation they had feared was passed in 1985 only 
then did they become outwardly concerned about the hazards of their 
uses of pcb equipment the appeals court said 
the appeals court also rejected arguments intended to let the 
power board use a federal environmental law as the basis for the 
suit the appeals court said deadlines for suing under the federal 
law were almost identical to tennessee law 
the companies sued by the power board were monsanto general 
electric mcgrawedison central moloney inc wagner electric 
westinghouse electric and sangamo electric 
the case is electric power board vs monsanto 89694

paramount pictures corp must pay art 
buchwald for the script idea the humor columnist claimed was the 
basis for the hit eddie murphy movie coming to america a judge 
tentatively ruled today 
the court concludes that coming to america was based upon a 
material element of or was inspired by buchwalds treatment 
judge harvey a schneider wrote in a 34page statement released 
this morning 
the decision becomes official in 10 days unless attorneys on 
either side raise issues not covered by it after that the ruling 
could be appealed 
in his ruling schneider did not specify how much buchwald 
should be paid but did say that the amount will not include 
punitive damages the los angeles county superior court judge also 
took pains to specify that murphy contributed considerably to the 
finished film 
the judge ordered a new phase of the breachofcontract trial to 
determine how much money paramount owes buchwald 
we dont agree with the judges decision paramount said in 
a statement the company said there would be an appeal murphy was 
at work on a movie on location in modesto and could not be reached 
for comment 
buchwald expressed joy at the ruling but quipped that he 
wouldnt write any more movie ideas for the next 10 years 
i am very very happy this thing is not only an important 
thing for me i think its really important for writers he told 
the associated press in a telephone interview from washington 
i didnt know what i was getting into when i started because 
those guys play rough and we beat them and that makes me very 
happy buchwald said 
pierce odonnell buchwalds attorney said buchwald and his 
partner producer alain bernheim could stand to collect 5 million 
to 10 million in their share of the films profits 
paramount maintains the film which has grossed in excess of 
300 million since its 1988 release has yet to show a profit 
in his opinion schneider ruled that the humorist did not base 
his idea entitled king for a day on a 1957 charlie chaplin 
movie entitled a king in new york 
the chaplin film which defense lawyers compared to buchwalds 
story is about an aging european kings adventures in the city 
after he flees his country while coming to america and 
buchwalds story concern the stateside adventures of a african 
prince or king 
the court concludes that coming to america is a movie that 
was based upon buchwalds treatment king for a day schneider 
said 
however he carefully specified in the ruling that he was not 
denigrating eddie murphys creative talent and stressed the term 
based upon since buchwald did not write a complete script 
he also said murphy was not to blame for the dispute with 
buchwald 
it is paramount and not murphy that obligated itself to 
compensate buchwald if any material elements of buchwalds 
treatment was utilized in or inspired a film produced by 
paramount the decision stated 
coming to america is no less the product of eddie murphys 
creativity because of the courts decision than it was before this 
decision was rendered he said 
in his decision schneider rejected the argument that paramount 
was guilty of bad faith and fraud and turned down a request by 
buchwalds attorney for separate punitive damages based on such 
action 
the court is unable to conclude that paramounts conduct was 
in bad faith let alone fraudulent oppressive or malicious 
schneider wrote 
in addition he rejected the suggestion that murphy stole 
buchwalds idea saying that the case did not revolve on such a 
claim 
the court desires to indicate what this case is and is not 
about the judge said it is not about whether art buchwald or 
eddie murphy is more creative it is clear to the court that each 
of these men is a creative genius in his own field and each is a 
uniquely american institution 
this case is also not about whether eddie murphy made 
substantial contributions to the film coming to america he 
added the court is convinced he did 
the judge said he also concluded that the case was not about 
whether murphy stole buchwalds concept king for a day 
rather this case is primarily a breachofcontract case 
between buchwald and paramount not murphy which must be decided 
by reference to the agreement between the parties and the rules of 
contract construction 
schneider noted that there was no question in his mind that 
murphy knew about buchwalds idea and that he discussed it on at 
least three occasions with at least one paramount executive 
he found that the buchwald idea and the murphy box office 
blockbuster coming to america were substantially similar and 
paramount remains liable for provisions of the contract which 
promised buchwald compensation if his idea became a movie

a mixed ruling from a federal appeals court 
over a landmark smokerdeath case drew a twopart chorus of victory 
monday from tobacco companies and a man who claims cigarettes 
killed his wife 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals on friday overturned the 
nations first money damages judgment against the tobacco industry 
removing the only blemish from their nearly 40 years of victory in 
such cases 
but the panel also sent back for trial a reshaped case that will 
likely put smoking itself in the dock reinstated claims against 
two other tobacco companies and perhaps deepened the well for 
potential damages 
despite the outcome the decision adds perhaps years more of 
legal wrangling in a 7yearold case 
for this case its the lawyers unemployment act said 
donald j cohn an attorney for cigarettemaker liggett group inc 
as lawyers on both sides study the opinion they are preparing 
for discussions with federal trial judge h lee sarokin on the next 
step 
quite frankly i think the opinion is terrific for the 
litigation generally said marc z edell the lead lawyer suing 
philip morris inc lorillard inc and liggett 
the companies made cigarettes smoked by lungcancer victim rose 
cipollone whose husband antonio carried on the case that blames 
the companies for his wifes death at 58 in 1984 
its unfortunate that we had to sacrifice the verdict to get 
that kind of opinion but for the big picture its extremely 
helpful said edell 
after a fourmonth trial the jury in june 1988 awarded 
cipollone 400000 philip morris and lorillard owned by loews 
corp were absolved but liggett was found liable for violating 
advertising promises to mrs cipollone 
a number of issues did not reach the jury because of rulings by 
sarokin several of those rulings damaging to the cigarette 
companies were reversed by the appeals court 
the panel found that edell should have been allowed to argue the 
riskutility theory which holds that if a products danger 
outweighs its usefulness the manufacturer can be held liable 
when that argument is introduced at retrial this will be the 
first time that a jury will actually make a determination as to 
whether or not cigarette smoking is something our society thinks 
should be around said edell philip morris and lorillard will 
also have to face this claim broadening the potential for damages 
edell said he would introduce evidence about the generally 
harmful effects on society such as statistics on mortality 
disease and the financial cost to businesses 
two factors though may prevent the cipollone case from 
breaking ground in riskutility 
on dec 28 a mississippi judge ruled in favor of such an 
argument the case is expected to go to trial in april and the new 
jersey supreme court is also considering the issue on an appeal in 
a state case brought by edell if he loses riskutility would be 
out of the case but the federal ruling would still help plaintiffs 
in other states 
cohn said the riskutility decision is not a boon to plaintiffs 
because the circuit court said a jury must also be convinced that 
the ordinary consumer wasnt aware of the dangers of smoking 
cohn said the opinion puts cigarette plaintiffs back at square 
one and that it will only help evaporate similar lawsuits which 
have dropped to below 60 from 150 in 1987 
litigation analyst calvert crary of labe simpson amp co 
downplayed actual numbers of cases 
antitobacco lawyers have adopted the strategy of you take 
200 cases throw em up against the wall and see which ones 
stick he said

iran is ready to accommodate 300000 
tourists and earn more than 210 million a year under the first 
stage of a tourism plan a government official said monday 
mahdi hashemi director of the tourism department of the 
mostazafan foundation said in tehran the number of tourists could 
be doubled later the official islamic republic news agency 
reported 
irna monitored in nicosia quoted hashemi as saying the first 
batch of foreign tourists will arrive from italy early in the 
spring negotiations are under way for other arrivals from moslem 
and third world countries he said 
a separate report by tehran radio also monitored in nicosia 
said plans have been completed for the exchange of tourists between 
iran and the soviet union 
the mostazafan or deprived foundation is a government welfare 
agency that operates its own tourist agency and other businesses to 
generate income for the poor 
hashemi said the foundations tourism subsidiary operates 32 
hotels in tehran and other cities that meet international standards 
after a decade of selfimposed isolation iran recently launched 
a drive to revive its once flourishing tourist industry to promote 
a better image to the world and to earn badly needed foreign 
currency 
iran catered for about 1 million tourists a year before the 
islamic revolution of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini overthrew the

the nations leading commercial banks on monday dropped their 
prime lending rates a half percentage point to 10 percent marking 
the first reduction in nearly half a year and paving the way for 
many cheaper business and consumer loans 
the move reflects the overall falling cost of money that banks 
have enjoyed in recent weeks due to more liberal credit policies by 
the federal reserve 
the central bank moved to ease interest rates late in 1989 to 
help forestall a dramatic economic downturn lower rates spur 
growth by encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow money 
the prime used as a benchmark for bank interest rates on a wide 
range of borrowing by consumers and small and mediumsize 
companies the groups likely to benefit most from a reduction are 
individuals who borrow against the equity in their homes and to a 
lesser extent those with car loans linked to the prime 
to joe and joan average consumer who have some of their loans 
tied to shortterm rates this is good news said f ward 
mccarthy an economist at stone amp mccarthy research associates inc 
monthly payments should go down by next month 
fixedrate mortgages arent expected to be affected by mondays 
prime cut because those rates are pegged to activities in the bond 
markets but rates have been declining for the past several months 
with average rates on a 30year conventional mortgage remaining 
below 10 percent since late october 
first national bank of chicago and citibank were the first major 
banks to cut the prime on monday the move was followed throughout 
the day by other large banks and many smaller institutions 
it was the first time the rate has been changed since july 31 
when banks lowered the prime to 105 percent from 11 percent the 
last time the prime stood at 10 percent was in november 1988 
before it was raised to 105 percent at the start of a yearlong 
upward trend 
many economists said mondays reduction was long overdue given 
how the fed had begun moving in early november to push interest 
rates lower 
stock prices closed higher while bonds and the dollar declined 
following mondays announcement 
william v sullivan an economist with dean witter reynolds 
inc said banks had the incentive to trim their prime just after 
christmas when the fed moved to lower the federal funds rate the 
interest on overnight loans between banks to 825 percent 
however sullivan said banks put off any cut in the prime 
because seasonal demands for higher cash reserves temporarily had 
pushed the fed funds rate above 9 percent 
the central bank can exert strong influences over fed funds by 
adding or draining reserves from the banking system through the 
sale and purchase of government securities 
many economists said the fed would have to be more persuasive in 
its push for easier credit before any future primerate cuts occur 
banks have been under pressure recently to maintain higher cash 
reserves in the face of problem real estate loans and loans to 
third world countries which also may have helped delay the latest 
rate reduction 
the socalled yield spread which is the difference between 
banks own borrowing costs and the price they charge for lending 
money is not outlandish based on current economic conditions 
said mccarthy 
after mondays prime cut the spread fell to between 175 and 
180 percentage points from 225 to 230 percentage points based 
on current fed fund rates and rates on threemonth certificates of 
deposit two key examples of banks borrowing costs 
mccarthy said that when the economy is sluggish its not unusual 
to see the yield spread at around 2 percentage points 
when the economy is expanding banks can afford to keep their 
rates lower because loan volume usually is brisk mccarthy said 
but as economic conditions weaken so does loan demand and banks 
make up for lower volume by keeping rates higher

the dollar fell sharply against key foreign 
currencies in active trading monday skidding to a 20month low 
against the strong west german mark amid continued concerns about 
declining us interest rates 
gold prices also slipped after a mixed performance overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 403 a troy ounce down 330 from friday 
republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid for gold at 
40180 an ounce off 445 
currency dealers said a cut in us commercial banks prime 
lending rate monday to 10 percent from 105 percent helped 
depress the dollar in foreign exchange the primerate cut reflects 
more liberal credit policies by the federal reserve since late 1989 
and lowers borrowing costs for a number of businesses and consumers 
lower interest rates are seen as bearish for the dollar since 
they make dollardenominated investments less attractive to 
foreigners 
at the same time interest rates have been holding steady 
overseas particularly in west germany where the crumbling of the 
berlin wall promises to spur economic growth dealers noted 
stong interest in the mark pushed the dollar to its lowest level 
against that currency since late april 1988 according to ronald h 
holzer a vice president at harris trust amp co in chicago 
the dollar fell to 16685 marks from 16895 marks late friday 
continued purchases of marks favors a lower dollar scenario 
holzer said german rates remain firm while the fed policy 
is stable to easy credit 
enthusiasm for the mark also was renewed by fridays 368 
percent devaluation of the italian lire against the other 
currencies in the ninemember european monetary system dealers

carl icahn who waged a proxy fight two years 
ago seeking control of texaco corp is considering a similar 
battle for usx corp a wall street source said monday 
icahn usxs largest shareholder was expected to decide within 
a few weeks whether to pursue a proxy fight in hopes of replacing 
the directors of the steel oil and gas giant said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
a usx spokesman william keslar said the company had no comment 
on any potential moves by icahn 
icahn who also is chairman of trans world airlines long has 
been dissatisfied with usx management and believes the companys 
stock price is too low 
the source said icahn believes usxs position is similar to that 
of texaco in 1988 when the takeover strategist failed to unseat 
that companys board in an attempt to force a restructuring that 
would boost texacos stock price 
icahn who has argued in favor of usx selling its marathon oil amp 
gas subsidiary wants shareholders not management to decide 
whether the division should be kept or sold the source said 
if he won a proxy fight essentially enlisting the support of 
enough shares to win an election over his proposals icahn could 
replace the usx board with directors more sympathetic to his stand 
on marathon 
the proceeds from a marathon sale conceivably would be 
distributed among shareholders or used to pay down usxs debt 
either move would enhance the price of the companys stock 
usx stock rose 62 cents to 3675 a share monday on the new 
york stock exchange 
usx already has decided to sell its texas oil amp gas co 
subsidiary usx chairman charles corry said recently the company 
would pare down its debt by about 1 billion debt with the proceeds 
however the company so far has been unwilling to sell marathon 
icahn won federal permission last month to acquire at least 25 
percent of usxs stock he currently owns nearly 34 million or 
1326 percent of usxs outstanding common shares 
icahn also reportedly has been considering a bid for the 
company he offered to buy usx for 72 billion in early 1987 but 
abandoned the proposal after it was rejected by the usx board 
a proxy fight at usx would mirror to some extent icahns fight 
with texaco 
when icahn became texacos biggest shareholder in late 1987 he 
immediately began fighting with management charging it was not 
doing enough to raise the companys stock price 
he proposed a takeover of texaco valued at 145 billion and 
then tried and failed to unseat the companys board in a proxy 
fight icahn said that if he won control of texaco the companys 
assets would be sold and the proceeds distributed to texaco 
shareholders 
in early 1989 after texaco undertook a major restructuring that 
included the sale of billions of dollars in assets and payment of a 
special dividend to stockholders icahn reached a standstill 
agreement with the company several months later he sold his stake 
for 207 billion and has since returned his attention to usx 
gregory drahuschak a steel industry analyst with butcher amp 
singer in pittsburgh predicted that usx ultimately would sell 
marathon but management wants to determine when its going to be 
done 
icahn would find some support among usx shareholders who have 
waited for the companys stock price to go up but it will not go 
down without a heck of a battle said drahuschak 
george zimmermann director of research at gruntal amp co said 
of icahn he has about a 5050 chance of winning a proxy fight 
because of a growing trend toward shareholder rights among us 
corporations 
zimmerman said a sale of marathon might help boost the price of 
usxs stock but he doubted it could go much higher than its 
current level he said usxs profits which were up more than 20 
percent through the first three quarters of 1989 were not 
expected to coninue at that level in 1990

the answering service forwarded calls about the offer to 
reynolds mothers house in houston where he discussed his business 
and personal history in a telephone call monday morning messages 
left in later followup calls to a brother and an answering machine 
at the house were not returned 
among the unanswered questions are 
why his news release said his weatherby investments inc is an 
overthecounter stock and why he said it was traded 
overthecounter on the pink sheet distributed by the national 
quotation bureau 
the national quotation bureau and the national association of 
securities dealers have no record of weatherby and it is not 
listed in guides to overthecounter stocks 
reynolds said monday weatherby had earlier been known as 
california pacific industries and he intended to change the name 
back but there was no listing under that name either 
why the address and suite to which investors are invited to 
send questions is a private maildrop box in beverly hills a 
yearandahalf after reynolds says he moved his operations from 
texas to california 
in the conversation early monday reynolds said his work was 
done from several offices including an unspecified location in 
century city but he gave no address and said he is still looking 
for a central location 
reynolds describes himself as an intensely private businessman 
who used to walk in his bankers side doors because he favored 
jeans and cutoffs he says he still feels more comfortable in a 
sweatsuit crunching numbers at a computer terminal than in a suit 
and tie 
ive always had a real hardcore attitude about other 
businesses and banks if theyre going to deal with me theyre 
going to have to know me and put up with me he said im not 
going to fit into their world 
bond the holding company whose australian brewing interests are 
in the hand of receivers says it will listen to offers from 
reynolds who says weatherby is a division of singaporebased 
california pacific international pte ltd 
reynolds says he is descended from a long line of oilmen in 
throckmorton texas and locals there say books have been written 
about the reynolds clan and its intermarriages with the even more 
famous matthews cattle and oil family 
reynolds said he took freshman english and biology classes at 
the university of texas and a few business classes at various 
colleges before succumbing to entrepreneurial urges 
he got started in business by importing gray market cars 
upgrading them to meet american standards and selling them at a 
profit he said 
actually i was living in austin and a few of my frat brothers 
got in with me reynolds said we had some cash flow and it 
looked pretty good and i said the hell with this college 
career 
as it stands now he says hes confident he can find refinancing 
for bonds 6 billion debt bond says it wants to see more details 
and skeptics in the international investment community say they 
have never heard of reynolds or his operations 
reynolds says he got a realestate brokers license in texas in 
1983 and got involved in development companies he also says he has 
dabbled in a claytile factory in france

energy futures tumbled monday led by a steep 
slide in prices of wholesale home heating oil and unleaded gasoline

profittaking anticipation of lower demand due to milder weather 
expectations of a buildup in crude oil stocks and internal market 
forces energy market analysts said

heating oil for february delivery plummeted 350 cents to 6433 
cents a gallon adding to the accumulated loss of 1037 cents 
suffered in the two previous trading sessions march heating oil

down 
jim fiedler a vice president at edampf man international 
futures inc said part of the selling was a sort of reflex action 
after the sharp runup in prices over recent weeks 
it probably was overbought and now it probably will be 
oversold he said 
traders sold to collect profits amassed during the prolonged 
rally in the energy futures pits he said with higher temperatures 
forecast there also is speculation that demand might not be as 
great as previously believed 
another incentive to sell came from estimates that industry 
figures due tuesday will show a large rise in crude oil 
inventories fiedler said problems that forced refineries to 
temporarily halt operations in the past week or so caused crude 
stocks to rise 
the american petroleum institute will issue its weekly report on 
production and stocks after the market closes on tuesday

ual corp shares fell monday after a deadline set 
by a major shareholder for the company to come up with a new 
employee buyout plan arrived without any apparent progress 
the stock fell 287 a share to 15662 on the new york stock 
exchange 
the investor group coniston partners said last month that it 
would press for a recapitalization of ual unless the united 
airlines parent presented a buyout plan preferably one involving 
employee stock ownership by monday 
no proposals were disclosed by late in the day coniston leaders 
and spokesmen for the ual pilots and machinists unions did not 
return telephone calls ual spokesman rob doughty said he couldnt 
comment on the buyout issue 
a spokeswomen for uniteds flight attendants union said she had 
no information indicating that any efforts were underway to come up 
with a plan 
we know of nothing going on right now with any buyout plan 
we know of no meetings and no dates for meetings said bobbie 
pilkington spokeswoman for uniteds chapter of the association of 
flight attendants she added that she believed the situation was 
quiet because no one is taking it the deadline very seriously 
ual last week said it was accelerating its schedule for talks 
with nonunion employees over a possible buyout plan although the 
companys schedule indicated it was likely to miss conistons 
deadline those talks are to begin wednesday 
ual management already has met with leaders of uniteds pilot 
and flight attendant unions over possible employee buyout of the 
company 
coniston which owns 118 percent of uals stock said dec 20 
that it was dissatisfied with progress being made toward sale or 
restructuring of the company that would boost its stock price 
it said that if coniston and the ual board couldnt agree on a 
recapitalization plan coniston might proceed with a plan to 
solicit shareholder consent to oust 13 of uals 15 directors and 
take majority control of the board 
a pilotmanagement plan to buy the company for 675 billion or 
300 a share failed last fall when banks refused to finance it 
after that the board reportedly was seeking employee support 
for a proposal that would value the company at 240 a share or 
5443 billion 
samuel buttrick who follows ual for kidder peabody amp co in 
washington dc said he viewed conistons buyout plan deadline 
mainly as an attempt to get ual to move more quickly 
ive regarded it all along as a soft deadline said 
buttrick clearly if any progress is being made it is at a very 
slow pace its a very difficult deal to bring together

ivan f boeskys main arbitrage fund has been 
liquidated and 248 million distributed to its limited partners to 
settle one of many claims against the former wall street 
speculator attorneys said monday 
in addition some lawsuits against the partnership cx partners 
lp have been settled and others placed on hold in manhattan 
federal court where more than two dozen classaction lawsuits 
against boesky and affiliated entities await resolution 
the agreement between cx partners and its 46 investors was 
reached after more than three years of discussions and litigation 
dating to boeskys november 1986 settlement of insider trading 
charges with the securities and exchange commission 
david r herwitz liquidating trustee for cx partners said the 
agreement was a major step in the resolution of disputes stemming 
from mr boeskys conduct 
still pending in the case that rocked wall street are completion 
of an sec plan to use 50 million paid by boesky to reimburse 
individual investors who can prove they were defrauded by his 
trading 
under the agreement liquidating cx partners formerly known as 
ivan f boesky amp co most of the limited partners received 100 
percent of their investment herwitz said 
the total equity investment in the fund which boesky formed in 
march 1986 to invest in stocks of potential takeover targets was 
338 million but boesky and his wife surrendered all their 
interests in the enterprise and some partners did not receive full 
compensation 
the limited partnerships included insurance companies financial 
institutions and individual investors some future disbursements to 
the partnerships are possible herwitz said 
other details of the agreement were not made public but sources 
familiar with the case said the boeskys interest in the fund 
totaled around 10 million 
guinness plc the largest holder in the fund with a 100 million 
stake received just 37 million of its claim said george 
reycraft a lawyer for the limited partners 
other large stakes in the fund reportedly included 28 million 
by jeffrey m picower of new york its largest investor 10 
million by lincoln national life insurance co 10 million by 
britains water authorities superannuation fund and 6 million by 
new york investor milton dresner 
mondays settlement included an agreement with drexel burnham 
lambert inc resolving a series of issues surrounding the limited 
partners investments drexel had an 8 million equity stake in the 
boesky fund and owned 20 million of its debt 
reycraft said drexel received the full 20 million for the debt 
but no interest or any of its equity investment under the 
agreement drexel will be dropped as a defendant in the 
boeskyrelated lawsuits he said 
but reycraft said the limited partners planned to proceed with 
litigation against boesky and others including former drexel 
financier michael milken and admitted securities felons dennis 
levine and martin siegel 
a delaware court last year ruled that drexel was entitled to get 
its money back before or at the same time as the partners drexel 
spokesman steven andreder declined to comment on the agreement 
saying it was confidential 
boesky 52 is due to be released in april from a brooklyn 
halfway house where he is completing a threeyear prison term 
boesky pleaded guilty to one count of violating federal securities 
laws and paid 100 million to settle charges he led a network of 
illegal trading using inside information 
the government is using 50 million of the money to compensate 
investors who can prove they were victimized by boeskys trading 
sec officials had set jan 15 target date to establish a plan to 
distibute the money 
we are working toward achieving a plan for distribution of the 
money but that may or may not have anything to do with an 
investors settlement said john h sturc an sec associate 
enforcement director 
mondays settlements could help speed resolution of a mountain 
of lawsuits including classaction shareholder cases and other 
litigation attorneys said some of the charges involving cx 
partners either have been settled or placed on hold according to 
lawyers involved in the case 
the lawsuits are consolidated before us district judge milton 
pollack 
some of these lawsuits will be reduced abated or limited 
herwitz said part of what is happening is people are going to 
try to save a dollar or two on litgation costs 
boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated with 
lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his alleged insider 
trading activities most of the lawsuits are by shareholders who 
were selling stock at the time boesky and his associates were 
buying

digital audio tape decks which offer the sound 
fidelity of compact discs along with the capability to record 
could be sold in the united states by the summer two leading 
japanese manufacturers say 
both matsushita electric industrial co which produces the 
panasonic and technics brands and sony corp say they hope to 
introduce the dat recorders in the us market sometime this year 
sony was vague on its plans but matsushita said at this weeks 
consumer electronics show that it will market a home recorder this 
summer at a price of about 1300 
the recorders longawaited by audio buffs have been on sale 
for several years overseas but their introduction to the us 
market had been held up by record companies who feared dats 
ability to make highquality tape recordings will encourage 
pirating and cut into their compact disc sales 
that issue was for the most part resolved last summer however 
when an agreement was reached on new technology that would allow 
direct copying onto a digital audio tape but would not allow 
unlimited copies to be made of those tapes 
manufacturers say they hope to capture a large segment of the 
highend audio market with the recorders despite their steep price 
tag in addition blank dat cassettes will cost 12 to 18 or more 
than twice the price of conventional blank cassettes the recording 
time of the dat tapes is similar to that of conventional cassettes 
i think it has the capability of being a very large market 
said john bermingham president of sonys us tape division 
compact discs and digital audio tape will exist together like lp 
albums and cassettes did before 
bermingham said sony envisions dat tapes which are about half 
the size of normal cassette tapes being used in its popular 
walkman stereos and in car stereos a consumer could record onto 
the tapes in his home tape deck and use them in the other 
applications he said 
you have some problems now with portable and car cds with 
taking them jogging or on a rough road bermingham said with 
dat you wouldnt have that problem 
both dats and cds use digital technology to reproduce music 
offering little distortion and high dynamic range in addition dat 
tapes lack the hiss that plagues conventional tape and many 
audiophiles believe it produces a deeper and more rich sound than 
compact discs 
but sales have been disappointing during the three years dat 
equipment has beem on the market in japan because of high prices 
and initial opposition from record industry groups 
under the july agreement which still must be codified by 
federal legislation new dat equipment will be able to make 
nearperfect direct digital recordings from digital sources such as 
cds but will add a flag signal to the tape to prevent any 
secondgeneration copies from being made from the tape 
while sony and matsushita were both displaying dat recorders at 
the electronics show general electric audio products announced at 
the show that it has developed what it calls the first compact disc 
player that allows recording and rerecording 
a spokesman for the company which is owned by thomson sa of 
france called the system the first major advancement in the 
format since cd technology was introduced but said it will not 
be available to consumers for at least a year 
the new system uses magneto optical discs for recording but is 
playback compatible with cds now on the market 
though ge claimed its recorder was the first sony said in 
october that it also had developed a magneto optical cd recorder 
thought it also was not yet ready for market
