hurricane hugo the caribbean killer blamed for 25 
deaths seethed past the bahamas tuesday on an uncertain path that 
threatens an area from florida to north carolina by friday 
disaster teams found death and destruction in puerto rico and a 
string of resort islands clobbered by the mightiest storm in a 
decade in the northeastern caribbean more than 50000 people were 
homeless and military planes ferried radios drinking water 
generators chainsaws and other equipment to stricken areas that 
pleaded for more help 
whole buildings just picked up and left said james grissim 
a resident of water island in st thomas he recalled sheet metal 
roofing flying through the air singing as it went and glass the 
sound of glass breaking all over the place 
forecasters used computers satellites and charts of old storms 
but could not predict hugos wobbly path it lurched to the north 
and west because other weather systems seemed to be blocking it from 
heading into the open atlantic 
at 1030 pm edt the hurricanes center was near latitude 238 
degrees north and longitude 695 west about 190 miles northeast of 
grand turk island a british island off the southern bahamas 
according to the national weather service 
hugo was moving northwesterly at about 12 miles per hour but its 
winds were down to 105 mph and forecasters expected some 
fluctuations in hugos strength overnight 
hurricane warnings were downgraded to storm warnings for the 
southern bahamas as hugo skirted past but the bahamian government 
issued warnings for the central islands of the archipelago 
islanders boarded up their homes as a precaution 
no one is relaxing their vigil because it can change 
direction said bill kalis press secretary for the governments 
information office 
in florida nasa officials said they would wait until wednesday 
before deciding to move the space shuttle atlantis scheduled for 
launch oct 12 from its launch pad and into shelter they also put 
off a decision on whether to remove a navy communications satellite 
from an atlascentaur rocket on another launch pad until more is 
known about hugos path 
i think hugo has certainly got people nervous said kathleen 
hale director of the dade county office of emergency management 
fred krounse spokesman at brevard countys emergency management 
office in rockledge fla said volunteers were getting 100 
telephone calls an hour 
cruise ships steamed out of the way while american airlines 
heavy caribbean service which uses san juan as its hub was 
suspended 
in san juan national guardsmen with automatic rifles patrolled 
streets to help police with rescue and to prevent looting police 
spokesman tony santiago said 40 businesses reported looting much of 
which occurred at the height of the storm police had arrested 30 
people on looting charge he said 
puerto rico gov rafael hernandez colon said he would ask the 
federal government to declare the island of 33 million a us 
commonwealth a disaster area and seek immediate relief aid 
looting by machetewielding mobs was also reported on the island 
of st thomas in the us virgin islands 
relief officials asked for cots and plastic sheetings to use for 
shelters for the thousands of islanders whose homes were crumpled by 
hugo the fourth hurricane of the season and the first to hit puerto 
rico since 1956 
coast guard vessels from puerto rico would scour the waters off 
the island because of reports there are a lot of people stranded 
on boats out in the water said coast guard lt stan douglas 
hugo walloped the northeastern part of the island then skirted 
its populous northern coast on monday it churned on to the 
northwest and toward open water it whirled past but missed the 
dominican republic 
at least 25 people in the caribbean died from the storm said 
cizanette rivera a spokeswoman for the civil defense in puerto rico 
two people died on puerto rico while trying to remove a tv 
antenna sunday in preparation for the storm according to maria 
dolores oronoz of the governors office she said no other deaths 
had been reported on the island 
however american red cross spokesman brian ruberry said in 
washington there were reports of 12 deaths and 100 injuries in 
puerto rico and that threefourths of the islands residents were 
without power 
hugos winds overturned cars peeled roofs off houses and office 
buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in san 
juan fifty airplanes were reported destroyed mangled into twisted 
wrecks at the isla verde airport 
in hawaii secretary of the interior manuel lujan said 500000 
in emergency assistance funds were released to aid stormstricken 
areas of the us virgin islands 
federal teams reached the us virgin islands to assess damages 
tuesday before deciding whether to recommend disaster relief 
sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet 
on shore in st thomas and some waterfront businesses have 
disappeared 
hugos itinerary included some of the most idyllic pearls in a 
750mile long necklace of caribbean isles beginning early sunday 
with the french resort of guadeloupe in the leeward islands five 
were killed 80 injured and more than 10000 lost their homes there 
also damaged were the lush british isle of montserrat antigua 
st kitts nevis anguilla the british virgin islands the us 
virgin islands of st croix and st thomas and puerto rico 
forecasters said it was the regions worst storm in terms of wind 
strength since hurricane david which killed 1200 people in the 
caribbean and florida in 1979 
last year hurricane gilbert walloped the western caribbean and 
took a southern route through the gulf of mexico killing more than 
300 people and causing billions of dollars of damage in nine nations 
meanwhile tropical storm iris was building up although 
forecasters said its strengthening would be slowed by hugos wake 
iris with 70 mph winds was about 275 miles northeast of the 
leeward islands on tuesday and was moving northwest at about 12 mph 
at 1030 pm iris was near latitude 213 north longitude 606 
west

grubs lurking underneath lawns have attracted 
raccoons and skunks and one resident has found a solution 
roy palmquist who said raccoons have torn up his yard set up 
three floodlights and plays a radio outside so far the grubbers 
have stayed away 
john fech an extension agenthorticulturist for the douglas 
county extension service said the white grubs damage grass but 
their predators rip up the lawns grubs are short fat wormlike 
larva of certain insects 
he said two to three people a day have called his office to 
report damage from the animals 
fech said that since both raccoons and skunks are nocturnal 
animals residents could discourage them by keeping their yards

asked how much money the 
soviet union has set aside for its space shuttle and other payloads 
for its new superbooster the rockets designer dug into his pocket 
and pulled out a handful of coins 
boris i gubanov a grayhaired man of 59 was joking in fact 
the government is spending 21 billion a year on the energia 
booster rocket and the shuttle buran it carries into orbit but 
beyond the mirth gubanov and other soviet space officials are under 
pressure to economize and are facing serious criticism not unlike 
that faced by the us national aeronautics and space administration 
and its shuttle program 
we have stubbornly continued spending money on this hopeless 
affair konstantin p feoktistov an engineer and former 
cosmonaut said of the soviet shuttle at a recent roundtable 
discussion in moscow 
when the gleaming white and black buran russian for 
snowstorm soared into orbit for the first time last fall 
president mikhail s gorbachev hailed it as one more confirmation 
of the kind of huge possibilities the soviet union has to solve any 
problem 
perhaps just as important burans pilotless remotecontrolled 
flight and return to earth proved that the soviets were still very 
much in the space race with the americans 
but feoktistov in remarks reported by the weekly moscow news 
said none of the technology developed for the shuttle has yet been 
applied to improve the lives of the soviet people and that launches 
of cargoes by the buran will be 20 to 40 times more expensive than 
by expendable rockets 
roald z sagdeyev a space scientist and member of the supreme 
soviet parliament said the soviet union developed a shuttle 
solely as a symmetrical reply to the us version even though 
officials knew it was not really needed 
he told the roundtable the program that resulted in a lookalike 
soviet version of the us shuttle was the last refuge of 
windowdressers 
the attacks fueled by chronic problems in the soviet economy 
were targeted at a space program that had long been a sacred cow 
the cosmos had been a source of national euphoria and pride ever 
since the soviet union ushered in the space age in 1957 with the 
launch of sputnik the first manmade object put into orbit 
the mounting criticism has already forced cuts and delays in the 
soviet shuttle program which began in 1976 and culminated in the 
first and only flight of the buran in november space officials 
spoke initially of launching the shuttle again in 1990 building a 
fleet of five or six and launching 10 by 1997 
now they say the next flight wont take place until 1991 that 
only three shuttles will be built and that only five missions will 
be conducted through 1995 
the whalesized energia the worlds most powerful rocket booster 
that flew a test mission in 1987 and propelled buran into orbit has 
also suffered cutbacks 
gubanov its chief designer told reporters who recently visited 
the baikonur cosmodrome 1560 miles southeast of moscow that five or 
six of the rockets could be produced annually but that he only has 
enough money for one a year 
gubanov and other project officials are countering the criticism 
with a public relations campaign to put the best face on the 
cutbacks and point out the programs benefits 
the energia designer told a moscow news conference in august the 
project had come up with 600 innovations that can be applied in the 
economy and that within the next 10 years the value of such 
spinoffs could reach 20 billion rubles 32 billion 
other officials defended the long waits for the next shuttle 
flights a 1991 unmanned mission to dock with the orbiting space 
station mir and the first piloted flight in 1992 
we dont plan to launch several times a year like the 
americans yuri p semenov the chief soviet spacecraft designer 
told a recent news conference in leninsk the city near baikonur 
where space center workers live they do this for business out of 
necessity we dont have such a need 
the veteran cosmonaut alexei a leonov who flew aboard a soyuz 
capsule that linked up with the us apollo spacecraft in 1975 has 
said people shouldnt be surprised that soviet officials are moving 
ahead cautiously with the shuttle 
we must have comfortable deadlines which dont force us to 
rush said leonov who now works in the star city cosmonaut 
training center near moscow 
at baikonur there are few signs that work on energia and the 
shuttles has slowed new launch pads assembly buildings and a 
runway have become part of the landscape and gubanov said 10000 
workers are involved in the project at the sprawling spaceport alone 
in the hangar where energia is assembled one rocket booster is 
being prepared for a test flight next year without the shuttle but 
with a payload still to be determined 
the buran meanwhile sits in a huge hangar where it is being 
analyzed following its flight the doors to the shuttles payload 
bay are open and specialists are removing some of the 40000 
delicate and expensive heatshielding tiles to inspect the skin 
underneath a second shuttle is being assembled in another section 
of the hangar 
soviet officials have said the shuttles tasks will include 
transporting repairmen to space to repair satellites and for 
rescuing crews stranded aboard space stations 
but the supreme soviet could put the shuttle under renewed 
scrutiny and gubanov said he is worried even further cuts might come

arthur bud brown was 79 when he died 
but florence brown remembers her husband as a younger man not the 
man who lay in the casket but the one in the videotape playing on a 
tv screen behind it 
there he was flanked by three friends as he sat proudly in the 
29 chevy roadster he used to court his wife cut to a 1952 photo 
the browns at a party thrown by merchants on garland avenue in one 
from the mid1970s brown is at the wheel of the motor home that 
took the couple on scenic vacations 
the sixminute video played at browns funeral july 28 
interspersed family snapshots with stills of majestic northwest 
sunsets lakes and mountains all to the tune of just a closer 
walk with thee his favorite gospel song 
we thought it was wonderful said mrs brown so many of 
the people that were there that i have seen and talked to since 
couldnt just get over the beauty of the whole thing i had several 
say that it was so beautiful that they almost clapped for approval 
they just thought it added a lot to the funeral 
the tribute video is the brainchild of merrill womach 
founder and president of national music service a spokane company 
that has been providing recorded music and sound systems to funeral 
homes and mausoleums since 1958 
i first thought about it when john f kennedy was assassinated 
i looked at all the things that were done for him and rightfully 
so womach said 
and i thought to myself why cant a tribute be paid to us 
normal peons rather than just reserved for heads of state do not 
our families love us as much as jfk was loved i think everbody 
whos lived deserves a memorialization or a tribute paid to their 
life no matter whether they were a president or a king or a brick 
layer or a garbage collector 
the idea got sidetracked until womachs mother died 3 years ago 
he remembered seeing her in a nursing home in her last three months 
haggard and weakened from several strokes every time he thought of 
his mother it was this somber scene then last year he gathered 
some old family album pictures of her cheerful spirited and 
smiling the pictures were reproduced onto videotape 
now when i think of my mother you know what comes to my mind 
instantly its that picture on the video 
several thousand tribute videos have been sold in 17 states 
most through funeral homes since they were introduced in april the 
videos which can be played on a standard vhs recorder cost an 
average 100125 the music comes from national musics 2500title 
library and is recorded with the companys proprietary process 
acquaintances of actress amanda blake miss kitty in the tv 
series gunsmoke bought a tribute video that was played on 
a huge tv monitor at her aug 24 memorial service in sacramento 
calif 
what were trying to do is to celebrate the life of the 
individual we resurrect a memory said womach who almost died in 
a thanksgiving 1961 plane crash and has had a tribute produced 
of himself 
partly because of the soaring demand for its videos national 
music plans to double its staff of 100 next year 
its a very meaningful way to express a persons life and how 
he lived it said larry rayburn a funeral director at riplinger 
funeral home where tribute tapes have been played at about 15 
funerals including browns 
i personally think funeral services are something people do not 
like to go to rayburn said this is a way to notice that a 
death has occurred but also to celebrate a persons life 
in warren mich the family of a 5yearold girl killed in a car 
accident ordered a tribute video after her funeral don 
temrowski director of ds temrowski funeral home said the death 
was especially traumatic because the girl died in her stepfathers 
arms and her body was grossly disfigured 
after viewing the videotape the girls mother remarked my 
baby will live on continually temrowski said 
cathy robertson of sandpoint idaho who works in a funeral home 
ordered a video of her parents who died within three months of each 
other 
it has been five years since they passed away and its almost 
like having them back for those few minutes she wrote to womach 
i have watched my 11yearold daughter watch it over and over 
what a beautiful and lasting remembrance to pass on to the 
grandchildren especially the younger one when the memories are 
starting to fade yes we have picture albums but there is something 
very different about the video

vietnams 11year war in cambodia 
began with a tankled assault in the season of joy 
early christmas day 1978 columns of tanks charged down route 14 
from ban me thuot in the central highlands to start vietnams 
invasion of cambodia and war with its former communist comrade the 
khmer rouge 
shielded by massive artillery and air barrages a dozen divisions 
surged west across the border including route 7 and route 1 leading 
to phnom penh one after another strategic points fell on the east 
bank of the mekong river kratie stung treng neak luong 
on jan 6 the vietnamese crossed to the west bank at neak luong 
and the next day marched into phnom penh so unexpectedly swift was 
the strike that the khmer rouge rulers left behind halfeaten meals 
and tons of arms as they fled 
on jan 10 a new communist government was proclaimed led by a 
former regional leader commander heng samrin and other khmer rouge 
defectors who had fled to vietnam from the regimes bloody purges 
all major towns were in vietnamese hands within a few weeks a 
sweep in april left the khmer rouge in tatters and scattered along 
the mountains and malarial jungles of the thai border to the west 
but sanctuary from thailand and arms from china soon raised the 
khmer rouge up from its knees into a potent guerrilla insurgency 
the third indochina war which was to split almost all asia into 
two hostile camps was just beginning 
north vietnam helped build the khmer rouge in the 1950s and armed 
its insurgency against the usbacked lon nol government in 197075 
but its quarrel over territory race and ideology flared in the 
open with skirmishes in disputed areas just after the khmer rouge 
seized power from lon nol in april 1975 
the khmer rouge regime killed 1 million cambodians in torture 
chambers and slave labor camps as it attempted to fashion a pure 
agrarian society 
the fanatics began raiding and shelling undisputed vietnamese 
territory in april 1977 burning down hundreds of villages and 
beheading and mutilating men women and children vietnamese 
officials said the border conflict in 197778 killed 30000 
vietnamese 
vietnamese forces made a major incursion in october 1977 and the 
fighting continued up to the fullscale war 14 months later they 
set up secret camps in vietnam to train an army of khmer rouge 
defectors 
phan hien then a key vietnamese negotiator held talks on the 
border clashes with khmer rouge leader pol pot 
nothing came out of it they didnt want to negotiate said 
phan hien now minister of justice in a recent interview in hanoi 
the khmer rouge planned to try to seize tay ninh province and 
perhaps even the southern commercial center of ho chi minh city 
said gen tran cong man editor of the official vietnamese army 
newspaper quan doi nhan dan 
no one in the leadership had reservations about invading because 
vietnam had no other choice man said although we knew the world 
would not respond favorably 
we wanted to withdraw as soon as possible but they the 
khmer rouge got support from china and thailand said vietnams 
current ambassador to phnom penh ngo dien 
china went further on feb 17 1979 the peoples liberation 
army sent human waves across the frontier for a 16day strike to 
punish vietnam for invading cambodia tens of thousands died in 
the fighting that laid waste to vast areas of northern vietnam 
vietnam obtained arms from the soviet union with whom it signed 
a 25year treaty the month before the invasion most noncommunist 
asian and western nations joined china and thailand in at least 
diplomatic backing for the guerrillas 
in june 1982 the guerrilla backers helped form a coalition 
joining the khmer rouge with the noncommunist forces of former 
cambodian monarch prince norodom sihanouk and former prime minister 
son sann 
each year the struggle for cambodia alternated between 
intensified dry season fighting and diplomacy in the fall at the 
united nations where the coalition was overwhelmingly supported as 
cambodias government in the general assembly 
vietnamese forces broke the cycle with a fivemonth offensive in 
198485 that overran all major guerrilla bases inside the cambodia 
border they drove the guerrillas and the 300000 civilians they 
controlled into thailand fighting then subsided into mostly limited 
guerrilla ambushes and psychological warfare in the villages 
vietnam once declared the situation in cambodia irreversible 
but diplomacy increased after a communist party congress in late 
1986 gave top priority to economic reconstruction 
in 1987 sihanouk held his first talks with phnom penhs prime 
minister hun sen vietnam first negotiated with the guerrillas in 
1988 
nineteen nations conferred for a month in august in paris but 
they all failed to settle the quarrel over whether the khmer rouge 
should participate in cambodias political future 
vietnam claims it began annual partial troop pullouts in 1982 
the departure of what it calls the last 26000 opens a new phase of 
the war

housing secretary jack kemp was jeered 
during a visit to a soup kitchen tuesday before he gave a speech 
pledging to speed up government aid to the homeless 
kemp offered few specifics during an impassioned talk to a group 
of federal officials and portrayed the fight against homelessness as 
part of a wider battle against poverty and despair 
there are people in this country who are hurting those that 
have been blessed have an obligation to be a blessing to someone 
else kemp said 
discussing the federal governments contribution to ending 
homelessness the secretary of the department of housing and urban 
development said is it enough no are we going to do more yes 
meanwhile in an interview with the new york times kemp proposed 
ways to rid the troubled agency of influencepeddling he said he 
would seek to base the awarding of hud subsidies on merit rather 
than on the discretion of department officials and to require that 
consultants register their fees 
im not chairman of the republican national committee kemp 
said funding decisions will be based on objective criteria 
competition merit and need not who you know or what your party 
is he said 
under kemps predecessor samuel pierce hud officials steered 
housing subsidies to developers who had hired politically connected 
republican consultants 
kemp said he would propose a mix of administrative regulatory 
and legislative measures as well as making all financing decisions 
public 
in hartford many of those eating at the st elizabeths house 
soup kitchen where kemp stopped before his speech doubted kemps 
words would result in action 
johnson nixon ford carter reagan bush its always the 
same thing its just another name and we never get anything said 
a homeless woman who jeered the secretary during his visit to the 
dining room crowded with about 100 people 
the woman who asked not to be named said she was angered that 
kemp chose the soup kitchen as a backdrop for a photo opportunity 
i dont feel that they should come in here with their jackets 
and ties on to have their pictures taken with homeless men women 
and children nobody asked our permission its humiliating 
degrading and total exploitation she said 
kemp was surrounded by reporters and photographers in the doorway 
of the soup kitchen and never made it inside the room 
kemps visit to hartford began with a tour of a homeless shelter 
that was empty for the day and ended with a pep talk to the 
interagency council on the homeless where he announced a 
rentsubsidy grant program 
president bush wants an allout effort to wage war on 
homelessness and despair on drugs and poverty and i plan to be a 
leader in that fight kemp said 
kemps speech gave an outline for what he termed the first 
steps in the effort to end homelessness the secretary called for 
improved coordination among federal state and local officials and 
nonprofit organizations aiding the homeless 
he also said the government would cut through red tape and make 
it easier for homeless people and those who provide for them to 
receive government help 
kemp announced a joint venture between hud and a philanthropic 
group the robert wood johnson foundation to create as many as 
1200 housing units in eight cities hud will provide rent subsidies 
worth about 36 million over five years and 24 million in 
foundation grants will be used for support services 
kemp conceded that government procedures have resulted in a poor 
record for helping the homeless he said that since 1983 only 293 
homes have been leased and 183 sold to organizations helping the 
homeless 
kemp said hud has 49200 houses available at a 10 percent 
discount for purchase by nonprofit organizations that can pay cash 
at closing in the past he said eligibility for such sales were 
limited to taxsupported entitities shutting out charitable groups 
that had no funding from the government 
such groups now will be able to receive the same benefits he 
said 
kemp said help provided by his department will be part of a 
broader antipoverty strategy with the department of health and 
human services 
we will pool our resources and our ingenuity he said in his 
prepared remarks if it requires waivers well grant waivers if 
it requires new legislation well propose it and if our efforts 
require new money ill ask for it the hud secretary said

the switch by one of the nations most 
successful classical music stations to rock n roll today 
underscores fears that high finance is silencing high class on the 
nations radio waves 
four months after being sold for 55 million 58yearold kfac is 
casting off beethoven brahms and bizet for the beat of contemporary 
pop music leaving the nations no 2 radio market with no fulltime 
commercial classical station 
its a great tragedy said robert goldfarb kfacs departing 
vice president for programming and operations 
from its debut in 1931 kfacam and later fm was distinguished 
as a citadel for the symphonic arts 
but that legacy was to end at 1 pm today and classical radio 
outlets elsewhere are hearing the same tune 
melodious orchestral maneuvers arent soothing the number 
crunchers who have become increasingly influential in the radio 
business now that stations regularly trade hands for tens of 
millions of dollars 
can any fringe format not just classical survive these 
kinds of selling prices asked bob caulfield president and 
general manager of milwaukee classical station wfmr 
kfacs new owners evergreen media of irving texas hope the 
programming change will yield an audience five times larger than 
kfacs although kfac enjoyed a loyal following and generated 
profits of up to 3 million a year it never attracted more than a 
fraction of local listeners 
economics have dictated that this change is necessary to 
make said kfacs new general manager jim de castro 
since theres limited space on the dial an established station 
with a powerful signal offers a new owner the prospect of sizable 
capital appreciation and healthy tax writeoffs 
no matter how wellmanaged a typical classical station will 
rarely attract more than 2 or 3 percent of listeners a hot rock 
station can grab more than three times that 
while most classical stations are unlikely to change formats 
soon commercial classical broadcasters are having to tune in to the 
realities of this marketplace 
i dont think anyone in the commercial radio business in the 
classical music field hasnt realized that we have to play by the 
same rules that all of our competitors are playing by weve got to 
generate attractive bottom lines said caulfield 
that may mean reinventing the classical format 
the perception is that classical radio is dull and boring 
and you have to have majored in it in college before you can turn 
the radio on said matthew field senior vice president and 
general manager of new york citys wncn and a lot of stations do 
nothing to turn that idea around this is no longer a time for ivory 
tower thinking 
although it has attracted critics wncn has sought to enliven its 
classical format with a morning drivetime team comedy skits a 
classical hitoriented playlist european vacation giveaways and 
guest disc jockeys like actor john cleese and phantom of the 
opera star michael crawford 
field said the station bought by gaf for 22 million in 1976 
is profitable and should make about 2 million this year 
contests and promotions aside it could be that many peoples 
interest in classical music stops at thirdgrade piano lessons 
its true that classical stations cant make enough money 
to be worth the value of the asset why is that its because there 
arent enough people who like classical music said goldfarb 
radio stations would be happy to program classical music if enough 
people wanted to listen to it 
in california with 686 commercial and public stations there are 
only 27 classical stations down from 29 in 1988 in new york state 
of 431 stations 18 are classical down from 19 a year ago and only 
three more than bigband 
rather than a large audience what classical stations offer 
advertisers are sophisticated upscale listeners 
the retailers and the merchants realize that we deliver less 
waste audience said john ver standig president of ver standig 
broadcasting owner of wgms in washington we deliver almost 
exclusively a demographic that both by age and by income is the 
prime buyer for any merchant that is selling anything of value 
despite the audiences quality it still isnt big enough for 
some 
many stations are now bought and sold more as speculative moves 
than bona fide intents to operate and own a broadcast service 
said mike langner past president of the concert music broadcasters 
association 
the speculators are driving out the broadcasters

even as a boy paul rokich sensed his future 
was tied to the barren hills behind smelter camp the mining town 
where he was born 
the hills were black as tar and just as dead decades of logging 
grazing wildfires and sooty smelter fumes had whittled a 
onceverdant forest down to a couple of old snags atop a ridge 
when i was 6 i saw those two dead trees rokich recalled 
and i knew i was going to go up and plant those mountains 
fifty years later paul rokich has done just that the 
longabused northern end of the oquirrhs a range of hills south of 
the great salt lake has come alive with grasses flowers shrubs 
and trees 
its a marvelous transformation but it would never have started 
had rokich listened to the experts as a young botany student at the 
university of utah he told professors of his dream to revive the 
oquirrhs rhymes with smokers they told him the eroded hills were 
beyond hope 
on may 7 1959 rokich set out to prove them wrong in the dead 
of night he parked his car hoisted a pack and hiked into the 
hills he was trespassing on land owned by kennecott copper corp 
sulfurous mist from the smelter hung in the air it was so 
quiet and still you couldnt believe it he said there was no 
vegetation no animals nothing 
that first trip rokich planted a russian olive tree and two 
plots of tall wheat grass over the years he planted anything he 
thought might grow in the desert pavement of the oquirrhs to 
finance his obsession for that is what it became he borrowed 
money from relatives begged donations from seed companies and dug 
into his modest earnings as a construction worker 
once one of his three boys was sick and the family was down to 
10 rokich spent 5 on medicine 5 on trees we didnt have 
extra money to spend on what he was doing said his wife ann 
but he had a vision 
he also had the strength of a mule at 6foot1 and 200 pounds 
rokich still hikes fast enough to leave a visitor half his age 
gasping in the early days he would start at 4 am hiking and 
planting for 15 hours to leave room for seedlings he packed 
neither food nor water he chewed elderberries found along the way 
spit out the seeds and planted them 
he had many setbacks young trees succumbed to drought early 
frosts rock slides and hungry rabbits one year a sheep herder 
burned off a hillside killing 3000 new douglas firs and ponderosa 
pines 
but slowly grass took hold elderberry and sumac shrubs became 
thickets and trees reached skyward 
after years of looking the other way kennecott in 1973 sent 
officials to inspect rokichs work they hired him rokich no longer 
had to smuggle in seedlings he drove a company truck planted trees 
by tractor and spread grass seed by the ton from a helicopter 
today in the canyon where rokich started fir trees are coming 
in like hair on a dogs back he said even kesler canyon the 
area closest to the smelter and the most devastated is being 
reclaimed 
it was supposed to be impossible to grow things here in 
kesler rokich said during a recent visit but look 
tenfoothigh locust trees poked up from a sea of grass 
sunflowers waved in the breeze a mule deer peered from a thicket 
i bet you there are 50 deer out there right now lying in the 
bushes and watching us rokich said there are also rabbits 
partridge bobcats and coyotes golden eagles and yellowtailed 
hawks soar and in autumn the oncesilent canyon echoes with the 
bugling of 200 elk 
kennecott modernized its smelter in 1977 reducing pollution and 
giving vegetation a chance to grow but company officials hand 
rokich most of the credit for the oquirrhs revival 
sure the company would have done revegetation work said 
frank fisher external affairs director but it wouldnt be 
anywhere as far along without a guy like paul hes truly a zealot 
rokich figures he has personally planted 60000 trees and shrubs 
on 14000 acres that first russian olive tree is now 25 feet high 
last winter an old bull elk looking for a place to die found 
shelter under its spreading limbs 
the years have turned rokichs hair white but at 56 he is no 
fading bull his youthful optimism remains evidenced by a perpetual 
grin and earnest brown eyes always scanning the next ridge for some 
happy surprise the mountains have kept him young he says and his 
work has kept him satisfied 
sometimes he sits in his truck and reads the hillside like others 
read a newspaper each precious plant has a history and paul rokich 
knows the details for its his history too 
you know i thought that if i got this started then when i was 
dead and gone people would come and see it i never thought id get 
to see it myself 
he stretched his arms wide as if trying to embrace everything 
the trees the birds the swaying grass 
im amazed he said look at what ive done what more 
could you want

police in birmingham held a tortoise lineup and 
claimed later to have solved the case of speedy the wanderer 
i am quite certain we have found the right owner said police 
superintendent martin burton whose force in the english midlands 
plucked the runaway reptile from thundering traffic on a highway on 
monday 
paul dunn 13 given time off school to attend tuesdays lineup 
picked out speedy as the pet that had been missing for two weeks 
i knew that if it was speedy i could prove it because he has a 
dent in his shell and if i breathe heavily into his face he will 
breathe back said paul 
burton said highway patrol sergeant brian wevill spotted the 
slowmoving tortoise walking on the m6 highway on birminghams 
outskirts 
one truck driver had halted to avoid running over the animal and 
other vehicles were forced to filter around the tiny traveler 
burton said 
when a radio newscast reported the rescue the police said they 
were flooded with calls from across britain claiming ownership of 
the tortoise 
one woman called from australia to offer a home 
owner and pet were reunited after police organized a lineup at 
the birmingham nature center zoo where burton had an infrared 
marking put on speedys shell to make sure it wouldnt get lost in 
the crowd 
we called him speedy when we found him and its just an amazing 
coincidence that he really is called speedy the superintendent 
said 
speedy loves greener pastures explained pauls mother 
eileen he has gone missing three times before and we have found 
him walking down the road but this is the first time he has 
ventured on to the motorway he has walked just over a mile in two 
weeks so it is pretty good going 
the number of claimants to speedy was not surprising 
tortoises are difficult to buy in britain because of import 
restrictions imposed following warnings from conservationists that 
the creatures are fast diminishing in their native greece and north 
africa 
speedy will be going into winter hibernation soon and needs 
plenty of nourishing meals to build up energy reserves 
mrs dunn gave the wanderer a bowl of bread and strawberry jam 
soaked in milk 
its his favorite she said

vietnam is predicting that 
factional fighting will continue in cambodia after its army 
withdraws from the neighboring country it invaded nearly 11 years 
ago 
the last vietnamese soldier is supposed to leave cambodia within 
a week 
maj gen nguyen van thai chief spokesman for the ministry of 
national defense made the tacit acknowledgment tuesday that vietnam 
had failed in its goal to wipe out cambodian resistance 
he also claimed that vietnams major achievement during the war 
was not strategic but involved saving the cambodian people from 
genocide at the hands of the khmer rouge 
the officer spoke at a news conference to announce the start of 
the last stage of vietnams withdrawal begun in july 1988 
the movement will mark the end of one phase of conflict and the 
beginning of another in indochina which has not seen peace since 
before world war ii 
between thursday and tuesday 26000 vietnamese soldiers are 
supposed to return to vietnam leaving behind a cambodian government 
army of an estimated 50000 regulars and 60000 to 80000 poorly 
trained militia 
facing them will be a resistance coalition of roughly 45000 men 
recent reports from the thai border indicate the fighting has 
heated up especially around the gemrich area of pailin and in siem 
reap province thai corroborated the reports and claimed resistance 
forces recently had received a massive shipment of weapons 
there might be trouble and fighting might continue without an 
end in cambodia thai said 
the first in a series of farewell parades orchestrated by the 
cambodian government is to kick off in siem reap thursday morning 
more than 500 journalists from all over the world will be in 
cambodia to witness the troop movement an action vietnam hopes will 
better its international reputation the country one of the poorest 
in the world is badly in need of western aid which was mostly cut 
off after it invaded cambodia 
thai denied allegations by cambodian resistance factions that the 
withdrawal was a sham and vietnamese soldiers were being disguised 
among the ranks of the cambodian army 
absolutely there will not be any vietnamese troops remaining 
in cambodia after sept 26 thai said 
he said he was confident that cambodia would be able to defend 
itself against the resistance coalition led politically by the 
former cambodian king prince norodom sihanouk and militarily by 
the radical communist khmer rouge 
however he did not rule out a vietnamese military return to 
cambodia 
in case of a threat of the genocidal regime coming back then i 
think the government of the state of cambodia would call on the 
international community for help he said 
if called on for assistance thai said the vietnamese army 
would then announce its decision 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ending the bloody 
fouryear rule of the khmer rouge and installing a provietnamese 
government in its place during its rule the khmer rouge killed 
hundreds of thousands of people in trying to turn the country into 
an agrarian commune 
since it was installed in cambodias capital phnom penh the 
provietnamese government has gained some legitimacy in the eyes of 
cambodians buddhist monks are no longer harshly persecuted and the 
economy has improved slightly 
since 1979 vietnamese and cambodian government forces have 
battled against a guerrilla coalition comprised of troops loyal to 
sihanouk the khmer rouge and son sann a former premier of cambodia 
china which fought a brief border war with vietnam in 1979 is 
the main military backer of the resistance coalition which also 
receives humanitarian support from the united states and the 
capitalist countries of southeast asia the soviet union is the main 
military backer of vietnam 
a series of internationally sponsored negotiations have failed to 
arrive at a political solution to the conflict 
recent talks in paris collapsed because of a disagreement over 
the future role of the khmer rouge in the cambodian government 
when asked what he thought vietnams 10year occupation of 
cambodia had accomplished thai said it had saved the cambodian 
people from genocide in terms of strategic aims thai said vietnam 
had succeeded in defending itself 
thai said vietnam lost 55300 troops during its fight with 
cambodia 25000 of whom died during border clashes with cambodia in 
197778 another 55000 troops were seriously wounded

subway gunman bernhard goetz was released from 
jail early wednesday after serving more than eight months in the 
shooting of four youths on a subway train in 1984 
goetz left the brooklyn center of detention through a side door 
to avoid about 30 photographers reporters and eight camera crews 
who were waiting for him by the front entrance 
he refused to come out the front door said deputy chief of 
operations pete mahn 
before the release correction department spokeswoman ruby ryles 
said a privilege that goetz and other inmates have upon being 
discharged is to be driven to the nearest subway station mahn did 
not say if goetz was taken to the subway 
ryles said goetz who became something of a folk hero among those 
who saw him as a lone individual taking a stand against crime 
whiled away much of his time playing chess with fellow inmates in 
his 18cell protective custody block 
others in the block included convicted child killer joel 
steinberg jewish militant mordechai levy and bensonhurst race 
attack suspect joseph fama 
goetz 41 had been a selfemployed electronics technician before 
he was arrested in the shooting on dec 22 1984 of four teenagers 
he said were trying to rob him on a subway near the world trade 
center when they asked him for 5 
the youths claimed they wanted the money to play video game 
machines 
in june 1987 following a twomonth trial goetz was cleared of 
attempted murder and assault but convicted of illegal possession of 
the gun he used to shoot the youths 
state supreme court justice stephen crane sentenced him to six 
months in jail a 5000 fine 250 hours of community service and 
ordered him to undergo psychiatric treatment 
goetz and his lawyers appealed the sentence calling it illegal 
the prosecutor assistant district attorney gregory waples and the 
state supreme courts appellate division agreed 
the appeals court sent the case back to crane for resentencing 
in january crane sentenced goetz to one year with time off for 
good behavior he was expected to serve eight months in jail and 
would have been released two weeks ago but jail guards found a 
plastic safety razor in his cell and he was ordered to serve 14 days 
more as punishment 
goetz said jail officials had given him a dirty razor and he was 
afriad of getting aids ryles said inmates are given fresh unused 
razors every day she said he refused to surrender the razor to 
guards claiming he was keeping it as evidence and he drew the 
extra two weeks in jail 
goetz still faces a multimilliondollar lawsuit filed by the 
family of one of his victims darrell cabey who was left 
braindamaged and paralyzed 
goetz who lives in manhattan has said he might leave new york 
city after he gets out of jail

barred from the united states for 22 years 
prosciutto from parma makes a comeback this fall italians 
demonstrated to the department of agriculture that the aircured 
raw ham is not hazardous to your health 
parma had long exported its famous parmesan cheese along with 
the opera music of its native giuseppe verdi and its conductor 
arturo toscanini but its light pink tender sweettasting 
prosciutti were kept out in 1967 when swine fever swept italy 
fearing footandmouth disease and hog cholera the us 
government closed its borders americans had to make do with swiss 
ham from tessin or imitations from pennsylvania or connecticut 
but claims giorgio orlandini no one could ever match the 
curing by sweet and foggy air drifting through pine olive and 
chestnut forests and the tradition of pork pummelers massaging hog 
shoulders into tenderness for at least a year before they reach the 
store 
orlandini director of the industrial union of parma helped lead 
the battle to get prosciutto back to the united states 
only pigs bred in a special area on a combination of parmesan 
curds and other feed but not slop can be candidates for 
prosciutto they must reach 330 pounds at the end of a year before 
going to registered slaughterhouses 
after hardening for 24 hours in deep freeze hog shoulders are 
pared of fat salted seasoned and frozen for another month 
the hams emerge to the kneading bench for the first of many 
massages to squeeze out the salty juice and tenderize the meat 
they are kept at least 400 days in ventilated storage halls that 
contain slats opened from time to time at night to allow the 
balsamic air to waft through the hanging hams 
finally the hams are scrubbed with warm water sandpapered to an 
attractive finish and kept in a moist chamber until selling time 
at almost every stage the ham massager gives them another quick 
rubdown inadequate hams are eliminated with the 214 members of the 
prosciutto ham corsortium able to take a tax deduction 
the parma ham symbol a ducal crown with five points burnt 
into the prosciutto and a specially stamped metal joint guarantee it 
is the real thing 
parma produces over 8 million prosciutti a year about half of 
italys total raw ham production 
processors say the long seasoning destroys all potentially 
present microorganisms and should trim the ham to nearly half its 
original weight but no less than 154 pounds 
stung by the us ban the consortium fought to prove that swine 
flu had been licked and that the slaughtering seasoning and 
pummeling were as hygienic as in america 
a veterinarian from the us department of agricultures animal 
and plant health inspection service was sent to visit the 21 
companies accredited for export to the united states changes were 
made but fivecenturyold traditions remained such as ceremonial 
hambyham smelling 
an expert still inserts a thin bone from a horses tibia to 
discern if the aroma in the processing is just right 
finally the innocence of prosciutto has emerged says franco 
scatozza dean emeritus of veterinarian medicine at the university 
of parma 
it would be absurd to suspect that if the animals suffered an 
infection these organisms would survive a long period of processing 
and seasoning and these illnesses would not be contagious for 
humans 
scatozza said the us government finally was persuaded after 
governmentsupervised experiments on both sides of the atlantic 
that the long curing of the ham triggers selfsterilization and 
eliminates any viruses 
on april 8 1987 the news spread through this gastronomic 
capital of italy the us department of agriculture had lifted the 
ban 
after clearance procedures the goahead was flashed for 
shipments to america this month 
the thin silky slices of ham retail in italy for about 15 a 
pound the price should hover around 20 a pound in the united 
states selling under such labels as il numero uno 
macys was reported ready to sell it for 1495 a pound 
about 40000 hams are scheduled for export to the united states 
before yearend two million prosciutti are exported yearly mainly 
to other european countries 
prosciutto agent thomas phiebig of englewood cliffs nj says 
prosciutto will be found initially at east coast specialty shops 
after an oct 1 gala dinner to welcome back the italian ham at new 
yorks hotel pierre with gov mario cuomo in attendance

residents say theyll 
welcome the us and soviet foreign ministers this week as long as 
the teteatete in the grand tetons doesnt crimp elk hunting or 
trout fishing 
bob lunger owner of spike camp sport shop was too busy 
outfitting dozens of hunters for the juststarted elk season to 
worry about the presummit meeting between secretary of state james 
baker and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
this is my busiest time of year lunger said i dont have 
time to pay much attention to that stuff 
lungers attitude isnt much different from that of many jackson 
hole locals who are about as impressed with visiting dignitaries 
and celebrities as backcountry bull moose or black bears that wander 
into the town of jackson 
there are a lot of celebrities that come through here we just 
dont make a big deal about it we just go on about our business 
said amy jones floor manager for the get your buns in here bunnery 
in downtown jackson 
president bush has been a frequent visitor to the area known for 
its blue ribbon fly fishing art galleries wooden sidewalks skiing 
and towering 13766foot grand teton 
former presidents kennedy ford carter and teddy roosevelt all 
vacationed in the area which also has been home to movie stars 
artists and wealthy industrialists 
actor harrison ford of star wars fame often is spotted at 
local cafes and the rockefellers and duponts have ranches in the 
area 
while the presence of celebrities may be passe in this 
cosmopolitan mountain town the bakery manager conceded this 
presummit itself is a little more exciting than bo derek making a 
movie 
the superpower talks and accommodations will be at the 385room 
jackson lake lodge in grand teton national park about 30 miles 
north of jackson and just south of yellowstone national park in 
northwestern wyoming 
earlier this year baker who owns a ranch about 75 miles south of 
jackson enticed shevardnadze to agree to the meetings in wyoming 
after showing him photographs of the tetons 
from the lakeside lodge the delegations will be able to gaze 
through 60foot tall windows at the snowdusted mountains a short 
walk will take them through stands of golden aspen and if theyre 
lucky give them a view of a moose or two wading across willow flats 
or into oxbow bend of the snake river 
while the two delegations discuss arms control human rights 
international law the middle east and the global environment an 
estimated 400 journalists from throughout the world will crowd 
jacksons motels restaurants and bars 
the press will have little access to the lodge prompting tourism 
officials to try to take advantage of possible idle time for members 
of the media they have compiled hundreds of feature story ideas 
about the area 
the setting itself cant help but provide a humbling environment 
for the global powers to meet said gov mike sullivan who plans to 
greet baker and shevardnadze upon their arrival thursday night 
anybody thats been there knows theres a special aura about 
the beauty of the tetons and the peaceful nature of the valley 
sullivan said you can get very close to nature in jackson 
thats always helpful to any kind of deliberations 
but can they get close to the western flavor of the area settled 
by fur trappers and mountain men in the early part of the 19th 
century and now populated by the wealthy ranchers 
environmentalists shopkeepers and ski bums 
i dont think you can be in jackson hole without experiencing 
the flavor of the west sullivan said even if ensconced in 
meetings theyll feel the mountain air and see the clear rivers and 
oversee the beautiful mountains if we dont get a cold front that 
moves in

two experimental vaccines protected lab animals 
against a lethal dose of the bacteria that cause legionnaires 
disease raising hopes for a vaccine to protect humans a researcher 
says 
between 600 and 1000 cases of legionnaires disease are reported 
to the federal centers for disease control each year estimates of 
the actual number of cases range as high as 100000 a year said the 
vaccines developer dr marcus horwitz of the university of 
california los angeles 
its clearly a major problem in hospitals horwitz said 
tuesday at a meeting of the american society for microbiology 
its a major cause of death from hospitalacquired pneumonia 
the first vaccine horwitz developed consisted of a weakened 
mutant strain of the bacteria legionella pneumophila which causes 
the deadly disease 
then horwitz developed a vaccine consisting of a single chemical 
from the virus the singlemolecule vaccine protected 21 of 26 
guinea pigs from a lethal dose of legionella bacteria 
none of 26 unvaccinated guinea pigs survived after the same dose 
horwitz said 
guinea pigs were used because they develop a disease similar to 
legionnaires disease in humans he said 
dr robert breiman a legionnaires disease expert at the cdc 
said the vaccine if it ultimately proves successful in humans 
could be especially useful for the transplant recipients cancer 
patients the elderly and people taking steroids 
they all have weakened immune systems and are especially 
susceptible to legionnaires disease he said 
horwitz and his colleagues have very nice results breiman 
said the vaccines look like they protect animals very nicely 
against legionella 
it remains to be seen whether this sort of vaccine would 
protect these people who are especially at risk said breiman who 
worked with horwitz before going to the cdc its a long way to a 
vaccine in humans 
horwitz said it would be at least two or three years before he 
was ready for a trial of the vaccine in humans 
he said he was surprised that you can immunize an animal with a 
single molecule such a vaccine should be safer easier to use and 
cheaper than the mutant bacteria vaccine 
the molecule is called the major secretory protein and its 
function in legionella infection is not understood horwitz said 
he does have a good theory of how the vaccine works however 
legionella bacteria infect certain white blood cells called 
monocytes and then hide inside where the bodys immune system cant 
find them 
the immune system primed by the vaccine secretes substances 
that change the monocytes in such a way that they lose most of their 
ability to absorb iron as they normally do 
legionella bacteria depend on iron and when they dont get it 
they stop growing 
the next step in the research will be to show that the vaccine 
can protect animals against various strains of legionella 
pneumophila and against other species of legionella 
legionella pneumophila is responsible for 90 percent of 
legionnaires disease but five or six other species of legionella 
also cause disease horwitz said 
another question to be answered is how long the immunity induced 
by the vaccine will continue to protect against disease he said 
legionnaires disease takes its name from its first known 
outbreak at the pennsylvania american legion convention in 
philadelphia in july 1976

an estimated 500 americans came home from cancun 
mexico last year with a severe form of dysentery that sent some of 
them to the hospital for a month according to a us government 
study 
the disease was caused by a strain of bacteria almost identical 
to one that infected 500000 people in central america between 1969 
and 1972 killing 20000 said dr julie parsonnet of stanford 
university 
this is one of the most infectious organisms there is and one 
with a very high hospitalization rate she said tuesday at a 
meeting of the american society for microbiology where she 
presented the results of an investigation of the 1988 cancun 
epidemic 
the occurrence of the epidemic raises concern that the disease 
which tends to peak every 25 years or so may be on the rise again 
in mexico and central america she said 
she said that americans should not cancel trips to cancun a 
popular resort because of the epidemic the risk of getting this 
illness is extremely small she said 
tourists who do visit cancun should take the precautions 
recommended for all visitors to mexico she said dont drink water 
or beverages with ice and avoid uncooked foods 
parsonnet who until recently was at the federal centers for 
disease control in atlanta said she and her colleagues identified 
51 americans with infections of shigella dysenteriae in 1988 
fortyfour had been to mexico and 33 had been in or near cancun 
three of the 51 had lifethreatening complications and one 
9yearold girl almost died parsonnet said 
the symptoms include bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps that 
women have described as being similar to labor pains 
the exact source of the infection in cancun could not be 
identified she said 
cases of the disease are still being reported to us officials 
an increase is expected as reports from the summer begin to come in 
because the disease tends to peak in the summer she said

new us efforts to stem the flow of soviets 
most of them jews into this country may leave evangelical 
christians at the end of the line to face severe repression at home 
an evangelical group says 
the national association of evangelicals through its world 
relief arm is campaigning to prevent the oct 1 implementation of 
an administration plan that would cut off the christians main 
escape route through vienna and rome 
this administration must not impede the escape of persecuted 
individuals for the sake of bureaucratic convenience said a 
letter from world relief to congress we fear for their safety in 
a nation where political stability is at best precarious and where 
persecution of this group remains unabated 
rep bruce morrison who chairs the house subcommittee on 
immigration said he planned to take up the evangelicals plight in 
a meeting today with attorney general dick thornburgh and other 
administration officials 
evangelical christians most of them pentecostals have been 
seeking to leave the soviet union since the 1960s it was only last 
year with the opening of the soviet unions doors to massive 
emigration that evangelicals were able to leave in large numbers 
among the flood of jews and ethnic germans 
however in an effort to save money and streamline the processing 
of the soviet applicants the administration has decided that all 
soviets seeking to come to the united states must apply at the us 
embassy in moscow starting oct 1 the rome and vienna facilities 
will be closed 
the plan calls for allocating 50000 refugee slots to soviet 
emigres in fiscal 1990 starting oct 1 far short of the estimated 
150000 expected to apply 
in addition according to state department figures the backlog 
of applicants most of them jews in rome and vienna will exceed 
30000 by oct 1 another 65000 are already in line in moscow 
the new plan means evangelicals may have to get in back of the 
moscow line and could wait as long as two years just for an 
interview with an ins officer about their application said serge 
duss who coordinates the soviet refugee program for the nae 
i am very disturbed by the administrations galloping ahead 
with the oct 1 deadline when many problems including the 
evangelicals havent been resolved morrison said there is no 
question they continue to be persecuted and deserve priority 
treatment 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said some evangelicals may get priority treatment even if they have 
not yet applied to leave 
but duss said that in private consultations his organization 
which claims 15 million members had not received any such 
assurances 
many evangelical christians believe glasnost is merely a 
breathing spell before more repression begins against religious 
activity he said 
in 1963 35 evangelical christians were turned away from the us 
embassy where they sought help in emigrating in 1978 seven 
pentecostal families known as the siberian seven found refuge in 
the basement of the us embassy where they stayed for five years 
until being allowed out 
since january 1988 some 12000 evangelicals obtained exit visas 
for vienna and rome where they applied for us refugee status in 
recognition of the persecution they suffered all but 5 percent were 
granted refugee status according to the immigration and 
naturalization service 
there are an estimated 800000 evangelical christians 
pentecostals baptists and methodists in the soviet union but only 
about 25000 of those want to leave 
the only reason they want to leave is so they can practice 
their religion duss said theyre the closest thing to the 
american pilgrim we have these days

senate democrats are taking another look at 
president bushs antidrug proposal in light of a republican offer 
to boost it by 800 million over the original plan 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd dwva 
said he would present the gop offer to his democratic colleagues 
today well take another look at the figures byrd said 
but he added that while the numbers may be flexible two 
principles in the more expensive antidrug package he proposed last 
week remain nonnegotiable a greater emphasis on drug treatment and 
prevention and an acrosstheboard cut of most federal programs to 
pay for the steppedup drug war 
the logjam over the size shape and funding of the war on drugs 
is holding up not only the antidrug package but also a series of 
spending bills needed to keep the government running after the 
current fiscal year ends sept 30 
byrd said his goal in demanding even cuts in defense and domestic 
programs is to avoid pitting program against program senator 
against senator as would occur if the money were sought from 
specific targeted agencies that could lead to even more delay in 
getting the spending bills through he said 
at a meeting in the capitol late tuesday senate republicans 
offered to add some 800 million to the 79 billion drug war bush 
outlined sept 5 and agreed to pay for about half of the 
improvements with an acrosstheboard spending cut of onefourth of 
1 percent 
the remaining 400 million in increased funding would come from 
cuts in a yettobeselected assortment of defense and domestic 
programs drawn from bushs original proposal said sen mark o 
hatfield rore the chief gop negotiator 
of the 800 million increase about 200 million would go to 
local law enforcement programs and 600 million would go for 
drugabuse prevention education and treatment programs 
weve talked to the agencies theres only so much money they 
can absorb at this time said sen orrin hatch rutah a member 
of the republican task force we dont want to just throw money at 
it we dont want to be stupid with this approach 
the new gop package represented a middle ground between bushs 
original proposal and a beefedup 101 billion package byrd 
proposed last week which put the emphasis on drug abuse prevention 
and treatment 
byrds proposal would finance the programs through a cut of 0575 
percent across the board on all discretionary domestic and military 
programs that would take a 18 billion bite out of the pentagon 
budget alone a cut deemed unacceptable by the white house 
the ball is in their court hatfield said tuesday he said 
bush administration officials who were present throughout the day 
including budget director richard darman had gone along with the 
sweetened offer but not willingly 
but the reality on capitol hill is that the drug issue holds a 
substantial political risk for anyone perceived not to be 
wholeheartedly in the fight hatfield said 
the president has captured the publics concern he said 
the down side is if the public perceives that congress is 
squabbling over nickels and dimes its not going to help any of 
us

amnesty international stepped up its campaign 
against capital punishment today appealing to the united states 
the soviet union china south africa iran and iraq to abolish it 
the londonbased human rights organization said it has documented 
at least 1600 legally sanctioned executions worldwide during the 
first eight months of this year but believes the true number to be 
much higher 
amnesty international has long opposed the death penalty calling 
it a cruel and unusual punishment inflicted disproportionately on 
the poor ethnic minorities and political opponents 
it released a study of capital punishment worldwide in april 
urging 100 countries to wipe it off their lawbooks today the 
organization said it was renewing its appeal to six countries 
because a change in their practices could turn the tide of 
statesanctioned killings 
amnesty also announced that its branches in 46 countries would 
lobby embassies of the six governments during the next week sending 
them hundreds of telex telephone and facsimile messages 
amnesty said 13 people have been executed this year in the united 
states and 37 in south africa 
it said at least one person is known to have been executed in the 
soviet union and five are awaiting imminent execution after losing 
their appeals for clemency it said the soviet union has refused to 
publish statistics on executions for more than 50 years 
precise figures are also difficult to obtain from iraq because of 
government secrecy but amnesty said hundreds are reported to have 
been executed there this year in iran there have been at least 
1200 executions in the same time period more than half for 
drugrelated offenses it said 
amnesty said that of 242 people known to have been executed in 
china this year 137 were killed after the armys bloody crackdown 
on the prodemocracy movement june 34 and included people accused 
of involvement in the protests 
it reiterated earlier concerns that the total of chinese 
executions was much higher 
amnesty said it was gravely concerned by legal and political 
developments regarding the death penalty in several countries in the 
last year 
it singled out a us supreme court ruling in june that the 
execution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded does not 
violate the constitution adding 
since the ruling was handed down at least one us prisoner 
believed to be mentally retarded has been executed horace dunkins 
aged 28 was electrocuted in the state of alabama on july 14 the 
first jolt of electricity failed to kill him reportedly because the 
electric chair had been wired incorrectly he was only declared dead 
19 minutes after the lever was first pulled 
on south africa amnesty cited the death sentence imposed on 14 
men and women in may in connection with the killing of a police 
officer 
it said 13 of the defendants were found only to have thrown 
stones at the officers house after security forces broke up a 
protest meeting near the town of upington but were convicted of 
sharing a common purpose in the murder 
this month the chief justice of south africas supreme court 
said 13 of the 14 could appeal both conviction and sentence and the 
other could appeal the sentence 
amnesty said that since april one country cambodia has 
announced its decision to abolish capital punishment 
moves for abolition are under way in several other countries it 
said including italy where lawmakers called in august for the 
death penalty to be removed from the countrys military penal code 
and switzerland where moves have been made in parliament to abolish 
the death penalty for all offenses 
in ireland two political parties in the governing coalition 
proposed in midjuly to abolish capital punishment in jamaica 10 
prisoners had their death sentences annulled in march and july some 
after having been on death row for 11 years and in hungary the 
death penalty was abolished for crimes against the state in june

the senate finance committee appears ready to 
salvage twothirds of catastrophic medical insurance for retirees 
but not before forcing the bush administration to take some of the 
heat for reducing benefits 
the panel is considering a plan by leaders of both parties that 
would reduce the surtax that pays for most of the program while 
repealing benefits for most prescription drugs and scaling back 
coverage for skilled nursing care 
but before the committee could begin discussion of that proposal 
tuesday sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the chairman abruptly 
adjourned a meeting because louis sullivan the secretary of health 
and human services was not on hand to answer questions 
i am deeply disappointed that dr sullivan is not here he has 
no more important measure before his department bentsen said i 
want to understand where the administration is on this issue 
an hhs spokesman said sullivan had personally told committee 
members earlier tuesday he could not attend the session he said he 
did not know whether sullivan would attend the committees meeting 
this afternoon 
william diefenderfer deputy director of the white house office 
of management and budget complained at tuesdays hearing that we 
are in a politically unstable situation with catastrophic 
bentsen and even some republican lawmakers have complained that 
the administration had offered little guidance on how congress 
should respond to heavy pressure from some older americans who want 
the catastrophic coverage changed 
bentsens tactic of adjourning tuesdays meeting is unlikely to 
affect the fate of the program but it does pull the administration 
into public debate over the issue and to share whatever blame there 
might be for reducing benefits 
still unknown is how many of the 33 million people eligible for 
medicare want the program to continue as is and how many of them 
want it scaled back most of the mail has been coming from opponents 
even if the committee were to approve the bipartisan plan for 
salvaging most of the program there will still be serious efforts 
on the floors of the house and senate to repeal it entirely 
the program was enacted a year ago to insure older americans 
against being bankrupted by a catastrophic illness 
some retirees who have catastrophic coverage financed by their 
former employers are fighting the mandatory program on grounds they 
dont need it other complaints comes from some of the 40 percent of 
retirees whose incomes are high enough that they pay more than 150 
a year in income tax they pay a 15 percent surtax that finances 
most of the program 
the package under consideration by the committee would 
reduce the surtax rate from 15 percent of income tax over 150 
to 12 percent and the maximum surtax this year from 800 per 
medicare enrollee to 585 
increase to 1780 starting in 1991 the annual amount of 
physicians fees a beneficiary would have to pay before the 
catastrophic program starts paying 100 percent of approved charges 
present law sets that copayment at 1370 
eliminate catastrophic coverage for most prescription drugs 
require that patients spend three days in the hospital before 
qualifying for coverage for care in a skilled nursing facility 
permit a retiree to drop catastrophic coverage but only if 
medicare part b coverage which pays physicians fees for routine 
illnesses is dropped as well 
under the proposal the cost of catastrophic coverage for the 
five years from 1989 through 1993 would drop from 42 billion to 
291 billion

larger grain crops this year are lowering costs 
for turkey producers and are paving the way for some bargains at 
supermarket poultry counters say agriculture department economists 
retail turkey prices dropped slightly in august after rising for 
five straight months according to the consumer price index 
announced tuesday by the labor department 
despite the decline less than half a cent per pound the 
average retail turkey price last month was still slightly more than 
104 per pound compared with 96 cents a year earlier 
usda economist larry witucki said he expects further declines the 
rest of the year and that there has been a lot of featuring going 
on by supermarkets to sell more turkeys 
witucki said in a telephone interview that usda analysts dont 
think the labor department surveys fully reflect the many price 
specials grocery stores feature on turkeys and many other products 
although retail turkey prices are easing down from their summer 
peak witucki said they may still average about 99 cents per pound 
for the entire calendar year up from 957 cents in 1988 but below 
the annual average of more than 101 in 1987 and almost 107 in 
1986 
meanwhile the departments economic research service said in a 
report to be published in the october issue of farmline magazine 
that lower prices for corn and soybean meal are expected to reduce 
turkey production costs in the last half of 1989 
economist mark weimar said production costs last year when 
droughtreduced crops drove up feed prices rose to as high as 73 
cents per pound of whole dressed turkey 
but with larger harvests in 1989 costs may decline to around 58 
cents per pound and possibly as low as 55 cents before the end of 
the year he said 
per capita consumption of turkey averaged 16 pounds in 1988 four 
times the rate in 1950 beef is still the leader at 727 pounds last 
year followed by pork 631 pounds and chicken 631 pounds but 
turkey is gaining 
today consumers do not have to buy a 14to20pound turkey in 
order to have a turkey meal weimar said rather they can 
choose a breast or a package of thighs 
other cuts such as drumsticks wings and tenderloins ground 
turkey sausage and lunch meats are some of the other choices that 
enable turkey to compete with fresh meats 
most of the increase in consumption is due to 
furtherprocessed turkey meaning cutup birds or processed 
meat but whole birds still comprise nearly 40 percent of the turkey 
americans eat 
the statistics show consumers are not necessarily willing to 
substitute turkey for beef or chicken but they are willing to 
substitute for pork the report said ham is turkeys biggest rival 
for shoppers attention

an agriculture department report says cigarette 
production is declining this year and so is the average smoking rate 
among americans for the 16th consecutive year 
total output is expected to drop from last years 695 billion 
cigarettes because of higher prices health concerns and smoking 
restrictions the departments economic research service said 
tuesday 
cigarette use may drop about 35 percent from last years average 
of 3096 cigarettes or fewer than 155 packs of 20 each the report 
said 
the average is for all americans 18 years and older smokers and 
nonsmokers alike it is a statistical comparison only and does not 
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population 
cigarette smoking peaked in 1963 at an average of 4345 more 
than 217 packs before beginning its longtime downward trend the 
annual average has blipped higher in several years but usda records 
show the last increase was in 1973 when it rose to 4148 cigarettes 
from 4043 in 1972 
total us tobacco production this year is up about 9 percent 
from 1988 mostly because of increased acreage the report said 
even with the larger crop and the continuing decline in us 
cigarette consumption fluecured the most abundant type of us 
tobacco auction prices are higher than a year ago the report 
said the higher prices result from tightening supplies because of 
reduced carryin old inventories a relatively good quality crop 
and higher price supports 
analysts said prospects for world tobacco use next season 
indicated a small increase in sales and use of cigarettes and 
unmanufactured tobacco us exports of unmanufactured tobacco 
leaf may rise a little from last season

a survey of sheep ranchers by agriculture 
department researchers shows flocks are less likely to be attacked 
by coyotes wild dogs and other predators if a burly guard dog is on 
watch 
the departments agricultural research service said tuesday that 
scientists began studying guard dogs 10 years ago at the us sheep 
experiment station in dubois idaho 
at that time the dogs were considered a novelty jeffrey s 
green a wildlife biologist at the station said in a report by the 
agency livestock producers who had guard dogs were thought to be 
foolish brave desperate or a combination of all three today much 
of the skepticism is gone 
green and his colleagues sent out 1000 questionnaires to 
ranchers and farmers who rely on the dogs to safeguard sheep cattle 
and goats 
more than 80 percent of the 399 who responded said a guard dog 
was well worth its initial cost of about 500 plus the dollar or 
two a day it takes to feed them green reported 
the dogs weigh 100 to 120 pounds and come from several breeds 
great pyrenees komondor akbash and anatolian green estimates that 
over the last decade as many as 8000 of the guard dogs have been 
used on 4000 ranches throughout the united states and canada

planning ahead is the key to hurricane safety 
and with hurricane hugo posing a threat to the united states 
residents of coastal areas may want to consider how to cope with the 
danger 
the storm surge a wall of water pushed ahead of these storms 
poses perhaps the greatest threat although high winds and flooding 
are also major hazards weather experts warn 
for lowlying communities evacuation is the safest measure and 
officials have warned that many fast growing communities lack plans 
and proper roads to get everyone to safety in the face of a 
fastapproaching storm 
the time needed to evacuate many coastal areas is greater than 
the available warning time the american meteorological society has 
said and many people are complacent or unaware of the danger with 
80 percent of the 40 million people living on the atlantic and gulf 
coasts never having experienced a hurricane 
it is imperative that coastal residents and visitors alike take 
the threat seriously and acquaint themselves with hurricane safety 
rules and evacuate immediately if advised to do so says robert 
sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral gables 
fla 
safety suggestions compiled by the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration and federal emergency management agency 
include 
keep track of the developing weather through local radio and 
television or noaa weather radio which broadcasts on special 
frequencies that can be received by inexpensive weather radios 
learn local evacuation routes and shelter locations if in a 
vulnerable area be prepared to leave and do so promptly if 
authorities recommend it 
keep the automobile fully fueled and make a supply of fresh 
water batteries and food is available 
tape board and shutter windows and tie down mobile homes before 
leaving wedge sliding glass doors to prevent them from lifting off 
their tracks 
bring in pets 
anchor small boats or move them to a safe shelter if there is 
time 
secure outdoor objects that might be blown away and become 
dangerous missiles these include such things as garbage cans 
garden tools signs porch furniture and so forth 
remain at home only if it is sturdy and not in an area subject 
to flooding if staying home keep away from windows fill 
containers and bathtubs with several days supply of water 
avoid loose or dangling wires and report them immediately to 
your power company report broken water mains since low pressure 
may hamper fire fighting 
after the storm has passed 
seek assistance if needed in red cross shelters 
stay away from disaster areas unless you are qualified to help 
be wary of flybynight repair services rushing into an area 
collecting money for work and then disappearing or doing shoddy 
repairs check references and wait if necessary 
check refrigerated food for spoilage if the power has been off

air travelers in smaller cities are benefiting 
from increased competition brought on by airline deregulation even 
though a few major airlines tend to dominate the major markets says 
an administration official 
assistant transportation secretary jeffrey n shane told a house 
panel tuesday that deregulation had brought the smaller cities more 
alternatives in airlines even as travelers in large cities are 
finding few choices 
shane there is an apparent paradox between increased 
concentration of air travel in a few big airlines at a few big hubs 
and more competition when the air travel system is viewed as a whole 
even though there are fewer carriers now than in 1979 when 
deregulation took effect he said some of those remaining had 
phenomenal growth as they expanded the scope of their operations 
from a regional to a national basis 
shane told the public works and transportation aviation 
subcommittee that the use of hub cities gave them a strong incentive 
to expand because they can crossconnect passengers at their hubs 
only if they provide service to the passengers ultimate 
destinations 
for example he said when piedmont decided to establish a 
hubbing center at charlotte nc it was little more than a 
regional carrier in the east 
for charlotte to succeed as a hubbing center piedmont had to 
and did expand service to major cities nationwide he said 
most other major carriers have matched this expansion of 
oceantoocean and bordertoborder route systems so while hubbing 
has resulted in high levels of concentration at connecting hubs it 
has also greatly expanded the numbers of competitors in smaller 
markets 
earlier studies have concentrated on hubs but shane said they 
have not distinguished between passengers who travel only to the hub 
and those who connect for other points 
most passengers at a hubbing airport fall into the latter 
category and they are typically able to enjoy competitive service 
from other carriers often many other carriers who offer connecting 
service from the same origins to the same ultimate destinations over 
different connecting hubs he said 
and contrary to widely held perceptions he said smaller cities 
that are the greater beneficiaries of the hubandspoke system of 
operation 
citing a department study of 1988 routes he noted akron ohio 
for example where piedmont was the only choice for people flying to 
piedmonts hub at dayton 
but he said passengers in akron also had access to six other 
cities that were hubs for other airlines and obviously when 
akron passengers move beyond one of the connecting hubs many 
competitive alternatives are typically available 
shane said akron illustrates the good news and bad news 
aspect of air travel under deregulation 
it simultaneously increases concentration at a connecting hub 
and creates competitive alternatives for passengers moving beyond 
the connecting hubs he said

the nations newspaper publishers say they 
favor using more recycled paper but decry as intolerable laws 
that would compel them to do so 
government should not impose mandatory quotas affecting 
newsprint use or purchasing the publishers said through a policy 
statement adopted by the board of directors of the american 
newspaper publishers association last week and made public tuesday 
governments should not intervene in determinations of newsprint 
quality 
the statement added regulating newsprint is regulating 
newspapers and it is intolerable in a free society 
so far 14 state legislatures have received proposals to steer 
newspapers toward the greater use of recycled paper anpa said 
connecticut is the only state to enact a law directing newspapers 
to use recycled paper the law would requires instate papers and of 
outofstate papers that have a connecticut circulation of over 
40000 to use recycled paper for 20 percent of their production by 
1993 and for 90 percent by 1998 
a florida law that took effect jan 1 imposes a 10cent per ton 
waste recovery fee for every ton of virgin newsprint use by a 
publisher and grants a 10cent credit for every ton of recycled 
newsprint used 
additionally anpa said proposals to require the use of recycled 
paper or to impose taxes on the use of virgin paper or grant tax 
credits for the use of recycled paper have been offered in 12 other 
states california illinois louisiana massachusetts nebraska 
new jersey new york north carolina oregon rhode island virginia 
and wisconsin with no final legislative action taken 
the harshest measure is one pending before the new york state 
legislature which would prohibit the sale of newspapers in the state 
after 1991 unless at least 10 percent of their paper was recycled 
paper 
while opposing such legislation the anpa statement called on 
newspapers to encourage recycling by providing a market for recycled 
paper 
recycling newsprint for reuse and for energy can help extend 
supplies of a valuable natural resource help extend the useful life 
of municipal landfills and help provide energy through 
environmentallysound incinerator facilities it said 
the statement also said 
old newspapers are already extensively recycled into many 
products and the newspaper business has worked hard to make that 
happen newspapers will be asking for more recycled newsprint and 
are working with newsprint manufacturers to help municipalities and 
recyclers to increase recycling 
more recycling can and will be accomplished but it will not be 
helped by government controls on the newsprint that makes a free 
press possible more voluntary effort will cause recycling to 
increase most quickly and efficiently meanwhile the development of 
additional products that use old newspapers the recycling of old 
newspapers to energy and some use of landfills will be necessary 
anpa said a task force chaired by frank a bennack jr president 
and chief executive officer of the hearst corp was looking into 
ways that newspapers communities collection agencies newsprint 
suppliers and government officials can cooperate in encouraging 
recycling

on the eve of new highlevel talks secretary 
of state james a baker iii is advising moscow to pull out of 
regional wars around the world and put the billions of dollars saved 
into the ailing soviet economy 
the former treasury secretary at a news conference tuesday also 
fired back at democratic critics of the bush administrations 
cautious foreign policy and sought to lower expectations that a date 
was about to be set for a superpower summit meeting 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is due to see 
president bush at the white house on thursday then baker and 
shevardnadze fly to jackson hole wyo for talks through sunday 
morning 
at their last meeting in paris in late july shevardnadze said 
if we prepare well and carefully then of course the summit will 
take place rather soon baker more cautious said at the time 
that obviously yes at some point a summit would take place 
at the news conference tuesday his first since taking over as 
secretary of state eight months ago baker was asked about a summit 
between bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
what i will say for you he replied is that it is 
anticipated and intended that we have a full discussion about the 
possibility of a summit 
bush said on monday i feel under no rush on that subject 
the stance struck by the president and his secretary of state 
reinforced the cautious character of us foreign policy 
particularly in dealing with the soviets and eastern europe 
turning to the sagging soviet economy baker said there are no 
simple or quick fixes but he suggested the soviets withdraw from 
conflicts in central america cambodia afghanistan cuba ethiopia 
and elsewhere 
besides contributing to international stability baker said it 
could also save the soviets billions of dollars that we still see 
spent in a disappointing pattern of support for those who fuel 
conflict 
he was especially harsh about soviet support for the marxist 
government of nicaragua 
while gorbachev promised to end direct soviet military aid to the 
sandinistas baker said weapons and other supplies were being 
channeled to them indirectly he apparently referred to cuba and 
some east european countries 
we think they the soviets could have a significant influence 
on reducing sandinista forces if they so chose baker said 
they are spending billions of dollars in regional conflict 
situations that we think could be put to better use to assist the 
process of perestroika he said using the russian word for 
reconstruction 
baker rejected democratic criticism that the bush administration 
was overly cautious on arms control and in responding to economic 
problems in eastern europe 
he said he hoped to conclude a chemical weapons agreement with 
shevardnadze by the weekend and baker announced that the bush 
administration will drop its proposal for a ban on us and soviet 
mobile missiles 
with bush urging congress to finance development of the 
singlewarhead midgetman baker acknowledged that the us 
negotiating position has been confusing 
he said his aim was to start the ball rolling in the 
slowmoving talks in geneva to reduce globegirdling us and soviet 
nuclear bombers submarines and missiles by 30 to 50 percent 
sen albert gore dtenn called bakers announcement a very 
small step that has long been awaited and expected because the 
proposal for a ban always was considered irrational even within the 
administration 
still gore said in an interview the decision to remove it now 
is symbolically important it points toward a reliance on 
singewarhead missiles by both sides which greatly reduces 
vulnerabilities and fears of aggression

a south carolina woman hit in the face with a 
shotgun blast a decade ago says congress should enact strong capital 
punishment laws and have executions carried out more swiftly 
the problem i see with the death penalty is the lengthy appeals 
process wanda summers of pawleys island sc told the senate 
judiciary committee on tuesday as it weighed capital punishment 
measures 
mrs summers at times composed and other times fighting back 
tears described how she was attacked and left for dead the night of 
feb 22 1979 when two men went on a murder spree that left four 
dead the one surviving attacker is now on death row 
i believe the terrible crimes he committed do warrant the death 
sentence said mrs summers he did not give the four other 
people the option of life or death 
mrs summers told the committee how she and a fellow worker at a 
convenience store were taken to a deserted road raped and 
shotgunned her assailant ronald woomer left her for dead 
she turned her head at the moment of the shotgun blast which 
took away part of her mouth and her jaw despite her wound she was 
able find help but her coworker died 
police found the assailants that night in a myrtle beach motel 
one of the assailants committed suicide woomer was captured 
convicted of murder and has been on death row since with his case on 
appeal 
mrs summers spoke in even tones as she told the committee how 
reconstructive surgery and psychiatric care have helped her she 
fought back tears however as she told of the pain inflicted on her 
family 
she also said it is hard to get up in the morning and look in 
the mirror 
its hard when little kids stare at you and adults try not to 
its hard to smile when you know how you look when you do 
the two assailants were drugged up on pcp and alcohol when 
they went on their rampage south carolina state solicitor james c 
anders said 
as part of last years antidrug law congress approved capital 
punishment for drug kingpins whose activities result in homicide 
a 1972 supreme court decision blocked use of a number of death 
penalty provisions then on the books calling unconstitutional the 
discretion the law allowed juries and judges on whether to impose 
execution 
as a result assistant attorney general edward sg dennis told 
senators a jury can impose the death penalty for the murder of a 
drug enforcement agent investigating a case but not for the murder 
of an fbi agent responding to a bank robbery 
legislation before the committee would restore the death penalty 
for murdering a member of congress the cabinet or the supreme 
court it would extend capital punishment provisions to murdering 
foreign officials and official guests kidnapping resulting in 
death attempted presidential assassination murder for hire and 
murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise

the bush administration is getting its way in 
the first test vote on clean air legislation but stiff tests still 
lie ahead for the pollutioncutting plan 
the bush forces outmaneuvered environmental groups tuesday in a 
1210 house subcommittee vote defeating a bid to toughen the 
administrations antismog requirements for cities less populated 
areas and small business 
the vote came as president bush challenged the democraticrun 
congress to quicken its pace on the legislation he commented at a 
spokane wash centennial treeplanting ceremony 
white house lobbyists who were credited by their chief opponent 
with making the difference tuesday must work even harder to save 
the most controversial part of the legislation letting automakers 
comply with antipollution requirements by averaging emissions of 
engine families 
the administration tuesday proposed a modification of the 
averaging language to make clear that pollution reduction goals 
must be met the issue could face a vote in the house energy and 
commerce environment subcommittee today with environmental groups 
making an allout attempt to halt the emission averaging proposal 
during the next several weeks the administration must defend 
against challenges to other portions of the bill 
it will try to preserve language to prevent growth of sulfur 
dioxide once it is reduced by 10 million tons over the next decade 
this provision could stunt the growth of electric utilities that use 
highsulfur coal the chief source of acid rain 
there also will be attempts to force the administration to accept 
nationwide costsharing of acid rain reduction a burden that may 
otherwise fall chiefly on nine states with dirty coalburning power 
plants the administration opposes costsharing believing the 
polluters should pay the cost 
the attempt to toughen the administrations proposed requirements 
for reducing urban smog failed under a barrage of criticism bush 
backers argued that jobs in small business would be lost areas 
statistically attached to cities in federal groupings would be 
forced to meet stiff pollutioncutting standards and cities could 
not meet the proposals deadlines 
we should never be in a posture where we legislate absurdity 
said rep william dannemeyer rcalif who supported bush rep 
john d dingell chairman of the full energy and commerce committee 
and chief democratic sponsor of the bush bill called the 
alternative harsh and punitive 
also working hard to defeat the plan was ranking committee 
republican norman f lent of new york 
the vote in the energy and commerce environment subcommittee was 
a defeat for the panels chairman rep henry a waxman dcalif 
champion of the environmental groups positions and sponsor of the 
amendment 
the white house took it very seriously and was working hard 
against it waxman said after a loss that followed a long day of 
political maneuvering 
the bush forces made the first major move of the day when lent 
backed by dingell introduced the administrations package that 
would modify auto emissions averaging 
while preserving the averaging concept the package would 
explicitly state that reductions in auto pollutants must equal the 
improvement that would be achieved if each car were forced to meet 
the emissions standards under current law each car must pass the 
test 
even though the bush plan would set tougher standards for 
automakers to meet environmentalists want to wipe out averaging 
altogether because it would allow some cars to flunk antipollution 
tests other cars would have to meet the standards with a 
considerable margin of safety 
environmental organizations argue that the margin of safety would 
not be enough to offset the cars failing to meet the requirements 
and emissions would rise 
other parts of the administration package would prevent a 
weakening of current law on pollution from tall smokestacks set 
requirements for planning and responding to toxic chemical 
accidents strengthen motor vehicle inspection and maintenance 
programs protect air quality in national parks and require 
diagnostic equipment on autos

it had the makings of a collectors item a 
campaignstyle button showing president bush alongside the nations 
topranking democrat house speaker tom foley bearing the 
inscription together 
ironically it came at a time when bush and the 
democraticcontrolled congress are at odds on a variety of issues 
including the environment bushs drug program crime taxes and 
education spending 
actually the button bearing sidebyside faces of bush and foley 
had nothing to do with politics even though it made bush and foley 
look like running mates it was a souvenir issued at a celebration 
on tuesday in spokane wash foleys hometown to commemorate 
washington states 100th anniversary 
the button given out to the several thousand who lined the banks 
of the spokane river at the citys riverfront park on tuesday to 
view the ceremony proclaimed together saluting washingtons 
centennial 
bush has been mixing treeplanting with politics on his trip out 
west to visit states celebrating their 100th anniversary 
although bush and foley traded compliments foley saying bushs 
visit was a proud moment for the state of washington and bush 
saluting the democratic leader as a man of integrity decency 
fair play there was underlying tension in the gettogether 
bush pushed for speedier congressional action on his proposed 
revision of the 1974 clean air act the environmental legislation is 
just one of many bush initiatives now in congressional limbo 
so far bush has sent to congress the bulk of his 1988 campaign 
agenda proposals on child care the environment crime drugs 
ethics adoption aid to poland and hungary 
and yet with only a week left before the start of the 1990 
fiscal year only a few of bushs initiatives have been addressed by 
congress 
bush as he has done on a budget blueprint and on the bill 
bailing out the savings and loan industry has signaled his 
willingness to compromise with the democratic leadership in congress 
ive been one who is chastised for too much compromise from 
time to time bush told a news conference in helena mont 
earlier this week 
even on his drug strategy bush administration officials have 
made it clear that theyre willing to deal on details of funding the 
war on drugs 
thus the bushfoley together buttons may point to a period 
ahead of accommodation with congress 
still foley who rode back to washington with bush on air force 
one was less than enthusiastic about the prospects for cooperation 
i think therell be plenty of disagreements foley said 
this is a divided government with democratic leadership of the 
congress and a republican president and i think were going to 
cooperate on a great number of things and were also going to have 
our disagreements 
foley said he disagreed with bushs charges that democrats were 
always seeking to spend more and tax more 
in a democratic society we ought to put our best ideas forward 
and see if we can come forward with the best of both the 
administrations approach and that of congress foley said 
sometimes constructive competition is not bad said the 
democrat

democrats renewing a fight with president bush 
they have already lost once this year are trying to increase the 
minimum wage without the lower pay scale for all new workers that 
republicans are demanding 
on a partyline voice vote tuesday the democraticcontrolled 
house education and labor committee bowed to bushs demand for an 
increase only to 425 but the bill would raise the minimum wage in 
two years instead of three and would set a subminimum wage only for 
firsttime workers 
labor secretary elizabeth dole repeated bushs vow to again veto 
any bill which raises federal wage floor to 425 in less than three 
years or that does not set a lower floor for six months for 
newlyhired workers 
bush vetoed a bill in june that called for three annual increases 
to 455 an hour by oct 1 1991 
the new bill would provide annual increases of 45 cents in 
january and again in january 1991 in the current minimum wage which 
has been 335 since 1981 
the committee chairman rep augustus f hawkins dcalif said 
the previous target was being reduced by 30 cents to gain support 
from southern democrats and some republicans for another expected 
attempt to override bushs veto 
there are some republican members ready to change their votes 
if the president doesnt compromise hawkins said 
senate sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the bill 
could be brought up there within the next three weeks just before 
congress recessed in august the senate labor and human resources 
committee again approved the same 455 minimum wage bill bush had 
vetoed although senators said it would likely be modified on the 
senate floor 
bush like former president ronald reagan has insisted on 
establishing a subminimum floor that would allow employers to pay 
any newly hired worker 20 percent less for up to six months 
regardless of the workers previous job experience 
democrats and unions who had bitterly opposed such a subminimum 
agreed for the first time earlier this year to a training wage 
but only for 60 days and only for firsttime entrants in the job 
market 
both republicans and democrats indicated a willingness tuesday to 
negotiate over their differences on the duration of the subminimum 
period but neither side is budging on who the lower floor applies 
to 
rep austin murphy dpa said bushs proposal would allow 
employers to pay a 340 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new 
hires in and out every 60 days to six months

the senate wants to boost the ceiling on 
housing loans insured by the federal housing administration by 
nearly 24000 a victory for the white house over democrats who 
wanted to eliminate the cap 
in a reversal of an earlier vote the senate voted tuesday to 
increase the current 101250 limit to 124875 that tally came 
shortly after lawmakers rejected an increase to 118000 in favor of 
democratic language to remove the ceiling entirely 
the provision is part of a bill providing 672 billion for 
housing veterans environmental and space programs for fiscal 1990 
which begins oct 1 the measure includes 185 billion for nasas 
space station program 16 billion for superfund toxic waste 
cleanups and 115 billion for veterans medical care 
the future of the fha loan ceiling language is in doubt however 
the house version of the bill approved july 20 contained no such 
language negotiators for the two chambers will have to fashion a 
compromise before it can be sent to president bush for his approval 
the new cap which would last for one year would boost home 
purchases by about 5 billion said aides to sponsor sen don 
nickles rokla it would pave the way for fha loans for more 
expensive homes to borrowers in metropolitan areas including boston 
new york city stamford conn washington dc san francisco los 
angeles and san diego they said 
the fha insured loans for the purchase of 855000 homes last year 
at an average cost of 63500 
the agency insures loans of up to 101250 or 95 percent of the 
cost of the median home in the state or metropolitan area whichever 
is lower the legal national limit of 101250 is higher in two 
states hawaii where it is 151850 and alaska where the maximum 
is 135000 
the bush administration announced its opposition to elevating the 
loan ceiling arguing that reforms were needed to avoid deepening 
the fhas financial problems the agencys main insurance loan fund 
lost 452 million last year its first losses since its founding in 
1934 and comptroller general charles bowsher has said it has very 
serious management problems 
if we want to have a son of sampl we have one in the making 
right here senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said 
likening the fhas problems to the massive bailout recently approved 
for the nations thrift institutions 
but with democrats standing firm behind their proposal to drop 
the cap entirely nickles began offering his amendments to set some 
limit on the size of the loan the senate rejected a 118000 
ceiling by 5049 but signed on to the nearly 125000 maximum 
5543 as most republicans were joined by several democrats 
nickles and his supporters argued that eliminating the cap would 
shift a greater share of the fhas monies to help welltodo home 
buyers lowincome borrowers couldnt afford expensive housing even 
with the ceiling removed they said 
democrats said however that rising housing costs have hurt 
hundreds of thousands of hardworking families whose dreams are 
being frustrated 
under the program the fha guarantees loans banks make to 
borrowers lowering the institutions risks and thus permitting them 
to offer more attractive terms 
although all work on the measure was completed final passage was 
held up pending resolution of a partisan dispute over an unrelated 
antidrug financing package

despite some strong us public criticism of 
tobacco exporting an industry official says tobacco sellers may 
succeed in getting thailand to lower its barriers to the sale of 
american cigarettes by the end of this year 
when thailand appreciates that certain norms have to be 
respected i expect they will devise some method of behaving to 
international market access standards said owen smith 
president of the us cigarette export association 
thailand syria and iran are the only noncommunist countries 
that ban the sale of us cigarettes smith told reporters at a 
hearing tuesday on his groups petition to force thailand to allow 
the sale and promotion of american cigarettes 
under threat of trade retaliation south korea japan and taiwan 
have opened markets to american cigarettes since 1986 offsetting a 
decline in us domestic sales 
thailands government runs a tobacco monopoly the cigarette 
association filed a petition with the us trade representative 
seeking government intervention after informal discussions with 
thailand didnt seem to be making headway smith said 
i hope it will be resolved toward the end of the year smith 
said at the hearing before a special committee of the us trade 
representative carla hills the us trade representative is to 
recommend to president bush by may 25 1990 whether to formally 
accuse the southeast asian country of unfair trade practices and 
order reprisals 
the tobacco exporters are facing opposition in the united states 
however with health organizations and other critics comparing their 
pursuit of asian markets to the 19th century opium war triggered 
by efforts of british merchants to force china to import narcotics 
the argument for selling cigarettes abroad resembles that used in 
the britain in 1840 that if britain did not profit from the sale 
of opium someone else would said dr anne marie okeefe vice 
president of americans for nonsmokers rights 
when we are pleading with foreign governments to stop the flow 
of cocaine it is the height of hypocrisy for the united states to 
export tobacco said us surgeon general c everett koop 
but gov jim martin of north carolina the major us 
tobaccogrowing state said that by raising health concerns the 
thais speak out of both sides of their mouths in a simple effort to 
protect the thai cigarette monopoly 
the thai government did not testify but two thai witnesses 
predicted the aggressive promotion of foreign cigarettes would 
reverse a decline in smoking recently achieved by a 15year campaign 
against tobacco use they justified the government tobacco monopoly 
system as a means of regulating and discouraging consumption under 
their national health policy 
where is the concern for humanity once felt by the united 
states asked thai parliament member surin pitsuwan he said 
promotion of us cigarettes in thailand could distract the asian 
country from working with the united states against growing of opium 
poppies and trafficking of heroin and other hard drugs

democratic national committee chairman ronald 
h brown says he believes the rev jesse jackson who recently moved 
to the district of columbia will run for mayor of the city next 
year 
most of the people close to jackson believe he will run 
and if he runs i think he will be elected brown told a group of 
reporters tuesday 
his remarks were published in todays editions of the washington 
post 
questions about a possible jackson candidacy arose as he moved to 
the district but he has not announced his candidacy and has said 
that he would not run against mayor marion barry who says he is 
seeking reelection 
brown said whether jackson runs for mayor in 1991 or for 
president the following year jackson will continue to be a 
significant force in democratic politics but the much more likely 
event is that he will run for mayor 
brown who was convention manager last year for jacksons run for 
the democratic presidential nomination said his remarks on a 
mayoral race were not based on any inside information 
i dont want to indicate that rev jackson has told me he is 
running for mayor brown said he has not confided that 
decision in me 
brown criticized barry who is being investigated as part of a 
federal probe into alleged drug dealing by barry associate and 
former city employee charles lewis 
theres no question theres been an erosion of support in the 
city but he seems determined to hang tough brown said and i 
doubt anything but legal proceedings will keep another barry 
campaign from happening 
barry said on monday that he still has no indication that jackson 
intends to run for mayor

former teamsters leader jimmy hoffa was killed 
because of union and underworld rivalries and his mutilated body 
was buried in concrete near the end zone at giants stadium in new 
jersey an exconvict says 
donald tony the greek frankos a selfdescribed freelance 
hitman told playboy magazine he was supposed to kill hoffa but was 
in prison when the labor leader disappeared on july 30 1975 so 
others killed him and described it to him later frankos said 
his account one of many over the years purporting to reveal what 
happened to hoffa appears in novembers playboy 
frankos said hoffa was shot in the forehead at a home near 
detroit his body dismembered in the basement then stored in a 
freezer until his burial in the football stadium near new york 
the fbi refused to say if it finds the account credible 
an official with the state commission of investigations in new 
jersey called the story possible but improbable 
and jim minish stadium assistant general manager said workers 
dug nearly 4 feet into the concrete while replacing the artificial 
surface during the past year and found nothing 
frankos a federally protected witness in the forthcoming new 
york trial of reputed mafia boss john gotti says he told the fbi in 
1986 that hoffa was killed by alleged irish mob boss jimmy coonan at 
a house in mount clemens mich 
frankos said that coonan armed with a 22caliber pistol with a 
silencer hit him twice in the forehead with the bullets 
exploded his brains 
with the help of john sullivan described by frankos as a mob 
hitman coonan carried the body into the basement 
they plugged in the bucksaw and they also had a meat cleaver to 
cut away any tendons frankos said 
on the table was all these blackplastic bags and cut rope 
coonan was cutting and sullivan was bagging em up coonan severed 
hoffas head and with a pocket knife cut a lock of hair from the 
side of hoffas head and kept it for good luck frankos said 
the body was placed in a freezer and several months later was 
trucked in an oil drum to the east rutherford nj site where 
giants stadium was under construction frankos said 
he said alleged mob affiliate joe mad dog sullivan no 
relation to john sullivan buried the remains at the stadium where 
the new york giants and jets play 
frankos said hoffa was slain in a dispute over his desire to 
regain control of the teamsters upon his release from a federal 
penitentiary where he was serving time for mail fraud and jury 
tampering a second motive frankos said was hoffas prison fight 
with tony tony pro provenzano a new jersey teamster official 
and reputed mobster 
coonan and joe sullivan are serving lengthy prison terms in 
unrelated cases frankos said provenzano is dead and john sullivan 
is the only one thats out there today who was an actual killer 
he said john sullivans whereabouts could not be determined 
fbi spokesman in chicago washington detroit and new jersey said 
they could not comment on the article because the hoffa 
investigation remains active 
we do believe that we have a much better understanding as to 
what happened and why it happened and who the participants were 
said john anthony an fbi spokesman in detroit the one piece to 
the puzzle that remains unsolved is the disposition of the body 
and of course the conviction of those involved he said 
frankos story is possible but its improbable said justin 
dintino chief of organized crime and intelligence with the state 
commission of investigations in new jersey 
in my opinion its somewhat unlikely he said i think the 
onus here is on the fbi if they take it serious enough to start 
digging up the meadowlands

columbia universitys marching band 
got a big laugh a few years back when they did a halftime routine 
that suggested the final resting place of jimmy hoffa might be right 
under their noses 
but new jerseys top sports official was not laughing tuesday 
about a playboy magazine report suggesting the former teamsters 
union leader may have been buried beneath giants stadium in east 
rutherford 
robert mulcahy president and chief executive officer of the new 
jersey sports amp exposition authority on tuesday called the report 
an unsubstantiated rumor 
mulcahy earlier referred to antics several years ago by the 
columbia band in which members formed an arrow pointing toward 
midfield purporting to point the way to hoffas body 
according to a report by a selfdescribed mob hitman in playboys 
november issue hoffa is buried next to the west end zone in the 
football stadium 
william steinman columbias sports information director said 
the team played four times at giants stadium in the late 1970s and

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in 
wyoming at a time of tumultuous change in superpower relations 
brought about by what both sides agree is a revolution in the 
soviet bloc 
the changes in the communist world have brought pressure on 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who is probably sending his 
foreign minister to the white house with new ideas for cuts in 
strategic arms experts say 
the installation of the first noncommunist regime in a warsaw 
pact nation since the cold war began 40 years ago also leaves the 
future of the soviet alliance uncertain 
the general secretary has called it a revolution and we would 
agree with that characterization baker said tuesday at the state 
department 
shevardnadze will see president bush at the white house on 
thursday before he and baker fly to jackson hole wyo for talks 
through sunday morning 
speaking in advance of the meeting baker said the administration 
was dropping a demand that had presented a major obstacle to 
conclusion of a proposed treaty to cut nuclear arsenals by up to 50 
percent 
the administration will no longer insist on elimination of mobile 
missiles baker said acknowledging the demand complicated the 
negotiations the soviets have already deployed two mobile missiles 
and the united states is developing two of its own 
administration officials say that although they have no advance 
word they are prepared for shevardnadze to push hard for arms 
control progress and say he may be carrying a new kremlin proposal 
when he meets bush 
it would be customary for shevardnadze to bring a letter from the 
soviet leader and gorbachev being gorbachev it would not be too 
surprising for it contain some dramatic proposals said one 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
since baker and shevardnadze last met in july a solidarityled 
government has been installed in poland the first noncommunist 
regime in the soviet bloc 
hungary another warsaw pact nation is also moving toward a 
multiparty system and has seen relations strained with an ally 
east germany over the flight of east germans to the west through 
the hungarian frontier 
the tremendous change in the nature of our discourse with the 
soviet leadership is primarily the result of unprecedented and 
exciting developments which are taking place in the soviet union 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said in a speech 
tuesday 
but the crackdown on prodemocracy forces in china and warnings 
by gorbachev of a possible conservative coup in the soviet union are 
reminders that moves toward freedom could be reversed and that 
ussoviet relations could worsen again 
gorbachev in reforming soviet foreign policy has withdrawn 
threatening tank forces from eastern europe and announced a cut of 
500000 in the red army 
the administration has reacted with restraint to the changes so 
far however leading to criticism from some members of congress who 
want the white house to encourage change in the soviet union and 
supply more aid to nations like poland that are adopting reforms 
the white house announced in the past week plans to double food 
deliveries to poland to 100 million and grant hungary most favored 
nation status to reduce tariffs on hungarian exports to the united 
states 
the administration has also tried to expand the ussoviet 
dialogue into such areas as fighting terrorism and drug trafficking 
and cleaning up the environment 
today we are witnessing what are potentially the first steps 
in the transformation of a totalitarian society into one governed by 
the rule of law eagleburger told a meeting of the national 
conference on soviet jewry 
and as these changes unfold the relationship between the 
united states and the soviet union could move from an adversarial to 
a cooperative one he said 
although the united states is dropping its demand to ban mobile 
missiles other sticking points remain in the proposed strategic 
arms reduction treaty start 
shevardnardze and baker meeting in the shadow of the grand 
tetons in wyoming are expected to announce several important steps 
on other topics including the environment chemical weapons and the 
verification of treaties on testing the largest nuclear weapons

deformities in interethnic relations the baneful effects of 
excessive centralization and bureaucratic administration and 
injustices done to a number of peoples have recently come under 
extensive and harsh criticism 
if somebody today claims that in terms of national development 
and interethnic relationships soviet power has not wrought 
essential changes as compared to the situation in prerevolutionary 
russia he is engaged in dishonest distortion of reality intended to 
whip up nationalistic passions and to motivate various extremist 
demands 
there are no grounds to question the decision by the baltic 
republics to join the ussr and the choice made by their peoples 
it is also clear that the soviet leadership taking a variety of 
measures to strengthen the countrys security in the face of the 
nazi threat committed gross violations of the leninist principles 
of foreign policy which rejects division into spheres of influence 
we resolutely condemn this 
the outrages against ethnic groups and their banishment from 
their native parts during the great patriotic war must be condemned 
we should do everything to restore the flouted rights of the soviet 
germans crimean tatars meskhetian turks kalmyks balkars 
karachais chechens ingushes greeks koreans and kurds 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from this point of view the gamut of measures affected as part 
of perestroika means a new and landmark stage in implementing 
nations rights to selfdetermination 
in presentday conditions the principle is best reflected in 
selfmanagement protecting ethnic identity and the right of each 
ethnic group to enjoy all the fruits of sovereignty and to decide 
all issues of its development economic political and cultural 
as it sees fit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the current phase in the selfdetermination of nations makes it 
imperative to markedly broaden the rights of republics and 
decisively remove the distortions and deformities of the past whose 
adverse effects are still being felt in various areas of societys 
life 
while the union will retain the powers needed to perform the 
common tasks of the federation it is proposed to make fundamental 
changes to earlier procedures whereby the union had the right to 
take up and decide virtually any issue making the competence and 
sovereignty of republican authorities in many ways a mere formality 
to embark now on recarving the countrys administrative and 
territorial map would mean only complicating what is already a 
difficult solution to delay indefinitely the attainment of the real 
goals of perestroika which aim to imrove the life of the whole of 
the soviet people all nations 
our new nationality policy is designed to provide broad 
possibilities for meeting the specific interests of every nation and 
at the same time strengthening the guarantees of citizens rights 
irrespective of their nationality 
we encounter ever increasing attempts by enemies of perestroika 
antisocial elements and groups to play the nationalist card to 
channel peoples displeasure which has accumulated over decades 
into the sphere of interethnic relations any manifestation of 
nationalism and chauvinism or the instigation of enmity to any 
nation are unacceptable to us 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in modern conditions attempts by relatively prosperous 
republics and regions to isolate themselves and fence themselves off 
would be extremely dangerous this can bring fairly negative 
consequences for those who embark on this road 
we need at this plenary meeting to say this once again in the 
face of all peoples of the soviet union so that they do not give in 
to demagogues who conceal what the implementation of their slogans 
served under the pleasant sauce of independence secession etc 
may lead to this is irresponsible gambling with the destinies of 
the people 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we are on the correct path and we should be firm in defending the 
chief directions of the policy of perestroika it is being claimed 
that we are unable to resolve problems facing the country without 
introducing capitalism into the economy 
on the other hand i would say from the right it is being 
claimed that the entire policy of perestroika was imposed on us by 
the west this is nonsense

from the serene stillness of a lake 
2000 miles away amateur radio operator glenn baxter oversees a 
bustling network that is providing a vital link to the 
hurricaneravaged caribbean 
baxter is the manager of the international amateur radio network 
whose 2000 members in 45 countries volunteer their expertise and 
equipment to help disaster victims obtain emergency aid or contact 
worried relatives 
its like a worldwide volunteer fire department said the 
47yearold baxter 
a sampling of messages that had accumulated since hurricane hugo 
began its devastation sunday included a facsimiled query from the 
los angeles county sheriffs department seeking information about a 
person in antigua 
an australian radio operator was trying to track down someone in 
san juan puerto rico a maine woman anxious about her daughters 
safety in st croix broke down crying while talking by telephone 
with baxter 
this is so important this lady is hurting inside baxter 
said tuesday and were the only ones that can help her feel 
better 
the network born in the aftermath of the 1985 mexico city 
earthquake also works with the red cross and the salvation army in 
directing disaster assistance to the areas that need it most 
occasionally the local ham operators themselves make arrangements 
for medical supplies and equipment 
baxter takes special pride in the speed with which the network 
can reach disaster areas communicating with victims while official 
relief efforts are still gearing up 
were there in minutes he said they take days 
baxter himself also has become a source of information for 
several news organizations relaying recorded transmissions from ham 
operators at the scene and gathering details that are impossible to 
obtain otherwise in the hours following a disaster 
im their roving reporter said baxter a pleasant talkative 
type who said he agreed on a moments notice to go on the air live 
with the british broadcasting corp on tuesday morning im just 
pumping for informaton because we need it just like they do 
messages to and from the caribbean began flowing in earnest 
monday and by midafternoon tuesday the network had dispatched 
about 1200 using voice transmissions as well as material that is 
written on computers and transmitted by shortwave radio signals 
each inquiry is given a code so that responses can be expedited 
baxter said 
on the islands at least 100 radio operators were communicating 
with network members in other parts of the world tuesday and baxter 
was working to assemble teams of operators from other countries to 
travel to the caribbean to spell weary resident operators 
the network which last year provided services to victims of 
hurricane gilbert and the armenian earthquake maintains a decidedly 
humble world headquarters 
the small wooden building next to baxters home on great pond in 
this central maine town 65 miles north of portland is crammed with 
radio consoles computers and other equipment radio signals are 
beamed from antennas mounted atop 75foot pine trees the lake 
provides a natural buffer from interference 
baxter who is trained as an industrial engineer works parttime 
in the same building repairing equipment sent to him from other ham 
operators but when disaster strikes he plunges fulltime into the 
network

it had the makings of a collectors item a 
campaignstyle button showing president bush alongside the nations 
topranking democrat house speaker tom foley bearing the 
inscription together 
ironically it came at a time when bush and the 
democraticcontrolled congress are at odds on a variety of issues 
including the environment bushs drug program crime taxes and 
education spending 
actually the button bearing sidebyside faces of bush and foley 
had nothing to do with politics even though it made bush and foley 
look like running mates it was a souvenir issued at a celebration 
on tuesday in spokane wash foleys hometown to commemorate 
washington states 100th anniversary 
the button given out to the several thousand who lined the banks 
of the spokane river at the citys riverfront park on tuesday to 
view the ceremony proclaimed together saluting washingtons 
centennial 
bush has been mixing treeplanting with politics on his trip out 
west to visit states celebrating their 100th anniversary 
although bush and foley traded compliments foley saying bushs 
visit was a proud moment for the state of washington and bush 
saluting the democratic leader as a man of integrity decency 
fair play there was underlying tension in the gettogether 
bush pushed for speedier congressional action on his proposed 
revision of the 1974 clean air act the environmental legislation is 
just one of many bush initiatives now in congressional limbo 
so far bush has sent to congress the bulk of his 1988 campaign 
agenda proposals on child care the environment crime drugs 
ethics adoption aid to poland and hungary 
and yet with only a week left before the start of the 1990 
fiscal year only a few of bushs initiatives have been addressed by 
congress 
bush as he has done on a budget blueprint and on the bill 
bailing out the savings and loan industry has signaled his 
willingness to compromise with the democratic leadership in congress 
ive been one who is chastised for too much compromise from 
time to time bush told a news conference in helena mont 
earlier this week 
even on his drug strategy bush administration officials have 
made it clear that theyre willing to deal on details of funding the 
war on drugs 
thus the bushfoley together buttons may point to a period 
ahead of accommodation with congress 
still foley who rode back to washington with bush on air force 
one was less than enthusiastic about the prospects for cooperation 
i think therell be plenty of disagreements foley said 
this is a divided government with democratic leadership of the 
congress and a republican president and i think were going to 
cooperate on a great number of things and were also going to have 
our disagreements 
foley said he disagreed with bushs charges that democrats were 
always seeking to spend more and tax more 
in a democratic society we ought to put our best ideas forward 
and see if we can come forward with the best of both the 
administrations approach and that of congress foley said 
sometimes constructive competition is not bad said the 
democrat

us housing secretary jack kemp called on 
americans to meet their obligation to society saying the work of 
volunteers is absolutely essential to conquering the problem of 
homelessness 
there are people in this country who are hurting those that 
have been blessed have an obligation to be a blessing to someone 
else kemp said in a speech to a group of federal officials 
tuesday 
the secretary of the department of housing and urban development 
pledged to cut red tape and improve coordination among government 
agencies and nonprofit groups who help the homeless 
kemp portrayed the fight against homelessness as part of a wider 
battle against poverty and despair 
kemps pep talk to the interagency council on the homeless where 
he announced a rentsubsidy grant program followed a tour of a 
homeless shelter that was empty for the day and a visit to a soup 
kitchen where he was jeered 
meanwhile in an interview published in the new york times today 
kemp proposed ways to rid the troubled hud agency of 
influencepeddling he said he would seek to base the awarding of 
subsidies on merit rather than on the discretion of department 
officials and to require that consultants register their fees 
im not chairman of the republican national committee kemp 
said funding decisions will be based on objective criteria 
competition merit and need not who you know or what your party 
is 
under kemps predecessor samuel pierce hud officials steered 
housing subsidies to developers who had hired politically connected 
gop consultants 
kemp said he would propose a mix of administrative regulatory 
and legislative measures as well as making all financing decisions 
public 
at the st elizabeths house soup kitchen in hartford kemp was 
surrounded by reporters and photographers in the doorway and never 
made it inside the room for a complete tour 
his speech gave an outline for what he termed the first steps 
in the effort to end homelessness he said the government would cut 
through red tape and make it easier for homeless people and those 
who provide for them to receive government assistance 
we would not be a moral society we would not be a 
judeochristian society if we did not recognize our obligation 
kemp said 
kemp conceded that government procedures have resulted in a poor 
record for helping the homeless he said that since 1983 only 293

a new state law punishes parents whose 
children skip school and black parents are being warned it could be 
used to force an end to the classroom boycotts they use to air 
grievances 
the law intended to cut truancy makes parent of truants under 
age 17 subject to a maximum of one year in jail and 1000 fine 
during the last few years classroom boycotts have been used to 
put pressure on school officials to address blacks grievances 
boycotting is the only effective tool that a minority of any 
class or group of people have to sustain their rightful place in 
society said robert phillips a former school board member in 
lowndes county in northeast mississippi who is leading a boycotting 
parents group 
phillips whose granddaughter is among about 385 pupils 
boycotting the new motley elementary school said parents arent 
worried about the truancy law 
it must be some scare tactics of the school board i imagine 
phillips said in a telephone interview tuesday the jails not 
going to hold all of us anyway were going as a package and not as 
individuals 
tom saterfiel deputy state superintendent of education said 
mississippi officials are warning parents of the consequences if 
they dont enroll their children within 15 days after the start of 
the school year or permit their child to accumulate more than 10 
unexcused absences during the year 
if the truant officers see that we have some kids absent more 
days than the law allows then they petition the judge and the judge 
would decide whether to take action against the parents saterfiel 
said 
he noted that state officials are most concerned about 15 and 
16yearolds who are legally required to attend school for the first 
time this year under the states amended 1982 education reform act 
mississippi traditionally has had among the highest dropout rates 
in the nation last year 325 percent or about one third of the 
mississippi students who had completed eighth grade failed to get a 
diploma however thats down from a 40 percent dropout rate in 1980 
during a meeting last week of the black parents angry with the 
lowndes county school board the use of the compulsory attendance 
law against them was raised 
state rep alfred walker of columbus warned the parents of 
boycotting motley elementary school students that they could be 
prosecuted if they keep their children out of class more than 10 
days 
i came strictly to inform them of the compulsory law and its 
consequences walker said after the parents meeting 
the parents say their children wont attend the school until the 
newly elected school board agrees to give it the name approved while 
the school was under construction martin luther king jr 
elementary school 
the parents also said theyre upset the cafeteria and library 
wasnt completed before the school opened last week 
but more than 350 people at the meeting called by the lowndes 
county chapter of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people and the west lowndes parents group said they werent 
worried about the truancy law and were willing to face the 
consequences 
school board president gary chism failed to return phone calls 
for comment however the school board voted monday night to try to 
set up meetings with the black parents group and phillips said 
discussions had been tentatively scheduled for friday

busy shoppers and tourists from the 
bustling cruise ship trade clogged downtown nassau displaying only 
modest concern that hurricane hugos 105 mph winds were blowing a 
few hundred miles offshore 
on tuesday the government issued no emergency instructions or 
orders no evacuation route signs were visible about the city no 
emergency shelters were set up and there was no sense of urgent 
storm preparation 
the prime minister lynden pindling was out of the country 
pindling left the archipelago monday for a commonwealth finance 
ministers meeting in kingston jamaica he was to head to 
washington dc at weeks end 
forecasters early today said that if hugo maintained its current 
path it would continue moving parallel to the bahamas bringing 
high winds and rains to the islands but not the death and 
destruction seen in other parts of the eastern caribbean 
officials at the bahamas meteorological department in nassau said 
late tuesday however there was cause for concern 
its not enough to deliver a devastating blow said 
meteorolgist nicholas small but its not far enough away for us 
to relax were going to get a healthy tropical wind ranging between 
39 and 73 mph and possibly higher in gusts 
the government has begun some preparations a work crew began 
boarding up windows of government buildings reuben henderson 
nailing plywood sheets over windows on a government office building 
said he and his crew had been given those instructions 
dorothea seymour a shopkeeper in the busy downtown straw market 
didnt seem too concerned 
some people care some people dont she said were always 
hearing about storms but they never come 
with her business 15 feet from nassau harbour ms seymour said 
if the storm came she would simply pack up her stock of straw 
handbags dolls hats and tshirts 
four cruise ships were tied up at prince george wharf just yards 
away their passengers browsing through shops about the city 
we have not had any cancellations of cruise ships said 
cordell thompson a spokesman for the ministry of tourism and 
there have been no cancellations of air service 
thompson said he didnt think the bahamas could avoid hugos 
effects altogether 
i suspect were going to get a lot of rain and a lot of high 
winds he said 
if the hurricane made a sharp turn to the northwest or the west 
toward the bahamas we might start getting nervous thompson 
said 
few vacationers appeared worried about facing a hurricane on new 
providence the bahamas most populous island 
michael belt and his wife rachelle of henderson ky were 
among them

director billy wilder actor james stewart and 
other members of the film industry joined in praise of the library 
of congress list of 25 films deemed culturally historically or 
esthetically significant 
im delighted responded wilder on tuesday his some like 
it hot and sunset boulevard appeared on the list 
i wish things would go forward to reconstruct those films as 
they were not colorized and not butchered by cuts 
also on the list was frank capras mr smith goes to 
washington which starred stewart 
the first thing that crossed my mind is that im glad that 
frank is still with us and can enjoy his vindication stewart 
said capra has been in failing health at his home in la quinta 
stewart made his comments in washington dc before a visit to 
the senate to campaign for film preservation he recalled the 
premiere of the movie at constitution hall in 1939 senators became 
restive at the films depiction of political corruption 
the film broke during the screening stewart recalled and by the 
time capra returned to his seat after climbing to the booth to 
repair it half his audience was gone the press was 
completely against the picture too 
the aim of the list said librarian of congress james h 
billington in announcing the first 25 was to promote movies as an 
american art form and generate public interest in preservation 
i think its as good a list as we can expect the first time 
out said dave kehr a member of the national film preservation 
board and chairman of the national society of film critics a board 
of 13 film figures made the final selection drawing from a thousand 
nominations from the public 
the major surprise among the selections for the national film 
registry was the the learning tree a semiautobiographical film 
of a black boys rural childhood by gordon parks famed life 
magazine photographer 
im surprised pleasantly so said parks at his new york 
residence im very happy the film was very well received in its 
release and its still playing in europe and on television here 
the national film registry is the outgrowth of protests by 
filmmakers over colorization and editing for television of classic 
films congress last year passed the national film preservation act 
which called for the naming of 25 classic films annually for three 
years 
im delighted to be one of the 25 but im horrified at the 
necessity of the act said stanley donen the director of the 
musical singin in the rain 
donen said that the act will do nothing to keep broadcasters from 
editing movies for length or duplicating them with poor quality 
control onto videocassettes 
wilder was his usual acerbic self in calling for greater 
protection for films the television people call in a butcher who 
has failed at the ralphs grocery store to supervise the cutting of 
pictures so they can slip in the noxema commercials frankly nobody 
gives a 
there were other surprises besides the learning tree 
dw griffiths mishmash of history intolerance was 
selected but not his classic the birth of a nation perhaps 
because of its sympathetic portrayal of the ku klux klan 
king vidors the crowd was included but not his more 
impressive the big parade john ford westerns are represented by 
the searchers and not his landmark stagecoach 
among the missing the treasure of the sierra madre its a 
wonderful life it happened one night all about eve 
shane top hat the african queen rebecca from 
here to eternity 
besides wilder double selections were victor fleming who 
directed both gone with the wind and the wizard of oz in 
1939 and ford the grapes of wrath and the searchers 
the top movies listed alphabetically were 
the best years of our lives 1946 casablanca 1942 
citizen kane 1941 the crowd 1928 dr strangelove or 
how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb 1964 the 
general 1927 gone with the wind 1939 the grapes of 
wrath 1940 high noon 1952 intolerance 1916 the 
learning tree 1969 and the maltese falcon 1941 
also mr smith goes to washington 1939 modern times 
1936 nanook of the north 1922 on the waterfront 1954 
the searchers 1956 singin in the rain 1952 snow white 
and the seven dwarfs 1937 some like it hot 1959 star 
wars 1977 sunrise 1927 sunset boulevard 1950

wharton middle school about 9 am tuesday and whispered he would 
kill her if she did not give him her money she said the man never 
displayed a gun but a bulge was visible under his sweatshirt 
hudson 49 said the children did not realize what was going on 
at first 
i was frightened because i didnt know what he might do she 
said anyone who would come into a classroom of students with the 
police next door meant business and could hurt somebody 
hudson who has taught for 26 years in metro schools told her 
students they could assist police by writing down what they saw 
we told them we were not going to give them a grade on

dissident chinese students have spiced up their 
message of democracy with a new rock n roll beat 
the student leaders mixed politics and rock at a boston recording 
studio taping three songs they hope will climb to the top of the 
democracy charts 
they were pretty good singers said harry king who is 
coproducing the tape i was shocked politicians usually arent 
good singers 
the students recorded three songs sunday the titles translated 
from chinese are hold on until tomorrow back to the square 
and for momma king said 
the rockers include wuer kaixi best known as the student who 
challenged chinas premier li peng before troops stormed 
prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square in beijing the 
others are liu yan who escaped with wuer and shen tong who was 
on the chinese mostwanted list when he escaped from china 
wuer is now a student at harvard university shen is at brandeis 
and liu is studying at boston university 
money earned by sales of the tapes will go to a democracy for 
china fund shen said but money wasnt on the students minds when 
they made the recording the songs in chinese are one more way to 
keep the democracy movements message alive shen said the students 
plan to distribute the tape in hong kong and taiwan 
a lot of people travel between hong kong and china he said 
if the song becomes very popular and its in everybodys mouth 
its easy to spread in china 
shen wrote the words to for momma a dialogue between a 
mother and her son its a mother very worried if her son is 
safe said shen 21 whose father died about a month ago in china 
the three students used a backup band whose sound is similar to 
bruce springsteens king said but shen likened the songs to the 
slower rock he prefers like the beatles and simon and 
garfunkel shen said he sang songs like the sound of silence in 
high school 
the music was written by jimmy jang who approached the students 
with the idea shen said musicians donated their time and the 
studio soundtrack did the recording at bargainbasement prices 
king said 
ordinarily it would cost about 45000 to produce three songs in 
a studio king said he estimated the tapes will cost only about 
1200 
a taiwanese television station taped the recording session for a 
news program and may try to edit that into a video for a variety 
show said yueh chiou a correspondent for the station 
the students also may try to distribute the tape in the united 
states i really want american students and american people to 
know about the movement too shen said 
shen a biology major said he isnt prepared to give up his 
studies if rock stardom comes his way liu speaking through an 
interpreter echoed his sentiments 
i have no intention to become a rock star but i want to be a 
good student she said

the fragments of a lost french airliner which 
disappeared mysteriously with 171 people abroad are strewn across a 
sunbaked moonscape of southeastern niger best reached by camel 
a french air force plane sighted the wreckage between the chadian 
capital of ndjamena and the niger city of agadez ancient 
crossroads of tuareg tribesmen who roam the remote region 
rescuers found debris near the rocky crags of the termit 
outcroppings on a west african sea of rolling sands and scrubby 
trees for years a center of fierce drought and passing famine 
uta flight 772 heading to paris from brazzaville in the congo 
passed over lake chad heading northward toward the uraniumrich air 
mountains it lost contact after leaving ndjamena 
colonial literature is rich in explorers tales of the desolate 
region which the french fought hard to subdue in 1897 commandant 
toutee he used no first name was reminded of egypt 
more recent visitors are struck by the same characteristics vast 
sweeps of multihued emptiness sharp breaks in terrain blazing hot 
days and cold nights and silence 
after some attempts at settlement it is still the unchallenged 
domain of the tuareg the fabled blue men of the desert who 
float through occasionally on their way to somewhere else 
french administrators once built a locustcontrol center in the 
village of termit at the center of the 60mileacross mountain 
chain after independence niger kept a small military post there 
now termit is peopled by a few dozen residents in crumbling old 
barracks and mud hovels visited only occasionally by tuareg 
caravans which stray off their preferred bilmaagadez route across 
easier terrain to the north 
the french petroleum company elf built a short packedearth 
runway near termit several years ago but its use is limited and it 
is not listed on aeronautical charts 
when the parisdakar rally passed through the region in january 
only a handful of small aircraft and a dc3 were able to set down on 
the 2600foot strip 
fourwheel drive vehicles can negotiate much of the zone but 
progress is slow sometimes impossible over the wide corridors of 
high dunes the sharp ravines and the dry watercourses 
even in times of plenty medical supplies fuel and food are in 
measured stocks nigers capital niamey is a hard days drive from 
agadez the nearest major urban center to the crash site

tried for those offenses 
the death penalty was made for people like james paster said 
state district judge ted poe who presided over pasters trial 
pasters execution was the 118th in the nation since the 1976 
us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume capital 
punishment it was the third execution this year in texas and the 
32nd since 1982 the most of any state since the supreme courts 
decision 
about three dozen death penalty opponents gathered outside the 
prison before the execution chanting say no to death row and 
reject the injection 
the texas court of criminal appeals on tuesday refused to grant 
paster a reprieve and his attorneys declined to appeal to the 
federal courts last week the us supreme court rejected an 
emergency request 
howards exwife trudy howard leblanc 42 is serving a life 
prison term for hiring paster and brothers gary and eddie leblanc to 
commit the murder 
eddie leblanc 34 also is serving life while gary leblanc who 
paster said hired him gave him the gun and drove him to the murder 
site is serving a 35year term in exchange for his testimony 
paster served time in california and was in custody in alabama 
when he was arrested for the howard killing california officials 
described him as having serious sexual problems and the potential 
for being extremely dangerous texas prison documents described him 
as satan personified 
if you knew me i would be an unforgettable character paster 
said im a very likable individual

zsa zsa gabors copslapping trial 
took a bizarre twist even by hollywood standards with the actress 
bolting the courtroom in tears on the day her accuser was injured in 
a traffic accident 
the flamboyant miss gabor also took the witness stand tuesday and 
testified that her june 14 arrest by officer paul kramer had 
frightened her more than the nazi invasion of her native hungary 
during world war ii 
he hated me i could see it in his eyes said the 66yearold 
former miss hungary he was very handsome but he was very scary 
to me 
the star of such movies as picture mommy dead and queen of 
outer space was to continue her testimony today 
earlier tuesday she bolted the courtroom shouting i cant 
take this its a lie as another officer who assisted kramer 
testified that she cursed him and threatened to use her friendship 
with former president reagan to get him fired 
as the trial continued in the afternoon kramer suffered a head 
injury and severe cuts and bruises when his motorcycle collided with 
a police car 
the officer who was answering an emergency call in pursuit of 
suspected gunmen was treated at a hospital and released 
miss gabor admitted tuesday she scuffled with the 6foot4inch 
officer after he pulled her over for having expired license tags on 
her rollsroyce 
im a hungarian woman not a milquetoast she said 
but she added that she acted in selfdefense 
it was in selfdefense she said he was unbelieveably 
insulting he can only talk to a streetwalker like that not to a 
lady 
kramer a foot taller and 100 pounds heavier than miss gabor 
testified the attack was unprovoked 
the beverly hills cop stopped the actress twice on june 14 the 
second time after she drove away as he attempted to cite her when 
he closed in on her a second time she testified she feared he was 
going to shoot her 
i was saying to myself uh oh zsa zsa gabor now youve had 
it 
she said kramer cursed her during both traffic stops dragged her 
out of her car and handcuffed her 
i screamed officer youre hurting me and he liked it he was 
smiling he was enjoying hurting me she told the court 
earlier officer scott thompson testified that miss gabor cursed 
him as he assisted kramer 
she looked at me and said you expletive im having your 
job im calling the reagans on this thompson testified miss 
gabor a longtime friend and neighbor of the former president got 
up and left at that point 
defense attorney william graysen immediately led her back into 
the courtroom and she broke down in sobs municipal judge charles g 
rubin ordered a recess while she regained her composure 
until tuesday miss gabor had been relatively calm during the 
trial doodling on a pad and sketching pencil portraits of the 
judge clerk bailiff and even a respectable rendition of kramer 
miss gabor is charged with batery on a police officer disobeying 
an officers orders driving with an expired license and having an 
open container of alcohol a flask of jack daniels whiskey in the 
glove compartment in her car 
if convicted she faces a possible 18month jail sentence

early today after serving 8 months for shooting four teenagers in 
1984 turned down the citys standard offer of a ride to the nearest 
subway stop 
goetz was led out a side door of the brooklyn center of 
detention avoiding eight camera crews and about 30 photographers 
and reporters 
he did not want to face the news media said pete mahon the 
jails deputy chief of operations

hero among those who saw him as an individual taking a stand against 
crime he had been a selfemployed electronics calibrator before his 
arrest 
ryles said goetz whiled away much of his time playing chess with 
inmates in an 18cell protective custody block others in the block

southern baptists should be incensed by a 
government report calling homosexuality natural and healthy and 
blaming fundamental religion for many suicides among homosexual 
teens a church leader says 
albert lee smith spokesman for the denominations lobbying 
effort in washington dc told top church officials on tuesday 
that southern baptists should register their dismay with congress 
over the task force report by the us department of health and 
human services 
taxpayer dollars are being used to promote something completely 
contrary to baptist convictions smith told the southern baptist 
conventions executive committee during its semiannual meeting 
smith an alabama congressman from 198182 outlined a plan to 
contact congressmen and government officials and to organize 
grassroots campaigns on such churchstate matters 
the greatest asset we have on legislation is the numbers of 
baptists the birmingham layman said of the 148 millionmember 
denomination 
the report published in january and written by san francisco 
therapist paul gibson explores the high risk of suicide among 
homosexual youths 
the report noted that homosexual teenagers were unduly pressured 
in fundamentalist churches such as the southern baptist church and 
traditional faiths such as catholicism to renounce their sexuality 
as immoral 
gay youths may feel wicked and condemned to hell and 
attempt suicide in despair of ever obtaining redemption gibson 
wrote 
smith said the study contained antireligious sentiment and 
criticized it for calling homosexuality a natural and healthy 
expression of human sexuality 
the executive committee also was advised that the number of 
southern baptist missionaries is at an alltime high however 
officials said the churchs goal of 5000 missionaries by the year 
2000 will founder without more money 
records show 3827 missionaries are spreading gods message in 
the united states its territories and canada said larry l lewis 
president of the home mission board 
in no time in the history of our agency since its creation in 
1845 has god called out so many lewis said 
the nations largest protestant denomination has set a goal of 
having 5000 missionaries and 50000 churches by the year 2000 
the number of new churches grew by 1000 to 37567 in 1988 and 
the number of chaplains increased to 2014 
more new churches were constituted in any year since 1963 
lewis said more chaplains have been endorsed now than in any year 
in our history 
these advances were accomplished despite stringencies in budget 
and reductions in staff lewis said on a 96 percent cut in his 
boards upcoming budget as a result 26 positions have been 
eliminated at the boards headquarters in atlanta

appearing before lawmakers the defense 
minister denied charges that he did not act on information that 
mercenaries trained paramilitary death squads for colombias drug 
bosses 
during a heated debate in the senate on tuesday gen oscar 
botero restrepo said he was aware of rumors that israeli and british 
mercenaries were training paramilitary forces but was unable to 
verify the information 
the british ambassador said the colombian government knew about 
british mercenaries as early as march but did not mention botero 
the special senate session came after arrest warrants were issued 
monday for two israelis former army col yair klein and civilian 
arik acek accused of training hit squads for drug lords 
israel has concluded an investigation into the case and the 
supreme court there has to decide what if any action to take 
israel and colombia do not have an extradition treaty 
klein and acek are accused in colombia of helping train civilians 
to carry out paramilitary operations mostly in the magdalena media 
region of central colombia where drugbacked death squads are said 
to operate 
they reportedly arrived in colombia in august 1988 and are said 
to have returned to israel sometime after the colombian media 
reported on april 10 that foreign mercenaries were training 
colombians 
klein now home in tel aviv has said he trained colombian 
farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas and knew 
nothing about any links to drugs traffickers 
i want to tell you honorable senators that since late last 
year our intelligence services had knowledge of rumors circulating 
in the country that this type of activity was going on botero 
said but we were not able to verify the information 
on tuesday night british ambassador richard neilson told 
colombian television the government of colombia had information 
about british mercenaries in colombia in march and we were in a 
position to help them the government 
neilson said he would work to extradite to colombia the british 
citizens allegedly involved 
sen alberto rojas puyo of the opposition leftist patriotic union 
party is leading the attack on botero 
the party alleged on april 24 that botero was involved with atlas 
security a colombian company and claimed klein was employed by it 
botero who commands the countrys 250000man army has denied 
the allegation 
rojas told the senate the history of colombia will change 
because the conscience of colombians now dictates we reevaluate the 
conduct of our institutions 
he said the turning point came aug 16 when sen luis carlos 
galan the nations leading presidential candidate and outspoken 
drug foe was assassinated drugbacked terrorists have been blamed 
for the killing 
we colombians were all to blame for his death because we turned 
our backs to reality and allowed the country to fall under the 
tragedy of corruption rojas said 
the government began its crackdown on cocaine traffickers after 
the murder president virgilio barco revived colombias extradition 
treaty with the united states where the top cocaine lords are 
wanted on drug charges so far one trafficker has been extradited 
and proceedings are under away against two others 
the traffickers have retaliated with bombings shootings and 
arson 
the debate on mercenaries began last week after gen miguel maza 
marquez head of the countrys administrative security department 
similar to the fbi renewed allegations that foreigners were 
training death squads 
senators also asked botero on tuesday about the security provided 
to galan as he was to give a speech in soacha a town on the 
outskirts of the capital of bogota before being killed 
botero said 65 police 15 undercover security agents and galans 
own bodyguards were around the podium before galan was shot to death

jewish groups welcomed the vaticans decision to 
move a convent from the site of the auschwitz death camp but one 
group pressed for a timetable 
the elie wiesel foundation for humanity issued a statement by 
wiesel that thanked the vatican but added what is missing is a 
deadline many of us hope that the vatican in another statement will 
offer a timetable 
one deadline for the convents removal already has passed 
the vaticans decision was announced tuesday by its commission 
for religious relations with judaism 
its time to move on and implement the agreement said 
executive director elan steinberg of the world jewish congress 
steinberg said the vaticans decision would improve 
catholicjewish relations which had been severely strained over the 
polish convent and had also divided catholic cardinals in a highly 
unusual public split 
we welcome this very important step in restoring the good word 
of the church he said in a statement 
jewish groups have said they were offended by the presence of the 
convent and a 23foot cross at the auschwitzbirkenau site where an 
estimated 25 million jews were among 4 million people killed at the 
auschwitz concentration camp 
wiesel said that while he was gratified to know that there are 
catholics who try to understand our sensitivity and who speak out 
to help others understand as well he was saddened by the 
antisemitic remarks made by cardinal jozef glemp the polish 
primate 
speaking in bristol england glemp said removal of nuns was a 
scandal but in its first public declaration on the controversy 
the vatican diplomatically but firmly rejected the position held by 
glemp 
the offer by the roman catholic churchs heirarchy included 
helping to pay build a new prayer center outside the camp 
glemp said the convent may be moved but the jewish protests had 
touched the dignity of the nuns serving there 
he said building a prayer center away from the death camp would 
be a great step we hope in order to solve this problem 
in february 1987 jewish and catholic representatives agreed in 
geneva to move the carmelite nuns from the convent at the edge of 
the camp site 
the nuns were to be moved in february but the deadline passed 
and no prayer center was erected on aug 10 the archbishop of 
krakow cardinal franciszek macharski announced he was suspending 
the agreement because jewish protesters had created an atmosphere 
of aggressive demands 
glemp fueled the controversy by saying the accord should be 
renegotiated and that the polish church lacked money to build a 
prayer center

the moscow news today said that an article in the 
communist party daily that accused political maverick boris n 
yeltsin of boorish behavior on a us tour was a joke in poor 
taste 
the feisty weekly in an unusual slap at pravda dismissed 
yeltsins alleged drinking and shopping spree as irrelevant and 
criticized the soviet press for ignoring most of what yeltsin said 
on his us lecture tour 
on the morning of his return to moscow monday pravda reprinted a 
scathing article that appeared in the italian daily la repubblica 
depicting yeltsin as leaving behind a wake of catastrophic 
prophecies insane expenses interviews and above all the perfume of 
jack daniels black label whiskey 
yeltsin called the article garbage and accused pravda of 
seeking revenge for the fact that americans received us with 
admiration 
organizers of yeltsins tour and reporters who covered it said 
the 58yearold opposition legislator who became a hero to many 
soviets by criticizing special privileges for party and government 
officials did not appear drunk during his speeches and interviews 
in its editorial written by deputy chief editor vitaly 
tretyakov moscow news did not challenge the accuracy of the la 
repubblica account but said pravda failed to tell its readers 
whether the report was reliable 
moscow news which is published in english and has a limited 
circulation has been at the forefront of newspapers that are 
promoting perestroika president mikhail s gorbachevs economic 
reform program 
its difficult to take the article from la repubblica as 
anything but a joke in poor taste moscow news said 
as it appeared in pravda the article described the tour as a 
holiday a stage a bar 5000 kilometers long and said yeltsin was 
downing two bottles of vodka and four bottles of scotch daily 
yeltsin was delivering lectures gave seven interviews every 
day and talked with the us president for 15 minutes but in the 
soviet press only a few short articles appeared moscow news said 
noting that the soviet press practically never tells readers 
which of their leaders drink or about their shopping habits abroad 
the editorial said 
about yeltsin we now know pity that such a leap forward in 
the sphere of glasnost was made by the soviet press not on its own 
but with the help of italian newspapers 
moscow news said yeltsin should be seen as a political leader and 
what he may have drunk or bought in the united states was not 
important 
during his ninecity tour yeltsin said gorbachev could face a 
revolution if he fails to improve living conditions soon 
yeltsin the former communist party chief of moscow was stripped 
of the job almost two years ago by gorbachev who criticized him as 
politically immature and overly ambitious 
but in a remarkable political comeback the populist won 89 
percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidate 
to represent moscow in the congress of peoples deputies 
a month and a half ago he was elected along with nobel peace 
prize laureate andrei d sakahrov and a handful of other reformers 
to the steering committee of the first organized opposition in the 
soviet parliament in almost 70 years

dian fosseys fight to save africas 
mountain gorilla from extinction will be continued by a 33yearold 
new york woman 
diane doran a researcher at the state university of new york at 
stony brook was chosen from 15 applicants to be the next director 
of the karisoke research center in rwanda 
fossey who was portrayed in the movie gorillas in the mist 
set up the center 1967 to study and preserve the mountain gorilla 
she was slain in her mountain hut in 1985 two others have served 
twoyear stints as directors since then 
i consider it a privilege said doran being able to study 
animals in the wild is magical something very few people will 
ever get to do 
the digit fund an animal conservation organization in engelwood 
colo that finances the center chose doran in june the fund is 
named after one of fosseys favorite gorillas 
a native of whitesboro in upstate new york near utica doran is 
completing her doctoral thesis comparing pygmied and common 
chimpanzees she has worked in africa and is fluent in lingala an 
african language 
at the center doran will supervise research on the mountain 
gorilla assist in conservation efforts and oversee an antipoaching 
program she will live alone in a cabin high in the mountains on the 
border between rwanda and zaire 
fossey who studied the mountain gorilla for 20 years set up 
antipoaching patrols to protect the threatened species of which 
about 300 remain she became an enemy to poachers who slaughtered 
the gorillas and sold their heads and hands to be made into ashtrays 
and other souvenirs 
doran said she never met fossey but admired her pioneering work 
when she went there it was unheard of for a woman or anybody to 
study great apes said doran 
she said she doesnt fear for her safety because the rwandans 
have become supportive of conservation tourists who want to see the 
gorillas are the countrys thirdlargest source of revenue

our goal is a new south africa a totally changed south africa a 
south africa which has rid itself of the antagonisms of the past a 
south africa free of domination or oppression in whatever form a 
south africa within which the democratic forces all reasonable 
people align themselves behind mutually acceptable goals and 
against radicalism 
we accept that time is of the essence and we are committed to 
visible evolutionary progress while we are quite prepared to be 
tested against our undertakings we cannot accept responsibility for 
overenthusiastic or even twisted versions of our policy 
for years progress was hampered by among others lack of 
cooperation suspicion and mistrust and as critics of the 
government would surely want to allege also by actions andor 
failures on the side of the government 
the time has come for south africa to restore its pride and to 
lift itself out of the doldrums of growing international isolation 
economic decline and increasing polarization 
during the term of the new government we shall concentrate 
especially on five crucial areas 
we shall set everything in motion to bridge the deep gulf of 
mistrust suspicion and fear between south africans 
the negotiation process will from the start receive incisive 
attention 
we are going to open the door to prosperity and economic growth 
we shall do this by breaking out of the international stranglehold 
which for political reasons has been applied to our growth 
potential 
we are going to develop a new constitutional dispensation in 
which everyone will be able to participate without domination 
we shall continue to deal with unrest violence and terrorism 
with a firm hand 
we shall work urgently on proposals with regard to the handling 
of discriminatory legislation the continued removal of 
discrimination remains an important objective 
we shall work just as urgently on the formulation of alternative 
methods of protecting group and minority rights in a 
nondiscriminatory manner this includes urgent attention to the

fw de klerk was sworn in as 
president today and appealed to south africans of all races to help 
build a nation free of domination and oppression 
he took the oath of office at a pretoria church as reports spread 
that his government would free jailed black nationalist leader 
nelson mandela next year newspapers quoted officials as saying the 
release would be part of several moves aimed at drawing blacks into 
negotiations on a new constitution 
our goal is a new south africa a totally changed south africa 
a south africa which has rid itself of the antagonisms of the past 
a south africa free of domination or oppression in whatever form 
de klerk 53 said during the swearingin ceremony 
a leading antiapartheid activist the rev allan boesak said he 
would give de klerk six months to prove that blacks skepticism 
toward him is unfounded 
if he does not move by then our fears will be tragically 
fulfilled said boesak president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches if he does move then i think we might find 
ourselves in a situation where one may begin to be hopeful 
de klerk said his government would move to eliminate 
discriminatory laws give urgent attention to adopting a bill of 
rights and release prisoners such as mandela if that would promote 
peaceful solutions 
he said he hoped to gradually move away from the 3yearold 
state of emergency which has severed restricted militant 
antiapartheid activity 
protest regarding past injustice or alleged injustice does 
not bring us closer to a solution nor does unrest or violence he 
said there is but one way to peace to justice for all that is 
the way of reconciliation 
he reiterated his vision of a new political system in which the 
nowvoteless black majority would be able to participate without 
dominating the white minority and he cautioned against unreasonable 
expectations for his program 
de klerks eyes watered when a minister preaching at the 
swearingin ceremony urged him to press forward without fear chief 
justice michael corbett administered the oath of office before about 
1500 people in a dutch reformed church near the university of 
pretoria 
in an indication of south africas international isolation no 
foreign heads of state were present 
as the ceremony began a group of human rights lawyers in 
pretoria announced that de klerk had commuted the death sentences of 
seven prisoners on death row 
it was the second time in five weeks that de klerk took the oath 
he became acting president on aug 15 a day after the cabinet 
forced president pw botha to resign after his 11 years in power 
de klerk did not mention mandela by name in his speech but said 
security prisoners would be released if public order was not 
threatened and prospects for peace could be enhanced 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence 
along with other leaders of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement for plotting antigovernment sabotage 
since succeeding botha de klerk has repeatedly stressed the need 
for speedy reform and has called white domination of the black 
majority unfair 
his national party lost seats to both the left and right in 
elections sept 6 but retained its parliamentary majority on a 
platform calling for a vote for blacks on the national level by 1994 
although he has spoken out against discrimination de klerk 
opposes outright black majority rule and favors segregated 
neighborhoods and schools for whites who want them 
his personal style conciliatory and affable translated into 
immediate political gain when he declared that police would no 
longer interfere with peaceful antigovernment protests 
last week tens of thousands of people of all races participated 
in two of the largest marches in south african history 
some of his staunchest black opponents praised de klerks 
decision seen as an attempt to defuse bitterness and encourage 
black leaders to negotiate with the government 
but under the state of emergency which grants police almost 
unlimited powers to limit freedom of speech press and assembly 
police continued to detain black leaders without charge while the 
marches went on 
throughout his 17 years in politics including 10 years in the 
cabinet de klerk has been a lowkey loyal supporter of the 
national party and a policy of gradual limited reforms 
de klerk practiced law before entering parliament in 1973 from 
1978 he held a series of cabinet posts and in 1982 took on the 
powerful job of national party leader in transvaal south africas 
most populous and wealthy province 
de klerk and his marike wife have three children

engine inspections and design modifications are 
being ordered for the dc10 following an iowa crash that killed 112 
people but top aviation and safety officials still say the 
widebody jetliner is safe 
a congressional transportation subcommittee summoned the heads of 
the federal aviation administration the national transportation 
safety board and a mcdonnell douglas vice president tuesday to 
discuss the troubleplagued airliner 
all said dc10s are safe as safe as any other widebody jet 
and there is no reason to ground the more than 400 in service 
within hours after the hearing there was another incident 
involving a dc10 the french airline uta said a bomb most likely 
caused the crash of one of its dc10s carrying 171 people from 
ndjamena chad to paris the scattered wreckage was found in 
southcentral niger and there was no word on survivors 
faa administrator james b busey announced to the senate 
commerce science and transportation subcommittee an order to 
inspect the fan disks of 220 dc10 engines similar to the one 
investigators believe failed prior to the july 19 crash of a united 
dc10 in sioux city iowa that killed 112 people 
james kolstad safety board chairman told the same hearing that 
a dc10 modification recommended by aircraft builder mcdonnell 
douglas last week should be made mandatory for all of the jetliners 
the manufacturer said the change would prevent the loss of all 
hydraulic flight controls which occurred before the july 19 united 
flight 232 crash in iowa 
kolstad said dc10s and other widebody airliners are among the 
safest airplanes in history 
the subcommittee chairman sen wendell h ford dky said the 
hearing was called to get reassurances that the government is 
adequately policing safety of the dc10 
busey described several government and industry groups set up to 
look into possible improvements for the dc10 and other airliners 
at the outset i believe it is important that i assure you and 
the public that the faa considers the dc10 to be a safe aircraft 
the administrator said adding that there was no reason to ground 
the airliner 
busey said that although investigators had not determined what 
caused the explosive engine failure in the iowa crash one possible 
scenario is the development of a crack in the engine fan disk as 
the result of an internal flaw in the disk material itself 
inspections ordered by the faa cover all general electric cf66 
engines built for the dc10 using a doublevacuum melt process 
during the formation of titanium material from which the rotor disks 
are forged 
the inspection order is needed to identify and remove from 
service stage 1 fan disks which may have metallurgical 
imperfections such imperfections can adversely affect the service 
life of the disk the faa said 
faa officials earlier said a microscopic flaw was found in 
analysis of six engines built from the same metal used in the iowa 
dc10 
busey said 55 engines would be inspected by nov 21 and the 
remaining 165 before february 4 
sen ernest f hollings dsc questioned the timetable 
calling for the faa to say what is being done to minimize the 
risks that those aircraft in operation pose until they clear faa 
inspections 
kolstad said the safety boards investigations into dc10 
accidents to date have uncovered no common thread that would 
suggest a fundamental design flaw of the airplane 
he said there is nothing to indicate that the dc10s operating 
history is significantly different from that of other widebody 
transport airplanes 
while in retrospect all of these airplanes may have benefited 
from some design improvements their operating records have placed 
them among the safest airplanes in history he said

organizers of underground tests of an aids 
drug derived from chinese cucumber roots say early results show 
promise but also dangers 
you cant use the word dramatic to describe the results of such 
a preliminary early study but you can say it had a significant 
effect martin delaney codirector of project inform said 
tuesday 
the san franciscobased aids information group secretly organized 
the study of the drug compound q in may without authorization from 
the food and drug administration project inform has said that 
desperate aids patients already were experimenting on themselves 
with the drug and wouldnt wait for government action 
more than 300 people crowded into the room where delaney 
announced results of the study of 34 patients from san francisco and 
new york tests results have not yet been tabulated for those taking 
part in los angeles and miami 
two patients died after receiving compound q and three others 
suffered severe dementia or seizures but recovered all already had 
severely disabled immune systems and doctors did not blame the 
deaths on compound q delaney said 
this drug has serious risks associated with it but its too 
important to be dismissed said delaney who called for 
accelerated federal research 
the promising effects in some patients treated with compound q 
included slight rises in t4 lymphocyte cells which are crucial for 
a healthy immune system others showed drops in levels of p24 
antigen a protein the human immunodeficiency virus which causes 
aids is thought to release as it reproduces in cells 
delaney and the san francisco doctors who designed the study 
alan levin and larry waites said the results indicate the compound 
could be valuable in combination with other drugs such as azt 
these numbers are a little squishy levin said but if you 
get four squishy numbers and theyre all pointing in the same 
direction you know youre on to something 
project inform initiated its study after university of 
californiasan francisco researcher dr michael mcgrath reported 
that compound q appeared to selectively kill cells infected with the 
virus in test tube studies

house speaker thomas foley said today the house 
would consider an ethics reform package this fall but took no 
position on a task forces tentative plan to raise congressional pay 
35 percent over two years 
foley said the task force has not presented the house leadership 
with its preliminary recommendation which a congressional source 
said also includes a proposal to phase out controversial honoraria 
payments 
weve made no decision on that foley told reporters well 
listen to whatever recommendations are made 
all recent attempts to reform house ethics rules have included a 
pay increase along with reform of the honoraria system 
asked if the house would still consider an ethics reform package 
this year foley said i think we will consider an ethics package 
this fall 
the proposal would increase pay by about 10 percent next year 
another 25 percent in 1991 and tie pay boosts afterward to the cost 
of living the source said tuesday night speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the final recommendation of the 10member bipartisan task force 
is expected to be presented to congressional leadership this week 
the proposal is subject to change and is expected to go before the 
full house by the end of october 
house and senate members currently are paid 89500 annually and 
leaders are paid more a 35 percent increase would make the salary 
120825 
a key part of the new plan would be a twoyear phaseout of 
honoraria fees for making speeches often to organizations 
lobbying for legislation house members now may keep honoraria 
totaling 30 percent of their pay while the limit for senators is 40 
percent 
the proposal also would eliminate a provision in current law 
allowing house members who were in office by january 1980 to convert 
excess campaign money to personal use the task force has not 
decided when that proposed change should take effect according to 
the source 
the plan also would tighten disclosure requirements for receipt 
of gifts the task force reportedly is considering several proposals 
to allow outside earned income other than honoraria including the 
possibility of letting members keep 15 percent of their outside 
earnings 
former house speaker jim wright dtexas established the task 
force earlier this year after lawmakers suffered through their 
latest bitter feud over a pay increase 
consumer advocate ralph nader led what became a public outcry 
against a plan to raise lawmakers salaries by 51 percent a raise 
that could have gone into effect without a vote if congress had gone 
along with the recommendations of a presidential pay commission and 
former president reagan 
wright sought to save part of the raise by having the house vote 
on a 30 percent increase that would have been offset by a phaseout 
of honoraria but the house rejected such a plan 
congressional watchdog group common cause and other organizations 
have called repeatedly for an end to honoraria which usually is a 
2000 per appearance fee for lawmakers who are invited to speak to 
groups that have an interest in legislation 
critics say the fees too often amount to a reward just for 
showing up sometimes at conventions at plush resorts for which the 
members expenses are picked up by the sponsors 
backers of a raise say members have not taken cost of living 
increases in recent years and need a substantial increase to catch 
up with inflation many members feel they must maintain two homes 
one in washington and one in their home districts and face expenses 
that others with similar salaries dont have the supporters say 
the task force of 10 members is equally divided between the 
parties and chaired by reps vic fazio dcalif and lynn martin 
rill

more than 400 east german refugees 
arrived in west germany overnight a border officials said today 
some emigres said they swam the danube river to get to hungary and 
the open border to the west 
most of the new arrivals apparently made their way from 
czechoslovakia via hungary and austria 
several of the refugees interviewed by west german television 
said czechoslovakias communist authorities were trying to prevent 
east germans from reaching hungary even though the refugees had 
valid travel documents and visas for hungary 
some refugees told west german television in the border city of 
passau that they swam across the danube river to reach hungary 
one man said he was prevented from crossing to hungary went back 
to poland and then flew to budapest none of the interviewed 
refugees was identified 
a west german border police spokesman klaus papenfuss said 416 
east germans crossed the border into west germany overnight most in 
special buses 
hungarian media on tuesday confirmed previous reports by refugees 
and relief workers that czechoslovak authorities were trying to 
prevent east germans from reaching hungary 
hungary last week opened its borders to east german refugees and 
more than 17000 have since used the opportunity to emigrate to west 
germany 
newspaper reports said the number of east german refugees in the 
west german embassy in prague today swelled to at least 520 
in bonn foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said 16 of 
120 east germans who had taken refuge in the west german embassy in 
warsaw had been moved to a nearby roman catholic seminary 
the influx of refugees to the cramped embassy forced the west 
german government to close the mission to the public on tuesday the 
refugees are demanding free passage to west germany 
chrobog told reporters in bonn the seminary was made available by 
the warsaw diocese at the request of west germanys ambassador to 
poland franzjoachim schoeller 
schoeller told west german television late tuesday that poland 
has promised a pragmatic solution for the refugees 
the masscirculation newspaper bild said polands new government 
dominated by noncommunists and led by solidarity activist tadeusz 
mazowiecki had assured bonn that no east german refugees would be 
sent back against their will to their hardline communist homeland 
poland has a bilateral agreement obliging it to repatriate east 
german refugees to east germany but the new government in warsaw is 
committed to respecting the 1975 helsinki agreements guaranteeing 
freedom of movement bild said 
hungary had a similar bilateral agreement with east germany but 
suspended it on sept 10 and allowed thousands of east germans to 
cross austria and enter west germany where they receive automatic 
citizenship and help settling 
the dispute over the refugees is straining relations within the 
warsaw pact as well as between the two german states

haitian refugees trying to reach the united states 
in small boats have adopted a grim new tactic threatening to throw 
their babies into the sea unless the coast guard gets out of their 
way 
in the most recent incident 103 haitians aboard a rickety 
40foot sailboat in the bahamas turned seven of their infants into 
hostages saturday night to try to keep a 110foot coast guard cutter 
at bay said lt paul wolf 
when a larger 205foot cutter arrived sunday morning the 
refugees gave up and were returned to haiti said wolf a spokesman 
at the coast guards east coast operations center in boston 
it was the third time in seven months that people fleeing the 
depressed and strifetorn caribbean island have threatened their 
childrens lives in a desperate effort to reach florida the coast 
guard said 
both previous incidents on march 25 and june 1 also ended with 
the peaceful return of the refugees to haiti in no case was any 
infant tossed overboard 
but coast guard officials said they are concerned that the tactic 
is spreading and may eventually result in death or injury 
its a variation on a hostagetaking obviously a very delicate 
situation and the fact that youre on the open water makes it even 
more delicate said lt cmdr jeff karonis a coast guard 
spokesman in miami 
youre at the mercy of the weather all the time it can get 
dark you have to worry whether they have enough food and whether 
their vessel is going to sink it can get very hairy 
in all three incidents the coast guards response has been to 
open negotiations with the refugees try to calm them down and wait 
them out 
but there is no formal policy on how to handle the threats and

if its a nice calm day where the vessel is seaworthy theres

month before the coast guard interdiction program began in 1981 
said henry chomentowski an immigration and naturalization service

most of them submit passively said karonis but when they 
have been crowded in those boats for days and they think they have

a judge has ordered the immigration and 
naturalization service to partially reveal its secret list of barred 
aliens believed to number as many as 40000 and its reasons for 
keeping them out of the country 
us district judge john m walker issued the order tuesday in 
connection with a lawsuit demanding to know why patricia lara a 
colombian journalist was barred three years ago 
walker said the public had an interest in knowing the reasons the 
government gives for barring aliens 
however he said that while the barred aliens occupations and 
the reasons for their exclusion had to be revealed their names 
would not be made public 
some individuals could be placed in grave danger in their own 
countries if it were learned that the american government suspects 
them of being affiliated with terrorist organizations he said 
the list formally the national automated immigration lookout 
system also is called the lookout book 
walker exempted from disclosure documents involving national 
security said assistant us attorney chad a vignola 
the list probably will not be revealed until related documents 
have been examined for national security considerations said miss 
laras lawyer arthur c helton of the lawyers committee for 
international human rights 
she still wants to come to the united states and she is still 
vitally interested in learning what it was that kept her out 
helton said 
miss lara 35 a 1980 graduate of the columbia university 
graduate school of journalism was working on a freelance basis for 
el tiempo a bogota newspaper when she came to new york in 1986 as 
a winner of a maria moors cabot prize the prizes are awarded for 
advancing interamerican understanding and freedom of information 
she was detained at kennedy airport her visa was revoked and she 
was sent back to colombia without a hearing 
an immigration regional commissioner michael d mosbacher said 
miss lara came under sections of the law dealing with people the ins 
believed were likely to engage in subversive activities or whose 
presence would be prejudicial to public interest or endanger 
security 
the lawyers committee sought the reasons for barring her but 
the government produced only a few documents the committee then 
sued the fbi cia state department and ins 
miss lara reportedly was linked to a colombian terrorist group 
she maintained she was barred for writing articles critical of 
american policy in central america 
she married colombias attorney general alfonso gomez mendez in 
april

communist hardliners supported president mikhail 
s gorbachevs warning about anarchy and ethnic separatism by 
calling for a crackdown on groups seeking more freedom from moscow 
reports said today 
but leaders of lithuania and georgia two republics where ethnic 
issues are causing the kremlin headaches blamed their problems on 
processes taking place nationwide or on outside provocation intended 
to cause a crackdown 
absamat masaliev communist party chief of the central asian 
republic of kirghizia told a meeting of the partys policymaking 
central committee that the time has come to bring to order 
those who openly speak out against our structure our unity 
sabotage perestroika and abuse democracy 
masaliev said that calls to turn the party into a union of 
independent groups or to introduce a multiparty system were an 
extremely dangerous and destructive tendency 
his comments and those of other party leaders were made tuesday 
and distributed today by tass the official soviet news agency the 
central committee continued its work today and tass said it debated 
a blueprint for ethnic relations offered by gorbachev as part of his 
reform drive 
the president opened the meeting tuesday by offering the 15 
soviet republics more power to decide economic issues but he said 
the kremlin would not tolerate anarchy or what he called separatist 
demagogues ethnic disputes have become one of the most complex and 
serious problems in this land of more than 100 nationalities during 
the period of gorbachevs reforms 
they have resulted in more than 200 deaths in the past 18 months 
the virtual blockade of one republic and calls for independence from 
moscow 
in april 20 people were killed by soldiers during a nationalist 
protest in georgia and activists said the violent crackdown was 
ordered by moscow 
the georgian communist party chief givi gumbaridze claimed 
today that excesses on nationalist grounds often are orchestrated 
by outsiders forcing authorities to impose curfews and special 
forms of administration 
he did not identify the outsiders 
gorbachev urged soviets not give in to demagogues with 
slogans served under the pleasant sauce of independence 
secession etc 
he recounted how the kremlin has tried to bring peace to the 
caucasus mountain republics of armenia and azerbaijan where soviet 
officials say the current situation is more tense than at any time 
during an 18month standoff over control of the nagornokarabakh 
region 
the kremlin has imposed direct rule on the region to no avail 
and gorbachev said the party was contemplating resolute measures 
to quell the violence 
addressing demands in latvia lithuania and estonia to recognize 
that they were forcibly absorbed by dictator josef stalin as world 
war ii broke out gorbachev said stalins policy was wrong but that 
the baltic republics joined the soviet union voluntarily rather than 
face adolf hitlers nazi forces alone 
algirdas brazauskas the lithuanian party chief said today that 
lithuania does not intend to try to leave the soviet union but he 
defended his republic by saying the transformation taking place in 
the entire country under gorbachevs reforms is simply moving ahead 
faster in lithuania 
yuri yelchenko a secretary of the ukrainian communist party 
said a series of independent formations have clear antisocialist 
platforms the basis of which often lies in bourgeois nationalism 
he said such groups were especially active in the western 
ukraine and he accused the narodni rukh grassroots political 
movement of seeking to seize power from the communists 
local party leaders said they support plans to give them more 
control over their economies they complained that since many of the 
factories and offices in their republics now are under the control 
of national ministries in moscow they pay little in the way of 
local taxes 
in its first decision tuesday the central committee backed 
gorbachevs proposal to hold the next party congress ahead of 
schedule in october 1990 the sessions are held every five years 
and the last one opened on feb 24 1986 
a congress gives gorbachev the broadest possible opportunity to 
remake the party leadership it is theoretically the most powerful 
party body responsible for broad policy outlinesa as well as 
electing the central committee since the 1986 congress gorbachev 
has been able to demote committee members or promote others and 
only such a session can give him an entirely new central committee

a teenager pleaded guilty to holding 11 
classmates hostage at gunpoint for up to 10 hours then got his 
demand to see his father for the first time in 13 years 
dustin pierce 17 had said during the siege monday at jackson 
county high school that he was angry with his distant father and 
wanted to see him the boy who had stormed the school with a 
shotgun and two pistols surrendered after firing two shots 
theres a lot that has been resolved theres also a lot that 
needs to be resolved weve got 13 years here to get caught up on 
the father donald pierce of delray beach fla said tuesday 
we talked he said there was a lot of misunderstanding a 
lot of 
his voice trailed off and pierce dropped his head in his hands 
and cried 
the younger pierce on tuesday pleaded guilty to 26 counts of 
kidnapping and wanton endangerment at a juvenile hearing hours 
later he met with his mother and father whom he hadnt seen since 
he was 4 at a state police post detective robert stephens said 
when we were negotiating we agreed that this meeting would 
take place stephens said we agreed with them we would not talk 
about what they said and we are not going to 
the family later emphasized that dustin didnt want to hurt 
anyone during the standoff 
he just wanted to see his dad said his mother carol pierce 
clay county attorney clay m bishop jr said he decided to 
prosecute pierce as a juvenile that means the boy who turns 18 in 
july probably will spend less than a year in custody if tried as 
an adult he could have received 325 years in prison 
i think what youve got is just a scared mixedup little 
kid the prosecutor said he didnt appear to us to be a 
criminal were just trying to do whats best for him

worldcivilization class at the 500student school in the rolling 
appalachian foothills no one was injured 
he was real nice he didnt want to hurt anybody said brian 
bond 17 one of the hostages and a close friend 
the boy apparently was acting out the scenario of a stephen king 
novel rage in which a youth takes over a classroom in pursuit 
of what the author describes as a pathological rage fantasy about 
his father 
king who lives in bangor maine said he believed that pierce 
was acting out rage even before it was reported that police had 
found the novel in the boys home but he denied that the book was 
to blame for the incident 
if they didnt do it one way they would do it another way 
he told the bangor daily news crazy is crazy

in bankruptcy cases should the county decide to declare insolvency

the governments final report on a delta airline 
disaster that killed 14 people found that the crew didnt set the 
flaps for takeoff but still might have averted the crash if it had 
followed emergency procedures a newspaper reported today 
the national transportation safety board report on the crash last 
year at dallasfort worth international airport put the blame on 
delta air lines the flight crew and the federal aviation 
administration according to the dallas times herald which said it 
obtained a copy of the report 
the boeing 727 bound for salt lake city crashed on takeoff aug 
31 1988 fourteen of the 108 people aboard were killed 
the 174page report will be formally presented to the ntsb for 
approval on tuesday although the ntsb can alter the report it 
usually makes few changes in its staff reports 
the report concludes that the crews failure to follow preflight 
checklist procedures and complacent cockpit behavior led to its 
neglecting to set the wing flaps which provide lift for takeoff 
the times herald reported 
deltas management policies with respect to crew guidance and 
training were deficient and directly causal to this accident the 
report says 
it also also accuses the faa of contributing to the accident by 
failing to correct known deficiencies in delta operations 
earlier this year delta said an internal investigation showed 
the crew had caused the crash by failing to set the flaps the 
atlantabased carrier accepted responsibility for the accident and 
fired three crew members 
jackie pate an atlantabased delta representative tuesday night 
would not comment on the report neither would the captain larry 
lon davis 
at an october 1988 ntsb hearing crew members said they performed 
their jobs properly although none could specifically remember 
moving the flap handle or checking the flap gauges 
a cockpit recording which indicates the crew and a flight 
attendant talked about nonbusiness topics in violation of federal 
rules clearly indicated a relaxed almost complacent attitude in 
the cockpit of flight 1141 the report says 
the tape indicated that at the point where the copilot 
customarily lowered the flaps he was interrupted by ground 
controllers and later conversations with the captain and a flight 
attendant 
the flight attendants lengthy presence in the cockpit possibly 
contributed to the flight crews failure to visually check the 
flap gauges the report says 
had davis exercised his responsiblity and asked the attendant 
to leave the flap position discrepancy might have been 
discovered it says 
the report also says the accident may not have been 
inevitable it says the accident might have been avoided had davis 
advanced the throttles to full power and lowered the nose of the 
plane shortly after encountering trouble 
a few months after the crash delta tightened its preflight 
checklist procedures and began new training methods 
the report recommends that the faa ensure that the roles of 
flight crew members be clearly delineated in all carriers 
operations manuals 
it also recommends that the agency require that verifying the 
flap position and proper procedures to save a faltering airplane be 
included in manuals

prime minister lynden pindling cut short 
an official visit to jamaica and returned to the bahamas today 
because of hurricane hugo but it appeared the killer storm would 
spare the islands a direct hit 
tropical storm warnings were posted for the central and 
northeastern islands however light winds and scattered clouds 
greeted morning commuters in nassau 
the center of hugo was well to the east in the open atlantic 
and was on a course that would carry it safely past the northernmost 
bahamas 
late tuesday when hugo appeared more threatening shoppers and 
tourists from the bustling cruise ship trade clogged the citys 
downtown displaying only modest concern that hugos 105 mph winds 
were blowing a few hundred miles offshore 
the government issued no emergency instructions no emergency 
shelters were set up and there was no sense of urgent storm 
preparation 
pindling left the bahamas on monday for a commonwealth finance 
ministers meeting in kingston jamaica he was to head to washington 
at weeks end 
forecasters today said that if hugo maintained course it would 
continue moving parallel to the bahamas bringing high winds and 
rains to the islands but not the death and destruction seen in other 
parts of the eastern caribbean 
officials at the bahamas meteorological department in nassau said 
late tuesday however there was cause for concern 
its not enough to deliver a devastating blow said 
meteorolgist nicholas small but its not far enough away for us 
to relax were going to get a healthy tropical wind ranging between 
39 and 73 mph and possibly higher in gusts 
the government has begun some preparations a work crew began 
boarding up windows of government buildings reuben henderson 
nailing plywood sheets over windows on a government office building 
said he and his crew had been given those instructions 
dorothea seymour a shopkeeper in the busy downtown straw market 
didnt seem too concerned 
some people care some people dont she said were always 
hearing about storms but they never come 
with her business 15 feet from nassau harbour ms seymour said 
if the storm came she would simply pack up her stock of straw 
handbags dolls hats and tshirts 
four cruise ships were tied up at prince george wharf just yards 
away their passengers browsing through shops about the city 
we have not had any cancellations of cruise ships said 
cordell thompson a spokesman for the ministry of tourism and 
there have been no cancellations of air service 
thompson said he didnt think the bahamas could avoid hugos 
effects altogether 
i suspect were going to get a lot of rain and a lot of high 
winds he said 
if the hurricane made a sharp turn to the northwest or the west 
toward the bahamas we might start getting nervous thompson 
said 
few vacationers appeared worried about facing a hurricane on new 
providence the bahamas most populous island 
michael belt and his wife rachelle of henderson ky were 
among them 
i guess all the people here have to ride it out and i guess 
ill have to ride it out with them belt said 
i think well make it through said mrs belt

while the house ethics committee probes his acknowledged involvement 
with a male prostitute 
frank the massachusetts democrat who asked for the ethics 
inquiry following the charges against him by stephen l gobie also 
disputed suggestions that congressional and democratic party leaders 
have urged him to resign 
i havent been asked by anybody to resign frank told 
reporters today 
he repeated his intention to remain in office and await an 
inquiry by the house ethics committee 
i think that resignation would be a great mistake he said 
it would cut off the ethics committee process and i think that 
would be a cowardly and inappropriate way to proceed 
frank termed an inaccurate accusation remarks by rep robert 
michel of illinois the house republican leader who on tuesday said 
the frank case was becoming a stain upon the house of 
representatives and suggested frank was benefiting from a double 
standard 
if it were anyone other than barney frank if i were to have 
a woman prostitute in my employ for my own selfgratification id 
be run out of town michel told a news conference 
frank responded i think itd be a great mistake for anyone to 
suggest that the ethics committee is somehow going to be 
administering a double standard i dont see that at all 
with frank under republican attack homosexual activists say the 
controversy over his personal life raises a debate on whether to 
respect the privacy of politicians who are secretly homosexual but 
publicly appear antigay 
its not a new debate but with the whole barney frank thing 
people are focusing in on it said don michaels publisher of the 
washington blade the citys homosexually oriented newspaper 
the washington times today quoted anonymous congressional 
democrats who said the party leadership was working on a way to get 
frank to resign 
they are trying to figure out a way to do it to get the word 
to barney said a congressman the times identified only as a 
liberal democrat from a western state the death drums are 
pounding and he must go 
frank a liberal who disclosed his homosexuality in 1987 has 
come under scrutiny since acknowledging his relationship with a male 
prostitute stephen gobie 
frank paid gobie for sex in 1985 and then hired him as a personal 
assistant gobie contends he provided prostitution services from 
franks capitol hill home and frank knew about it but frank has 
denied having any such knowledge 
the congressman has asked the house ethics committee to review 
his case and will await the panels decision before deciding his 
political future 
ronald brown chairman of the democratic national committee said 
the ethics committees investigation should go forward but he 
conceded that pressure is building for franks resignation the 
boston globe franks hometown paper and long his editorial 
supporter has called for him to resign 
homosexual activists meantime said frank should not quit i 
hope he doesnt resign its up to the voters said robert 
bauman a former republican congressman from maryland who was 
defeated after revelations that he engaged in homosexual sex with a 
juvenile 
kevin berrill a spokesman for the national gay amp lesbian task 
force said he was angry about gop attacks on frank i am 
disturbed by a pattern of incidents that are emerging from the 
republicans he said 
besides attacks on frank berrill cited a memo that originated 
earlier this year from the republican national committee implying 
that house speaker thomas s foley dwash was a homosexual rnc 
chairman lee atwater disavowed the memo and the staffer who wrote 
the memo resigned 
one of those upset by the foley episode was frank who at the 
time threatened to reveal the names of republican congressmen he 
said he knew were homosexual 
homosexuals said anger in the gay community over the frank affair 
has spurred the debate over whether to expose homosexual politicians 
who fail to support gay rights 
i can understand people getting so angry fighting bigots who 
practice what they rail against said michaels the newspaper 
publisher who has been openly homosexual since the 1960s 
he said he opposed bringing anyone out of the closet against 
their will but he would publish the name of a homosexual 
politician who actively worked at odds with gay movement 
objectives the blade would have to have incontrovertible 
proof the person was homosexual such as a sworn statement from a 
partner before a name was published he said 
its a complex issue said eric rosenthal political director 
of the human rights campaign fund generally questions of sexual 
orientation are private they dont have a bearing on how 
politicians do their job 
but rosenthal said hypocrisy having a homosexual life while 
seeming to be antigay is an important part of character one 
should make an issue of that 
he drew an analogy between a politician who actively worked 
against the south african regime because of its racial policies 
while at the same time holding financial interests in the 
whiteruled nation thats hypocritical he said

delaware county daily times primos pa on the homeless 
while estimates on the current number of homeless people range 
between 655000 to 4 million congress has found a possible answer 
spend as little money as possible and let as many people as 
possible try to find as many cures as possible 
this is impossible 
as proof we have seen the federal government slash 25 billion 
from housing programs since 1981 while cities and states conduct 
halfhearted uncoordinated and underfinanced efforts to combat the 
homeless problem 
nothing has worked because the number of homeless is growing 20 
to 40 percent each year 
the main federal program the stewart mckinney homeless 
assistance act empowers the government to spend up to 3 billion 
over five years for programs for the homeless yet since the 
legislation was enacted in 1987 congress has only provided 11 
billion in funding 
whats the deal 
state and local governments which are left in a precarious 
position scrambling to fill the funding gaps are reluctant to do 
much hoping that the federal government will step back in and take 
charge 
no such luck 
we see homelessness as a national problem something that must be 
coordinated properly from the top allocating a few bucks and 
considering the matter resolved doesnt cut it

the flint mich journal on the importance of the us 
constitution 
most of the nations selfproclaimed patriots must have been too 
consumed with wrapping themselves in the flag or with handwringing 
over proposed flagburning legislation to have noticed the 202nd 
anniversary of the signing of us constitution sunday 
thats too bad because it is our constitution more than our 
flag that is really the premier icon of us freedom and governance 
we celebrate with great gusto as we should our declaration of 
independence and to a lesser degree flag day but it is our 
precious constitution the oldest written constitution continuously 
in force that we should especially celebrate and respect more 
than a symbol to ourselves and the rest of the world this document 
is a specific declaration of who we are and what we stand for 
sadly while many americans claim pride in our constitution 
survey after survey reveals appalling public ignorance about what it 
says and means 
perhaps our nation should spend less time arguing about the flag 
and spend more time reading or rereading this fourpage 5000word 
document that gives our flag meat and meaning why not turn off the 
tube and start tonight

the seattle times on the evacuation of the us embassy in beirut 
thirty years of us diplomatic presence in lebanon ended this 
month with the evacuation of the american embassy in beirut 
for beirut the epicenter of sectarian violence the chaos of 
1989 is just another moment in 3500 years of destruction at the 
hands of religious enemies and foreign invaders 
since 1975 beirut has been selfdestructing in bloody fits and 
starts of civil war and sectarian vengeance christan and moslem 
forces are now locked in a final frenzy of destruction the battles 
are over the corpse of a once celebrated center of trade learning 
and cosmopolitan sophistication 
beiruts demise affirms an eternal verity religion and 
government do not mix intolerance poisons secular affairs 
us presidents and their diplomatic envoys hardly cut and ran 
from lebanon they endured bombings assassinations hostages and 
vicious shellings but the hatreds were too old and too 
misunderstood for uncle sam to prevail 
beirut is dead but it may flourish again renewal like 
destruction is part of the citys history

kennebec journal augusta maine on the alaska oil spill 
so what do we learn from this disaster 
primarily that prevention is a lot better than attempted cure 
once the oil is out of the tanker its too late quick response to 
the accident totally lacking in prince william sound would have 
helped but even that isnt a sure thing a smaller oil spill off 
rhode island a month later wasnt successfully contained despite 
quick response because rough seas broke up the oil 
yet prevention is receiving relatively little attention congress 
is spending more time haggling over the liability for future spills 
than on keeping them from happening 
common sense solutions to make another exxon valdez less likely 
have been getting short shrift 
two are particularly important 
a requirement that all oil tankers built for us service have 
double hulls a double hull probably would have prevented serious 
leakage from the exxon valdez despite the extent of the damage it 
sustained existing singlehulled tankers should be phased out 
much stricter licensing standards for tanker crews should be 
adopted inexperience and inattention played a huge part in the 
exxon valdez grounding most of the time tanker operations are 
routine but in an emergency every second counts crews should have 
the expertise necessary to help protect against the huge risks of 
another spill 
its fine to debate the merits of the prince william sound 
cleanup but its much more important to keep such an accident from 
happening again

the indianapolis star on firearms sales 
would a stricter firearms sales law have kept joseph t wesbecker 
from legally buying the ak47 rifle he used in a killing rampage in 
a downtown louisville printing plant 
seven people were shot to death an eighth died later and 13 
others wounded three critically when wesbecker who had been put 
on permanent disability leave last year because of mental illness 
sprayed bullets as he went from floor to floor and then killed 
himself 
louisville police said he had spent time voluntarily in mental 
institutions 
federal law prohibits firearms purchases only by people who have 
been committed to a mental health facility under court order 
relatives said wesbecker was a manic depressive who had attempted 
suicide three times a former coworker said he had threatened his 
bosses before being put on leave 
almost at once the louisville massacre brought an outcry for bans 
on gun sales nothing is to be gained by enacting new laws that 
would keep responsible persons from buying or owning guns 
but the louisville rampage and others like it point to a need for 
revising legislation to prevent sale of firearms to the mentally 
ill a law that fails to keep someone as unbalanced as wesbecker 
from acquiring a highpowered arsenal is a fatally ineffective law

administration is unwilling to acknowledge the connection 
early this summer the colombian government pleaded with the 
united states to support an extension of the international coffee 
agreement to keep coffee prices stable instead the us trade 
representatives office helped dismantle the agreement which has 
unleashed a price war and caused coffee prices in real terms to 
drop to their lowest level in 40 years 
more farmers will abandon coffee and turn to the more profitable 
venture of coca the result is more economic muscle for the 
drug kingpins

worthington minn daily globe on fighting substance abuse 
many of these new tough antidrug and antialcohol proposals 
being proposed by members of both political parties are missing a 
key ingredient 
rather than tougher penalties and prison sentences and heavy 
fines for chemical users more of the funding should be placed into 
chemical dependency treatment programs rather than force the drug 
users to pay fines the judges should require defendants to go to 
treatment programs and pay their own way whether it be inpatient or 
outpatient programs 
many people have witnessed the miracles of the treatment 
programs in minnesota a leader in this field 
more also need to see this side of the story maybe president 
bush should spend some of his time visiting some of these treatment 
centers and programs 
tougher penalties often dont help not until a person gets

the sunherald biloxi miss on the social security earnings 
limit 
some people in congress have discovered a nonewtax way to 
increase the federal governments revenues and the method is 
eminently sensible do away with the social security earnings limit 
the house republican research committee got a report from two 
texas organizations that showed the government would clear an 
estimated 140 million by simply not penalizing social security 
recipients for earning income 
older workers between 65 and 69 now lose 1 in social security 
benefits for every 2 they earn above 8800 eliminate that 
earnings limit the reports says and at least 700000 additionally 
elderly retirees would enter the labor market increasing government 
revenue by 49 billion that would more than offset the higher 
social security benefits that would be paid 
there was a time when one of the purposes of social security was 
to encourage the elderly to retire from the workplace to make room 
for younger workers things are different now 
the social security system has undergone many changes this would 
be one of the more beneficial 
doing away with the earnings test would benefit the government by 
increasing revenues the retirees who would like to return to work 
but not lose their benefits and the nearretirees who would like to 
continue working it also would do no harm to the retirees who want 
to stay retired and the nearretirees who want to quit working 
this is such a nolose proposition that the full congress ought 
to run it through on the fast track

las cruces nm sunnews on smokefree flights 
the space in which the smokers of america can indulge their 
craving keeps shrinking smoking is now banned in many public 
buildings private employers have banned it in office and workplace 
or restricted it to certain areas 
latest defeat for smokers and the tobacco industry came when 
the senate approved a ban on smoking on all domestic airline 
flights the tide is clearly running against the tobacco habit 
americas propensity for proscribing bad habits doubtless traces 
in part to the puritanism inherited from our early forefathers but 
part is certainly attributable to the exceptional concern americans 
have with their health 
and of course we give a wide berth to anything that poses a 
risk of cancer tobaccos happens to be near the top of that list 
that doesnt bode well for the tobacco industry 
smokers are doubtless destined to become an eversmaller minority 
increasingly subject to the displeasure of a vehement majority 
smokers may complain of the tyranny of the majority but thats the 
american way the people impose the curbs on personal behavior the 
government just ratifies them

daily tribune wisconsin rapids wis on smokefree flights 
it was good to see the us senate stand up to the pressures of 
the tobacco interests and do something positive for americans 
health 
the senate voted to ban smoking on all us airline flights 
the action is in the interest of health and safety 
nonsmoking sections on airplanes typically are in the same cabin 
as designated smoking areas so the smoke can bother those who dont 
care to inhale it and studies have pointed out the negative effects 
of secondhand smoke 
there already is a temporary ban on cigarette smoking on all 
domestic flights of two hours or less that measure will expire in 
april 
the house of representatives last month passed a measure to 
permanently ban smoking on the flights of two hours or less 
now a senatehouse conference committee will attempt to work out 
a compromise one would think that means the senate should back down 
from the total ban however fourfifths of all domestic flights are 
two hours or less so why not make the smoking ban easy to follow by 
simply applying it to all flights 
airline passengers cant step outside to get away from the smoke 
they deserve to have clean air to breathe while theyre locked up in 
these aircraft 
in addition banning all smoking would enhance fire safety on the 
planes one careless smoker can cause a lot of harm if a discarded 
cigarette starts a fire 
in an era when more americans are trying to be healthconscious 
it seems reasonable to make the skies smokefree

the mass emigration of east german refugees to west germany by 
way of hungary is an extraordinary development that signals a 
radical shift in policy behind the iron curtain significantly the 
exodus celebrates the free will of human nature and concedes the 
fallacy of authoritarianism and repression as effective tools of 
governance 
nobody really knows at this juncture how many east germans will 
ultimately cross over into west germany some estimates go as high 
as 100000 by the end of the year 
taking note of that possibility west german chancellor helmut 
kohl has urged east germanys leaders to introduce the sort of 
reforms that are being tried in poland and hungary if life in east 
germany improved he reasoned more east germans might stay at home 
freedomloving people everywhere watch and listen with cautious 
approval mindful that in todays uncertain world of realpolitik and 
triggerhappy turbulence a populist celebration can change rapidly

after a revolt by residents selectmen 
decided against trying to straighten out the confusing house 
numbering system in this berkshire hills village 
irate residents voted unanimously to reject an attempt by town 
officials to renumber the maze of victorian homes in order to help 
police fire and ambulance crews respond to calls 
people were attached to their house numbers its like taking 
away your grandmother said tony mcbride who helped organize the 
committee against numerical tyranny 
the confusing system stems from the age of the village founded 
in the 1700s the village has many duplicate numbers and duplicate 
street names and the streets that wind around textile mills and 
quarries and spread up hillsides 
mcbride said the selectmens number changes meant 98 percent of 
the 9000 residents would have to change addresses on everything 
from social security checks to credit cards and drivers licenses 
businesses also would have faced thousands of dollars worth in 
changes in billing lists 
its amazing what little issues can drive people up a wall 
mcbride said in 20 years ive never seen emotion and irritation 
with government so openly expressed if the people could have voted 
to unseat the selectmen right then and there they would have been 
gone 
after the 1260 vote in monday nights town meeting the two 
sides agreed to establish a study committee comprised of three 
residents and two selectmen to find a compromise 
the phones started ringing in town hall immediately after the new 
numbering system which assigned a grid of house numbers to every 
50feet of street went into effect july 28 
its taken all our energies for the past two months said 
matthew j wilk jr chairman of the selectmen our decision will 
have to be reversed im not really happy but the majority will

prosecutors today showed videotapes of jim 
bakker assuring viewers hes not here to make money as they 
sought to portray the tv evangelist as a big spender whose money 
came from believers who could hardly make ends meet 
this is a deal of a lifetime bakker said in an 1986 
broadcast played in court there are no fees this is not a 
profitmaking organization 
bakker was offering a new program that promised 500 donors three 
days and two nights lodging in 16unit facilities called bunk 
houses only one bunk house was completed when bakker quit the 
evangelical empire in 1987 
were not here to make money bakker said in another 
videotape i hope my critics wake up and realize id be a fool if 
i tried to make money off something like this 
the prosecutions contends that bakker used ptl funds raised for 
partnerships to live in high style ptl partners were 
guaranteed lodging at the ministrys hotels 
according to evidence in september 1986 after bakker had sold 
34000 bunkhouse memberships ptl builder roe messner sent him a 
memo agreeing to reduce the number of bunkhouses from six to three 
in six hours of tapes of bakkers the ptl club shown tuesday 
bakker appealed for donations and asked his followers to trust him 
im sincere bakker told viewers in 1984 i would not lie 
to you about anything 
but over and over prosecutor deborah smith halted the tape to 
ask fbi agent john pearson to compare bakkers statements to 
behindthescenes testimony about bakkers television ministry 
in a 1984 videotape bakker urged his audience to pay for 
partnerships with a credit card saying he bought his with a credit 
card because he didnt have any cash the same year prosecutors 
said bakker received 1 million in salary and bonuses and bought a 
palm desert calif home and a rollsroyce 
bakker is accused of diverting more than 37 million in ptl 
money raised from the partnership sales to pay for personal 
luxuries if convicted of the 24 counts against him he could be 
sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than 5 million 
pearson testified that from 1984 through 1986 bakker repeatedly 
misled viewers about how many donors or lifetime partners had 
taken part in the program which offered three nights lodging each 
year for life in return for 1000 
at first bakker exaggerated the number of partnerships ptl had 
issued apparently to project a sense of urgency pearson said 
later the fbi agent said bakker understated the tally and 
didnt acknowledge that he had exceeded his own ceiling and 
endangered the partners chances of using their lodging privileges 
earlier in the trial prosecutors put on the stand several ptl 
partners including the wife of a retired coal miner suffering from 
black lung disease and living on disability pay who testified they 
bought partnerships but could not get rooms 
others have testified that partnerships were oversold and that 
the money from such promotions often was used to cover ptls 
daytoday operating costs rather than finance construction of the 
guaranteed rooms and buildings 
pearson said more than 66000 partnerships were sold to viewers 
by the time bakker left ptl in march 1987 despite a publicized 
limit of 25000 
bakker didnt watch much of the videotapes he scribbled notes 
and looked through documents

the senate foreign relations committee 
overriding objections from the bush administration voted 101 today 
to endorse a democratic aid plan for poland and hungary that would 
send nearly 12 billion to the east bloc nations over three years 
republicans accusing democrats of playing politics on the issue 
walked out before the vote only sen richard g lugar of indiana 
stayed to register the lone no vote calling it an egregious 
mistake 
the economic development funds in the democratic measure which 
dwarf the 100 million requested by president bush over a threeyear 
period represent an urgently needed gamble for freedom in 
eastern europe said sen paul simon dill 
raymond seitz assistant secretary of state for european affairs 
testified that although the legislation contains most of the 
elements of the bush proposal the administration cannot endorse 
the higher funding levels 
to do so would be contrary to the budget principles of the 
congress and the administration seitz said 
seitz said the surging reform movements in eastern europe are 
genuine and something we have hoped for all of our lives 
it would be the saddest thing if we wrecked it in some sort of 
procedural or partisan wrangle seitz said 
were headed for the rocky shoals of a partisan debate which is 
not going to result in anything good for the poles said lugar who 
said no additional funds are available to pay for increased 
assistance for the two countries 
in my view this is an attempt to tweak the president to cause 
a partisan row on the senate floor lugar said but the rest of 
the world is not amused by this kind of irresponsibility 
sen alan cranston dcalif called the bush proposals 
pathetically timid and said they failed to grasp the historic 
opportunity at hand 
on monday senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine also 
criticized the administrations proposed aid for poland and hungary 
as a failure to exploit an historic opportunity in the soviet bloc 
secretary of state james a baker iii said tuesday that mitchell 
was playing politics on the issue the president is rocking along 
with a 70 percent approval rating in foreign policy said baker 
and if i were the senate majority leader i might have something 
like that to say too 
mitchell called bakers response to his remarks predictable and 
disappointing 
baker will better serve the nation and the president if he 
addresses the substance of my remarks rather than resorting to 
accusations about politics said mitchell 
the 118 billion democratic aid proposal would authorize 423 
million in the 1990 fiscal year beginning oct 1 and 381 million in 
both the 1991 and 1992 fiscal years 
additional democraticsponsored legislation to boost food aid to 
poland is pending before the senate agriculture committee 
president bush initially proposed 119 million in aid for poland 
over three years last week in response to congressional pressure 
including appeals from senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
he proposed another 50 million in food assistance 
the centerpiece of the democratic proposal is an annual 300 
million enterprise fund over the next three years to support 
economic development in poland 
itwould also authorize spending 75 million for each of the next 
three years to provide a similar fund for hungary 
cranston said democrats would skim the money from the 40 billion 
spent by the pentagon each year for research and development 
the bill which combines elements of the administrations aid 
proposals with proposals by congressional democrats would also 
authorize the extension of overseas private investment corp 
guarantees to us businesses investing in poland and hungary 
authorize the extension of trade preference benefits to poland 
authorize 11 million in scientific and education exchanges 
along with medical assistance and help in building democratic 
institutions for poland and hungary 
authorize 25 million in aid to help modernize polands 
telecommunications system 
authorize 3 million for peace corps activities in poland and 
hungary 
direct the president to encourage debtforequity swaps and debt 
rescheduling negotiations to help poland deal with its massive 
foreign debt 
authorize the president to pursue other initiatives including a 
possible airlift of food to the polish people

a majority of city residents drink bottled or 
filtered water rather than that from from household taps a survey 
found 
respondents said tap water doesnt taste good and treated water 
is considered safer according to the survey released this week 
another survey found that those relying on bottled or filtered 
water include a majority of city department of water and power 
employees 
the first survey of customers reported 64 percent use bottled or 
filtered drinking water with 53 percent preferring only bottled 
water and 19 percent using home filters some used both 
employees surveyed indicate that 59 percent use bottled or 
filtered water or both employees from inside and outside city 
limits were surveyed 
dwp officials were concerned about the findings but were not 
completely surprised because of publicity given to toxic 
contamination levels in some water supplies 
were just fighting an uphill battle to try to get out the 
correct information about the water supply said dan waters a dwp 
assistant general manager dwp provides water and electric power to 
the more than 33 million city residents 
better taste was cited by 54 percent of the customers who used 
alternative sources while 40 percent said they were concerned about 
safety 
douglas nelson president of the international bottled water 
association estimated that one of every two residents of southern 
california drinks bottled or filtered water 
nelson said the findings of the survey indicated the highest 
incidence in the country of bottled and filtered water use

congressional democrats trying to get a jump 
on president bushs education summit announced a series of goals 
today aimed at upgrading americas school system 
declaring our leadership in education is indisputable the 
democratic leaders proposed six performance goals to reinvigorate 
the american partnership in education to set a benchmark for the 
education summit with the governors 
arkansas democratic gov bill clinton in charge of the national 
governors associations preparations for the summit insisted that 
money is not a key issue and that funding would fall in line 
once there is public commitment from everyone 
but sen claiborne pell of rhode island said the emphasis on 
funding is needed so that the proven programs we have begun can do 
even better work and so that together we might achieve the 
ultimate goal of educational opportunity for all 
the goals are 
increase each year the number of preschool children attending 
early childhood development programs such as head start until 
all disadvantaged 4yearold children are served by 1995 
raise the basic skills achievement of all students to their 
grade level and sharply reduce the discrepancy in test scores among 
white black and hispanic students by 1993 
improve the high school graduation rate every year by reducing 
the number of dropouts and the number of illiterate americans 
annually improve the math science and foreign language 
performance of american students 
increase college participation by all americans especially 
minorities by 1993 and reduce the imbalance between grants and 
loans in financing a college education by the year 2000 
increase each year the number of fully qualified teachers 
available in the schools 
proposing specific goals is in itself a bold step forward 
the democrats said in a joint statement never before have 
congress the white house or the states sought to develop 
performance goals for our schools and colleges our list is the 
basic minimum but vital and necessary these goals will if 
achieved result in enormous improvements 
at a separate news conference keith geiger president of the 
national education association released a classroom agenda for 
the education summit that proposed essentially the same types of 
activities as outlined by the congressional democrats and the 
national governors association 
geiger insisted that money should be a key focus of the summit 
and noted that for every 3 state and local governments added to 
education in the 1980s the federal government took 1 away he said 
the federal share of the school dollar for elementary and secondary 
schools declined from 92 percent in 1981 to 63 percent in 1989 
this is no way to meet a national challenge declared geiger 
now more than ever we need to guarantee adequate funding for 
education at all levels local state and federal the federal 
government must become a more active partner in promoting progress 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine and house 
majority leader richard gephardt of missouri said they were not 
trying to upstage the president by releasing their proposal a week 
before the summit 
the democratic party has long championed educational 
opportunity for all americans said mitchell the major federal 
education programs were democratic initiatives our leadership in 
education is historic and enduring 
the congressional leaders joined by sens edward kennedy 
dmass and claiborne pell dri and several house democrats 
used a highly acclaimed suburban maryland high school as the 
backdrop today to announce the ambitious goals 
bush who will lead the education summit with the nations 
governors in charlottesville va next week has supported the view 
of many governors that discussions should focus on how to establish 
national performance goals or targets 
the president has indicated actual goals would be set later 
after educators parents members of congress and others give their 
opinions 
the democrats say their performance goals can be used by the 
white house as they hammer out more details and specific numerical 
targets in finalizing national standards 
the summit will mark the third time a president has called the 
governors together to tackle one subject 
theodore roosevelt brought the governors together in 1908 to 
discuss how to conserve americas natural resources in 1933 
franklin d roosevelt sought governors advice on the great 
depression

republican leaders said today it is almost 
certain congress will fail to agree on a deficit reduction measure 
by midoctober leading to automatic spending cuts in hundreds of 
government programs 
sen pete domenici after a meeting with president bush said the 
cuts would total about 168 billion including a 53 percent cut in 
domestic spending and about 46 percent from defense programs 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law requires congress and the 
president to reduce the deficit to within 10 billion of the 100 
billion 1990 deficit target by that date failure to come in under 
that ceiling triggers automatic spending cuts in almost all budget 
categories under the law 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater agreed there was a 
somewhat bleak prospect for averting the spending cuts 
several spending issues stand in the way of agreement he said 
and he urged congress to overcome the problems 
the deficit reduction bill needed to avert those cuts is 
threatened with defeat in the house because most democrats oppose 
its cut in the capital gains tax rate republicans oppose other 
provisions including child care legislation 
it is almost certain that congress will fail to reconcile 
competing financial interests and get the budget passed by the 
deadline of oct 1 the beginning of fiscal year 1990 said house 
republican leader newt gingrich 
after the gop meeting bush held the second in a series of 
preeducation summit consultations with leading educators saying he 
hoped they did not feel they were talking to a deck that had 
already been stacked 
the annual spending bills needed to keep the government operating 
are stalled in the senate where republicans are blocking action in 
an attempt to force democrats to back down on their plan to expand 
the presidents antidrug plan 
gingrich said bush was firm in his opposition to a tax rate 
increase to help raise revenues to offset the deficit 
to propose such an increase is to guarantee a veto as is 
inclusion of addon spending projects that bush opposes 
if in fact it has a childcare bill that is unacceptable and if 
it has pension proposals that are unacceptable hell veto it 
he blamed the house and senate leadership for the failure to get 
agreement on the budget and said the cuts which would begin oct 
16 would lead to a tremendous amount of confusion throughout 
the government as programs such as student aid drug and enforcement 
and other areas try to cope with the cuts 
on the education front the educators have not been invited to 
bushs summit with governors in charlottesville va next wednesday 
and thursday 
bush explaining the educators exclusion said im putting a 
lot of stock in the governors conference because they have 
expressed a keen interest in this they are on the cutting edge 
and we think its an appropriate way to have a national conference 
the fact that its the governors does not mean that we want to 
limit the input to governors alone the president told the 
educators including university of tennessee president and former 
governor lamar alexander and ernest l boyer president of the 
carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
bush urged them to offer their recommendations to the governors 
as well as the white house

most black college students aspiring to 
become teachers in south carolina fail a test that ninthgraders 
should be able to pass state education officials say 
over the past five years 31 percent of the blacks who took the 
state education entrance examination passed it on the first try 
compared with 80 percent of whites according to a state department 
of education review 
college students have three chances to pass the test a 
requirement for admission to a teacher education program 
after the third attempt about 91 percent of the 11999 whites 
who took the test had passed blacks did better too with 46 
percent of the 1802 who took it passing not everyone who fails 
takes the test again 
one of the main problems is that minorities have a history 
nationally of not doing well on standardized tests said elmer 
knight director of teacher education and certification 
but earline m simms dean of education at south carolina state 
college a predominantly black school said the difference probably 
has more to do with how rich or poor the students families were and 
whether education was emphasized in their homes 
simms said she was sick and tired of that excuse about 
standardized tests being a problem for blacks 
we do have a crisis in black education simms said we do 
have a crisis in the black family its disintegrating but its not 
just a black problem there are many white students reading at a 
sixthgrade level 
the test was first given in 1982 to weed out students who didnt 
have basic reading writing and mathematics skills 
knight said the test had produced better teacher candidates by 
forcing some who were borderline to go back to strengthen their 
skills

from the storm that threatened christopher 
columbus in 1494 to last years powerful gilbert the death and 
destruction wrought by hurricanes have been an intimate part of life 
in america 
good god what horror and destruction wrote a 15yearold 
alexander hamilton after experiencing a hurricane in the west indies 
in 1772 
the roaring of the sea and wind fiery meteors flying about in 
the air the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning the 
crash of falling houses and the earpiercing shrieks of the 
distressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into angels 
hamilton reported in a letter to his father 
hurricanes have played an awsome role in the american panorama 
they have touched the lives of americans great and small and at 
times changed the course of our destiny as well as the shape of 
our coastline writes patrick hughes managing editor of 
weatherwise magazine 
the deadliest of these massive storms killed 6000 people 
sweeping away much of galveston texas in 1900 and thousands have 
perished in other storms over the years 
yet one hurricane may have prevented war between the united 
states and germany another inspired shakespeares play the 
tempest and a third caused a young planters daughter to leave 
her caribbean home for france eventually to wed napoleon and become 
empress josephine 
columbus and his crew were probably the first europeans to 
encounter a hurricane sailing through the fringes of one near 
hispaniola in 1494 and confronting another at full force near santo 
domingo in 1502 
a weatherwary seaman columbus recognized the signs of the 
approaching tempest and took his ship into a protected cove to ride 
out that second storm 
others refused to heed his warning and set forth for spain 
twenty ships and 500 men led by adm frencisco de bobadilla were 
never seen again 
in the next few years both ponce de leon and hermando cortes 
were shipwrecked in hurricanes though both went on to become famous 
explorers 
in 1609 the english were seeking to settle the new world and 
one small fleet heading for virginia was overwhelmed by a hurricane 
while many ships limped into jamestown the ship sea adventure 
was feared lost until 10 months later when its passengers and crew 
arrived in a small boat they had built from the wreckage of their 
ship 
the sea advanture had been driven ashore on bermuda an island 
unknown to sailors until that event when the account of their 
harrowing voyage and discovery was published in london in 1612 it 
intrigued william shakespeare who was inspired to write the play 
the tempest 
it was august 13 1766 when a hurricane swept over the tiny 
caribbean island of martinique wiping out the farms of wealthy 
planter josephgaspard tascher 
with the family facing poverty one of his daughters josephine 
marie rose returned to france where she met and married an 
ambitious young army officer named napoleon bonaparte 
a storm just six years later sent america one of its young 
revolutionaries hamiltons letter to his father describing the 1772 
storm so impressed local planters on the island of st croix that 
they took up a collection and sent him to college in america 
weather historian david m ludlum speculates in his book the 
weather factor that a hurricane may have prolonged the american 
revolution 
british and french fleets were facing off near rhode island in 
1778 with the french upwind and holding the advantage until a 
hurricane arrived damaging many ships and scattering the vessels 
had the french been able to engage and defeat the british ludlum 
suggests they might have achieved naval supremacy and thus hastened 
the american vistory 
another hurricane thousands of miles away and just over a century 
later may have prevented a war 
the 1880s were a time when many nations were establishing 
colonial empires and germany sought control over several islands in 
the pacific 
in 1888 a german naval task force seeking to take control of 
samoa shelled a native village some american property was destroyed 
and an american flag was torn down by german sailors 
american warships rushed to the scene and naval vessels of the 
two nations faced one another at apia harbor on march 16 1889 
but before hostilities could begin a savage hurricane 
overwhelmed the area and ships of both nations were wrecked or 
driven aground sailors from both sides came to one anothers aid in 
the struggle to survive 
nearing the present no hurricane can compare with the toll of 
6000 american lives lost when a hurricane driven surge of water 
swept over galveston island in 1900 another 1000 likely died 
elsewhere in that storm though the exact toll may never be known 
gilbert in 1988 was perhaps one of the stringest hurricanes of 
this century though it spent most of its fury in the islands and 
mexico claiming only a few lives in texas

presidential assailant john hinckley said today 
he does not have a serious mental illness and wants to conduct up to 
two interviews a month with the news media to demonstrate that 
barred by the government from meeting with the press hinckley 
said he has been placed in a maximumsecurity ward at a mental 
hospital by federal officials who want to keep him isolated from the 
press 
i wish to be able to meet with somebody who is not part of 
the hospital or the government hinckley told us 
district court judge june green during a hearing on his request 
a directive at st elizabeths hospital where hinckley is held 
bars maximumsecurity patients from conducting personal interviews 
with the media it permits such patients to correspond with the 
media by mail 
hinckley said he wants somebody who is impartial to talk 
with me and decide for themselves if i am mentally ill or not and 
then report that finding 
he said the government has orchestrated a campaign to portray 
him as psychotic and that for me to battle without being 
permitted to show otherwise is a great handicap to me 
the way the situation is now we have the blackout going where i 
can never in any way be seen or heard by anybody who is in the least 
bit impartial hinckley said under questioning by his lawyer mark 
lane i think its set up that way intentionally i dont believe 
i am this seriously ill person 
he said he wants to conduct interviews with the washington post 
and abc news 
he said he doubts he would do two interviews a month even if 
permitted to do so he said he specified that number in his request 
so the court doesnt think i would go hog wild 
hinckley was acquitted in 1982 by reason of insanity of shooting 
president reagan thenpresidential press secretary james brady a 
washington police officer and a secret service agent the shooting 
has left brady partially paralyzed 
excerpts from a psychiatrists 1987 evaluation of hinckley said 
his mental condition was showing improvement and that he exhibited 
remorse and guilt over the 1981 shooting incident in 1982 the 
evaluation noted hinckley said the incident was akin to shooting 
a mannequin

william f buckley jr says hes come up 
with a idea to simultaneously help the soviet economy and eliminate 
the threat of attack buy the soviet arsenal and dump it in the 
ocean 
i would propose a purchase of nonreplenishable soviet military 
equipment nuclear and nonnuclear at 100 billion per year for 
the next three years said the merrily provocative host of 
televisions firing line and founder of the conservative 
magazine national review 
the missiles and warheads and tanks and submarines and armed 
carriers would file out of soviet ports onto us shipping and upon 
reaching the continental shelf the cargo would be jettisoned out to 
sea he said tuesday at the university of north alabama 
the financing of the enterprise would be done by reducing our 
own military budget by 100 billion per year for three years which 
under these special circumstances we could afford to do he said 
buckley called his proposal complicated in detail but not 
inconceivable 
on another subject buckley said the war against drugs will 
result only in more of the same more crime more corruption 
more hospitalization more deaths 
the author received an ovation with his proposal that the sale of 
all drugs be legal to anyone over the age of 21 at a price that 
would prevent the rise of a black market for drugs he also said 
anyone convicted of selling drugs to a minor should be given the 
death penalty 
the two proposals have i think the advantage psychologically 
of expressing societys acceptance of biological realities while at 
the same time allowing our society to express the gravity with which 
it views the drug problem buckley said

a virginia center for high technology 
criticized by some for being too costly and secretive opened 
wednesday with a splashy display of gadgets designed for business 
medicine and the military 
the center for innovative technology formally dedicated five 
years after being chartered by the state general assembly displayed 
a dozen centersupported projects including a computer operated 
with eye movements and a bed designed to benefit both hospital 
patients and insomniacs 
reporters attending an open house tuesday in advance of wednesday 
nights official dedication of the 345 million center also were 
shown a fiberoptic sensing system designed to warn of aircraft 
vibrations or help make submarines quieter and a device that allows 
handwritten data to be entered into a computer 
there was a fireextinguishing system for computers 
electromagnetic bearings that can replace traditional lubricating 
systems for machines a briefcasesize computer workstation and 
facsimile machine that can send encrypted messages by cellular 
telephone and a testing kit to find bacterial infections in milk 
cows 
the controversial center which symbolizes the nationwide push by 
state legislatures to attract and hold hightechnology businesses 
is located in an inverted pyramidshaped building near washington 
dulles international airport 
it has been under fire since 1984 when virginia lawmakers 
approved a plan by thengov charles robb to establish a nonprofit 
facility to link private enterprise with the states college and 
university research programs 
the center has had four presidents in as many years investing 
more than 37 million in research projects while attracting nearly 
56 million in matching funds from private industry and other 
sources 
its 198890 budget is 272 million and it is seeking 416 
million for 19911993 it has a staff of 30 
critics say its mission remains unfocused it is too costly and 
secretive and that the money could better be spent by virginia 
educational institutions 
its president former virginia gov linwood holton said tuesday 
he thinks the center is over that hump 
but holton acknowledged there is an image problem caused as the 
center tries to balance being accountable to taxpayers with not 
revealing trade secrets that have potentially high economic values 
cit officials say nearly 400 companies have been persuaded to 
cosponsor more than 450 research projects including the eyegaze 
computer system developed by lc technologies of fairfax va based 
on research at the university of virginia 
the machine costs between 32000 and 68000 and two have been 
sold to disabled individuals a third was sold to the virginia 
department of rehabilitative services cit received a 1600 royalty 
check from one of the private sales holton said 
eyegaze looks like a personal computer but uses a camera system 
that interprets the eye movements of the operator by focusing 
briefly on a keyboard on the computer screen a user may type 
messages open or close files or gain access to ibmcompatible 
software 
eye movements also will operate household appliances such as 
lights and televisions with lc technologies software that links the 
machine with offtheshelf mechanical hardware 
another invention the good turn bed can contort into seven 
different positions to relieve patient suffering or it can aid 
insomniacs by continually moving to reduce tossing and turning 
during sleep 
the center also has helped develop a machine that harvests 
cucumbers without bruising them and a process to remove polluting 
sulfur from coal

a miami lawyer who showed up in court 
unexpectedly to represent two alleged cocaine smugglers was slapped 
with a subpoena for a grand jury investigation into whether he had 
been sent by faroff drug bosses 
this is an outrage said the lawyer david s markus this 
is what us attorneys do to discourage people from hiring their own 
attorneys 
the two drug suspects already had been given courtappointed 
attorneys when markus joined them at the defense table during a bail 
hearing tuesday 
federal prosecutors immediately subpoenaed him 
our obligation the courts obligation and the bars obligation 
is to assure that lawyers actually represent the clients in the 
courtroom and not a drug boss located far away whos only interest 
is to shut up the defendant and to hamper law enforcement said 
us attorney raymond lamonica 
we will use all lawful means to determine the scope of a 
criminal conspiracy and those involved 
the drug suspects leonardo eugenio macchiavello 35 of miami 
and hector baraditt 39 of elmhurst ny were accused of 
attempting to transport 17 million worth of cocaine through baton 
rouge in a station wagon 
one of the courtappointed attorneys david stanley told us 
magistrate stephen riedlinger that he and the other courtappointed 
counsel received a phone call last week from an unidentified man who 
said lawyers had been retained by the families of macchiavello and 
baraditt 
but macchiavello and baraditt told the magistrate tuesday that 
they were happy with their courtappointed lawyers

evan mecham the first governor removed by 
impeachment in nearly 60 years is asking the state supreme court to 
overturn his conviction reinstate him and pay him about 500000 
the maverick republican conservative who is running for governor 
again in 1990 says he expects to win in federal court if the state 
high court rejects the arguments hell present thursday 
but government lawyers defending mechams house impeachment and 
senate conviction say the supreme court should not even take 
jurisdiction of such a frivolous case much less grant mechams 
motions 
attorney general bob corbin is asking that the case be thrown out 
and that mecham be assessed costs of bringing the lawsuit 
lawyers on both sides know of only one case a 1919 ruling in 
alabama in which an impeached official was reinstated courts 
generally have held that impeachments are political in nature and 
that they are not subject to court review in the absence of a major 
violation of constitutional rights 
mecham was ousted by the senate on april 4 1988 on civil 
charges that he misused money in a state protocol fund and 
obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation of 
allegations that one of his aides had threatened another aide 
he had taken office less than 16 months earlier after a bruising 
campaign during which he upset several establishment favorites to 
become governor on his fifth try 
and though he had predicted smooth sailing with the 
republicancontrolled legislature he drew criticism with vetoes 
controversial appointments cancellation of a holiday honoring 
martin luther king and statements that appeared to insult women 
homosexuals blacks and orientals 
by the time impeachment proceedings began in earnest he was 
telling audiences that attorney general bob corbin a fellow 
republican had been spying on him with laser beams 
mecham was not impeached and convicted for high crimes 
misdemeanors or malfeasance instead he was impeached and 
convicted for being mecham his attorneys argued in briefs filed 
before thursdays hearing the sad truth is that notwithstanding 
mechams election to office by the people of arizona mecham was a 
political outsider having few partisans among established 
legislators or in the media 
mechams lawyers argue the impeachment should be overturned 
because the senators failed to vote separately on each subcharge 
within each main charge leaving it unclear whether lawmakers ever 
reached the required twothirds majority on any one accusation 
they also say the protocol fund statute was unconstitutional to 
begin with because of a drafting flaw and that mecham was denied his 
right to due process by irregularities in the senate trial 
including the absence of some of senators at times 
the governments lawyers say it doesnt matter whether the 
protocol fund statute was constitutional because mechams 
representatives signed a contract agreeing to abide by it and that 
mecham committed malfeasance when he violated the contract 
they also say the state constitution clearly gives the senate the 
right to make its own rules about such things as attendance and 
charges 
furthermore they say mecham waited too long to bring the 
lawsuit and should have filed it in a lower court 
in addition to reinstatement as governor mecham wants about 
200000 for attorneys fees in the impeachment about 182000 to 
cover his costs in preparing for a recall election that was canceled 
by his ouster the 92000 that was in the protocol fund and back 
pay as governor 
he also is seeking return of the protocol fund in a maricopa 
county superior court suit filed earlier the money came from 
campaign supporters but after questions were raised over whether it 
had been collected legally campaign aides administering it agreed 
it would be used as a protocol fund 
besides mechams claims thursdays 90minute hearing involves an 
overlapping set of motions by two longtime mecham supporters who 
claim their constitutional rights were abridged by the impeachment 
because lawmakers were told not to listen to their constituents

amid expressions of concern from two members of 
congress a pentagonappointed ombudsman has left for the far east 
to look into allegations of censorship and employee harassment at 
the pacific edition of the military newspaper stars amp stripes 
the ombudsman philip m foisie planned to meet with the 
newspapers staff during his trip as well as with the 
commanderinchief of the us pacific command adm huntington 
hardisty a pentagon official said wednesday 
the official spoke on condition he not be named 
foisie a former washington post editor was appointed to the 
post of ombudsman for the pentagons military newspapers earlier 
this year partially in response to the ongoing problems at the 
publications 
rep barbara boxer dcalif said in an interview tuesday that 
civilian employees have contacted her office with allegations of 
censorship and actions taken against employees who have dealt with 
congress about the problems 
what we have here is harassment of whistle blowers and 
censorship boxer said its bad enough to censor the news our 
men and women in uniform deserve the news as all of us get it as 
harsh as it is but theyre not getting it 
the general accounting office assisted by the society of 
professional journalists sigma delta chi reported last year that 
it found evidence of censorship and improper management at the 
governmentrun daily paper 
boxer and earl hutto dfla chairman of the house armed 
services readiness subcommittee have written hardisty asking him 
to investigate the situation 
pentagon spokesman william hart said the papers military editors 
deny the claims of censorship and contend they have not been given 
solid evidence to back up the allegations 
well let the ombudsman play his role hart said these 
newspapers are essential to the military overseas if there is 
evidence of censorship that needs to come out but if it is only 
editorial judgment that is being exercised that needs to come out 
too 
in her letter boxer cited evidence of harassment of 
journalists who have expressed their views to senior management and 
to members of congress 
boxer cited the cases of bill bartman who was removed from his 
position as the washington bureau chief of the pacific edition and 
pacific editor dewey brackman who has been temporarily relieved of 
his duties and assigned work as a supervisory editor 
hutto in a letter obtained by the associated press said he had 
received information about questionable management and personnel 
practices including continued efforts at news management at stars 
amp stripes 
the gao recommended that the editorinchief should be a civilian 
rather than a military officer with solid journalism credentials 
the house armed services committee in the defense authorization 
bill report for fiscal 1990 said the editor should have solid 
journalistic credentials but stopped short of calling for a civilian 
in the post 
the gao investigation was launched last year at the request of 
former sen william proxmire dwis 
although frequently referred to as one newspaper the stars and 
stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous 
bureaus in west germany and japan 
they were designed to serve as the hometown paper for 
american servicemen posted overseas the papers have a long history 
that dates to publication in france during world war i 
the pentagon describes the papers as authorized but unofficial 
publications both operate under a charter to provide a free 
flow of news and information without censorship or news 
management 
reporters who have worked for the papers say they walk a 
tightrope between reporting the news and satisfying military 
commanders worried about local sensitivities in the host country

members of a university of mississippi 
fraternity painted racial slurs on the naked bodies of two white 
pledges and dumped them on the campus of a mostly black college 
nearby 
they had no idea that there were racial connotations in it 
they should have but they appeared not to have viewed it that 
way ole miss public relations director ed meek said wednesday 
when i was informed of it i was shocked and angered 
university chancellor gerald turner said tuesday night he said he 
had apologized to rust college and had instructed the beta theta pi 
fraternity which was involved in the monday night incident to do 
the same 
ishmell edwards dean of students at rust 25 miles north in 
holly springs said the fraternity chapters officers apologized in 
person and in writing to college officials 
witnesses said the two naked fraternity members with kkk and 
we hate niggers painted on their chests ran into the rust 
college security office to escape pursuing rust college students 
were treating this as a very serious violation of good taste 
and ethics on our campus and were doing a thorough investigation 
meek said 
he said a closed disciplinary hearing for perhaps individuals 
as well as the fraternity has been scheduled for friday ole miss 
officials probably wont announce results until monday or tuesday 
my impression is it was a small group of students all of whom 
where freshmen meek said of those involved in the prank adding 
that it was not students who were familiar with campus rules or 
who were more mature 
fraternity treasurer brad gunner a senior from tupelo said 
national leaders of beta theta pi had suspended the ole miss 
chapters charter and were coming to oxford to investigate 
personally i believe theres going to be a lot of cleaning 
house in that there will be a totally different chapter in about two 
weeks if a chapter at all said gunner who is also president of 
the campus interfraternity council

fw de klerk was sworn in as 
president wednesday and promised a new constitution that would bring 
blacks into south africas government by the end of his fiveyear 
term 
he appealed to south africans of all races to help build a nation 
free of domination and oppression 
we accept that time is of the essence and we are committed to 
visible evolutionary progress de klerk said in his inaugural 
speech 
he has vowed to eliminate discrimination and allow blacks who 
currently cannot vote participation in government under a fiveyear 
plan 
but he did not specify any apartheid laws he would repeal nor 
did he say how he would implement his goal of providing limited 
political rights to the 28million black majority while maintaining 
the political domination of the countrys 5 million whites 
de klerk 53 took the oath of office as reports spread that his 
government will free jailed black nationalist leader nelson mandela 
early next year newspapers quoted official sources as saying the 
release will be part of a package of reforms to draw blacks into 
constitutional talks 
the negotiation process will from the start receive incisive 
attention de klerk said in the speech following his swearingin 
ceremony 
his conciliatory words affable style and new policy of allowing 
peaceful protests against the government have generated optimism 
among foreign observers and many south africans but de klerk 
rejects the basic demand of most black leaders majority rule 
the rev allan boesak a leading antiapartheid activist and 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches said he will 
give de klerk six months to prove that blacks skepticism is 
unfounded 
a tear rolled down de klerks cheek at a dutch reformed church 
when the rev pw bingle a family friend preaching at the 
swearingin urged the new president to press forward without fear 
chief justice michael corbett handed de klerk a paper from which 
he read the oath of office in afrikaans and english before about 
1500 people no foreign heads of state were present an indication 
of south africas international isolation 
motorcyle policemen a cavalry unit and whitejacketed 
presidential guards with drawn swords lined the route of de klerks 
motorcade to an amphitheater at union buildings the seat of the 
executive branch of government on a ridge overlooking pretoria 
black and white choirs sang hymns and african songs three impala 
air force jets flew over trailing smoke in the blue white and 
orange colors of the south african flag and several people among 
the crowd of 3500 screamed when a 21gun salute began announcing de 
klerks arrival 
in his 20minute inaugural speech de klerk said his goal is a 
south africa free of domination or oppression in whatever form 
we hope that he will demonstrate that he is serious about 
his vision for a new south africa because that is the vision we 
want anglican archbishop desmond tutu the 1984 nobel peace prize 
winner said in windhoek namibia 
de klerk said his government will move to eliminate 
discriminatory laws give urgent attention to adopting a bill of 
rights gradually move away from the 3yearold state of 
emergency and release security prisoners 
de klerk did not mention mandela by name but said political 
prisoners would be freed if public order was not threatened and 
their release would enhance peace prospects 
many south africans consider mandela their top leader and his 
freedom has been demanded as a condition for negotiations mandela 
was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1962 for allegedly plotting to 
overthrow the white government 
as wednesdays ceremony began a group of human rights lawyers in 
pretoria announced de klerk had commuted the death sentences of 
seven convicted murderers including a black activist convicted of 
burning to death of a black constable during nationwide 
antigovernment unrest that prompted former president pw botha to 
impose the national emergency 
de klerk became acting president aug 15 a day after the cabinet 
forced botha to resign after 11 years in power 
de klerks national party retained power after national elections 
on sept 6 but suffered huge losses in parliament to leftist and 
rightist factions 
de klerk practiced law before entering parliament in 1973 from 
1978 he held a series of cabinet posts and in 1982 took on the 
powerful job of national party leader in transvaal south africas 
most populous and wealthy province 
de klerk and his wife marike have three children

even if mikhail s gorbachev is ousted in the 
upheaval he has touched off in the soviet union his ideas will 
survive former defense secretary robert s mcnamara predicts in a 
book urging the united states to seize gorbachevs offer to end 40 
years of mutual hostility 
if gorbachevs efforts fail and they may his successor will 
face the same problems mcnamara writes to solve them he will 
be required ultimately to introduce the same solution there may be 
steps forward and steps back but for the next decade or two it is 
likely the soviet union will move in the general direction laid down 
by the general secretary 
so mcnamara argues there is little risk in striking a deal with 
gorbachev 
in out of the cold the former president of the ford motor 
co who served in the pentagon during the kennedy and johnson 
administrations and then headed the world bank offers his ideas for 
shaping a postcold war relationship 
gorbachevs ideas have been so dramatic so revolutionary as to 
literally imply a desire to end the cold war says mcnamara but 
the united states has found it difficult to offer anything but 
skeptical unimaginative and very cautious responses 
in an interview mcnamara declined to join fellow democrats in 
blaming president bush for a timid response to gorbachev 
i think all of us are skeptical he said were captive of 
this cold war mentality 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine this week 
accused the administration of acting as though it were almost 
nostalgic about the cold war 
secretary of state james baker iii characterized mitchells 
comment as partisan and responded when the president of the 
united states is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating on 
his handling of foreign policy and i were the leader of the 
opposition party i might have something similar to say 
mcnamara said that what he would ask bush to do is visualize a 
world without the cold war that seems simple and obvious and naive 
but it isnt my whole life has been lived as a participant in the 
cold war 
he said in writing the book that he went back to the world before 
the cold war he proposes an update of the atlantic charter framed 
by two world leaders of that day winston churchill and franklin d 
roosevelt 
the code of conduct mcnamara offers calls for settling 
disputes through diplomacy rather than by military threat and 
agreeing to stay out of regional conflicts particularly those on 
the doorstep of a rival superpower 
if such a code had been in effect in place of the cold war 
soviet intervention in afghanistan would have been avoided he says 
as well as soviet intervention in angola via the cubans in 
indochina via the north vietnamese and in korea via the north 
koreans 
and the world would have been spared american intervention in 
vietnam of which he was an architect as well as in the dominican 
republic nicaragua grenada and the persian gulf and french and 
british intervention in egypt 
even in the soviet union there has been much speculation that 
the processes gorbachev has started will lead to his downfall in 
his book mcnamara said most us experts on the soviet union appear 
to believe that gorbacev has moved so fast and so far that he will 
be unable to survive he said he does not share that view 
but glasnost the system of openness and new thinking gorbachev 
has unleashed will prove irreversible mcnamara wrote and the 
united states should take advantage of its opportunity to forge a 
new relationship 
even if gorbachev stumbles soviet leaders and intellectuals 
understand there is no alternative to his political and economic 
reforms if longterm economic crises and resultant political 
disorders are to be avoided mcnamara said

the economy continued to grow late this summer 
at a pace ranging regionally from slow to moderate while inflation 
eased over much of the nation the federal reserve reported 
wednesday 
analysts said the report indicates the fed continues to attain 
its goal of easing inflationary pressures without slowing the 
economy so much that it is driven into a recession 
it says theres some softness but no declines said samuel 
d kahan chief financial economist for kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago it suggests yet again the 
softlanding scenario seems to be unfolding 
in a survey of economic conditions around the country the 
central bank said most of its districts describe the growth of 
economic activity as modest or slow although regional variation in 
activity is substantial 
the survey also found that pricing pressures have eased in five 
of the 12 fed districts while increasing only in the kansas city 
region 
the survey by the 12 district banks is compiled in the feds 
beige book every six weeks to prepare for the next meeting of 
the federal open market committee the feds monetary policysetting 
arm the next meeting is oct 3 
kahan said the report is likely to lead the fed to put monetary 
policy on hold even though its bias is toward easing interest 
rates 
while growth was generally mixed from region to region the 
survey results were consistent with the feds earlier findings this 
year 
fed districts reported aug 9 that the nations economy 
continues to grow slowly and on june 21 said economic activity 
for the most of the nation continues to advance with ebbing 
rates of expansion in some regions the economy was growing at a 
moderate sustainable pace in the may 3 survey 
in its latest survey completed sept 12 the fed reported 
consumer spending has been mixed but most districts report strong 
sales of apparel and cars recently 
in some districts it found increased sales of womens apparel 
spurred overall apparel growth 
a surge in auto sales has helped reduce auto inventories over 
most of the nation it said 
however auto sales were driven by incentives during much of the 
summer and dealers in several districts expressed fears that those 
sales would cut into purchases of 1990 models later this year 
demand for loans also continued to vary considerably by region 
and type of loan the survey said auto loans appeared to be a major 
factor in determining consumer loan growth 
the survey found manufacturing performance generally satisfactory 
or improving in the south and west but weakening in new england and 
much of the midwest manufacturing inventories generally were at 
satisfactory levels 
it also said there was substantial variation in the strength of 
construction and real estate activity with several districts 
reporting falling mortgage rates had stimulated the construction and 
sales of existing homes 
only three districts boston st louis and san francisco 
reported labor shortages 
agricultural conditions have improved over much of the 
country the survey said while the mining ndustry has showed 
increased activity in the minneapolis dallas atlanta and kansas 
city districts in recent months

nato will present new proposals that for 
the first time foresee limiting the number of troops taking part in 
military exercises across europe diplomatic sources said wednesday 
the proposals are in a package of conventionial arms control cuts 
that the western alliance intends to present thursday to the warsaw 
pact the sources said on condition of anonymity 
they would oblige both sides to give advance notice of a major 
mobilization of reservists and of large troop movements and 
concentrations said the sources 
other proposals they outlined would mandate easy access to 
specific weapons depots holding up to a fifth of each sides 
arsenals and simplify surveillance of equipment in units with a low 
level of readiness 
the package is little changed from one that was to be offered two 
weeks ago at the opening fall session of eastwest nonnuclear 
talks which was delayed by squabbling among nato members 
new is the suggestion both sides limit war games to a ceiling of 
several tens of thousands of troops or several hundred battle tanks 
the diplomatic sources said they refused to be more specific about 
the figures 
at the sept 14 session both sides expressed hopes for speedy 
progress toward a treaty reducing conventional forces of both 
military alliances from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains 
soviet chief delegate oleg a grinevsky pledged to get down to 
hard work at the sixweek session on conventional armed forces in 
europe stephen j ledogar his us counterpart welcomed warsaw 
pact agreement to try and reach a draft treaty within a year 
president bush challenged the east bloc to accept that time frame 
in may when he proposed limiting foreignbased us and soviet 
troops to 275000 each bushs package also envisioned slashing 
numbers of military aircraft and other weapons 
nato proposals drawn from bushs speech were presented to the 
warsaw pact at the end of a second round of talks july 13 but the 
soviets and their allies have yet to respond 
stances seem furthest apart on air forces with nato proposing 
each alliance have no more than 5700 combat aircraft and 1900 
helicopter gunships the july 13 initiative also would restrict any 
one country to 3420 combat aircraft and 1140 combat helicopters 
while not presenting specific figures the warsaw pact insists 
combat interceptors based near moscow and the urals be excluded a 
stand nato rejects 
other thresholds proposed by the west would limit each alliance 
to 20000 tanks 16500 artillery pieces and 28000 armored 
personnel carriers 
the warsaw pact has been more vague suggesting overall 
reductions of 10 percent to 15 percent in aircraft and five other 
weapons categories by 1994 that would be followed by a further 25 
percent cut by 1997 with the ultimate goal of purely defensive 
forces by the year 2000 
while the warsaw pact has dropped decades of objections to nato 
claims that it is outmanned and outgunned wide differences continue 
to exist on numbers 
the new nato proposals were not presented during the opening fall 
session after greece voiced a lastminute objection to provisions 
mandating that only maneuvers with 40000 or more reservists and 
1200 or more armed carriers be announced in advance 
athens wary of nato partner turkeys greater military strength 
wanted a lower limit without elaborating the sources said the 
dispute has been papered over 
because of other internal disagreements the nato proposals 
remain purposely vague on how to exchange information on force 
makeup and verification of compliance with an eventual arms treaty 
said the sources 
western negotiators at the 23nation talks have said the united 
states and canada are seeking strict surveillance while their 
european partners object to frequent inspections of their facilities 
by the warsaw pact

doctors treating mother teresa said the 
nobel laureate was getting better wednesday but added it is too 
early to determine whether she is out of danger because of the 
chance of a relapse 
the mother had a comfortable day without chest pains or 
fever said one of her physicians dr ak bardhan 
he said the 79yearold roman catholic nuns temperature was 
normal and she had had no chest pains since monday night 
although her general condition is improving bardhan said mother 
teresa must remain hospitalized for at least two more weeks 
the possibility of a relapse always exists bardhan said 
but if her condition maintains this level of improvement she 
should be out of intensive care in a few days we cannot say she 
is out of danger until another 48 hours have passed 
mother teresa has had intermittent chest pains since she suffered 
a heart attack on sept 8 three days after being admitted to 
woodlands nursing home with a high fever and acute vomiting 
after she leaves the hospital doctors said she will have to 
give up the hectic schedule that earned her a nobel peace prize in 
1979 
despite health problems in recent years the yugoslavborn nun 
has traveled widely to offer care and comfort to the poor and 
suffering 
mother teresa devoted her life to the dying and destitute and 
founded the missionaries of charity in october 1950 to work in the 
slums of calcutta the order now has 3000 nuns working in 87 
countries

the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday endorsed nearly 12 billion in aid for poland and 
hungary far more than president bush has requested after all but 
one of the panels republicans walked out 
sen richard lugar of indiana was the only republican left in the 
room as the committee voted 101 before leaving many of lugars 
gop colleagues denounced the democratic initiative as a politically 
motivated slap at the president 
for their part the democrats said bushs request 100 million 
in development funds for poland and 25 million for hungary spread 
over three years was pathetically timid 
the vote came after raymond seitz assistant secretary of state 
for european affairs testified that while the democrats proposal 
contains all the elements of the presidents proposal the 
administration cannot endorse the higher funding levels 
saying that the surging reform movements in eastern europe are 
something we have hoped for all of our lives seitz told the 
committee it would be the saddest thing if we wrecked it in some 
sort of procedural or partisan wrangle 
lugar told the panel that it was headed for the rocky shoals of 
a partisan debate which is not going to result in anything good for 
the poles 
in my judgment this is an attempt to tweak the administration 
to cause a partisan row on the senate floor that may be interesting 
to watch but the rest of the world is not amused by this kind of 
irresponsibility 
yet the democrats hailed their proposal as a gamble for 
freedom and an urgently needed signal of support to the 
noncommunist reform movements in poland and hungary 
democracy now has an opportunity to prove it can work in 
poland said sen alan cranston dcalif the administration 
proposals are pathetically weak they have fumbled the ball they 
have failed to grasp the historic opportunity that now exists 
the 118 billion democratic aid proposal would authorize 423 
million in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 and 381 million in 
each of the next two years 
the centerpiece of the plan is an annual 300 million 
enterprise fund to support private economic development in 
poland 
the plan also would also authorize spending 75 million in each 
of the next three years to provide a similar fund for hungary 
cranston said democrats propose skimming the money from the 40 
billion spent by the pentagon each year for research and development 
but republicans said the funds bush proposed for poland and 
hungary are sufficient to spur democratic progress and are all that 
can be responsibly provided in a time of severe budget constraints 
you call the president of the united states timid for political 
reasons said sen jesse helms rnc its oneupmanship 
helms expressed the fear that the united states might find itself 
being snookered by the communist parties of eastern europe 
nevertheless some republicans appeared to signal an interest in 
an eventual compromise that would increase aid for poland and 
hungary at some later point 
i would press for a compromise somewhere in between the bush 
plan and the democratic proposal said sen frank murkowski 
ralaska 
and sen gordon humphrey rnh indicated allout support for 
significantly increased aid levels 
the press indicates the president is worried about support for 
this on the right humphrey said frankly im a very 
conservative fellow and id like to see more we may all end up with 
egg on our faces but there may be a window that will close if we do 
not act with imagination and daring 
the opportunity that exists could be the last for a generation 
or two if we dont respond aggressively enough humphrey said

japan is the key to saving the african 
elephant the director of kenyas wildlife conservation said 
wednesday 
if japan has stopped importing ivory the elephants can start 
dancing richard d leakey said in an interview 
japan a leading center for the manufacture of ivory products 
friday announced it would ban imports at least until the end of the 
year most of the worlds ivory comes from the tusks of the african 
elephant 
japan imported 106 tons of ivory last year compared with 143 
tons in 1987 and 475 tons in 1983 
conservationists warn that illegal slaughter could make the 
african elephant extinct in the wild by the mid1990s leakey 
predicted that elephants will one day only live in national parks or 
other reserves 
leakey who wore a necktie with a pattern of skulls is known for 
his research on the first humans 
he made his most important find at the age of 26 on a hillside in 
his native kenya a skull and other bones he judged to be nearly 3 
million years old the discovery provided important evidence about 
the early stages of human development 
the 103 governments that signed the convention on illegal trade 
in endangered species are to meet in lausanne switzerland 
beginning oct 9 a major issue will be whether to switch the 
african elephant from a threatened to an endangered species 
trade is banned in products from endangered species though limited 
exceptions may be granted 
some countries including zimbabwe and south africa may oppose 
the switch on the ground that they are effectively managing their 
own elephant herds so that there should be no objection to their 
sales of ivory 
for south africa thats probably the case for zimbabwe 
probably not leakey said 
leakey praised the united states government which has banned 
ivory imports and the american public for its attitude toward 
buying ivory objects the public attitude is more important than any 
government ban because illegal slaughter has risen only because of 
increased demand he said 
when the people of the world stand up to be counted ivory will 
no longer be sold he said

field testing of genetically modified plants 
and microorganisms will not pose any hazard to the environment 
if done carefully under existing laws a national academy of 
sciences panel concluded in a study released wednesday 
genetically engineered plants and microbes are not 
intrinsically dangerous the study found but the experts said 
field tests should be allowed only after evaluating the effect on 
the environment if the modified organism were to escape from the 
test area 
we feel fairly confident that if this thing is done right it 
will not pose any hazard said robert h burris an emeritus 
professor of biochemistry from the university of wisconsin we 
hope that this will be reassuring to the public 
jeremy rifkin of the foundation on economic trends a longtime 
opponent of field testing of geneticallyaltered organisms attacked 
the report as irresponsible public policy he said science has 
no way to evaluate the risks of releasing such organisms into the 
environment 
burris who was chairman of the academys committee on evaluation 
of introduction of genemodified microorganisms and plants said 
that some 80 modified plants and microbes have been tested in the 
environment and we havent had any accidents as yet 
the committee said that federal agencies reviewing field test 
proposals should base approval on three points how familiar 
scientists are with the modified organism how well the organism 
will be confined or controlled and the probability of adverse 
effects on the environment if the organism were to escape from the 
field test 
science is now able to manipulate basic characteristics of plants 
and bacteria by adding removing or rearranging genes for instance 
a bacteria that resists the formation of ice has been sprayed on 
strawberries to help the plants resist frost some bacteria has been 
experimentally altered so that it would break down pollutants and 
some tomato plant genes have been altered to make the fruit more 
firm 
rifkins organization and some other public advocacy groups 
however have objected that field testing geneticallyaltered 
organisms runs the risk of releasing into the environment a plant or 
bacteria that could cause ecological disaster 
he said some other nations including japan and denmark have put 
a fiveyear moratorium on testing geneticallyaltered organisms 
because of the uncertainty of the risk 
rifkin said the national academy of sciences report is politics 
and not science and added we will oppose these 
recommendations 
burris said however that the committee examined the dangers and 
believes the hazards can be controlled if federal agencies follow 
the threepart guidelines in considering field test applications 
the report said the major environmental risk from genetic 
modification of plants is that an altered plant will escape 
cultivation and become a weed species or that it will pollinate 
wild plants and create a new type of weed 
the likelihood of enhanced weediness is low for genetically 
modified highly domesticated crop plants the report said 
modified microorganisms such as bacteria pose another kind of 
hazard because they are prone to spontaneous mutations suggesting 
the possibility that a damaging organism could developed from one 
that had been manipulated by man 
the report said that such a hazard could be controlled by adding 
to the modified microorganism a suicide gene this would be a 
genetic instruction that would cause the organism to die when it 
encounters a temperature change or is deprived of certain types of 
nutrients 
genetic manipulations of this type the report said could 
guarantee that the organism could not survive outside the target 
environment 
the committee determined that there was no need to change 
existing laws the us department of agriculture and the 
environmental protection agency currently regulate field testing of 
modified organisms 
the laws that exist now are adequate for this said burris 
were not suggesting that any laws be changed 
burris said genetic manipulation of microorganisms and plants has 
great promise for a wide variety of uses 
some manipulated bacteria he said could be used to remove 
sulphur or other undesirable elements from mineral ore leading to a 
concentration of minerals in an ore that might otherwise not be 
economically recovered 
microbes also could be manipulated so that they would eat 
toxic pollutants changing the poisons in chemical dumps for 
example into inert gasses he said 
by manipulating genes agricultural scientists could develop food 
plants that are resistant to insects disease or drought burris 
said

author stephen king said that although a 
high school student who held 11 classmates hostage at gunpoint was 
acting out the scenario of one of his novels books dont cause such 
incidents 
if they didnt do it one way they would do it another way 
he told the bangor daily news crazy is crazy 
king said he knew from the time he watched a television news 
account of mondays classroom standoff in mckee ky that it was a 
case of imitating the plot of rage the novel he wrote in 1977 
under the pen name richard bachman 
it was my story king said adding that he reached that 
conclusion even before it was reported that police had a copy of 
rage in the home of 17yearold dustin pierce the student taken 
into custody after the standoff 
state police and fbi agents also described rage as a 
blueprint for mondays hostagetaking 
but pierce denied tuesday that he was influenced by kings novel 
saying he had never read it 
in kings novel the main character gun in hand takes over his 
classroom in pursuit of what king described as a pathological rage 
fantasy about his father 
police said pierce demanded to talk to his father who he had not 
seen in years 
king said he was grateful no one was injured in mondays standoff 
and that pierce had surrendered peacefully in rage the young 
protagonist kills his teacher and a classmate 
this is not the first time that a king novel has been part of a 
blurred image of reality the bangor resident said he has received 
news clippings about police finding the word redrum near bodies 
of murder victims the word which is murder spelled backward 
appeared in the 1976 novel the shining 
king said his works arent the only ones in which life has 
imitated art

house speaker thomas s foley said wednesday he 
would examine a plan to raise congressional salaries 35 percent but 
many lawmakers looked warily at reviving the unpopular issue 
i dont think the wounds have healed from february said rep 
mike synar dokla recalling the bruising battle for a 51 percent 
pay raise that helped speed the downfall of former speaker jim 
wright dtexas 
rep beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee chuckled that a pay hike could 
pass if its a private vote in the middle of the night 
gop leader robert michel of illinois called any talk of a pay 
raise now just that talk 
the house democratic and republican leadership is expected to 
receive the report from their bipartisan task force on ethics 
thursday a key part of the recommendation is a phaseout of speech 
honoraria coupled with a 35 percent raise for lawmakers over the 
next two years 
senators and representatives now earn 89500 a year except for 
each chambers officers who earn more in addition members of the 
house are allowed to accept honoraria up to 30 percent of their 
salary senators up to 40 percent 
i suppose we will listen to whatever recommendations are made 
among other things questions regarding compensation said 
foley 
here we go off into the valley of death cracked rep pat 
williams dmont who said he could support a modest pay boost if 
it were tied to honoraria elimination talking up front about 35 
percent seems to doom it he added 
foley has said he expects that an elimination of honoraria money 
for speeches that lawmakers take from special interest groups would 
have to be coupled with a pay increase for his colleagues to approve 
it 
he also said that president bushs support would be needed 
there was no immediate white house reaction bush supported that 
51 percent raise proposal earlier this year 
synar said he doubted public sentiment had changed since then 
when the prospect of higher congressional pay drove many 
constituents to write to congress 
at a recent town meeting in his district he said he asked the 
crowd how many favored replacing that dirty filthy 
specialinterest money with a nice clean pay raise for congress 
and not a single hand went up he said 
no the house is not ready to deal with the pay raise said 
rep david nagle diowa

hurricane hugo on wednesday did not 
appear to pose a major threat to this space center but it once 
again delayed a satellite rocket launch and nasa said it was ready 
to move space shuttle atlantis off a launch pad if the storm shifted 
toward the cape 
officials put off from sunday until monday the launch of an 
atlascentaur booster with a navy communications satellite liftoff 
had been set originally for friday but that earlier was put off two 
days after the rockets fuel tank was drained as a hugo precaution 
space agency spokesman george diller said the additional days 
postponement would give launch officials more time to assess hugos 
direction before ordering refueling of the atlascentaur 
were continuing to prepare both the shuttle and the 
atlascentaur for launch but well be ready to take protective 
measures if the storm suddenly turns this way said nasa spokesman 
karl kristofferson 
forecasters said if hugo continued on its present northwest 
course it would pass at least 150 miles east of cape canaveral not 
close enough for its wideranging wind and rain to affect the 
shuttle or the atlascentaur 
to prepare for a possible atlantis move workers parked a giant 
tracked transporter at the base of the launch pad to carry the 
shuttle to the safety of an assembly building the transporter 
moving at maximum speed of 1 mph would take about six hours to 
cover the 42 miles to the building 
atlantis is scheduled to be launched oct 12 with a crew of five 
astronauts who are to send the galileo spacecraft on a sixyear 
journey to the planet jupiter

mayor marion barry apologized wednesday for 
making a vulgar gesture to hecklers at a street festival but 
brushed aside questions on possible damage to his reelection 
campaign 
jesse jackson considered by many a likely rival in the race was 
cheered by the same crowd last sunday democratic national chairman 
ronald brown said tuesday that he expects jackson to run in the 
november 1990 election 
barry said he had spoken wednesday with jackson and he is not 
running however jackson who moved his headquarters to 
washington from chicago this year has not publicly ruled out such 
an effort 
as for barrys gesture with his middle finger the mayor said at 
his monthly news conference when i got there there was a small 
group of people who were cursing calling my wife names calling 
my motherinlaw names and i reacted if i offended some 
people and im sure i did i want to apologize 
when asked whether the incident will hamper his campaign for a 
fourth term barry dismissed the question and refused to answer 
other queries on the matter 
while barry was booed and heckled at sundays gathering jackson 
was greeted with cheers when he was introduced a few moments later 
talk of a jackson candidacy got a further lift when brown 
suggested the twotime democratic presidential hopeful will run 
and if he runs i think he will be elected brown who handled 
jacksons operation at the democratic national convention last year 
said he had no inside information and was just giving his opinion 
when barry was asked about that he said i talked to jesse 
jackson this morning and we talked on sunday night and he knows 
that i am running for mayor and he is not running what other 
people say is their business 
jackson has said he would never run against his old civil rights 
colleague but he has left open the possibility of a bid for the 
office if barry dropped out 
the mayor has testified twice to a grand jury that is part of a 
federal drug probe of former barry associate and city employee 
charles lewis 
published reports have said lewis has told prosecutors he and 
barry used cocaine together during a visit barry paid to the virgin 
islands in early 1988 and during a trip by lewis to washington last 
december 
the federal probe began after reports that city police called off 
an attempt to make an undercover drug buy from lewis last december 
when they learned that barry was in lewis downtown washington hotel 
room 
the mayor has acknowledged visiting lewis room on several 
occasions but has repeatedly denied he saw used or purchased drugs

subway gunman bernhard goetz was out from behind 
bars wednesday for the first time since january but due in court 
next week for the 50 million lawsuit filed by the one of the young 
men he shot nearly five years ago 
his 1201 am release from jail ended one chapter in the highly 
publicized case which began dec 22 1984 when goetz fled 
manhattan after shooting four teenagers on a subway train leaving 
one paralyzed from the waist down 
this morning goetz walked out of prison darrell cabey will 
never walk out of his prison ron kuby an attorney for the 
paralyzed 23yearold said wednesday darrell gets no time off for 
good behavior no parole no appeal and its that way for the rest 
of his life 
goetz who spent 250 days in jail after his jan 13 sentencing 
left through a side door avoiding eight camera crews and 30 
reporters and photographers gathered at the front door jail 
officials said 
neither supporters nor demonstrators turned out for the release 
of goetz who became a folk hero to some and a symbol of racism to 
others after the shooting 
goetz who is white claimed the four young black men were about 
to rob him the teenagers said they were panhandling for change to 
play video games 
a police officer drove the 41yearold goetz away from the jail 
and he arrived at his apartment early wednesday dodging 
photographers as he entered the building phone calls to his 
apartment went unanswered through the day 
goetz whiled away much of his time in jail playing chess with 
inmates in an 18cell protective custody block ruby ryles a 
spokeswoman for the city correction department said others in the 
block included convicted child killer joel steinberg and joseph 
fama the alleged triggerman in the bensonhurst racial attack 
goetz said before his release that he might leave new york city 
to escape the constant attention his presence generates 
for the past 4 years he has been a prisoner of the media 
perhaps its time for bernhard goetz to be left alone said his 
attorney barry slotnick fortunately this episode in his life is 
closed and its time that he be left alone 
but his reclusiveness will end sept 29 when goetz is scheduled 
to give a deposition in the cabey lawsuit said kuby 
im going to try to open it up to the public theres no reason 
for it to be closed and theres certainly public interest said 
kuby depositions although a part of the public record usually are 
done in private 
slotnick would not comment wednesday on the civil lawsuit he and 
cocounsel mark baker had tried unsuccessfully to cut goetzs 
oneyear sentence taking his case all the way to the us supreme 
court 
goetz was convicted of illegal gun possession on june 16 1987 
by a jury that acquitted him of four counts of attempted murder and 
assault

the speaker of the hungarian parliament said 
wednesday that his country would like to eventually withdraw from 
the warsaw pact and become neutral he urged the united states to 
hasten economic aid to help that process along 
matyas szuros a leader of the reformist wing of hungarys ruling 
communist party also said his nation was structuring its economic 
and political reforms in such a way that if the reforms espoused by 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev fail hungarys changes would not 
be rolled back 
in a conversation with several reporters at the hungarian 
embassy szuros said he had told administration officials like 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft that hungary would like the nato and warsaw 
pacts to become political rather than military blocs 
once that happens hungary which is currently a member of the 
sevennation soviet bloc alliance would leave its not right now 
that we want to leave but within a decade or so he said 
hungary would like a status of neutrality with international 
guarantees such as the model adopted by finland and austria after 
world war ii szuros said the basis of neutrality must be 
prepared gradually without losing touch with reality he 
cautioned 
szuros indicated he did ot think the soviet union would block 
such a move if it were done in a measured way 
the hungarian process is getting more and more independent from 
the soviet union but its only natural that the soviet union is an 
important hinterland for us he said 
just as hungary would like the soviet reforms to succeed so 
gorbachev wants the hungarian moves toward democracy to bear fruit 
the speaker said 
but we are striving to create conditions under which failure 
in the soviet union would not divert us in our way he said 
szuros predicted that czechoslovakia one of the most repressive 
communist societies would undertake reform and the expected 
leadership change in east germany could also lead to liberalization 
but romania is a rather dark nepoticstic dictatorship and no 
movement should be expected there soon he said 
hungarys move toward a multiparty democracy including general 
elections scheduled for next year cannot succeed without western 
help szuros said 
until recently the bush administration had adopted a 
waitandsee attitude of making future us aid conditional on 
full implementation of democratic change he said 
but from his conversations with officials here szuros said he 
got the impression the united states is now aware of the urgency of 
hungarys needs 
in a reference to the dispute between democrats and republicans 
over the levels of us aid for hungary szuros said hungary had 
become part of internal policy debates in the united states 
im glad to see this interest in my country he said with a 
laugh but i hope the result will be constructive 
as he spoke the senate foreign relations committee voted for a 
democratic plan to aid poland and hungary with nearly 12 billion 
over three years far more than that proposed by president bush 
whom democrats accused of missing a historic opportunity to champion 
reform in the communist world 
republicans accusing democrats of playing politics on the issue 
walked out before the 101 vote warning that the partisan wrangling 
could endanger the future of us aid to the eastern bloc nations 
szuros said that what his country needs most are favorable 
trading arrangements with the united states liberalized credits to 
help ease its foreign debt an easing of limitations on technology 
transfers and investment by american entrepreneurs

a plan to put the heatdamaged reactor at 
the three mile island nuclear power plant into longterm storage 
does not threaten the environment the staff of the nuclear 
regulatory commission has concluded 
the staff released its final environmental impact statement on 
the postdefueling monitored storage plan nrc senior project 
manager michael masik said wednesday 
the staff is now working on evaluating the plans safety and a 
hearing may be held sometime next year before any nrc final vote 
masik said 
tmi unit 2 was damaged in march 1979 in the worst accident ever 
at a us commercial nuclear power plant a combination of operator 
and mechanical errors led to loss of cooling water and over half of 
the radioactive uranium fuel core melted radioactive gas escaped to 
the atmosphere 
fuel removal will be completed next month said doug bedell a 
spokesman for the plant operator gpu nuclear corp 
less than 1 percent of the fuel will remain in hardtoreach 
places but will not pose any hazard the company has said 
under gpus longterm plan the reactor containment building will 
be closed and monitored for 20 to 30 years by a staff of about 50 
people 
all water will be removed from the plant and lighting and 
ventilation will be maintained bedell said 
the nrc reviewed nine alternatives including no further action 
immediate dismantling and longterm storage the only option not 
acceptable to the nrc staff was taking no further action 
gpu nuclear favors storage because it will allow time for natural 
decay of high radiation levels in the plants basement and because 
more immediate steps to dismantle the plant could expose workers to 
higher doses bedell said 
he also said the company felt it wasnt prudent to start knocking 
down a building with 4foot thick concrete walls on the same site as 
an operating nuclear power plant the undamaged tmi unit 1

a radical shiite group today claimed responsibility 
for the downing of a french dc10 jetliner over a desolate stretch 
of northern africa in which all 171 people aboard were killed the 
airline uta said 
the airline said a bomb most likely caused the crash of the 
jetliner which exploded in the sky tuesday shortly after taking off 
from chad for paris uta said it received an anonymous call from a 
man claiming responsibility for the crash on behalf of the moslem 
terrorist group islamic jihad 
the airline said it was not in a position to judge its 
authenticity and informed the french foreign ministry 
the wreckage of the aircraft was found today scattered widely 
across the rocky sandy and remote section of southcentral niger 
later today an unidentified man telephoned a western news agency 
in london and read a statement in english said to be from islamic 
jihad the statement linked the crash to israels capture of a 
shiite moslem cleric sheik abdulkarim obeid in southern lebanon 
on july 28 
in the name of allah and imam khomeini the islamic jihad 
issued this statement we are proud of this action which was very 
successful we would like to say the french are warned not to 
exchange information regarding sheik obeid with the israelis no 
more we demand the freedom of sheik obeid and otherwise we will 
refresh the memories of the bombings in paris of 85 and 86 long 
live the islamic republic of iran he said 
french army soldiers stationed in neighboring chad were the first 
to reach the crash site they said all 15 crew members and 156 
passengers including eight children died in the crash the 
passengers included the wife of the american ambassador to chad and 
a member of the chadian cabinet 
the us national transportation safety board said today that it 
was sending a team of us investigators to help determine the cause 
of the crash 
contact was lost with the parisbound jet less than an hour after 
it took off tuesday from the capital of chad ndjamena after 
originating in the congo 
it exploded at high altitude leaving every reason to believe 
it was a bomb uta airline spokesman michel friess said on french 
television he said it was possible but less likely that a 
technical failure was to blame 
it appears to have exploded in flight at high altitude said 
a foreign ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the pieces are widely scattered so it didnt crash on impact 
islamic jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in 
lebanon presumed to be part of hezbollah the iranfinanced 
guerrilla group that is believed to hold most of the 16 western 
hostages in lebanon including eight americans 
on dec 21 a new yorkbound pan am jumbo jet exploded over 
lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the 
ground 
investigators said a bomb disguised in a radiocassette player 
was put aboard flight 103 in a suitcase at frankfurt where the 
flight originated investigators also said the main suspect in the 
bombing is an arab terrorist group the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command 
on march 10 1984 a bomb exploded on a uta dc8 flying the same 
route just before the plane was to take off from ndjamena injuring 
25 people on board an otherwise unknown group calling itself 
group idriss miskini claimed responsibility but the chadian 
government blamed libya for the bombing 
chad fought with libyanbacked rebels for more than a decade but 
the situation has been calm for the past two years and chad and 
libya recently signed an agreement to settle their border dispute 
peacefully 
among the passengers who boarded in ndjamena was bonnie pugh 
wife the us ambassador to chad robert l pugh the us embassy 
in chad said 
the french news agency agence francepresse quoting unidentified 
sources said chadian planning minister mahamat soumahila was also 
on the plane headed for the annual meeting of the international 
monetary fund in washington 
most passengers appeared to be french chadian and congolese 
said the foreign ministry spokesman 
there were 156 passengers and 15member crew on board the 
airline said a uta spokeswoman declined to say when it would 
release a passenger list 
the wreckage was found shortly after dawn by a transall aircraft 
sent by the french military contingent in ndjamena the chadian 
capital 
the defense ministry said the wreckage was spread over a wide 
rocky and sandy area in the termit mountains north of lake chad 
french military spokesmen said twinengine puma helicopters were 
being dispatched from ndjamena with medical crews for immediate aid 
to survivors if any are found the transport ministry said it also 
was sending investigators 
uta said contact was lost with flight 772 less than an hour after 
it took off from ndjamena after a stopover on a flight that 
originated in brazzaville capital of the congo 
the airline said the last radio contact between the plane and air 
traffic controllers indicated everything was normal it reported no 
unusual weather 
uta purchased the aircraft in 1973 and it had logged 60000 hours 
in the air uta said the plane was in excellent condition civil 
aviation authorities in france said the plane had cf650 engines 
made by general electric 
the plan disappeared just hours after the us federal aviation 
administration ordered a detailed inspection of the fan disks of 220 
cf66 engines built by general electric for the dc10 
an explosion in the tail engine of a united airlines dc10 on 
july 19 severed hydraulic lines operating the airplanes controls 
forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing near sioux city 
iowa in which 112 people died 
faa administrator james b busey and national transportation 
safety board chairman james kolstad subsequently declared the dc10 
to be safe

barbara bush on wednesday helped the national 
cancer institute launch a national breast cancer awareness campaign 
urging all women 40 and older to have regular mammograms 
the presidents wife asked these women to pick up the phone and 
make a lifesaving appointment for a mammogram 
breast cancer strikes one in 10 american women it is the leading 
type of cancer among women in the united states and is second only 
to lung cancer in cancer deaths among american women 
this year breast cancer will be diagnosed in 142000 women in 
the united states and will cause 43000 deaths according to the 
american cancer society 
mrs bush called on about 200 leaders of womens community and 
business groups attending the womens leadership summit on 
mammography to get the word out about early detection of breast 
cancer and the need for regular mammograms 
the cancer institute recommends that women with no symptoms have 
a mammogram every one to two years and a clinical breast exam every 
year beginning at age 40 after age 50 all women should have both 
exams annually the cancer institute says women with a family 
history of breast cancer should consult with their doctor about the 
frequency of exams 
deaths from breast cancer could be reduced by at least 30 percent 
if all women 40 and over had regular mammograms said louis 
sullivan secretary of the department of health and human services 
a 1987 survey shows that only 17 percent of us women age 40 and 
older had had a mammogram in the previous year and only 37 percent 
of all women in this age group had ever had a mammogram said samuel 
broder director of the cancer institute 
beginning jan 1 1990 medicare will cover mammography tests 
every two years for women 65 and over for women eligible for 
medicare because of disability mammography will be covered annually 
for those 50 to 64 and for those 40 to 49 who are at high risk of 
developing breast cancer and every two years for those 40 to 49 not 
at high risk one mammography exam will be covered for women 35 to 
40 
legislation introduced in the house this week by rep barbara 
vucanovich rnev would require state medicaid plans to provide 
coverage of mammograms under the same schedule as in the medicare 
regulations it also would change the medicare law to provide

a us team will help investigate the downing 
of a dc10 that french uta airline officials say exploded over 
northern africa killing all 171 people on board 
airline officials said the plane apparently was brought down 
tuesday by a bomb but they didnt rule out the possibility of a 
mechanical failure 
seven americans were aboard including bonnie pugh wife of the 
us ambassador to chad robert l pugh the wreckage was scattered 
over a wide area in a rugged part of niger 
representives of the national transportation safety board the 
federal aviation administration and builders of the plane and 
engines mcdonnell douglas and general electric were to leave late 
wednesday for niger said ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewisc 
us investigators are routinely sent to assist in the 
investigation of crashes in other countries when they involve 
usbuilt jetliners lopatkiewisc said 
in separate telephone calls to the airline and to a western news 
agency a caller claiming to represent the moslem extremist group 
islamic jihad claimed responsibility for downing the plane 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the government 
had offered its assistance to france and chad 
the obvious widespread nature of the debris suggested it blew 
up in the sky and not on the ground fitzwater said adding that 
president bush had been briefed on the mishap 
the faa on wednesday announced 630000 in fines against pan 
american world airways for alleged security violations related to 
another flight downed by a bomb pan am flight 103 that exploded 
dec 21 over lockerbie scotland killing 270 people 
the faa accused the airline of failing to properly screen 
passengers and cargo before the flights departure from airports in 
frankfurt west germany and london 
also wednesday the house authorized 270 million for modern 
security equipment at many us and foreign airports 
the legislation approved 39231 orders a wide array of security 
measures and would require commuter airlines for the first time to 
screen passengers and their carryon luggage 
the disappearance of the french plane on a flight from chad to 
paris came a few hours after a congressional hearing in washington 
at which the top officials of the faa the safety board and 
mcdonnell douglas gave assurances that dc10s are structurally safe 
us participation in the investigation lopatkiewisc said is 
not related to increased concern over the dc10 after the july 19 
crashlanding of a united airlines dc10 that killed 112 people at 
sioux city iowa 
that crash has been blamed on an explosive engine failure that 
cut off hydraulic flight controls 
lopatkiewisc said investigators would be looking for anything 
they can learn about the aircraft safety board representatives 
going to the site included chief investigator barry trotter and an 
airliner structural specialist 
the investigation will be led by french or niger authorities 
the faa on tuesday ordered inspections of 220 general 
electricbuilt dc10 engines such as those used on the iowa plane to 
look for microscopic defects that officials say could have led to 
cracking of the engines fan disk 
mcdonnell douglas also has recommended additions of valves to 
hydraulic lines in all dc10s that would prevent pilots from losing 
all steering control when the lines are cut

the american civil liberties union asked state 
superior court to overrule a judges order barring a 26yearold 
woman from having an abortion because her boyfriend said he wants to 
raise the baby 
the aclu filed its request tuesday in pittsburgh after blair 
county judge norm calan ruled in altoona in favor of the womans 
boyfriend 
marion damick associate director of the aclu in pittsburgh said 
wednesday the organization will represent the woman in arguing that 
calan overstepped the law monday in issuing the preliminary 
injunction 
calan said he the abortion laws unsettled and he preferred to err 
on the side of the fetus 
the us supreme court ruled in 1976 that states cannot give 
husbands veto power over their pregnant wives decisions to have 
abortions and lower courts have applied the ruling to unmarried 
couples 
in keeping with the supreme court ruling pennsylvania has no law 
to support calans ruling according to the aclu and the national 
abortion rights action league

bonn west germany more than 800 east germans still are 
flooding to the west every day foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher reported on wednesday 
the west german government urged east bloc leaders to be 
pragmatic about the exodus and an east german politician asked for 
reforms to stop children of the revolution from fleeing 
genscher said the refugee crisis has set off an emotional wave 
affecting the whole world government spokesman hans klein 
reported 
klein told reporters the rush of east germans escaping through 
hungary continued with 416 new arrivals in west germany in the 24 
hours ending noon wednesday 
he said an additional 400 east germans with permission to 
emigrate have been arriving in west germany daily over the past few 
days 
more than 17500 east germans have come to west germany through 
hungary in the past 10 days swelling the emigration tide through 
midseptember to the 100000 mark earlier predicted for the entire 
year 
as many as 200000 are expected to get to west germany this year 
a record of legal emigration and refugees since the berlin wall was 
built in 1961 
most refugees are young families fleeing economic stagnation and 
a stalinist political system that east berlins leaders refuse to 
change despite reforms sweeping the communist world 
manfred gerlach deputy leader of the liberal democrats aligned 
with the east german communist party on wednesday suggested some 
rethinking 
we must ask ourselves why they are resigning these who are 
mostly children of the revolution raised and politically educated 
here gerlach wrote in the party daily der morgen 
his comments were the first by an influential politician to 
suggest changes but his calls were vague and his support for a 
socialist government unwavering 
the main east german party newspaper neues deutschland ignored 
gerlachs commentary it has accused bonn of luring east german 
citizens westward and has defended the policies of ailing erich 
honecker the 77yearold communist leader 
bonns embassies in eastern europe are sheltering about 650 other 
east germans demanding to emigrate 
at a cabinet meeting wednesday the government called on east 
bloc leaderships to seek pragmatic and humanitarian resolution 
to the exodus klein told reporters 
genscher presided over the meeting in the absence of chancellor 
helmut kohl who is recovering from prostate surgery kohl received 
a telegram from president bush on wednesday wishing him a speedy 
recovery klein said 
he said kohl talked with cabinet members by telephone 
the cabinet also asked czechoslovakia to stop impeding east 
germans with legal travel documents for hungary several refugees 
have accused prague authorities of trying to do this 
foreign ministry spokesman juergen chrobog said bonn is trying to 
resolve the problem through diplomatic channels 
it is much easier for east germans to obtain travel permission to 
hungary than authorization to emigrate many of those arriving in 
west germany used the escape route that became available in may when 
budapest took down barbedwire fences on its border with austria 
east germans can travel freely to czechoslovakia and hundreds 
have escaped across to hungary to make their way west 
newspaper reports said 520 east germans are at the west german 
embassy in prague seeking bonns help in emigrating 
czechoslovak barriers have prompted some east germans to try 
risky escapes 
refugees told west german tv wednesday they swam across the 
danube river to reach hungary one man said he was kept from 
crossing to hungary so he went to poland then flew to budapest 
those interviewed were not further identified 
chrobog said 16 of 120 east germans who took refuge in bonns 
warsaw embassy were moved to a nearby roman catholic seminary since 
west germany had to close the cramped embassy to the public on 
tuesday 
bonns ambassador to poland franzjoachim schoeller told west 
german tv tuesday that poland has promised a pragmatic solution 
for the refugees 
the newspaper bild said polands new government led by 
noncommunists assured bonn no east german refugees will returned 
home against their will

a federal judge wednesday sentenced a 
turkish national to a life term in federal prison for conspiring 
with a fort stewart warrant officer to commit espionage against the 
united states 
judge b avant edenfield also ordered that huseyin meister 
yildirim 61 of belleair beach fla be banished from the united 
states never to return if he ever wins parole 
yildirim was convicted july 20 of scheming with james w hall an 
intelligence analyst in the g2 section of the 24th infantry 
division at fort stewart to sell military intelligence to east 
german and soviet agents 
yildirim who did not testify at his trial told edenfield in a 
rambling statement wednesday that he was innocent and had acted on 
behalf of america 
in the reality i am not guilty i protected america 
yildirim said 
edenfield rejected pleas by yildirim and his courtappointed 
lawyers that his sentence be comparable to that given hall by a 
military court 
hall admitted his role in the espionage scheme and was sentenced 
by a military judge to 40 years in prison he will be eligible for 
parole in 10 years 
the only proper sentence for mr hall would have been death at 
a firing squad edenfield said mr hall did not get justice 
prosecutors contended that from 1982 to 1988 yildirim carried 
classified military intelligence from hall to east bloc agents and 
returned with money 
according to evidence hall had access to all levels of 
intelligence during tours at the armys field station berlin

of this century 
the simmons school adopted for refurbishment by residents was

the school closed in 1906 and has been used for storage on the 
family farm ever since the couple donated the school to the flat 
rockhawcreek school corp for fixing up 
we want it as a part of our school site as the focal point of 
the school complex superintendent glen keller said 
the 125ton school was so wide it crossed both sides of a state

the agriculture department said wednesday the 
financial condition of farmers continues to improve from the crunch 
of the mid1980s 
recent surveys show that farm bankruptcy filings in 1988 were 
down 50 percent from 1986 the peak year for the decade the 
departments economic research service said in a preliminary report 
despite the 1980s farm financial crisis farm numbers fell less 
than in preceding decades the report said farm numbers 
declined by 266600 per year on the average during 198089 
compared with 17 million in the 1950s 1 million in the 1960s and 
516000 in the 1970s 
the brief analysis was in a summary of the october issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine to be issued later this month 
greg gajewski the magazines economics editor said the 
summarys account did not portray fully however the impact of the 
decline in farm numbers during the 1980s 
there were proportionately more of the large commercial farms 
that went out of business in the 80s than in the earlier decades 
gajewski said in a telephone interview 
but the peak of financial stress for farmers collectively has 
passed he said there are still exceptions including many who are 
having problems repaying loans made by the departments farmers home 
administration 
others with debts to commercial banks and the farm credit system 
are faring much better than they were a few years ago 
the report also said that 1989 net cash income of farmers is 
still expected to decline 5 percent to 13 percent from last years 
record of 599 billion that was unchanged from the forecast a 
month ago 
higher expenses associated with larger crop plantings are major 
factors in the expected decline in cash income this year also 
federal payments to farmers will be lower 
net cash income is the amount of gross cash income generated by 
farmers during the calendar year minus cash operating expenses it 
includes the sales of inventory stocks build up over previous years 
last years drought helped push up 1988 net cash income as 
farmers sold accumulated inventories at higher prices 
another measure used by the agency is net farm income 
accounting which measures the value of the current years 
production plus government payments minus total costs allowances 
also are made for the value of family dwellings and other factors 
by this method net farm income could rise 5 percent to 16 
percent this year to a range of 48 billion to 53 billion from 
457 billion in 1988 also unchanged from the august forecast

president bush has been so slow in staffing key 
positions in his administration that serious questions arise as to 
whether the bush administration will ever reach full strength a 
report by house democrats said wednesday 
eight months after his inauguration bush has yet to fill 55 
percent of the top jobs in government according to the report by 
the house democratic study group 
as of sept 18 the report said bush has made known his choices 
to fill 178 of the top jobs in us departments and agencies 
but it said 219 positions representing 55 percent of the total 
remained vacant 
while the number of nominees submitted to the senate for 
confirmation in the 40 days before sept 18 grew from 60 to 68 
the principal problem remained the inability of the white house to 
make nominations the report said 
the pace of recent presidential nominations does little to cut 
into the enormous number of remaining vacancies the report said 
it raises serious questions as to whether the bush 
administration will ever reach full strength the report said 
since 1961 it said presidential appointees have on average 
remained in their jobs for 18 to 20 months 
thus in an average month about 5 percent of the topranked jobs 
became open it said 
since aug 9 the bush administration has made 12 appointments 
per month equal to about 3 percent of the total number of 
appointive jobs the report said 
in other words the current rate of appointments is not even 
sufficient to maintain stability in executive branch staffing over a 
full fouryear term

richard ramirez was found guilty of multiple 
murder counts today from a list of 43 verdicts returned by jurors 
who agreed ramirez was the devil worshiping night stalker who 
terrorized southern california during the summer of 1985 
readings of the verdicts were delayed when ramirez asked to be 
excused he was led from the courtroom to a cell one floor below 
where he reportedly listened to the rulings via remote loudspeaker 
ramirez a 29yearold drifter from el paso texas is accused of 
13 murders and a series of assaults that terrified los angeles in 
the summer of 1985 
the prosecution claimed ramirez is the night stalker who left 
symbols of demon worship at some murder scenes and gouged out one 
victims eyes 
the defense claimed that ramirez was a victim of mistaken 
identity 
superior court judge michael tynan agreed at the outset of 
deliberations to give attorney daniel hernandez six hours to fly 
from his home for the verdict 
the jury which considered 13 murder and 30 felony charges had 
to restart deliberations twice once when a juror was dismissed for 
napping and again when a member of the panel was slain by her

the senate armed services committee on 
wednesday unanimously approved gen colin l powell president 
bushs nominee to head the joint chiefs of staff 
the panel voted 200 to recommend the nomination to the full 
senate if confirmed the 52yearold powell would be the first 
black and the youngest officer to hold the nations top military job 
the committee decision followed nearly three hours of a 
confirmation hearing in which powell told congress that cuts in the 
bush administrations budget request for various weapons programs 
could undermine a ussoviet pact on reducing strategic arms 
powell who served as president reagans national security 
adviser told lawmakers that political changes in the soviet union 
should not lead to cuts in the star wars program landbased nuclear 
missiles or the b2 stealth bomber 
the house bill that cuts 502 million from the administrations 
11 billion request for the multiplewarhead railgarrison mx 
missile and eliminates all 100 million earmarked for the 
singlewarhead truckmobile midgetman would completely unhinge 
our start negotiating position powell said 
his remarks came one day after secretary of state james a baker 
iii announced a shift in the us position on the landbased 
missiles the administration will no longer insist on elimination of 
mobile missiles according to baker who conceded the position has 
complicated negotiations 
the soviets have two mobile missiles while the administration is 
asking congress to fund the mx and midgetman 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will meet with 
bush on thursday before traveling to wyoming for sessions with baker 
this weekend 
during nearly three hours of questioning powell told the 
committee that scaling back the program to build 130 stealth 
bombers considered the most expensive plane in history at 530 
million a copy would force the united states to go rethink its 
position 
if there is no b2 we have essentially started a phaseout 
without the b2 we no longer have the same start position that 
we did for the last several years and i believe it most unlikely 
that there will be a treaty up here to ratify he said 
we would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate a 
different type of treaty 
on other issues powell said 
he supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and in 
response to terrorist attacks 
cuts in troops in south korea europe and other overseas posts 
in response to the growing sentiment in congress for us allies to 
share more of the defense burden should not be done unilaterally 
powell said he was very hesitant to do it to satisfy current 
budget demands 
powell a decorated veteran of two combat tours in vietnam is 
commander of the army forces command in fort macpherson ga he was 
hailed by democrat albert gore jr of tennessee and republican pete 
wilson of california as likely the best appointment made by bush 
if confirmed by the full senate powell would succeed adm 
william j crowe jr who is retiring sept 30

a moslem extremist group claimed responsibility 
wednesday for the downing of a french dc10 jetliner in southern 
niger that killed all 171 people on board 
us french and uta airline authorities said they believe the 
plane bound tuesday from chad to paris was blown out of the sky by 
a bomb a us team of investigators was to leave later wednesday 
for niger 
two callers who claimed to represent islamic jihad but did not 
give their own names made their claims of responsibility in separate 
telephone calls to the airline and to a western news agency 
islamic jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups in 
lebanon believed to be part of hezbollah or party of god the 
umbrella groups thought to hold 16 westerners hostage in lebanon 
including eight americans 
hezbollah was at the center of a hostage crisis earlier this 
summer when israeli forces in southern lebanon kidnapped a group 
member shiite moslem religious leader sheik abdulkarim obeid 
three days after the july 28 abduction of obeid the proiranian 
organization of the oppressed on earth claimed it retaliated by 
hanging us marine lt col william r higgins abducted while on 
un duty in lebanon doubt has been cast on claims higgins was 
hanged or whether he died earlier 
among the passengers on the french jetliner were seven americans 
including bonnie pugh wife of the us ambassador to chad robert 
l pugh 
uta flight 772 was on a flight from brazzaville congo to paris 
when it crashed tuesday shortly after making a stop in ndjamena 
chad debris was scattered over a 16mile expanse of desert about 
400 miles northwest of ndjamena 
the french army whose troops stationed in neighboring chad were 
the first to reach the scene said the 15 crew and 156 passengers 
died including eight children 
authorities said indications are that the aircraft was felled by 
a bomb 
it exploded at high altitude leaving every reason to believe it 
was a bomb said uta spokesman michel friesse he said it was 
possible but less likely the explosion was due to technical 
failure 
a foreign ministry spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
echoed that sentiment the pieces are widely scattered so it 
didnt crash on impact 
the obvious widespread nature of the debris suggested it blew 
up in the sky and not on the ground presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said adding that president bush had been briefed 
on the mishap 
representives of the national transportation safety board the 
federal aviation administration and builders of the plane and 
engines mcdonnell douglas and general electric were to leave 
wednesday night for niger said ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewisc 
us investigators are routinely sent to assist in the 
investigation of crashes in other countries when they involve 
usbuilt jetliners lopatkiewisc said 
uta said it had received an anonymous phone call from a man 
claiming responsibility on behalf of islamic jihad 
in london an anonymous caller also telephoned a western news 
agency and said 
in the name of allah and imam khomeini the islamic jihad 
issued this statement we are proud of this action which was very 
successful we would like to say the french are warned not to 
exchange information regarding sheik obeid with the israelis no 
more we demand the freedom of sheik obeid and otherwise we will 
refresh the memories of the bombings in paris of 85 and 86 long 
live the islamic republic of iran 
the ministry of transport sent four investigators from the civil 
aviation authority to the scene of the crash the authority said 
military helicopters had reached the site and found debris scattered 
over 16 miles of desert 
cargo aircraft made fuel drops at the desolate site so the 
helicopters could refuel for the return flight 
the dc10 which went into service in may 1973 took off from 
ndjamena on the fivehour flight to paris the plane made a last 
contact with the ndjamena airport control tower about 40 to 50 
minutes after it took off uta said the crew did not indicate any 
trouble 
the wreckage of the plane was found at daylight wednesday by a 
french military aircraft 
chadian authorities said 77 passengers boarded the plane in 
brazzaville and 79 during the stop in ndjamena 
security is considered tight at the ndjamena airport and access 
to planes is restricted to passengers the brazzaville airport also 
restricts access but does not routinely check luggage 
on march 10 1984 a bomb exploded aboard a uta dc8 flying the 
same route just before the plane was to take off from ndjamena 
twentyfive people were injured 
a group calling itself group idriss miskini claimed 
responsibility but the chadian government blamed libya with whom 
it had been fighting a war in the north for the bombing 
on dec 21 a new yorkbound pan am jumbo jet exploded over 
lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the 
ground investigators said a bomb disguised in a radiocassette 
player was put aboard flight 103 
investigators also have said the main suspect in the lockerbie 
bombing is an arab terrorist group the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command 
uta which said the aircraft had logged 60000 hours in the air 
said the plane was in excellent condition civil aviation 
authorities in france said the plane had cf650 engines made by 
general electric 
the plane disappeared just hours after the us federal aviation 
administration ordered a detailed inspection of the fan disks of 220 
cf66 engines built by general electric for the dc10 
an explosion in the tail engine of a united airlines dc10 on 
july 19 severed hydraulic lines operating the airplanes controls 
forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing near sioux city 
iowa in which 112 people died 
faa administrator james b busey and national transportation 
safety board chairman james kolstad subsequently declared the dc10 
to be safe

test equipment used by the air force to 
determine the effectiveness of radarwarning receivers and other 
electronics on tactical fighters has been faulty and unreliable 
says a report released wednesday 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
said the problems with the test equipment undermine the combat 
readiness of the aircraft and the ability of the planes to fly 
combat missions 
the aircraft are equipped with electronic warfare systems 
consisting of a radarwarning receiver that alerts the pilot when 
his airplane is being tracked by enemy radar and a jammer that 
transmits signals to deceive enemy radar 
specifically the study found that at five tactical units in the 
united states europe and asia almost half of about 455 jammers the 
air force deemed ready for combat had undetected defects 
the cost for this kind of carelessness can be staggering 
said rep john conyers jr dmich the chairman of the house 
government operations subcommittee on legislation and national 
security and the risk it poses to our national security and to 
the lives of our pilots is simply unacceptable 
conyers subcommittee had requested the gao report 
the study attributed the problems to the air forces acquisition 
process in one instance the air force purchased 72 test sets at a 
cost of 272 million before testing them 
the air force has not adhered to policies requiring that test 
equipment be developed and deployed simultaneously with electronic 
warfare systems the gao said to deploy the warfare systems as 
quickly as possible the air force has not taken steps to assure 
that the electronic warfare system can be adequately maintained in 
an operational environment 
the air forces strategy may result in additional cost and will 
continue to place combat readiness at risk 
the report also said that the air force is relying on its 
contractors to keep its electronic warfare systems operating 
according to the gao in one year contractor technicians made 60 
percent of all repairs at one tactical unit in asia in europe at 
another unit contractor technicians made 40 percent of the repairs 
the price tag an average annual cost of 154000 to 215000 for 
each technician 
defense department officials told the gao that they had used 
the strategy of concurrent development and production of electronic 
warfare systems to expedite fielding of the systems 
they pentagon officials said the fielding of test equipment 
has lagged behind deployment of new electronic warfare systems 
the gao said 
the air force declined comment on the report until it had 
reviewed the study said capt susan strednansky of the air force

the bush administration announced wednesday it 
would support major overhaul of catastrophic medical care for 
retirees to stave off repeal of the new medicare program 
we want to do everything we can to preserve the core benefits 
in the program louis sullivan secretary of health and human 
services told the senate finance committee repeal would be a big 
mistake 
sullivan said specifically that the administration would support 
a plan recommended by senate leaders of both parties that would 
repeal coverage for most prescription drugs and significantly reduce 
the income surtax that pays for most of the program that plan would 
scale back reimbursement for physicians fees but would retain full 
coverage of hospital costs 
the committee could vote on that proposal thursday 
nearly two dozen times during a 90minute session sullivan 
repeated that the administration prefers that the catastrophic care 
program be kept intact nevertheless he said that i recognize you 
have been under tremendous pressure from throughout the country 
and that some changes are inevitable 
congress has been receiving heaps of mail from older americans 
who oppose one or more parts of the programs much of the mail is 
from federal retirees who already have a governmentpaid 
catastrophic care program and dont want another complaints also 
are pouring in from higherincome retirees who object to the surtax 
which applies only to them 
as a result there is strong sentiment in congress to repeal the 
program outright although bentsen opposes such action he told 
reporters that the house seems certain to vote for repeal 
bentsen and some colleagues have complained that the 
administrations handsoff policy has allowed the president to avoid 
facing the issue and to dump the whole problem into congresss lap 
after failing to attend a finance committee session tuesday 
sullivan showed up wednesday and promised administration backing for 
any amendments that represented good health policy that did not 
worsen the budget deficit and that were politically stable 
at least two members of the finance committee sens william 
roth rdel and john c danforth rmo want to repeal the 
program danforth said that the nation should look at all its health 
needs and set priorities before rushing into a major new health 
program 
sen bill bradley dnj said any discussion of repeal should 
include recognition that peoples lives are at stake repeal he 
said would amount to denying someboey the right to get an 
operation in a hospital and allow them to live without going 
bankrupt

jacquesyves cousteau says hes glad his 
undersea explorations have led never him to a treasure ship and if 
they did he wouldnt admit it 
the famed french explorer and captain of the research vessel 
calypso was asked at a national press club appearance if he ever 
thought he had gotten into the wrong profession in light of a 
pending salvage operation off the coast of the carolinas in which 
that crew hopes to recover up to 1 billion in sunken booty 
cousteau who has discovered more than his share of natural 
treasures under the sea fished a penny out of his pocket and 
declared absolutely not 
first of all id lose my crew because they would all want a 
share he laughed 
cousteau then explained that france requires its citizens to 
report and turn over any such treasure to the government which can 
then force the finder to assist it in the salvage effort any 
compensation is left to the governments discretion he said 
so knowing of those regulations i would really hate to find a 
treasure ship he said and if i did i would look the other 
way 
besides the 79yearold cousteau added im trying very hard 
to leave not 1 cent when i die

explorer jacquesyves cousteau launched a 
campaign wednesday to persuade the united states to scuttle a treaty 
that could open antarctica the last unspoiled area of our 
planet to mineral exploration 
the results of an industrial accident there would be 
incalculable said the 79yearold captain of the research vessel 
calypso 
had the exxon valdez spilled its oil off antarctica instead of 
alaska he said it would take hundreds of years to repair the 
damage 
cousteau at a speech and news conference at the national press 
club assailed a treaty adopted last year by the 39 signatory 
nations of the original antarctic treaty of 1961 which included the 
united states and soviet union 
why should we needlessly pillage the last unspoiled area of our 
planet he asked 
the socalled wellington convention adopted in wellington new 
zealand would open antarctica to mineral exploration and 
development though stringent if not insurmountable environmental 
guidelines would apply 
the treaty lacks an enforcement mechanism for the environmental 
rules and cousteau argues that once careful mining is allowed 
careless mining can happen 
the treaty is virtually dead already despite backing by the 
reagan and bush administrations because france and australia two 
of the seven nations with veto authority have suspended 
ratification 
i am here because the united states is extremely important as 
the nation which has done the most scientific research in 
antarctica cousteau said accordingly it has increased 
responsibility to discourage mineral exploration 
no one has demonstrated the commercial feasibility of mining 
antarctica for oil or any other mineral resource the best 
possibility said cousteau is drilling for oil offshore the 
worst thing imaginable to do that would present a far greater 
danger than it does in the north sea 
the dangers he said would apply both to the environment and 
those who would attempt exploration 
were talking about the harshest weather conditions in the 
world and that sooner or later would cause an inevitable 
disaster cousteau said citing heavy fog and daggerlike winds 
that often reach 200 mph among the hazards 
after the exxon valdez spill in prince william sound last year 
he said 4000 people were sent to clean it up can you imagine 
4000 people being sent to antarctica certainly not 
he said that the benign bacteria that act as natures own 
scrubbers of oil spills even in the cold waters off alaska are 
virtually nonexistent in the harsher antarctic climate 
antarctica comprises 90 percent of the ice and 70 percent of the 
fresh water in the world yet its climate is classified as desert 
because it receives less rain than the sahara 
the frigid waters team with krill and plankton icefish and 
sponges whales seals skuas albatrosses and penguins also thrive 
within the continents boundaries 
the continent already has endured pillaging long ago crews 
slaughtered more than half the seals and 90 percent of the whales 
earlier this year an argentine supply ship ripped open its hull 
on a rock and spilled several tons of oil thousands of birds were 
killed and a small area of the sea was sterilized jeopardizing 
scientific research at the us palmer station 
the antarctic treaty of 1961 affirms that it is in the interest 
of all mankind that antarctica shall continue forever to be used 
exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or 
object of international discord 
it did not specifically bar commercial exploitation of its 
resources

miami school superintendent joseph a fernandez 
was named wednesday to head new yorks public school system the 
nations largest and one beset by educational and criminal problems 
fernandez a 53yearold native new yorker will start as school 
chancellor in january or february and be paid 195000 a year board 
of education chief robert wagner jr said 
he will stand as a splendid role model wagner said 
his selection to replace richard green who died in may of an 
asthma attack means that a minority group member will continue to 
lead a school system in which 80 percent of the 940000 children 
belong to minority groups green hired away from minneapolis was 
the first black chancellor his two immediate predecessors were 
hispanic 
fernandez was born in east harlem of puerto rican heritage and 
attended public schools in new york he dropped out of high school 
but received an equivalency diploma while in the air force and went 
on to attend columbia university 
a high dropout rate among hispanic students is one of many 
problems fernandez will face as chancellor along with overcrowded 
and dilapidated buildings corruption a difficult bureaucracy and 
the infiltration of guns gangs and drugs even at elementary schools 
fernandezs entire educational career has been in florida where 
he started as a math teacher within 10 years of joining the miami 
school system in 1962 he became the citys first hispanic principal 
as superintendent of the miamidade county system fernandez 
began a decentralization experiment that has reached 100 out of the 
citys 260 schools in those schools principals teachers and 
parents confer to make decisions that previously were made at a 
central office 
new york citys schools were decentralized by legislation in 
1970 resulting in a system often criticized as flawed by patronage 
the united federation of teachers which represents 102000 new 
york city school employees welcomed the appointment and praised 
fernandez for emphasizing schoolbased management and shared 
decision making 
democratic mayoral nominee david dinkins and republican rudolph 
giuliani had no immediate comment on fernandezs selection dinkins 
had suggested the board pick a chancellor before the november 
election while giuliani had favored waiting until the new mayor is 
chosen 
fernandez was one of three candidates considered by the new york 
board robert r bud spillane superintendent of schools in 
fairfax county va was interviewed tuesday and the third matthew 
w prophet superintendent in portland ore withdrew from 
consideration 
in 1987 during the search that was to lead to greens 
appointment the board had asked fernandez to apply but he said the 
timing was wrong since he had just been named to lead the miami 
system the nations fourthbiggest 
when approached anew this year by the citys search committee 
fernandez initially expressed interest then he said he did not want 
the job but last week changed his mind 
he was torn between his sense of commitment to miamidade and 
his sense of the challenge of taking on the problems of the city 
wagner said 
new york offered him a 40000 raise over his miami salary of 
155000 a year or 45000 more than green was paid 
fernandez and his wife lily have four grown children

parliament agreed wednesday to send former 
socialist premier andreas papandreou before a special high court on 
charges of masterminding a wiretapping network while in office 
the court will be made up of the supreme court president and 12 
supreme court or appeals court judges it will investigate the 
charges against papandreou and try him if it finds enough evidence 
the 300seat parliament voted for the proposal 1692 after a 
twoday debate the 124 members of papandreous panhellenic 
socialist movement boycotted the vote 
the lawmakers acted on the recommendation of a 12member 
parliamentary committee which concluded that papandreou was behind 
the wiretaps of both political friends and foes from may 1987 to 
last april 
papandreou was defeated in elections in june after eight years in 
power 
the conservative new democracy party and the communistled 
coalition of the left and progress are in a governing alliance that 
has declared its aim of putting on trial papandreou and several 
former ministers and officials of his party it accuses them of 
involvement in scandals 
the 70yearold former premier boycotted parliamentary sessions 
to investigate the scandals however he sent a memorandum on 
tuesday charging that his opponents were penalizing political 
life slandering political figures and undermining institutions and 
normality 
the parliamentary commission of inquiry reported last week that 
papandreou had willfully instigated through national intelligence 
chief costas tsimas and intelligence service employees the 
decision to commit illegal acts and carry out the tapping of 
telephones 
the report named former greek telecommunications organization 
managing director theofanis tombras and tsimas as papandreous 
accomplices and called for their prosecution as well 
in an open vote parliament approved sending tombras and tsimas 
to the special court along with papandreou 
tsimas is now a member of the european parliament 
constantine mitsotakis head of the new democracy party 
presented parliament with official intelligence documents which he 
said proved that reports from wiretaps were sent to papandreou 
another parliamentary commission reported last week that enough 
evidence existed against papandreou and four people who served as 
his ministers to send them before a special court in connection with 
the purported embezzlement of 210 million from the bank of crete 
parliament will debate that proposal next week

western aleutian islands on wednesday but there were no reports of 
damage the alaska tsunami warning center said 
the quake measuring 59 on the richter scale was centered in the 
rat islands of the aleutian chain and occurred at 519 am adt 
officials at the palmer center said 
the quake was felt in amchitka an aleutians community about 30 
miles from the epicenter 
the 1964 good friday earthquake in alaska measured 85 on the 
richter scale and was centered in prince william sound it generated 
large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed 
131 people as far south as oregon and hawaii 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of magnitude 35 can cause slight damage 4 
moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage a magnitude 
7 quake is a major earthquake capable of widespread damage 8 is a 
great quake capable of tremendous damage

the communist party on wednesday demanded that the 
nations troubled republics quiet their growing calls for 
independence but promised to grant them more control of their 
economies 
president mikhail s gorbachev speaking at the close of a 
meeting by the partys policymaking central committee said it was 
time to strike a determined blow at those who offer us inss and serious 
affairs adventurist platforms 
the session was called to adopt a program addressing burgeoning 
ethnic tensions and unrest among the soviet unions numerous 
nationalities 
later wednesday tass news agency reporttead of 
politiced a stunning shakeup of 
the ruling communist party politburo by gorbachev gorbachev who is 
party general secretary as well as the countrys president retired 
three full members in a dramatic consolidation of power 
those stepping down were former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov 
66 viktor p nikonov 60 and ukrainian party chief vladimir v 
shcherbitsky 71 
that will leave vitaly i vorotnikov of the russian republic as 
the only one left on the 11member as not appointed 
by gorbachev 
at wednesdays central committee session gorbachev spoke 
extemporaneously and jabbed his finger in the air for emphasis as he 
asked party members to fall in behind the program aimed at curbing 
unrest he said the country could not afford to be dragged into 
any reshaping of borders changing shapes of national 
formations 
the party platform under development for the past 18 months is 
a blueprint for calming the tensions that have caused more than 200 
deaths and brought calls in some republics particularly in the 
baltics and the caucasus republic of georgia for outright 
independence 
it declared that republics have the right to own and manage their 
resources without kremlin central planning it said that the 
republics should enjoy broad opportunities to invigorate their 
economy and culture while relying on the overall strength of the 
national economy 
in adopting the program the central committee called the program 
the political basis for the renewal of the soviet federation 
in the twoday debate party officials split on thorny ethnic 
problems with hardliners calling for a crackdown on disorder in the 
republics and reformers shooting back that they cannot be blamed for 
processes unleashed by the reformminded gorbachevs tolerant views 
the differences in the central committee evident in speeches 
distributed by tass wednesday reflected soviet societys 
polarization over calls for sovereignty 
part of the population has fallen under the influence of 
extremist political slogans another part is of a conservative mood 
not feeling real changes in the social conditions of life 
politburo member vitaly i vorotnikov told the meeting 
in a critique that apparently included gorbachev vorotnikov said 
party officials from the local level up through the ruling politburo 
were guilty of mistakes in analyzing the political situation 
local communist leaders in remarks reported wednesday supported 
plans togive local officials more control over their economies 
officials said that many factories and offices that are under direct 
control of government ministries in moscow pay little or no local 
taxes and therefore do little to improve the living standards in the 
provinces that contributes to local discontent they said 
but absamat masaliev communist party chief of the central asian 
republic of kirghizia said the line must be drawn at calling for 
outright independence from the soviet union 
the time has come to bring to order those who openly speak 
out against our structure our unity sabotage perestroika and abuse 
democracy he said 
masaliev said calls to turn the soviet communist party into a 
union of independent parties or to introduce a multiparty system 
represent an extremely dangerous and destructive tendency 
yuri yelchenko a secretary of the ukrainian communist party 
said legislation must be passed to disperse what he called 
nationalistic or chauvinistic organizations and groups 
a score of people were killed by soldiers during a nationalist 
protest in the georgian republic in april and some georgian 
activists have charged that the violence was ordered specifically by 
officials in moscow 
the georgian communist party chief givi gumbaridze charged that 
excesses on nationalist grounds often are programmed ahead and 
intended to require curfews imposition of special forms of 
administration and that means a rejection of democratic 
principles 
algirdas brazauskas party chief of the baltic republic 
lithuania said his republic had no intention of trying to leave the 
soviet union but he said the stormy discussions taking place there 
about the future of the republic are only a reflection of the forces 
unleashed by gorbachevs reforms 
brazauskas said the party platform on ethnic relations did not go 
far enough to condemn the abuses of josef stalin who absorbed 
lithuania and its neighbors latvia and estonia then killed or 
exiled thousands of their residents 
gorbachev said tuesday that stalins policies were wrong but that 
the baltic republics joined the soviet union voluntarily rather than 
face adolf hitlers nazi forces alone 
moscow is faced with one of its toughest ethnic problems in the 
caucasus republics of armenia and azerbaijan which have been locked 
for the past 18 months in a bloody dispute over control of the 
nagornokarabakh region a predominantly armenian enclave within the 
territory of azerbaijan 
about 100 people have been killed in ethnic violence there 
including two policemen who were knifed on tuesday as gorbachev was 
telling the nation the kremlin would not tolerate anarchy there 
armenian communist party chief suren arutyunyan asked officials 
why they had done nothing over nearly two months to stop what he 
said is an economic blockade of his republic by azerbaijan

federal investigators are blaming a 1988 delta 
crash on the flight crew and the airline which has already accepted 
reponsibility for the disaster which killed 14 people 
delta air lines has admitted that the flight crew failed to 
properly set wing flaps before takeoff aug 31 1988 from 
dallasfort worth international airport the boeing 727 crashed and 
exploded on takeoff killing 14 people 95 survived 
investigators for the national transporation safety board reached 
the same conclusion according to a draft report obtained by the 
dallas times herald the crew also failed to follow proper emergency 
procedures the newspaper reported in wednesdays edition 
ntsb spokesman michael benson said the report is not necessarily 
the governments final word on the crash 
the report is unofficial benson said wednesday the only 
time it becomes official is when the fivemember ntsb board votes to 
take action on the report they may make revisions or adopt the 
report as is 
the board meets next tuesday to consider the 174page report 
the newspaper said the report concludes that the crews failure 
to follow preflight checklist procedures and its complacent cockpit 
behavior led to its neglecting to set the flaps 
cockpit tapes revealed that the crew talked about a previous 
fatal plane crash politics and other nonflight related issues 
before takeoff in violation of federal rules 
the management policies of delta regarding crew guidance and 
training were deficient and directly causal to this accident 
the report says 
it also finds fault with the federal aviation administration 
which it contends contributed to the accident by failing to correct 
known deficiencies in deltas operations 
jackie pate an atlantabased delta representative said wednesday 
that delta officials had not seen the report and would not comment 
until the boards findings were made official 
delta has fired the three crew members of flight 1141 and the 
crew is appealing the firing 
the ntsb draft report also says that the accident might have been 
averted had the captain advanced to full power and lowered the nose 
of the airplane shortly after encountering trouble 
a few months after the crash delta tightened its preflight 
checklist procedures and began retraining 
the report recommends that the faa ensure that the roles of 
flight crew members are clearly delineated in all carriers 
operations manuals it also recommends that the agency require that 
verifying the flap position and proper procedures to save a 
faltering airplane be included in manuals

peru imposed a nighttime curfew in the 
provinces of ayacucho and huancavelica in response to the 
assassination of the mayor of this historic andean city authorities 
said wednesday 
mayor fermin azparrent was killed tuesday in his home by three 
young men firing submachine guns police said they said the killers 
escaped and identified them as members of the maoist shining path 
rebel group 
police said shining path rebels also killed a village mayor in 
the amazon jungle and that two rebels died in a shootout with a 
police patrol in the central andes 
fifty mayors now have been killed in political violence in peru 
in the past five years 
relatives said the 64yearold azparrent received numerous death 
threats from leftist guerrillas and from paramilitary death squads 
and survived at least eight earlier attempts on his life 
he recently resumed his duties in ayacucho a mountain city of 
120000 people 235 miles southeast of lima after spending months in 
the capital because of the death threats 
government officials say the shining path is out to sabotage 
nationwide municipal elections scheduled for nov 12 
the curfew affects about 1 million people in the two andean 
provinces already under state of emergency restrictions due to the 
violence the indefinite curfew restricts free movement and 
gatherings 
it is the sixth curfew in the city of ayacucho since the shining 
path launched its armed insurgency in 1980

an area of arlington national cemetery would be 
set aside for the unmarked burial of the ashes of veterans as a way 
to prevent overcrowding according to legislation approved wednesday 
by a house panel 
the ashes which would not be placed in urns would be buried 
under sod or in small holed 
the legislation sponsored by rep charles e bennett dfla 
envisions a welltended green area for the remains with a wall 
bearing the names of those whose ashes are buried there according 
to a bennett aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the house veterans affairs committee approved the measure such 
burial would be optional and would not use any space designated for 
caskets 
we dont know what kind of response this is going to get the 
aide said adding that the army would insist on a fitting ceremony 
and interment to address concerns that it may seem like a mass 
grave 
arlington on a hillside directly across the potomac from 
washington is expected to run out of casket space in 2020 the 
columbarium where urns are stored is expected to be full in 2029 
veterans may request burial at arlington or other national 
cemeteries 
more than 9 million world war ii veterans are still alive the 
number of veterans over 65 total nearly 6 million and should be 
nearly 9 million by the turn of the century 
restrictions were placed on burials in 1967 in the first effort 
to prevent the cemetery from filling too rapidly about 190000 
people are buried in the 612acre cemetery 
in another action the committee approved legislation to create a 
world war ii memorial in or near the district of columbia paid for 
by donations and taxes 
no cost estimate is possible because no decisions have been made 
on size location or design

an editor at playboy magazine said wednesday 
that extensive investigation turned up no reasons to disbelieve an 
informant who says former teamsters leader jimmy hoffa was buried 
beneath giants stadium 
i lived with this story for seven months said peter moore 
an associate articles editor for playboy youre kind of walking 
on eggs on a story like this 
the story in the chicagobased magazines november issue quotes 
donald tony the greek frankos a selfdescribed hitman and 
federally protected witness in the upcoming new york trial of 
alleged organizedcrime boss john gotti 
frankos claims he told the fbi in 1986 that hoffa was shot to 
death by alleged irish mob boss jimmy coonan and dismembered in a 
house near the detroit suburb of mount clemens coonan is serving a 
lengthy prison term in an unrelated case 
frankos says hoffas body was stored in a freezer until it was 
buried in concrete next to the west end zone of the football stadium 
near new york 
fbi officials have declined to comment on frankos account one 
of many purporting to explain hoffas july 1975 disappearance 
in chicago fbi spokesman bob long said wednesday that aside 
from saying there is still an active investigation there wouldnt 
be any statement we would not be commenting on the validity or lack 
of validity on that story 
new jersey state police superintendent col clinton l pagano 
said he places little credibility in the report that view is shared 
by robert mulcahy president and chief executive officer of the new 
jersey sports amp exposition authority which runs giants stadium 
frankos says hoffa was killed in a dispute over his desire to 
regain control of the teamsters union after his release from federal 
prison in lewisburg pa where he was serving time for mail fraud 
and jury tampering 
confirmation for me would be finding the body moore said 
in a telephone interview we confirmed it to the degree that it is 
possible when youre dealing with major underworld figures 
moore said he received a telephone call seven months ago from 
someone with a husky voice offering information on where hoffas 
remains could be found 
moore said he was doubtful but began research moore said he and 
at least three staff members conducted scores of interviews checked 
on the relationships frankos claimed to have and were able to 
uncover no inconsistencies in frankos story 
we got to the point where we believed that enough of don 
frankos story was checking out that we had to run with it moore 
said 
it was a real game to get information that can corroborate a 
story like this he said there are people trying to put him in 
jail for the same thing were trying to report on we were doing a 
dance for a while 
the only person to meet frankos was lake headley a private 
investigator moore only spoke with frankos by telephone 
headley of wysocki amp associates in las vegas conducted the 
interview which will appear in playboys november issue he was en 
route wednesday to new york and could not be reached for comment 
according to his partner mike wysocki

prosecutors wrapped up their case 
wednesday at ptl founder jim bakkers fraud trial saying his 
ministry had sold 1579 million worth of lodging rights to 152903 
believers by the time he quit 
the government showed the jury a final piece of videotape showing 
bakker urging his followers to send money for socalled lifetime 
partnerships in his ministry 
prosecutors contend that bakker used the money raised through 
partnership sales to finance a lavish lifestyle instead of building 
lodging he had promised the partners who were supposed to get a few 
days of free lodging every year 
the government case in bakkers fraud and conspiracy trial 
started aug 28 
before presenting their evidence bakkers attorneys asked that 
the charges be dismissed saying bakkers rights were being 
violated not those of his followers 
what we have is a ministry a religious entity said attorney 
harold bender said everything it did was religious in nature the 
constitution prohibits government interference in a religion 
prosecutor jerry miller disagreed saying this is not a case 
about religion it is a case about lying to the people on television 
and cheating them out of their money 
the motion was denied by us district judge robert potter and 
the defense began by showing the jury more tapes of the ptl 
television show 
earlier fbi agent john pearson recapped testimony showing that 
as of may 31 1987 two months after bakker resigned ptl had 
152903 fully paid partnerships costing 1579 million 
pearson said contributors sent 669 million for heritage grand 
partnerships and about 528 percent of that was spent on 
construction of the hotel 
more than 74 million was spent for towers hotel partnerships 
pearson said and 154 percent of that was spent on the partially 
built hotel about 17 million was sent by believers for 
partnerships in bunkhouses and 56 percent was spent on construction 
of one 16room bunkhouse 
testimony showed that bakker sold lodging rights in a 16room 
bunkhouse to more than 42000 people and agreed to cut the number of 
bunkhouses in half while urging more people to send money 
during a broadcast of his ptl club show bakker told viewers 
he wasnt trying to profit from lifetime partnership sales at ptls 
heritage park usa complex in fort mill sc 
were not here to make money bakker said in an august 1986 
broadcast i hope my critics wake up and realize id be a fool if 
i tried to make money off something like this 
this is a deal of a lifetime bakker told viewers in another 
august promotional broadcast there are no fees this is not a 
profitmaking organization 
bakkers comments came while he offered a new lodging program 
called the family heritage club donors of 500 would get three days 
and two nights in 16unit bunkhouses he said only one 
bunkhouse was completed when bakker resigned in disgrace in march 
1987 
bakker is accused in 24 fraud and conspiracy counts of diverting 
more than 37 million in ptl money raised from the partnership 
sales to pay for personal luxuries if found guilty of the 24 counts 
against him he could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined 
more than 5 million 
at one point bakker said all the partnerships available had been 
sold then in march 1987 secondincommand richard dortch said in a 
telethon that more partnerships in the neverfinished towers hotel 
were available because 70 percent of the people on the monthly 
installment plan had not lived up to their obligations 
the first defense videotape showed a july 4 1984 dedication 
ceremony at heritage usa for three facilities a water park a home 
for handicapped children called kevins house and fort hope for 
the homeless

mikhail gorbachev pulled off a major shakeup of 
the communist party politburo on wednesday retiring a quarter of 
the ruling elite in one stroke and promoting his kgb chief and his 
top economic planner 
dropped from power was the 71yearold ukrainian party chief 
vladimir v shcherbitsky former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov 66 
and viktor p nikonov 60 leaving only one pregorbachev appointee 
on the 11member politburo 
kgb gen vladimir a kryuchkov who presided over a partial 
opening up of his secrecybound agency and economic planning chief 
yuri d maslyukov were promoted 
at a time when economic failures and ethnic violence prompted 
some soviets to fret openly about the possibility of a coup or civil 
war the move demonstrated gorbachevs firm control at the pinnacle 
of soviet power 
it also gave him a stronger hand in moscow as the leadership 
writes a new program and rules to govern the party in the 1990s 
the central committee on tuesday moved up the date for the next 
congress to october 1990 handing gorbachev an early opportunity to 
reach deep into party ranks to completely remold its top echelon 
gorbachev is both the nations president and the general secretary 
of the soviet communist party 
the shakeup came at a meeting of the party central committee 
after the 251member policymaking body approved a program demanding 
that restive soviet republics stifle calls to leave the union but 
acceding to demands for more local control of the economy 
the oftdelayed session was called to address burgeoning ethnic 
tensions and unrest among the soviet unions numerous nationalities 
it sought to calm the strife while drawing a line at calls for 
independence or secession 
for activists in some republics the removal of shcherbitsky and 
chebrikov probably will ease the sting of gorbachevs toughly worded 
rejection of drives for sovereignty 
tass the official news agency said gorbachev thanked the three 
politburo members warmly for their many years of fruitful 
activity in the party indicating they were retiring in good grace 
shcherbitsky regarded as a conservative force both in moscow and 
his native ukraine was the last politburo member other than 
gorbachev still serving from the time of president leonid i 
brezhnev his retirement makes vitaly i vorotnikov of the russian 
republic the only pregorbachev appointee remaining on the politburo 
brezhnev was in power from 196482 
rumors of shcherbitskys impending retirement circulated for 
years because of his conservative views he presumably will remain 
party chief in the ukraine until a replacement can be named 
chebrikov had moved from head of the kgb last september to a new 
party position overseeing legal affairs said to be one of those 
responsible for gorbachevs selection as party chief in 1985 he 
nevertheless has been regarded recently by some western analysts as 
a foe and potential rival to gorbachev 
his departure was likely to please activists in georgia 
especially where chebrikov was suspected of having prior knowledge 
of a military assault that killed a score of nationalist 
demonstrators in april 
nikonov had described himself earlier this year as a deputy to 
yegor k ligachev on party agricultural policy he appeared to serve 
no clear function on the politburo and his views on major policy 
questions were not well known 
in dallas on friday opposition soviet politician boris yeltsin 
singled out chebrekov and shcherbitsky as two politburo members he 
said must go yeltsin chairman of a newly formed independent caucus 
in the soviet congress said ligachev and vitaly vorotnikov were two 
others who must leave the politburo 
he said their departure was needed to reduce the pressure on 
gorbachev from the right which is preventing him from acting more 
decisively 
yeltsin also had called for a party congress soon during his us 
visit 
newly designated politburo member kryuchkov is a career 
intelligence officer who has engaged the kgb in a charm offensive 
he has undergone an unprecedented legislative confirmation 
hearing begun granting interviews and authorizing news conferences 
and said the kgb seeks to cooperate with its western counterparts to 
control terrorism and drug trafficking 
maslyukov the head of the state planning committee also was 
promoted to full politburo membership his difficult tasks include 
sorting out economic relations with republics that are clamoring for 
more economic independence from moscow 
three regional party chiefs with agricultural expertise yegor s 
stroyev of orel yuri a mananyenkov of lipetsk and gumer i usmanov 
of the tatar region of russia were promoted to the central 
commmittees secretariat in moscow so too was andrei n girenko 
a longtime communist official who ran the party organization in the 
crimean peninsula 
two candidate or nonvoting members of the politburo yuri 
solovyev and nikolai talyzin also were forced out their places 
were taken by yevgeny primakov head of the soviet of the union 
legislative chamber and boris pugo head of the party commission 
overseeing discipline 
solovyev was embarrassed in march when he was rejected in an 
election for the new congress of peoples deputies parliament even 
though he ran unopposed he subsequently was removed as leningrad 
party chief 
talyzin was maslyukovs predecessor as planning chief but was 
demoted twice before finally being dropped from the politburo 
gorbachev on tuesday told the central committee the kremlin could 
tolerate neither anarchy nor separatist demagogues he said in 
closing remarks wednesday it was time to strike a determined blow 
at those who offer us instead of politics and serious affairs 
adventurist platforms 
he called for support of the program saying the country could 
not afford to be dragged into any reshaping of borders 
changing shapes of national formations

members of a conservativebacked group denied 
entry to nicaragua to monitor elections there questioned wednesday 
whether a delegation led by former president carter will be able to 
effectively judge the fairness of the voting 
we would hope that their people will get out into the 
countryside and do what we would have done said curtin winsor 
cochairman of the bipartisan commission on free and fair elections 
in nicaragua and former reagan administration ambassador to costa 
rica 
if they dont i am afraid that at best their work will be 
incomplete and at worst it will be badly flawed 
another commission member alan keyes assistant secretary of 
state for international organization affairs in the reagan 
administration said he didnt think the carter group is going to 
help us one bit to make our judgment about the process over time 
they are only going to help perhaps to make a judgment about 
election day 
commission member elaine kamarck a writer and teacher who has 
been an adviser to democratic presidential candidates said carter 
did a wonderful job as an election observer in panama where he 
denounced the may elections as fraudulent 
he certainly has some credibility she said adding that the 
former president will need input from observers who are less 
wellknown than he 
i have every faith that jimmy carter will process all 
information and data appropriately ms kamarck said i think 
the problem will be making sure that he gets the right information 
the nicaraguan elections are scheduled for feb 25 carter who 
ended a threeday visit to the country tuesday will meet with 
president bush at the white house on thursday to discuss the 
elections 
also wednesday congressional sources said the bush 
administration would ask for 9 million for direct and indirect aid 
for chamorros campaign 
the money to be funneled both directly to the opposition 
political coalition and indirectly through the quasigovernmental 
national endowment for democracy and united nations election 
observers would meet an estimated 80 percent or more of chamorro 
election budget according to administration estimates 
although there are problems the agreements reached give us 
optimism that the elections will be free and fair carter said 
before leaving managua noting that the opposition had accused the 
leftist sandinista government of failing to live up to agreements 
he said his team would organize an independent vote count the 
night of the elections but wont release its tallies until after 
the official returns are announced 
the nicaraguan government the supreme electoral council and the 
political opposition invited carter to observe the elections as 
chairman of the council of freely elected heads of state an 
atlantabased organization 
the united nations and the organization of american states also 
will send observer teams 
the privately financed bipartisan commission was created by the 
conservative world freedom foundation to establish criteria for the 
election and observe its fairness 
the nicaraguan embassy announced sept 13 that it had denied the 
group visas saying that the president of the foundation had 
recently visited contra camps in honduras and expressed his support 
of the rebels 
winsor keyes and ms kamarck appeared at a luncheon at the 
conservative heritage foundation 
the commissions other members are former sen gaylord nelson 
dwis who with winsor is cochairman of the group sergio bendixen 
a democratic political consultant who has worked in latin american 
campaigns and vic gold an aide to thenvice president george bush

house democratic leaders said wednesday they 
would fight president bushs capital gains tax cut with an 
alternative that would raise levies on the wealthy to partially 
restore tax breaks for middleclass individual retirement accounts 
republican leaders predicted the capitol hill budget battle would 
push past congress deadlines for enacting deficitreduction 
legislation forcing nearly 17 billion in governmentwide spending 
reductions 
the house democratic plan was modeled loosely on a proposal by 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas to provide a 50 percent tax deduction 
for money put into individual retirement accounts said rep dan 
rostenkowski dill 
in addition ira contributions could be withdrawn without penalty 
if the money were used for education or a firsttime home purchase 
to pay for the ira program and raise more money toward reducing 
the deficit the democratic plan would raise to 33 percent the 
marginal tax rate for the nations wealthiest taxpayers most now 
pay a top rate of 28 percent on most of their income even though 
some in the upper middle class pay 33 percent on part of their 
income 
according to a study earlier this year by the congressional 
budget office extending the 33 percent rate into the upper incomes 
would raise 429 billion over the next five years 
the exact cost of the ira tax break had not been determined 
because details of the proposal were still being worked out 
however rep leon panetta dcalif said it would be less than the 
money gained from the upperclass tax increase and leave a 
significant amount for deficit reduction 
the democratic leadership plan will be offered as an alternative 
to the capital gains tax cut supported by bush house republicans 
and a group of mostly conservative democrats 
republican leaders after a meeting wednesday with bush at the 
white house said it was almost certain congress would fail to agree 
on a deficitreduction measure by midoctober the deadline in the 
grammrudman budgetbalancing law 
sen pete domenici rnm the senior republican on the budget 
committee said the cuts would total about 168 billion half from 
defense and half from domestic programs 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law requires congress and the 
president to reduce the deficit to within 10 billion of the 100 
billion 1990 deficit target by oct 15 or cuts are mandated to bring 
the deficit down 
however the lions share of the deficit reduction needed this 
year is contained in the big budget bill carrying the capital gains 
provision and a host of other contentious issues including child 
care and revisions to the catastrophic health insurance program 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said there was a 
somewhat bleak prospect for averting the spending cuts 
house republican whip newt gingrich rga speaking after the 
morning meeting said bush was firm in his opposition to a tax rate 
increase to help raise revenues to offset the deficit 
to propose such an increase is to guarantee a veto as is 
inclusion of addon spending projects that bush opposes 
if in fact it has a child care bill that is unacceptable and 
if it has pension proposals that are unacceptable hell veto it 
meanwhile senators of both parties met for more than an hour and 
republicans agreed to consider a democratic proposal to add 1 
billion to the war on drugs with money saved through a 425 percent 
acrosstheboard cut in all federal spending programs 
the two sides were negotiating not only in an effort to pay for 
the drug war but to get appropriations moving again on the senate 
floor republicans have stalled action on the money bills with 10 
days before the start of the new fiscal year as means of gaining 
leverage in the dispute over the narcotics program 
democrats initially sought a 05 percent acrosstheboard cut as 
a means of finding 22 billion to add to the drug war mainly in 
the realm of prevention education and treatment the bush 
administration balked at that on grounds that it would hit too hard 
at the pentagon 
the democratic plan really was a counterproposal to a republican 
offer made earlier of a 025 percent acrosstheboard cut combined 
with targeted spending reductions in specific programs 
sen mark o hatfield rore the chief republican negotiator 
said afterward that the meeting was all very positive 
it certainly narrows the gap in many ways hatfield said

richard ramirez was convicted of 13 murders 
and 30 felonies wednesday by a jury that decided he was the 
devilworshiping night stalker whose nocturnal attacks terrified 
california in 1985 
in addition the jurors found 18 special circumstances existed 
making ramirez eligible for the death penalty 
the defendant convicted on all counts against him demanded to 
be absent from court when the 63 separate verdict forms were read by 
superior court judge michael tynan 
the judge granted his request saying a recent appeals court 
decision gave him no choice ramirez who left the courtroom with 
shackles rattling around his ankles heard the verdicts from 
loudspeaker in a nearby holding cell 
his attorney said later that ramirez had no reaction while 
listening to the verdict as he was taken from the courthouse 
ramirez flashed a twofinger devil sign to photographers 
asked what he thought about the verdicts the 29yearold el paso 
native said only evil 
the jurors found that ramirez was the demonic killer who 
committed crimes of rape sodomy oral copulation burglary and 
attempted murder in addition to murder 
they found that 12 of the murders were firstdegree but decided 
the killing of tsailian yu was murder in the seconddegree she was 
dragged from her car and killed as she screamed for help on march 
17 1985 
in the packed courtroom relatives of three of the victims sat 
with their heads bowed as the verdicts were read tynan said the 
penalty phase of the trial would begin sept 27 
the trial lasted more than a year and it took more than a month 
for the jury to reach its verdicts after bizarre interruptions 
including the murder of a juror required them to restart their 
deliberations twice 
my personal feeling is the jury could no longer be objective 
after the death of the juror defense attorney daniel hernandez 
said after the verdicts were delivered and the media was so 
overwhelmingly decided of his guilt that no one could give him a 
fair trial 
the jurors spent 22 days in their second set of talks after the 
slaying 
the jurors murder was a likely basis for the defense appeal of 
ramirez conviction it came on the heels of the dismissal of 
another juror for sleeping during deliberations 
the jury was then 13 days into its talks a day after 
deliberations restarted with an alternate replacing the sleepy 
juror the panel was jolted again 
juror phyllis singletary failed to appear one morning and was 
found beaten and shot to death at the home she shared with her 
boyfriend the next day the man committed suicide and left a note 
saying he killed her in an argument 
jurors wept when they learned of the tragedy and tynan was faced 
with his most trying legal challenge lawyers said there were no 
legal precedents for the situation 
defense attorneys argued that the jurors were too distraught to 
resume their talks and noted that ms singletarys murder was 
similar to the gruesome attacks attributed to the night stalker 
tynan decided to move forward we must get on with the task 
life has given us he told jurors ordering them to begin 
deliberations with an alternate replacing the dead juror the 
defense motion for a mistrial was denied 
the verdicts came four years after southern californias searing 
summer of terror in 1985 residents slept behind locked doors and 
windows fearing a demonic killer who struck in the night often 
leaving a husband dead and a wife raped and beaten 
the news media dubbed the assailant the night stalker 
some of the crimes were grisly beyond imagining a womans eyes 
were gouged out after she was slain a man was murdered in his bed 
and his wife was raped beside the dead body the killer beat a small 
child and attempted to sodomize him 
there were signs of devil worship a pentagram drawn on the wall 
at one murder scene and survivors accounts of being ordered to 
swear to satan 
the first killing was in 1984 but 12 of the murders attributed 
to the same killer happened between march and august of 1985 there 
were other murders in orange county and san francisco by july the 
killer was striking only a few days apart on some days he struck 
twice 
on july 21 police released a drawing of the night stalker 
suspect a man with dark curly hair and bad teeth 
but it was not until aug 30 that authorities linked a 
fingerprint found at one murder scene to richard ramirez his photo 
was published in newspapers and shown on tv 
soon police were inundated with reports that the suspect had 
been sighted in east los angeles and they launched an air and ground 
search 
on aug 31 citizens captured ramirez after he pulled a woman 
from her car and tried to grab her keys she screamed its the 
killer the killer 
neighbors grabbed metal pipes and sticks and began chasing the 
man 
we ran after him halfway down the street said a man who 
joined the chase we just all gang tackled him and we just held 
him down 
law enforcement officers who arrested ramirez formed a human 
chain of 50 officers to protect him from a crowd shouting kill 
him kill him 
with ramirez capture the case moved into the courts with 
lawyers vying to represent the famous defendant ramirez chose a 
pair of relatively inexperienced attorneys from san jose 
daniel and arturo hernandez not related frustrated judges and 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney p philip halpin with 
repeated maneuvers for delay more experienced counsel were 
appointed to assist them 
ramirez court appearances drew crowds the lanky shaggyhaired 
defendant rarely stood still rattling shackles around his ankles as 
he danced in place to imagined music only he could hear 
at one court session ramirez shouted hail satan and 
displayed a pentagram drawn on the palm of his hand 
in 1986 a preliminary hearing disclosed for the first time the 
ghastly details of each victims ordeal and ramirez was ordered to 
stand trial various judges came and went from the case until it was 
finally assigned to superior court judge michael tynan who pushed 
for a speedy trial 
jury selection began in july 1988 and took six months 
testimony opened in january by then ramirez was a subdued figure 
slumped in his chair at the counsel table as witness after witness 
identified him as the night stalker 
i know its him because ill never forget his face even 
today said a woman who had been raped and beaten by the assailant 
who killed her husband 
ramirez laughed as a tiny foreignborn woman struggled to 
describe her rape 
a woman who had seen her husband slaughtered lashed out at 
ramirez from the witness stand 
you son of a bitch why did you kill him she shouted i 
gave you everything you wanted whats wrong with you he 
was such a nice man 
ramirez defense was mistaken identity attorney ray clark who 
assisted daniel hernandez after the lawyer said he was ill from 
stress said that witnesses were too traumatized to make accurate 
identifications 
defense witnesses included ramirez father who claimed his son 
was in el paso texas for a family gathering when two murders 
occurred 
clark argued that there was reasonable doubt of his guilt 
halpin urged conviction on all counts 
these were murders of men in their sleep rapes and sodomy of 
women after their husbands were dead said halpin these were 
consummate acts of cowardice

after flying into about 200 hurricanes 
bob sheets doesnt appear at all fazed by his responsibility as 
director of the national hurricane center to predict the path of the 
ferocious storms 
sheets 52 friendly and lowkey is in his third season as head 
of the worldwide command center for hurricane data in this suburb of 
miami 
you look out there and see the chaos but it really works 
he said wednesday while surveying the lowceiling wideopen room 
jammed with forecasters and reporters cameramen and photographers 
covering hurricane hugo 
hugo whose winds dropped to 105 mph after churning through the 
caribbean is the most powerful of nine named storms this year six 
of which became hurricanes storms like hugo make sheets a household 
name 
killer hurricanes like hugo which left at least 25 dead tens of 
thousands homeless and millions of dollars in damages in its rampage 
through the eastern caribbean make sheets a household name when 
they threaten the us mainland 
a typical half hour for sheets do live feeds for the networks 
and local television stations squeeze in a few minutes with a print 
reporter grab a phone to talk with a government official in myrtle 
beach sc consult with his team of forecasters on incoming data 
then it starts all over again 
hes a cool collected person the ideal person for this 
pressure job said gil clark a 34year veteran of the hurricane 
center hes got a real feeling for hurricanes and everything that 
goes with it 
sheets also gets high marks from his colleagues for scientific 
ability and poise 
he worked here as a forecaster before becoming deputy director 
and then director said hurricane specialist hal gerrish hes 
not just an administrator he can sit down and be able to pull one 
of the shifts with us 
one of the biggest pressures on sheets is to pinpoint where a 
hurricane will blast ashore a decision that can result in 
evacuations and huge expenditures it is one of his biggest 
frustrations 
its frustrating not to be able to say with a great deal of 
confidence this is where its going to move said sheets 
hugo has been an especially difficult storm to forecast beyond a 
couple of days but he said the devastation in the caribbean had 
been lessened because of forecasts and warnings issued by the center 
sheets in 16 years of research flights had his share of close 
calls flying into the eye of hurricanes he says he finds his 
current job very fulfilling despite offers to join reconnaissance 
crews checking hugo 
theres nothing there that i need to go and experience again 
he said grinning

for the first time in a month columbia 
had a day without bombings wednesday but the war on drugs reeled 
from allegations that the cocaine cartels have paid spies at work in 
the government army and police 
the senate on tuesday night heard six hours of testimony from 
defense minister gen oscar botero restrepo who denied opposition 
charges he is connected to foreign mercenaries training 
assassination squads for drug bosses 
botero said the government was aware since late 1988 of rumors 
that israeli and british military trainers were operating in the 
magdalena medio a central mountainous region known as a haven for 
paramilitary groups and cocaine labs 
but he said he could not confirm the reports until colombian 
media reported about them in april video tapes of civilians getting 
explosives training shooting from moving cars and attacking houses 
were sent to lawmakers 
the government never authorized or helped foreign mercenary 
groups that came to colombia said botero 
british ambassador richard neilson told colombian tv on tuesday 
night the government of colombia had information about british 
mercenaries in colombia in march and we were in a position to help 
them the government 
the special senate session came after arrest warrants were issued 
monday for two israelis former army col yair klein and civilian 
arik acek accused of training assassination squads for drug lords 
the drug cartels have used the paramilitary groups against 
leftist guerrillas considered enemies of the traditionally 
rightwing traffickers the guerrillas often wage their battles in 
the same regions drug lords have processing labs and hideouts 
death squads are also believed to have been used in an internal 
war between the medellin and cali cocaine cartels which compete to 
smuggle drugs to the united states 
interior minister orlando vasquez velasquez told senators he 
knows there is a massive infiltration of narcotraffickers in the 
government the armed forces police and congress 
officials say 85 members of the army and national police have 
been dismissed this year and charged with wrongdoing most for 
alleged links to cocaine merchants 
criminal investigations director omar henry velasco said tuesday 
the government is in the process of producing proof of corruption in 
high echelons of society here 
a group of senators urged the government to make public a rumored 
black list of politicians and journalists allegedly being paid 
by the drug cartels 
many in congress also allege the us embassy has a list of 
politicians denied visas to the united states because of purported 
ties with traffickers the embassy denies such a list exists but a 
us embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity said many 
colombians have been denied visas this year because of involvement 
in drug trafficking 
there was a lull tuesday in the daily barrage of terrorist 
bombings retaliating for the government crackdown but police 
reported two colombians fighting the cartels were killed tuesday by 
gunmen 
police said army lt cesar augusto garcia was shot in a 
restaurant tuesday in medellin hub of the cocaine cartel a police 
inspector in puerto parra also was reported shot in the back by two 
men 
the deaths bring the toll to at least seven people killed since 
president virgilio barco launched the drug war many more are 
believed to have been slain but it is difficult to differentiate 
between deaths connected to other criminal activity and those 
related to the drug war 
barcos action was triggered by the aug 18 assassination of 
popular presidential candidate luis carlos galan reportedly by 
gangs opposed to the senators staunch antidrug position

egypts president hosni mubarak appealed to 
israelis on wednesday to accept his ideas for starting peace talks 
with palestinians instead of banging your heads against the wall 
in an unusual interview with israels stateowned radio station 
mubarak asked israelis if they balked at accepting palestinians from 
outside the occupied territories as negotiators for fear they would 
bite 
mubarak interviewed in cairo addressed his remarks to the 
israeli public 
do you not understand that nobody in the occupied territories 
can do anything without a green light from palestinians abroad he 
asked 
mubaraks remarks translated by the interviewer from arabic into 
hebrew were broadcast a day after israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir rejected egypts 10point peace plan 
mubarak proposed basing negotiations on the landforpeace 
principle and letting the 140000 arabs in israeliannexed east 
jerusalem vote in the palestinian elections 
egypt is the only arab country to have a peace treaty with 
israel it is seeking to mediate between israel and the palestine 
liberation organization which the jewish state views as a terrorist 
organization 
shamir said he mainly objected to these mubarak points trading 
land for peace letting east jerusalem arabs vote and letting 
palestinians from outside the occupied west bank and gaza strip take 
part in peace talks 
israels peace initiative approved in may calls for palestinian 
elections leading to negotiations between israel and representatives 
of the west bank and gaza strip on limited autonomy for the occupied 
territories 
the israeli government has not taken an official stand on 
mubaraks plan the coalition cabinet is divided on it with 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposed and the leftofcenter labor 
party in favor 
leading likud opponents of the plan headed by trade minister 
ariel sharon gathered wednesday to declare their total rejection 
of the joint initiative by the plo and the president of egypt 
sharon told israel radio 
deputy premier david levy also a likud member said egypts 
initiative envelops the two dangers we have warned about the plo 
and a palestinian state 
in his remarks mubarak suggested including either palestinians 
deported by israel or those living in the united states as two 
representatives to a peace dialogue 
what will two of a delegation of 10 do these two from abroad 
will they bite and if israel says it will never speak to the plo 
ill bring two from outside the territories who have no sign saying 
they are plo mubarak said 
he scoffed at israeli fears that by letting outside palestinians 
join peace talks they would open the door to thousands of people to 
try to return to homes their families left during the 1948 
independence war 
a palestinian in egypt or elsewhere who has struck roots isnt 
going to return to you mubarak said 
he suggested israelis would never find palestinian dialogue 
partners not linked to the plo

hurricane hugo has left devastation in its wake 
here is an eyewitness account by an associated press reporter who 
visited st croix on wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as our chartered 
helicopter landed wednesday amid overturned seaplanes on a tiny 
runway in christiansted one resident rushed to the aircraft 
theyre tearing the island up said john delamater an 
employee of the seaplane company anything at all that they want 
to steal theyre taking 
during our sixhour visit to the island of st croix which was 
virtually devastated by hurricane hugo residents and tourists were 
anxious to talk about the storm damage and the lawlessness that 
followed 
the world did not know what they had suffered they said because 
all communications had been cut telephones were out lines down 
supplies of food and water dangerously low pure devastation they 
said of an island usually thought of as a caribbean paradise 
but even though many residents carried guns or knifes somehow we 
never felt in danger 
even the looters the poorer locals who picked over the remaining 
merchandise in the wrecked stores moved at a leisurely pace they 
tolerated a photographer and easily answered my questions about why 
they were stealing 
everybody was doing it they said and residents were worried 
that they were going to run out of food and supplies 
the friendliness of the residents was amazing considering what 
they had gone through although gasoline supplies were running out 
we found several residents happy to drive us around the island and 
point out the worst damage 
i had never visited the virgin islands before but had envisioned 
the place as a lush paradise now its trees are stripped of all 
greenery leaving a barren brown landscape riddled with rubble 
even so several residents predicted that the tourism industry on 
this island of 53000 will recover in a few years 
delamater was not quite so optimistic 
theres no way this place will recover in two years he said

a new highspeed rail line with trains that can go 
185 mph opened its first link between paris and western france on 
wednesday but the first two trains were late thanks to protesters 
the sleek locomotives are called tgv for the french train a 
grande vitesse or highspeed train they will cut traveling time 
from the capital to brest from 5 hours 33 minutes to just under 
four hours 
premier michel rocard praised the state railway societe nationale 
des chemin de fer or sncf as he inaugurated the line at 
montparnasse and predicted the service would prove a technical 
financial and commercial success 
at a time when many were questioning whether the train was an 
obsolete form of transportation the sncf applied itself to proving 
the contrary rocard said it has given railwaymen confidence in 
the future 
but the first train of the day on the nantesle mansparis run 
was 12 minutes late and the second more than an hour protesters 
blocked the tracks and covered the trains with stickers to 
demonstrate against ticket prices 
prices on the new lines are subject to a peaktime sliding scale 
for the onehour run from le mans to paris for example the oneway 
price can vary from 25 to 43 
in its first phase the tgv atlantic will serve 12 cities in 
northwestern france including angers brest guincamp la baule 
laval le croisic le mans morlaix nantes rennes st brieuc and 
st nazaire 
the service is to expand to the southwest in september 1990 with 
main lines running through the bordeaux wine country the toulouse 
region and the coastal resort of biarritz 
when complete the atlantic service will include 97 of the 
blueandsilver trains each with two electric engines and 10 
passenger cars 
the railway estimates their worth at about 121 billion new 
track and improvements to existing rails push the cost up a further 
15 billion 
the government hopes to offset part of the development cost by 
selling rolling stock and technology to other countries 
rocard said recent spanish and australian interest in the french 
technology shows the tgv has a future outside our borders 
the newgeneration tgv differs in some ways from its predecessor 
which has been running from paris to southern france since sept 27 
1981 
its top speed is 185 mph compared to 165 mph for the old model 
and rides more smoothly it also comes equipped with telephones as 
the sncf makes a push for business travelers 
the towns closest to paris along the new tgv line hope the trains 
will carry industry their way as well as passengers 
in le mans one hour from paris on the tgv compared to one hour 
40 minutes on standard rail the municipal government has invested 
in a complex of hotels hightechnology industries and office 
buildings in anticipation the tgv will bring economic growth

former opposition presidential 
candidate guillermo endara said wednesday he is going on a hunger 
strike to call attention to a campaign to cut revenues for the 
government installed by gen manuel antonio noriega 
from this moment im on a hunger strike until the not one 
penny more campaign is known and supported by the people of 
panama said endara who won the may 7 presidential election by a 
31 margin according to international observers 
the noriegacontrolled government annulled the vote and named a 
provisional president on sept 1 when the former presidents term 
was expired 
the opposition wants panamanians to avoid playing the government 
lottery gambling in casinos or betting on horse races to cut 
government revenue 
the government hurt by us economic sanctions has been 
depending on gambling revenues for much of its money 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since february 
1988 when he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in florida 
as commander of panamas defense forces noriega is the most 
powerful political and military figure in panama 
endara said he was initiating the hunger strike as a personal 
offering to a people who are suffering from hunger for justice 
democracy and liberty 
during this strike i will follow mohandas gandhis rules i 
wont eat anything and will limit myself to water medicine 
prescribed by my doctors and the sacred host when i take 
communion said the 53yearold endara 
the opposition has demanded that its may election victory be 
recognized and that noriega step down as defense forces chief 
the government instead appointed economist francisco rodriguez as 
provisional president and said the situation would be reviewed in 
february to determine if new elections would be called 
endara conceded that the opposition campaign could affect the 
income of lottery ticket sellers but asked for understanding he 
said ticket sellers could set up their own raffles and asked the 
public to take part if that happened 
endara said he would be staying in opposition party headquarters 
in a room furnished with a chair and a small bed

president bush on wednesday ordered more than a 
thousand us military police to the virgin islands to help 
restore order in the aftermath of hurricane hugo and suppress 
widespread looting 
the pentagon announced later wednesday night that two mp 
battalions of three companies each and a headquarters unit would 
arrive in the virgin islands in 16 air force transports early 
thursday morning 
some confusion over the origins of the decision to act arose 
later wednesday night though bush said the governor of the islands 
requested the troops the governor denied doing so a white house 
spokesman steve hart said later the governors denial was 
contrary to the information i have 
a presidential executive order said members of the armed forces 
of the united states will be used to suppress the violence in the 
virgin islands 
presidential assistant james cicconi was asked what orders would 
be given the troops about the use of force he replied im sure 
theyd use only that which was necessary and appropriate 
a pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
by name said troops would not arrive before daylight because there 
appeared to be no lights available to guide landing planes 
top generals met in the underground operations center at the 
pentagon to work out details of dispatching the 720th mp battalion 
and its companies from fort polk la fort hood texas and fort 
leonard wood mo totaling about 470 people the 503rd mp battalion 
and its companies all from fort bragg nc with about 560 and the 
16th mp brigade headquarters from fort bragg with another 75 
the mps will take three oh58 helicopters some of their vehicles 
and appropriate medical support aboard 16 c141 starlifter 
transports said the pentagon announcement 
army spokesman lt col keith schneider said the soldiers would 
take with them their individually assigned weapons he did not 
specify what those weapons were but mps usually carry a pistol 
the troops would join us marshals and fbi agents on st croix 
where and armed coast guardsmen landed from cutters earlier 
wednesday troops already had been ordered to help relief efforts in 
puerto rico 
i have been informed that conditions of domestic violence and 
disorder exist in and about the virgin islands bush said in a 
statement 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush authorized the 
deployment to the us virgin islands of such department of defense 
forces as are necessary 
defense secretary dick cheney was visiting the marine airground 
combat center at twentynine palms calif the pentagon official 
said cheney has been kept informed and would not interrupt his 
trip 
the last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in 
1968 in washington dc after the assassination of martin luther 
king 
president reagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to deal 
with prison riots in atlanta but that trouble subsided before they 
were deployed 
meanwhile attorney general dick thornburgh ordered 100 us 
marshals and fbi agents to st croix said justice department 
spokesman david runkel 
they will protect federal officials and property but their 
presence would also help bolster local law enforcement runkel said 
a small team of fbi agents was sent in to set up a command post 
earlier wednesday armed coast guard crewmen from at least one of 
the six coast guard ships in the area went ashore on st croix to 
help restore order after national guardsmen and police reportedly 
joined prison escapees and others in wild looting by machetearmed 
mobs 
gunshots were fired and ham radio operators heard reports that 
inmates had either escaped or been released because of prison damage 
and were looting 
tourists pleaded with reporters landing on the island to take 
them off coast guard cutters evacuated frightened tourists and 
residents 
usually the national guard would be used in such cases but the 
situation in the virgin islands was unclear officials said 
we cant be sure whats happening weve heard the reports of 
looting said another pentagon official who also spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a spokesman for the pentagons national guard bureau maj bob 
dunlap said the reports of looting by national guardsmen were not 
confirmed 
federal law normally prohibits the use of regular military 
forces which in peacetime does not include the coast guard as 
civilian law enforcement officers the president does have to power 
to use troops in that way if he finds local law enforcement is not 
up to the job 
fitzwater said bush was authorizing use of the troops including 
military police units to help restore order in the aftermath of 
hurricane hugo 
the presidents decision was based on a thorough assessment of 
the situation by appropriate federal authorities and followed a 
request this afternoon from gov alexander farrelly of the us 
virgin islands requesting federal assistance 
bushs proclamation headed law and order in the virgin 
islands said he was taking the action because the law 
enforcement resources available to that territory including the 
national guard are unable to suppress such acts of violence and to 
restore law and order 
bush on wednesday declared the virgin islands a disaster area and 
his spokesman said a similar declaration was expected soon for 
puerto rico 
on tuesday night bush directed the pentagon to make defense 
department troops and equipment available for relief efforts in 
puerto rico fitzwater said 
us forces stationed in puerto rico were to help restore 
electricity and water on the island he said it was the first such 
presidential authorization under a disaster assistance act passed by 
congress last year 
fitzwater said also that the interior department had made 
available 500000 for immediate use in the us virgin islands 
he said the money would be spent to buy food emergency supplies and 
safety items 
fitzwater said that the us military was providing a variety of 
cargo planes personnel and equipment for relief efforts in the 
stricken areas

the governor of the virgin islands said 
wednesday night he did not ask for the federal troops ordered to the 
island by president bush 
interviewed by telephone by ap network news from his offices in 
charlotte amalie gov alexander farrelly said we spoke to 
washington as to whether if we requested assistance under the 
control of my adjutant general whether that would be ok 
and we got the impression that if we asked for help we would 
get it 
the adjutant general is the top national guard officer there 
have been reports that national guard troops joined looters in the 
islands 
asked whether he had in fact asked for federal help in restoring 
order farrelly said we have not done so yet 
white house spokesman steve hart informed of farrellys remarks 
said thats contrary to the information i have 
hart said the white house would stand by its earlier statement 
which said in part the presidents decision was based on a 
thorough assessment of the situation by appropriate federal 
authorities and followed a request this afternoon from gov 
alexander farrelly of the us virgin islands requesting federal 
assistance 
told that troops were being sent to the islands farrelly said 
that may or not be correct i cant tell you that 
bush has ordered two military police battalions and a 
headquarters unit totalling about 1100 men to the islands to 
restore order 
there was this exchange with the governor 
q so if troops are being sent to the island they are not being 
sent at your request 
a not yet 
as to reports of looting and rioting the governor said there 
is some looting no doubt about that but there is no near state of 
anarchy and i should know im in the streets every day and im the 
governor of this territory

eampj gallo winery the worlds 
largest winemaker on wednesday stopped selling its highalcohol 
thunderbird and night train brands to retailers in skid rows 
throughout the country 
the skid rows were not identified 
thunderbird and night train cheaply made with a hint of wine 
flavor and laced with grape brandy to make them about 18 percent 
alcohol usually sell for 90 cents to 150 for a screwtop 
threequarter liter bottle 
gallo which accounts for more than 26 percent of us wine sales 
and reportedly has annual sales of more than 1 billion said it 
would wait six months to see whether the removal makes any 
difference 
the company called the wines an affordable alternative to other 
alcoholic beverages a wine industry economist estimated that 
gallo annually sells about nine million gallons or about four 
million cases of these wines 
gallos move ordered by chairman ernest gallo follows by about 
three months the removal of the brands from groceries in san 
franciscos derelictinhabited tenderloin district 
a drive to get the wines off tenderloin shelves was started by 
safe and sober streets a citizen group which complained that 
resident were harassed and attacked by drunks drinking gallo and 
other cheap wines 
gallo challenged the communities where skid rows and winos exist 
to enforce laws to prevent sellers of highalcohol wines from 
dealing with alcoholics 
gallos announcement wednesday said the company was convinced 
that most people who drink the socalled fortified wines are many 
thousands of moderate and responsible consumers many of whom are 
retired and on fixed incomes 
gallo said it was regrettable that a few retailers sell the 
wines to obvious alcoholic derelicts 
this practice has led to the assertion that these products 
cause skid row conditions and therefore that stopping the sale of 
highproof wine the problem of skid row can be solved the winery 
said 
we believe this thinking is naive and that the use of these 
products on skid row is merely a symptom and not a cause 
gallo said the derelict problem will never be solved until 
state and local regulatory agencies enforce existing laws which 
forbid retailers from selling alcoholic beverages of any kind to the 
habitual drunkard

heeding pleas to give el salvadors new 
president a chance to succeed the senate voted wednesday to 
boost his countrys aid to 90 million for the coming year and 
remove restrictions on the money 
on a vote of 6733 the lawmakers stripped from a 144 billion 
foreign aid bill a provision that would have cut the aid into three 
slices to be sent at fourmonth intervals and would have given 
congress what amounted to veto power over the final installment 
minutes later they approved a substitute that would increase the 
military aid from 85 million to 90 million and offered rhetorical 
praise for peace talks now taking place between the salvadoran 
government and the leftist fmln guerillas that vote was 8218 
to have attached strings to the aid would have been an unfair 
gesture of no confidence in salvadoran president alfredo cristiani 
at a time when there is a chance to end a decade of civil war in his 
country opponents of the restrictions argued cristiani was sworn 
in june 1 as the winning candidate of the rightist arena party 
it will be a blow to him politically at the very moment the 
very hour when we ought to be encouraging him to go forward 
said sen christopher dodd dconn who joined in a rare alliance 
with conservatives including sen jesse helms rnc to oppose 
the restrictions 
he is doing exactly what weve been trying to accomplish over 
the last 10 years we ought to give president cristiani a chance to 
succeed 
proponents of the restrictions led by sen patrick leahy dvt 
argued that cristianis party has been linked to deathsquad 
activity in the past and has still not completely eliminated human 
rights violations 
the senate still has to complete work on the overall aid measure 
then work out differences with the house before sending the bill to 
bush for his signature 
however the measure contained one provision which republicans 
said would alone be sufficient grounds for a presidential veto a 
prohibition on using us aid to other countries as bait to get 
those countries to carry out policies which are prohibited by us 
law the restriction grew out of the irancontra affair in which 
the united states pressured other nations to aid the nicaraguan 
contras despite a ban on direct us aid to the rebels 
sen richard lugar rind sought to redraft the section at the 
request of the state department but failed on a vote of 5741 
the annual foreign aid money bill pays for a wide variety of 
programs aimed at bolstering the military power of friendly 
countries supporting economic development and giving direct 
infusions to foreign governments 
in the first concrete gesture of congressional disenchantment 
with bushs response to eastern europe the bill contained 45 
million for economic aid to poland substantially bettering the 
administrations 10 million request for next year 
poland has for the first time in more than four decades elected a 
noncommunistdominated government making it an irresistible target 
for rewards by lawmakers 
as they worked through a series of other controversial issues in 
the bill the lawmakers voted 5248 to reverse a fouryearold 
policy and resume us aid to the united nations population fund 
over objections that the fund supports chinese forcedabortion 
policies 
lawmakers backed a provision in the bill providing 15 million to 
the united nations population control agency which last received 
us money in 1985 the reagan administration shut off aid then in 
light of charges that china has a onechildperfamily policy 
enforced through compulsory sterilization and abortions president 
bush has continued that policy 
the peoples republic of china continues to engage in 
ethically heinous grievous violations of the human rights of 
parents and of unborn children argued sen gordon humphrey 
rnh an abortion opponent 
but the sponsor of the policy change sen barbara mikulski 
dmd said even the state departments agency for international 
development has found that while the un agency operates in china it 
does not engage in or support such objectionable policies she 
included in her provision a stipulation that all us money be kept 
in a separate account and that none of it go to pay for operations 
in china 
as usual the largest recipients of aid in the bill are israel 
and egypt a reward for their participation in the camp david peace 
process israel would get 18 billion in military aid and 12 
billion in economic assistance and egypt would get 13 billion in 
military and 815 million in economic aid 
another large benefit would go to the philippines which would 
get at least 160 million toward the us share in a multinational 
economic development program led by japan that amount was 40 
million less than bush asked for 
other money was earmarked for pakistan 230 million each in 
military and economic aid 565 million in development aid for 
africa 500 million in military aid for turkey 350 million in 
military aid for greece 115 million for the war on drugs 615 
million for the exportimport bank and 370 million for refugee 
programs

in out of the cold mcnamara faults the united states for 
skeptical unimaginative and very cautious responses to

the soviet leaders ideas have been so dramatic so 
revolutionary as to literally imply a desire to end the cold war

pentagon in the kennedy and johnson administrations and then headed 
the world bank 
mcnamara finished writing the book in april he does not mention

initiatives but his views run parallel to those recently expressed 
by a number of democrats who say the president lacks imagination in

looking around artist tyree guytons neighborhood 
some people see abandoned drug and prostitution houses and vacant 
lots strewn with broken glass and garbage 
guyton sees hypocrisy 
to convey that vision artistically he has taken over five 
abandoned houses and at least as many lots and decorated them with 
hundreds of discards he has collected over nearly three years from 
hubcaps to armless baby dolls old shoes to street signs 
i see things around me and i want to make people aware of 
whats going on said the 33yearold artist 
these kids are in an area where they see nothing but trouble 
whats to stop them from becoming criminals 
one sculpture of painted doors on heidelberg street symbolizes 
the closing of doors in a childs face and the opening of a door 
for someone to climb out of a rut the artist said 
in another project baby doll house he festooned an 
abandoned drug house with scores of dolls some naked and dirty 
some hanging upside down some aboard broomsticks 
each doll represents something guyton said in an interview 
before the building long on the citys demolition list was razed 
they tell the horrors of drugs and the pity of a neglected child 
as one of 10 children in a singleparent home guyton knows 
neglect through an addicted brother hes observed drug abuse he 
hopes his art will warn children away from drugs 
few neighbors understand guytons art but some think it has 
improved the looks of the neighborhood 
every time i look out my front door i wonder what color the 
bench will be that day said tina bell who lives two lots east of 
guytons blue twostory woodframe house spared decoration other 
than an oftenchanging sculpture on the front porch 
bell said she remembers guytons first project fun house 
initially she said she thought her neighbor was crazy 
he told me these were the things that were going on in his 
head she said i cant always see his statements but i know 
its there 
anthony dicus has a personal interest in one of the objects 
that turquoise bike hanging on the tree is my first bike 
said the 24yearold dicus one mans garbage is another mans 
art 
guytons art is beginning to look more and more like garbage to 
some neighbors and a detroit city council member who say it is 
becoming an eyesore 
if beauty is in the eye of the beholder this guy must be

the movies plot is this the bouffants split 
up after their only hit song 25 years ago they havent seen or 
spoken to each other until theyre reluctantly reunited for a 
nostalgic television special 
but it takes a lot of persuasion to get the trio played by sandy 
duncan jill eikenberry and judith light to reprise their hit on 
the nbc movie my boyfriends back which also is the name of 
their song 
duncan sympathizes with her blastfromthepast character 
its awful to live long enough to see your music become 
nostalgia she says then adding i love the music of the 60s 
its feelgood music its snap your fingers and dance it was 
before the protest music 
the movie which also stars stephen macht alan feinstein and 
robert costanzo will air monday it follows nbcs the hogan 
family in which duncan plays the divorced sister of a widower with 
three sons 
my boyfriends back may bring happy memories for rock n 
roll fans particularly those who now are fortysomething 
it features cameo appearances by mary wells doing my guy 
gary puckett singing young girl gary lewis reprising this 
diamond ring and peggy march doing likewise with i will follow 
him 
in the film it is explained that the bouffants after their solo 
hit broke up after arguments between eikenberrys and lights 
characters over who would be lead singer duncan was the peacemaker 
i wasnt the lead singer said duncan who starred in peter 
pan on broadway my kids didnt understand that jill was the 
lead singer and judith and i were the backups 
in the film a television producer working on a 60s 
retrospective finds the three singers one by one and brings them 
together there have been some changes since their bouffant days 
duncan is married to a sportscaster played by feinstein and has 
children eikenberry is now an executive of a large cosmetics 
company and her singing career is a wellkept secret light never 
gave up her dream but now she sings in bowling alleys and lounges 
when they reunite duncan said its a coming of age thing 
since were now in our 40s the three of us really hit it off 
but its a rough go at first she explained because eikenberrys 
character doesnt want to commit to the show when things dont 
work out she walks away my character is the one who makes it work 
and look easy 
any one of the three of us could have played any role there 
are aspects of ourselves in each character when we get back 
together were loving and fighting all over again each walks away 
from the experience with a new sense of her own identity 
ensemble singing is not the easiest of tasks but the three 
costars recorded their characters group vocalizing in the film 
we do our own singing duncan said jill did a broadway 
musical while i was doing peter pan judith has done a lot of 
singing in summer stock we certainly sing well enough for what we 
were required to do 
duncan enjoyed making the film one reason for her enjoyment 
it was wonderful to be on a show where they dont have food 
fights 
i showed a tape of it to my father she said i guess he 
liked it he said at least i didnt fall asleep during it 
the actress recently returned from paris where the hogan 
family filmed a threepart story about the familys visit to 
france the episodes began monday and will conclude oct 2 
the plot is the standard one for a european visit a member of 
the cast jason bateman in this case falls in love with a girl who 
turns out to be a princess 
its a travelogue duncan said we stood in front of every 
landmark in paris we ended up with a ball in a hotel and i danced 
with a count we were there for two weeks then came back and 
went back to work immediately to finish the interiors 
duncan said her next project will be to develop a tv movie called 
mountain charley based on the true story of a woman who led a 
double life as a woman and a man in the 1800s

the japanese may appear to be the worlds most avid 
consumers of luxury goods but theyre just as enthusiastic about 
stashing money in the bank 
japans 39 million households held an average of about 130000 
in personal savings last year according to a recent report by the 
bank of japan 
total personal savings rose 114 percent to 515 trillion in 
1988 more tha double the 45 percent growth in consumer spending 
it was the third straight year that personal savings grew at 
doubledigit rates the figures count savings deposited at banks and 
postal offices or held in the form of stocks bonds and insurance 
it was also a clear indication that the japanese havent 
abandoned their habit of saving a substantial part of their incomes 
in financial assets 
japanese are more likely to put their money into paper property 
while americans are more likely to invest in housing 
housing is not counted in personal savings figures which is one 
reason the reported savings rate is much lower in the united states 
5 percent to 6 percent than in japan 16 percent says richard c 
koo senior economist at nomura research institute 
the habit of saving has created a massive pool of capital for 
japanese industry a foundation of japans powerhouse economy 
while the value of land in japan tends to appreciate housing 
actually depreciates people know that their houses will not be 
worth much 10 years from now so they dont invest in housing koo 
said 
americans put their savings into keeping their homes up 
because they expect them to appreciate in value he explained 
traditionally housing in japan vulnerable to earthquakes and 
fires has been torn down and rebuilt rather than maintained 
numerous surveys say the japanese put money into savings rather 
than housing to prepare for illness and disaster for retirement and 
education fees for children 
ive always stashed whatever i could in the bank so id have a 
nice nest egg said seitarou komatsu 41 an employee of a major 
japanese industrial firm 
the prospect of long years of retirement is a crucial reason 
behind the high savings rate in japan average life expectancy here 
is 821 years for women and 759 years for men while the mandatory 
retirement age at many companies is 55 to 60 
the japanese are much less confident about the future than 
americans in many ways said koo they know how much things cost 
here and theyre wise to prepare for their old age 
the expansion of twoincome families has contributed to the 
growth in personal savings along with rising values of financial 
assets 
the average monthly wage for a japanese worker in a company with 
30 employees or more was 2317 while monthly spending per 
household averages 2000 
averages tend to distort the actual level of savings per 
individual family 
a survey by the management and coordination agency of 6000 
families nationwide showed average family savings of more than 
61000 in 1988 but median savings per household of only a little 
more than 14000 
this indicated that the savings of a wealthy few tend to skew the 
average with the majority of families holding much more modest nest 
eggs the median is the dividing line where half the households have 
more savings and half have less 
families of aged persons hold the largest savings 386000 in 
average cash assets according to a poll of 2000 elderly couples 
conducted by the tokai bank in 1988 
theres a lot of very very rich people including anyone with 
land in tokyo but most people are pennypinching their way through 
wondering how to plan their old age koo said

soviet leaders apparently have decided the best 
way to win converts to atheism is to grant greater religious 
freedoms say western participants in a dialogue between humanists 
and atheists in moscow 
delegates from the international humanist and ethical union and 
the soviet institute for scientific atheism concluded that more than 
seven decades of militant atheism have been selfdefeating in 
swaying soviet believers from their faith 
its my opinion the situation in poland made the russians aware 
that attacking religion may paradoxically support it rob tielman 
a copresident of the humanist union said in a telephone interview 
from his home in the netherlands by giving freedom to religion 
the russians hope atheism will develop in a more positive way 
the july dialogue was the first in a planned series of meetings 
between soviet atheists and western humanists a soviet delegation 
has been invited to the 11th humanist world congress in brussels 
belgium in august 1990 
humanists distance themselves from doctrinaire atheism by saying 
that although they reject belief in god they stand for human 
freedom including religious freedom 
paul kurtz a copresident of the humanist union and a philosophy 
professor at the state university of new york at buffalo said he 
thinks the humanists receive an insight others dont get into 
soviet thinking because the soviets view them as comrades in 
theology because of their shared skepticism of religion 
soviet attempts to supplant religion with atheism ranging from 
persecution of religious to the introduction of naming 
celebrations to replace baptisms have failed soviet delegates 
told western participants 
under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev tielman said the 
soviet union has decided to take a more practical approach 
recognizing that soviet society needs less mistrustful citizens if 
it hopes to enlist them in rebuilding its shattered economy 
they seem to be moving toward a policy of a neutral state a 
neutral view of religion said kurtz atheism will no longer be 
the official doctrine 
kurtz said they were told by soviet atheists that 2000 churches 
have reopened in the past two years seven new seminaries will open 
in the fall and the publication of limited editions of the bible 
and the koran the islamic holy book has been permitted 
on his own visit to arbat street in moscow kurtz said he even 
noticed hare krishnas were being permitted to proselytize 
in july the vatican appointed a bishop in the soviet republic of 
byelorussia the first bishop there since the aftermath of the 
russian revolution several religious leaders have been elected to 
the new soviet parliament including russian orthodox patriarch 
pimen metropolitan pitirim head of church publishing leningrad 
metroplitan alexei and armenian catholicos vaskin i 
for jews greater tolerance by the kremlin has meant a rise in 
emigration an eightyear high of 20000 jews departed in 1988 
less harassment at jewish holiday celebrations and the opening of a 
private jewish museum and library in moscow 
within the soviet union many still seek greater religious 
freedom last sunday tens of thousands of ukrainian catholics 
marched through the city of lvov demanding legal status for their 
church 
the human rights organization amnesty international says soviet 
citizens still can be prosecuted for exercising freedom of religion 
but tielman and kurtz said the soviets indicated they learned a 
lesson from poland where an entrenched roman catholic church 
prevailed over official attempts to limit its influence 
in poland tielman said in a way they forced people that were 
not sympathetic to the communist party into the church 
the humanist leaders said soviet atheists were particularly 
concerned about the growth of moslem fundamentalism up to 50 
million moslems live in soviet central asia 
the advice the humanists gave the soviets if you want to beat 
the church dont turn atheism into a form of state religion 
one of the reasons why atheism did not succeed completely is 
that it was identified completely with party politics tielman 
said 
the humanist delegation encouraged the soviets to allow people 
who do not believe in god to meet in private groups free of state 
control to promote atheism as an alternative to religion 
we dont believe the state should either promote theism or 
atheism kurtz said the key point is the free mind any 
effort by the state to repress it is going to be counterproductive

more than six million members of the labor force 
are without work but many companies are having a hard time filling 
goodpaying entry jobs that require no special skills and no 
experience 
the rare situation isnt a national phenomenon but it could 
become one already it exists in pockets in most geographical areas 
of the country from border to border and coast to coast 
in wilton conn a supermarket with excellent progressive 
salary scale paid holidays vacations sick pay life insurance 
medical plan and pension must advertise for parttimers at 650 
an hour 
the jobs as clerks and cashiers require no experience because 
the company trains those it hires and raises their hourly rate to 
685 after six months those assigned to night shifts begin at 
760 an hour 
not many years ago such jobs would be snapped up before the 
employer advertised there might have been a waiting list too and 
some people would have considered themselves lucky to be on it 
times have changed 
the situation results from an economy operating at the limit of 
its ability to produce new workers the us labor supply is 
growing but at a feeble rate likely to average less than 15 
percent a year into the 1990s 
it is forcing companies such as the supermarket and fastfood 
outlets into niche hiring or finding workers who might not 
ordinarily be in the labor force such as 15yearolds homemakers 
and the retired 
attention senior citizens declares a headline in the 
supermarket ad we welcome seniors who long to get back into 
the work force a parttime position with stop amp shop can help you 
 
supplement your income 
develop a new social outlet 
become a role model for younger employees 
beneath it is another headline attention 15yearolds we have 
positions available for you to earn money and spend the proper 
amount of time on schoolwork 
how can this be when in august 64 million workers were 
unemployed these werent labor force dropouts in order to be 
included in the work force they must have been actively looking for 
work and obviously not finding it 
sociologists never will run out of explanations 
the unemployed list constantly changes many of those listed as 
jobless are merely between jobs temporarily unemployed and all but 
assured of finding work within a few weeks 
national figures do not apply locally in some areas the jobless 
rate is even lower than 5 percent 
the jobs are inappropriate for skilled adults 
high as the beginning pay is almost double the minimum wage 
it is insufficient in communities where rents might run 1000 a 
month and public transportation might not serve the job site 
some job seekers cannot pass basic health or competency tests 
may have police records may have demonstrated in previous jobs that 
they are unreliable some may have chemical dependency problems 
some just dont want to work though they remain in the work 
force and for the record are looking for work 
employers therefore must seek new sources audrey freedman a 
conference board analyst says two likely niches are the 14 million 
women who stay home with the kids and 33 million early retirees 
youngsters are another 
however even this group is reduced by sickness and by life 
styles that do not leave time for work under examination it quickly 
reduces 
moreover some of these people though not officially in the 
work force have jobs from time to time official data show only 19 
percent of americans between ages 20 and 65 remain out of the work 
force all year long 
in order to makes themselves attractive niche employers also 
have to create niche jobs in some of these jobs for example the 
hours are whatever the employee chooses to work the employer is 
happy to adapt 
in the short term a recession could reverse the situation 
conceivably making people line up for such positions if the economy 
continues to expand however niches are likely to be part of the 
scene for several more years

nervous laughter and friendly small talk floated 
above the 17 whites and eight blacks closeted in a hot conference 
room 
five minutes later it was quiet 
charles h king minister civil rights activist and former 
professor had just told the whites they are the reason racism 
thrives in america 
they were clearly offended 
before long a furious black woman lunged at an argumentative 
white man two feet away the air rang with teary curses from the 
woman and shouts from king 
the races were separated shaken blacks shuttled into another 
room where some cried equally shaken whites discussed what they saw 
and why they did not intervene on the womans behalf some were 
beginning to believe king was right 
then came illustrations of the black mans raw deal in slides 
recordings and diagrams on a blackboard 
in the end everybody came out smiling agreeing with the king 
theory bigotry reigns because 1 white people let it 2 they 
want it that way and 3 black people are all but powerless against 
it 
companies are sending executives and office managers to race 
relations seminars hoping to create understanding that can be 
applied in the workplace the workshops also have found their way 
into courts ku klux klansmen agreed to a seminar as part of the 
settlement of a lawsuit stemming from a 1979 clash between klan 
members and black civil rights marchers in alabama 
king has been at it for 20 years and has instructed at least 28 
others on his technique to send it into companies across the country 
generally the workshop puts people on uncomfortable chairs in 
uncomfortable rooms for anywhere from four hours to two days 
forcing frank often heated discussion of what racism is and isnt 
i had no idea of what the black person experiences said 
robert miskimins a white sales executive for chicagobased inland 
steel now i think more black because im more aware of what 
blacks feel 
it reaffirmed my blackness it made me feel good about me 
said linda eastman one of miskimins coworkers it made me feel 
better able to articulate my feelings in an intellectual way 
inland sent 19 employees mostly from its sales department to 
kings workshop one black sales executive oliver copeland said he 
hopes to learn kings technique in order to start an inhouse 
program by 1990 
the workshops aim to enlighten whites through oppression there 
are no apologies from king who pioneered the technique in 1968 
during an angry moment in a allwhite class he taught at an ohio 
college 
they were just arguing back with me and i really gave them all 
the feeling and anger i had no matter what you say if its to a 
black persons favor and a white persons detriment they always 
argue back 
when you directly approach a white person with emotion they 
begin feeling for the first time in their lives what blacks are 
saying 
the rev ct vivian a civil rights activist who learned his 
workshop technique from king said demand for his 14yearold 
seminar rose meteorically after it was dramatized on the oprah 
winfrey show this year they saw something that worked people 
are concerned about racism but they just dont want to talk about it 
because they feel its useless to talk about it 
vivians black action strategies amp information center workshop 
booked solid through january 1990 and already has march dates 
king who has run seminars for federal agencies ranging from the 
defense department to the fbi will do one for the navy in germany 
later this year his pace has been slowed by recent cancer surgery 
but hes booked through the year 
theyre vying for space he said i have to turn people 
down now 
both workshops teach that discrimination and prejudice toward one 
black affects all blacks that blacks often undergo racial identity 
crises when they are placed in a white environment that whites are 
prejudiced because of what they were taught and blacks because of 
the way theyve been treated and that whites profess to be ignorant 
of racism in order to avoid it 
participants arrive thinking they may not like what they hear 
theyre often not wrong 
there is no reason for a white male to not succeed in this 
country king shouted during a recent workshop what do you have 
holding you back youre not black youre not women 
we all cant be president one white participant said 
king whirled in anger 
dont get smart with me dont try to change the subject move 
it to that level that aint what were talking about 
inland steels edna west was arguing with a white coworker when 
she branded all white people with an obscene description 
another man in the workshop intervened and so did king 
dont interrupt an angry black woman dont try to stop black 
anger what do you want to stop her for 
ms west said afterward that the confrontation showed me i 
shouldnt just sit back and silently condone what they continue to 
do 
king asked blacks to describe what it is like to work in a 
majority white situation they spoke of isolation despair dashed 
hopes for promotions 
king said any progressivethinking businessman would want to 
combat those feelings because thats a stick of dynamite in your 
personnel file 
for that exact reason an atlanta business forum leadership 
atlanta has been sending participants to kings urban crisis inc 
workshops for 13 years said spokeswoman elaine alexander about 800 
of the 1200 executives who have gone through leadership atlanta 
also went through kings workshop 
virtually everyone who participates in one of dr kings 
seminars is changed by it alexander said its a very emotional 
experience it enhances their sensitivity toward the total 
community 
eightysix percent of business participants and 94 percent from 
colleges said in followup surveys by basic that the seminars had 
changed their outlooks on race vivian said 
its a beautiful thing to see man black people say yeah 
weve seen em change here but how long is it going to last but 
up to 94 percent effectiveness on an issue as deeply emotional as 
this

thirty years ago a friend gave dr henry 
crane a lakeside boat ramp so hed have easy access to his home on 
an island in squam lake one of new hampshires largest and 
prettiest 
crane opened the ramp to all comers making it the only free 
public access to big and little squam lakes scene of the 1981 movie 
on golden pond 
few know about cranes ramp it isnt on maps and locals dont 
go out of their way to advertise it public access for a price is 
almost as bad the few facilities open to the public handle only 
small boats or have limited parking 
squam is one of 1021 lakes new hampshire owns for the public 
benefit it illustrates how the state while touting outdoor 
recreation as part of its high quality of life has relinquished 
much of its stewardship to lakefront owners 
about 500 lakes including squam have no stateowned access 
virtually excluding those unable to afford property selling for an 
average 2000 a foot of shorefront on new hampshires largest 
lake winnipesaukee the state owns one park and one public boat 
ramp along 240 miles of shoreline 
rather than buy access the state traditionally has relied on the 
good will of people like crane and lake associations that open areas 
to the public 
i think that lake belongs to the public said crane 70 i 
guess im oldfashioned 
such hospitality is disappearing and even when there is access 
said state sen roger heath lake associations and many residents 
have a slightly conspiratorial attitude not to post access 
points 
such silence by townspeople has proven an effective way to 
restrict usage since the state has no published map or list of ways 
to get to the water 
gov judd gregg has called improving lake access a priority but 
critics find little encouraging in the states recent record 
though land has been added to some parks the last new state park 
with water access was built more than 20 years ago new hampshire 
has no park on squam lake its second largest or on another large 
lake winnisquam though it owns undeveloped land there a new state 
program given 38 million to preserve open space has bought a dozen 
properties with access mostly to rivers its most notable purchase 
is a wilderness area far from population and tourism centers 
from 1940 to 1979 the state using mostly federal funds built 
or bought 250 shallowdraft boat ramps for fishermen but only 110 
are functional 
the program contained no money for maintenance bathrooms trash 
disposal or parking some of the narrow roads to ramps are 
overgrown others have been taken over by land owners towns 
complain that neglect makes them garbage dumps and teen hangouts 
some want ownership so they can close them to outsiders 
the states 2yearold attempt to regulate boat moorings the 
poor mans dock on five large lakes also has failed to increase 
public access when it regulated moorings the state gave shorefront 
owners the power to veto permits letting strangers moor in front of 
their property even though the moorings are on state waters over 
state land the tradeoff was the creation of two types of mooring 
fields one for use by anyone the other for grous like sailing 
clubs 
dozens of applications have been filed and approved for 
restricted fields but only one has been approved for the public 
the lone public operator is merrill fay owner of fays boat yard 
on lake winnipesaukee who says requirements for a public field are 
so stringent that few could afford to put one in aside from 
bathrooms and similar amenities the state requires a boat taxi 
service dinghy docking access to highways and liability insurance 
the state also controls rental fees 
the state restricted moorings assuming towns would use some of 
their property around the lake for public fields said robert 
danos until recently the supervisor of the state marine patrol 
its not being done 
some say there is much the state could be doing and at little 
cost 
every time a condominium development has been given 50 docks 
they shouldve said you dedicate 10 of them to public use said 
fay everybody ought to be helping out 
until recently the state routinely granted requests for major 
dock developments like marinas in perpetuity dock developers now 
get renewable leases but older marinas are taking advantage of the 
old policy to sell slips for thousands of dollars the state has not 
challenged such sales as a change in use subject to state review 
as the demand for lake access has grown it has spread to 
smaller uncrowded lakes prompting residents to pressure lawmakers 
for controls an effort to ban jet skis is but one example the 
conflict has even led to talk of limiting the number of outsiders 
allowed on public waters on a given day 
heath would rather see more public access the state has walked 
away from it we make so much of our lakes and rightfully so we 
ought to let some of our citizens get on them and enjoy them

outside the battered metal doors of intermediate 
school 117 in east harlem crack vials litter the pavement and row 
after row of tenements stand empty and graffitiscarred 
but inside is what president bush has called the single most 
promising idea in education an idea certain to be high on the 
agenda at the education summit this week between bush and the 
nations governors in charlottesville va 
the idea is choice the belief as espoused by bush and 
others that if parents are allowed to choose the best public 
schools for their children the resulting competition would compel 
schools everywhere to improve 
minnesota iowa and arkansas have already adopted open 
enrollment plans permitting parents to choose among schools 
throughout those states many other states offer more limited choice 
options aimed at gifted students or youngsters with academic 
problems that only certain districts can handle scores of local 
districts have offered magnet and alternative programs for years 
a gallup education survey in august found americans support the 
principle of school choice by a 6031 margin with 9 percent saying 
they werent sure 
minnesotas plan voluntary for two years became mandatory this 
fall for districts with at least 1000 students in iowa a law 
signed this year gives students the right to apply to any school in 
the state they must stick with their choice for at least four years 
arkansas this year passed a comprehensive open enrollment law 
permitting students aged 5 through 18 to choose schools across 
district lines as long as there is room and as long as it doesnt 
upset desegregation efforts 
but advocates say no place offers better proof than east harlem 
that choices benefits can extend even to urban americas neediest 
in 1972 district 4 ranked last among new york citys 32 school 
districts in reading and math achievement only 15 percent read at 
or above grade level 
with federal and private funds thensuperintendent anthony 
alvarado gradually broke up or replaced existing schools in the 
district with magnet schools and alternative schools within 
schools small enough to give students individual attention and 
academically attractive enough to draw pupils from all over the city 
some are selective like the gifted programs or the school for 
the performing arts others take nearly all comers 
the district has weathered some recent problems last december 
superintendent carlos medina was suspended on allegations he and 
fellow board members funneled district money into a secret bank 
account and used it for trips food liquor and improper loans 
and citywide school budget cuts may force reductions this year in 
some of the districts innovative magnet programs said assistant 
superintendent john falco 
still everyone agrees the district has been transformed for the 
better by the bracing effects of competition 
even keith geiger president of the national education 
association which has given only qualified support to the idea of 
choice calls district 4 choice at its very best 
today reading scores of district 4s 14000 pupils rank 16th in 
the city and 65 percent read at grade level or higher pupils can 
choose among 23 alternative schools specializing in such areas as 
science and humanities performing arts and environmental science 
choice has also meant that poor programs which no longer attract 
students dont last a school specializing in maritime science was 
closed about three years ago falco said it reopened recently with 
a new director 
is 117 was once a failing impersonal middle school bulging 
with more than 2000 students it now houses four academies or 
schools within schools each occupying one floor and each with only 
about 200 pupils there is a gifted and talented program the 
harbor school for the performing arts the career academy 
which helps poorly prepared students take a seemingly outlandish 
goal such as becoming a lawyer and plan how to attain it and the 
key school with classes of no more than 18 students and 
intensive instruction for youngsters with emotional difficulties 
most pupils come from east harlem but the magnet schools are so 
appealing that this oncedowntrodden district is drawing students of 
all races and economic circumstances from every corner of the city 
nearly 200 children from around the city applied for 70 places in 
the entering class of the harbor school this year says assistant 
director harold roth 
fourthgrader chenoa rommereim takes a car pool each day from the 
bronx to attend is 117s gifted program she is one of the 
estimated 1525 percent nonminority students in district 4 magnet 
programs falco said 
even staunch supporters of choice note its limitations district 
4 has shunned choice for elementary schools falco said because at 
that early age its more important for parents and children to 
maintain neighborhood ties 
sy fliegel an early architect of choice in district 4 recently 
wrote that choice worked in east harlem because it came gradually 
one school at a time and successful programs were kept small its 
far better to have parents clamoring for a few excellent programs 
than to offer lots of poor choices 
when i hear about a school district deciding to become a 
complete choice system in one blow i worry fliegel wrote 
and as the bush education summit approaches educators here greet 
their fame with a mix of pride and frustration 
some worry that district 4s accomplishments are being used to 
demonstrate that choice alone without additional money will fix 
the nations schools few here believe that choice is an educational 
cureall 
in the final analysis the folks in washington seem to be 
saying federal dollars arent necessary whats needed is to have 
more schools like that one said phil batton a computer and 
spanish teacher who has been at is 117 for 24 years 
i have two feelings said maria bonet director of northview 
tech a magnet school on east 116th street specializing in computers 
and writing its very positive that people are noticing us let 
them notice but send us more money

the salt of the earth the signs of the times the 
spirit is willing but the flesh is weak 
those wellworn phrases as william tyndale intended have become 
as familiar to the laborer as to the scholar incorporated into the 
king james bible they became part of common english while the 
author sank into obscurity 
david daniell who has edited tyndales 1534 new testament for 
modern readers regards the translator as a neglected giant of 
english prose 
i think the authorized king james version deserves its 
tremendous reputation except that it is a stolen reputation from 
tyndale and that is grossly unfair daniell said in an interview 
tyndale a 16th century scholarpriest was the first to 
translate scripture from the original hebrew and greek into english 
for that he was branded a heretic his books were burned and so 
eventually was he only a dozen of the books are said to survive 
tyndales translations were as much a threat to the powers that 
be another of his phrases as the samizdat manuscripts of 
banned books that were passed from hand to hand in the soviet union 
before the era of glasnost 
thomas more scholar chancellor to henry viii and eventual 
catholic martyr condemned tyndale as one of the hellhounds that 
the devil hath in his kennel 
for the new edition published by yale university press daniell 
rendered tyndales work in modern spelling but found no need to 
tamper with the text 
if you read tyndale particularly the new testament 
translation against any other prose of the 1530s you are 
astonished by its modern clarity said daniell senior lecturer in 
english at university college london 
tyndales power is in getting a greek that is the greek of the 
common people into an english that is the english of the common 
people with incredible beauty 
where the king james version differs from tyndale it often 
rejects the anglosaxon word or phrase for what daniell calls a 
selfconsciously posh alternative rooted in latin 
for instance tyndales the old things are gone became the 
former things are passed away in the king james version 
if readers prefer the latter then tyndale will be disliked and 
there is no way to mend it daniell writes in the introduction to 
the book 
he points also to the last verse of the sixth chapter of matthew 
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof says the king james 
bible while tyndale says for the day present hath ever enough of 
his own trouble 
one is mandarin one is saying you have to know the word 
sufficient its a latin word you have to be a little bit clever 
to understand jesus daniell said the other is saying no you 
dont because everyone can say each day hath enough of its own 
trouble 
john foxe who compiled the book of martyrs in 1563 tells of 
the young tyndale arguing theology with a scholar and exclaiming 
if god spare my life ere many years i will cause a boy that 
driveth the plow shall know more of the scripture than thou dost 
there had been earlier bibles in english prepared around 1400 by 
followers of john wycliffe but these were translated from the latin 
vulgate version in reaction the english bishops in 1408 banned 
biblical translations 
a century later reform was boiling in europe erasmus the great 
humanist scholar published a greek new testament and in 1517 
martin luther nailed his 95 theses to the church door 
tyndale born in 1494 in gloucestershire and a graduate of oxford 
university was caught up in the new ideas he offered his services 
as a translator to bishop cuthbert tunstall of london a friend of 
erasmus but was turned down 
tyndale moved to the continent in 1524 and published his first 
new testament translation in cologne in 1525 
tunstall was the most enthusiastic buyer consigning tyndales 
books to bonfires at the rear of st pauls cathedral 
more and tyndale exchanged insults in pamphlets that did neither 
man much credit but daniell said tyndale was right and more wrong 
on specific points of translation 
for instance tyndale translated the greek word ecclesia as 
congregations more following the vulgate thought it should be 
rendered as church 
likewise tyndale translated repentance something anyone 
could do at home where the vulgate said do penance which 
requires confession and the direction of a priest 
in 1535 tyndale was imprisoned in belgium and the following year 
he was strangled and his body burned at the stake ironically 
england by then was a protestant country and the stubbornly 
catholic thomas more had been beheaded a year before tyndales death 
as a pioneering translator daniell said tyndale had to invent 
some words including jehovah passover scapegoat peacemaker and 
mercy seat 
daniell included a glossary of words from tyndales time that 
have fallen into disuse advoutry adultery debite deputy earer 
plowman noosell train or nurture pyght pitched weet know 
and weenest supposes 
daniell said one or two words defied definition but i think 
there are only two and that tells a story about tyndale he said 
because he is writing in everyday english he is not going to use 
outlandish words

short lumpy and nearing middle age french actress josiane 
balasko makes her american debut when the prizewinning too good 
for you opens the 27th new york film festival 
written and directed by bertrand blier the movie won a special 
jury prize at this years cannes film festival and established 
balasko admired for her roles in sidesplitting french comedies 
as one of frances foremost actresses 
the film opens the annual festival friday with a special 
screening at avery fisher hall 
the festival will feature 26 other movies from the united states 
finland japan taiwan the soviet union great britain ireland 
burkina faso poland canada australia and hungary 
closing night on oct 9 will showcase bill forsyths breaking 
in an engaging story of two smalltime thieves written by john 
sayles and starring burt reynolds it is the festival debut for the 
scottish director of local hero and gregorys girl 
the festival will have a special avantgarde program devoted to 
new innovative works by abigail child warren sonbert and pat 
oneill 
too good for you is the story of a car dealer gerard 
depardieu who betrays his beautiful and refined wife carole 
bouquet by falling passionately and inexplicably in love with 
his ordinarylooking overweight temporary secretary 
the films theme is a cliche adultery and the rejected woman 
but everyone i know was touched one way or another by it said 
balasko what happens in the film can happen to anyone and we all 
know it 
balasko said blier whose past hits include going places 
1973 and get out your handkerchiefs 1977 wrote the film 
especially for the cast 
the character played by gerard is completely passive which is 
not the way audiences are used to seeing him she said here 
hes swept along by his own emotions torn between his wife 
florence whom he describes as so perfect theres no room for 
fantasy and colette whos fat and ugly and ordinary but with whom 
he has a lot in common 
blier heightens an overriding sense of malaise by eliminating 
straightforward narrative techniques instead his characters jump 
ahead imagining what life might be like and flash back 
remembering happier times 
in one tricky scene depardieu and bouquets wedding party turns 
into a nightmarish stuffy bourgeois dinner for their narrowminded 
nouveau riche friends who cannot understand why depardieu throws 
over bouquet for the dumpy balasko 
the film is disturbing because its full of interior monologues 
performed as speeches balasko said in one scene i have to get 
up and say i know im ugly and fat these are the kinds of things 
people think to themselves but never say out loud it was extremely 
difficult 
shes not exactly ugly and fat but balasko hardly fits the 
stereotypes of stardom she has none of the sex kittenish charms of 
brigitte bardot or the chiseled features of catherine deneuve 
instead she is a small heavyset redhead who likes to wear 
tshirts baggy black pants and red eyeglasses 
in the movie she is made to look her worst dying her hair dark 
brown and sporting unflattering skirts and tight sweaters that 
emphasize her full form 
critics have praised balasko for her courage in playing 
colette and touted her as a frontrunner for best actress in next 
years cesar awards the equivalent of an american academy award at 
cannes 
balasko has 18 films to her credit including les bronzes 
the suntanned a satire on club medtype organized vacations 
and le pere noel est une ordure santa claus is rubbish in 
which she plays an uptight dogooder who gets stuck in an elevator 
on christmas eve 
balasko who has written and directed many films of her own says 
she is not a part of the french film establishment and never expects 
to be blier in fact is the first internationally known director 
to write a script with her in mind 
bliers menage was one of the hits at the 1987 film festival 
which also showcased get out your handkerchiefs 
betrand tavernier round midnight returns to the new york 
cinema fete with the poignant life and nothing but set during 
world war i american director jim jarmusch returns with mystery 
train the third in a filmic trilogy that includes stranger than 
paradise and down by law 
the festival will also show the documentary thelonius monk 
straight no chaser a portrait of the brilliant and moody jazz 
artist 
dw griffiths epic 1916 masterwork intolerance will be 
shown as a retrospective as part of an eightyear restoration 
project by the museum of modern art the film has been reconstructed 
to a colortinted print with more than 30 minutes of newly 
discovered footage four separate stories set in babylon roman 
palestine reformation france and industrial america grapple with

move over chrysler oldsmobile wants a piece of the minivan 
action and its going nosetonose with all comers to get it 
yes olds dealers for the first time are selling a van although 
you wouldnt know it by driving their new vehicle the silhouette 
it feels more like a car in fact it feels distinctly like an 
oldsmobile car soft ride over the bumps smooth acceleration an 
upscale experience 
this minivan being sold under the olds chevrolet and pontiac 
nameplates has plastic rustresistant body panels glued to a steel 
frame a first in the industry in fact the oldsmobile silhouette 
along with its sister vans the chevrolet lumina apv and pontiac 
trans sport are the worlds largest massproduced plasticskinned 
vehicles 
thats not all these general motors minivans are the first to 
feature separate rear seats that can be removed individually no 
more struggling with big heavy bench seats 
the folks at oldsmobile arent shy about saying theyre going 
after buyers of chryslers popular minivans the plymouth voyager 
and dodge caravan which started the minivan craze early this decade 
but oldsmobile also is trying to appeal to that groups upper 
crust people who appreciate a cushioned ride a wellappointed 
vehicle even optional leather seats 
they will be buyers of some means given the 19000plus price 
tag of the leather and accessoryappointed test vehicle in 
contrast chryslers basic minivans start at 11995 
buyers will be families who may not have real young children 
the children might be 10 years of age not 2 said craig 
oppenlander manager of the utility vehicles business team at 
oldsmobile buyers will be in their late30s to mid40s annual 
income will be up in the 60000s the majority will have college 
education and theyll be in professional whitecollar jobs 
theyre also folks looking for contemporary utility 
the silhouette has a rakish aerodynamic outer design with a long 
nose that takes some getting used to i kept stopping more than a 
foot short of where i wanted until i adjusted to that big snout 
the rear lighting was something new brakelights and blinker were 
up high on posts beside the rear window this hightech look was 
eyecatching especially when combined with darkly tinted rear 
windows 
inside the silhouette had plenty of room even for a burly 
passenger in the rearmost seat one sliding door on the passenger 
side offered easy entry 
the test vehicle came fitted with six bucket seats a seventh 
could be added in the middle row 
it was pretty simple to take the four rear seats out they 
weighed considerably less than the bench seats of other minivans 
and they were smaller and easier to maneuver the silhouette seats 
even had little rollers underneath to help guide the latches back 
into the floor holes during installation 
each of the four back seats had a flat vinyl back with 
indentations for holding cups a thoughtful touch for tailgaters 
i also enjoyed sitting in the rearmost seat and putting down 
just the seat backs of the middle seats and using them as ottomans 
but the silhouettes cruise control buttons protruded awkwardly 
from the turn signal stalk as ive done in other gm vehicles i 
found myself accidentally moving the lever to the on position a few 
times the cruise doesnt activate unless another button is pushed 
but its unnerving nonetheless 
and the huge windshield wipers took some getting used to they 
looked like insect claws they need to be big to cover the mammoth 
front windshield fully a third larger than that of most large 
sedans dont worry about the heat such a large windshield might 
transmit especially in a sunny climate gm puts a layer of 
metallic film in the glass to reflect heat energy and reduce the 
solar load by 30 percent 
the silhouettes 31liter v6 was teamed with a threespeed 
automatic the only transmission offered it performed well and 
responded smoothly 
oldsmobile wouldnt give sales projections noting that its 
portion of van production at the tarrytown ny assembly plant 
shared with chevrolet and pontiac will be allocated based on 
demand for all three vehicles the plants production capacity is 
more than 200000 minivans annually 
because the silhouette is new consumer reports magazine does not 
have an owner complaint report

susan saltrick her husband and 3weekold 
daughter are unlikely refugees affluent new yorkers who left 
behind japanese prints and a thousand prized books to take shelter 
in a rentfree apartment that is anything but home 
even less likely they and 350 neighbors also cast from their 
homes have hired a public relations firm to try to persuade 60 
minutes to focus on their plight 
but their misfortune is very real on aug 19 a steam pipe 
wrapped with asbestos exploded showering their neighborhood with 
potentially cancercausing fibers and rendering them homeless 
they left behind possessions collected over lifetimes they 
suffer anxiety and depression and they have no idea when or if they 
will return to their contaminated homes 
you try real hard to keep up a good face and be strong and 
tough and get through it all said saltrick who gave birth 12 
days after the blast were alive were healthy my daughter is 
fine you basically have your health and thats pretty important 
but i do get depressed worrying about where were going to be 
shoeless and pregnant saltrick clambered down a fire truck 
ladder when the underground steam pipe blew up in front of her 
building at 32 gramercy park south on the east side of manhattan 
one of her neighbors the mother of a 5monthold boy was killed 
when steam and debris wrecked her apartment as she napped also 
killed were two workers for consolidated edison the electric 
utility that owns the steam pipes 
a geyser of mud 12 stories high roared like a rocket for four 
hours some residents later sought psychological help for nerves 
frazzled by the deafening noise 
only later did people learn the mud was full of asbestos 
saltrick and her husband john meyer spent the night at a 
friends house the next day they found their apartment untouched by 
the blast and moved back saltrick and others turned on air 
conditioners and vacuumed the dirt they tracked in unwittingly 
that may have spread asbestos into units that might otherwise have 
remained uncontaminated 
con ed had tested for asbestos but said nothing about possible 
contamination in the neighborhood building managers discovered the 
asbestos three days later through tests of their own lawyers for 
the buildings as well as city officials have accused con ed of a 
coverup the utility has been cited six times since 1988 by the 
occupational safety and health administration for allegedly failing 
to test accurately for asbestos in other cases 
on aug 23 saltrick meyer and neighbors were given three hours 
notice to leave their homes for what they thought would be a few 
days 
days turned into weeks con ed spokeswoman pat richardi now says 
the buildings should be cleaned up by thanksgiving but victims say 
con ed is again denying reality 
saltrick and meyer with the baby on the way were counting on 
selling their onebedroom cooperative apartment to finance purchase 
of a bigger unit the man whod agreed to buy saltricks coop 
before the blast has since had mortgage applications rejected by two 
banks 
con ed is paying about 500000 a week for the 350 displaced 
residents to stay in hotels eat out every night and replace 
essential items including computers for some who had worked at 
home 
saltrick says con ed offered her only 200 to replace all the 
baby furniture she left in her apartment nine months pregnant she 
stood up at a public meeting to complain the utility agreed to pay 
for whatever she needed 
but saltrick didnt want to bring newborn sarah back to a hotel 
one hour before she went into labor she found a onebedroom 
apartment through a company that houses executives on shortterm 
transfers con ed pays the 2000 monthly rent 
everyday saltrick contacts con ed and her building managers for 
the latest on the cleanup then she spends hours shopping for the 
basics her new apartment lacks spices a garbage can toiletries 
sarah will never get to use the babyshower gifts still sitting in 
her old apartment with the toys and crib she and meyer bought months 
ago 
their 15000 homeowners insurance policy wont begin to cover 
the rugs clothes upholstery and other porous items that will have 
to be discarded because they absorbed asbestos fibers richardi says 
con ed expects plenty of hefty claims and lawsuits once the cleanup 
is complete 
until 1975 con ed wrapped its steam pipes in asbestos to reduce 
heat loss other insulating materials have been used since 
scientists determined longterm exposure to the fiber causes cancer 
but no level of exposure to asbestos is considered safe 
doctors are telling these people come back every six months 
for the rest of your life and ill let you know if youve been 
affected said david jaroslawicz a lawyer who filed a 30 
million lawsuit against con ed on behalf of the building at 151 e 
20th st which was evacuated the same night as saltricks building 
the cleanup is an enormous undertaking entire buildings have 
been swathed in plastic environmental officials hired a special 
company to decontaminate art objects antiques and computers 
contractors have even scrubbed down trees 
dan sitomer a lawyer retained by saltricks building says the 
victims of gramercy park are to be no less pitied because they have 
the resources to demand and get the help they need 
theres no class system when a disaster strikes he said 
there are only people who have been touched and hurt 
sheldon adler president of saltricks coop board is confident 
that saltrick and other victims will ultimately force con ed to make 
appropriate restitution 
we had the terrible misfortune of having our building 
damaged he said but con ed had the misfortune of running up 
against people who know what theyre doing

the metropolitan opera opens its new season 
monday with an allstar cast singing aida but the most 
anticipated performance will come a few days later with the debut of 
an exciting young american tenor richard leech singing rodolfo in 
la boheme 
mondays aida stars aprile millo and placido domingo on the 
second night teresa stratas returns to the met after eight years 
leech will sing saturday 
leech 32 walks like an athlete with a brisk spring in his step 
and thats part of his appeal 
i try to allow the fact that im young and can move around to 
creep into the action on stage when its appropriate said leech 
who did some diving and played football in high school 
in the elixir of love at the tricities opera in binghamton 
ny he slid 15 feet from a roof to the stage about 15 feet to the 
ground an unusual staging for the opera 
leech who grew up in binghamton and started as a teenager in 
the operas chorus is confident on stage since hes been performing 
so long 
the first three la boheme productions in which he performed 
were in binghamton he was in the chorus then the small part of the 
toy vendor 
by the time i got around to singing rodolfo la boheme was an 
old friend he said 
growing up on stage is how i look at myself when youre on 
stage its no big deal thats how it needs to be then you have 
the presence of mind to deal with it when you go on in your debut in 
vienna in rigoletto with no rehearsal 
thats a standard in some european houses that the met has 
managed to avoid the attitude that in the standard repertoire 
everybody knows how it goes thats no way to get great 
performances i did lucia di lammermoor in berlin the same way 
la boheme is a particular favorite for leech he made his new 
york city opera debut in the opera in 1984 and his lyric opera of 
chicago debut in it in 1987 hell sing in the first eight 
performances at the met this season 
hell make his la scala debut next may as pinkerton in madama 
butterfly which he performed as his debut in florence italy and 
washington 
thats another of my favorites i dont have much to sing in 
the second act but the first act love duet makes the whole opera 
worthwhile to me he said 
a recent feather in his cap was singing in the verdi requiem 
at the opening of the new morton h meyerson symphony center in 
dallas in early september 
as debuts at the met and other major opera houses approach leech 
is not too overly excited 
i find that i tend not to he said im excited because 
its the proper progression of things and its nice to have 
happening it is very much fun but excited in the sense of nervous 
or too much anticipation i dont do placing too much importance on 
that one night you set yourself up to fail that night 
leech looks at a debut as just another performance 
the tenor was born in north hollywood calif the middle one of 
three children when leech was 8 his father took a job with ibm in 
binghamton his school took classes to the opera and leech saw his 
first romeo and juliet in seventh grade i fell in love with 
juliet 
when he was 15 his choir teacher said he should take voice 
lessons since we had this opera company we went there and i 
began studying with carmen savoca and peyton hibbitt the two men 
who founded the tricities opera theyre rare and incredible 
teachers i just fell into the luck of being in the right place at 
the right time he decided at 17 to stay in opera 
and he stayed in binghamton he went to the eastman school of 
music for a semester decided he preferred the training at home and 
returned to savoca and hibbitt in 1980 he entered the caruso 
competition for tenors under 25 in milan italy and tied for first 
place with william matiuzzi part of the prize was studying two 
years at la scala leech declined and went back to binghamton leech 
went on to be hired by regional operas pittsburgh cincinnati 
baltimore san diego washington his european debut much 
commended was in 1987 in berlin as raoul in a new production of 
les huguenots 
so he had some international acclaim before coming to the met 
im relatively outspoken when it comes to talking about what i 
will and will not do from day 1 of talks with the met they were 
aware i wasnt going to come in and work my way up from the bottom 
of the ladder again he said 
leechs wife laurie is assistant stage director of the 
tricities opera she supports me very well in what must be a very 
difficult thing to do he said i wouldnt want to be a tenors 
wife 
as much as a tenor tries not to be neurotic i think he tends to 
be you always worry about your health inevitably when it comes 
down to being nervous about health or performances i think opera 
singers will take it out on those around them i try not to do that 
but i have a feeling i occasionally do laurie is masterful at being 
able to balance when to give me room and the support i need 
her ability to understand singers psyches also makes her a 
good stage director 
leech is amazed by the mets schedule for the season 
i cannot imagine trying to get on the number of performances 
they have here he said im glad thats not my job my job is 
simple compared to that i just sing

campeau corp rescued from a cash shortage with 
a 250 million emergency loan may have to dismantle its 
coasttocoast retail empire to permanently resolve its debt 
troubles 
for the time being the canadian holding company may continue to 
have a credibility problem with major suppliers to its department 
stores possibly making it difficult for them to stock up adequately 
for peak christmas demand 
despite announcement tuesday that campeau had reached a 
definitive loan agreement with olympia amp york developments ltd 
analysts said the financial ailments at campeaus allied stores 
corp and federated department stores inc divisions arent 
automatically cured 
it will be a precarious situation with the federated and allied 
stores through christmas said herbert wittkin a new york retail 
consultant 
meanwhile heller financial inc a company that acts as a 
middleman for retailers and vendors said it was continuing to 
monitor campeaus condition 
last week heller advised its clients that if they shipped goods 
to campeauowned retailers they would have to do so at their own 
risk heller said it temporarily wouldnt accept the risk due to 
campeaus uncertain situation 
john brooklier a heller spokesman said campeaus announcement 
tuesday didnt immediately alter hellers position 
heller based in chicago and owned by japans fuji bank ltd is 
one of the biggest factoring firms in the retail business factoring 
companies buy retail receivables from apparel makers and often act 
as their credit managers thereby exerting considerable influence in 
the way vendors do business 
the loan pact gives olympia amp york more clout in the management 
of campeau and reduces the financial stake of robert campeau the 
companys founder who remains chairman and chief executive officer 
olympia amp york an investment holding and realestate development 
company closely held by torontos wealthy reichmann family gained 
three seats on a new 10member campeau board and got the right to 
buy almost 16 million shares of campeau stock 
olympia amp york also was given authority to help steer campeau 
through a major financial overhaul which wall street analysts 
expect could bring change in campeaus retail operation the 
previously announced sale of the bloomingdales chain could be 
followed by more sales of selective holdings 
there is such a lot of debt theyre going to have to get the 
money from somewhere said pamela stubing an analyst at moodys 
investors service inc 
i would assume that there would be assets on the block i 
would think they wouldnt try to dump a lot of them on the block 
because that would depress the market 
campeau spokeswoman carol sanger said possible asset sales would 
be among many options considered by a newly formed restructuring 
commmittee for now campeau is seeking buyers for bloomingdales 
only she said 
numerous potential bidders are believed interested in new 
yorkbased bloomingdales 
bloomingdales chairman and chief executive officer marvin s 
traub has said he would try to lead a management buyout of the 
17store chain he has run since 1978 crown american corp a 
privatelyheld firm that is a major us shopping mall developer 
also said it may go after bloomingdales 
under the definitive agreement with olympia amp york a new board 
of directors was appointed three members of the new board come from 
the campeau group three from olympia amp york and four represent 
minority shareholders 
the board formed a restructuring committee headed by one of the 
three reichmannappointed members of the board lionel dodd the 
companys us arm will select a chief executive officer and chief 
financial officer who will report directly to the board and 
restructuring committee 
the executives main mission will be to supervise the 
restructuring of campeaus us retail operations which also 
include the jordan marsh sterns ralphs lazarus burdines and 
richsgoldsmiths chains 
the first portion of the loan from olympia amp york became 
available immediately the agreement calls for up to 150 million to 
be channeled to federated and the remainder to allied which are 
both based in cincinnati 
with these loans federated and allied anticipate being able to 
continue to meet all of their obligations to suppliers and creditors 
in a timely manner the company said in an announcement issued by 
its toronto headquarters 
in return for providing the cash olympia amp york will receive 
warrants entitling it to purchase up to 15625 million ordinary 
campeau shares at 16 each until sept 18 1991 
the share purchase would raise olympia amp yorks current 245 
percent stake in campeau to about 384 percent on a fully diluted 
basis meanwhile robert campeaus stake will drop to 432 percent 
from about 54 percent under the agreement

more than half the participants in a survey of 
22000 manufacturing company employees said they see a need to 
improve the climate in which they work a consulting firm said 
rath amp strong which conducted the survey and released it 
tuesday said the most oftencited desires were for better feedback 
on performance more training and career development and better 
ways of resolving conflicts 
more and more employees are getting more and more restless 
dan ciampa president of rath amp strong said in an interview 
fiftyfour percent rated their supervisors as effective managers 
and 67 percent of all hourly employees said their jobs are not 
reviewed enough to keep employees as productive as possible 
this information suggests that production employees care as 
much perhaps even more than managers about quality but are 
frustrated by their companys slowness to respond john burns a 
vice president of the lexington massbased consulting firm said 
in a news release 
the survey covered 22600 employees of fortune 500 manufacturing 
companies about 46 percent were hourly workers and 54 percent

the national retail market since january 1988 the panel said 
consumers may keep the bear or return it for a refund from the

daiichi kangyo banks planned investment in 
manufacturers hanover corp is the latest effort by cashrich 
japanese banks to gain firmer footing in the united states 
particularly in the financing of midsized breadandbutter 
companies experts said 
you can say that their interests are in two areas learning the 
tricks of the trade here and in diversifying to increase 
earnings masaru kakutani an associate director of the investment 
research firm moodys investors service inc said tuesday 
in recent years japanese banks have made significant inroads in 
the us market by adding and expanding their own branch offices 
here or buying into established financial units from banking to 
securities operations 
in california for example japaneseowned banks reportedly 
account for nearly 20 percent of the banking business and in new 
york eight of the 10 largest foreign bank branches are part of 
japanese banks 
japanese institutions make about 5 percent of all us loans and 
hold about 9 percent of us banking assets according to kakutanis 
estimates he and some other experts predict those figures will 
climb steadily in the next 18 months as japanese banks try to 
maintain a competitive edge with each other but daiichi the 
worlds largest bank with assets of 414 billion made the biggest 
commitment in us banking thus far when it agreed to acquire a 49 
percent stake in manufacturers hanover and a 60 percent interest in 
cit group the banks financial services unit for about 14 
billion 
the deal announced by both banks monday and subject to 
regulatory approval was part of a sweeping recapitalization plan by 
cashhungry manufacturers hanover the seventhlargest us bank 
with 70 billion in assets that plan includes a 950 million 
addition to loanloss reserves to cover shaky third world debt and 
the issuance of as much as 500 million in new common stock by 
years end 
because manufacturers will retain a minority stake in cit and 
current management will remain intact under the deal daiichi will 
be receiving the american knowhow it needs for expansion while 
saving money in the long run some analysts said 
leasing and lending to mediumsized us companies which is 
cits primary business are areas japanese companies have been eager 
to enter because they are among the most profitable parts of the 
us financial market 
profits are larger in the middle market because such companies 
have less access to the stock and bond markets than the larger 
corporations and therefore less say in negotiating loan terms 
said richard a mueller an analyst with duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago 
at the same time james j mcdermott jr of keefe bruyette amp 
woods in new york said startup efforts in those areas are costly 
and time consuming 
and yuko oana daiichis senior managing director conceded 
we lack the technology and local expertise 
he said cit will enable us to offer a considerably broader 
product line to our customers around the world and at the same 
time we believe that cit will benefit from the international 
exposure and prespective that dkb can provide 
other japanese banks have made similar deals 
as the daiichimanufacturers hanover announcement was being made 
monday daiwa bank ltd said it agreed to acquire the us 
commercial banking operations of britains lloyds bank plc for about 
200 million earlier this summer mitsui bank ltd agreed to pay 
100 million for a 5 percent stake in a security pacific corp 
finance unit that includes leasing commercial and consumer finance 
in 1984 fuji bank paid 425 million for control of heller 
international corp a commercial finance company like cit 
even japanese companies outside of banking have gotten into the 
act in august orix corp a major japanese leasing company agreed 
to pay 190 million for a capital equipment financing subsidiary 
owned by first interstate bancorp 
in addition a number of big japanese banks control primary 
dealers in us government securities 
us financial institutions on the other hand have been slower 
to expand in japan primarily because access to japanese markets 
hasnt been as open as access for japanese firms to us markets

transportation secretary samuel skinner says he 
would revoke an airlines certificate to fly if debt incurred by a 
buyout or other transaction threatened its fitness 
skinner also told an international aviation industry group 
tuesday that he was keeping close watch on investments by foreign 
carriers in us airlines 
the transportation department is expected to complete within a 
few days an assessment of the takeover of nwa inc parent company 
of northwest airlines by california investor alfred checchi in a 
deal that leaves the carrier with 31 billion in debt 
the department also has begun examining the planned 675 billion 
buyout of united airlines parent company by a group including its 
pilots and current management 
i will not allow excessive debt in the airline industry to 
jeopardize the public interest especially in the important area of 
safety skinner said in a speech that did not refer directly to 
the northwest or united takeovers 
he said that if an airlines fitness is called into question 
rest assured that the department will not hesitate to make 
adjustments to the airlines operating certificate 
or if absolutely necessary and i hope that doesnt take 
place we will revoke the certificate he said 
on foreign investment in us airlines skinner said as long 
as i am secretary you can rest assured that i will keep an eagle 
eye on these transactions the interests of the american public 
cannot and will not be sacrificed 
royal dutch airlines has a share in the northwest deal and 
british airways plc would hold a minority interest in ual parent 
company of united in that buyout other foreign airlines recently 
have acquired minority shares of us airlines 
under law foreign investment in a us airline is limited to a 
25 percent stake 
they are not cookies they are not hairspray they are a 
valuable natural resource skinner said of us airlines 
he expressed support for increased international trade and 
investment but said foreign investment in us airlines raises 
national security questions and poses problems in negotiating for 
air routes 
in some circumstances i think we would have to reconsider our 
practice of sharing our negotiating position on foreign routes 
with the us airlines he said indicating that the information 
might be made available to the airlines foreign partners

sixty us companies have taken extraordinary 
steps to accommodate working mothers with benefits and other 
inducements that range from child care centers to generous parental 
leave working mother magazine reports 
its survey on the best companies for working mothers 
published in the october issue on sale today includes corporate 
giants such as international business machines corp dupont and 
merck amp co inc as well as smaller concerns such as regional banks 
and hospitals 
the pity is there arent more companies its too bad its not 
the 600 best companies judsen culbreth editor of the magazine 
said tuesday but we do want to credit these companies as being 
forwardthinking 
the working mother is the fastestgrowing category of the labor 
force more than half of all women with children younger than 6 
years old work outside the home vs 12 percent in 1950 the labor 
department says 
by the year 2000 the department estimates 84 percent of all 
women of childbearing age will be working nonetheless less than 1 
percent of all us companies provide child care aid to their 
employees 
culbreth said the 60 companies on the list recognize theres a 
labor shortage and they see family benefit packages as a real 
recruiting tool 
working mother deputy editor susan seliger said the list was 
based on questionnaires mailed to hundreds of american businesses 
as well as followup interviews with managers and employees she 
said the company did not attempt to rank the finalists from best to 
worst due to the difficulty of doing so 
its not like the fortune 500 which is cut and dried she 
said this is something subtler more difficult to quantify 
the magazine said the finalists were chosen based on salary 
advancement opportunity support for child care and a benefits 
package that included maternity leave parental leave adoption aid 
flexible schedules parttime work job sharing and support for care 
of elderly dependents 
it said the top 10 companies were selected based on their 
superior showing in these categories 
among the top 10 for example is apple computer inc which 
provides one of the most competitive pay and benefit packages of any 
us company it offers a child care center at its cupertino 
calif headquarters that is open until 7 pm apple also bestows 
500 on all new babies of its employees and provides up to 3000 in 
adoption aid 
at armonk nybased ibm where 20 percent of managers are 
women mothers get three years of unpaid leave with benefits and 
employees have a twohour window within which to arrive and leave 
work 
merck the worlds largest producer of prescription drugs is 
breaking ground for a new childcare center at its rahway nj 
headquarters provides parttime hours for new mothers returning to 
work and allows employees to work at home 
other entries include cary ncbased sas institute a computer 
software maker where nearly half the managers are women and the 
company provies a free onsite child care center and beth israel 
hospital in boston where nurses can earn up to 63000 a year and 
nursing mothers can use breastpump stations so they dont have to 
abandon breast feeding when they return to work 
other members of the top 10 included dupont of wilmington del 
felpro inc of skokie ill hoffmanla roche inc of nutley nj 
morrison amp foerster of san francisco and syntex corp of palo alto 
calif 
working mother a 10yearold magazine headquartered in new york

federal and state regulators say that 
commercial banks despite record postdepression failures are not 
falling into a crisis similar to that experienced by the savings and 
loan industry 
but they told a house banking financial institutions subcommittee 
tuesday they are keeping a wary eye on potential trouble spots 
including third world debts leveraged buyout loans junk bonds 
failures and real estate losses 
the bank insurance fund is solvent and can meet the obligations 
as we foresee them today l william seidman chairman of the 
federal deposit insurance corp testified 
subcommittee chairman frank annunzio dill scheduled three 
days of hearings on the state of the bank and credit union insurance 
systems in light of the failure of the savings and loan insurance 
fund and the subsequent congressional authorization of 50 billion 
to bail out the industry 
at tuesdays opening session annunzio claimed there are 
similarities between the two financial sectors 
while thrifts were making bad loans in the united states banks 
were making bad loans all over the world he said while thrifts 
made adc acquisition development and construction loans banks 
made lbo leveraged buyout loans 
annunzio pointed to other problems 
in 1988 the fdic which insures individual deposits against 
losses up to 100000 each had a net loss of 42 billion its 
first loss in its 50year history 
two hundred banks failed in 1988 
another 1000 banks are rated as problem institutions 
some observers of the banking industry have suggested that 
commercial banks will soon face a crisis similar to that experienced 
by the savings and loan industry comptroller of the currency 
robert l clarke testified 
in my view such concerns are overstated and are inconsistent 
with observable trends in bank performance he said 
seidman also noted the bank failures and the cost of assisting 
troubled banks but said we believe that the worst of the problems 
in the banking industry are behind us 
we expect this years failure rate to be similar to or slightly 
better than last year and we project the pace of bank failures to 
slow next year he said 
federal reserve vice chairman manuel h johnson noting the large 
number and the size of the failed banks told the subcommittee the 
recent problems have demonstrated the strength of the bank insurance 
fund but he added 
in our view for the system to remain sound it must be 
governed by an adequate supervisory framework that strikes the 
proper balance between reasonable prudential rules such as minimum 
capital standards and an adequate onsite supervision and 
examination program 
jill m considine chairman of the conference of state bank 
supervisors also noted the debate over capital standards and said 
they should not be lowered just because thrifts entering the bank 
insurance sytstem cannot meet a specified standard 
she also called for a separation of bank chartering and insurance 
functions saying the essential conflict between the proactive 
perfomanceoriented goals of the charterer and the riskadverse 
attitude of the insurer demands balance 
we saw this breakdown in the federal home loan bank board 
which until the new savings and loan law was enacted both chartered 
and insured thrifts she said

a divided senate voted to boost the price 
ceiling on home mortgages the federal housing administration can 
insure heading off a democratic effort to eliminate the cap 
entirely 
adoption of the measure tuesday increasing the current 101250 
limit to 124875 was a reversal by the lawmakers minutes earlier 
they narrowly rejected a similar provision that would have raised 
the ceiling to just 118000 
democrats with a sprinkling of republican support had sought to 
eliminate the price ceiling on mortgages arguing that the move 
would benefit borrowers living in the nations priciest housing 
markets 
but sensing a campaign issue republicans said the democratic 
proposal would mostly benefit welltodo people and divert fha 
resources away from poorer home buyers 
this is a classic case where my colleagues on the other side 
talk about the poor and the underclass and lowincome and medium 
income and are reaching out again to help the rich said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan 
the provision is part of a 672 billion measure financing 
federal housing veterans space and environmental programs for 
fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 
by a 5543 vote the senate rejected a democratic attempt to 
scuttle the proposed 124875 ceiling the cap which will last for 
one year was then adopted on a voice vote 
i think people were knowledgeable that i was going to keep 
working at it said sen don nickles rokla who sponsored both 
the 118000 and 125000 cap proposals and had threatened to keep 
introducing amendments until one was adopted 
sen alan cranston dcalif who fought for removing the cap 
entirely said afterward that his side was caught by surprise by 
nickles repeated efforts 
that vote came after the chamber rejected 5049 to reject the 
proposal to raise the limit to 118000 
thirtynine republicans and 16 democrats voted against blocking 
the 124875 ceiling proposal only 36 republicans and 13 democrats 
had supported the lower cap on the earlier vote 
aides to nickles estimated the 125000 ceiling might stimulate 
about 5 billion worth of additional home purchases they said 
metropolitan areas where borrowers would be able to take advantage 
of the higher cap include boston new york city stamford conn 
washington dc los angeles san francisco and san diego 
the bush administration had opposed removing the fha mortgage 
cap arguing it would be unwise to do so without reforming the 
fiscally troubled agency 
opponents of eliminating the cap entirely said that would expose 
the government to huge losses from additional loan defaults the 
fhas main insurance fund lost 452 million last year according to 
a congressional report as default payments outweighed collected 
fees 
congress was told last month by comptroller general charles 
bowsher that fha has very serious financial management 
difficulties 
opponents also argued that removing the ceiling would in effect 
shift more of the fhas resources from lowincome to highincome 
people and would be most beneficial to buyers in wealthy areas such 
as new york and california 
if they ever want a fatcat provision this is it said sen 
jesse helms rnc 
supporters of scrapping the 101250 ceiling argued that it would 
make more fha loans available in many of the countrys most 
expensive areas in 18 states plus washington dc the median home 
price already exceeds that limit according to the national 
association of home builders 
more than 17 million families have used fha insurance since the 
agency was founded in 1934 
under the program borrowers obtain their loans from banks and 
the loans in turn are guaranteed by the government because the bank 
is making a riskfree investment it is able to offer better terms 
to borrowers 
the house version of the bill passed july 20 did not contain 
the fha provision

a former executive of amc inc was 
indicted tuesday on charges of stealing more than 2 million from 
the kansas citybased motion picture theater company 
george b jones 42 of olathe kan was charged in a 21count 
indictment returned by a federal grand jury said frank j storey 
agent in charge of the kansas city fbi office 
storey said jones amcs former vice president of accounting is 
charged with 12 counts of interstate transportation of stolen money 
four counts of money laundering and five counts of income tax 
evasion 
storey said the indictment resulted from a 10month investigation 
by the fbi and the internal revenue service begun after amc 
officials discovered irregularities in vendor payments allegedly 
arranged by jones 
jones declined to comment tuesday his attorney james wyrsch 
said at this point until we have an opportunity to evaluate the 
evidence we dont have any comment at some point we intend to make 
our side of it known 
the indictment said jones asked amc to issue checks to designs 
unlimited described as a fictitious business he established and 
represented as a project he was administering for the chairman of 
the board 
according to the indictment jones deposited the checks into the 
account of dl jones construction co doing business as designs 
unlimited at a bank where he had established lines of credit in 
both names 
jones allegedly took cash advances from the lines of credit and 
repaid them by depositing embezzled amc checks resulting in a loss 
of 23 million to the company 
the indictment also charged that jones filed false income tax 
returns by understating his income for 1983 through 1987 and that 
he engaged in money laundering by depositing embezzled funds into 
the bank 
conviction on all counts could mean a sentence of up to 185 years 
and fines of up to 45 million

well as on radio and in print the total cost of the marketing 
program is 25 million through the end of 1990 
the campaign replaces ads that for the past three years have

steve jobs pitching next incs pricey 
workstation to the business world recalled the first time he saw a 
computer spreadsheet 
it was 1977 and one of the creators of the spreadsheet was 
showing it off at apple computer inc the cupertino company 
cofounded by jobs 
somebody was ushering him through saying its the most 
incredible thing weve seen in software jobs remembered we 
hardly knew how to spell software back then it was this visual 
calculator and they were trying to decide what to call it 
the name chosen was visicalc and the product turned the apple 
ii coinvented by jobs into a practical business computer and a 
huge success 
that was the first education we got as to how important these 
things were going to become in our lives jobs said any of us 
who went through that experience never forgot how much a spreadsheet 
shapes the future of the computer we saw the same thing with 
macintosh 
jobs who left apple after a dispute believes his new company 
next inc will have even greater success cracking the business 
market after the introduction tuesday of the versatile wingz graphic 
spreadsheet from informix software inc and completion of nexts 10 
operating system 
next recently began shipping its sleek black 9995 workstation 
and demand is picking up rapidly said david a norman chief 
executive officer for businessland nexts us distributor norman 
said he is sticking by his estimate that next will account for 100 
million in sales within 12 months 
we have sold hundreds of next machines into the corporate 
marketplace and we need to sell thousands said norman what we 
needed was one an operating system and two real applications 
today marks the beginning of real applications 
jobs said nexts heavily automated plant in fremont is ready to 
speed up quickly for highvolume shipments to match normans sales 
expectations 
it has a large enough capacity to support a 1 billion 
company jobs said we have ambitious goals i think weve 
passed some real significant milestones but i think we have a lot 
of work left to do 
jobs said that when apple developed the macintosh under his 
direction we kind of went into corporate america through the back 
door we werent really accepted in the front door 
the next machine though was designed to meet the needs of 
businesses that want to develop their own software quickly and 
efficiently and use it on an easily operated and reliable 
workstation 
next is coming in the front door now norman said were 
getting the heads of management information systems to see this 
product and take the factory tour its a lot easier for us to get 
the products evaluated and get on the approved lists so people can 
buy the products 
part of jobs ambitious plans are tied to a software development 
relationship with international business machines corp a company 
he once disparaged in ads as big brother 
ibms interest in next stems from the usefulness of nextstep in 
speeding software development and the desire by ibm to get software 
for its workstations into the marketplace quickly 
the two companies struck a deal giving ibm the right to evaluate 
nextstep and establish royalty rates and contingency payments if ibm 
decides to offer it 
nextstep which programmers say allows up to 33 percent faster 
development of software was used by informix to create its wingz 
version for next nextstep is a layer of software that sits between 
the operating system which controls the inside of the computer and 
the application programs such as word processors and spreadsheets 
if the nextibm relationship proves successful it could mean big 
trouble for software leader and longstanding ibm partner microsoft 
corp and workstation manufacturers sun microsystems inc digital 
equipment corp and hewlettpackard corp 
jobs wooing of ibm is just the opening skirmish in what has 
become a sordid battle for intellectual leadership of the 
industry says stewart alsop editor of pc letter 
jobs is working with more than 70 software companies including 
lotus development corp encouraging them to do to microsoft with 
the next computer what microsoft did to them with the macintosh 
microsoft gained its preeminence in the industry by developing 
software for ibm and then capturing nearly the entire business 
application market for the macintosh 
jobs who seeded next with 7 million of his own money in 1985 
after he left apple owns 50 percent of the company which has a 
total valuation of 600 million 
canon inc of japan which invested 100 million in next earlier 
this year owns 1667 percent of the company and the perot group 
headed by investor ross perot owns 1251 percent next employees 
own 20 percent

resorts international inc wants its 
bondholders to accept a bond exchange plan aimed at cutting its 
extensive debt 
the hotelcasino company owned by entertainer merv griffin also 
indicated in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
that it was considering the possible sale of several atlantic city 
properties including land leased to the showboat hotel and casino 
under the exchange plan announced to bondholders tuesday resorts 
bondholders would trade in their existing bonds for new debentures 
cash totaling about 54 million and common stock amounting to 25 
percent of resorts outstanding shares 
resorts operations this year are not likely to generate enough 
money to cover its debt payments griffin took on 900 million in 
debt when he purchased the casino company from developer donald 
trump last november 
to help ease its cash crunch resorts would have the option of 
not paying interest on the bonds given to its junior bondholders for 
five years while for three years it would have the option of paying 
interest to senior bondholders in the form of additional notes 
the investment firm salomon brothers inc of new york presented 
the refinancing plan at a bondholders meeting that griffin did not 
attend 
resorts bondholders must approve the reorganization plan but no 
voting date has been scheduled ninety percent of each class of 
bonds must approve for the plan for it to take effect 
resorts officials said bondholders might organize and select 
representatives to discuss the plan with the company 
we believe it makes more sense to work with us than to 
throw up your hands and make it collapse resorts president david 
p hanlon said 
salomon believes that resorts is a healthy company is 
profitable and is making money said jay f higgins a vice 
president of salomon brothers but we believe an unhappy marriage 
exists between the operations of the company and the liability 
structure and it needs to be changed 
some bondholders already have filed a class action suit against 
resorts charging that the companys top officers inflated the worth 
of the company in a prospectus issued by drexel burnham lambert 
inc last year the prospectus offered 325 million of notes on top 
of more than 600 million of resorts existing notes 
resorts faces payments of more than 1335 million in interest 
and principal this year its operations in the first half of 1989 
generated just under 16 million in cash flow 
resorts problems stem partly from competition from newer casinos 
that have sprung up in atlantic city poor management and 
deteriorating physical facilities said hanlon 
the company also poured money into its massive taj majal casino 
project which remained unfinished when trump took control of 
resorts trump retained the taj majal when he sold the company to 
griffin 
in its sec filing resorts indicated that required renovations 
and improvements at its atlantic city hotel and casino operations 
were more extensive than management originally estimated and could 
take 50 million more than normal and recurring expenses 
properties that resorts is considering selling include the land 
leased to the showboat which is part of a 27acre tract plus 
various other undeveloped sites in atlantic city

today it agreed to sell its chemicals group to frances 
rhonepoulenc sa for about 892 million 
under terms of the deal rhonepoulenc will pay rtz 804 million 
in cash and assume debt totaling 88 million 
the rtz chemical businesses had an aftertax profit of 37 
million with net assets of 364 million at the end of last year 
the announced sale puts rtz closer to its goal of strengthening 
its interest in base and precious metals mining while selling off 
parts of its largely natural resourcesbased group 
rtc disposed of two major oilproduction assets last year and 
earlier this year purchased the minerals and mining businesses of 
british petroleum co plc 
rtz is now even more clearly focused on its lowcost mining 
portfolio and its leading related industrial manufacturing 
businesses chief executive derek birkin said in a statement today 
the acquisition will boost statecontrolled rhonepoulencs 
presence in the highmargin area of specialty chemicals and 
complement its previous us expansion moves including the purchase

the publishers of comptons encyclopedia are 
launching a computerized talking version that has everything 
from snatches of mozart to richard nixon saying im not a crook 
the talking encyclopedia scheduled to be announced today is 
intended for schools teaching students in the fourth through eighth 
grades although comptons says other students could learn from it 
as well 
comptons not sparing the hyperbole said there has not been 
such a significant development in publishing since gutenberg 
originated the method of printing from movable type 
comptons multimedia encyclopedia comes on a compact disc that 
works in conjunction with a special kind of cd player and a personal 
computer the student can search through the disc by typing on a 
computer keyboard or clicking a handheld device called a mouse 
besides sounds the talking encyclopedia has animated pictures 
such as a moving skeleton 15000 still pictures maps and charts 
the full text of the 26volume standard comptons encyclopedia and 
the 65000entry merriamwebster intermediate dictionary 
a student who types in a single word say castle will be 
given references to all kinds of related topics including 
construction techniques and the history of the middle ages 
comptons a unit of encyclopedia britannica inc appears to be 
in the lead in the field of talking encyclopedias grolier inc has 
had the text of its academic american encyclopedia on disc since 
1985 but it does not have any pictures or sound 
encyclopedia britannica itself also is available on compact disc 
although in text only 
the talking encyclopedia appears wellsuited to the the 
channelflipping tv generation since it encourages casual browsing 
students who look up bees can click on one symbol to see a 
picture of bees and another symbol to hear them buzzing 
the sound is no gimmick but rather an important component of 
the multimedia approach that makes learning compelling and more 
rewarding stanley frank president of britannica software said 
in a statement 
students can zoom in on things that interest them for example 
they can zero in from a picture of the globe to a continent to a 
particular portion of one country in seven stages the same goes for 
a timeline of us history and a color anatomy of the human body 
the compact disc requires an ibmcompatible personal computer 
with a color screen a speaker and a compact disc readonly memory 
cdrom player which together cost about 3000 the disc itself 
costs 895 compared to 695 for the regular encyclopedia 
britannica software said compatible cdrom players are available 
now from sony corp hitachi ltd and amdek 
a single disc can serve a network of 1520 computers compton 
says 
a few bugs remain to be worked out the animated sequences are 
not yet ready and a brief look through the disc tuesday turned up a 
typographical error although the publishers say a student can type 
in a question and be directed to an answer the program tends to get 
hung up by even simple questions 
about 250 schools have bought the unfinished version for the fall 
semester and it will officially go on sale jan 1 1990 
the talking encyclopedia isnt suited to long stretches of 
reading but comptons hopes it will stimulate students to go off in 
a corner and read the regular volumes 
the talking version isnt just for students who lack 
concentration said norman j bastin executive director of planning 
and development for encyclopedia britannica he said he has a 
14yearold daughter who loves it 
she plays with the atlas for three or four hours at a time 
nationwide sales of compact disc information products totaled 
about 125 million last year and are growing almost 20 percent a 
year estimates link resources corp a new yorkbased consulting 
firm

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade partly 
in reaction to forecasts for frost in the corn belt early next week 
the early rally followed two days of sharply lower prices 
at least one major private forecasting firm was calling for frost 
late monday as far south as northern illinois northern indiana and 
parts of ohio 
but meteorologists were divided on the chances for frost and 
analysts said freezing temperatures at this late stage of the growth 
cycle would pose little threat to the crops 
in realty it wont do anything but speed up the leafdrop 
stage of the soybeans in illinois and indiana but it would hurt 
the ohio beans said william biedermann director of research with 
allendale inc a futures brokerage in crystal lake ill 
he said the markets also were supported by extremely light farmer 
sales of grain a function of the recent drop in prices 
in early trading wheat futures were cent to 1 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 381 a bushel corn 
was cent to 1 cent higher with september at 234 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to 1 cent higher with september at 133 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with september at

union president sigurd lucassen told reporters he said the loans 
were approved by his predecessor patrick campbell and that he 
would no longer involve the union in risky direct real estate loans 
he said any losses would not affect union operations or services 
the money is from general treasury reserves and does not involve 
pension assets 
the union has filed suit in district of columbia superior court 
against empire contracting consulting a new yorkbased firm that 
also serviced and monitored the loans 
lucassen said empire and its top two officials paul w adler and 
stanley j burns repeatedly assured union officials the loans and 
projects were in great shape but that all now had either been 
foreclosed or are near foreclosure 
the suit filed alleges the officials failed to properly analyze 
the loan proposals failed to monitor the performance of the 
developers and misled the union 
empire attorney ira lee sorkin denied the allegations and said 
the company was being drawn into an internal dispute between 
lucassen and campbell 
empire worked to the best of its ability to represent the best 
interests of the union sorkin said 
the most expensive project is a baltimore waterfront condominium 
development that is partially completed and occupied and now being 
run by the union the union took it over from the developer who has 
filed for bankruptcy the project hendersons wharf got a 346 
million loan from the union according to its attorney 
the other troubled projects are 
clermont condominiums in nyack ny developed with an 181 
million union loan 
reddie point a land development in jacksonville fla financed 
with a 148 million loan from the carpenters union 
towne square a retirement center in merrillville ind which 
got a 131 million loan from the union 
butler care center in warrandale pa the developers received a 
27 million loan from the union to convert a motel into a nursing 
home 
in addition the unions general board authorized spending an 
additional 7 million to pay for necessary work at some of the 
projects either to complete them or secure the buildings a sixth 
empirerecommended loan for a development in illinois is not in 
default in all the loans and related expenditures total 95 
million 
lucassen said the union hoped to recover as much of the money as 
possible through sales of the properties or its lawsuit but said it 
might have to spend more first to complete work that would make the 
projects more attractive to buyers 
unions generally are tightlipped about their finances but must 
file annual reports with the labor department lucassen said the 
unions report would be filed soon and the organization wanted to 
first publicly disclose the problems so it would not be accused of 
hiding them

utah has joined a dozen other states 
in suing visa usa inc and mastercard international inc for 
allegedly conspiring to slow the introduction of debit cards 
the suit claims the creditcard companies violated antitrust laws 
by conspiring to prevent competitors from launching national debit 
card networks and to inhibit the use of a debit card they developed 
jointly 
visa and mastercard have called the charges unfounded 
a debit card can be presented at stores like a credit card but 
the money is automatically transferred from the cardholders bank 
account to the merchants 
with a credit card credit companies extend funds to a merchant 
to cover the purchase and then bill the consumer credit card 
companies typically receive a fee from the merchant based on a 
percentage of the purchase price and charge consumers interest on 
unpaid balances and annual fees 
besides utah which filed suit on tuesday california 
connecticut louisiana maryland massachusetts minnesota 
tennessee texas washington w virginia wisconsn and new york 
states are plaintiffs in the case

stock prices in london closed higher wednesday on a 
flurry of bargainhunting and some renewed takeoverrelated interest 
but the session overall was marked by modest volume and the 
continued absence of active institutional participation 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed at 
23696 up 83 points or 04 percent but it was substantially off 
its session high of 23798 hit in an early rush the session low 
was the opening of 23663 
volume was 5131 million shares up from tuesdays light 3935 
million shares 
dealers said the news tuesday that ford motor co plans to buy up 
to 15 percent of jaguar plc gave the market a muchneeded shot in 
the arm 
they said that speculation over prospects for other friendly or 
hostile suitors for jaguar helped to rekindle general takeover 
speculation on the london market the government has limited stakes 
in jaguar to 15 percent each until the end of next year 
some buy programs early in the session also helped support the 
market dealers added they attributed the buying the bargain 
opportunities presented by tuesdays moderate declines

a commodity options firm accused of defrauding its 
customers has been fined 100000 by the chicago mercantile 
exchange which stopped short of banning the company from trading 
the firm siegel trading co agreed to improve recordkeeping 
and withdraw from clearing membership at the exchange clearing 
members are the highestranking members of futures exchanges with 
authority to process the trades of lowerranking member firms 
siegel agreed to pay the fine while neither admitting nor denying 
guilt exchange officials said tuesday 
last week the chicagobased company was charged by the commodity 
futures trading commission with using highpressure sales tactics to 
bilk its customers out of more than 30 million

california favored its own rather than its customers best 
interests 
siegel referred calls to its lawyer william phelan who was not 
immediately available to comment on the merc action or the cftc

sure its exciting nerveracking and unique to 
start a major metropolitan newspaper like the st louis sun from 
scratch its also a little weird 
take it from kevin horrigan lead columnist of the tabloid that 
premieres monday 
he traded a columnist job at the historic st louis 
postdispatch founded by joseph pulitzer nearly 111 years ago to 
join the sun which has no history and as it turns out no 
typewriters 
horrigan scoured the suns colorcoordinated hightech 11th 
floor newsroom which overlooks busch stadium and the mississippi 
river for a typewriter 
here we are this is all going to be 21st century 
technology but excuse me im used to having a typewriter said 
horrigan i went out and paid 50 bucks for my own manual 
typewriter as sort of a security blanket 
there are no scraps of obsolete lead type at the sun no dusty 
boxes holding 1950s photographs 
the sun has attracted enormous attention in the stagnant 
newspaper industry because it is new from the newsroom computer 
terminals and electronic page imagers to the cafeteria furniture if 
the sun succeeds it could reverse the conventional thinking that 
new newspapers are a thing of the past 
without printing a word the sun already has attracted 40000 
subscribers and the number is growing daily said the newspapers 
editorinchief ralph ingersoll ii who also is chairman and chief 
executive officer of ingersoll publications co a fastgrowing 
communications concern 
the newspapers 25 million promotional campaign evidently is 
working advertisements have been pouring in so fast that the suns 
sales staff hasnt made sales calls ingersoll said 
we were expecting in the show me state a much more 
standoffish skeptical show me prove it to me attitude he 
said not a day goes by here that we dont pinch ourselves and 
say what the hell is going on here 
ingersolls venture in st louis comes against a background of 
signs that the newspaper business is suffering in many parts of the 
country 
total newspaper circulation in the united states has been flat 
for at least 20 years and the percentage of americans who read 
newspapers has been declining american newspaper publishers 
association statistics show 
in 1988 64 percent of the adult us population read a daily 
newspaper compared with 73 percent in 1973 said association 
spokesman joe lorfano 
no matter what happens in st louis i dont think youre going 
to see many people rushing to try the same thing around the 
country said john morton a washingtonbased newspaper analyst 
morton said only 19 american cities still have two competitive 
newspapers and it appears that number will shrink 
there still are some good oldfashioned newspaper wars but no 
one has sought that kind of thing out morton said 
ingersoll said hes not wading into a newspaper war unarmed 
he noted that as recently as five years ago the nowdefunct st 
louis globedemocrat was the areas most popular paper and total 
paid daily circulation for the globe and the postdispatch was about 
500000 
today the postdispatch has a paid daily circulation of about 
370000 and a sunday circulation of 550000 
ingersoll said he hopes the sun will lure many readers lost when 
newhouse newspapers decided to shut down the globedemocrat 
i think its pretty clear that print has a good future i 
havent the least doubt the st louis sun will be profitable its 
one of the lower risk ventures weve undertaken he said 
ingersoll 43 plans to move from his native connecticut to st 
louis and is shopping for a home in the citys historic central west 
end district 
his other weapons include an energetic staff of 80 editorial 
employees and an established chain of 43 free weekly or biweekly 
newspapers distributed to 700000 homes in suburbs around the city 
the first bomb in what could be a newspaper war came when the sun 
was announced in march and ingersoll hired away thomas m tallarico 
general manager of the postdispatch to be his publisher 
the most recent salvos came when he hired horrigan a popular 
postdispatch columnist and won exclusive use of knight ridder news 
service in the sun 
we definitely welcome competition said postdispatch 
managing editor david lipman we find it exciting and challenging 
it has accelerated some changes that had been proposed or approved 
but not necessarily scheduled 
he said the postdispatch has redesigned its editorial page 
added a news summary on page two moved its news columnist bill 
mcclellan to page three and revamped its calendar section on 
thursdays 
on the frontlines of any battle will be the suns staff 
assembled from all over north america including los angeles new 
york winnipeg miami boston and houston theyve spent the last 
few weeks getting ready for the big debut 
the joke around here has been that we all get cranky unless we 
get our three hours of sleep said managing editor peter 
osullivan who was editorinchief of the houston post before 
coming to st louis 
one problem with bringing in journalists from all over is 
communication said mike thompson the suns editorial cartoonist 
who came from milwaukee 
the lingo thats used is so different i remember having a 
conversation with someone who was telling me to get what they called 
a flat and its something i had always known to be a galley sheet 
said thompson 
other problems no one knows each other no one knows what the 
person at the next desk is doing and everyone is learning as they go 
along 
the whos who problem has been compounded because ingersoll has 
brought in about 20 editors and reporters from some of the companys 
other 47 daily newspapers around the country 
its like putting a basketball team on the court and you dont 
know who can rebound who can dribble who can shoot said 
horrigan its bizarre to take all these people and say ok 
heres what were going to do we think 
ingersoll however says he has a clear vision of whats ahead 
rob dudley the suns art director calls it ralphs vision 
he defines it as a sophisticated colorful quickread newspaper 
we have to get people through our design to trust the 
editorial content dudley said 
the newspaper will be about 90 to 100 pages with color photos 
and artwork on the cover and section fronts it will cost 25 cents 
on weekdays and 1 on saturday 
the paper will publish its expanded weekend edition on saturday 
instead of sunday an idea aimed at further differentiating the sun 
from the postdispatch 
the editorial position of the newspaper will be a pragmatic 
issuesoriented approach that will probably be perceived as leaning 
toward the conservative ingersoll said 
the postdispatch is considered to take more liberal editorial 
positions

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade boosted by fears of 
frost and hopes for new export sales of us grain 
the soybean and soybean oil markets led the rally charged up by 
rumors the agriculture department may be planning to offer vegetable 
oil to poland and the soviet union at subsidized prices 
the talk was keyed to upcoming talks between secretary of state 
james baker and the soviet foreign minister 
indications that china was seeking to buy vegetable oil also 
supported the markets 
corn and soybean prices were bolstered by forecasts for freezing 
temperatures in the midwest early next week although analysts said 
the frost no longer posed much of a threat to the crops 
the september grain and soybean contracts expired at noon cdt 
with wheat at 380 a bushel corn at 234 a bushel oats at 135 
a bushel and soybeans at 568

us commerce secretary robert mosbacher on 
wednesday signed investment and tourism agreements and extended his 
stay to negotiate a pact to persuade american companies to do 
business in the new poland 
the proposed accord would address the concerns of us companies 
considering investing in the economically and politically volatile 
country which has the east blocs only noncommunistled government 
mosbacher and polish foreign trade minister marcin swiecicki are 
discussing how far the new government is willing to go to increase 
western investment through a series of favorable agreements 
the pacts would address removing profits from poland offer 
guarantees against expropriation of property protect technology 
patents and other intellectual property and govern taxation 
i think this will add confidence and comfort and a level of 
excitement for american businesses and bring more to invest in 
poland said mosbacher who extended his stay by one day to 
thursday 
mosbachers visit comes as poles are looking to the west for 
support of the new governments efforts to dismantle four decades of 
communist rule amid what solidarity prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki calls economic chaos 
in washington democrats contending the bush administration is 
failing to back the reforms have proposed a 18 billion aid plan 
that would dwarf a 100 million package offered so far by the white 
house 
neither the comprehensive business and economic agreement 
under discussion nor the agreements signed wednesday has any 
significant cost to the us government mosbacher said 
but they do represent a largely unprecedented encouragement of 
us commerce with a communist country in transition 
solidarity leader lech walesa met with mosbacher in gdansk on 
wednesday and said it will likely be some time before the benefits 
of investment are felt 
the americans propose that poland reduce inflation first and 
then they will provide us with some specific help he said 
i think i managed to persuade mosbacher that it should be the 
other way around because i am sure that without this help we will 
not make it walesa said it would be a vicious circle 
mosbacher and swiecicki one of four remaining communist cabinet 
members signed an agreement to foster contact between american 
business and the developing private sector in poland 
under the pact business experts will be brought to poland and 
management training programs will be developed for an economy in 
which companies have been run by a centralized bureaucracy 
the other agreement is to improve tourism and expand 
opportunities for us investment in hotels and other travel 
projects in poland 
mosbacher stayed at the marriott hotel expected to open next 
month in a skyscraper that was unfinished most of the decade due to 
lack of funds the project is considered a prime example and key 
test of the potential for us investment 
tourists now have legal access to a more favorable exchange rate 
that had been only available only on the black market until currency 
laws were changed earlier in the year 
but they still are required to exchange set amounts and pay for 
lodging and other services at the lower official exchange rate 
a series of programs now before the us congress include a 100 
million fund to promote development of private firms in poland and 
the rewriting of tariff laws to allow 4100 products to be imported 
to the united states without tariffs 
about 70 million of current polish exports would be covered 
including furniture and light machinery

asher edelman t boone pickens jr and herbert 
haft used to make big headlines by stalking big companies but you 
havent heard much from these takeover strategists lately 
they havent left a business that became a major trend of the 
1980s yet for reasons that range from rising costs to 
courtsanctioned obstacles theyve been keeping a low profile one 
theyre likely to maintain for some time 
probably the biggest reason is money prices are too high and 
financing is harder to get now that campeau corp has stumbled 
following its acquisition of federated department stores inc and 
allied stores corp big investors will be even more cautious 
people dont want to chase deals at these high levels said 
economist lawrence chimerine of wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
economic forecasting firm 
said leon lowenstein a professor of corporate finance at 
columbia universitys school of law the prices were sensible 
years ago and in the last five six years increasingly left sanity 
behind 
it is clear that many takeover strategists agree 
last year edelman who bid in the past for lucky stores inc and 
fruehauf corp decided hed had enough of the high prices in the 
united states and began to look for new business in europe he made 
a friendly 12 billion offer for british retailer storehouse plc 
earlier this summer but was rejected 
some big investors are pursuing deals in this country but their 
targets are smaller than earlier targets 
earlier this year groups controlled by revlon group inc 
chairman ronald o perelman bought coleman co inc a camping 
equipment maker for 545 million new world entertainment inc a 
television production company for about 120 million and marvel 
entertainment group inc the comic book company for 825 million 
these transactions are a far cry from the unsuccessful 412 
billion bid perelman made for gillette co in 1986 or the 183 
billion he paid for revlon the previous year 
perelman did undertake a billiondollar acquisition late last 
year but the deal was financed by the federal government 
perelmans group bought five insolvent texas savings and loan 
institutions for 315 million and got a 51 billion cash infusion 
from government 
this last transaction illustrates what takeover strategists are 
looking for deals that are lowpriced or that carry low risks and 
low debt 
the panic in the junk bond market caused by campeaus inability 
to handle its 115 billion debt load will only heighten investor 
caution 
junk bonds suffered heavy losses after campeau said it had to 
restructure and sell its coveted bloomingdales store chain 
campeaus buyout strategy had relied heavily on financing provided 
by the sale of junk bonds debt securities that pay high rates of 
interest in exchange for the high risk of owning them 
with junk bonds currently out of favor it is going to be 
difficult to use them to back a buyout 
to further complicate matters theres been a movement toward 
caution particularly among commercial banks in financing these 
deals said alfred rappaport a professor at northwestern 
universitys kellogg graduate school of management the higher the 
price the more difficult the financing 
chimerine said some people have probably concluded this is a 
time to be more cautious and conservative 
but some takoever strategists have individual reasons for laying 
low 
pickens whose record includes unsuccessful bids for phillips 
petroleum co unocal corp and gulf corp decided earlier this 
year that the hostile takeover business was too frustrating and 
ultimately unsatisfying 
you make the offer and you go through a routine thats similar 
to the last goround and then you dont get the company he said 
in a recent interview 
one of pickens objections which edelman has also cited was 
the number of legal obstacles to buying a company his 1985 bid for 
unocal was stopped by the delaware courts 
also like edelman pickens is exploring his options overseas 
through his privately held boone co pickens has bought a 26 
percent stake in japans koito manufacturing co 
pickens used his mesa limited partnership and its predecessor 
mesa petroleum co to launch past bids but mesa has been 
preoccupied recently with absorbing a tenneco inc subsidiary 
purchased for 715 million last year 
herbert haft and his son robert made a string of hostile attempts 
for retailers including safeway stores inc supermarkets general 
corp dayton hudson corp and most recently a 432 billion bid 
for kroger co in september 1988 
their company dart group corp never acquired their targets 
but the hafts profited handsomely from their stock in the companies 
and earned reputations as corporate raiders observers questioned 
whether they were serious about acquiring a retailer 
in october 1988 dart disclosed that the securities and exchange 
commission staff was investigating whether the firm should be forced 
to register as a company that invests in securities for a pool of 
small investors 
dart was never forced to take that step but the sec action may 
have clipped the hafts wings they havent made a bid since 
the hafts declined to be interviewed but a source close to dart 
said the company has focused on running its trak auto supply and 
crown book stores and shoppers food warehouse operations 
trans world airlines chairman carl icahn another veteran of big 
takeover battles has been sitting on a pile of cash ever since he 
sold his texaco inc holdings for more than 2 billion in june 
immediately after the sale speculation arose that he would bid 
for usx corp in which icahn holds a large stake or that he would 
purchase an interest in continental airlines 
icahn has not made a move and has turned aside questions about 
his plans 
it is likely that if the right deal came along any of these 
investors would go for it 
im not going to completely close the door pickens said 
something could come into range 
one investor who has been notoriously active lately is harold 
simmons who has substantial stakes in georgia gulf corp which he 
has considered bidding for and lockheed corp 
but caution is his watchword too 
i dont go into a major investment or an attempt to buy another 
company unless im ready all the factors are ready simmons said 
in an interview i have to have my own house in order my 
operations all working smoothly and i have to have available 
financing and money 
simmons said he was looking for a good deal and the market 
conditions have to be right 
meanwhile he said im always doing something it may not be 
in the process of a takeover

new york state sued general electric co on 
wednesday to force it to clean up an area surrounding a dump where 
fish containing 22 times the acceptable level of pcbs have been 
found 
the lawsuit filed in us district court asks ge to return to 
work near a rensselear county dump the fairfield connbased 
company spent five years and 23 million cleaning up earlier this 
decade 
but a ge spokesman said the company already has agreed to pay for 
the necessary cleanup and will continue to work with the state 
during the 1950s and 1960s ge dumped 37530 tons of the 
cancercausing pcbs and other chemical wastes at the former dewey 
loeffel dump the company agreed to pay the state 23 million in 
1980 to clean the dump a job that was finished in 1984 
testing done recently showed that pcbs had leaked into the nearby 
nassau lake and valatie kill state attorney general robert abrams 
said 
fish were found to contain pcbs at 22 times the level the federal 
government regards as safe to eat the state has advised the public

a new york court wednesday approved a 15 
million settlement between union carbide corp and 375 former 
employees ending a dispute over payments due from the sale of some 
product lines in 1986 
the former employees or the estates of those who have died will 
receive about 38000 each under the settlement approved by the new 
york state supreme court according to their attorney frederick t 
davis 
the money was owed under a managment incentive program operated 
by union carbide from 1959 to 1970 
the settlement approved by judge elliot wilk also includes 
660000 for legal fees and 81000 for other disbursements 
davis said 
union carbide spokesman ed van den ameele said officials at the 
danburybased corporation had no comment on the settlement 
the dispute arose in 1986 when union carbide successfully fought 
a hostile takover bid by gaf corp but cut staff repurchased some of 
its stock and sold off divisions 
union carbide also promised to pay a special dividend to 
shareholders based on proceeds from the sale of its everyready 
battery line to ralston purina for 14 billion and the sale of its 
line of prestone antifreeze simoniz wax and glad plastic products 
to first brands corp for 800 million 
the dividend was to be equal to the proceeds of two deals less 
book value of those divisions and totaled about 33 a share both 
deals were completed in april 1986 
under the terms of the program the 375 former carbide managers 
were eligibile to receive dividend equivalents giving people who may 
or may not own stock the right to cash payments equal to dividends 
paid shareholders 
but the company said the special dividend was not covered by the 
incentive program and decided not to pay the former employees 
union carbide filed suit in new york supreme court seeking a 
judgment it was not obligated to pay the dividend equivalents the 
375 former employees filed a classaction counterclaim seeking 
payment 
the two sides reached a tentative agreement to settle july 18 
pending approval by the former employees and the court davis said 
payments will be made to the former employees 30 days after the 
judge signs the settlement order 
the surviving former employees who range from 54 to 88 years 
old and the estates of the other former employees will receive 9 
percent interest on their dividends dating from july 18 until actual 
payment davis said

coffee futures prices surged wednesday on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange amid developments that at least momentarily 
appeared to improve the chances for a resumption of export quotas to 
support coffee prices 
on other markets futures prices for energy precious metals 
grains and pork all advanced while cattle futures prices declined 
coffee futures settled 188 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 8255 cents per pound of green 
unroasted coffee 
the market which had languished for most of the day surged late 
in the session on news that president bush had offered support to 
colombian president virgilio barco for a revival of coffee export 
quotas 
coffee prices have fallen by about a third hurting colombias 
economy since the international coffee organization suspended 
export quotas in july due largely to us dissatisfaction with the 
system 
but the market quickly lost interest in the letter from bush 
after learning the president had not altered the united states 
previously stated conditions for rejoining the coffee pact no more 
sales of coffee to nonmember nations and greater availability of 
highquality arabica coffee beans 
the president had a very sympathetic response but our 
objectives remain unchanged said bert ruiz a vice president with 
the futures brokerage balfour maclaine corp in new york 
the letter quickly was replaced by another ostensibly bullish 
factor a report that jorge cardenas president of the colombia 
national coffee federation would meet in washington on friday with 
us trade negotiator robert murphy before both of them travel to 
london for a twoweek meeting of the international coffee 
organization beginning monday 
the report renewed speculation that uscolombian cooperation 
would lead to a new coffee agreement 
but analyst kim badenhop of merrill lynch capital markets inc 
said the murphycardenas meeting had been planned for some time and 
predicted the ico meeting would produce nothing substantial 
the most positive thing to come out of that meeting would be 
that maybe they would talk about quotas and agree to come back at a 
later date badenhop said but i dont even think well get 
that 
energy futures rose sharply on the new york mercantile exchange 
led by the gasoline market on fears of hurricane hugos threat to 
refinery operations in the caribbean sea and the us gulf coast 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 34 cents 
higher with november at 1968 a barrel heating oil was 105 cents 
to 160 cents higher with october at 5655 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 1 cent to 207 cents higher with october at 5974 cents 
a gallon 
gold and silver futures rose strongly on new yorks commodity 
exchange in response to oils gains and a weaker dollar 
gold settled 350 to 430 higher with october at 36570 a troy 
ounce silver was 55 cents to 68 cents higher with september at 
5119 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade boosted by fears of frost and hopes for new export 
sales of us grain 
wheat futures settled cent to 1 cents higher with december at 
391 a bushel corn was cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
december at 228 a bushel oats were cent lower to 1 cent higher 
with december at 135 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 7 cents 
higher with november at 575 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange frozen pork belly futures 
soared the 2centsapound daily limit in a rally inspired by 
technical factors analysts said 
the runup supported hog futures which also settled higher but 
cattle futures finished slightly lower 
live cattle settled 07 cent to 28 cent lower with october at 
7115 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 38 cent lower 
with september at 8290 cents a pound hog futures were 10 cent to

call it the mystery of the missing mercedes 
15 of them in fact the luxury cars most of them gas guzzlers all 
failed to show in the environmental protection agencys auto mileage 
survey this week 
was it an innocent lapse or by design 
among the 981 cars whose expected gasoline efficiency was 
detailed in the epa list and then widely distributed by the news 
media were cars ranging from the 58mpg geo metro to the 6mpg 
lamborghini countach not to mention a half dozen versions of the 
rollsroyce 
but no mercedesbenz 
don larson branch manager at the epas auto testing laboratory 
in ann arbor mich said that every year some cars perhaps 80 or 
90 do not make the list because manufacturers do not provide the 
testing data for certification early enough to make the deadline for 
sending the list to the printer 
nevertheless he said it would be unusual for a manufacturer 
to have his entire product line not listed 
federal law requires automakers to submit the data and have it 
approved before a car may be put on the market but larson said 
there is no requirement that the test data be submitted by a 
specific date or meet the deadline for the initial list which gets 
the widespread publicity 
larson said in a telephone interview i dont know what was in 
the minds of mercedes in making their decision but they do have 
relatively fuel inefficient vehicles 
indeed 11 of the mercedes cars showed overall mileage of 18 
miles per gallon or less and are subject to a gas guzzler excise 
tax according to figures provided upon request to the associated 
press by the epa those 11 would bring the number of official 
guzzlers to 43 in the 1990 model year compared with 40 on the 
initial list for the previous year 
at least three of the 1990 mercedes models had mileage so low 
they likely would have been among the worst ten in mileage for 
1990 had they been included in the epa survey 
the original list of 1989 models did include 12 mercedes cars 
seven of them official gas guzzlers 
the mercedes mileage figures were submitted to the epas 
certification office in ann arbor on sept 9 four days after the 
agency deadline and two days after the information already had gone 
to the printer according to eldert bontekoe an official at the 
certification office 
ab shuman manager of public relations at mercedesbenz of 
north america in montvale nj said in an interview that the 
mileage performance of the cars was absolutely not a factor in 
the data being submitted late 
it was just getting it all done said shuman who said that 
the company had been unable to complete all of the testing in time 
epa officials said they were unaware of any testing backlog at 
mercedesbenz 
shuman also noted that mercedes does not put its 1990 models on 
the market until nov 1 and therefore absent any specific 
government deadline has more time to submit the test data than many 
other automakers whose 1990 models hit the showroom in september and 
october 
we sometimes miss the filing deadline i guess its not the 
first time we havent been included in the first publication of the 
mileage list said shuman he said at times a delay has worked 
to our disadvantage when diesel models with relatively high 
mileage werent included 
the mileage data for the mercedes cars along with figures for 
any other cars submitted late will be included in an updated 
mileage list in february 
but epa spokeswoman martha casey acknowledged that the revised 
list usually gets little public attention the epa normally doesnt 
even distribute a press release she said

an investor group said wednesday it 
has canceled plans to buy the claridge casino hotel leaving the 
financially strapped business again looking for a buyer 
alfred j luciani president of alm moonstone inc said his 
investor partnership could not reach agreement with claridge 
officials over money and time 
the deal originally contemplated an aug 15 closing but claridge 
officials said continued negotiations made it unclear whether the 
deal could close this year 
a statement issued wednesday announced that the claridge board of 
directors voted monday to stop negotiations with alm moonstone 
instead the claridge corp will concentrate on renewing its gaming 
license which expires oct 31 
the way the deal was structured it would have left us with 
severe tax consequences if itclosed in 1990 said shannon bybee 
chairman of the claridge board of directors 
it wasnt a problem when we were talking about an aug 15 
closing but the claridge decided it was just too risky to continue 
negotiating he said too many things could happen to prevent it 
from closing this year 
luciani who is a former vice president of the former golden 
nugget casino and 11 other partners signed an agreement april 15 to 
buy the struggling claridge a 501room gaming hall one block from 
the atlantic city boardwalk the purchase price was undisclosed 
at the time luciani announced plans to rename the claridge 
restructure the gaming floor and offer better odds to gamblers 
the claridge lost about 20 million in 1988 on revenue of 1746 
million in june claridge corp took control of the casino hotel 
from the del webb corp of phoenix after completing a financial 
restructuring plan 
luciani said the deal fell through because there were questions 
about whether the deal was worth it under their terms and time 
constraints 
failing to meet the claridge directors deadline he said would 
have led to economic consequences that would have created a 
substantial increase in price 
the claridges casino license expires oct 31 and company 
attorneys need to spend time concentrating on the relicensing 
hearings next month bybee said 
at this point we feel comfortable that we can convince the 
casino control commission that we will be financially viable for the 
next two years he said 
but bybee said the claridge still needed to find a buyer that 
would provide the capital infusion needed for refurbishing the 
hotelcasino 
we would have to do things piecemeal and we believe its 
important to the claridges longterm viability to get it done so 
the simplest way to do it is to sell bybee said 
bybee who said the claridge would consider a sale again next 
year had received numerous contacts by interested parties after the 
aug closing date passed

the government said wednesday it broke up a 
13state 2 million money laundering scheme indicting a dozen 
people and seizing 67 currency exchanges in what prosecutors called 
the largest bust of its kind 
a ninemonth sting operation by undercover internal revenue 
service agents found a string of currency exchanges willing to 
launder money they were told came from the sale of a ton of cocaine 
us attorney anton valukas said 
the exchanges were concentrated in chicago texas georgia and 
massachusetts he said 
valukas said cash was delivered to the exchanges which would 
break down 20000 amounts into four separate 5000 money orders 
federal law requires currency transaction reports to the irs on 
amounts over 10000 and prohibits restructuring transactions to 
evade requirements 
the apparent willingness of some financial institutions to put 
their facilities at the disposal of people whom they believe have 
ties to the criminal and narcotics community presents an enormous 
problem for american society valukas said 
this is the single largest indictment of its kind involving 
currency exchanges he added 
the 61count racketeering indictment alleges that leonard keller 
of skokie who has a half or partial interest in all 67 exchanges 
arranged to have the dealers facilitate currency transactions of 
more than 10000 
during the undercover operation from june 1988 to march 31 
kellers exchanges illegally processed 2 million in government 
money ranging from 14000 to 200000 at a time the indictment 
says 
the exchanges under the name of check cashers in most of the 
states were placed under the control of the us marshals service 
they will continue operating under the agencys supervision valukas 
said 
the exchanges could be forfeited under the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act if the defendants are 
convicted a judge froze the 13 defendants interests in the 
currency exchanges wednesday 
harvey silets kellers attorney denied the charges and called 
the seizure of control of the exchanges an outrageous exercise in 
government authority 
drug traffickers often convert large amounts of cash into small 
money orders and avoiding attention they would otherwise draw from 
investigators if they were to use large amounts to make purchases 
valukas said 
keller is charged with two counts of racketeering 30 counts of 
structuring currency 22 counts of evading reporting six counts of 
using interstate facilities for racketeering and one count of making 
false statements to prosecutors 
he faces 365 years in prison if convicted on all counts fines of 
28 million and forfeiture of his business interests in the 
exchanges 
david weisbaum a manager of a chicago exchange is charged with 
two counts of racketeering three counts of structuring currency and 
two counts of evading reporting 
charged with racketeering and use of interstate facilities for 
the practice are exchange managers carl franco atlanta mark 
brotman decatur ga philip singer san antonio edward franco 
boston steven waitzman new orleans timothy urwin cincinnati and 
robert peterson jacksonville fla 
charged only with racketeering are minerva franco a cashier in 
el paso texas mark sonshine a manager in indianapolis and herman 
diehl a manager in portsmouth va 
the defendants face possible maximum penalties of five years and 
500000 on each violation of reporting requirements 10 years and 
250000 for use of interstate facilities and 20 years and 250000 
for racketeering

apple executives defended their new 
portable macintosh computer wednesday as a friendly pc whose 
spectrum of features makes up for its heavy construction bulky 
build and intimidating price 
at a lavish laser lightlaced unveiling of the portable 
macintosh john sculley apple computer incs chairman and chief 
executive officer said he was confident people will want the 
portable computer despite the fact it is too heavy for many laps 
and more expensive than some new cars 
we have had people say i wish it were lighter i wish it were 
cheaper how can i buy one sculley said we went for a 
macintosh product without compromise 
the macintosh portable gives users all the power and features 
they would find in a fullsize macintosh including snazzy graphics 
with the added bonus of portability and battery operation for up to 
12 hours the company said 
cupertinobased apple hopes to sell the macintosh portable to 
people who already own or use the fullsized macintosh and want an 
easytouse compatible portable the company also is looking to 
sell it to colleges and universities traveling business people and 
operators of small companies 
allan loren president of apple usa said that as of wednesday 
20000 macintosh portables had been ordered for 100 million in 
revenue 
but computer industry analysts have greeted the new offering with 
a lukewarm response citing the computers weight and high price 
the portable lists at 5799 or 6499 with an optional 
40megabyte hard disk to store data it costs an extra 449 for a 
modem for communication over phone lines 
the computer weighs 137 pounds or 157 pounds with the optional 
hard disk too heavy to reasonably be called a lap top that makes 
it heavier by more than a pound than portables manufactured by 
international business machines corp and compaq computer corp 
jeanlouis gassee president of apple acknowledged that the 
computers weight may worry some wouldbe buyers but stressed that 
its computers features make up for any disadvantages 
all i know is when people touch it when they put their hands 
on it they want it even if its heavier he said 
the macintosh portables screen though onetone rather than 
color is unusually sharp thanks to a separate transistor for each 
screen dot or picture element 
the screen has more than 250000 picture elements in a 640 by 400 
array making the screen 50 percent larger than the screen on a 
macintosh se 
sculley declined to say whether a japanese company supplied the 
screen but said we are confident we have a good supply 
to conserve the portables battery power apple used a lowpower 
kind of memory chip and a version of the motorola 68000 processor 
chip that requires 80 percent less power the rechargeable lead acid 
batteries last six to 12 hours apple said 
apple also announced the macintosh iici an advanced version of 
the macintosh iicx which it billed as the most powerful macintosh 
that apple has ever developed 
the macintosh iici ranges in price from 6269 to 9152 putting 
it in the price range of some computer work stations machines 
designed for scientists and engineers the macintosh iici delivers 
55 percent higher performance than the macintosh iicx or iix and has 
builtin video capabilities apple said

private investors will begin to provide 
services such as cellular phones and data transmission in 
competition with the government telephone monopoly the salinas 
administration said wednesday 
communications and transportation secretary andres caso said the 
change would be part of the transfer of majority control of 
telefonos de mexico to the private sector announced monday by 
president carlos salinas de gortari 
the plan to decrease state ownership in the company known as 
telmex from 56 percent to 25 percent comes under a program of 
government withdrawal from nonstrategic and unprofitable firms 
caso said the government will focus on what he said was its basic 
responsibility meeting the countrys social needs 
plans call for 10 billion in investment in telmex over the next 
five years caso said of that he said private investment will 
provide 3 billion and the rest will come from reinvestment of 
profits by current owners 
gradually we will pull out of ownership caso said 
foreign participation is now limited to the 25 percent of telmex 
traded on the new york stock exchange he said 
he would not identify private companies involved in negotiations 
but he said some foreign companies are interested 
any new investment must have majority mexican participation he 
said he added that no foreign individual or company may own more 
than 10 percent of telmex 
telmex would retain control of basic telephone service but new 
competition in the other areas would be healthy caso added 
such concessions would be renewable every five years and require 
companies to prove their service records he said 
the main goal is to improve service describing phone service in 
mexico as bad he added that the company is way behind in 
meeting needs for new installations 
despite the poor service the company is financially healthy 
he said he said there is a limit to public expenditures and private 
capital can fill the gap 
without new investment it would take 15 years to meet urgent 
needs he said 
part of the restructuring will involve establishing new quality 
standards for phone service 
caso quieted fears that workers might lose their jobs and said 
that foreign participation would not affect mexicos sovereignty 
phone company employees also will be allowed to purchase a 
stilltobedetermined percentage of the company 
he said the government will will announce the complete 
privatization plan next month 
salinas on monday told telephone workers that the government will 
maintain regulatory control of the company as its ownership 
decreases to 25 percent 
telmex has been in government hands for 16 years

striking coal miners ended their fourday 
occupation of a coal processing plant wednesday hours after 
ignoring a judges ultimatum to leave the plant or be removed by 
force 
union officials promised to use similar tactics in the coming 
weeks against the pittston coal group inc the target of the united 
mine workers strike that began april 5 
umw vice president cecil roberts carrying an american flag led 
the miners out of the pittston plant at 920 pm and declared the 
occupation a success 
were going to hurt this company economically he said 
were going to cut off their production until they wake up and 
were going to do it peacefully 
roberts who did not participate in the occupation said the next 
move to cut off coal production could come next week but he wouldnt 
elaborate asked why the union decided to bring the miners out 
roberts said were going to use them again 
protected by 3000 miners and union supporters who rallied 
outside the plant the 98 miners inside ignored a 7 pm deadline 
set by us district judge glen williams 
williams said the miners would face no federal penalties if they 
left before 7 pm otherwise they should be prepared to be carried 
out by force 
some state troopers drove off at dusk and law enforcement 
authorities let the deadline pass without trying to get inside the 
plant two hundredfifty miners in camouflage clothes blocked the 
road to the plant 
the union leadership and the striking miners inside the plant 
pledged earlier in the day to maintain the occupation as long as 
they could 
theyre going to have to haul us out of here said eddie 
burke one of the occupiers and the umws southeast regional 
coordinator if theyve got enough jail cells and enough buses 
im sure theyll get us eventually were not going to resist 
the judge said strikers who remained in the plant would lose 
their 200 a week in umw strike benefits and face contempt charges 
and the union would be fined 600000 for each day of the occupation 
hopefully the union will peacefully vacate without having to 
do so by force williams said during a hearing in abingdon i 
not only hope but pray that they have the sense to come out 
williams said he was concerned that an assault on the building 
would be dangerous even though the demonstrators were unarmed i 
can visualize a lot of things that would be unpleasant he said 
the men were ocupying a plant control room reachable only by way 
of a narrow staircase 
meanwhile sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the 
senate labor committee announced wednesday evening that the 
committee was launching an investigation of the labor dispute 
between pittston and the umw 
kennedy said the panel would hold a public hearing on the matter 
once the investigation was completed he did not give a timetable 
for the review 
pittstons 1695 umw employees from virginia west virginia and 
kentucky went on strike in a contract dispute union members at 
other coal companies staged wildcat strikes in june and july 
the miners and one religious leader had stormed the plant sunday 
equipped with gas masks sleeping bags and food and water for 10 
days when only a dozen security officers were on the grounds 
they barricaded themselves inside the control room and shut down 
production at the plant where coal is cleaned sorted and shipped 
replacement workers had been operating the plant since the strike 
began april 5 although production has been about half of normal 
union leaders said they wanted to halt production force pittston 
co chairman paul douglas to join contract negotiations and make a 
dramatic public statement about what they consider unfair treatment 
by the company which they contend is trying to break the union 
massive fines have taken away all other avenues of peaceful 
protest such as sitdown demonstrations and mass picketing they 
said 
pittston president michael odom called the demonstrators 
terrorists and said their actions amounted to extortion we cannot 
and will not negotiate with terrorists he said 
umw spokesman joe corcoran said odom was closing the door to a 
peaceful solution he said the demonstrators have done no damage to 
plant property and were armed only with playing cards and checkers
