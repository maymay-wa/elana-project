a suspect in the killing of five 
college students said he knew who killed two victims and gave a 
name police believe is one of his multiple personalities a 
newspaper reported friday 
edward lewis humphrey 18 has been held in the brevard county 
jail on charges of assaulting his grandmother but has not been 
charged in any of the gainesville killings 
the florida timesunion in jacksonville citing unidentified 
sources said in its early saturday editions that after he was 
arrested aug 30 he talked to officers about the killings of the 
first two victims christina powell 17 and sonja larson 18 
they were found aug 26 in their gainesville apartment 
he said he knew who killed the two and blamed one of the 
personalities he has appeared to exhibit the timesunion reported 
the newspaper did not print the name but during a bond hearing 
thursday a jail guard had testified that humphrey referred to 
himself as john 
humphreys lawyer public defender j r russo told the 
associated press he was unaware of any such statements by his 
client 
its news to me he said 
he added that he had been concerned all along about humphreys 
initial interrogation which took place with no lawyer present 
so far authorities have refused to discuss publicly what 
humphrey said in any statement 
meanwhile police said friday that they have gathered 
promising evidence but cautioned that they dont expect any 
immediate results 
police would provide no details about what information was 
gathered in searches of humphreys gainesville apartment his car 
and his grandmothers home in indialantic a coastal city about 180 
miles southeast of gainesville 
we did not leave emptyhanded lt sadie darnell said but 
added that lab tests will take time to tell if they have anything 
useful as evidence 
besides the searches of the homes and car agents obtained a 
personal search warrant for humphrey that could yield evidence on 
bodily fluids fingerprints and hair 
agents spent thursday searching humphreys apartment and the 
13room twostory house in indialantic humphreys car was loaded 
onto a flatbed car carrier and taken to a state crime lab in 
jacksonville where it was to be searched 
evidence gathered at both scenes and in brevard county is 
promising ms darnell said 
despite the intense interest in humphrey police continue to say 
he is one of eight suspects and no arrests are imminent police 
canceled weekend news briefings saying no significant developments 
are expected 
we are not going to identify anyone as a no 1 suspect ms 
darnell said adding police had received 3670 leads so far 
new charges of aggravated assault have been filed against 
humphrey as a result of a confrontation the night before the first 
two bodies were discovered 
greg herskowitz and rob lipvak two 18yearold pi lambda phi 
pledges claim humphrey threatened them with a knife at the 
fraternity house aug 25 
humphrey is being held on 1 million bond in an attack on his 
79yearold grandmother he also faces charges in indian river 
county of armed burglary and attempted sexual battery two years ago 
police disclosed for the first time friday that manuel taboada 
the only man killed by the serial slayer was asleep in bed when he 
was slain 
he was apparently surprised by his attacker ms darnell 
said 
besides larson and powell the other victims were christa hoyt 
19 and taboadas roommate tracy paules 23 
dr michael west who spent 1 days studying the three murder 
scenes said he believes the killer was wearing gloves because he 
left virtually no trace of himself 
i thought id seen everything he said in a taping of the 
donahue show that was broadcast live in gainesville friday 
when the full story is released youll be shocked and amazed 
the show was almost knocked off the air when a man riding a 
bicycle stopped and cut cables to five of six cameras police said 
the man was not caught

a gunman who held police at bay for 5 hours 
friday ended the standoff by shooting himself in the head and 
falling from atop a 16story building in one of the citys busiest 
neighborhoods authorities said 
paul a fisher 30 of pittsburgh was propelled forward off an 
apartment buildings roof by a single shot from a handgun about 
510 pm said police chief mayer deroy he was pronounced dead at 
the scene 
no one on the ground was injured 
he said he was going to jump since we wouldnt assassinate 
him deroy said 
fisher who had a history of mental illness and problems at 
home apparently was trying to draw attention to himself on the 
apartment buildings roof deroy said 
he wore a bright orange hat and blue shortsleeved shirt and 
had 50 rounds of ammunition in a duffel bag deroy said 
about noon fisher fired one shot from a 22caliber rifle at an 
unmarked police car and 11 other rifle shots into the air police 
said 
two roman catholic schools were evacuated and a four to 
fiveblock area was blocked off to traffic 
police believed they were making progress 15 minutes before 
fisher killed himself because he turned over the rifle to police 
negotiators 
fisher climbed a drainpipe to get to the roofs tallest parapet 
and smoked a cigarette on a ledge deroy said 
he then put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger the 
chief said i told him we werent interested in prosecuting him 
criminally we were only interested in getting him help 
fisher killed himself before hundreds of onlookers and several 
tv crews local pittsburgh newscasts did not air the videotape 
while national cnn headline news did 
he told police he was up on the roof half an hour with weapons 
and no one was paying attention to him so he fired at the unmarked 
police car with the 22caliber rifle 
deroy said the man threw scrap paper over the side of the 
building to see how long it took to fall to the ground 
fisher fired the first shot at an unmarked police car shortly 
before noon said assistant police chief donald aubrecht over the 
next several hours he fired several other rounds into the air and 
occasionally pointed the rifle at the ground without shooting 
police sharpshooters took up positions on rooftops near the 
16story moorehead towers said public safety spokeswoman margaret 
philbin the building houses the elderly and handicapped in the 
citys oakland section 
four police officers tried to talk with the sniper from a 
stairway on the outside of the building ms philbin said 
all he wants is a coke and cigarettes they threw him a 
bunch she said 
more than 50 police officers were at the scene and cordoned off 
an area of about four or five blocks around the building snarling 
traffic in the heavily populated area near the university of 
pittsburgh 
students at two roman catholic schools near the apartments were 
led out the schools back doors to safety and continued classes at 
another school also in oakland

a former cia agent earned at least 843000 for 
supplying weapons during the irancontra affair according to 
prosecution evidence presented friday 
the government is trying to prove that thomas g clines 62 of 
middleburg va failed to report all of his irancontra earnings 
on his tax returns clines also is charged with failing to report 
his overseas financial accounts to the internal revenue service 
clines reported gross earnings of 265000 for the tax year 1985 
and 402513 for 1986 according to a fourcount indictment 
returned here in february 
according to documents presented in court clines received 
423534 for helping procure arms for the contra rebels in 1985 he 
earned 420238 in 1986 according to testimony 
when the trial in us district court resumes monday the 
government will call witnesses expected to testify about additional 
profits clines and the other irancontra figures earned 
during six hours of testimony swiss financier willard i zucker 
identified dozens of financial documents and memos outlining how 
the arms deal profits were split among retired maj gen richard 
secord iranianborn businessman albert hakim and clines 
zucker who works at a genevabased financial services company 
that handled money for the arms deals testified that hakim and 
secord asked the firm to alter some records 
cash would come into the accounts it was never explained to 
us what that cash was used for or where it was from zucker said 
when cash was going out no one explained to us why we were 
making that payment we didnt receive invoices 
we were told by our clients that this was a white house covert 
operation we were not encouraged to ask questions we were 
supposed to keep track of the money we did the best we could he 
said 
zucker testified that hakim asked the company to revise account 
statements but he did not know when the changes were made or what 
they included 
he said financial documents presented at clines trial were not 
among those altered 
the irancontra affair was disclosed to the public in november 
1986 congressional investigators used hakims financial records to 
trace the paper trail of the scheme during profits from arms sales 
to iran were diverted to rebels trying to overthrow the nicaraguan 
government despite a congressional ban on such funding 
secord testified wednesday that he believed some of the ledgers 
recording the irancontra arms transactions were falsified but said 
he had never seen a forged document related to clines profits 
secord and hakim each earned 139 million during 1985 and 1986 
the documents showed 
in addition 141084 in profits was received by scitech a 
company jointly owned by hakim and secord according to the 
documents presented in court 
secord pleaded guilty last year to a felony count of making 
false statements to the irancontra congressional committees he 
was sentenced in january to two years probation 
clines faces up to 16 years in prison and fines of up to 1 
million if convicted

if hostilities erupt in the 
middle east the air force will be armed with smart and deadly 
hightech weapons developed as a result of hard lessons learned the 
last time america went to war 
the southeast asia conflict changed armament development 
forever said julie massoni historian for the air force 
development test center at eglin air force base in the florida 
panhandle 
the air force gave low priority to conventional bombs missiles 
and guns before the vietnam war focusing on aircraft development 
and nuclear arms massoni said 
as a result highperformance jets were saddled with outdated 
munitions some dating to world war ii that limited their 
capabilities in vietnam 
in the late 1960s us jets armed with iron bombs flew more 
than 800 sorties against the than hoa bridge losing at least 10 
aircraft and failing to bring down the span 
in 1972 four f4 phantom ii jets took only 15 minutes to 
destroy the bridge with the first smart bombs the laserguided 
paveway i glide bombs were used with similar success against a 
second bridge 
the precision guided munitions that took out the bridges have 
been termed by some as the most revolutionary change in the art of 
warfare since the nuclear bomb massoni said 
eglins development test center established in 1968 has been 
responsible for many of those weapons and has even more formidable 
bombs and missiles in the final stages of development 
in general these weapons tend to work extemely well if no 
countermeasures are taken said steve kosiak a senior analyst 
with the center for defense information a private think tank in 
washington dc 
the problem he said is most have not yet been tried in battle 
against opposing military forces that can use electronic trickery 
to fool radarguided weapons or smoke to mask targets from 
television and laserguided bombs and missiles 
one exception has been the successful use of laserguided bombs 
in the us raid on libya 
kosiak said the high cost of smart weapons limits their use 
to highvalue targets oldfashioned iron bombs may still be the 
weapon of choice against such targets as factories and massed 
armies he said 
however merely having a hightech weapon even if it doesnt 
work all the time may inhibit an enemy kosiak said opposing 
forces may not turn on antiaircraft radar to avoid having it 
destroyed by a radarseeking missile 
the air force arsenal of smart weapons now includes the 
paveway iii an advanced laserguided bomb and the gbu15 an even 
more accurate televisionguided glide bomb in tests a gbu15 hit 
a billboardtype target measuring 40 feet by 40 feet after being 
dropped five miles away 
eglin has completed development of a rocketpowered version the 
agm130 missile that can be launched from at least 15 miles no 
decision has yet been made on production because of the cost 
according to maj wayne warren of owensboro ky lead engineer for 
the project 
the air force already has a televisionguided infrared missile 
the maverick introduced in 1972 but it is a relative lightweight 
at 426 pounds the agm130 like the gbu15 actually is a kit for 
converting existing 2000pound bombs of which there are thousands 
a tv guidance pod bolted to the nose makes a bomb smart and 
adding the rocket motor to the tail turns it into a missile warren 
said 
another weapon developed during the vietnam war is the shrike 
missile that homes in on enemy radar used to guide antiaircraft 
missiles an advanced version known as the harm or high speed 
antiradiation missile was deployed in 1983 
for airtoair combat us fighters are armed with the 
intermediate range radarguided sparrow and the shortrange 
heatseeking sidewinder missiles the sidewinder was deployed in 
1953 and the sparrow 10 years later but each has undergone 
numerous modifications to improve performance 
the new advanced intermediate range airtoair missile or 
amraam will give pilots launch and leave capability because it 
has its own tiny but powerful radar for guidance it also allows 
pilots to fire at more than one target at the same time 
about 175 amraams have been built but a reliability problem has 
delayed fullscale production said brig gen charles franklin 
amraam project director 
improvements in the manufacturing process are curing the problem 
and the first operational versions are expected to be delivered 
later this year he said

the paratrooper recalls 
stepping off the plane a month ago among the first american 
soldiers to reach saudi arabia 
instant sweat it had me wishing we were back in panama the 
24yearold north carolinian said asking that his name not be used 
but we were pumped ready for instant war our feeling then 
was that war was inevitable he said interviewed at the camp 
first named allamerican city and then changed to champion city 
because of saudi objections 
now uncertainty has replaced inevitability with no enemy to 
fight the desert heat and deepening boredom are the most common 
foes 
wed like to know how long were going to stay said marine 
maj drew bennett of new orleans we dont know anything 
morale remains generally high among us troops but keeping it 
high as operation desert shield drags on could be a daunting 
challenge exacerbated by saudi customs that prohibit alcohol and 
discourage women from venturing into saudi communities 
they need to tell me when im going home air force staff 
sgt kenneth williams said ive got a wife and two kids 
among the troops whether air force personnel sleeping in 
airconditioned tents army infantry in trailers or marines under 
the desert sky come the usual complaints the food the heat the 
slow mail service and the shortage of recreational facilities 
theres not a whole lot you can do and theres no time to do 
it in anyway air force sgt chris jessen said during a break 
from working on an f15 fighter jet 
after weeks of grumbling a mail system is taking shape but 
that means some soldiers without letters have to watch others savor 
the words from loved ones 
military chaplains are trying to collect and evenly distrubute 
mail addressed to any soldier any sailor or any airman 
air force officials believed they scored a moraleboosting coup 
when they won time for the troops even women at an 80 million 
saudi military recreational facility that includes a swimming pool 
bowling alley weight room and other equipment 
some women are upset because they have to enter through the back 
door because of saudi sensitivities 
being able to get the ladies in there at all is amazing 
said air force spokesman lt col tom sack 
the military brass is also trying to do more for morale 
gen h norman schwarzkopf made a tour of several camps last 
week and word is circulating that gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff may visit next week 
the us consulate is trying to help out by arranging a talent 
show 
well have to do some different things to keep up morale 
said col john lemoyne of the 24th mechanized infantry division 
everybody would probably like a cold beer right now but thats 
just not the name of the game over here 
every unit seems to have an entertainer or comedian among the 
ranks 
at the 82nd airborne one of the men entertains the troops by 
reciting lines from old war movies 
a member of a security patrol at a saudi airbase hopped out of 
his vehicle the other day during a sandstorm to etch a message on 
the sandcrusted back window

american troops are clad in the 
latest in combat clothing stylish twopiece suits specially 
designed for desert duty but some soldiers are not convinced 
their fashionable duds are functional 
theyre very hot and very uncomfortable said army lt col 
gene w cole clad in his jumpsuit 
its hot and it makes me sweat complained lt col ned 
longsworth 
said air force capt becky colaw theres a big difference 
wearing it for work and wearing it to be cool 
the uniforms with a pattern called chocolatechip 
camouflage are 50 percent cotton and 50 percent nylon a 
combination designed to make the material tough but breathable 
they come in varying tints the lightest blends in well with the 
sand and is the most popular but the fabric is too heavy for the 
100plus desert temperatures troops say 
gis generally keep their tunics on when theyre outside to 
prevent sunburn the american women have been told to stay covered 
so as not to offend saudi sensibilities about bare skin 
a rumpled forage hat visored cap or jaunty beret is de rigeur 
a cotton scarf to wipe sweat from the brow or guard against a 
sunburned neck is another musthave accessory 
slung around the soldiers waists are the trappings of desert 
life a chemical gas mask canteen flashlight knife an m16 
slung over the shoulder is part of the uniform for some soldiers 
soldiers give the uniforms high marks for comfort 
the baggy trousers have six pockets including cargo pockets for 
notebooks and assorted items the tunic top has four pockets 
theyre designed to wear well even when theyre dirty said 
maj peggy sweet an air force logistics officer based at myrtle 
beach sc 
but the fit can be a problem for some 
like couturier outfits from paris and milan the outfits hang 
best on those who are tall and thin 
its a problem if youre short and fat said ms colaw 
troops from all services were issued two or three uniforms 
before they left the united states the outfits were specially 
designed for desert situations and this is the first time they 
have been used in a deployment 
tshirts and underwear were not part of the package provided 
soldiers so ms colaw said she bought herself male boxer shorts 
because theyre cooler than the womens kind

the united states needs to solve the persian 
gulf crisis at the negotiating table rather than on the 
battlefield the nations largest black church body has declared 
we recall that our christ reminds us that he or she who lives 
by the sword will perish by the sword said a resolution approved 
friday by delegates to the 110th annual meeting of the national 
baptist convention usa inc 
the 78 millionmember denomination supported president bushs 
decision to send us troops to the middle east but said the 
nation must deal with iraqi leader saddam hussein at an 
international conference table 
i just cant see lives being taken fighting over oil the 
rev tj jemison convention president said after the vote 
the resolution was unanimously approved without discussion by 
about 1500 delegates representing the nations third largest 
protestant denomination 
the baptist convention said bush was correct to send troops to 
the middle east after iraqs invasion of kuwait to enable the 
nation to negotiate from a position of strength 
but there are other moral issues involved the resolution said 
we contend that if the united states wishes for the world to 
move toward a democratic society no matter how horrific the 
position of saddam hussein might appear we must deal with him in a 
manner that he and all powers concerned in the middle east are led 
to the world conference table for a meaningful negotiated 
settlement of the conflict the resolution said 
pursuing a negotiated settlement through diplomacy will save 
lives and billions of dollars best spent to feed the hungry 
clothe the naked heal the sick train the unlearned house the 
homeless and encourage the lonely the resolution added 
the denomination also commended the rev jesse jackson for 
helping secure the release of some hostages 
the rev amos brown chairman of the human rights commission 
said the vote sends a message that us foreign policy needs to be 
consistent and not ignore human rights violations in nations such 
as kuwait saudi arabia and israel 
for instance were not invading south africa to halt 
apartheid he said 
most major religious groups have responded cautiously to the 
us military deployment in the middle east balancing a 
condemnation of the iraqi invasion of kuwait with concerns that the 
united states act out of humanitarian motives rather than to 
protect oil interests

asked why they have not deployed ground troops in 
saudi arabia alongside us forces americas allies have an easy 
answer the saudis havent invited them 
this reply however accurate has failed to prevent increasingly 
strident calls in the united states for its allies to share more of 
the military burden and the risks in the showdown with iraqs 
saddam hussein 
britain says it plans to send more forces to the persian gulf 
possibly including ground troops but other western european 
countries show no signs of similar action citing the lack of a 
formal saudi invitation and various other reasons 
france which has mounted the secondlargest western deployment 
in the gulf in the form of a naval task force says it will not 
help finance the us effort and would probably join ground 
operations only under un auspices 
portugal which has committed one naval support vessel to the 
gulf says its ground and air units wouldnt be effective 
west germany and japan say their constitutions bar them from 
deploying forces in faroff regions although the germans have 
suggested the possibility of a constitutional amendment 
greece italy and australia which have dispatched a total of 
nine warships to the gulf say no one asked them to send ground 
troops and the subject hasnt been considered 
it wasnt necessary said vittorio surdo an italian foreign 
ministry spokesman we think our contribution is important enough 
in other respects 
us officials say the cost of the 100000strong american force 
in the region is about 1 billion a month they are lobbying hard 
for larger financial contributions from allies 
the nations of the european community agreed friday to give 2 
billion in economic aid to turkey jordan and egypt to compensate 
them for trade lost as a result of sanctions against iraq however 
the 12 ec states made no promises to contribute to the cost of 
deploying us troops in the persian gulf 
after the meeting italys foreign minister gianni de michelis 
told reporters we want to contribute to the burdensharing in an 
independent and direct manner and not to the expenses of a separate 
country even though it is an ally 
so far president bushs administration has handled the issue of 
ground troops with restraint it has praised countries for even 
modest naval contributions and made no specific public requests for 
allied infantry units 
but secretary of state james a baker iii during a senate 
hearing wednesday conveyed growing impatience 
wed like to frankly see perhaps a few more ground troops in 
there he said i think that theres a good chance that there 
will be additional ground and air forces 
his comments followed blunt remarks from several senators 
including democrat john f kerry of massachusetts kerry recently 
visited us troops in saudi arabia and told baker he was upset by 
what he found 
i didnt notice any of our other allies and that disturbs 
me kerry said it is one thing to be in the persian gulf on a 
ship somewhat removed from the first line and another to be up 
there in the desert bearing that heat and the immediate risk 
harsher commentary came thursday in an editorial in the new york 
times 
the arguments some europeans and japanese make for vacillating 
are almost as repellent as the vacillation said the editorial 
depicting such allies as sideline soldiers or deadbeats eager 
for us to protect their oil with our blood 
the saudi government has been tightlipped about details of its 
requests for western military aid 
diplomats say these requests are based on the kingdoms specific 
needs and on past military dealings with individual countries for 
example britain and france were involved previously with saudi air 
defense and thus were asked to help in that field 
britain sent aircraft rather than ground troops because this 
is what the saudis asked us for and this is all by invitation a 
british defense ministry spokesman said they operate the same 
type of tornado fighters as we do and therefore have the ground 
force facilities for those 
britain has sent four warships to the persian gulf one squadron 
of tornados to saudi arabia and one to bahrain a jaguar squadron 
to oman and a surfacetoair missile unit to bahrain its total 
force of just over 2000 military personnel is the only significant 
western deployment aside from the united states and france 
several western countries among them denmark and norway say 
they might contribute ground troops to a un peacekeeping force 
but not a uscommanded force 
baker told congress the united states does not want to put the 
military effort under un command

the phrasing of a question and answer in a sex 
knowledge survey released wednesday by the kinsey institute and 
reported by the associated press may have been misleading 
the truefalse question stated there are overthecounter 
spermicides people can buy at the drugstore that will kill the aids 
virus the correct answer given was true 
that does not mean the spermicides will cure aids the kinsey 
report says instead many health care professionals say using the 
spermicides along with a condom may help protect against 
transmission of the aids virus during sexual intercourse the

treasury secretary nicholas brady is declaring 
his global fundraising effort a success even though he received no 
specific pledges of new assistance 
bradys delegation returned to washington on friday night 
following an 18500mile journey that saw him hold hurried 
consultations with world leaders in paris london seoul south 
korea and tokyo 
in addition to bradys mission secretary of state james a 
baker iii made a whirlwind tour seeking support from the oilrich 
countries of the middle east 
the united states is trying to raise more than 25 billion to 
defray the costs of the american military buildup in the persian 
gulf and provide emergency assistance to egypt jordan and turkey 
three countries which have been hard hit by the trade embargo 
against iraq 
in each of the capitals brady visited he delivered the same 
message and received virtually the same response 
brady was thanked for coming forward with a plan for 
coordinating assistance and was politely told the country in 
question would have to study the proposal further before making any 
additional commitments of aid 
brady insisted he was not daunted by the lack of specifics 
because he believed the delegation had made a convincing case at 
each stop he said the cost of failing to protect the middle 
eastern oil fields was far higher than the sums being sought in the 
us aid package 
our principal message throughout this trip has been that there 
is a cost which all must share in maintaining a freely flowing 
source of oil brady said 
he said that for japan alone a 10 jump in oil prices represents 
almost 20 billion in higher fuel bills 
for south korea the annual cost in higher fuel bills was 
estimated at 25 billion 
brady said he used those figures in his meetings friday with 
south korean president roh taewoo and japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu 
both countries are heavily dependent on the flow of middle 
eastern oil 
oil which was selling for around 18 per barrel before the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait has been trading around 30 a barrel in 
recent days 
flying home from tokyo administration officials were upbeat 
about their chances of ultimate success although one conceded that 
full acceptance of the plan might take a little longer than we 
had hoped 
the administration officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said that tokyo was being asked to increase 
substantially its initial pledge of 1 billion 
the officials said the total amount being sought from japan was 
higher than 2 billion with one official saying the request was for 
billions of dollars although he refused to quantify the number 
any further 
one official said he wouldnt be surprised if we got very 
close to the figure being sought even though japanese officials 
during bradys visit had a lot of questions about how the economic 
assistance money would be distributed 
the administration had been expressing unhappiness privately 
about the amount japan has committed given the fact that the 
country has sent no troops to the persian gulf and has a vibrant 
economy which imports 70 percent of its oil from the troubled 
region 
for its part japan has announced it will contribute 1 billion 
to support the military forces in the gulf and has indicated it is 
willing to give humanitarian aid as well 
while kaifu made no specific commitment on additional funds 
us officials said they were satisfied that their proposal would 
get a serious review by his government 
one official conceded that the various reports of dissension 
over the details of the plan did not help that effort but he 
insisted the impact would be temporary 
its where you are a month or two from now that counts said 
the official on bradys plane who declined to be identified 
further he will understand billions of dollars in western 
support for the military and trade embargo

bulletproof backtoschool clothes are the 
latest thing for new york city children who run a dangerous 
gauntlet to and from class 
school blazers windbreakers and other jackets fitted with 
bulletresistant kevlar 129 pads are providing a feeling of 
security to parents undaunted by price tags ranging from 250 to 
600 
added shielding from flying bullets can be had from a 
bulletproof book bag or clipboard 
theyre offered by former new york city police officer stephen 
dandrilli whose security firm guardian group international 
corp is fielding inquiries about the jackets in new york and in 
similarly crimeplagued chicago and los angeles 
hairdresser john deloca 41 is a satisfied customer who 
recently bought 450 jackets for himself and his two sons age 8 
and 4 
god forbid if they should be caught in a crossfire or a random 
shooting then 450 would seem like a pretty good investment he 
said were talking about my childrens lives and the bottom line 
is you cant buy another kid 
guardian group has taken nearly three dozen backtoschool 
orders with hundreds of telephone inquiries promising more 
business dandrilli said 
demand comes after a rash of summertime child deaths in new 
york often by random gunfire four children were slain in an 
eightday period in august 
new york is on its way to a record number of homicides for the 
third straight year there were 1905 homicides citywide in 1989 
kevlar is a synthetic material five times stronger than steel 
and relatively light it is used in police bulletproof vests and 
vehicle armor 
its composition is a closely guarded trade secret but recent 
technological advances made it 25 percent lighter and 40 percent 
thinner than before so it is less noticeable and more comfortable 
dandrilli admits no clothing is ever truly bulletproof but 
demonstrates that kevlar pads will stop slugs and can save lives 
see here said dandrilli pointing to a swatch of kevlar 
fabric showing dents from two uzi bullets you may get bruises 
from the impact some trauma such as broken ribs but the bullets 
wont pierce the body he said 
in his office dandrilli has a row of fashion dummies sporting 
jackets vests and tshirts with panels of kevlar concealed in 
pouches joining the backtoschool lineup are kevlarlined fur 
coats and business suits briefcases and umbrellas 
the line of fur and leather coats starts at about 3000 and 
tops out with a russian sable coat for 80000 the bulletproof 
clipboard goes for 300 
an 8yearold boy named palmer in bow tie and redandwhite 
pinstriped shirt snapped on a denim jacket featuring kevlar 
silent armor and said it felt only slightly heavier than normal 
it feels good it feels like you have good protection and 
nobody even knows you have it on palmer said patting the hidden 
panels

sudan traditionally egypts closest friend 
has broken with its big brother to the north by refusing to 
denounce saddam hussein the junta is paying back favors to iraq 
and trying to avert explosive domestic problems 
but sudans strongman lt gen omar hassan elbashir is 
increasing his own isolation among arabs and within the 
international community by joining the small group of nations 
sympathizing with the iraqi president 
western experts say the policy is calculated to increase 
elbashirs popularity at home he wants to draw attention from 
sudans tottering economy by focusing on domestic sentiment against 
the usled international military presence in the persian gulf 
they said 
aside from sudan the only arab league members supporting or 
willing to put up with saddams aug 2 invasion of neighboring 
kuwait are jordan yemen tunisia algeria mauritania libya and 
the palestine liberation organization 
elbashir refused on aug 10 to join egypt and 11 other arab 
league members in condemning the invasion since then he has made 
trips and speeches denouncing the western military buildup in saudi 
arabia and calling for an arab solution to the occupation of kuwait 
on thursday elbashir told scholars and politicians in sudans 
capital khartoum that the buildup was meant to change the 
geopolitical situation in the area 
its already changed in sudan said a western diplomat in 
khartoum who follows that countrys military affairs closely in 
recent years he said by telephone iraq has become one of the 
sudan governments main sources of weapons to fight a 7yearold 
insurgency in the south 
sudan in northeastern africa is the continents largest 
country the size of the united states east of the mississippi 
river as elbashir drew the country away from its traditionally 
close ties with egypt and the united states after his coup on june 
30 1989 saddam filled the vacuum 
the diplomatic source said saddam last year sent elbashir 
sovietmade t54 and t55 tanks and artillery rockets this year a 
loan of iraqi transport planes ammunition and other military 
hardware prevented the sudanese rebels from capturing the southern 
capital juba the source said 
but he and other experts denied recurrent reports that iraq has 
based soldiers warplanes and scud surfacetosurface missiles in 
sudan since the gulf crisis began sudans government also has 
denied the reports 
other specialists on sudan agreed that keeping a newfound 
friend happy might have something to do with elbashirs position 
but they said more important is his desire to exploit the gulf 
crisis to gain popularity 
although iraq did them a favor the regimes primary concern 
is the domestic situation said peter woodward a lecturer at the 
university of redding in england they believe the antiwestern 
antiamerican sentiment can bring them local popularity 
so far elbashirs extreme martiallaw rule has gained him 
little popularity except from the small but wellorganized moslem 
fundamentalist national islamic front his harsh treatment of 
dissidents and summary execution of 28 officers after an alleged 
coup attempt last spring brought international outrage and 
intensified his isolation 
since the gulf crisis began thousands of sudanese have 
demonstrated in support of saddam and the sudanese strongman has 
visited baghdad several times trying to mediate a diplomatic 
solution

law enforcement agencies must spend more 
time and money fighting asian crime syndicates which are becoming 
one of the most powerful criminal forces in the united states the 
fbi director says 
asian organized crime groups traditionally choose victims in 
their own ethnic community fbi director william sessions told a 
gathering of business leaders friday 
now they are extending their tentacles out to the rest of 
american society he said 
indeed asian crime groups are networking and interacting not 
only with each other but with la cosa nostra and colombian drug 
cartels as well he said 
the fbi first became aware of the extent of asian organized 
crime when agents seized 900 pounds of 90 percent pure heroin worth 
more than 1 billion in february 1989 sessions said 
unfortunately asian criminal organizations are gaining larger 
and stronger footholds around the country session said 
japanese vietnamese and chinese organized crime groups are the 
strongest in the united states he said

japan and the soviet union view mikhail gorbachevs 
coming trip to tokyo as a sign frayed relations are on the mend 
but a territorial dispute over a group of small islands remains a 
roadblock to normalization 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on friday returned 
to moscow after three days of meetings in tokyo where he set an 
april date for the soviet president to visit japan 
it will be the first visit by a soviet leader to tokyo 
both sides noted a warming of longstrained relations during 
shevardnadzes visit and pledged to work toward closer ties 
in a joint statement released friday the countries said both 
sides must make efforts to make the visit to japan by the soviet 
president a major turning point in japanussr relations 
but it was unclear whether the countries were any closer to 
resolving a territorial dispute that has prevented the signing of a 
peace treaty to formally end hostilities after world war ii 
i could not find any practical change in the attitude of the 
soviet union on the territorial issue japanese foreign minister 
taro nakayama said friday after two days of talks with his soviet 
counterpart 
for years tokyo has insisted that the sparsely populated kuril 
islands off northern japan seized by the soviet union at the end of 
the war must be returned before there can be any real progress in 
economic or political ties 
the chain of islands were japanese territory from 1875 until 
after the war 
shevardnadze speaking at a news conference friday hinted that 
moscow was willing to talk and possibly make concessions 
on a bilateral basis we may introduce some change some 
further amendments but only in the spirit of negotiations and 
based on a rational dialogue shevardnadze said 
he also said the two countries were ready to discuss new 
principles with gorbachevs visit 
that appeared to echo comments attributed to gorbachev in recent 
weeks that he was willing to talk about anything in a summit with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
the soviet union has long sent conflicting signals on whether it 
was willing to negotiate the fate of the islands 
as recently as july gorbachev refused to discuss japans claim 
to the disputed islands saying the issue had been decided after 
world war ii and the soviet union abided by postwar arrangements 
some analysts say they expect the soviets to seek a resolution 
to the territorial issue to gain access to japanese economic aid 
and investment to help shore up the faltering soviet economy 
moscow has said it wants increased japanese economic 
cooperation particularly in remote siberia 
japanese newspapers today applauded the apparent soviet 
flexibility toward the territorial dispute but noted that 
resolution of the issue still seemed far away 
the englishlanguage japan times said in an editorial that 
shevardnadzes visit has produced a little brighter hope that 
japan and the soviet uion may manage to narrow differences over 
the islands 
the daily yomiuri said it agreed with shevardnadzes assessment 
that resolving the dispute would take a long time 
there is no need for impatience it said in an editorial 
on the other hand the promotion of improved relations should 
never be used as an excuse to put off the territorial issue 
the kuril islands were japanese territory from 1875 until 1945 
when they were awarded to the soviet union at the yalta conference 
of allied powers

was a decision for the judge

100000 fine for assaulting a member of congress 
the attack took place as studds was walking home alone from a 
dinner party 
the two youths according to their own admissions had been 
drinking in a bar near studds residence emerged from the bar and

the lawyer for an elderly california man 
accused of helping his wife commit suicide says he doubts a jury 
would convict him since he acted out of love 
bertram harper was ordered friday to stand trial on murder and 
conspiracy charges in the aug 19 death of his wife virginia in a 
motel room 
harper 72 could receive a life sentence 
harpers lawyer hugh davis said the murder charge wouldnt 
stand up because harpers help in securing a plastic bag over his 
wifes head lacked the key element of malice 
i dont think a jurys going to convict this man of 
anything davis said i dont believe an act of love is a 
crime this is a case of love and death and which shall prevail 
we believe love will 
mrs harper planned her suicide after learning she was 
terminally ill with breast and liver cancer her husband said 
the murder case against harper rests largely on his telling 
police he had put the bag over his wifes head and secured it 
around her neck after a nonlethal combination of pills and alcohol 
put her to sleep 
the official cause of death was asphyxiation the wayne county 
medical examiners office said 
district judge henry zaborowski ordered harper tried on one 
count of open murder which may be defined at trial as first or 
seconddegree murder or manslaughter and one count of conspiracy 
to commit murder 
under michigan law firstdegree murder is punished by mandatory 
life imprisonment seconddegree murder by up to life imprisonment 
and manslaughter by up to 15 years imprisonment 
harper told police they came to michigan from their home in 
loomis calif because they believed michigan had no law making it 
illegal to assist in a suicide under california law such an act 
is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison 
shanda mcgrew 40 mrs harpers daughter and harpers 
stepdaughter flew to michigan with them and was present at her 
mothers death she is an unindicted coconspirator in the case 
zaborowski let harper return to california under 25000 bond 
he probably will not have to return to michigan until his trial 
begins in late october or early november davis said

critics say a planned star wars test in the 
south pacific comes close to violating a 1972 treaty outlawing 
major missile defenses 
near the middle of the month a boeing 767 equipped with a 3ton 
infrared sensor will make its first attempt to track a mock warhead 
on an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from vandenberg air 
force base calif 
the plane is scheduled to depart boeing field in seattle on 
monday for a twoday trip to kwajalein atoll an army missile test 
range in the pacific 
antiballistic missile radar is prohibited by the 1972 abm 
treaty between the united states and the soviet union 
john pike head of space policy at the federation of american 
scientists and a star wars critic said the aircraft appears to 
be the functional equivalent of an abm radar 
pike said the soviets may be justified in questioning whether 
the airborne sensor is a treaty violation 
if we saw the russians doing this kind of thing we would be 
pretty bent out of shape about it and if the russians were giving 
the explanation we are we wouldnt believe them pike said 
the army says the airborne sensor is not a prototype for an 
antimissile sensor system it also argues that the aircraft could 
not substitute for an abm radar because of technical limitations in 
its infrared sensor and its onboard computers

a new administration broadside aimed at 
legalized abortion suggests prochoice advocates have much to fear 
from supreme court nominee david souter says the executive 
director of the national abortion rights action league 
in a supreme court brief filed friday solicitor general kenneth 
starr defended reagan administration regulations that prohibit 
governmentfinanced family planning clinics from providing abortion 
counseling the regulations promulgated by the department of health 
and human services in 1988 have been challenged by family planning 
clinics planned parenthood and other organizations 
the solicitor general said we continue to believe that roe 
vs wade was wrongly decided and should be overruled 
but he stopped short of asking the justices to do so in pending 
cases involving new york city family planning clinics 
this is direct evidence that there is reason to fear judge 
souter said kate michelman of naral the administration must 
feel confident they will soon have the votes to overturn roe 
the clinics are financed under a 200 millionayear program 
under title 10 of the public health service act the law forbids 
the clinics from performing abortions but earlier regulations had 
allowed counselors to advise women that terminating a pregnancy was 
an option 
the court is considering two cases from new york city in which 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the 1988 regulations 
on a 21 vote but some other federal appeals courts have ruled the 
regulations were unconstitutional

it would be based on the earlier tax

finns are taking a more active role in 
international politics now that they dont have to worry so much 
about upsetting the superpower next door 
this democratic freemarket society has always been cautious 
about swimming in the turbulent waters of international politics 
for fear it would be caught in the cold war battle but with the 
recent changes in the soviet union and with the soviets and the 
west getting along better the finns are getting their feet wet 
we are now driven to take stands on international issues it 
has been less so previously in the circumstances of the eastwest 
conflict said jaakko blomberg head of the political department 
of finlands foreign ministry 
president mauno koivisto whose nation plays host to the 
ussoviet summit this weekend gave a taste of things to come in 
an unusually strong criticism of iraq on national television 
manni manninen special counsel to the president said that we 
have chosen our policy to not get involved in issues over which the 
superpowers disagree themselves 
government officials activists and academics now say there is 
no longer the same basis for being quiet for decades successive 
social democraticdominated governments have repeated the canon 
that neutrality coupled with a security and cooperation agreement 
with the soviet union was in finlands best interest 
the policy was seldom debated in this country which shares an 
800mile border with the soviet union 
many finns on the street still believe that keeping a low 
international profile is the best policy for their country which 
fought from 1939 to 44 in order to remain independent 
but the changes in the soviet union and eastern europe have 
opened up whole new areas for discussion one of them is the 
possibility of finland joining the european community 
such a debate would not have taken place before lets be 
frank blomberg said 
for the first time in a long time a real substantial foreign 
policy debate is evolving said max jakobson finlands 
ambassador to the united nations from 196572 jakobson was the 
scandinavian governments candidate for un secretarygeneral in 
1971 but there was speculation abroad that the soviets blocked his 
appointment because of his rightwing leanings 
in earlier periods there was a sense of living under a certain 
threat and there was a strong consensus in finland that it was 
important to support the policy of neutrality said jakobson who 
is not a member of any party 
presidential counselor manninen said the finnish doctrine has 
been and still is that finland strives to keep herself outside 
superpower conflicts not to involve herself with issues in which 
the superpowers disagree between themselves 
now that the confrontation between the soviet union and the 
united states has more or less ended and is moving toward 
cooperation as manifested in the present gulf crisis this 
doctrine cannot any more be applied because the superpowers agree 
rather than disagree he said 
that doesnt automatically mean we are going to start chatting 
about everything shooting from the hip at everything that moves 
manninen said 
blomberg said of the persian gulf crisis you could imagine 
what the consequences would be if the soviet union and the united 
states had not seen it the same way 
we would in that situation seek a role that we traditionally 
serve that of peacekeepers he said thats what we do 
finland has contributed to every united nations peacekeeping 
operation and currently has more troops on un duty than any other 
country 
while the finns now have more options in reacting to 
international events they know that circumstances change 
our policy has always been and will always be that we are 
cautious said manninen we cannot change our geography so we 
will always be neighbors with the soviet union and they will 
always be a great power 
neutrality is like an umbrella you carry with you in case it 
rains said jakobson you cannot throw it away when the sun 
shines

an islamic scholar has written a book he 
says will refute the satanic verses the novel that sent author 
salman rushdie into hiding to escape death at the hands of enraged 
moslems 
the new book is scheduled for release next april by penguin 
which also published the rushdie novel in 1988 setting off 
worldwide protests riots diplomatic standoffs and debates on 
freedom of expression 
the bombayborn rushdie now a naturalized british citizen has 
been in hiding since feb 14 1989 when irans late leader the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered moslems to execute rushdie for 
blasphemy 
rafiq zakaria a bombay moslem whose 70000word manuscript has 
been accepted by the londonbased penguin publishing company said 
his book is to expose the baselessness of whatever rushdie 
attributed to the prophet mohammed 
he described his book muhammad and the quran as a case 
for islam 
i believe that the evidence is so overwhelmingly against what 
rushdie has written that the best answer is to convict him 
intellectually and not physically zakaria said 
moslems worldwide objected to rushdie using the names of 
mohammeds wives for prostitutes in his novel and the implication 
that the prophet wrote the koran islams holy book instead of 
receiving it from god 
a week after khomeinis death edict bombay became the 
flashpoint of antirushdie protests that spread to other indian 
cities in the following days at least 19 people died in riots and 
clashes with police in india and neighboring pakistan 
india pakistan iran and several other countries banned the 
satanic verses later iran severed diplomatic ties with britain 
accusing the british government of supporting rushdie 
i have traced the campaign of calumny against islam right from 
the birth of the prophet and culminating in rushdies book said 
zakaria 
a senior editor of penguin books ltd in london said a paperback 
edition of muhammad and the quran will be published by april 
the editor said however the book was not planned as a reaction 
to the satanic verses 
it is an incredibly impressive study of the thinking of islam 
looking at western prejudices she said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
zakaria a 64yearold academician and author of seven previous 
books described his latest effort as maybe a reaction to the 
vituperative attacks and innuendos by rushdie and his 
predecessors 
i have tried to show how most of it is based on deeprooted 
prejudice first between moslems and jews and then between moslems 
and christians he said 
the author attributed the unfortunately large sales of 
rushdies book to khomeinis death threat but said he neither 
condemned the order nor upheld it because by doing so i take a 
pontifical position 
nobody can take a pontifical position in islam because the 
religion does not recognize priesthood and teaches that there is no 
intermediary between man and god he said

hundreds of people looked on as a man shot 
himself in the head and tumbled from the top of a 16story building 
after a standoff with police 
all he wanted was attention police chief mayer deroy said 
after the gunman committed suicide friday it ended in tragedy 
and were sorry about that 
paul fisher 30 shot himself after holding police at bay for 5 
hours with a rifle and a handgun from the rooftop of an apartment 
building near his home in the citys densely populated oakland 
section authorities said 
this is a suicide note i just wanted the police to kill me 
said a message that wtaetv reported was found on fishers body 
he said he was going to jump since we wouldnt assassinate 
him deroy said 
fisher who had a history of mental illness fired at least 12 
shots one at an unmarked police car and 11 randomly into the air 
authorities said no one was injured by those shots 
fisher climbed on the roof of moorehead towers before noon with 
the two guns and 50 rounds of ammunition in a duffel bag deroy 
said 
after telling police he wanted a few minutes alone he climbed 
to the roofs tallest parapet dangled his feet over a ledge and 
smoked a cigarette 
staring into space fisher put a 25caliber pistol to his head 
as deroy pleaded paul paul dont pull the trigger 
the impact of the gunshot hurtled fisher into the air as 
onlookers gasped and police and medics sped to the scene 
police said they could not immediately say why fisher committed 
suicide because he refused to be specific with negotiators 
pittsburghs three networkaffiliated television stations 
wtae wpxi and kdka filmed the scene but did not broadcast their 
videotape because of company policies against showing suicides 
in 1986 pennsylvania treasurer r budd dwyer killed himself at 
a news conference he called in harrisburg to discuss a federal 
indictment against him he put a gun in his mouth and pulled the 
trigger a scene that was broadcast by some pennsylvania television 
stations 
cnn headline news showed footage of fishers last moments 
the reason we did it is that we were covering the story when 
it first broke and we were continuing to tell the story said meg 
andre a supervising producer at headline news 
todays pittsburgh postgazette had a frontpage photograph of 
fisher tumbling from the highrise the pittsburgh press planned to 
run a photograph of fisher just after he shot himself on an inside 
page of todays newspaper said tom birdsong night city editor 
the associated press transmitted two photographs one showing 
fisher falling and the other showing him holding a rifle as he 
stood on the buildings edge

despite persistent problems us 
officers say mail is reaching most us troops in saudi arabia 
within eight days 
the officers say thats a considerable improvement over the 
average eight to 10 days of the last few weeks but they 
acknowledge smaller units still dont get mail regularly 
outgoing mail has been impeded by small problems such as stamps 
sticking together in the desert heat the officers said the us 
postal service said friday it was sending selfadhesive stamps that 
dont curl and stick together but overall the system is working 
smoothly officers said 
the military on friday lifted a 12ounce limit on packages sent 
to troops in saudi arabia saying there was now a sufficient postal 
system and airlift capability in place to handle a larger volume of 
mail 
air force maj michael whitaker commander of the main central 
command postal operation in saudi arabia said the military postal 
service agency would notify all post offices in the united states 
of the change 
over the past five weeks since the us began sending troops to 
saudi arabia many soldiers have complained of poor mail service 
marines in the most forward positions appear to have more problems 
than the army or air force 
theres always going to be some glitches no matter how good 
the system is said capt bradley j seibel 30 of edwardsburg 
mich 
his 129th postal company is handling six tons of incoming mail 
daily and the load is steadily increasing 
he said however that incoming mail is processed in 12 to 24 
hours 
on friday 10 clerks sorted mail at the base post office 
mailbags were stacked up but there was nothing to suggest a huge 
backlog 
for american civilians living in saudi arabia and other persian 
gulf arab states mail to and from the united states usually takes 
at least a week more commonly 10 days or more 
seibel said the typical military unit arriving in the kingdom 
doesnt get a whole lot of mail until theyve been here a couple 
of weeks 
he said the army is expanding mail deliveries and will soon 
augment his unit with a reserve company of clerks from athens ga 
marines and air force personnel distribute their own mail after 
picking it up at an airbase 
postal officers said the saudis were helping with mail 
processing and were considering a us request that they work on 
what would normally be their days off including friday the moslem 
sabbath 
all packages are opened by saudi customs officers who look for 
contraband including alcohol tobacco pornography and religious 
items such as crucifixes and the new testament 
under saudi law pornography includes any magazine with pictures 
of scantily clad women including mail order catalogues 
siebel said he knew of only one case of a soldier facing 
discipline for smuggling liquor after his wife sent a package 
containing two bottles of whiskey and one of vodka

the 165 americans who stepped off a plane 
from kuwait leaving behind possessions and lives have brought 
harrowing tales of life under iraqi occupation of the oilrich 
emirate 
us officials said the former detainees who arrived in the 
jordanian capital aboard a uschartered iraqi airways jet would 
probably be flown to charleston sc today 
it was the first usarranged flight from kuwait which was 
overrun by iraq on aug 2 most aboard were women and children but 
there were some arabamerican husbands and a few other men 
elena reyes of los angeles described the last five weeks in 
kuwait as terrifying 
i didnt know night and day when they would come and knock 
down my door she said 
reyes said she felt relieved but still worried you left part 
of your life back there 
another american woman patricia hammer originally from denver 
described her foiled desert escape a frantic housetohouse search 
for safety and the pain of leaving her children behind 
and mary willett 35 of chicago said of the situation in 
kuwait its a disaster 
the flight stopped over in baghdad where passengers obtained 
exit permits from iraqi authorities before leaving for amman 
on arrival the americans were taken to the airport hotel to 
wait for the flight home state department spokesman mark dillen 
put the number of americans on the flight at 165 and said there 
were a few other foreigners on board 
many in the group seemed overwhelmed by their experience eager 
to talk even if they did not give their full names 
maureen aldakheel of st louis asked what advice she would give 
president bush replied go for it do something people are 
tired of waiting for something to happen 
people are very tired of waiting every day hoping for news of 
some military strike said mrs aldakheel who lived in kuwait 
for 11 years and left her husband behind 
i dont want war but its inevitable said sandra williams 
who said she was from ohio but gave no city youre dealing with 
a madman 
the americans in the group were among the first airlifted from 
kuwait 
a handful of us citizens in kuwait were flown on an iraqi 
airways flight to baghdad last week escorted by civil rights 
leader jesse jackson most other foreign evacuees have had to cross 
the desert to baghdad to catch flights out 
mrs hammer described the fearfilled days that followed the 
invasion 
at first iraqi jets streaked over rooftops to frighten the 
population she said later patrols and roadblocks had people 
cowering behind locked doors 
people are now terrified hiding and they dont know what to 
do next she said 
after the invasion she joined a jeep caravan to try a run for 
it across open desert to saudi arabia 
iraqis shot at us and then our escorts abandoned us in the 
desert mrs hammer said then some bedouins saved our lives 
and got us back to kuwait 
her kuwaiti landlord brought food until word went out that arabs 
would be executed for helping foreigners she found another place 
to hide with other americans finally the flight was arranged 
this morning i dressed up in a black veil like an iranian 
shiite woman and made my way to the pickup point she said 
mrs hammer who spent eight years in kuwait had to leave 
behind her two children alia 14 and issa 9 she said she just 
divorced her kuwaiti husband and he refused to let them go 
now that its over i dont know what i will do i left 
everything i left my children my money she stopped how can 
i put those two in the same sentence 
her strength faded and tears softened her eye makeup i have 
nothing left nothing at all

s gorbachev in advance of their summit together sunday praised 
helsinkis past role as a meetingplace for peaceseekers at a 
time of crisis in the persian gulf bush said much is at stake 
and there is much the world stands to gain if we succeed 
the city of helsinki has often been a meeting place for 
nations seeking to advance the cause of peace my thanks to the 
people of finland first for hosting this meeting and for setting an 
example for all the world in your resolute commitment to liberty 
and independence bush said 
he thanked finland for its staunch support in the united 
nations security council for the economic straitjacket imposed upon 
iraq for its occupation of kuwait 
today at this time of challenge finland once again stands 
with the forces of peace said the president 
earlier bush said he had no plans to ask gorbachev to send 
ground forces to saudi arabia but expects talks on a wide array 
of cooperative arrangements when they meet sunday

from the soviet union and that an oil deal could well come up at 
these meetings 
i think its something that we can work closely with the 
soviet union he said 
the president also said he wants to visit us troops deployed 
in saudi arabia but not now 
eventually i want very much to do it but i may wait for a 
while until all our forces are there and things calm down and the 
troops get settled in bush said i very much want to do it 
but i have no schedule or plans no set plans 
bush also said he has no plans to ask for soviet ground forces 
to serve with us troops deployed in saudi arabia

technology that might immediately boost soviet oil production

finnish president mauno koivisto says 
the united nations economic sanctions against iraq are extremely 
effective and the west should refrain from any further military 
buildup in the persian gulf 
the finnish host of the ussoviet summit made the remarks in 
an interview published today in finlands leading daily newspaper 
helsingin sanomat 
in my view it seems that the sanctions are extremely 
effective koivisto said 
those who like to believe that they arent working are 
yearning in the direction of taking other quick action said 
koivisto referring to military action 
he said he objected to sending more military forces to the 
region its possible that they could cause more confusion and 
mixup than usefulness when small ships sail to and fro over 
there koivisto said 
koivisto was interviewed before he greeted bush the first to 
arrive for sundays sudden summit bush warmly praised finland for 
standing with the forces of peace in backing the un sanctions 
against iraq 
finland a security council member heads the un committee on 
sanctions against iraq 
koivisto said there should be no deal with iraq to secure the 
hostages release or anything else he reiterated finlands support 
for the un position that iraq must release all the hostages and 
withdraw from kuwait unconditionally 
one cannot always reconcile and one shouldnt always try to 
do so there is a time and place for reconciliation said 
koivisto who in the past week has taken an unusual step for a 
finnish president by speaking out strongly against iraqs policies

a federal judge has rejected a challenge from 
greenpeace usa and cleared the way for the army to ship chemical 
weapons from west germany for destruction at a remote outpost in 
the pacific 
greenpeace sought a temporary restraining order contending the 
move and incineration at johnston atoll posed an environmental and 
human threat 
the army already has begun moving the weapons from a storage 
site at clausen west germany to johnston atoll 800 miles 
southwest of honolulu 
government attorneys had said johnston atoll is the safest 
location for the weapons they said every precaution has been taken 
to ensure the safety of the shipment to the new johnston atoll 
chemical agent disposal system or jacads 
greenpeace attorney skip spaulding contended the army violated 
the national environmental policy act by not filing an 
environmental impact statement covering the movement of the weapons 
within west germany 
the army said it prepared such a statement on the ocean portion 
of the weapons journey to johnston that report was classified 
president bush had assured the west german government the 
weapons would be removed by the end of the year congress required 
all us chemical weapons be destroyed by 1997 
the disposal facility at johnston resembles a factory or power 
plant it covers several acres on the coral atoll that is barely 
large enough to accommodate its airport

a suspect in the slaying of five 
college students told police he knew who killed two of the victims 
and provided a name believed to be one of his multiple 
personalities a newspaper reported today 
the florida timesunion in jacksonville cited sources it did not 
identify in todays story about edward lewis humphrey 
according to another newspaper report humphreys statements to 
police may be challenged because prosecutors stretched the law to 
keep defense attorneys away from him after he was arrested aug 30 
in an attack on his grandmother 
humphrey 18 has not been charged in the slayings 
humphrey is one of eight suspects in the killings by a man 
police said preyed on petite brunettes one of four women slain was 
decapitated and three of the bodies were mutilated the victims 
included one man 
humphrey said he knew who killed the first two christina 
powell 17 and sonja larson 18 the jackonsville newspaper said 
the timesunion did not print the name humphrey used but during 
a bond hearing thursday a jail guard testified humphrey referred 
to himself as john and exhibited bizarre behavior 
humphreys lawyer public defender jr russo said he was 
unaware of any such statements by his client 
its news to me he told the associated press but russo 
noted that police had grilled his client without attorneys present 
they also questioned him before we were appointed to the 
case he said 
authorities have refused to discuss publicly what humphrey has 
said 
russo said he believes investigators and prosecutors manipulated 
the system to deny humphrey the benefit of a lawyer soon after his 
arrest 
a judge could rule inadmissible any evidence gathered that 
afternoon which could include vital statements about humphreys 
last week in gainesville he said 
despite an intense focus on humphrey a university of florida 
freshman investigators elsewhere in the southeast checked unsolved 
stabbing deaths of other young women for similarities 
police cautioned friday that they dont expect immediate results 
investigators provided no details about what they gathered in 
searches of humphreys gainesville apartment car and his 
grandmothers home in indialantic a coastal city about 180 miles 
southeast of gainesville 
we did not leave emptyhanded darnell said 
agents also obtained a personal search warrant for humphrey that 
could yield evidence on bodily fluids fingerprints and hair 
the timesunion reported investigators found pubic hairs 
resembling humphreys but said the hairs were not conclusive 
evidence 
new charges of aggravated assault were filed against humphrey as 
a result of a confrontation the night before the first two bodies 
were discovered 
students greg herskowitz and rob lipvak both 18 claim humphrey 
threatened them with a knife at the pi lambda phi fraternity house 
aug 25 
humphrey also faces charges in indian river county of armed 
burglary and attempted sexual battery two years ago 
police disclosed for the first time friday that manuel taboada 
the only man killed by the serial slayer was asleep in bed when he 
was slain 
he was apparently surprised by his attacker ms darnell 
said

a woman who apparently contracted 
aids during a tooth extraction says her dentists death from the 
disease will not stop her plans to file a lawsuit 
kimberly bergalis spoke out friday for the first time and 
pleaded for tighter controls on the health care industry 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta reported in 
july that the case marked the first time a health professional had 
passed aids to a patient 
i had a lot of crazy thoughts like maybe i was at the beach 
and i stepped on a hypodermic needle ms bergalis said you 
just go insane with thought 
the 22yearold woman from fort pierce said she plans to sue the 
estate of the dentist david j acer of stuart and her insurance 
company 
if i can protect other people from what happened to me then i 
have to do it ms bergalis said 
documents filed in state court in palm beach described her as 
being in the advanced stages of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome her wisdom teeth were pulled by acer in 1987 
acer died monday but his death was not made public by his 
family until friday 
investigators from the centers for disease control interviewed 
ms bergalis three times to determine where she contracted the 
disease 
when i was visited by the cdc we kept going over certain 
things she said i said what about the dentist because 
there was a rumor at the time that he had aids they said they were 
not investigating that i never heard from them again 
cdc officials in atlanta refused to comment citing 
confidentiality rules 
the family of acer 40 decided not to immediately disclose his 
death so relatives could privately grieve said lawyer deborah 
sawyer 
on tuesday the state health department released a letter dated 
aug 31 that acer wrote to former patients urging them to be tested 
for aids 
acer said in the letter that he had followed cdc safety 
guidelines including consulting his doctor before continuing his 
practice and wearing gloves and a mask while treating patients 
he said he doubted he was the source of ms bergalis infection 
i am a gentle man and i would never intentionally expose 
anyone to this disease he wrote 
the letter did not say how long acer practiced after being 
diagnosed with aids 
ms bergalis lawyer robert montgomery said he planned to sue 
acers estate and cigna dental health of florida on ms bergalis 
behalf he did not say when the lawsuit would be filed 
cigna referred ms bergalis to acer who treated about 370 
patients belonging to the dental plan 
ms bergalis said she was stunned when she was told in december 
1989 that she was hiv positive which meant she had been exposed to 
the virus the illness forced her to withdraw at the time from the 
university of florida 
her legal consultant cardiologist dr sanford kuvin said she 
had no known risk factors 
there werent any other areas of my life that could have 
exposed me to this as far as dating and friends ms bergalis 
said i was in shock i was in deep shock

mother teresa the frail and aging nobel 
peace prize winner gave up her retirement plans today when nuns 
from around the world reelected her to head their order a church 
official said 
if this is gods will i will serve in the capacity in the 
best way possible the 80yearold nun was quoted by monsignor 
francis gomes as saying he supervised the election 
the vatican gave its blessing and approval today to keeping 
mother teresa as head of the order she founded in the late 1940s 
in march pope john paul ii bowed to mother teresas wish to 
retire and accepted her resignation he had rejected her earlier 
requests to step aside even though she pleaded old age and ill 
health 
the ballots were cast by 103 delegates representing the 
missionaries of charity around the world the vote came after eight 
days of religious instruction reflection and devotions conducted 
behind the walls of the kennedy center a home for retarded women 
and children near calcuttas dum dum airport 
the nun known as the saint of the gutters for her work with 
the destitute and dying suffered a nearly fatal heart attack a 
year ago 
sister priscilla lewis spokeswoman for the order said mother 
teresas agreement to stay on was greeted with great joy and 
clapping 
gomes who announced the result after a threehour meeting said 
the nuns felt that with so much opening up in the western world 
and in the eastern europe they need someone who can face the 
challenges 
until the balloting outcome was announced mother teresa had not 
changed her mind about stepping down gomes said 
after the result was announced gomes walked to the centers 
front gate to give the news to a small group of reporters 
mother teresas reelection settles for the moment one of the 
biggest questions facing the missionaries of charity who besides 
mother teresa has the worldwide recognition coupled with the 
indefatigable determination and charisma to open the political and 
financial doors needed to accomplish their work 
at the height of the israeli siege of west beirut in 1982 she 
walked between the guns of the israeli army and the palestine 
liberation organization to rescue children trapped without food and 
medicine in a frontline hospital the shooting stopped until her 
rescue mission was completed 
pulling herself from her sickbed only a few months after 
suffering a heart attack in september 1989 mother teresa headed 
for moscow and eastern europe to open new missions 
her ministry to the poor and helpless began in earnest 43 years 
ago in the gutters of calcutta she gave up a comfortable teaching 
job at a roman catholic school to succor those whom no one else 
would touch 
rescuing dying people from the streets of the teeming 
metropolis mother teresa went on to found a series of homes in 
calcutta and eventually throughout the world for societys 
castaways 
today the missionaries of charity operate 430 homes in 95 
countries for lepers cripples abandoned babies and others with no 
place to turn the order has about 3000 nuns 
she was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1979 
mother teresa was born in skopje yugoslavia daughter of an 
albanian contractor

president bush created a friendly 
frenzy with an impromptu stop today in a finnish marketplace where 
he strolled out of his armored limousine and shook hands with the 
crowd 
bush the first to arrive for sundays superpower summit with 
mikhail gorbachev said he just wanted to say hello to a few 
people and then ive got to get to work 
as helicopters whirled above his motorcade the friendly finns 
shoved to get a better view of the 6foot2 american president 
some clambered atop chairs and stall tables 
the scene unfolded in a vegetable and fish market in front of 
the presidential palace where sundays summit with the soviet 
leader will unfold 
its great theyve come here said a teenage girl named 
sari balancing against her two school friends on a market bench 
preparations in the finnish capital have been frantic since last 
weekend when bush and gorbachev announced their snap summit to 
discuss the gulf crisis and other issues 
a royal danish orchestra concert got bumped from finlandia hall 
commandeered as an international press center for the 3000 
journalists covering the summit gorbachev and bush planned to hold 
a joint news conference there sunday evening 
streets were barricaded tram stops were shifted and shopkeepers 
moved in to cash in on the foreigners pouring in for the weekend 
including 750 american and soviet officials 
shops usually closed on sundays were given special special 
permission to open on the sabbath 
more than 20 large blue buses were parked across city streets to 
block traffic around the palace and act as cover said a 
security policeman paramilitary snipers perched on the rooftop 
across from the palace and scanned the waterfront with binoculars 
police blocked off the entire katajanokka peninsula a 
residential area where a prison and harbor facilities are located 
ferries to sweden were delayed because passengers would have to 
drive past the presidential palace while gorbachev was having 
dinner with president mauno koivisto 
tshirts with pictures of bush and gorbachev above the face of 
iraqi president saddam hussein were fetching 20 
above saddams picture were the words i love babies and 
cemicals sic underneath the two superpower leaders were the 
words peace of world in helsinki 
of course its great that the presidents are coming said 
merja a schoolgirl out watching the city get ready after all 
we here in the north are so cut off from the rest of the world that 
it will be good that we can be at the center of world attention for 
a short while 
businesses expect the journalists alone to spend about 2 million 
marks every day about 270 each during their speedy stay 
but matti kohva from the finnfacts institute said finns could 
make more than money 
above all finnish businessmen will benefit from the fact that 
helsinkis name will be seen abroad kohva said 
the summit participants will pay for their own expenses 
said foreign ministry spokesman petri tuominikula all we have 
to do is to cover the cost of the extra arrangements 
that he said could come to about 1 million 
the foreign ministry hired allblack limousines and allblack 
taxis to ferry visitors and police were called off vacation and 
weekend leave

india and sri lanka today intensified 
efforts to bring their citizens home from jordan but tens of 
thousands of asian and arab refugees from iraq and kuwait remained 
stranded 
a jordanian border official said 225000 egyptians were stranded 
in a huge camp just inside the iraqi border he said jordan was 
withholding permission for them to cross because of the 
overcrowding at refugees camps 
jordans meager resources are inadequate to provide food 
shelter and transportation for the 100000 refugees stranded in 
camps along its desert border the flood of evacuees began five 
weeks ago following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
an airlift operation for the indians got under way today as a 
planeload of refugees from amman jordan landed in dubai they 
were to be flown back to india aboard indian air force ilyushin 76 
transports 
indian air force planes have not been given permission to fly 
directly to amman but dubai is allowing them to use its 
international airport as a transit point to bombay the new 
operation will allow india to take refugees from amman at a much 
faster pace than over the past week 
in sri lanka officials are appealing for food donations for sri 
lankan refugees in jordan the food will be flown to amman on 
passenger jets that are now returning home empty after refugee 
airlifts a royal jordanian airline official in colombo said 
the 185seat airbus jets chartered by the international 
organization for migration have been arriving at a rate of one or 
two a day for the past week the airline official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
relief officials have warned of unsanitary conditions at the 
makeshift desert camps and on friday one said the refugee problem 
could turn into a disaster 
the government and aid workers have appealed for international 
help to feed and transport home the evacuees from iraq and kuwait 
many of whom left all their possessions and money behind they fled 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion and subsequent annexation of its 
oilrich neighbor 
but on friday a shipment of four tons of canned beef from the 
netherlands was sent to laboratories for testing after tons of 
cookies powdered milk and dates sent to hungry refugees were 
deemed unfit for human consumption 
the worthless food was only the latest problem confronting 
international aid workers trying to ease the misery of 45000 asian 
refugees packed into the shaalan i camp near the ruweishid border 
post 
the jordanian border official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the stranded egyptians are waiting under terrible 
conditions for permission to cross into jordan to continue their 
journey home 
but we cannot cope with such huge numbers before the asian 
evacuees already inside jordan waiting for transportation to their 
homes are shifted he said 
he said 18325 evacuees crossed through the border post on 
friday 
james n purcell director of the international organization for 
migration appealed for ships and aircraft to repatriate asians in 
hot and dirty camps before human suffering becomes a human 
tragedy 
fights have broken out at the shaalan i camp where refugees 
scramble and jostle under hot sun for a meager daily ration of a 
piece of bread a tomato and a cucumber provided by the government 
little outside aid has reached them 
red cross officials and others say some refugees have gone for 
up to three days with little water food or shelter 
most of the refugees at the shaalan i camp are bangladeshi 
pakistani indian and sri lankan men many of the women and 
children are being sent to refugee camps in amman 
at a tent hospital set up by the red crossred crescent dr 
khaled issa said 2000 people a day come in for treatment most 
suffer dehydration colds and other minor illnesses but in the 
harsh camp conditions minor ailments can rapidly become 
lifethreatening 
issa said those who are sick should drink five gallons of water 
a day much more than is available 
a fivemember delegation from the european parliament toured 
jordans camps and members said friday they were appalled by the 
conditions one said european nations should provide military 
transport planes to airlift the refugees home 
official estimates say more than 250000 foreigners mostly 
asians have crossed the desert border post at reweishid since the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait

a legislative task force has failed to reconcile 
fully the economic plans of president mikhail gorbachev with the 
more radical proposals of rival boris yeltsin a top official said 
today 
the task force on economic reform which was under orders to 
come up with an economic blueprint before mondays opening session 
of the national parliament agreed friday night on what it called a 
unified plan 
however anatoly lukyanov chairman of the national supreme 
soviet legislature said at a news conference that the task forces 
plan would leave some major points of disagreement for national and 
republic parliaments to tackle 
lukyanov did not specify the areas of disagreement but on 
tuesday gorbachev spokesman vitaly n ignatenko said they centered 
on the speed and sequence of the reforms and on pricesetting 
machinery 
yeltsin president of the russian federation had threatened 
that the russian republic would go ahead with radical economic 
reform on its own if gorbachev and national authorities continued 
to delay 
since russia is the largest soviet republic with half the 
countrys people and threequarters of its land the kremlin could 
hardly ignore yeltsins warning 
lukyanov said the national legislature will not act on the 
economic plans until it has been discussed in each of the 15 
republican parliaments 
russias supreme soviet is to debate its radical version 
starting monday and may adopt it tuesday 
the plan calls for transformation of the soviet union to an 
economic union with a single currency and one customs code but no 
central authority to levy taxes the russian republic would 
immediately legalize private ownership of land 
lukyanov also said 13 bills on economic reform have already been 
sent to parliamentary committees for review he said they including 
draft laws on protection of individual property and inventions 
pricing entrepreneurship banking use of foreign currency 
employment customs social security insurance foreign investment 
and support for invalids and other disadvantaged groups 
other bills on the supreme soviet agenda for the upcoming 
session include one guaranteeing freedom to emigrate and travel 
the united states has refused to grant the soviet union 
preferential trade treatment until this law is approved 
freedom of religion and a law on creation of public 
organizations and political parties also will be considered 
lukyanov said

sweden and norway evacuated their 
embassies in kuwait today but officially left them open in defiance 
of iraqi authorities swedish and norwegian officials said 
surrounded by iraqi troops norways embassy has been without 
water electricity and communications for nearly two weeks similar 
conditions prevail at the swedish mission 
norwegian foreign ministry spokesman bjoern blokhus said three 
norwegian diplomats two swedes and and local employees were en 
route to baghdad and expected to arrive sunday 
we received word through the danish foreign ministry that they 
had left blokhus said we feel reasonably certain that the 
trip will go well 
he said norway still does not accept the iraqi order to 
permanently close its mission sweden took the same position 
principally we maintain our right to keep our embassy in 
kuwait swedish foreign ministry spokesman ulf heineback told the 
stockholm newspaper dagens nyheter 
the diplomats were guaranteed safe passage to baghdad but their 
eventual departure from iraq would be the subject of future 
negotiations blokhus said he said the iraqis no longer consider 
the kuwait embassy staff as diplomats 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and then annexed the oilrich 
emirate claiming it as part of iraqi territory baghdad on aug 24 
ordered all missions in kuwait closed turning off utilities and 
surrounding embassies with troops 
the us embassy is among about 30 missions in kuwait that 
refused to close although the staff was reduced 
several nations including the soviet union japan and hungary 
withdrew their staffs earlier but maintained the embassies are 
not officially closed 
iraq has told diplomats accredited to kuwait that they have lost 
their diplomatic immunity baghdad has blocked personnel who left 
the us embassy in kuwait from returning home until the mission is 
closed 
there were about 21000 westerners in iraq and kuwait at the 
time of iraqs invasion including 3000 americans iraqi president 
saddam hussein has allowed some western women and children to leave 
over the last week

lt gov evelyn murphy issued executive orders to 
slash the state work force and cut state salaries as she defied 
gov michael s dukakis while he was out of town 
with dukakis leading a trade mission in germany murphy lived up 
to her promise to take command and try to balance the state deficit 
what i have put in motion today is what i have been talking 
about for some time nothing radical nothing irresponsible 
murphy said friday im an economist and a public servant not a 
revolutionary 
acting under provisions making her acting governor in dukakis 
absence murphy issued executive orders that would cut the state 
work force by an estimated 1000 jobs and cut salaries for some 
employees she acknowledged however that dukakis can undo her 
work when he returns friday 
dukakis had said he might cut his trip short if any action 
murphy took threatened to hurt the states stability but after 
murphy issued her orders dukakis spokesman stephen crawford said 
he saw no reason for the governor to return early 
he noted that executive orders requiring payroll cuts would not 
take effect before dukakis comes back since such actions take 10 
days to implement 
in her announcement friday murphy also requested state agencies 
to cut their 1992 budgets 10 percent below spending levels for the 
current fiscal year and unveiled plans to set up a commission to 
investigate inaccurate revenue estimates which have been blamed 
for exacerbating the budget problems 
murphy who is running for governor in the sept 18 democratic 
primary touched off a power struggle in the statehouse after she 
said wednesday that she was waiting for dukakis to leave so she 
could enact her plans to deal with the states fiscal crunch 
learning about the revolt dukakis postponed his travel plans 
bitterly attacking murphys maneuver as a charade but he 
eventually left for germany on thursday night 
critics called murphys efforts a political stunt that 
ultimately would have about as much chance of success as her 
flagging campaign for governor opinion polls put her behind two 
other candidates for governor in the primary race 
i dont take coffee house coup detats very seriously said 
one of her democratic primary rivals boston university president 
john silber 
l edward lashman the governors secretary of administration 
and finance said that the projected savings in murphys plan were 
highly inflated though he called the proposal a serious effort 
along with many democrats murphy was an avid dukakis supporter 
during his 1988 bid for the presidency but the states fiscal woes 
have made dukakis the source of public disdain including snipes 
from murphy 
murphy insisted she was trying to save the state from sinking 
further in its fiscal mess 
as i look back maybe i should have acted in the past she 
said i dont deny that 
included in murphys executive orders 
cut the management positions under each cabinet secretary by 25 
percent by dec 31 
restructure the state department of administration and finance 
setting a goal of a 10 percent payroll reduction 
temporarily cut payrolls for state employees in the executive 
branch whose salaries exceed 40000 the salaries would be 
restored when the budget is balanced

ec economic and monetary affairs commissioner henning 
christophersen will give the finance ministers an initial

around 30 a barrel at that price the communitys economic growth 
could drop to 21 percent from a forecast rate of 31 percent and 
there would be a reversal in the trend toward declining 
unemployment according to ec figures 
another key topic of todays meeting was plans to turn the 
european community into an economic and monetary union an issue 
that has pitted britain against its ec partners 
in december the 12 ec nations will hold a conference to amend 
the communitys constitution creating a european central bank and 
a single currency 
while there is agreement on the need to turn the ec into a more 
effective trade bloc there are disagreements on the need for a 
single currency and central bank both of which britain opposes 
the finance ministers today discussed a blueprint for economic 
and monetary union that proposes a european central banking system 
called eurofed as early as jan 1 1993 and a european currency 
unit the ecu to become a single ec currency 
spain today proposed the ec not create a single currency until 
at least 2000 but use the currency along with the 12 national 
currencies for several years before the switch 
spanish finance minister carlos solchaga also recommended the ec 
not establish eurofed until after jan 1 1994

there are about 10 million members of families separated by the 
division of the peninsula in 1945 the border of north and south 
korea is sealed and there is no mail or other form of communication 
between the nations

korean president roh taewoo and his repeated reference to roh as 
your excellency president 
during the seoul talks kang said he proposed that south korea

voters in albania will be given some 
freedom of choice but the ruling communists will maintain tight 
control over the election process that countrys leader said 
in comments made available today communist party leader ramiz 
alia also hinted that wideranging changes may be necessary to 
accelerate new economic programs 
without combatting red tape without being freed from the old 
management complexes the hindrances we are coming across cannot 
be eliminated said alia in a speech thursday to legislators and 
senior officials of organizations supervised by the ruling 
communist party the state ata news agency distributed alias 
comments today 
albania in recent months has sought to usher in modest reforms 
and shed its image as a hermit country and europes last bastion of 
hardline stalinism 
diplomatic ties with the soviet union were reestablished 
albania is also seeking to resume full relations with the united 
states while moving closer to other european nations 
the albanian leadership has announced economic reforms 
calculated to nudge the country away from rigid central planning 
and give private farmers and tradesmen greater freedoms 
last month it liberalized travel regulations allowing all 
citizens to own a passport and abolishing the death penalty for 
those trying to flee the country authorities later allowed the 
departure of about 5000 asylumseekers who had poured into foreign 
embassies in the capital city of tirana 
alia however has said he will not allow sweeping democratic 
change and full multiparty elections 
outlining the planned election legislation alia said it would 
give all citizens the right to stand for office except those 
expressly deprived of this right by law he did not elaborate 
on who would be prohibited 
balloting would be secret and there would be two nominees for 
each precinct the right to nominate candidates would be granted to 
the party trade trade unions and other groups alia said 
but the party controls all public organizations in albania and 
it is unlikely the elections could pose a political threat to the 
current rulers 
alia said broadening the nominating base will represent and 
express better the will and convictions of all categories of the 
population

nasa was counting on a successful 
shuttle flight this month to help shake a tarnished image and prove 
to congress that it is indeed the cando agency of years past 
but the glory days seem further away than ever now that columbia 
still leaks hydrogen and remains earthbound for another week 
possibly longer its one more embarrassment for nasa as lawmakers 
head into the final weeks of budget talks 
president bush has proposed spending 151 billion for nasa for 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 thats 24 percent more than this 
years 123 billion budget 
the space agencys administrator former astronaut richard 
truly said he hopes and trusts congress will support the 
national aeronautics and space administration as it has before 
im going to continue to tell them what ive been telling 
them that is to remind them that were executing the program that 
we put into place after the challenger accident truly said we 
said that when we ran into safety problems like hydrogen leaks 
which can be extremely dangerous we were going to stop and fix 
them 
weve been sticking to our guns and doing what we agreed with 
their oversight to do truly said last week 
nasas third attempt to send columbia on an astronomy mission 
ended abruptly thursday when hydrogen leaked during fueling a fuel 
leak also occurred during columbias first launch attempt in may 
shuttle atlantis also was found to have hydrogen leaks that 
discovery prompted nasa in late june to temporarily ground the 
threeshuttle fleet 
forrest s mccartney director of kennedy space center said 
there is no reason for nasa to be hanging its head over the 
leakrelated launch delays 
hey this isnt easy work this is not the routine everyday 
work mccartney said the thing we want to do is make sure 
every time we fly we fly safely hopefully america will 
understand that 
one of the chief criticisms leveled against nasa after the 1986 
challenger disaster was that it was taking risks to meet an 
overambitious schedule that year nasa had scheduled 15 shuttle 
flights 
in the two years since flights have resumed 10 shuttles have 
been launched nine missions had been scheduled for 1990 three 
have flown 
discovery was the last shuttle to fly the april mission 
successfully placed the hubble space telescope in orbit but then 
a flaw in the instruments mirror was discovered in june 
nothing it seems has gone right for nasa since spring in 
addition to leaky shuttles and hubbles trouble the space agency 
has encountered mounting criticism of its space station plans and 
communications problems with the magellan spacecraft orbiting venus 
a senate appropriations committee will be taking all of nasas 
problems into account when it sets the 1991 budget deep cuts are 
expected 
the house already has slashed more than 800 million the 
houses 143 billion plan still is 17 percent more than the 
current budget 
about 195 million was cut from the 245 billion sought for the 
proposed space station freedom the house also cut more than 300 
million in work to begin on bushs plan to send astronauts back to 
the moon and on to mars 
nasa has more than enough on its plate at the moment and ought 
not to be starting new programs said rep william green rny 
vice chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee that funds 
nasa 
green said no one faults nasa for scrubbing launches because of 
leaking hydrogen a highly combustible fuel but he said the 
problem demonstrates how fragile the shuttle is and raises the 
question whether space station is way oversized in terms of the 
capability of the shuttle to get it built and serviced 
engineers suspect a bad fuel pump is the source of columbias 
latest leaks workers planned sunday to replace all three 
recirculation pumps one for each main engine 
nasa is aiming for a columbia launch for early the week of sept 
17 which would provide enough time before discoverys toppriority 
mission in october 
discoverys cargo is a satellite named ulysses that will be sent 
on a fiveyear journey to study the suns unexplored polar regions 
nasa must launch discovery between oct 5 and oct 23 or it will 
have to wait until the planets are properly aligned again in late 
1991

the ban on women serving as nurses 
will be lifted monday which would have been unthinkable in this 
strict moslem kingdom before saddam husseins army invaded 
neighboring kuwait a month ago 
the announcement last week was an indication of the social and 
political change that began after king fahd drastically altered 
saudi policy and invited hundreds of thousands of foreign soldiers 
mostly americans to defend his throne 
saudi diplomatic and other sources said the crisis will 
accelerate a discreet move toward liberalization that has been 
creeping through the kingdom for a decade 
some of the changes wrought by the us intervention may not 
last but saudi society appears on the threshold of modernization 
the crisis will have a lot of impact said prince abdallah 
bin faisal head of one of the countrys major industrial 
developments and a nephew of the king it will speed up certain 
ideas that the government has been thinking about for years 
expected changes include a more professional broadly based 
military more freedom for women greater press freedom more 
public say in local matters and a foreign policy of cementing 
alliances 
fear of a backlash from the conservative islamic faithful will 
temper the pace 
theres a feeling that society is still raw said omar s 
bagour an economics professor at king abdul aziz university new 
ideas should be delivered in specific doses so as not to offend the 
religious people 
american servicemen and women pouring into saudi arabia are not 
expected to have much direct influence on saudi society because 
most are stationed at desert bases it is the first time foreigners 
have been called in to defend the kingdom 
in addition a call for army volunteers represents a major 
change in a force that had been reserved for princes and members of 
the bedouin tribes loyal to the ruling alsaud family since the 
country was united in the 1920s 
they used to look for what was referred to as a friendship of 
arms bagour said now the doors been thrown wide open 
billions of dollars in oil money engendered a false sense of 
security in saudi arabia and the spartan desert warrior tradition 
gave way to limousines and air conditioning 
the saudi government has pampered its citizens for years 
given them everything for free said khaled a almaeena editor 
of arab news the kingdoms leading englishlanguage daily its 
time for people to start doing things for themselves 
a few weeks ago newspapers rarely carried anything that could 
rock the boat now they are becoming more open about arab issues 
in foreign policy the kingdom is moving conspicuously away from 
yasser arafat leader of the palestine liberation organization but 
diplomats said it was unlikely to abandon the palestinian cause 
saudi arabia and the other oilrich persian gulf states have 
paid arafats bills for years the saudis also have sought to 
balance their ties with america and the islamic world 
with the arab world turned upside down by saddam diplomats 
said the saudis are expected to foster ties with syria and egypt 
to rebuild a semblance of arab unity 
no one wanted to be quoted as speaking against the royal family 
a network of more than 4000 princes but businessmen are privately 
critical of the growing number of princes who use their influence 
to win government contracts 
king fahd is an absolute monarch like the neighboring emirates 
and sheikdoms saudi arabia has little democratic structure but 
that could be changing one option is a consultative council the 
government built a headquarters for it in the 1980s but did not 
name a council or hold elections 
because of the small population somewhere between 7 and 11 
million in an area the size of western europe policy changes could 
increase opportunities for women 
conscription for men has historically opened a place for women 
in jobs said faiza s ambah a journalist 
women have been banned from nursing for example because it 
involves mingling with male strangers a violation of islamic 
tenets 
most of the nurses are britons or filipinos said samar 
fatany a radio broadcaster what happens if theres a war and 
they all decide to go home in a recent interview the civil 
defense director said women probably would be asked to help 
ambulance and firefighting units 
before the crisis this would have been blasphemy one arab 
said 
many women hope for an end to laws against their driving or 
traveling without being escorted by a male relative 
the sight of american servicewomen driving trucks or working 
with their male colleagues in hightech jobs may bolster their 
argument 
to rely on a 22yearold girl to help defend the country could 
break a barrier in their minds said an ambassador from a moslem 
country 
saudis travel and study abroad have access to foreign 
television and radio and are host to 4 million expatriate workers 
among them 25000 americans but none of that has changed the 
kingdoms traditions or strict islamic principles 
most americans and europeans live in their own complexes so 
their customs considered decadent by many arabs do not infect the 
saudis 
conservative moslems who distrust the united states because of 
its close ties with israel supported the use of american troops to 
defend the country 
bin baz a spokesman for the religious groups issued a 
statement saying it was permissible to have christian soldiers 
defend the center of islam against an enemy like saddam 
even moderate believers say this support would evaporate if us 
forces attack moslem civilians in kuwait or iraq 
the united states will have our support as long as they act 
under moral rules said nezar zahed a lay preacher 
diplomats said the same rule applies to the saudi government 
which is keenly aware that change must be synchronized with the 
kingdoms islamic past 
just because we buy neon light doesnt mean we have to have a 
striptease with it as well prince abdullah said

a petition drive has put a proposed 
constitutional amendment on oregons nov 6 ballot that supporters 
and foes alike call the most farreaching school choice measure in 
the nation 
backers of the educational choice initiative or measure 11 say 
it would greatly broaden educational opportunity by giving parents 
the means to send their children to schools of their choice 
public or private 
opponents say it would severely weaken the public school system 
and violate constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
the proposal would allow parents to send their children across 
district lines to any public school state school aid would follow 
the students 
more controversially it also would grant state income tax 
credits of up to 2500 a year for pupils at private schools 
including churchsupported schools and for children taught at home 
a poll of 600 registered voters conducted in late august for the 
oregonian newspaper of portland found 48 percent in favor of the 
proposal 47 percent opposed and 5 percent undecided the margin of 
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points 
minnesota is the only state with statewide open enrollment for 
public schools it also is the only one that gives tax breaks to 
parents of students who attend private schools but the breaks 
arent so generous as in the oregon measure 
minnesota permits taxpayers to deduct from taxable income up to 
1000 in private school expenses the oregon measure would allow 
tax credits a direct subtraction from taxes owed of up to 
2500 a year 
the office of legislative counsel said measure 11 is similar in 
most respects to the minnesota law which was upheld by the us 
supreme court in 1984 
if the oregon measure is passed it will take effect in the 
199192 school year 
the proposal is certainly the most extensive one of its 
kind said sister catherine mcnamee president of the national 
catholic education association in washington the association 
which represents 200000 roman catholic educators strongly backs 
the proposal 
the idea for measure 11 however largely came from libertarian 
party adherents 
what were most concerned about is quality education for our 
children said steve buckstein a portland stockbroker where 
its performed is not as important as getting a good education 
buckstein an unsuccessful libertarian candidate for state 
treasurer in 1988 is a spokesman for oregonians for educational 
choice which put the measure on the ballot with 127000 petition 
signatures 
opponents say one of their major arguments against passage will 
be that the measure would result in using taxes to aid religion 
i have a basic disagreement with public funds for private 
schools said norma paulus the state school superintendentelect 
their arguments for allowing choice inside the public school 
system are very valid she said but if you lay the initiative 
on top of the existing funding mechanism it will hasten the 
disintegration of the public school system 
the oregon education association the states largest teachers 
union opposes the whole idea 
we believe every school should be excellent said the 
unions president karen famous competition implies winners and 
losers and none of our young children can be classified as 
losers 
the union also would focus its attack on the churchstate issue 
she said buckstein and other supporters say the churchstate 
argument is invalid 
the state will never write a check to a religious school under 
our measure buckstein said and there is no entanglement 
between the state and religion 
supporters compare the tax credits to federal collegeaid 
benefits that can be used at public or private schools 
a recurrent argument of the proposals supporters is that it 
would give low and middleincome parents who now have no options 
the opportunity to choose their childrens schooling 
only the wealthy now have a choice in oregon buckstein 
said right now geography is destiny where you can afford to 
live determines where your child can go to school 
a study of the minnesota system which until this year applied 
only to districts with more than 1000 students found less than 
half of 1 percent of students transferred under open enrollment 
last school year convenience was cited twice as often as academic 
opportunity by those who volunteered reasons on their applications

in the cozy arabesque precincts of the 
wahdat club a palestinian social center a dapper clerk spoke 
matteroffactly of the terrorism he expects to run rampant if 
america humiliates saddam hussein 
if these colonial troops remain in our region we will use any 
means to get them out kidnapping terrorism any means jamal 
abu saud said of the us forces in saudi arabia 
from former cabinet ministers and millionaires to teenagers who 
sweep up at the outdoor markets a majority of jordanians support 
the iraqi leader and his demand for a tie between kuwaits fate and 
a homeland for the palestinians 
if he fails a wide range of palestinians and other jordanians 
agree the united states will face deepseated anger radicalized 
political and religious feelings and possibly violence of jordans 
3 million people 65 percent are palestinians 
already some arabs in jordan refer to the united states as 
the head of the snake in the way iranians began calling it the 
great satan because it is seen as israels protector 
many palestinians say opinion crystallizing around saddam seems 
to have unified their community to a degree rarely seen 
i will explain said john hanna a retired banker sipping 
coffee under a rack of arabic lutes called rouds at the studio 
petra music shop his friend the shop owner nodded gravely 
as arabs and palestinians we lost our land hanna said 
we find this man who will give it back if he gives us back our 
rights we will worship him what else he does we dont care 
with a low chuckle he added that if king fahd of saudi arabia 
put everything behind a palestinian homeland we would worship 
him 
at his daughters plush residence palestinian business mogul 
issa masri parked his deluxe bmw beside his two other cars and took 
his guests upstairs there a roomful of intellectuals chimed in 
its time american presidents understood that they must make 
friends with people not with kings and sheiks said wadid masri 
an aging activist from nablus in the israelioccupied west bank 
saddam fought for eight years to keep iran out of arabia 
said wahid salah a palestinian lawyer and former jordanian foreign 
minister the streets of jordan are with saddam 
king hussein of jordan shows sympathy for saddam because his 
people demand it salah said just as palestinians insist yasser 
arafat orient the palestine liberation organization toward iraq 
salah stabbed a finger and added if saddam is defeated this 
whole area will be a zone of terrorism and anarchy every american 
in the arab world will be in danger 
dr wiin munib a medical professor who has lectured at johns 
hopkins university in baltimore and iowa university criticized 
washington for not hearing out king hussein 
i feel bitter about america maybe for the first time he 
said adding that his own feelings were more moderate than most 
on a less fashionable hill of amman among the winding alleys of 
the old souk or market the mood is easy to read 
at a butchers stall the familiar grinning portrait of saddam 
is taped up behind a hanging lamb carcass vegetable sellers and 
keymakers display posters of the king and saddam side by side 
hes right declared ahmed atthir 18 leaning on a counter 
of sunglasses and watches ill go fight if they need me 
wealthier merchants are in accord 
saddam is a great man said emile haddad the christian 
owner of a menswear shop 
in little towns the length of jordan at truck stops in the 
port city of aqaba on the red sea the word is the same 
complex feelings on the issue are not easy to judge salem 
fouad a cabbie keeps a photo of saddam on his windshield and in 
the glove compartment an invitation to his brothers wedding in 
nashville tenn 
opinion in jordan is shifting against the united states this is 
most evident in the 11 camps where palestinian refugees have waited 
since 1948 to go home 
the refugee camp of wahdat blends almost imperceptibly into the 
sprawl of downtown amman but its 120000 residents know every inch 
of its boundaries many refuse to leave even when they earn the 
means to move elsewhere for fear of losing their palestinian 
identity or their right to demand a homeland 
abdul aziz attar 70 was uprooted from ramallah in the 1948 
israeliarab war in 1967 when the israelis captured the west bank 
of the jordan river he fled to amman 
he sits among balls of yarn and sequins in his shop and dreams 
of a message like saddams 
you have to know the enemy is america because it gives 
everything to israel he said we live like beggars so they can 
have our wealth 
he drew a parallel with kuwait where he said a small group the 
nowdeposed ruling alsabah family squandered vast riches 
as he spoke a jordanian policeman leaned close to listen at 
the mention of the aug 2 invasion of kuwait he burst out that 
was saddams right it is his 
down the street a few blocks a mother bringing her five 
children home from shopping was asked about saddam 
we love him she said

to soviets and foreign residents of 
moscow helsinki seems like one giant shopping mall its filled 
with all the goods from canned tomatoes to fine clothes to 
videocassettes that are unavailable at home 
children at moscows angloamerican school asked once for the 
name of finlands capital answered stockmanns the name of 
helsinkis biggest department store 
catering to this image the finnish government said it would 
allow retailers to remain open sunday to accommodate the thousands 
of freespending foreigners in town for the summit between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
helsinki has long been a popular destination for shoppers from 
the east many of them expatriates living and working but finding 
little to buy in moscow 
for diplomats journalists businessmen and students in moscow 
helsinki has the closest hospital they would feel comfortable 
using the closest englishlanguage movie theaters the closest 
orthodontist and until this year the closest mcdonalds 
a cat owner in moscow says she is considering sending her pet to 
helsinki to be spayed 
finnairs halffare prices for threeday trips make the finnish 
capital a popular weekend destination for foreign families in 
moscow 
to get by other times they order lettuce cheese milk car 
parts furniture even all the fixings for a party from 
stockmanns the department store sends a goods train from helsinki 
to moscow every thursday 
for clothes some muscovites travel to helsinki to get the sizes 
right and a better choice of style and quality 
but stockmanns export service manager henry blomqvist said 
one gentleman came in here once to order bras for his wife his 
wife was in moscow and he was here so he took a look at one of our 
sales ladies and said you are the right size 
many western residents of moscow are asked to pick up a few 
items for their soviet friends the most frequent requests are for 
electronics goods car parts and videocassettes anything with 
western brand names or symbols beer brand tshirts sandals with 
foreign flag designs is gratefully received 
for soviet citizens who are able to save up precious foreign 
currency and lucky enough to be sent to helsinki on a business 
trip shopping in the west is an adventure 
a soviet sports team was buying ghettoblasters powerful 
portable radios at helsinkis trendy clockwork orange 
electronics store during the past week 
a soviet employee of an american firm in moscow was sent to 
helsinki to pick up a new company car the driver was astounded 
that different stores had different prices for the same items he 
had never heard of comparison shopping 
still casual soviet shoppers are uncommon in helsinki as 
reflected by sales signs in finnish swedish and english but 
not russian 
stockmanns glossy multicolored catalogues are sold in the 
soviet union even though the items shown are available there only 
in foreign currency stores the magazine is a widely read 
dreambook 
some soviets occasionally fulfill their dream and make their way 
to stockmanns export department in helsinki 
they are short of money blomqvist says thats the 
problem so they just buy the simplest things for normal use cheap 
clothes usually soviets were not previously big customers for us 
we have only one salesperson who knows russian well 
but more of them are coming every week he said

here are president bushs remarks 
saturday upon arriving for his summit meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the city of helsinki has often been a meeting place for nations 
seeking to advance the cause of peace my thanks to the people of 
finland first for hosting this meeting and for setting an example 
for all the world in your resolute commitment to liberty and 
independence 
when president gorbachev and i met in washington we discussed 
the possibility of meetings such as the ones well hold here 
tomorrow we agreed that the united states and the soviet union had 
reached a stage in our relations where meetings should occur more 
frequently less fanfare working meetings held as circumstances 
might dictate and our aim was that these meetings be unstructured 
and informal with an open agenda and a maximum opportunity to 
exchange views on issues of mutual importance 
in keeping with that aim here in helsinki president gorbachev 
and i will focus on a full range of issues 
we seek continued movement towards the new europe whole and 
free we seek to advance the pace of arms control strategic and 
conventional and i want to hear about the progress of the soviet 
reform and explore other issues of interest to our two countries 
and of course i expect that we will devote a large part of our 
time together to the situation in the persian gulf 
ive said many times this past year that we have entered a new 
era in world affairs this meeting comes at a critical time at a 
moment when the actions we take can shape this new world for years 
to come 
in the past many regional conflicts have played themselves out 
against the background of the larger conflict of the cold war 
renegade regimes and unpredictable rulers resorted to force 
counting on superpower stalemate to frustrate a united response 
international law and international organizations were often 
paralyzed powerless to prevent conflict or restore the peace but 
the international response to iraqs invasion proves how much has 
changed 
here in helsinki president gorbachev and i meet hopefully to 
strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable act of 
aggression much is at stake and there is much the world stands to 
gain if we succeed 
if the nations of the world acting together continue as they 
have been to isolate iraq and deny saddam the fruits of 
aggression we will set in place the cornerstone of an 
international order more peaceful stable and secure than any that 
we have known 
to our finnish hosts let met simply say that i intent to take 
full advantage of this very brief but welcome opportunity to renew 
americas warm friendship with finland i meet today with president 
koivisto whose counsel i have valued over the years barbara and i 
often talk about our visit here in the early 80s 1983 it was then 
that i first met your president president koivisto weve stayed 
in very close touch since then and i look forward to hearing his 
views on the many issues that ive just mentioned and others as 
well 
finland has long been a voice of peace and stability between 
nations in the councils of the csce as a member of the united 
nations peacekeeping forces and today at this time of challenge 
finland once again stands with the forces of peace i thank the 
government of finland for its staunch support as a member of the 
united nations security council upholding international law in the 
face of iraqs unwarranted aggression 
together with the nations of the world i am confident that we 
can reverse the dangerous course of events brought on by the 
actions of saddam hussein and restore peace stability and respect 
for the rule of law thank you mr president and may god bless 
the people of finland

the superpower summit in helsinki comes at a 
critical juncture in ussoviet nuclear arms control negotiations 
described by some analysts as stalled and possibly in danger of 
falling apart 
sundays session between president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev is not expected to provide more than a 
symbolic push for arms control the more immediate persian gulf 
crisis is at the top of the summit agenda 
the result may be a delay in the target date for completing a 
longrange nuclear weapons treaty at their washington summit in 
june bush and gorbachev pledged to finish the strategic arms 
reduction talks treaty already eight years in the making by the 
end of the year 
doubt also is growing that the superpowers will complete a 
separate treaty reducing conventional or nonnuclear arms in 
europe in time for a planned 35nation summit in paris in november 
bush has said he will not attend the summit unless a conventional 
forces in europe or cfe treaty is finished beforehand 
the europeans are particularly anxious to see a cfe treaty 
because it is closely linked to german reunification 
marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary said tuesday 
that bush and gorbachev will discuss cfe issues in helsinki but 
will not negotiate on the complex details 
they will be attempting to add the impetus that would ensure 
that agreement is ready to sign and that the summit can be held 
as planned in november he said 
the persian gulf crisis triggered by iraqs invasion and 
occupation of kuwait is more than a distraction for the arms 
control bureaucracies in moscow and washington it also has raised 
a new soviet security concern the sudden emergence of a huge us 
military force in the gulf area 
soviet gen vladimir lobov the military chief of the warsaw 
pact alliance was quoted by the soviet news agency tass as saying 
the american buildup in the gulf drastically changes the 
strategic balance in the region 
gorbachev is likely to seek reassurance from bush in helsinki 
that the us buildup will be reversed once the iraq crisis ends 
said steve lillyweber a defense specialist at the institute for 
defense and disarmament studies in brookline mass 
fitzwater insisted that start negotiations are on track but 
when asked whether bush still expects to sign a completed treaty 
this year he said only well were hopeful 
the start treaty would reduce each sides arsenal of longrange 
nuclear missiles by about 30 percent it would be the firstever 
negotiated cut in this category of arms 
i think it eventually will be finished but the timetable will 
slip maybe into next year said stan norris an arms control 
expert at the natural resources defense council a private research 
organization 
others say the treaty negotiations could unravel completely if 
bush and gorbachev allow the relatively few remaining disagreements 
to fester much longer 
spurgeon m keeny jr president of the private arms control 
association and an advocate of a start treaty said the rapid pace 
of developments in the middle east plus fear of other postcold 
war upheavals could kill support for the treaty 
a treaty is a little bit like a shark it has to keep moving 
forward or it dies he said 
three main issues are holding up completion of a start deal one 
is how far the soviets should be allowed to go in modernizing their 
ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles which form the backbone 
of the soviet nuclear arsenal 
the other unresolved matters are limits on the soviet backfire 
bomber and soviet efforts to set limits on us transfers of 
strategic nuclear systems to third countries

the pawtuxet river flowed red through 
coventry and west warwick last week 
no it wasnt blood red about 3000 pounds of a red powder dye 
was dumped accidentally into a chemical manufacturers sewage 
treatment plant wednesday friday that powder found its way into 
the pawtuxet river and turned the water bright red 
department of environmental management authorities said the 
hoechst celanese corp dye was watersoluble and nontoxic so it 
did not threaten the river or aquatic life 
although i understand it looks pretty horrible its 
essentially an innocuous spill said fran segerson a department 
spokeswoman 
the department has recommended that hoechst be fined for 
violating its discharge permit she said the size of the fine had 
not been determined 
the dye got into the river because workers failed to bleach 
waste water properly before it was released said carmen a avon 
environmental safety manager at the plant 
she said the company considered adding bleach to the river to 
clear up the color but state environmental officials decided said 
it would be better simply to let the dye dissipate on its own

iraq said today it will halt charter 
flights of foreigners to jordan because of congestion but a us 
official said the evacuation of foreigners would continue 
jordan denied crowding at its international airport was a 
problem 
iraqi government spokesman naji alhadithi said the order 
effective sunday would not stop any chartered flights today which 
were expected to include a planeload of americans from kuwait 
he also said regular iraqi airways flights to amman would not be 
affected and that charters to other destinations would be allowed 
state department officials said the latest group of americans 
was to be flown on todays chartered plane from kuwait to amman a 
us embassy spokesman in amman said about 150 people were aboard 
a similar flight friday carried 165 americans and a few other 
foreigners 
alhadithi speaking to reporters said the decision to stop 
charter flights to jordan was made after jordanian officials 
complained they could not handle the increased air traffic 
but a spokesman for the amman airport denied there was a problem 
with congestion at the capitals international airport 
everything is fine the airport is not crowded said 
mashhour elkurashi the foreigners arriving in the past week on 
iraqi airways charters to amman usually transfer immediately to 
other planes for the journey to their home countries 
alhadithi himself suggested another motivation for the cutoff 
when he noted that the shorthaul charters to amman paid for by 
the passengers governments were not particularly profitable 
we are ready to take them the planes to any other capital or 
city even to the farthest point the iraqi official said 
a state department spokesman told of the iraqi announcement on 
suspending charter flights to amman said the evacuation will 
continue the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
a chartered flight will leave baghdad on sunday for london 
we hope this will be the new model the spokesman said he 
gave no further details on that flight 
the iraqi announcement came just as the air highway out of iraq 
via jordan appeared to be running more smoothly exit visas were 
being issued more quickly than at the start of the week and iraq 
has allowed at least two direct charter flights from kuwait city to 
the jordanian capital of amman with stopovers for visa formalities 
in baghdad 
about a thousand stranded foreigners poured into amman by air 
from kuwait and iraq in the past week iraq had been allowing up to 
three charter flights a day from baghdad to jordan 
alhadithi the directorgeneral of the iraqi information 
ministry said airport officials in jordan had complained that they 
could not handle the hundreds of foreigners that have been pouring 
into amman for the past week 
since the exodus of foreign women and children from iraq and 
kuwait began sept 1 the amman airport has been the primary 
transit point 
hundreds of women and children were in baghdad awaiting exit 
visas or flights thousands more foreigners remain trapped in iraq 
and iraqioccupied kuwait stranded since the aug 2 invasion most 
of those in kuwait are in hiding 
on thursday iraq imposed a law mandating prison terms up to 
life for foreigners caught trying to leave the country without exit 
visas the law also requires foreigners to report any change of 
address within 48 hours or face jail 
on aug 24 iraq announced that anyone caught harboring a

a federal judge has rejected as 
frivolous the latest bid to block the execution of william 
andrews the nations longest standing death row inmate for the 
torturemurders of three people 
in a threepage opinion released friday us district judge 
david sam said andrews had been given every conceivable 
opportunity for judicial review in more than 15 years of appeals 
andrews 35 of jonesboro la was convicted of the slayings in 
1975 pierre dale selby who was convicted along with andrews was 
executed by lethal injection in 1987 
both were enlisted men at hill air force base at the time of the 
murders in which five people were tied up forced to drink liquid 
drain cleaner and shot in the head two of the victims survived 
andrews lawyers had filed a motion aug 13 asking sam to 
reconsider his earlier rejection of their motion for a new trial 
the petition by andrews who is black was based on claims that 
the prosecutions rejection of a black potential juror violated his 
constitutional right to equal protection under the law the defense 
also questioned whether sam had seen certain files from earlier 
court proceedings 
the judge said the arguments regarding the juror and other 
evidence purportedly uncovered from the sentencing phase of the 
trial appear frivolous 
and he said the records cited were pertinent only to earlier 
proceedings 
selby eventually confessed to firing the shots andrews lawyers 
have claimed he should have been convicted only of seconddegree 
murder because he did not fire the fatal bullets 
andrews principal lawyer robert m anderson was out of town 
friday and unavailable for comment he has indicated that the case 
would be appealed next to the 10th us circuit court of appeals

mother teresa saying she was bowing to 
gods will accepted reelection saturday as head of her worldwide 
mission for the poor after nuns ignored her wish to retire and 
voted for her to remain 
the vote was intended to choose a successor to mother teresa 
but after the results were announced the 80yearold nobel laureate 
withdrew her decision to step down as superior general of the 
missionaries of charity 
she hasnt changed her mind but she was elected said 
monsignor francis gomes who presided over the secret balloting 
she hoped that someone else would be elected 
gomes said mother teresa had little choice but to accept the 
unanimous vote 
in religious life there is no personal desire you have to 
accept gods will said gomes the vicar general of the calcutta 
diocese 
the vatican said in a statement that it approved and gave its 
blessing to the decision mother teresa declined to meet reporters 
pleading fatigue 
after the vote she told the nuns if this is gods will i 
will serve in the capacity in the best possible way said gomes 
last march pope john paul ii bowed to mother teresas desire to 
retire and accepted her resignation as head of the order she 
founded he had rejected her earlier requests to step down 
the yugoslaviaborn roman catholic nun known as the saint of 
the gutters for her work with the destitute and dying suffered a 
nearly fatal heart attack a year ago she returned to work but 
asked for retirement within a few months 
mother teresa was elected to a sixyear term the constitution 
of her order calls for a maximum two terms but the pope has waived 
this clause in the past so mother teresa could remain in the post 
ballots were cast by 103 delegates summoned from missions around 
the globe 
the election was held a year ahead of schedule because mother 
teresa wanted to step down 
gomes indicated that the sisters were swayed by the new 
democratization of eastern europe and the opportunities to open new 
missions 
the feeling was that with so much opening up in the western 
world and in eastern europe they need someone who can face the 
challenge he said he spoke to reporters in the garden of an 
institution for retarded women and children where the assembly was 
held 
mother teresas decision to retire had raised questions about 
the future of the missionaries of charity church officials have 
said nuns on her sixmember administrative council were capable but 
did not have her worldwide recognition determination and charisma 
which opened many of the financial and political doors needed to 
accomplish the work of the mission 
mother teresas ministry to the poor and helpless began in 
earnest 43 years ago in the gutters of calcutta she gave up a 
comfortable teaching job at a roman catholic school to care for 
those whom no one else would touch 
literally plucking dying people from the streets of the teeming 
metropolis mother teresa went on to found a series of homes in 
calcutta and eventually throughout the world for societys 
castaways 
at the height of the israeli siege of west beirut in 1982 she 
walked between the guns of the israeli army and the palestine 
liberation organization to rescue children trapped without food and 
medicine in a frontline hospital the shooting stopped until her 
rescue mission was completed 
today the missionaries of charity operates 430 homes in 95 
countries for lepers cripples destitute consumptives abandoned 
babies and others with no place to turn she was awarded the nobel 
peace prize in 1979 
after she was released from a hospital a few months after the 
heart attack mother teresa opened new houses in poland the soviet 
union czechoslovakia and yugoslavia where she was born the only 
east europe state without one of mother teresas houses is albania 
the homeland of her parents

differences on taxes and military spending 
before heading into the second straight day of negotiations

in new federal fees and 4 billion in defense cuts 
gop taxes included levies on alcohol a limit on state and local 
income tax deductions and a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
bush says the lower rate would raise money by encouraging people to 
sell real estate and other property 
the democratic plan called for 50 billion in savings next year 
and 500 billion over five years 
it relies on 269 billion in taxes and fees and 149 billion 
in defense reductions

president bush and mikhail gorbachev 
arrived today for their third summit a meeting bush said he hoped 
would strengthen our common approach to fighting iraqi 
aggression in the persian gulf 
if the nations of the world acting together continue as they 
have been to isolate iraq and deny saddam the fruits of aggression 
we will set in place the cornerstone of an international order more 
stable and secure than any we have known bush said at a red 
carpet arrival ceremony 
gorbachev arrived saturday night nearly eight hours after bush 
and declared the two leaders were meeting at a crucial moment in 
history to make sure positive trends in world relations are 
not thwarted by any developments 
the soviet leader said they would focus on the acute crisis in 
the persian gulf and a number of other issues 
in addition to the persian gulf crisis bush said he and 
gorbachev would discuss superpower arms control changes in europe 
and the soviet leaders economic reforms 
in brief remarks at the us embassy bush spoke of how 
fortunate it was to have the soviet union very much in accord 
with what were trying to do to stop iraqs aggression 
tomorrow well be speaking not to some adversary but to a 
leader of a country with whom i think we are going to have 
increasingly productive relations said bush 
the sun peeked through overcast skies as the presidents 
spanking new boeing 747 air force one touched down after an 
overnight flight from washington in town the signs of summitry 
were everywhere from the american soviet and finnish flags 
flying together to the extended hours that stores were staying open 
to cash in on the invasion of thousands of potential customers 
several thousand people were in the streets around the 
presidential palace waiting for a glimpse of the american 
presidents motorcade the usual tight security was in place 
vehicles blocking intersections and police sharpshooters 
overlooking the scene a helicopter hovered overhead 
this meeting comes at a critical time at a moment when the 
actions we take can shape this new world for years to come bush 
said 
in the past many regional conflicts have played themselves out 
against the background of the larger conflict of the cold war 
renegade regimes and unpredictable rulers resorted to force 
counting on superpower stalemate to frustrate a united response 
he said but the international response to iraqs invasion proves 
how much has changed 
even before the first handshake a soviet official raised the 
possibility the two leaders might decide to extend their talks into 
monday its unpredictable its up to them said the official 
who insisted on anonymity 
gorbachev has been supportive of bushs efforts to isolate iraq 
in response to saddam husseins august invasion of kuwait and even 
a joint summit statement reiterating a demand for an iraqi 
withdrawal would be a remarkable event marking the first time the 
onetime rivals have spoken jointly on a major international issue 
other than arms control in more than four decades 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze speaking friday on 
his way back to moscow from tokyo said he is ready if 
necessary to go to iraq to seek a peaceful resolution of the gulf 
crisis 
bush raised his hopes for a united ussoviet front against 
iraq out of the sunday summit 
here in helsinki president gorbachev and i meet hopefully to 
strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable act of 
aggression bush said 
iraqs aggression in the middle east overshadowed even the 
stubborn disagreements blocking completion of treaties to slash 
nuclear stockpiles and reduce troop and conventional arms in europe 
in the postcold war era officials said bush and gorbachev would 
devote part of their five hours of summit talks to those issues as 
well as to regional concerns such as afghanistan 
speaking to reporters accompanying him here aboard air force 
one bush said he would not ask gorbachev to contribute troops to 
the multinational force defending saudi arabia 
i have no plans to do that but i will be talking about a wide 
array of cooperative arrangements bush said 
bush said he was interested in trading us oil technology for 
oil from the soviet union the worlds largest producer and an oil 
deal could well come up at these meetings 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said earlier 
in the day that the soviet union would be willing to send military 
forces to the middle east under a military staff committee that 
included officers from the five permanent members of the un 
security council 
the talks came as both presidents coped with economic 
difficulties at home 
gorbachev is expected to announce a series of radical economic 
reforms when he returns home to moscow next week that could 
transfer power from the central government to authorities in the 15 
soviet republics 
bush left behind a weakening economy possibly sliding into 
recession 
administration officials said the summit would be an informal 
session for consultation and play down prospects for any major 
announcements or new initiatives bush proposed the meeting 
after their overnight flight from washington bush and his wife 
barbara went to the finnish presidential palace with finlands 
president mauno koivisto and his wife 
later en route to address american diplomats and their families 
at the us embassy in helsinki bush briefly stopped his motorcade 
at a crowded marketplace and briefly waded into the excited crowd 
shaking hands 
after speaking at the embassy bush moved on to his government 
guest quarters at the kalastajatorppa hotel 
secretary of state james a baker iii was arriving saturday from 
his tour of european and middle east capitals seeking financial 
support for the deployment of us troops in saudi arabia 
it is an unstructured agenda bush spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said of the summit the third that bush has held with 
gorbachev as president 
and despite the continued presence of soviet military advisers 
in iraq fitzwater went out of his way in a presummit briefing for 
reporters to praise the soviets for their real and very helpful 
support in the persian gulf and to say that 
for their part the soviets have said they were looking forward 
to sessions devoid of the theatrics of other superpower 
summits and reflecting the improved relationship in the postcold 
war era 
while the soviets have opposed saddams occupation of kuwait 
the summit gives bush an opportunity to respond to soviet 
misgivings about the us military buildup in the region gorbachev 
has voiced concern about unpredictable consequences of military 
confrontation 
moscow has been baghdads primary arms supplier and still has 
advisers in iraq gorbachev met with the iraqi foreign minister 
earlier in the week and bush may sound out gorbachev on the iraqi 
position 
the two leaders last met in washington in early june their 
first summit was at malta last december

he is also wanted in connection with the hijacking of a pan 
american world airways jet in karachi pakistan in september 1986

allied with the syrians which has about 40000 troops in lebanon

undisputed control over the sidon region and ordered his forces to 
eliminate abu nidal loyalists

in the rashadiyeh refugee camp near tyre about 50 miles south of

barbara bush strolled the narrow streets 
of this picturesque town an ancient viking haunt and said she was 
looking forward to seeing raisa gorbachev and chatting about their 
grandchildren 
mrs bush spent a chilly saturday afternoon in porvoo while her 
husband met with finnish president mauno koivisto in advance of 
sundays summit with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
in a bright cherry red suit mrs bush trod carefully over the 
cobblestones outside the 13th century lutheran cathedral where 
russian tsar alexander i declared in 1809 the autonomy of the grand 
duchy of finland then part of russia 
the white granite cathedral with red brick ornamental gables has 
survived centuries of plundering and fires first by the danes and 
later by the russians a soviet bomb fell on it during world war 
ii but caused little damage 
mrs bush shook hands with about half the 300 local residents 
gathered outside the churchyard hugged their babies and joked 
that she wanted to keep one of them 
the first lady walked along one of porvoos medieval shopping 
streets admiring the old wooden buildings painted in bright shades 
of mustard red and blue some displaying american flags in her 
honor 
in the local museum she examined antique needlepoints and 
lamented that needlework was a lost art among american children a 
display of jewelry crafted from human hair also caught her eye 
this city of 20000 people a historically important trading 
post 35 miles northeast of the capital helsinki has long attracted 
finnish painters and poets for its beauty 
it was also a favorite of the swedes when they controlled 
finland and swedish is still the mother tongue of nearly half its 
residents who call it borga 
the gorbachevs arrived late saturday afternoon for the summit 
mrs gorbachev and mrs bush are to have tea sunday morning and 
then view rare maps and books at the university of helsinki which 
is marking its 350th anniversary 
while relations between mrs gorbachev and former first lady 
nancy reagan were cool and sometimes testy mrs bush insisted 
saturday that she and her soviet counterpart are friends who have 
many common interests 
i think it helps the husbands relations if the wives are 
friends it softens the road a little bit she told reporters 
were both interested in our countries were interested in 
world peace she said on a very personal basis im interested 
in her grandchildren and shes interested in mine we have a lot to 
talk about 
the first lady urged support for world leaders trying to 
dislodge that dreadful man iraqi president saddam hussein 
from kuwait 
the persian gulf crisis sparked by iraqs invasion and 
annexation of kuwait has affected the lives of everyone in the 
world mrs bush said 
twentyfour countries have troops there but those who dont 
are also affected so this is a very important time we should be 
backing our leaders with every bit of strength we have she said

pope john paul ii has impressed people 
around the world with his knack for languages besides his native 
polish the pontiff speaks fluent italian and french and excels in 
german spanish and english 
now hes getting rave reviews for his swahili 
during his swing through tanzania the first stop in a 
fournation african tour ending monday in ivory coast john paul 
spoke mostly in english but he delighted the crowds by including 
long passages in swahili the lingua franca of east africa 
tanzanians said the popes accent pronunciation and delivery 
were impeccable even clearer than his english 
it was no accident vatican spokesman joaquin navarro explained 
that the pope prepares for all his trips abroad by listing to tapes 
of the local languages he began practicing swahili a month before 
this trip his seventh to the continent 
in burundi and rwanda former belgian protectorates in central 
africa the pope has spoken in french but also laced his homilies 
with brief expressions in kirundi and kinyarwanda 
sometimes the pope finds it difficult to hold the attention of 
his african flock since many are uneducated rural people who do 
not understand english or french 
for example during a ceremony in tabora tanzania the 50000 
stadium seats were filled when the pope arrived but once he 
launched into an englishlanguage homily a few thousand people 
mostly youths headed for the exits or milled around on the grass 
infield 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the popes foreign trips are planned to the last detail 
allowing little room for changes in the schedule but john paul is 
beginning to make a habit of paying impromptu visits to african 
villagers 
in january during a tour of the sahel region he stopped along 
a dirt road in guinea bissau and wandered into a hut to greet a man 
and his family the pope was so struck by the living conditions 
that he remarked freedom is compromised by poverty 
on thurdsday after celebrating mass in gitega burundi the 
pope visited with a family in a relatively comfortable house 
asking questions about the five children next in a much poorer 
area a mile away he stepped into a dark rudimentary hut and 
embraced a small child

john paul is not always the only show in town 
in dar es salaam tanzania about 100000 people showed up for 
his first mass and many others tuned in on radio 
but shortly after the pope rode off after the ceremony the 
citys attention and radio dials turned to another national 
religion soccer 
tanzania was playing gabon in a qualifying round match of the 
africa cup of nations at the national stadium for the record the 
game ended in a scoreless draw 
john paul an avid sportsman who played goalkeeper as a 
youngster in poland is not one to ignore the popularity of soccer 
in kigali on saturday he presented the john paul ii cup to 
the winners of a 12team national tournament held before his visit

the popes pilgrimage has taken him across one of africas most 
famous wildlife zones from the plains of serengeti in tanzania to 
the hills of rwanda home of rare mountain gorillas 
john paul has not taken time to visit any game parks but he 
received a stuffed lion as a gift from a masai warrior in moshi 
tanzanzia at the foot of mount kilimanjaro 
the pope does not want to offend local sensibilities by refusing 
gifts so the lion along with the wood sculptures fly wisks 
handicraft paintings and other more conventional offerings was 
taken to the airport for loading onto his plane but in the end 
the lion was left behind apparently because of lack of room

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said saturday it is time to slow the deployment of 
american forces to the middle east and to implement a rotation 
policy for troops already there 
at the same time the number of soldiers from arab nations 
helping defend saudi arabia should be increased said sen sam 
nunn dga 
there are already more than 100000 americans in saudi arabia 
he noted 
i think weve got deterrence there now and i believe the 
prime psychological and political benefit will come from getting 
more arab forces in there he said 
nunn talking with reporters at a convention of the georgia 
democratic party said he does not advocate a cap on the size of 
the american force but thinks a rotation system should be 
implemented to bring soldiers home 
i think its important that we understand those young men and 
women are going to get awfully bored and tired and gritty and dirty 
and hot and were going to have to have a rotation policy i think 
three to four months maybe five months but some set period of 
time 
they need to be told theyre going to rotate out of there 
it is important psychologically its important to keep the morale 
its also important if were going to demonstrate patience and 
tenacity 
nunn said he expected president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev meeting over the weekend in finland to 
discuss possible alternative action in the middle east in case the 
embargo of iraq fails 
there has got to be a discussion of options and how we act 
nunn said i certainly think we should not in any way be 
surprising the soviet union they have been enormously helpful 
here 
he added i think that bush needs to have a frank discussion 
of what we do down the road i also believe that if we do have to 
take military steps down the road it ought to be done as much as 
possible with other countries participating thats why i keep 
pushing for getting the egyptians in there with heavy forces 
getting the syrians in there with heavy forces

soldiers from fort bragg nc 
military officials said the saudi government which is trying to 
keep a wide distance between american troops and saudi citizens 
asked for the name change 
other us military outposts in the eastern desert have similiar

dragon is the corps emblem 
falcon forward base camp and eagle forward base camp are home to 
the 101st airborne air assault units they are also known as the 
screaming eagles 
the defense department has barred reporters from pinpointing 
locations of troops so the desert camps are always somewhere in 
saudi arabia

it looks like christmas gone mad 
plastic soldier targets lit like holiday lawn ornaments are 
under assault orange tracers slice through them like death rays 
bullets ricochet and flare with brief rosecolored intensity a 
bush catches fire illuminating the night 
the 265th quartermaster detachment a water purification unit of 
the south carolina national guard is practicing night fire 
another skill they needed for duty in the mideast 
some of the 14 men all from the environs of allendale sc 
are exhilarated by the sound and light show they have staged 
we are ready we are ready shouted don graham a 
construction supervisor as they drove back to the barracks through 
the sultry night some of the other men had already fallen asleep 
there was little enthusiasm earlier in the day as the 265th a 
collection of civilians that includes construction workers prison 
guards a truck driver and a college student spent a long hot and 
dusty afternoon on the range sweating swearing and firing at 
popup targets that sometimes failed to popup 
the day begins with an almost picnic quality the air is filled 
with dragonflies and vibrant orange and yellow butterflies that 
flitter and land on the flat black muzzles of the m16s 
there is even a picnic lunch of mres meals readytoeat

the package in the sun and you might want to think twice about 
putting the grape mix in your canteen

taste like that forever warns sgt earnest deloach 
but haute cuisine only goes so far the bucolic scene becomes 
oppressive as the day grows long and the temperature soars into the 
90s worst of all the unit must don hellishly hot chemical 
protective overclothes and the everpresent gas mask and try to 
knock down targets 
bullets fly wide and heads ache from the kevlar helmets you 
feel like the helmet has melted through your softened skull and 
imbedded itself in your brain

the other men stop to check out female personnel rooker wanders 
over to check out the tanks and armored personnel carriers 
he carries a large survival knife on his web gear and asks 
hopefully about getting an m203 grenade launcher for his rifle 
rooker wanted to join a national guard firefighters unit but 
his training school would have interfered with college so he took 
a less exciting option the 265th water purification unit 
it has turned out to be anything but boring

egyptian president hosni mubarak 
pledged more troops saturday to defend saudi arabia against an 
iraqi attack and registered doubt president saddam hussein could be 
stripped of his most dangerous weapons through diplomacy 
speaking to reporters after a 90minute private session with 
secretary of state james a baker iii at the opulent raseltin 
palace on the mediterranean the egyptian leader recommitted the 
largest arab nation to the usengineered drive to pressure saddam 
to reverse his aug 2 takeover of kuwait 
we are supporting the saudis as much as we can mubarak 
said referring to the 2000 egyptian troops now in saudi arabia 
and his drive to rally arab opposition to the iraqi leader 
having held further discussions with the saudis mubarak said 
we will send them the forces needed which is agreed upon we 
sent some forces now we are intending to send other forces in the 
very near future 
baker flew from egypt to helsinki to join president bush in 
talks sunday with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the main 
topic is the gulf crisis 
mubarak urged the two leaders to stand firm on the sanctions 
voted by the un security council 
i hope that gorbachev and bush have one line for dealing with 
this problem mubarak said this would be a hell of problem in 
this area if there are differences 
saddans invasion has swept away traditional egyptian and saudi 
reluctance to line up overtly with the united states their strong 
stand against iraq reinforced by a multibillion dollar saudi 
contribution has encouraged such arab states as morocco syria and 
the persian gulf emirates to participate in an antiiraqi coalition 
mubarak was rewarded this week by the bush administration with a 
promise to forgive 7 billion in debts to the united states for 
arms purchases 
let me simply state for the record how very appreciative and 
pleased the united states is with the outstanding and courageous 
leadership that you have demonstrated from the very beginning of 
this crisis in the persian gulf baker said 
asked by a reporter if there could be peace in the persian gulf 
so long as saddam had nuclear and chemical warmaking potential 
mubarak replied you know we are against chemical weapons 
against the presence of missiles because this is a very destructive 
means i think peace will never go with the presence of all these 
forms of weapons in the area 
the united states and its supporters in trying to harness 
saddam are relying primarily on an economic boycott the goal is 
to weaken the iraqi economy to the point saddam will withdraw his 
troops from kuwait and restore the monarchy 
but mubarak showed impatience 
asked how long sanctions should be employed before resorting to 
military action mubarak said it is a matter of estimation 
one or two or three months it may last only one month maybe two 
months but im telling you that doesnt mean its going to stay 
for one year 
bakers meeting with mubarak concluded a threeday trip to the 
middle east in which the secretary of state raised several billion 
dollars at the same time treasury secretary nicholas brady was 
asking for money in visits to world leaders in paris london 
seoul south korea and tokyo 
the united states is trying to raise more than 25 billion to 
defray the costs of the american military buildup in the persian 
gulf and provide emergency assistance to egypt jordan and turkey 
three countries which have been hard hit by the trade embargo 
against iraq 
officials traveling with brady said the united states hopes to 
get 35 billion to the three frontline countries before the 
end of 1990 with some funds arriving before the end of september 
to meet urgent needs such as refugee resettlement 
another 7 billion would be disbursed to those countries through 
the 12 months of 1991 
the remaining 15 billion or so would go to reimburse the united 
states for the 1 billionamonth cost of the persian gulf military 
buildup the officials said

for two years a small army of east german 
secret police kept an intimidating vigil outside the home of katja 
havemann a revolutionary long before there was a revolution 
ms havemann ultimately helped lead the protests that toppled 
the old government on saturday she kept her own vigil inside the 
former headquarters of the dreaded secret police demanding to see 
the records they kept on her 
she was among 22 people who on tuesday began occupying the 
building that houses the secret files that the stasi as the force 
was called maintained on 6 million germans 
the activists have vowed to remain until both german governments 
promise that the records will not be turned over to west germanys 
secret service when the two nations unite 
but the protest wasnt the only thing going on saturday at the 
giant complex of buildings where the communist regimes brutal 
security service kept the population in check 
on a cool cloudy day the headquarters of the feared stasi was 
a montage reflecting 40 years of oppression and one year of chaos 
a microcosm of the vanishing nations dark past troubled present 
and uncertain future 
a west berlin property speculator prowled the grounds looking 
at some of the vacant buildings he hoped to buy now and sell later 
i consider myself quite ethical said the developer who 
spoke on the condition he not be identified there is money to be 
made here but these people dont know how to do it 
as he drove away in a red mercedesbenz workers hauled building 
materials into one of the 30 buildings on the sprawling grounds 
the building has been used as an unemployment office for the 
last two months and workers were dropping off materials to 
renovate some of the rooms to accommodate the growing crush of job 
seekers 
more than 2 million of the nations 8 million workers are either 
unemployed or working shortened hours 
we probably see 1000 people a day now said horst nitsche 
who works as a receptionist and was overseeing the delivery 
saturday of the building materials 
in a parking lot across the street a small bazaar was set up by 
merchants hawking everything from smoked eel to sweat socks 
textile companies offered their unsold clothing farmers peddled 
wares that have been nudged off grocery store shelves by west 
german products and christian geissler displayed shoes made by his 
struggling company in the southern city of rosswein 
geissler who runs the factory of 450 workers said he and a 
small staff made the threehour drive to remind east berliners that 
the factory is still pumping out loafers and wingtips 
east germans have been buying goods from west german firms and 
geissler said his companys survival is in doubt 
next year will tell he said weve been lucky so far but 
survival now is the main thing 
nearby olaf ulaemst sold chinesemade radios jewelry and toys 
he bought the goods from an east german importer who can no longer 
get them into east german stores which now stock japanese and 
westernmade products 
in front of another building members of the new forum civic 
group that led the revolution passed out leaflets 
the group is not only demanding public access to the secret 
police files but the dismissal of the hundreds of former 
intelligence agents still working for the government 
ms havemann one of the people occupying the file archives 
came out briefly 
she was a prominent dissident for more than a decade before the 
peaceful revolt last autumn she said hundreds of police and stasi 
agents surrounded her and her husbands home during a 2year 
period when they were under house arrest 
we have to resolve this in a good way she said of the stasi 
files if we dont do it in a good way the old way will come 
back into the new germany

hunger and hardship grew today for stranded refugees in jordan 
as well as among diplomats and other foreigners holed up in kuwait 
whose iraqi occupiers faced further pressure from a ussoviet 
summit this weekend 
iraqi president saddam hussein told president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev to remember when they meet that iraq did 
not invade with its armies either of your countries 
i am not saying to youwhat your decision should be 
saddam said in a statement read by an announcer on iraqi 
television the comments were billed as an open message to the two 
leaders before they meet in helsinki finland 
egyptian president hosni mubarak also looked ahead to the sunday 
summit he said after meeting with secretary of state james a 
baker iii today that he hoped the united states and the soviet 
union could take a unified approach to the gulf crisis 
i hope that gorbachev and bush have one line for dealing with 
this problem mubarak said in english 
mubarak who has been reluctant to discuss the size of the 
egyptian force deployed in the gulf region said we intend to 
send other forces in the very near future he gave no details 
another freedom flight of americans was expected out of kuwait 
today a day after saddams government allowed 165 americans and 
some other foreigners to leave the latest flights in the weekold 
airlift 
iraq said today it would halt chartered flights to amman 
jordan beginning sunday because of jordanian complaints they are 
overwhelmed by the influx but a spokesman for ammans airport 
mashhour elkurashi said crowding at the airport was not a problem 
another possible motivation for the cutoff emerged when the 
iraqi spokesman naji alhadithi suggested that the shorthaul 
charters to amman were relatively unprofitable for iraqi airways 
the iraqi spokesman said regularly scheduled flights would 
continue to leave normally and the state department said charters 
to evacuate foreigners would continue as well with destinations 
other than amman 
five weeks after iraq invaded kuwait thousands of americans and 
other westerners remain trapped in the two countries many are held 
as human shields if war breaks out 
swedish and norwegian diplomats today evacuated their embassies 
in kuwait but said they defied saddams order to officially close 
them iraqi troops have surrounded the us and other compounds 
where diplomats running low on supplies have been drinking boiled 
swimming pool water and using furniture for firewood 
arriving today in helsinki bush told reporters he hoped the 
summit will strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable 
act of aggression 
in his arrival statement today gorbachev said the summit was 
necessary to ensure that international actions against iraq are 
not thwarted by any developments 
moscow said friday that it would be willing to provide troops 
for a un peacekeeping force in the persian gulf if they were 
under a joint command that included soviet generals 
financial support for the effort to counter saddams aug 2 
invasion of oilrich kuwait grew by the billions friday pledges 
came from japan south korea and kuwait whose exiled leaders 
promised 5 billion saudi arabia pledged several billion thursday 
in dhahran saudi arabia a us military spokesman said one 
pilot was hospitalized and a second escaped unhurt when a us army 
helicopter crashed during a night training mission 
the crash of the oh58 kiowa scout helicopter friday evening was 
the second in two days a marine corps ah1 cobra gunship tipped 
over after a hard landing 24 hours earlier slightly injuring both 
pilots 
about 100000 us troops are dug into the saudi desert south of 
the kuwaiti border at an estimated cost of 1 billion a month 
facing an estimated 260000 iraqi soldiers in and around kuwait 
scores of us and other warships in the persian gulf region are 
enforcing a unsanctioned embargo against the baghdad government 
us forces gained more momentum today when five amphibious 
landing craft passed through egypts suez canal toward the gulf 
region bringing the total number since monday to 12 
saddam who seized kuwait in a dispute over oil land and money 
has called on moslems to wage a holy war against the united states 
and its allies in the gulf crisis 
a jordanian border official said 225000 egyptian refugees were 
waiting to cross from iraq but that jordan was holding them back 
because it was overwhelmed by the 100000 refugees already stranded 
in its desert 
they are waiting under terrible conditions for permission to 
cross into jordan to continue their journey home the official 
said who cannot be identified under regulations 
but we cannot cope with such huge numbers before the asian 
evacuees already inside jordan waiting for transportation to their 
homes are shifted he added 
james n purcell director of the international organization for 
migration appealed urgently in jordan for ships and aircraft to 
repatriate the asians squatting in hot and dirty camps before 
human suffering becomes a human tragedy 
the united states said friday that it will dispatch 27000 tons 
of rice vegetable oil and wheat flour worth 12 million to the 
camps agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said in washington 
the food is to be shipped from ports by sept 30 a statement 
issued by the department said 
other countries have pledged millions of dollars in relief but 
distribution has been slow 
in kuwait a few foreign embassies including the us mission 
were still defying a 2weekold iraqi order to shut their doors 
but without power water telephone service or food the diplomats 
were being forced to retreat the embassies have tried to stay open 
in part to avoid the appearance of having accepted iraqs 
annexation of the emirate in part to try to provide protection to 
their citizens about 2200 americans remain in iraq and kuwait 
us officials estimate 
but there was less and less they could do to help americans 
arriving in the jordanian capital of amman on friday aboard a 
uschartered iraqi airways jet described desperate conditions 
until i felt my feet on freedom it was just terrifying 
said elena reyes of los angeles i didnt know night and day when 
they would come and knock down my door 
its terrible there said patricia hammer of denver 
people are frightened theyre in hiding running out of food 
state department spokesman mark dillen said us officials hoped 
another group of americans would leave kuwait for amman today and 
fly to charleston sc later during the weekend along with 
fridays 165 arrivals 
of the iraqi order to halt charter flights to amman starting 
sunday a state department spokesman said today the evacuation 
flights will continue the spokesman said a charter flight on 
sunday was to fly from baghdad to london which might be a new 
destination for the freedom flights 
dillen said iraqi authorities continued to round up american men 
and have nearly 90 in detention he said the latest addition to the 
list was an american man picked up thursday in kuwait with his 
nonamerican wife he was subsequently taken to baghdad 
kuwaits governmentinexile told baker in saudi arabia on 
friday that it would help bankroll the military effort a day 
earlier saudi arabia had pledged several billion dollars toward 
defraying the cost of the us deployment 
treasury secretary nicholas brady wrapping up a mission that 
took him to paris london seoul and tokyo said friday that japan 
and south korea gave new assurances of support for the campaign 
against iraq 
european community ministers in rome friday offered no money for 
the military effort though individual west european nations have 
committed ships to the gulf flotilla 
the ministers agreed to give 2 billion in economic aid to 
turkey jordan and egypt to compensate them for trade lost as a 
result of the un sanctions against iraq they also granted more 
food and other emergency aid for refugees

president bush on saturday raised the 
possibility of a unique superpower swap american stateoftheart 
oil technology for some of the soviet unions vast untapped crude 
resources 
i have no problem with that at all bush said en route to 
the finnish capital for his summit sunday with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the third highpowered meeting between the 
two leaders 
i would welcome the best in american knowhow on oil 
production drilling and seismic work going to the soviet union 
he told reporters aboard air force one i think it is something 
we can work closely on with the soviet union 
bush said he had mentioned the idea to the soviet leader and 
that they might discuss it further at their oneday summit which 
is expected to focus mostly on the persian gulf crisis 
such an exchange could serve the needs of both countries 
the united states with ample supplies of sophisticated 
petroleum technology is thirsty for oil even more so since the 
persian gulf crisis has shut off millions of barrels of crude to 
consuming nations 
but unlike west germany it doesnt have the cash to funnel into 
development projects badly needed by the kremlin to shore up its 
sagging economy 
the soviet union the worlds largest oil producer is desperate 
for the revenues which would flow from an upgraded petroleum 
industry 
its a good trade said allen sinai chief economist at the 
boston co they have the resources and we have the knowhow 
john lichtblau chairman of the petroleum industry research 
foundation in new york said its definitely a good idea 
theres nothing negative about it 
he also noted that any increase in oil production in the world 
would lower dependence on the middle east 
the suggestion comes at a time of a world oil crunch caused by 
the international embargo on 4 million barrels a day of iraqi and 
kuwaiti crude the economic sanctions were imposed by the united 
nations after iraq invaded and occupied its tiny oilrich neighbor 
on aug 2 
saudi arabia the worlds no 1 crude exporter and other 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries have 
agreed to pump as much as they can to make up the shortfall but 
analysts predict there still will be a gap on the market that could 
widen with colder weather in the coming months in the united states 
and other consuming nations 
however analysts said any deal worked out with the soviet 
union to bring more oil into the united states was unlikely to do 
much to alleviate possible shortages this year 
the soviet union produced 121 million barrels of oil a day last 
year which amounted to a sixth of the worlds total and more than 
the combined output of saudi arabia iraq and kuwait 
but analysts expect soviet output crimped by an outmoded 
system to tumble by about a half million barrels a day this year 
it exported 37 million barrels a day second only to saudi 
arabia with about half going to western buyers 
with oil prices soaring because of the gulf crisis moscow will 
likely earn a windfall this year of hundreds of millions of dollars 
every 1 a barrel increase could mean 1 billion a year in 
additional hard currency for the soviet economy according to 
analysts estimates in 1989 oil exports brought some 20 billion 
in hard currency into the soviet union accounting for about 40 
percent of the countrys hard currency earnings 
even before bushs suggestion the kremlin had begun eyeing 
western oil companies to help expand the countrys oil exploration 
and improve production facilities deteriorating from years of 
neglect 
the soviet union doesnt know how to bring oil out of the 
ground to refine it and ship it said sinai 
both chevron corp and texaco corp have reached preliminary 
agreement with the soviets on joint oil exploratory ventures 
american service companies also are participating in oil 
exploration with the soviets as is the french oil company elf

eight black men were shot 
stabbed or burned to death in a series of attacks around the 
country police said saturday 
police said four men were killed in soweto and two died in 
tokoza two townships outside johannesburg that have been hit hard 
by the black factional fighting that has claimed almost 600 lives 
since it began aug 12 
two men were killed in separate attacks in the eastern province 
of natal police said in the daily unrest report which covers 
incidents from the previous 24 hours 
most of the fighting in the johannesburg area has pitted zulu 
backers of the conservative inkatha movement against xhosas and 
other blacks loyal to the african national congress 
however there also apparently have been random attacks in 
recent days with no clear link to the factional fighting 
the anc and inkatha blame each other for the fighting the anc 
alleges police have sided with inkatha further fueling the 
violence 
government and police leaders have said individual officers may 
have acted improperly but that the police force as a whole has 
remained impartial 
both black groups oppose apartheid but they differ over tactics 
and plans for a future south africa 
the more militant anc waged a guerrilla campaign for 29 years 
before suspending operations last month the organization still 
supports sanctions strikes boycotts and other confrontational 
measures that inkatha does not endorse 
inkatha led by mangosuthu buthelezi and made up almost entirely 
of zulus favors capitalism in contrast to the socialistoriented 
anc 
the two sides have been fighting for supremacy since 1986 in the 
eastern province of natal and about 5000 people have been killed 
in the violence 
the anc has been leading the fight for an end to apartheid and 
president fw de klerks government has been holding preliminary 
talks with the group to clear the way for negotiations on ending 
whiteminority rule 
the antiapartheid democratic party said saturday it wants to 
join the government and the anc in future negotiations 
de klerk has said all opposition groups would be welcome for 
formal constitutional talks which he hopes to begin soon 
the democrats hold 33 of the 166 elected seats in the white 
chamber of parliament de klerks national party has 94 seats and 
the proapartheid conservative party has 39 seats 
the democrats are not expected to play a central role in any 
political settlement but the party is seen as a barometer of 
liberal white opinion and could form an alliance with another 
organization 
de klerk says he wants to replace the apartheid system of racial 
segregation with a constitution that would allow the 5 million 
whites and 30 million blacks to share power but he wants 
guarantees for whites under any further blackmajority government 
blacks now have no voice in national affairs

a task force on economic reform will let the 
national legislature resolve policy differences between political 
rivals mikhail s gorbachev and boris yeltsin a top official said 
saturday 
the soviet president and yeltsin president of the republic of 
russia had ordered the task force to come up with a single plan 
for the economy before mondays opening session of the national 
parliament 
their representatives decided late friday to leave key points of 
disagreement for the national and republic parliaments to resolve 
said anatoly lukyanov chairman of the national supreme soviet 
legislature 
lukyanov said the task force will present a unified plan with 
alternatives on several issues 
he refused to discuss the points of disagreement 
the news agency tass quoted russian prime minister ivan silaev 
as saying the national plan called for price increases and 
maintaining centralized control over the economy while the russian 
plan did not 
yeltsin has said that russia will go ahead with radical economic 
reform on its own if gorbachev and national authorities continue to 
delay since russia is the largest soviet republic with half the 
countrys people and threequarters of its land the kremlin had 
to take yeltsins warning seriously 
russias supreme soviet legislature is to debate its radical 
plan starting monday and may adopt it tuesday 
it calls for eliminating the kremlins authority to levy taxes 
among other changes russia would immediately legalize private 
ownership of land under the plan 
lukyanov speaking at a news conference saturday said the 
national legislature would not act on the task force proposal until 
it has been discussed in each of the 15 republics parliaments 
lukyanov also said 13 bills on economic reform have already been 
sent to parliamentary committees for review he said they include 
draft laws on protection of individual property and inventions 
pricing entrepreneurship banking use of foreign currency 
employment customs social security insurance foreign investment 
and support for invalids and other disadvantaged groups 
other bills on the supreme soviet agenda for the coming session 
include one that would guarantee freedom to emigrate and to travel 
the united states has refused to grant the soviet union 
preferential trade treatment until it enacts such a law 
legislation on freedom of religion and creation of public 
organizations and political parties also will be considered

just 10 miles from the us 
capitol but light years from its distractions and temptations 
bargainers at this years downtothewire budget talks have found 
a nice quiet home 
quiet that is if you dont mind the roar of an occasional air 
force f4d fighter or a squadron of helicopters taking off and 
landing the 6840acre base has 129 aircraft 28010 personnel and 
is home to air force one the presidents jet 
budget bargaining began friday at the base which was built in 
1943 and until now was best known for all those shots of presidents 
or other world leaders waving from the doorways of airplanes 
white house budget director richard darman and the chief 
democratic negotiator house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo selected andrews because reporters and lobbyists could be 
kept away from the bargainers 
in addition lawmakers in the bargaining room would not be 
tempted to leave because of a meeting with a constituent lunch 
with a lobbyist or the lure of a bank of television cameras 
because the negotiators want to fashion a budget deal by monday 
andrews offered another attraction free room and board so the 
talks could start early and go late 
rep silvio conte rmass one of the bargainers said each 
private dorm room had a kitchenette and he said with a smile was 
like a firstclass hotel 
but apparently not all of his colleagues saw the same luxury 
conte did of the 21 lawmakers and the two or three administration 
officials involved in the bargaining only seven of them stayed 
overnight friday an aide said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the negotiations are being held in what is normally the main bar 
and restaurant of the andrews officers club a sprawling 
singlestory brick and glass building reminiscent of a suburban 
high school 
next door are two singlestory bungalows done in tan stucco 
republicans are using the essex house as their conference area 
democrats have been assigned shelton manor in appearance neither 
one recalls the english countryside 
the officers club bar has large potted plants around its 
perimeter large speakers and a largescreen television and an 
orangebrown rug that one participant says give it the feel of a 
billiards room there is no builtin bar table

before the talks began friday morning reporters had their 
equipment inspected by the secret service and were then herded onto 
buses to be taken from the press center to the officers club 
about two miles away 
when they got there they were herded again into a ropedoff 
portion of the parking lot in front of the officers club 
gradually cars bearing house and senate members and their aides 
began pulling up and reporters beckoned to them to come to the 
microphones at one point sens pete domenici rnm and phil 
gramm rtexas obliged and answered questions 
one andrews public relations officer shook his head at the sight 
of reporters shouting one question after another at the lawmakers 
if these were generals id say thank you sirs he told 
a congressional aide referring to the remark press secretaries 
often make to end news conferences 
the congressional staff worker responded you dont do that to 
politicians 
</TEXT>

several minutes later gephardt answered some questions and 
disappeared into the officers club to await the arrival of 
president bush the president was not scheduled to speak and white 
house officials told congressional aides to disconnect and remove 
the microphones before his arrival 
the aides only had time to remove the public address system when 
the presidential motorcade pulled up unexpectedly bush bounded 
out of his limousine and marched right up to the microphones where 
he spoke briefly before entering the building 
with the public address system no longer working most of the 
reporters in the crowd had to compare notes with their colleagues 
who had been close enough to the president to hear what he actually 
said 
or presumably they had to read his lips

the budget talks began in may and got virtually nowhere by the 
time they broke off in early august for congress summer recess at 
the time jokes were heard about how the negotiators had discussed 
everything but the shape of the bargaining table a reference to a 
stumbling block during the paris peace talks on the vietnam war 
well the budget bargainers now have discussed the shape of the 
table and done something about it 
the bargaining table originally was laid out in a ushaped 
configuration but it didnt take long for people to realize that 
the acoustics in the large room made hearing difficult the 
solution the table was reconfigured into a square

a retailers charitable foundation will 
review the decision to end 22 years of donations to planned 
parenthood a decision that prompted some customers to destroy 
their credit cards in protest 
in august the dayton hudson foundation turned down planned 
parenthoods request for 20000 for familyplanning programs 
saying it hoped to distance itself from the abortion issue now 
that decision is being reviewed cynthia mayeda the foundations 
head said in a statement friday 
the move angered many dayton hudson corp customers who support 
abortion rights they cut up their credit cards and returned them 
to the company 
the company operates stores known as daytons or hudsons in 
seven midwestern states as well as target discount stores it also 
owns californiabased mervyns department stores and last spring 
announced the purchase of the chicagobased marshall field chain 
the foundation is a separate entity set up by the company to 
manage its charitable contributions 
ms mayeda said meetings with planned parenthood officials will 
be held in coming months we are confident that as we work 
together we will arrive at commonly sought mutually agreedupon 
solutions she said 
thomas webber executive director of planned parenthood of 
minnesota said he was delighted by the foundations decision to 
reconsider 
it is something we had hoped for but if you asked me a week 
ago to predict when i wouldnt have said today webber said 
it is swifter than we thought 
the foundations announcement came the same day that the twin 
cities chapter of the national organization for women rallied 
outside daytons minneapolis flagship store to call for a boycott 
of all dayton hudson stores 
the company has received letters and phone calls on both sides 
of the issue daytons spokeswoman ann barkelew said but she 
acknowledged that the larger number disagreed with the foundations 
action 
peggy lucas of the womens consortium of minnesota said her 
group which supports freedom of choice on abortion would continue 
to press the company to restore funds to planned parenthood but 
nancy koster vice president of minnesota citizens concerned for 
life said the foundations review of its decision will make a 
lot of prolife people unhappy and daytons will hear about it

pope john paul ii on saturday called for 
a narrowing of the gap between africas urban elite and rural poor 
and urged peasants in this infertile nation to redouble efforts to 
improve the quality of their lives 
later the military government announced a general amnesty to 
mark john pauls visit and said it will cover all prisoners except 
those sentenced for political crimes and corruption against the 
state 
the announcement broadcast on state radio said prisoners facing 
the death penalty will have their sentences commuted to life 
imprisonment life sentences will be reduced to 20 years and 
sentences of 10 to 20 years will be halved 
prisoners jailed for 10 years or less and all women and 
prisoners under the age of 18 will be freed the announcement said 
it was not immediately known how many prisoners will be affected 
in his speech john paul said rwandan peasants who comprise 
more than 80 percent of the population of 7 million have the right 
to demand the same health social and administrative facilities 
including credit banking as their urban counterparts 
it is necessary to avoid widening the inequalities between the 
town and the countryside he said 
the message in french was broadcast on state radio as john 
pauls motorcade traveled to the small agricultural center of 
kabgayi 40 miles southwest of the capital kigali thousands of 
peasants gathered in shaded banana groves near villages along the 
route to see him many held small radios to their ears 
john paul told listeners he believed the international community 
was dutybound to contribute to the development of the peasant 
world 
development projects must not deviate from their objectives or 
lose sight that they are for the peasants john paul said 
he said industrialized nations should pay a just price for 
primary produce from poor nations as well as provide humanitarian 
aid when conditions are worsened by famine drought or manmade 
calamity 
this year scores of people have died in a drought that hit 
remote southern rwanda 
on sunday john paul leaves kigali for the ivory coast the last 
stop on a 10day fournation african tour that has also taken him 
to burundi and tanzania 
a senior vatican official traveling with the pope welcomed the 
announcement of the amnesty 
maj gen juvenal habyarimana seized power in a bloodless coup 
in 1973 his government has been praised for its moderate 
prowestern policies but has cracked down on internal dissent 
john paul met with civil servants and academics saturday and 
commended the government for maintaining civil harmony and good 
relations between church and state 
later he repeated his warnings about the danger of aids in this 
nation at the heart of the socalled aids belt across central 
africa he blamed sexual permissiveness for the epidemic and urged 
selfcontrol 
fidelity and chastity which are part of christian marriage 
reinforce selfcontrol he told a gathering of 25000 young 
people at the amahoro stadium in kigali 
during his african visit john paul has visited aids sufferers 
but has reaffirmed the churchs opposition to the use of condoms to 
prevent the disease 
in africa aids is spread mainly through heterosexual contact 
as many as 40 percent of young urban adults in some areas of 
central africa may be infected with the aids virus according to 
official estimates

americans may be misled and endangered by 
scientists misconduct and conflicts of interest in federally 
funded medical research according to a congressional report to be 
released monday 
the report by the house government operations committee charges 
that federal health officials have few safeguards to discourage 
scientists from manipulating research on products in which they 
have a financial interest 
based on a threeyear investigation by the committees human 
resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee the report 
reviews 10 cases of alleged scientific misconduct at universities 
that receive public health service funds 
the report a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
over the weekend focuses on two parts of the public health 
service the national institutes of health and the alcohol drug 
abuse and mental health administration 
it charges that the universities conducted inadequate 
investigations of possible misconduct and retaliated against 
whistleblowers it also says nih officials usually accepted the 
findings of the university and ignored financial conflicts of 
interest among scientists who receive federal grants 
in one case at least 13 researchers who were evaluating a heart 
drug owned stock or held stock options in the company that 
developed it nih was funding research trials of the drug 
in all of these cases the ownership of the stock or options 
could have created a conflict of interest for individuals who 
received federal funds to study whether the drug was safe and 
effective the report said 
the reporting of misleading research results poses an obvious 
danger to the public the report said in addition the policy 
of some universities to make no announcements about their findings 
of misconduct is also a source of potential danger to the public 
because these scientists can resign quietly and move to another job 
where their work wont be monitored carefully 
the public health service which is part of the department of 
health and human services said in a statement that officials could 
not comment on the report because they had not seen it 
however the statement noted that officials have been drafting 
conflictofinterest guidelines it said officials wish to assure 
the public that any use of public funds for research will be done 
in a quality way 
currently most universities do not limit the amount of money 
their faculty may accept for research honoraria travel 
consulting fees or gifts from drug companies the report said 
also nih has no restrictions on conflicts of interest for 
outside researchers who get federal funds though it requires grant 
recipients to list all sources of funding for research projects 
when they apply for nih funds the report said nih officials also 
must approve outside financial arrangements that could pose a 
conflict for nih employees it said 
rep ted weiss dny subcommittee chairman said in comments 
included in the report that current public health service proposals 
to protect against conflict of interest would merely maintain the 
status quo 
lawmakers recommended adoption of regulations restricting 
honoraria consulting fees stocks equity and other conflicts of 
interest for scientists receiving federal health research they 
also recommend legislation to protect whistleblowers 
seven republicans on the committee faulted the factual 
accuracy of the report and said that while most of the cases had 
come under subcommittee scrutiny in hearings a few of the cases 
were investigated without the knowledge of republicans on the panel 
the republicans also disagreed with one of the committees 
recommendations saying that restricting outside financial ties 
could force qualified honest researchers to turn away from 
federally sponsored projects 
a better way to reduce incentives for manipulating research is 
through stringent enforcement of existing disclosure 
requirements they said

huge cartoons lampooning iraqi leader saddam 
hussein were removed from public view saturday in preparation for a 
historic visit by an iraqs foreign minister who was expected to 
ask iran to break the un economic embargo 
officials declined to comment on the visit sunday by tariq aziz 
he will be the first highranking iraqi visitor to iran since 1980 
when the iraniraq war broke out 
iraq is increasingly feeling the pinch of un economic 
sanctions imposed after it invaded kuwait on aug 2 since the 
embargo it has made concessions to iran including promising to 
withdraw from iranian territory seized in the last days of the war 
iraq also agreed to tehrans demand that the frontier between 
the two countries should run along the middle of the shatt alarab 
waterway iraq had long demanded that it have full control of the 
waterway 
aziz will return to iraq with his hands full if iraq 
continues its policy toward iran said an editorial in saturdays 
editions of tehrans jomhuri islami 
foreign observers speculated that aziz would bring concrete 
proposals for ending the territorial dispute that sparked the 
iraniraq war 
one western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
aziz probably would present a way to enforce a 1975 treaty that 
split the shattalarab waterway between iran and iraq 
such a plan would be vitally important because it would 
represent a de facto peace treaty between baghdad and tehran the 
diplomat said 
walls along roads leading to tehrans mehrabad airport have been 
covered with huge cartoons depicting saddam hussein as a war monger 
and a us stooge throwing bombs at iranian children but they were 
being painted over saturday 
where the walls could not be whitewashed painters who 
reportedly started work earlier in the week settled for smudging 
up the caricatures 
another indication that iran could be willing to negotiate with 
its former adversary was an editorial in saturdays keyhan 
international proclaiming that the american game plan in the 
gulf is at odds with world peace 
essentially the present iraqkuwait crisis is being exploited 
by washingtons regional ambitions in the name of the un it 
said 
an iranian newspaper close to president hashemi rafsanjani on 
thursday raised the question of sending food and medicine to iraq 
should the islamic republic help the iraqi moslem people in 
these hard times when they are facing an economic blockade asked 
the editorial in the englishlanguage tehran times 
since food and medicine are not included in the sanctions so 
far imposed on iraq by choosing to help the iraqi people iran will 
not be breaching any international law the editorial said

masked palestinian assailants gunned down an 
arab man and hacked to death an arab woman in weekend attacks on 
alleged collaborators in the occupied lands arab and israeli 
sources said saturday 
the violence underscored the inward turn taken lately by the 
nearly 34monthold palestinian rebellion against israeli rule 
most uprising victims since june have been arabs slain by arabs 
prior to that most were arabs killed by israeli soldiers during 
stonethrowing protests 
palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
masked activists abducted the woman identified as etas anims 45 
from her home in rafah in the gaza strip on friday night 
her body was found in a rafah street on saturday riddled with 
dagger and ax wounds an arm and leg had been hacked off the 
palestinian reports said 
graffiti scribbled on walls in rafah accused ms anims of 
collaborating with israel she had been beaten four times in the 
past by activists for similar accusations the palestinian reports 
said 
in the magazi refugee camp in gaza masked assailants ambushed 
fahmi mohammed sayed abu libda 34 on friday night and fatally 
shot him in the head the reports said 
abu libda also accused by uprising activists of collaborating 
with israel arrived dead at shifa hospital hospital officials 
said a military source confirmed abu libdas death and was 
checking the other report 
the deaths raised to 258 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs during the uprising against israeli rule of the west 
bank and gaza strip most have been accused of helping israel or of 
dealing in drugs or prostitution 
another 728 palestinians have been killed by israelis during the 
rebellion which began on dec 8 1987 fiftyone israelis and 
foreign tourists have been slain during the unrest 
palestinian violence against accused collaborators has risen 
dramatically in the last three months as activists have tried to 
eliminate informants suspected of sabotaging their rebellion 
the attacks have persisted despite calls by plo leaders to stop 
the slayings 
since june 42 alleged collaborators have been killed compared 
with 14 palestinians killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in the 
same period 
the decline in shooting deaths by israeli troops is largely a 
result of attempts to calm the atmosphere by pulling many soldiers 
out of trouble spots 
the army also has turned to other punitive measures to curb 
stoning attacks such as more curfews and closing more businesses 
on friday the military took the unusual step of closing eight 
stretches of west bank highway from one to two miles in length 
during the night to prevent stoning and firebomb attacks the 
national itim news agency reported 
soldiers also shut down a marketplace in gaza city on saturday 
after activists blocked a road with boulders and they closed a 
vegetable market in bethlehem following a stoning assault arab 
reports said

crises such as the one in the persian 
gulf should not be allowed to thwart better superpower ties soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev said saturday on arriving to meet 
president bush 
gorbachev planned to assure bush in their meetings on sunday 
that he will continue efforts to force iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
and to conclude conventional and nuclear arms control pacts by 
yearend said top us and soviet officials 
he was also seeking assurances from bush that the administration 
will press for senate ratification of a new trade pact with moscow 
and for other assistance to help the soviet union through its own 
time of economic and political crisis at home 
gorbachev has backed us initiatives in the un security 
council to condemn the iraqi invasion and approve military means to 
enforce sanctions against iraq 
but so far he has balked at sending soviet ground or naval 
forces to support the un effort in the gulf nor has he recalled 
193 soviet military experts on contract to train iraqi forces 
soviet spokesmen say the experts did not take part in the 
invasion but bush is almost certain to seek further clarification 
from gorbachev 
it remained to be seen whether gorbachev and bush agreed to the 
hastily called oneday summit in finland in order to announce some 
previously undisclosed deal concerning the persian gulf 
one soviet official said of gorbachev if the president has 
agreed to such an urgent meeting he must have something in his 
pocket the official who spoke on condition he not be further 
identified declined to indicate what sort of deal if any might 
be in the works 
gorbachevs presidential ilyushin62m touched down at the 
helsinki airport saturday night nearly eight hours after bush 
in his arrival statement he made clear the initiative for the 
meeting lay with the americans 
president george bush expressed a wish for us to meet at this 
crucial moment in history when it is important to compare 
political approaches and to cooperate and protect the positive 
trends that are developing in the world today and to make sure 
that they are not thwarted by any development he said 
it is important for us to meet personally although we have 
been in touch through various means including telephone calls 
and letters he said 
it is necessary to meet in order to discuss the acute crisis 
in the persian gulf and other issues he said in remarks that 
were translated at the arrival from russian into english but not 
into finnish 
gorbachev looked relaxed despite a host of domestic troubles 
that threaten the economy and structure of the soviet union 
as he flew toward helsinki radio moscow quoted parliamentary 
leaders saying that the nation might drop the word socialist from 
its formal name changing from the union of soviet socialist 
republics to the union of soviet sovereign republics 
the change would reflect declarations of independence or 
sovereignty by more than half of the 15 soviet republics including 
russia the largest 
a key gorbachev ally in moscow vice president anatoly lukyanov 
also said saturday that a prospective compromise on economic reform 
had fallen through with russian president boris yeltsin who 
advocates a more radical transition to a market economy 
faced with possible approval of yeltsins radical reform package 
by the parliament of the russian federation early next week 
gorbachev dropped plans to present his own version to the national 
parliament on monday or tuesday 
instead lukyanov told a news conference in moscow gorbachev 
will circulate his plans to the soviet republics before presenting 
it to the national legislature the announcement indicated that 
gorbachev was losing the domestic initiative to yeltsin

the soviet union may drop the word socialist 
from its formal name according to a top official quoted by radio 
moscow on saturday 
the union of soviet socialist republics or ussr might 
become the union of sovereign soviet republics the broadcast said 
quoting parliamentary leader rafik nishanov 
proposals to drop socialist indicate the depth of change in 
the country where less than six months ago the communist party 
held a constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power 
the use addition of the word sovereign would be aimed at 
placating republics seeking independence or more autonomy 
a second variation on the ussr initials calls for 
sovereign to replace soviet a term disliked by nationalist 
movements in some republics the full title of the nation could be 
union of sovereign socialist states the radio broadcast said 
nishanov said a name change might be approved as part of a new 
union treaty which is expected to redefine the country as 
something between a federation and an economic alliance action on 
the union treaty is expected before the end of the year 
democratic reforms have led to official name changes in other 
countries last year both hungary and poland dropped the word 
peoples from their names to become the republic of hungary and 
republic of poland 
in january czeckoslovakian president vaclav havel proposed 
dropping the word socialist from the countrys formal name

finance ministers of the 12 economic community 
nations agreed saturday that restrictive budget and monetary 
policies are the best way to react to the recent surge in world oil 
prices 
at a oneday meeting here they also agreed that governments 
should react according to the conditions in their own countries 
said italian treasury minister guido carli 
carli the meetings chairman said the ec countries should be 
able to prevent widespread inflation following the oil price surge 
by controlling consumer demand 
oil prices have soared nearly 50 percent to about 30 a barrel 
since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and the subsequent un 
trade embargo imposed on iraq the price rise occurred despite a 
decision by opec nations to raise production 
budget and monetary policies should be restrictive according

this north florida city regained the 
feel of a typical college town saturday as attention shifted from 
the killings of five college students to the football stadium 
reports surfaced that an 18yearold freshman who is a suspect 
in the case may have multiple personalities ranging from a 
knifewielding rambo type to a mixedup college kid 
an estimated 70000 fans crowded into ben hill griffin stadium 
for the opener for the university of florida gators who were 
playing the oklahoma state cowboys 
fear and tension were temporarily replaced by traditional 
tailgate parties boisterous fans and gridiron competition 
this football game was needed said william stebbins a 
florida alumnus from jacksonville who said he had missed only 
three home games since 1951 all the students need something to 
reduce the tension and stress 
but the search for a killer continued 
sources close to the investigation have told the florida 
timesunion that suspect edward lewis humphrey an 18yearold 
university of florida freshman has admitted having knowledge of 
the first two killings discovered two weeks ago 
humphrey in an interview with investigators last week named 
someone he said had killed christina powell 17 and sonja larson 
18 their bodies were discovered aug 26 in their gainesville 
townhouse 
investigators believe the person humphrey named is one of his 
multiple personalities the newspaper reported both his lawyer and 
police had no comment on the report 
a source familiar with the case said humphreys personality 
sometimes resembles that of a knifewielding killer and at other 
times a emotionally troubled college student 
humphrey takes the antidepressant drug lithium to control mood 
swings 
police have repeatedly said that humphrey being held in the 
brevard county jail in lieu of 1 million bond for allegedly 
beating his grandmother is one of eight suspects and they have 
refused to characterize him as the prime suspect 
at a hearing thursday in sharpes emily glaab a brevard county 
jail guard said humphrey sometimes referred to himself as john 
the guard quoted humphrey as saying john doesnt take no 
prisoners 
humphreys lawyer public defender jr russo said he was 
unaware of any such statements by his client 
its news to me russo said 
he noted however that police had grilled his client without 
attorneys present 
so far authorities have refused to discuss publicly what 
humphrey has told them 
we are not going to be able to speak to what information we 
have gained in interviews with suspects gainesville police lt 
sadie darnell said saturday we are still working around the 
clock and following up leads but as far was we can tell there 
will be no new developments this weekend 
police said late last week they had found promising evidence 
during searches of humphreys gainesville apartment his car and 
his grandmothers home in indialantic a coastal city about 180 
miles southeast of gainesville 
police also have continued to pursue other leads both in 
florida and elsewhere 
besides the brevard county charge humphrey has been charged in 
indian river county with armed burglary and attempted sexual 
battery and with aggravated assault in gainesville 
memories of the killings were likely to return after the game 
said joe fincher owner of the gator shop 
its just a football game he said the extra people who 
came into town will be gone tomorrow and nothing will have 
changed

efforts to achieve economic and monetary union 
within the european community hit a snag saturday in disagreements 
among the 12 member states over when and how union should be 
accomplished 
at a oneday session the ec finance ministers reached no accord 
on a timetable for moving toward a single currency and central bank 
patterned after the us federal reserve 
they met with only three months before the final negotiations on 
monetary union are to take place the ministers agreed to meet 
again here in november 
the final talks due to open in december must produce 
amendments to the ecs 1957 founding treaty of rome to bring about 
monetary union 
the meeting was a boost for british prime minister margaret 
thatcher who opposes a single ec currency and an ec central bank 
some ec nations have expressed support britains alternative 
proposals for monetary union 
supporters of a single currency and a central bank notably 
france belgium and italy had hoped saturdays meeting would put 
the final touches on preparatory work for the start of the december 
talks 
the ecs drive for monetary union is a complex threestage 
journey 
the first stage began july 1 and the ec nations now are more 
closely coordinating their economic and monetary policies 
also all ec currencies notably the british pound will join 
the european monetary systems exchange rate mechanism the pound 
the greek drachma and the portuguese escudo are not in the erm now 
on saturday several nations rejected a proposal by the ec 
executive commission that the second stage during which the ec 
would create a central bank begin on jan 1 1993 
west germany britain the netherlands and portugal argued that 
before the second stage begins the ec nations must first narrow 
the gaps between their inflation unemployment and interest rates 
there was a long discussion about the moment at which you must 
go to phase two there are difficulties there said dutch finance 
minister wim kok 
under the ec commissions proposal in the third and final stage 
of monetary union the nations would permanently fix exchange rates 
among their currencies these eventually would be replaced by a 
single currency known as the european currency unit or ecu 
spanish finance minister carlos solchaga saturday proposed that 
a single currency not be created until the year 2000 
he described his proposal as a compromise between britain 
which prefers the retain the 12 ec currencies plus a hard ecu 
and the ec commissions monetary package 
but solchagas plan ran into opposition from west german central 
bank president karl otto poehl who said i am very much against 
it i cannot see many merits in a parallel currency

gov michael s dukakis staff will assess the 
budgetcutting proposals unveiled by his rebellious lieutenant 
governor but some observers said saturday her plan wont solve the 
states fiscal troubles 
lt gov evelyn murphy seized command as acting governor after 
dukakis left the state on a european trade mission and on friday 
she issued her own program 
but dukakis staff is still carrying out the orders he issued 
before he left thursday 
murphy needing some life in her lagging campaign for governor 
had raised expectations about her proposals by refusing to disclose 
them as long as dukakis was still in massachusetts she said she 
was waiting for the former democratic presidential candidate to 
leave so she could assume authority 
she will face two other opponents in the sept 18 democratic 
primary and public opinion polls put her well behind dukakis 
whose popularity has dived is not seeking reelection 
among murphys steps were cutting management positions in each 
cabinet secretariat by 25 percent as well as slashing by 10 
percent the payroll of the department of administration and finance 
murphy said her proposals would save up to 150 million 
annually earlier in the week dukakis had ordered cabinet 
secretaries to find 150 million worth of cuts for the current 
fiscal year 
dukakis refused to comment on her proposals saturday ive got 
a very good team in place at home and i want to get on with this 
trip he said in bitterfeld east germany 
dukakis administration officials said murphys numbers were 
misleading and that her plan would realistically save only about 
17 million this fiscal year 
in terms of real dollar savings it doesnt match up to the 
125 million to 150 million which she says it is said stephen 
crawford a dukakis spokesman 
for people looking to an end to this yearlong nightmare i 
dont think we saw it yesterday said james braude head of the 
tax equity alliance for massachusetts a group that has supported 
higher taxes to help solve the states fiscal woes 
crawford said the governors staff would assess murphys plans 
over the next week dukakis is scheduled to return friday 
dukakis had said he might cut his trip short if any action 
murphy took threatened to hurt the states stability but after 
murphy issued her orders crawford said he saw no reason for the 
governor to return early 
he noted that executive orders requiring payroll cuts would not 
take effect before dukakis comes back since such actions take 10 
days to implement once the governor returns he can rescind 
murphys action but crawford could not predict what action dukakis 
might take 
murphys orders do not supersede the instructions dukakis issued 
earlier in the week to make cuts which means cabinet secretaries 
will still carry out those plans crawford said 
a spokesman for the executive office of human services said his 
agency would proceed with the spending cuts ordered by dukakis 
the secretarys strong position is that he works for mike 
dukakis said kenneth schwartz chief of staff for human services 
secretary philip johnston 
mark longabaugh a spokesman for the lieutenant governor said 
saturday that she stands behind her savings projections 
one element of her plan did not receive as much as attention as 
the payroll cuts he said but was highly important that order 
would require the department of administration and finance to 
submit monthly budget reports documenting whether the states 
books are in balance 
cabinet secretaries who fail to remedy their deficits could lose 
part of their salaries and possibly their jobs 
while murphy has downplayed the political aspects of her action 
saying she was simply looking out for the states wellbeing 
longabaugh acknowledged her supporters believe the campaign has 
gained ground from the episode 
from a political standpoint she looked like a leader she 
looked like she was ready to act he said

a gunman who caused panic by firing shots from 
the top of a highrise before shooting himself and falling to the 
ground was a shy man discouraged because the navy had rejected 
him friends said 
paul fisher was a real good guy who had a lot of personal 
problems said dennis byrd owner of thirstys restaurant amp 
saloon where fisher was a regular 
fisher 35 held police at bay for 5 hours friday from the 
rooftop of a 16story apartment building in one of the citys 
busiest sections he fired at least 11 shots in the air from a 
22caliber rifle 
after pleading with police to kill him fisher shot himself with 
a 25caliber handgun and plunged to the street 
police found a suicide note in fishers wallet but said they 
had not immediately determined why he killed himself 
byrd said fisher a navy reservist was depressed because he 
wanted to join the regular navy but failed to meet a weight 
requirement 
fisher spent the summer trying to lose weight byrd said 
he got disgruntled with being a computer operator and wanted 
to try for a fulltime job with the navy byrd said then when 
he had to deal with that rejection from the navy i think that 
probably had something to do with what happened that must have 
been working and working on him 
he was really bummed out about it said david dietz another 
acquaintance who said he talked with fisher about seven hours 
before fisher opened fire from the roof of the building near the 
university of pittsburgh 
byrd described fisher as a shy bachelor who spent most of his 
evenings and days off at the bar 
he was never an extrovert on the bar scene he was just a joy 
to have around byrd said we were his extended family and he 
was quiet pleasant and generous with us if someone needed money 
for their rent paul would loan it to them if he came into some 
money hed buy drinks for the house 
the navy permits people whose applications are rejected to file 
written objections but fisher did not do that said cmdr john 
wells head of the naval and marine corps reserve centers in 
pittsburgh 
when that situation came up he didnt indicate a preference 
to stay wells said he did not demonstrate a particularly 
gungho attitude

bush administration and 
congressional budget negotiators continued their stretchdrive 
search saturday for about 50 billion in tax increases and spending 
cuts for next year but there were no signs of major progress 
the two sides swapped new offers saturday the second day of 
revived budget talks at andrews air force base just outside 
washington 
on friday each side proposed trimming about 50 billion from 
next years deficit but republicans sought deeper cuts in domestic 
programs and democrats wanted to rely more on defense reductions 
and revenue increases 
democrats offered saturday to seek only about 13 billion in 
defense cuts instead of the 149 billion they had suggested 
friday one official said but republicans who want to pare 
military spending by just 4 billion dismissed the offer as 
inadequate the official said 
another official speaking on condition he not be identified 
said democrats proposed a 10 percent surcharge on income taxes of 
people earning more than 500000 annually 
they have also proposed a wide range of energy levies including 
a 7centagallon boost in the 9cent federal gasoline tax half 
the increase would be to reduce the deficit and half to build new 
roads and bridges the official said 
one source close to the talks speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he believed the bargaining could be on the verge 
of breaking up because democrats were making excessive demands 
for new taxes defense slashes and for increases in some domestic 
programs 
other officials however said there were no indications of any 
problems beyond the usual disagreements between bargainers 
as the negotiators met about 25 federal employee union 
officials and government workers staged an hourlong demonstration 
outside the gates of the air base 
they were protesting the furloughs of tens of thousands of 
federal workers that could occur should the negotiators fail to 
complete a budget deal by oct 1 the start of the new fiscal year 
should the deficit not be reduced by that day the grammrudman 
law will automatically reduce the 12 trillion federal budget by 
about 100 billion agencies are threatening to give many of their 
workers up to 22 days of unpaid leave to make up the shortfall 
were tired of being jerked around as a political football 
said john sturdivant president of the american federation of 
government employees the largest union for federal workers 
meanwhile the negotiators further tightened the restrictions on 
reporters covering the budget talks 
from the start journalists have been restricted to a press 
center about two miles from the andrews officers club where the 
talks are under way 
beginning saturday they were permitted to enter the base or 
leave the press center only with an armed military escort in 
either case they were driven directly to their destinations with 
no detours permitted 
just want to make sure nobodys bothering anybody at the 
oc or officers club one air force official said

pakistani and indian men and women shouting at her please help 
us we have no food no water you are our only hope 
the queen shook hands and assured the refugees who were left 
penniless after fleeing iraqioccupied kuwait we are doing

tears from the bedraggled womans cheeks

an airline executive has been married to jordans king hussein 
since 1978 
official estimates say more than 250000 foreigners mostly 
asians have crossed the desert border post at ruweishid since the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
jordans meager resources are inadequate to provide food 
shelter and transportation for the more than 100000 refugees 
stranded in camps along its desert border 
the queen who arrived by helicopter flew twice low over the 
shalaan i camp housing more than 40000 refugees in a square mile 
of arid desert near the ruweishid border post 200 miles northeast 
of the jordanian capital amman 
after viewing the hundreds of makeshift shelters set up to keep 
out the desert sun ranging from tents to colored womens saris 
tied to sticks noor drove her fourwheeldrive mercedes through 
the camp 
she stopped more than a dozen times getting out of the car to 
mingle with refugees and walk through the dusty litterstrewn 
passages between the rows of tents 
we understand how you feel you are not forgotten noor kept 
saying to the crowds pressing around her 
dressed in a blue shirt and anklelength khaki skirt over brown 
boots the queen stood out amid the unkempt refugees 
an elderly indian woman who found herself next to the queen in 
the crush asked who are you 
ive just come from amman noor replied as the minister next 
to her informed the indian she was the queen 
god bless you the woman blurted overwhelmed by the 
realization she had spoken with the queen

the man 
an airlift operation for indians got under way saturday with 
indians flying from amman to dubai where indian air force 
transports are carrying them home 
in amman officials from the middle east council of churches met 
with noor and others involved in relief efforts 
gabriel habib the councils general secretary called for 
governments to intensify efforts to airlift the refugees to their 
home countries saying their situation was becoming desperate 
shortly before noors visit thousands of refugees had been 
standing in parallel singlefile lines stretching for more than a 
mile waiting their turn to receive their meager daily ration of a 
piece of bread a tomato a cucumber and a bottle of water 
scuffles broke out repeatedly as people at the back of the line 
grew impatient and tried to move ahead to get to the trailer truck 
where the food was being distributed 
at the end of her visit noor appealed for international help to 
assist the refugees asking for food tents blankets and medicine 
and most importantly ships and planes to take them home 
i cant tell how long their repatriation will take days or 
weeks but god forbid it should take months she said we must 
impress on the world these people are living in even minimally 
unacceptable conditions

an international team arrived saturday 
in this summit city hoping to persuade the american and soviet 
presidents to discuss the fate of swedish diplomat raoul wallenberg 
the commission members including wallenbergs halfbrother guy 
von dardel said they wanted to hand soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev a letter urging him to press the kgb to open its files on 
wallenberg 
the panel planned a news conference sunday while the superpower 
leaders are talking about the persian gulf crisis but they said 
they did not expect to obtain a meeting with president bush 
wallenberg is credited with saving tens of thousands of 
hungarian jews from the nazis during world war ii but he vanished 
after the soviets arrested him in budapest 
the soviet union said in 1957 that prison documents showed the 
swede had died of a heart attack in moscows lubyanka prison in 
1947 the commission believes he may still be alive 
we are closer to finding out the truth about raoul wallenberg 
than weve been for the past 45 years said marvin markinen an 
american professor and former inmate of vladimir prison where 
wallenberg reportedly was spotted 
the wallenberg case has never been on a summit agenda but it 
has also never been on the soviet public agenda like it is now 
said canadian irwin cotler of the sovietinternational joint 
commission on the fate and whereabouts of raoul wallenberg 
soviet television last week showed a drawing of wallenberg the 
way he might look if he were alive today at the age of 77 the 
report appealed to the public for help in tracing him cotler said 
two years ago no one in the street would have known who 
wallenberg was he said 
swedish authorities presented moscow with witness reports that 
wallenberg was alive in the 1950s and 60s and had been seen by 
nonsoviets at vladimir prison 12 miles outside moscow the 
commission said there had been less reliable reports of sightings 
in the 1970s and 80s 
but the commission last week said it had found that soviet 
authorities never looked into the records at the prison although 
they said at the time they had done so 
therefore the commission said it found it hard to trust the 
death certificate produced in 1957 
cotler said the commission believed wallenbergs name would be 
found only on classified lists of the kgb the soviet secret police 
and intelligence agency 
cotler said soviet minister of internal affairs vadim bakatin 
promised in a meeting saturday he would bring up the matter with 
kgb head vadim kryuchkov 
if the kgb is not cooperating there are now parliamentary 
ways of holding them responsible said cotler 
if gorbachev wants to open up the blank pages of the soviet 
history here is an opportunity gorbachev has knowledge of the kgb 
and the capacity to open their files cotler said 
the commission which was formed two weeks ago includes five 
soviet experts who have been granted access to prison archives 
closed to foreigners 
von dardel said he had worked for 10 years to get the soviets 
included in an international investigation he said the doors of 
soviet ministries and prisons had opened up remarkably since that 
occurred

three young hemophiliac brothers who doctors 
say were infected with the aids virus through contaminated blood 
products have lost their legal fight against two drug companies 
that made such products 
a federal judge cleared the companies of any responsibility 
because ricky robert and randy ray couldnt specify who made the 
products they took for their hemophilia that exposed them to 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich granted the drug 
companies request friday and dismissed a 1988 case filed on behalf 
of ricky 13 robert 12 and randy 10 
without showing a direct cause of the damages the family cannot 
sue for negligence the judge ruled 
the rays drew national attention in 1987 when they were shunned 
by the community of arcadia and barred from school after their 
health problems became known 
parents louise and clifford ray sued the desoto county school 
board in federal court and won an order from ms kovachevich that 
the boys be reinstated 
angry frightened parents of classmates boycotted the elementary 
school a week later the rays home was burned down in an unsolved 
arson the family has since settled in sarasota 
in april doctors said robert has fullblown aids 
the rays sued cutter laboratories a berkeley calif division 
of miles inc and armour pharmaceutical co of blue bell pa 
claiming they were negligent in the manufacture and distribution of 
blood coagulating agents needed by hemophiliacs 
the suit alleged the companies failed to screen out highrisk 
blood donors from whose plasma the clotting agents are obtained 
failed to test the products for aids and failed to warn users of 
the risks of contracting aids 
lawyers for the companies argued the rays and their doctors 
could not specifically identify which clotting agent infected the 
boys 
it was something we expected said san francisco lawyer 
duncan barr who defended the case for cutter 
he said the boys were heavily treated with clotting agent 
produced by about five different companies he said there was no 
way to tell which companys product caused the infection if any 
or if it may have been caused by whole blood they received 
during the litigation cutter laboratories mistakenly gave the 
rays attorneys a memo showing that cutters own attorney 
recommended as early as 1982 that plasma products carry warnings 
about aids cutter and armour didnt begin including the warnings 
until 1984

president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev arrived saturday for summit talks spawned by 
the persian gulf crisis bush said he hoped for common ground 
against iraq that would usher in a more peaceful stable and 
secure postcold war era 
gorbachev said it was important for the two men to cooperate to 
protect positive trends taking place elsewhere in the world 
iraqs saddam hussein directed presummit advice to the two 
leaders telling bush the prestige of the united states would sink 
if it were to slide into the abyss of war and telling gorbachev 
that siding with the americans would increase world doubts about 
soviet status as a superpower 
saddam in a statement read on iraqi televison by a spokesman 
said that as the two men weigh summit decisions the angels will 
be hovering above you on one side and devils on the other 
bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft suggested 
later that the prospect of ussoviet unity on the persian gulf 
was upsetting saddam 
we hope it causes him to lose some sleep scowcroft said 
after a working dinner with bush and other top aides 
the fivehour summit held out the prospect of an extraordinary 
joint declaration against iraqs invasion of kuwait also on the 
agenda for the hastily arranged meeting were sticky arms control 
disputes the future of europe and other traditional eastwest 
concerns as well as possible aid to the soviet union 
in saudi arabia a diplomatic source said gorbachev came to 
helsinki prepared to offer the soviet maritime fleet to the united 
states to transport equipment to the middle east and to withdraw 
the roughly 1000 soviet advisers from iraq 
the monthold us military deployment has been handicapped by 
the lack of sealift for materiel 
here in helsinki the usual summit accoutrements were in 
evidence from the extremely tight security to the soviet american 
and finnish flags flying side by side by side tshirts showing the 
faces of bush and gorbachev superimposed on saddams visage were 
selling for 20 
bush and gorbachev accompanied by their wives arrived seven 
hours apart to identical red carpet greetings from finnish 
president mauno koivisto 
the summit will be their third as leaders of their countries 
bush denounced iraq sharply in his arrival remarks saying it 
must be denied the fruits of aggression gorbachev spoke in 
more restrained terms of the need to ensure that positive trends in 
the world are not thwarted by any development he did not 
mention iraq or saddam by name 
both bush and gorbachev made it clear they were hoping to use 
the summit to continue the improvement in relations between their 
two countries 
if you want to think of a complicated situation shift the 
clock back several years and think about how difficult it would be 
to work this equation now get the international support that has 
been gotten but try to do it without the soviet union being a part 
of it bush said 
clearly i hope that well come out of this meeting tomorrow 
not with every difference ironed out but with a common purpose so 
that the united states and the soviet union will be seen by 
others around the world to be in accord in our determination to 
stop this ugly aggression he added 
he called gorbachev not some adversary but the leader of a 
country with whom i think were going to have increasingly 
productive relations 
if the nations of the world acting together continue as 
they have been to isolate iraq and deny saddam the fruits of 
aggression we will set in place the cornerstone of an 
international order more peaceful stable and secure than any that 
we have known 
he added much is at stake and there is much the world stands 
to gain if we succeed 
gorbachev said it was important for the two men to meet 
personally to discuss the acute crisis in the persian gulf and a 
number of other issues and to cooperate 
the white house took pains to minimize the chances for an arms 
control breakthrough at the summit even though talks are moving 
slowly to reduce nuclear stockpiles as well as to cut conventional 
forces in europe this is not a negotiating session said one 
official 
helsinki is no stranger to important international meetings 
finlandia hall where bush and gorbachev will hold a news 
conference after their talks was the site for the signing in 1975 
of an international accord on human rights 
secretary of state james a baker iii arrived shortly before 
gorbachev after a trip to the middle east to drum up increased 
support for the effort to isolate iraq 
egyptian president hosni mubarak pledged more troops to defend 
saudi arabia and said the summit participants should stand firm on 
sanctions ordered by the un security council against iraq i 
hope that gorbachev and bush have one line for dealing with this 
problem he said this would be a hell of problem in this area 
if there are differences 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrived with 
gorbachev one day after declaring he was ready if necessary to 
go to iraq to seek a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis 
bush plunged into a schedule of appearances lasting through the 
morning and early afternoon despite his overnight flight from 
washington 
he stopped his limousine to shake hands briefly with the crowds 
along his route between stops mel hughes told reporters he was the 
mayor of rancho palos verdes calif and that it was terrific to 
shake the presidents hand even if we had to come all the way to 
finland to do it 
gorbachev had barely arrived when he waded into a crowd along 
the street 
before arriving bush told reporters he would be interested in 
pursuing a possible deal with gorbachev in which the united states 
would give the soviets oilproducing technology perhaps involving 
pipelines in exchange the soviet union would make some of its 
vast oil reserves available to the west to make up for supplies 
lost from the persian gulf 
bush said he did not plan to ask gorbachev to send ground forces 
to supplement the usled deployment in saudi arabia 
the soviets have been urging a diplomatic solution to the 
persian gulf crisis but foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov said earlier that the soviet union would be willing to 
send military forces to the middle east under a military staff 
committee that included officers from the five permanent members of 
the un security council 
bush also said he wanted very much to visit us troops in 
saudi arabia but planned to wait until all our forces are there 
and things calm down he said he hoped the american military 
deployment in the persian gulf will keep saddam hussein from 
doing anything reckless

animal rights activists picketed new england 
aquarium on saturday over its proposal to send an antisocial 
dolphin to a topsecret navy research center but the aquarium 
director said no decision has been made 
rainbow an 11yearold 8foot2 450pound male bluegray 
bottlenose dolphin would be swapped for a partly deaf female in the 
navys secret underwater mammal program at the naval ocean systems 
center in san diego 
we are vehemently opposed to any dolphin being given to the 
navy under any circumstances said doreen close a spokeswoman 
for the boston marine mammal coalition once they get into the 
navys hands we have no way of knowing what happens to them 
john h prescott the aquariums executive director said public 
concern over rainbows future has led him to reconsider the trade 
about 60 members of the coalition and other activists peacefully 
picketed the aquarium protesting the proposed swap of the dolphins 
we capture them we use them we abuse them then we dump 
them said richard obarry a former trainer of the dolphins on 
the 1960s television series flipper he was not affiliated with 
the marine mammal coalition 
aquarium officials say rainbow is too aggressive and has become 
less compatible with other dolphins at the aquarium as he has 
matured 
the naval ocean systems center studies and trains 142 marine 
mammals 109 of which are dolphins in underwater surveillance and 
detecting and marking objects for recovery further details on the 
centers purpose are classified 
prescott said the swap was considered because the navy could use 
rainbows sonar and hearing for its research while the partly deaf 
female from the center would be suitable with those at the aquarium 
obarry said dolphins in captivity are abused simply by being 
placed inside steel or concrete tanks they become ill and 
stressed he said 
you cant take a sonic creature and put it in a steel box 
its different from every other animal in that aquarium he said 
they are animals of sound 
in may a former trainer of the navy center alleged that the 
navy was training bottlenose dolphins with 45caliber guns mounted 
on their snouts to kill enemy frogmen officials at the center 
denied those claims 
a federal marine mammal commission probe found no major problems 
with the centers program or dolphin deaths in the past 13 months 
that probe was initiated because of reports in 1988 that 13 
dolphins in the navy had died between 1986 and 1988 
any dolphin in the world is in more danger from swimming into 
drift nets than from any training program of the navy said 
kathy krieger curator of marine mammals at the aquarium 
she said nosc research has helped aquariums in caring for their 
dolphins and whales

the us education department is withholding 28 
million from seattle schools while it reviews the school boards 
decision to relax racialbalance guidelines district officials say 
schools superintendent william kendrick told board members 
friday that the government wants to review the new guidelines 
before deciding whether to release federal funds for magnet 
programs designed to encourage desegregation 
there is a strong possibility that no money will be available 
to us for magnet programs this school year kendrick said in a 
memo 
the new guidelines approved wednesday on a 43 board vote seek 
to reduce mandatory busing by allowing more minority and white 
students to attend the schools of their choice 
the plan allows 75 percent of a schools population to come from 
a single group including whites it also allows 100 percent 
minority student population 75 percent asian and 25 percent 
black for example 
previous guidelines called for a maximum of 50 percent from any 
one minority group 70 percent total minorities or 65 percent white 
supporters said the new guidelines would help curb white flight 
from the district 
critics contended the move was a step back that could lead to 
allminority schools they also said the new guidelines could 
jeopardize federal magnet funds state construction funds and open 
the district to lawsuits 
under federal guidelines a school is considered segregated if 
minority enrollment is more than 50 percent though schools can 
receive money if improvements are made without meeting that 
standard 
board member ken eastlack who proposed the new guidelines said 
he would propose amending the plan to exempt schools that receive 
federal magnet funds 
he said wednesday he was willing to risk the federal magnet 
funds to keep district enrollment up the district loses 3400 in 
state funds when a student leaves the district 
magnet programs will be in place when students return to school 
monday but officials are unsure how long the programs can continue 
without federal funds five high schools and 14 elementary schools 
had magnet programs last year 
the education department has requested information on how the 
new racialbalance guidelines will affect integration said patty 
mcdonald district communityrelations director 
the agency will then determine whether the district still 
qualifies for magnet funds mcdonald said she was unsure whether 
the district would eliminate the magnet programs or try to cut 
other parts of the district budget 
the new guidelines will not take effect immediately but would 
give 3000 students on a waiting list a better chance of attending 
the school of their choice 
last year the district was allotted 32 million in federal 
magnet funds 
even before wednesdays vote the education department withheld 
417000 from last years magnet package for two high schools the 
agency considered segregated giving the district until sept 15 to 
find a way to desegregate them 
seattle schools receive a total of 128 million in federal 
funds this year for other programs including hot lunches special 
education and supplementary programs for academically and 
economically disadvantaged children

the trial of a 20yearold state 
legislators son accused of killing his mother with a hunting arrow 
was recessed saturday by a visibly angry judge responding to a 
defense motion for a mistrial 
defense attorney henri conti asked for a mistrial after state 
rep robert goetsch testified about a twofoot pipe weapon found at 
the scene of his wifes death 
conti said district attorney kevin schram had not previously 
disclosed information about the pipe 
it was withheld and dropped on us today conti said its 
substantially prejudicial its poisoned the well its grounds for 
a mistrial 
court rules require the prosecution to disclose evidence and 
testimony that is expected on the stand so the defense can 
adequately prepare its case 
goetschs son chad is charged with firstdegree intentional 
homicide for fatally shooting 51yearold carolyn goetsch in the 
heart with the arrow on nov 8 
chad also is charged with recklessly endangering safety for 
pointing a second arrow at his father and fighting with him after 
mrs goetsch was shot 
dodge county circuit judge daniel klossner said he would 
consider the motion for a mistrial unless prosecution and defense 
lawyers can come to an agreement that would allow curative 
instructions to the jury 
klossner said he would rule on the mistrial motion monday after 
considering the attorneys proposed jury instructions 
goetsch described the circumstances surrounding his wifes death 
at the familys home in the town of oak grove 
conti made the motion for a mistrial after goetsch testified his 
son made the pipe weapon last fall to protect himself after being 
attacked and robbed 
schram said he learned about the pipe while talking informally 
to robert goetsch on aug 22 he said the conversation does not 
fall under the rules of evidence and did not need to be revealed to 
the defense 
in other testimony goetsch said his son threatened mrs goetsch 
so often last summer and fall that she talked about buying a gun 
because she was afraid her son would kill her 
i guess she did take them the threats more seriously than 
i goetsch said we talked about buying a gun she started 
insisting on locking the doors she said she was afraid of him she 
was afraid he was going to kill her 
the day his wife died goetsch said his wife got out of bed 
early in the morning after both heard a knock on the door goetsch 
said he heard his wifes voice and another voice but went back to 
sleep until he was awakened by loud screaming 
his wife appeared in the doorway of their bedroom and collapsed 
he said when he went to the body he said he saw his son standing 
in the hallway aiming a loaded hunting bow at him 
goetsch said he lunged over the body and grabbed the arrow 
pointed at him and broke it he said he and chad then fought for 
several minutes throughout the house while his daughter shana then 
14 tried to call police 
chad broke away at least once and attacked his sister while she 
called authorities goetsch said 
goetsch said he asked his son who was supposed to be away at 
college why did you kill my wife why are you here 
he said his son replied i was lonesome

thirty years ago bedlam broke out at the 
national baptist convention in philadelphia forcing the 
denomination into a leadership battle that led to the last major 
split in black baptist history 
the 110th annual meeting of the national baptist convention 
usa inc that wraps up with a worship service sunday has been a 
kinder gentler affair buit some say similar issues remain 
the denomination raised 1 million to reduce the mortgage on its 
first headquarters the 10 million world baptist center in 
nashville tenn and delegates unanimously approved a resolution 
urging the government to keep us troops out of combat in the 
persian gulf 
the most significant thing i think has been the general 
spirit of the convention there has been more fellowship more 
spirit than ever said the rev tj jemison convention 
president 
others say issues that led to the crisis in 1960 including 
perceptions of a president unwilling to share power are rising 
again 
the battle in the 1960 convention was over power the rev 
joseph h jackson who ousted jemisons father the rev dv 
jemison from the presidency in 1953 consolidated his own power 
and ignored tenure requirements 
in 1960 civil rights leaders such as the rev martin luther 
king jr and the rev ralph d abernathy wanted the nations 
largest black church to become a force for social change 
that led to a large group of baptists to support for president a 
civil rights candidate the rev gardner c taylor rival groups 
paraded throughout the convention each side trying to drown out 
the other 
it was extremely painful for me recalled the rev arlene h 
churn who was a teenager at the 1960 convention i can remember 
curtains being torn down from the convention hall chairs being 
overturned altercations 
after taylor won a disputed election the issue of who 
controlled the convention went to the federal courts which ruled 
they did not have jurisdiction in an ecclesiastical dispute 
the stage was set for the fateful break at the kansas city 
convention in 1961 
in that convention said historian taylor branch masses of 
preachers supporting either taylor or jackson collided like a giant 
rugby scrum shoving slugging and wrestling each other out of the 
way to take control of the convention in the melee the rev ag 
wright of detroit was killed when he fell off the platform 
jackson won the battle many opposition preachers left to form 
the progressive national baptist convention jackson was to rule 
the national baptist convention until 1982 when he was ousted and 
jemison took over 
the jemison administration held promise for many of a more 
aggressive social agenda and a more collegial powersharing within 
the denomination 
in 1984 the convention voted to begin limiting the presidency 
to two fiveyear terms 
most people agree that jemison who led the baton rouge la 
boycott of segregated busing in 1953 has been more socially active 
in his presidential address this year jemison decried what he 
said was the deterioration of race relations in the nation 
charging that former president reagan gave respectability to racism 
and referring to conservatives on the supreme court as strict 
segregationists 
jemison also is credited with being the driving force behind the 
baptist center dedicated in 1989 in nashville he called the 
denominational headquarters the first of its kind for a black 
church body our vatican 
the rev w franklyn richardson convention general secretary 
said the center which is designed to address social issues such as 
aids homelessness and other denominational programs is a sign 
of hope to national baptists 
but some others say the building reflects a denomination more 
concerned with elaborate structures than social needs 
this really saddens me to see 10 million in the glorification 
of a center versus all the nation crying out for help delegate 
al lipscomb of dallas said 
while some ministers say jemison has shown some signs of greater 
collegiality including appointing more younger members to 
positions of prominence than his predecessor others say there is 
concern throughout the church about the issue of sharing authority 
the leadership of the president has been a strong 
leadership the rev paul thompson of new hope baptist church in 
buffalo ny said there is concern about trying to share that 
leadership more 
the real test is expected in 1994 when jemison would be obliged 
by the tenure rules he helped institute to step down from the 
presidency jemison has refused to say whether he would seek the 
presidency again in 1994 
thats too far away he said friday

following are excerpts translated from 
arabic by the associated press from iraqi president saddam 
husseins message to presidents bush and mikhail gorbachev on the 
eve of the superpower summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
your meeting will be watched with keen and unusual interest by 
the whole world including the peoples of a region which god 
blessed by making us a part of the arab nation 
i will neither plead with you nor dictate what decisions you 
must adopt because each of you has his own will and freedom of 
decision 
but before you make whatever decisions you will i would like 
to begin by saying that iraqs army did not invade either of your 
countries and has no intention to harm anyone or jeopardize the 
legitimate interests of anyone iraq is a peaceloving nation we 
desire peace which is based on justice iraq respects the free 
decision of others 
before either of you make a decision on kuwait you should 
remember that the arab nation is one nation even though it is 
split now that this is a fact that cannot be denied by its rulers 
leaders peoples or sons that the overwhelming majority of its 
sons rulers and peoples are honored to be part of this great 
nation and that they are longing to be one political entity 
regardless of the specific characteristics of this or that country 
 
kuwait is part of iraq the kuwaiti people are part of the 
iraqi people british colonialism severed it from iraq for colonial 
reasons iraq did not recognize this measure 
any attempt to reverse the situation to what it was before 
aug 2 1990 is an impractical and sterile attempt that will push 
the region into chaos furthermore the attempts aimed at promoting 
the instability constitute a premeditated conspiracy against the 
arab nation at the head of which is lofty iraq 
when you consider these facts in their proper perspective and 
show humility once you know the rights of mankind you will realize 
that the arabs by their recollection of the relevant background on 
the basis of these facts are more capable than others of resolving 
all interarab affairs 
you will also then realize that foreigners including 
yourselves are incapable of offering the proper solution 
neither of you is capable of providing a proper settlement of 
an arab problem whose parties are arabs we can swear and god and 
history are witness to this that the foreign intervention is 
complicating matters and will not provide a settlement 
the occupation and invasion of the prophets birthplace and 
tomb is an insult directed not only against the 200 million arabs 
but the 1 billion moslems 
they will join and pool all resources to resist this obscene 
act and defeat the oppressors 
every politician knows the united states and for awhile now 
has been manipulating the world and dictating its terms with no one 
standing up to confront it as the case was before 
those concerned with this problem should take advantage of 
this crucial time in history and employ this critical problem to 
restore to the soviet union its respect as a decisive power 
through adopting a position that is in harmony with all that is 
just and fair and rejecting the discriminatory approach the united 
states is pursuing 
i pray that the merciful allow you to take decisions that 
would allow some light into the hearts of the heartless espcially 
bush in the interest of humanity at large 
president bush must not bring his country and its status down 
to a lower level because we are certain that its position will 
drop on the scale of appreciation and effectiveness if it falls 
into the abyss of war and if its armies and the armies of its 
allies remain in the land of our sanctuaries and if it continues 
this unjustified and cruel blockade which is depriving the people 
of iraq of food and medicine and cutting off the supply of milk 
from children who need it 
the iraqi people will stand united against injustice and the 
unjust and against the invasion and the invaders the traitors 
who encouraged those who have been deluded will be a small 
minority 
when the battle has taken place then the iraqi people whom 
god has chosen to be in the forefront will triumph and all the 
invaders will be defeated their banners torn apart and deafened 
by the shouts of god is great and damned be the invaders

michael w robinson in washington declined to elaborate in his 
statement friday but a lawyer in kentucky said federal agents are 
trying to determine whether anyone tampered with the information 
robinson would not comment on whether anyone viewed the files or 
distributed the data 
the justice departments announcement came a day after 
businessman charles hayes of rural pulaski county identified 
customers who bought surplus computer equipment from him believed 
to contain the secret files 
hayes paid 45 for a broken word processing system from the us 
attorneys office in lexington on aug 3 but a technician failed 
to erase the computers memory giving hayes seven years worth of 
secret files 
the data contained names of fbi informants federally protected 
witnesses and details of pending criminal and civil cases 
according to court records 
retrieval of the computers is significant the justice 
department feared the secret files might land in the wrong hands 
and ruin pending criminal and civil cases handled by the office of 
us attorney louis defalaise 
to complicate matters hayes later sold some of the computer 
equipment hayes owns challenger ltd which buys government 
surplus equipment for resale to the public 
hayes attorney bill d gregory said government officials told 
him the equipment would be examined for signs of tampering 
gregory said he is contemplating a countersuit against the 
government for its handling of the case he contends a deposition 
hayes gave thursday will show the pulaski county businessman is 
cooperating fully with the government 
justice department lawyers did not file a transcript of hayes 
fivehour secret deposition the us district court clerks office 
said government attorneys had said they would file the transcript 
but would censor any sensitive details

an iraqi airways charter flight arrived 
late saturday carrying 130 americans from kuwait including a woman 
who gave birth to twins while fighting raged around her in the 
conquered nation 
i could hear the bombs while i was in labor said claudia 
ledesma of san diego calif who delivered her babies on aug 26 
while some resistance activity continued against the iraqis 22 days 
after they invaded kuwait 
mrs ledesma and her fellow passengers women and children who 
had been allowed to leave kuwait by iraqi president saddam hussein 
arrived thirsty hungry and exhausted 
iraq meanwhile said it would no longer fly evacuees to jordan 
the us state department said evacuation flights will continue 
to other destinations despite the order which was to take effect 
sunday 
the charter flight arrived in amman just before midnight with 
130 people on board us embassy sources said 
embassy officials said earlier the plane was carrying about 150 
americans there was no explanation for the discrepancy in figures 
the charter stopped over in baghdad where the passengers were 
issued with exit permits before flying on to amman which has been 
the primary transit point for thousands of evacuees fleeing iraq 
and kuwait 
some of the americans including several infants were examined 
by physicians while they were crowded in a terminal waiting room at 
queen alia international airport 
one woman in a purple shirt and glasses held a small white 
poodle a teenage boy was wearing an oakland raiders cap and black 
tshirt 
a us embassy spokesman said they were to board a northwest 
airlines charter to frankfurt west germany and then after 
refueling would continue to a us air force base in charleston 
sc about 165 american evacuees who arrived on a similar charter 
on friday will join them on the trip home 
the latest group of evacuees applauded as an embassy 
representative gave a brief statement but they were behind glass 
windows and reporters could not hear what he said 
other embassy representatives took care of their needs with 
bottled water sandwiches and soft drinks 
later mrs ledesma held one baby in her arms and a friend stood 
by her holding the other while they talked briefly with reporters 
describing the difficulty of choosing to leave their husbands 
behind for safety outside kuwait 
he said that he wanted the children to have an opportunity and 
that since the us embassy was giving it to us we wouldnt lose 
it mrs ledesma said 
saddam banned the men from traveling and is holding some of them 
at key installations to fend off an attack against iraq by 
thousands of usled forces that assembled in saudi arabia after 
the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
a woman who identified herself only as renee said the kuwaitis 
were very much opposed to saddam and that people she knew there 
were suffering 
they dont deserve this they are being attacked there is 
looting she said 
naji alhadithi director general of iraqs information 
ministry told reporters in baghdad earlier that jordanian airport 
officials had complained they could no longer handle the hundreds 
of foreigners that have been pouring into amman for the past week 
he said a charter flight on saturday to the jordanian capital of 
amman would be the last 
alhadithi said the two regularly scheduled iraqi airways 
flights daily from baghdad to amman would not be affected he said 
iraq would be willing to reroute the charters to other destinations 
we are ready to take them to any other capital or city even 
to the farthest point he said 
the director general also said that the shorthaul charters to 
amman paid for by the passengers governments were not profitable 
a spokesman for the amman airport denied there was a crowding 
problem everything is fine the airport is not crowded said 
mashhour elkurashi 
jordans official news agency reported that 14000 evacuees from 
iraq and kuwait including arabs asians and westerners departed 
from amman airport aboard 66 charter flights friday 
those arriving iraqi airways charters usually transfer 
imediately to other planes for the journey to their home countries 
iraq had been allowing up to three charter flights a day from 
baghdad to jordan

bread shortages have spread from moscow to other 
cities including leningrad and soldiers have been mobilized to 
help bakers in the capital soviet media reported saturday 
there is a terrible shortage of flour and yeast the head of 
leningrads central baking plants told pravda the communist party 
newspaper 
suppliers are letting us down and they in turn as far as i 
understand dont have enough grain weve had to tap even our 
normally inviolable reserves said the bakery chief identified 
only as v ivanov 
long lines for bread appeared in moscow during the past week for 
the first time since the early 1960s soviet officials blamed 
hoarding antiquated equipment and a sudden rise in demand as 
residents returned from their traditional august vacations 
the shortage initially was reported only in the moscow region 
where the military newspaper red star reported that hundreds of 
soldiers were ordered to temporary duty as bakery workers and 
delivery men 
on saturday pravda said long lines for bread also had appeared 
in leningrad and tula about 125 miles south of moscow the 
workers newspaper trud also reported a bread shortage in 
archangel a white sea port 620 miles northeast of the capital 
a bakery official in tula blamed reports from moscow which he 
said had touched off a wave of panic buying 
the bread shortage comes at the end of a long summer of other 
shortages that have tried the patience of soviet consumers 
including a lack of cigarettes medicine gasoline and paper 
there have been street protests in moscow leningrad and other 
cities and a riot in the siberian city of chelyabinsk a leader of 
the traditionalist faction with the communist party ivan polozkov 
said tuesday that the lack of goods was causing people to question 
president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reform program 
the bread shortage is occurring in the midst of a record soviet 
grain harvest estimated by the us department of agriculture at 
about 215 million tons 
the problem analysts say is that a shortage of fuel and 
machinery is preventing the crop from being harvested quickly and 
transported efficiently to market 
according to soviet press reports a quarter of the countrys 
combine harvesters are idle for lack of spare parts deliveries of 
other vehicles and supplies are behind schedule as a result grain 
had been harvested from only 28 million acres by midsummer down 
from 40 million acres at the same time last year

a mohawk warrior and two soldiers were injured 
saturday in a scuffle on the kahnesatake settlement west of 
montreal where canadian troops were locked in a standoff with a 
group of armed indians 
mohawk spokesmen said a 51yearold mohawk was awakened in his 
sleep and severely beaten by soldiers 
the army said the mohawk drew a knife and attacked a soldier 
the soldier was on a reconnaissance patrol to check out 
defensive positions put up by the indians the army said in a 
statement troops have surrounded the indians within a small wooded 
area and have put up a barbed wire fence 
the soldier told the mohawk that he had no aggressive 
intentions but the indian attacked him the army said 
the patrol of four soldiers subdued the indian who suffered a 
gash near an eye that required stitches 
one soldier was slashed on the face and another stabbed four 
times in the abdomen but their injuries were not considered 
serious the army said 
a doctor who examined mohawk identified only by his warrior 
code name of spudwrench said he had suffered multiple 
lacerations and a possible depressed skull fracture 
after lengthy negotiations the mohawk was taken to a montreal 
hospital by ambulance under an army escort in the early evening 
more than 12 hours after the clash 
joan lamontagne a spokesman for montreal general hospital said 
the mohawk was undergoing medical tests and that she did not know 
the extent of his injuries 
the incident raised tensions among the mohawks who were also 
upset by a decision by the canadian broadcasting corp to pull its 
camera crews out of the indian encampment 
about 20 mohawk men and 30 women and children are holed up in a 
detoxification center in the wooded area in the kahnesatake 
settlement 18 miles west of montreal they are surrounded by about 
400 soldiers 
they retreated to the center after the army moved in last 
weekend to dismantle barricades set up by the indians 
also saturday the iroquois confederacy held a news conference 
to present a proposal to end the conflict which began july 11 when 
quebec provincial police stormed a mohawk barricade erected to 
protest a decision by the town of oka to expand a municipal golf 
course onto land claimed by the indians 
the iroquois proposal similar to one rejected earlier by 
federal negotiators calls for ending the standoff by imposing 
indian control over the area occupied by the troops with indian 
peacekeeping officers investigating anyone suspected of committing 
crimes 
natives say they fear reprisals from the quebec police for the 
death of one of their officers in the botched raid in july 
federal indian affairs minister tom siddon quickly dismissed the 
proposal as unacceptable because it would cede canadian 
sovereignty to the mohawk people 
quebec premier robert bourassa broke off talks late last month 
with the mohawks and ordered the army in to remove barricades set 
up by the indians 
the dispute over the golf course expansion was resolved when the 
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to 
the indians but the mohawks have raised a wider range of 
grievances including demands for sovereignty

supreme court nominee david h souter has yet 
to face strong opposition as he goes into senate confirmation 
hearings this week but some groups still have doubts about his 
positions on abortion and other contentious issues 
souters hearings begin thursday and some senate judiciary 
committee members say they will press the new hampshire judge for 
his views on the vexing social issues hed face on the nations 
highest court 
but souter may prove a reluctant witness disappointing those 
senators and angering liberal groups worried about his future votes 
on such issues as abortion affirmative action and churchstate 
relations 
souter because of his relative anonymity did not face the same 
immediate and fierce liberal opposition that confronted robert h 
bork before his high court nomination was rejected by the senate in 
1987 
but many of the groups that helped defeat bork say the onus is 
on souter to dispel their doubts 
nan aron of the alliance for justice said souters record 
points to rejection it is incumbent on him to reassure us that 
he would respect individual rights if we are not satisfied with 
his answers we will ask the us senate to reject his nomination 
the liberal national organization for women and the national 
lawyers guild already have announced their opposition 
other liberal groups such as people for the american way the 
national abortion rights action league and the leadership 
conference on civil rights have refrained from opposing souters 
nomination outright 
ralph neas of the leadership conference said there is nothing 
or little in judge souters record to demonstrate a commitment to 
civil rights or social justice 
the consensus so far there is not enough to derail his 
nomination 
even some souter opponents concede that the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait which has focused public attention elsewhere benefits 
souters chance of being confirmed as the supreme courts 105th 
justice 
some conservative groups such as coalitions for america and 
concerned women for america are backing souters nomination 
the groups supporting souter say he should not be asked about 
his personal views on social issues and past supreme court rulings 
that would preclude for example asking souter his opinion of the 
1973 decision in roe vs wade that legalized abortion 
the groups opposing souter or leaning that way say such 
questions or some very similar are precisely what the senate must 
ask to determine souters fitness for the high court 
liberal groups point to a brief filed by new hampshire when 
souter was attorney general in voicing fears that he is 
antiabortion they also point to a speech he gave in the late 
1970s to question his commitment to affirmative action 
as attorney general souter once defended a sinceinvalidated 
new hampshire law that provided for the flying of flags at half 
staff at state office buildings on good friday the liberals say 
that action indicates souters insensitivity to the 
constitutionally required separation of church and state 
liberal groups also have found about a dozen opinions souter 
wrote while he was a new hampshire supreme court justice they say 
the opinions show a lack of commitment to the rights of minorities 
and women 
the preliminary infighting about the senates proper role 
reflects the stakes 
souter if confirmed would replace retired justice william j 
brennan the courts leading liberal for three decades at a time 
when the court is closely divided on abortion affirmative action 
churchstate relations and criminal justice matters 
in contrast the 1986 nomination of conservative antonin scalia 
caused few waves he was nominated and won easy confirmation to 
replace another conservative retired chief justice warren e 
burger 
among the judiciary committees 14 members souters most 
probing interrogators likely will be democratic sens edward m 
kennedy of massachusetts and howard metzenbaum of ohio they are 
the committees two most ardent liberals 
but sen charles grassley riowa a conservative also says he 
intends to ask souter to flesh out his views on significant legal 
issues including abortion grassley is strongly antiabortion 
the committees other members are democrats joseph biden of 
delaware patrick leahy of vermont paul simon of illinois herb 
kohl of wisconsin dennis deconcini of arizona and howell heflin of 
alabama and republicans strom thurmond of south carolina orrin 
hatch of utah alan simpson of wyoming gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire and arlen specter of pennsylvania

rappa told his supporters you have my heartfelt thanks you

his supporters wanted carper to defeat rappa who was making his 
first bid for public office by a landslide to set the stage for a 
gubernatorial bid in 1992 rappa is challenging carpers actions in

rappa 66 a millionaire developer and onetime contributor to 
carpers campaigns engaged in namecalling and accused carper of 
becoming a millionaire while in congress 
in a direct mail leaflet concerning the savings and loan 
industry scandal rappa said carper was wined and dined while 
taxpayers were being robbed of 500 billion referring to the 
estimated cost of the savings and loan bailout 
he criticized carper for accepting about 150000 in campaign 
contributions from financial institutions including about 9000 
from savings and loans 
carper a member of the house banking committee defended his 
efforts in the savings and loan bailout he attempted 
unsuccessfully to recapitalize the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp by tripling savings and loan insurance premiums 
rather than using taxpayers money 
carper said the primary challenge resulted from spite 
last year he led an effort to oust new castle county democratic 
party chairman eugene t reed sr who has since been indicted on 
charges of political corruption 
reed backs rappa 
when i led the effort to reform the democratic party to throw 
out the old leadership i knew there would be a price i had to pay 
for doing so carper said this primary is payback that i had 
anticipated 
carper said he wanted to win by a large margin because a close 
victory would send the wrong kind of signal and message to those 
who might like to take our party back to the old days of 
smokefilled rooms closed doors and deals under the table

the bush administration reiterated in a 
supreme court court brief friday that the 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion should be overturned but it stopped short of asking the 
justices to do so in pending cases involving new york city family 
planning clinics 
the justice department stated its wellknown views on the 
landmark roe vs wade decision in a brief filed to defend reagan 
administration regulations that prohibit governmentfinanced family 
planning clinics from providing abortion counseling 
the regulations promulgated by the department of health and 
human services in 1988 have been challenged by family planning 
clinics planned parenthood and other organizations 
the brief filed by solicitor general kenneth starr said we 
continue to believe that roe was wrongly decided and should be 
overruled 
the supreme courts conclusions in roe that there is a 
fundamental right to an abortion and that the government has no 
compelling interest in protecting prenatal human life throughout 
pregnancy find no support in the text structure or history of the 
constitution starr argued 
but the justice department stopped short of asking the court to 
use the two cases before it as the occassion for undoing roe vs 
wade instead the justice department offered a narrow defense of 
the 1988 regulations 
the executive director of the national abortion rights action 
league seized on the brief as an occasion to emphasize its concern 
about the nomination of david souter to the court which it said 
should be opposed if souter does not recognize a right to abortion 
this is direct evidence that there is reason to fear judge 
souter said kate michelman the administration must feel 
confident they will soon have the votes to overturn roe 
the national right to life committee on the other hand said it 
was glad the administration had presented a firm principled 
defense of unborn babies 
the clinics are financed under a 200 million a year program 
under title 10 of the public health service act the law forbids 
the clinics from performing abortions but earlier regulations had 
allowed counselors to advise women that terminating a pregnancy was 
an option 
the court is considering two cases from new york city in which 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the 1988 regulations 
on a 21 vote but some other federal appeals courts have ruled the 
regulations were unconstitutional 
the justice department disputed the petitioners claim that the 
regulations violate the constitutional protection of freedom of 
speech the grant recipientss employees as a matter of the 
employment relationship are obligated to comply with the grant 
recipients directions the department said 
thus any limitation on the employees freedom of expression 
arises from their voluntary decision to enter a particular 
employment relationship nor do the regulations infringe on the 
right to abortion that is recognized by roe vs wade said the 
department 
while under roe the government may not prohibit a woman from 
choosing to have a first trimester abortion this court has 
repeatedly held that the government is not obligated to provide the 
means to exercise any such right the department said

burmas military government which ignored 
mays election landslide for the opposition announced friday it 
had arrested the acting opposition leader and five other key 
dissidents 
col than tun deputy chief of military intelligence said six 
leaders of the national league for democracy were arrested 
thursday they included its acting leader kyi maung and his 
deputy chit hlaing 
gen saw maungs government put the leagues two main leaders 
aung san suu kyi and tin oo under house arrest in july 1989 tin 
oo was later sentenced to three years in jail at hard labor 
on thursday japanese diplomats reported that saw maung told a 
visiting japanese legislator last week he was willing to free ms 
suu kyi if she accepted foreign exile or gave up politics 
thursdays arrests deprive the league of the leaders who steered 
it to victory in the may 27 national election burmas first free 
poll in three decades the league won 392 of 485 contested seats 
but the military has ignored its demands to transfer power 
in washington state department spokesman mark dillen said we 
strongly deplore continued arrests by the burmese military regime 
on political charges 
he said the united states regarded the arrests as an attempt by 
the military to stifle legitimate political activities and thwart 
implementation of the may election results 
the government has issued warnings recently against protests to 
mark the anniversary of the militarys seizure of power in 
september 1988 at that time troops killed several thousand people 
in crushing a national movement for democracy 
at a news briefing friday saw maung repeated the warnings he 
also ordered buddhist clergy who have been at the forefront of 
recent antigovernment dissent not to meddle in politics 
the government is ruling the country according to martial 
law our duty is to maintain law and order and any attempt to 
disrupt these objectives will not be tolerated he said 
western diplomats in rangoon have reported a heavy troop 
presence in the capital in recent days one diplomat contacted by 
telephone from bangkok gave two possible explanations for the 
latest arrests 
one is that they are preemptive the other that they are a 
deliberate ploy to stir up unrest to create an excuse for an even 
heavier clampdown he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
both kyi maung and his deputy are members of the leagues 
central executive committee both won parliamentary seats in the 
may election 
than tun said they were detained under the official secrets act 
and would be tried soon he gave no details of the alleged offenses 
however the diplomat said the pretext for the arrests appeared 
to be that the two had circulated to regional league leaders a 
confidential letter written by the powerful head of military 
intelligence maj gen khin nyunt 
the four others arrested thursday were from mandalay burmas 
second largest city ohn kyaing thein tan ye myint aung and sein 
hla aung were accused of instigating unrest there on aug 8 the 
anniversary of a 1988 general strike 
the us human rights group asia watch said in an august report 
that thousands of political prisoners were believed to be held in 
burmese jails and that torture was widespread 
on aug 8 troops reportedly killed two buddhist monks and two 
students who were demonstrating peacefully in mandalay days 
earlier a soldier reportedly bayonetted a student protester in the 
face 
kyi maung a retired 72yearold army colonel was considered a 
moderate with the potential to mediate between the military and the 
more radical members of his own party

the unions at the new york post conditionally 
agreed friday to yield 17 million in concessions that the post 
says it needs to stay in business through next week 
the unions said they believed the post needs concessions and 
agreed in principle to negotiate them they also asked for and got 
an outside audit of the posts books and urged the paper not to 
change its contracts with labor 
we are going to do everything possible to help the post stay 
in business said george mcdonald president of the allied 
printing trades council an umbrella group for unions at the 
tabloid if we happen to fail neither side is going to blame the 
other 
post spokesman howard rubenstein said changing the contract 
would not be necessary as long as the newspaper got economic relief 
we continue to be optimistic that working with our unions will 
lead to a resolution he said 
on tuesday post publisher peter s kalikow said the paper was 
running an annual deficit of 25 million to 27 million and that he 
needed the unions to kick in 17 million in concessions or the 
paper would close by sept 15 
if the unions are satisfied with a weekend audit by peat marwick 
main amp co negotiations could begin monday or tuesday any cuts 
would be effective for the life of the current contracts which 
expire march 30 
since tuesday the unions have been meeting with post officials 
learning what each group would have to sacrifice 
the newspaper guild which represents 337 reporters editors 
sales and clerical workers was asked to take a 30 percent pay cut 
and drop about 40 jobs from its jurisdiction union members said 
guild president barry lipton said the pay cut actually amounted 
to a 46 percent cut a 30 percent cut a 2hour increase in the 
work week equalling an 11 percent cut and a 5 percent hike in 
workers outofpocket health costs 
at a raucous membership meeting thursday night 300 members 
unanimously rejected the package as obscene and degrading 
lipton said 
michael alvino president of the drivers union said his union 
was asked to take 8 million in cuts or 54 percent of its payroll 
the largest hit asked of any union he said the post asked for 
personnel cuts and slashed overtime 
after assessing the proposals each union was given the allied 
met friday with daniel f cremins post executive vice president 
and richard t nasti vice president lipton said the 40job 
jurisdiction cut was dropped 
the unions told cremins and nasti that they too wanted certain 
concessions in order to negotiate 
aside from peat marwicks audit and the contract remaining 
intact the unions also want stock in the post and at least one 
seat on the board of directors said theodore kheel an unpaid 
legal adviser to the unions 
i think the post will agree to this there was no violent 
reaction at fridays meeting when the items were brought up 
kheel said 
kheel said they wanted the stock and board seat because they 
would expect the new york times which is financially healthy to 
seek concessions equal to any the unions give the post 
kheel said it would in effect block the times from asking for 
concessions since the times is unlikely to place any union members 
on its board

lt gov martha griffiths resumed her 
criticism of gov james blanchard on friday by hinting her 
replacement on the democratic ticket is unqualified 
griffiths said in an interview for face to face with connie 
chung on cbs news that olivia maynard 54 of flint had no 
experience as an elected official 
i dont know what she knows about government griffiths 
said she has never been in the government except for this 
running the office of services to the aging 
the 78yearold griffiths also criticized her boss when asked if 
she thought he was hiding behind a womans skirts by offering 
maynard for a network interview rather than himself 
well he always wants somebody else to take the blame for 
everything she said but everybody else does and hes real 
good at this at letting somebody else take the blame he takes the 
credit every politician does that if they can every politician 
griffiths was dumped from the ticket after blanchard decided she 
was unable to step in and take over the governors duties at a 
moments notice 
she reacted bitterly to the decision at first then seemed to 
make up with the governor in a visit to mackinac island mich 
last week where she kissed him and then walked arm and arm with him 
she also told him at that meeting that she was not referring to 
him directly when she said the worst thing about politics is that 
some son of a bitch will dump someone after getting what he or 
she wants 
griffiths is widely credited with helping blanchard 48 to his 
first gubernatorial victory in 1982 
maynard is a former chair of the michigan democratic party and 
has been director of the state office of services to the aging 
since 1983

a snipers rooftop suicide before hundreds of 
transfixed onlookers was captured by cameras friday and local 
pittsburgh newscasts did not air the videotape while national cnn 
headline news did 
paul fisher a pittsburgh man in his mid to late 30s used a 
rifle and handgun to keep police at bay for 5 hours before 
shooting himself in the head and falling from atop a 16story 
building 
the citys three networkaffiliated television stations wtae 
wpxi and kdka did not broadcast their footage of the suicide 
we have a stationwide policy regarding suicides we dont 
broadcast them and that applies to this case said kdka 
executive news producer jocelyn howe more so in this case 
footage lent nothing to the telling of the story 
thats not our style we dont do things like that here 
said tom loebig executive producer of news at wpxi i dont feel 
anyone taking their own life should be shown on television 
in 1986 pennsylvania state treasurer r budd dwyer killed 
himself at a news conference he called to discuss a federal 
indictment against him 
wpxi which has since changed management broadcast videotape of 
dwyer placing a gun in his mouth and firing 
kdka and wtae broadcast parts of the news conference but not the 
suicide 
at wtae news director joe rovitto told the pittsburgh 
postgazette it was against station policy to broadcast suicides 
before fisher died rovitto said weve alerted everybody that 
if he makes a move that looks like hes going to jump to get the 
camera off him immediately even if its a sloppy pan 
the station broadcast a freezeframed image of fishers hat in 
the air during his fall 
the three stations cable news network and the cnn headline news 
broadcast live reports from the scene throughout the day 
headline news a division of atlantabased turner broadcasting 
system broadcast videotape of the suicide 
the reason we did it is that we were covering the story when 
it first broke and we were continuing to tell the story said meg 
andre a supervising producer at headline news 
the station aired the suicide once every hour friday evening and 
planned to reduce that overnight she said 
cnn received the same footage but saw no reason to run it 
said supervising producer david bernknopf no one other than the 
gunman himself was harmed it didnt make sense to run it 
saturdays editions of the pittsburgh postgazette included a 
frontpage photograph of fisher tumbling from the apartment 
building 
we may get some mail on this said david guo staff 
development editor 
the associated press transmitted two photographs one showing 
fisher falling and the other showing him holding a rifle as he 
stood on the buildings edge 
at the pittsburgh press editors intended to meet late friday to 
decide on photo coverage of the suicide in saturday afternoons

a union boss accused of ordering the 1981 deaths 
of two union activists who opposed philippine dictator ferdinand 
marcos pleaded innocent friday to two counts of aggravated 
firstdegree murder 
constantine tony baruso who earlier was found liable for 
millions of dollars in damages in a civil lawsuit filed by the 
victims families said nothing but his name during the hearing 
before king county superior court judge frank sullivan 
a pretrial hearing before judge james bates was set for sept 24 
baruso a prominent member of the seattle philippineamerican 
community and a longtime ally of marcos who died in exile last

offices june 1 1981 baruso was the union president when the two 
were killed 
besides their union work the men opposed marcos who as 
president imposed martial law 
king county prosecutor norm maleng said prosecutors hoped to

marcos friend in san francisco to kill the activists

convicted of the murders at a criminal trials in 1981 and 1982 
authorities identified barusos handgun as the murder weapon 
but said he claimed the gun had been stolen

revealed during the trial of a civil lawsuit filed by the victims 
families 
a us district court jury last december awarded the families 
151 million from marcos estate and from his widow imelda 
us district judge barbara rothstein later found baruso and 
malabed liable for an additional 84 million

americans are getting to the point where they 
will have no other choice but to cut public and private spending 
and who knows maybe even taxes 
as the economy slows the strains and the pains are showing up 
in the form of bank and savings and loan failures personal and 
business bankruptcies late and often incomplete repayments 
everywhere and in government budget deficits 
recognition that spending must be supported by income was a long 
time coming because government business and individuals had 
myriad ways in which to avoid facing the facts there were lots of 
ways to hide 
the federal government for instance simply tossed certain 
costly items off the budget business kidded itself into believing 
sales would soar and enable it to pay off junk bonds and 
individuals discovered easy credit 
the latter also discovered the bankruptcy laws and utilized 
them purdue universitys credit research center reports that the 
number of filings for personal bankruptcy in 1989 was 35 times the 
filings of a decade ago 
pastdue real estate loans at banks climbed 32 billion in the 
apriljune period corporate junk bond defaults so far this year 
total 94 billion or 600 million more than all of last year 
state governments are in deep trouble 
even massachusetts gov michael s dukakis who once suggested 
his colleagues lacked courage in seeking to avoid spending 
increases has been forced to cut 
the biggest blow to state budgets is the economic decline which 
has cut deeply into revenues but if it werent for higher tax 
rates the deficits in many states would be higher still 
state tax revenues in fiscal 1989 rose nearly 20 billion to 
284 billion a 75 percent oneyear jump according to the tax 
foundation to a great extent those tax increases had hidden the 
problems until the downturn 
and now with economies receding outrage against high taxes is 
growing 
the foundation study showed state tax collections from personal 
income last year rose 107 percent from corporate income 104 
percent and from sales tax 73 percent still the financial 
problems persist cuts are inevitable 
now that individuals governments and businesses seem to have 
few additional places in which to hide from reality several other 
factors may have turned against them 
interest rates for example may remain stuck at fairly high 
levels because the tenuous mideast situation could deprive the 
federal reserve of ratecutting options that same mideast problem 
could create higher energy prices add to domestic inflation and 
conceivably add to the federal budget deficit 
evidence of budgetary strains are everywhere credit as a 
percentage of individual income is near record highs debt has 
replaced equity in thousands of companies corporations are forced 
to cut down on employee benefits 
still economists who have observed the developing strains do 
not view the situation as hopeless 
a good many of them say the renewed sense of reality is the 
first step toward putting the financial house in order and that 
without more orderly finances any future upturn would be endangered 
in that sense the inability of americans to find any more 
financial deceits to hide behind might in the long run be good

sam raimi has this thing about monsters 
take king kong so what if the great ape gets fresh with fay 
wray and bumps off several others as the movie ends in gorilla 
warfare from the top of the empire state building raimis hoping 
the big guy comes out unharmed 
there was something fascinating about king kong on the empire 
state building said the filmmaker who has a surprise hit with 
the comichorror film darkman 
when they began shooting him i thought dont hurt him he 
just wants to be loved to be understood i was fascinated when 
they were able to terrify me with a character and then make me feel 
sympathy for him you had something that youre repulsed by and 
attracted to at the same time 
so raimi asks forgiveness for the title character of 
darkman a monstrous looking fellow beyond the pale of love and 
plastic surgery liam neeson stars as dr payton westlake an 
affable young scientist whose face is scarred beyond recognition by 
a gang of vicious hit men 
initially all westlake wants is a reunion with the woman 
frances mcdormand he has asked to marry but his anger brings out 
the beast in him making darkman dangerous to villians and 
amusement park vendors alike turning his life into a publicity 
campaign that asks who is darkman 
this is a story about a man who was handsome and becomes 
physically and emotionally a hideous man raimi explained 
darkman is just a comic book character but we did try to show 
him as a man who wanted to be loved and wanted to be accepted 
because of his growing alienation and frustration dealing with 
rejection by the woman who loves him the fact he continously 
failed thats why he becomes a bad character as opposed to just 
the way he looks 
who is sam raimi hes a native of royal oak mich who began 
making films at age 11 and collecting comic books much sooner he 
has thousands of them outside of the three stooges and jerry 
lewis he didnt watch movies as a kid so darkman is not 
simply a takeoff on horror films but also a personal statement 
about beauty and selfesteem 
all men at times think theyre the ugly ones he said 
maybe theyre rejected because theyre so hideous im sure ive 
been in a role like the darkman you consider yourself ugly and are 
frustrated with your failure and feel low about yourself 
i understand the loneliness aspect and rejection aspect 
after graduating from high school he planned on studying film 
but was encouraged by his father to major in literature and history 
instead he attended michigan state university dividing his time 
among shakespeare ancient greece and the rise and fall of modern 
moviemaking 
my brother ivan and i created a film society the michigan 
state university society for filmmaking he recalled it was a 
mechanism by which we could show our movies on campus and charge 
125 per ticket 
that was the best training i ever had kids were vocal and 
would shout out this sucks they didnt know the filmmaker was 
running the projector and the star was taking the tickets 
two years of college were more than enough for raimi who 
dropped out in 1978 for a life of busing tables and plotting 
stories 
the evil dead a lowbudget horror film came out in 1982 
overseas and 1983 in the united states and the sequel the evil 
dead ii dead by dawn was released in 1986 in between raimi 
made crime wave which the director dismissed as not very 
good 
he began writing darkman three years ago submitting a 
30page story to universal pictures the studio liked the idea and 
suggested to raimi he get a screenwriter to help flesh out the 
story 
we hired chuck pfarrer who wrote the original script for 
navy seals which i liked very much i said chuck heres the 
story would you be interested he wrote the first script then my 
brother wrote the second third and fourth 
twelves drafts were needed before everyone was satisfied raimi 
and four others share screenplay credits and the directors 
friends filmmakers joel and ethan coen offered advice and jokes 
comparisons to batman and dick tracy are inevitable but 
raimi was more interested in the comic strips than the films 
watching a movie doesnt have to be different from reading the 
funny papers he figures thats why he carefully strung the sight 
gags together making darkman a comic phantom story that pumps 
a little life into biff bam and pow 
comic books approach each frame that mostly clearly depicts 
the action and is their most dramatic representation of the action 
i took a similar appraoch when i directed darkman even at the 
cost of losing reality or drama or melodrama he said 
i wanted to keep the audience jumping laughing keep them 
entertained

the writer trekked into a remote valley of the 
golden triangle drug region to meet the man us officials describe 
as one of the worlds main narcotics traffickers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they say i have horns and fangs opium 
warlord khun sa declared with a laugh curling fingers at his 
temples to illustrate actually i am a king without a crown 
they are american narcotics officials who indeed describe 
khun sa in devilish terms like the prince of darkness they say 
he is one of the worlds main drug traffickers exporting death 
from opium poppy fields and jungle laboratories that refine the 
sticky extract into heroin 
his kingdom is a large slice of the golden triangle the 
triborder area of burma laos and thailand where khun sa has been 
an often dominant and ruthless figure for three decades 
the 56yearold survivor of battles imprisonment and 
doublecrossing deals boasts that he controls 80 percent of the 
drugs in burmas shan state khun sa also claims his ultimate aim 
is to eradicate narcotics which flow by the ton to what he 
describes as the drugcrazed west 
american officials citing evidence of his involvement in 
largescale heroin shipments to the united states indicted khun sa 
in march and threatened to go after him if he can be located 
going after khun sa would appear difficult but his location is 
no more secret than was that of gen manuel noriega the panamanian 
strongman and alleged drug trafficker ousted and captured by us 
military forces 
khun sas headquarters is in a long idyllic valley about nine 
miles inside burma astride a road leading from the thai frontier 
the few reporters invited to visit receive a friendly reception 
after a grueling 11hour mule ride 
ho mong is neither the stereotype of a smugglers lair nor a 
plush hideaway like those of latin american cocaine lords it 
includes an orderly village of several thousand people schools an 
87bed hospital a large buddhist temple and tiger camp where khun 
sas muang tai army is trained 
the world sees me in a different way he said in an 
interview khun sa wants the world to view him as a rebel general 
fighting the burmese government to liberate the shan one of many 
ethnic minority groups suffering under an autocratic regime 
with a motley group of shan and chinese khun sa has built a 
nonmilitary organization they claim has won the loyalties of 
several million people in shan state it includes a constitution 
modeled on that of the united states and several political organs 
the most powerful led by khun sas uncle khun seng 
he clearly commands the loyalty of many shans in burma and 
across the border in thailand but has a poor record of fighting 
the burmese government which he described as the great enemy 
in fact he has been on its side in the past and is shunned 
today by the karen kachin karenni and other rebel ethnic groups 
khun sa acknowledges taxing opium that moves through his 
territory but denies refining it or trafficking in heroin western 
and thai narcotics sources say his empire includes laboratories 
along the thaiburmese border and inside laos 
the opium warlord argues that for 17 years he has proposed 
that the west buy the opium harvests he gathers and cooperate with 
him to eradicate the drug problem at its roots there have been no 
takers 
we have the opium we have the heroin said seng joseph one 
of khun sas aides were the only ones who can stop the flow 
the dea cannot stop it in a hundred years he said of the 
us drug enforcement administration 
several us officials have visited khun sa over the years and 
he recently sent a videotape to president george bush 
it urges bush to accept what khun sa presents as a sixyear plan 
to eradicate narcotics and turn the povertystricken golden 
triangle into a world garden of allweather roads tourist 
hotels international airport and prosperous peasants who no longer 
must grow opium for survival 
it was midmorning at tiger camp lingering mists swept the 
surrounding hills as khun sa inspected recruits on the training 
field he was dressed neatly in light blue trousers and a striped 
white shirt 
when asked if he was wealthy khun sa said his expenses were too 
high especially for the army 
shan state is like a lawless state he said the people 
who own more guns have the power 
he claims to have 20000 men under arms most of them teenagers 
from peasant families who apparently are happy to join up for the 
monthly pay of 150 baht the equivalent of 6 us estimates place 
his armed strength at just under 10000 
khun sa was in an expansive jocular mood shouldering a 
recoilless rifle for photographers and giving soldiers tips on 
firing a 60mm mortar 
beneath the swagger were signs of anxiety he admitted all was 
not well in his domain 
a day earlier reinforcements from tiger camp had marched out to 
face the wa in a monthslong conflict over an important smuggling 
corridor to the thai frontier 
wa tribesmen once fought the government under the burma 
communist partys banner but now are muscling in on khun sas 
territory with government help the new arrangement is typical of 
the triangles shifting alliances and bloody rivalries 
the wa are not khun sas only worry 
because of the us indictment there is pressure on the thais 
to cut links indispensable to him thailand is khun sas major 
source of supplies and weapons and aides say he has built a 
network of relationships with thai businessmen officials and 
military officers 
khun sa scoffs at americas showcase war on drugs directed 
by what he describes as incompetent dea agents but admits to 
having tightened security he travels in a pickup truck mounted 
with a machine gun accompanied by six bodyguards carrying 
battlefield weaponry 
if the americans put me into custody they will have to feed 
me he said whats the use the poppy cultivation will just go 
on and on 
analysts generally agree getting rid of khun sa would merely 
leave a temporary vacuum that other warlords would fight to fill 
they also agree with his assessment that the opium trade is 
flourishing the us government estimates burmas opium output 
doubled to 2600 tons from 1988 to 1989 
western officials say that mountain of narcotics is the core of 
khun sas organization not the shan nationalism he professes

editors one of the latest crazes for thrill seekers bungee 
jumping has reached australia to find out what the fuss is about 
an associated press reporter took the plunge 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they wait their turns in a special area 
some sit quietly alone a few stretch muscles or pace nervously 
on the patch of artificial grass others chat boisterously with 
friends who came to watch have jumped already or plan to go later 
all steal glances at the oversize rubber bands to which they 
will entrust their lives will they prove thick enough when 
suddenly there is nothing below the feet but shallow water and 
your body plunges toward it 
this is bungee jumping the sport of pumping adrenalin pounding 
heart and an unlikely blend of cold fear and wild exhilaration 
cameras click and whir second thoughts skitter across a few 
faces when two candidates decide after looking down from a steel 
cage suspended 140 feet in the air by a crane that bungee jumping 
is not a good idea after all they forfeit their 69 55 us 
black clouds roll in a rainstorm suspends operations as gusty 
winds buffet the cage making it sway nerves tense and minutes 
drag by then the skies begin to clear and below the yacht 
pennants droop 
jumpers are weighed to determine which of several cords will be 
used to stop the fall 6 to 8 feet above water 
ankles are strapped snugly into heavy fabricandvelcro 
bracelets that are attached to each other with a loop for the long 
cord the other end is hooked to the bottom of the cage 
what bravado there was seems to continue until the jumper is put 
into the cage with two crew members secured with a seat belt and 
the crane begins lifting it 
on the way up the jumper is coached in what to do on the way 
down how to overcome fear and get the most from the jump the 
spiel also seems designed to give the mind a focus and keep terror 
away 
if you look down and start to get scared look at the 
horizon one crew member suggests put your toes on the edge of 
the cage then on our signal jump 
sounds simple but a glance at the water below dries the mouth 
and churns the stomach the height looks great enough from the 
ground but the concept of 140 feet changes drastically with the 
new perspective 
in parachuting the ground is so far down as to seem unreal 
here its easy to pick out details the people look like ants the 
yachts moored nearby are unfriendly shoals 
a crewman unstraps the seat belt and opens the gate the cage 
moves in the breeze before theres too much time to think and 
freeze theres a count of three two one 
bungeeeeeeee 
suddenly there is nothing below but shallow water and the body 
hurtles downward the adrenalin that had started the heart pounding 
now pours in 
the queasy stomach seems to be left up there somewhere and the 
weightless sense of free fall sets in just before the cord 
stretches stretches and then ends the dive 
it contracts again then relaxes contracts like a rubber band 
and the jumper gets a feel for manipulating the bounces like a 
yoyo or someone on a reverse trampoline 
by the time the cage and the jumper are lowered to the ground 
the initial fear has been replaced by disappointment that it is 
over a crew member grabs dangling hands and leads the body to a 
soft landing on a padded platform 
some of the spectators applaud as the anklets are removed the 
jumper stands a bit unsteadily and turns his attention to sorting 
out the sequence and feelings of the last few moments 
another jumper is strapped into the cage 
the roots of bungee are in pentecost island part of the vanuatu 
chain in the south pacific every may when the yams are ready to 
be harvested young males go through a manhood ritual by jumping 
from a homemade tower with vines attached to their ankles 
the lowest platform is 30 feet and the highest more than 120 as 
men gain stature in the village they move up to higher platforms 
inauguration of the hightech version is credited to the 
dangerous sports club of oxford university in britain members 
dressed in tuxedos among them graham chapman of monty python made 
several jumps from bridges about a decade ago including san 
franciscos golden gate 
in 1987 new zealander aj hackett made headlines when he and a 
friend hid on the eiffel tower overnight and plunged through the 
open center from the second level a height of about 360 feet 
hackett brought bungee jumping back to new zealand and 
commercialized it thousands of people take the plunge there each 
year and in january at auckland the commonwealth games featured a 
demonstration 
a few of the comparatively rich and famous have given it a try 
including boxer jeff harding rugby star wally lewis and singer 
deborah harry who went topless 
john fahey industrial relations minister of new south wales 
state delayed the sydney operation for three months because of 
health concerns then gave the goahead to what he called 
gluesniffing for yuppies 
one fatality and a serious injury have been recorded in new 
zealand france where there were three deaths in 1989 recently 
introduced regulations

new novels by gabriel garcia marquez john 
updike ann rice and stephen king should make for brisk sales this 
fall but publishers and booksellers worry a recession could turn 
many buyers into browsers 
the publishing boom of the past decade may be the problem net 
sales in the united states jumped from 14 billion in 1982 to 34 
billion in 1989 and some worry the industry has become too big for 
its own good 
in the past we were recessionproof said david schwartz a 
retailer for 31 years and president of the harry w schwartz 
bookshop which owns six stores in the milwaukee area 
but since our last recession in 1982 weve expanded our book 
publishing beyond that core population we have more than doubled 
the buying public and we have a lot of new people whose commitment 
to books is a lot more fragile 
the horrible truth is if you want to play in the sandbox you 
might get sand thrown in your eyes said brigitte weeks editor 
in chief of the book of the month club but the larger the 
sandbox the better there cant be any such thing as too big a book 
industry 
i think i pretty much share the concerns about the economy 
said stephen rubin president and publisher of doubleday co 
theres a general feeling were in a recession but there are 
certain books i hope will be recessionproof 
fiction looks strong this fall with alfred a knopf leading the 
way this is the publishing houses 75th anniversary and marquez 
updike rice and geoffrey wolff all have books coming out new 
writers nicholas shakespeare and walter kirn may also attract 
favorable attention 
i think we have five or six selections from knopf on our 
list weeks said its the most ive ever seen in the two years 
ive been here we usually have at most two or three by one 
publishing house we try to swing around 
the general in his labyrinth is the latest novel by marquez 
the nobel prizewinner whose previous works include the 
bestselling love in the time of cholera and the classic one 
hundred years of solitude based on the life of latin american 
revolutionary simon bolivar the general in his labyrinth is 
being published this month 
harry rabbit angstrom was last seen cradling his grandchild 
at the end of rabbit is rich updikes pulitzer prizewinning 
novel published 10 years ago he was also operating a thriving car 
dealership and had moved into a new home with his wife janice 
now in rabbit at rest rabbit has heart trouble a second 
grandchild and a condo in florida this is the conclusion to 
updikes acclaimed rabbit series which began in 1960 with 
rabbit run and was followed a decade later by rabbit 
redux the new book is due in october 
rice author of the popular vampire chronicles a trilogy that 
includes interview with the vampire the vampire lestat and 
the queen of the damned has a new book in november called the 
the witching hour the books story of a woman descended from 
witches who saves a drowning man covers four centuries and runs 800 
pages 
publishers like to present their best foot forward in the 
fall explained barbara morrow coowner of vermonts northshire 
bookstore 
i think this year will be strong i dont think its unusually 
strong but itll be a good fall there are a number of strong 
titles the john updike the jean auel garcia marquez 
other major books include kings four past midnight and t 
coraghessan boyles east is east both published by viking 
larry mcmurtrys buffalo girls and fiction by allende jm 
coetzee muriel spark and nadine gordimer plains of passage 
the fourth book of auels popular earth children series will be 
published by crown in october 
i think itll be great said lou haggerty a buyer with the 
tattered cover in denver which at 40000 square feet is one of the 
countrys largest bookstores i think theres something for 
everyone but i didnt see anything that i thought was a 
blockbuster 
among nonfiction books simon amp schuster inc will be heavily 
promoting ronald reagans autobiography an american life 
scheduled for a november release doubleday will cap the baseball 
season with bo jacksons bo knows bo and simon amp schuster has 
just issued preston sturges the autobiography of the late 
director 
civil war readers will have several books to consider 
the civil war an illustrated history is a companion 
volume to the ninepart pbs series scheduled for the end of this 
month geoffrey c ward whose biography of franklin d roosevelt 
won him the 1989 national book critics circle award wrote the text 
along with ric burns and ken burns five historians contributed 
essays and the book contains more than 500 photographs 
the library of america is issuing memoirs by two civil war 
generals ulysses s grant and william tecumseh sherman 
lincoln on democracy is an anthology published by 
harpercollins of the presidents speeches writings and 
conversations new york gov mario cuomo contributed an 
introduction and will help publicize it 
schwartz criticized the nonfiction list as very weak and 
said it continues a trend of the past years 
serious nonfiction is expensive to do you need long lead 
times and you have to support the author doing research 
schwartz said 
publishers are looking for a quick return and less expensive 
commitment to the books major publishers are simply not 
willing to put out the kinds of dollars it would take to do these 
books 
bill shinker senior vice president and publisher of the adult 
trade division at harpercollins insisted the commitment to 
nonfiction books was still strong 
were willing to make investments and allow writers the time 
to do books shinker said this fall we are publishing ronald 
haymans biography of marcel proust and that took four years 
were also doing a complete revision of rogets thesaurus 
an investment the previous management didnt want to do it will be 
about four years in the making 
bernard rath executive director of the american booksellers 
association dismissed criticism of current books as based on the 
idea that in the good old days everything was better more 
publishing houses means writers have more places to go rath says 
and that means more opportunities for solid writing of all kinds 
weeks also defended the quality of the fall list and thinks 
sales will be strong she notes the publishing industry survived 
the 1982 recession and will probably do fine this time theres 
always the chance of a slump she says but the publishing industry 
may still be the safest part of the sandbox 
ive developed the following comfortable scenario weeks 
said people come to the conclusion its cheaper to stay at home 
with a book theres a certain reality with books thats not 
associated with restaurants or movies or the theater books have a 
different niche in the consciousness

after katherine baker finishes telling 
the tale of her escape from the middle east an awkward silence 
spreads across the gymnasium bleachers at central catholic high 
any questions come on no one has any questions katherine 
asks looking out at the teenage audience wilting in the late 
summer heat 
katherine sees the kind of wideopen midwestern faces she her 
brother and sister knew as students in this rural city about an 
hour northwest of indianapolis 
she is trying to reach them with images of kuwaits modern 
downtown its ancient gold souks the arabic peoples warmth 
telling these students about that foreign faraway life is all she 
can do now 
because that life as if a mirage is gone 
like her brother bill baker katherine lost everything on aug 
2 when saddam husseins troops crossed from iraq into kuwait she 
awoke on that day to the sound of artillery she since has slept 
fitfully if at all 
for the bakers this international crisis is a personal crisis 
but more than the financial stability and treasured possessions 
lost they are mourning and fighting for what kuwait was to them 
shes making the middle east real for the kids said steve 
eddy a social studies teacher at central catholic some 
americans feel the hostages deserved to be victims the kids have 
asked what americans were doing there anyway 
katherine 37 was a retail manager happily settled in a house 
near the sea after 3 years in kuwait she finally had made a home 
for her two wrinklefaced pups artwork antiques and other 
souvenirs collected over a decade living abroad 
bill who was on vacation in france when iraq invaded was a 
contractor and consultant in kuwait in the middle east hed found 
a place to start anew after divorcing his wife 11 years ago he was 
financially welloff enjoying a porsche and 42foot sailboat hed 
cultivated an international circle of friends and an understanding 
of arab culture 
that country is a little gem said bill 40 his ruddy and 
animated face momentarily wooden but its gone that life my 
loves my boat my baby mug 
the bakers have lost their touchstones they now live nowhere 
and own next to nothing a pair of sneakers some jeans a few 
photos whatever katherine stuffed into her hastily packed bag 
suddenly these independent world travelers have come home to 
bunk with their middle sister sarah or maybe with their widowed 
mother in springfield ill 
young americans have never known war and studies indicate 
would likely have trouble finding kuwait which is one fifth the 
size of indiana on a map and yet since summers calm was 
shattered they have heard daily reports on americans held hostage 
and soldiers deployed in the middle east 
be aware know the world and that it is very small today 
katherine urges the kids at her alma mater i wouldnt be here if 
it werent for my kuwaiti friends 
the first student tentatively raises a hand then more follow 
with questions they want to know was kuwait a democracy or a 
dictatorship what exactly are american troops over there to 
protect would she live there again 
katherine is grabbing their attention with a real story about 
how accepting people with a different religion looks or culture 
saved her life 
she is talking both about the european friends with whom she 
toughed out the sieges first days and about the natives who helped 
her to safety after 12 days in hiding 
at great risk a kuwaiti family shed never met before and may 
never see again brought katherine and her german boyfriend 
disguised in traditional black religious robes along in their 
caravan across the desert 
iraqi troops twice turned the fourjeep convoy back at the 
citys outskirts before the group navigated a route out under the 
deserts 120degree sun her kuwaiti allies never flinched 
the group stopped only briefly during their fourhour dash 
once to pick up a disoriented and dehydrated arab whose car had 
broken down hours earlier the second time to free a jeep stuck in 
the sand 
i saw a lot of abandoned cars a lot and thats sad 
katherine said i know a lot of my friends their families have 
died 
katherine crouched in the jeeps rear wedged between gas cans 
and her trembling dogs 
two weeks before things were fine i was living a normal 
life katherine said then all of a sudden youre running 
through the desert with a dog hugging you 
when katherine finally reached the saudi border she was not 
elated too many people had been left behind along with the baby 
photos letters and other possessions of a lifetime 
i feel a great debt to those people said katherine running 
a hand through the hair she cropped short after friends reported 
iraqi troops were raping women i owe them my freedom 
bill too feels an allegiance his friends who helped 
katherine escape now are penniless and frozen out of their 
homeland weve got to build back he said when the doors 
open well be ready 
bill plans to organize a group of contractors technicians 
computer specialists and others to go in and rebuild when kuwait is 
freed as he is sure one day it will be katherine plans to work 
with the coming home committee a group based in champaign ill 
that is working to help hostages and their families 
brush it off get on keep busy says sarah 38 a professor 
of radiologic technology at indiana university her indianapolis 
home is a refuge for bill and katherine whose spirits are 
bolstered by seeing uncle bob eating corn on the cob sailing and 
other hallmarks of childhood summers 
but the bakers cant wipe their slates clean and begin fresh in 
the united states they have brought something of kuwait back with 
them and are sharing it with whomever is willing to listen 
a whole country has been robbed and raped katherine said 
but crying about it doesnt do anything but bring everyones 
morale down 
added bill we just have to pick up the pieces start over 
again

bond defaults recession fears and explosives 
piling up near some of the worlds largest pools of oil helped junk 
bonds earn their nickname last month 
august was one of the worst months on record for the risky 
bonds according to indexes compiled by analysts who watch the 
market 
salomon brothers incs highyield market index had a total 
negative return of 387 percent in august and merrill lynch amp 
cos highyield index posted a total negative return of 383 
percent 
the stars were aligned just right last month said joseph c 
bencivenga director of highyield research at salomon 
highyield bond issuers were defaulting at an annual rate of 58 
percent in the first half of the year the highest in 20 years 
according to moodys investors service inc also many economists 
believe the economy is headed for a recession or already in one 
which could accelerate defaults 
threat of war in the middle east and higher oil prices has 
pushed down bond and stock markets since iraq invaded kuwait aug 
2 investors fear higher inflation that could result from the sharp 
increase in oil prices 
if theres any good news in the junkbond markets poor 
performance its that the market performed as expected in light of 
world events said martin fridson head of highyield research at 
merrill lynch 
in a general way it should mirror the trends in other 
markets he said 
the 30issue dow jones industrial average for example fell 10 
percent in the month and the broader standard amp poors 500 index was 
off 9 percent in august its worst month since october 1987 
as a result of the slumping junk market new issues have slowed 
to a trickle 
given the lackluster tone in the market today the investors 
have taken a waitandsee attitude bencivenga said 
last week stone container corp a chicagobased paper and 
packaging company canceled plans to peddle 200 million worth of 
new junk bonds on a tour around the country arnold brookstone 
chief financial officer at stone container said the issue was 
postponed until the market improves 
the derth of investors willing to put their money into the junk 
market has forced issuers to offer higher yields for some the 
yields are apparently too burdensome to warrant selling the notes 
the shortage of new issues has also spilled over into the more 
secure investmentgrade market bondweek a trade publication last 
week reported that three frequent debt issuers with strong credit 
ratings wanted to sell threeyear notes at around 9 percent in the 
last week in august 
investment bankers however warned them away from the market 
the newsletter said quoting unidentified syndicate and corporate 
officials 
without any major developments in the middle east the next bit 
of news that could have a profound impact on the junkbond market 
is the commerce deparments release this friday of retail sales 
figures 
it should be flat if it comes in above or below that the 
price of highyields could jump up dramatically or see further 
deterioration bencivenga said

what a difference a year makes for investors in 
airline stocks 
as summer 1989 drew to a close shares of leading airline 
companies were soaring along at record highs and the industry was 
brimming with takeover plans and rumors 
today many of these same stocks are virtually grounded beset 
by recession worries and the surge in oil prices 
over the 12 months through the end of august the dow jones 
index of airline stocks suffered a decline of 5449 percent 
ranking 79th in a field of 82 groups 
during that span the air carriers barely edged their beleagured 
cohorts in the homebuilding hotel and eastern banking businesses 
to stay out of last place in the stockmarket performance derby 
consider ual corp which traded as high as 294 last year as a 
group mapped plans for a 300ashare buyout of the company last 
week the stock hovered around 92 
amr parent of american airlines has tumbled over roughly the 
same span from 107 to 45 and usair from just under 55 to around 
17 
at delta air lines the ride was not quite so bumpy with the 
stock down only about 35 percent from 85 to 55 or so 
the airline group has been directly in the line of fire of just 
about every unsettling development that has hit the stock market 
over the past year from the collapse of the takeover boom to the 
showdown in the middle east 
the first blow came oct 13 of last year when a group putting 
together a planned acquisition of ual disclosed that it was having 
trouble lining up financing for the bid 
that set off a shock to investors confidence that drove the dow 
jones industrial average down 190 points in what was billed as a 
minicrash 
efforts persist to devise a new buyout plan involving united 
airlines employees management and outside investors 
even before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 of this year airline 
stocks suffered further damage as oil prices crept upward and talk 
of a recession spread then when the crisis hit in the persian 
gulf and the oil market skyrocketed the industrys fortunes took 
another abrupt drop 
the same factor that has created a panic in the broad market 
is working overtime on the transports and its easy to see why 
says stephen leeb in his investment advisory letter indicator 
digest 
transportation companies are among the nations largest 
consumers of oil so higher oil prices escalate operating costs 
reducing margins and higher airline rates reduce overall passenger 
travel 
paul nisbet an analyst who follows the group for 
prudentialbache securities put out a sell recommendation 
after the iraqi invasion 
we expect the jump in jetfuel prices and slowing traffic due 
to a sluggish economy to cut earnings for the major airlines 
dramatically he said in a subsequent report 
with all the negatives weighing on the industry however some 
analysts say the time may soon be ripe to look for bargains among 
these depressed stocks 
given expectations earlier this year of higher oil prices leeb 
said weve been bearish on the transports but enough is enough 
as long as america is in business there will be a need for 
transportation in fact as the world continues to become more 
integrated economically the need for transports will increase

how to make something worth nothing worth 
something 
the soviet union is trying to turn its practically worthless 
ruble into an internationally accepted currency and the task is 
putting the worlds leading economists to the test 
so far the verdict is that making something of value of the 
bills that carry the hammer and sickle wont be easy but its an 
essential step on the soviet road toward the modern economic world 
rubles are worth nothing outside the soviet union because the 
government has refuses to back them with hard currency gold or 
silver tourists are allowed to take only a few rubles into or out 
of the country and even that was prohibited until recently 
this has insulated the ruble from the ups and downs of world 
money markets but has reduced moscow to conducting much of its 
foreign trade as barter trading stolichnaya vodka for pepsicola 
for instance the government sells its precious natural resources 
to earn foreign currency 
as soviet economists debate how to establish a marketdriven 
economy they are increasingly aware of the need for a convertible 
currency 
president mikhail s gorbachev and boris yeltsin president of 
the russian republic have proposed separate plans for quick change 
to a market economy 
transforming the ruble will be complex 
to begin with a rubles comparative worth is unclear the 
government maintains two official exchange rates that allow 
foreigners to buy a ruble for either 159 or 16 cents depending 
on the nature of the transaction 
the second rate available only to tourists is widely regarded 
as more accurately reflecting the rubles real value said ed 
hewett an economist at the brookings institution in washington 
making the ruble freely convertible would allow the world market 
to determine its worth but that could bring substantial pain to 
soviet consumers said jeffrey sachs a harvard university 
economist who has been an architect of polands shock therapy 
economic reforms 
soviet citizens have an extraordinarily high savings rate 
because there is little for them to buy and subsidized prices of 
many staple goods are artificially low 
according to sachs if the ruble became convertible overnight 
people would have a large amount of money to spend on western goods 
the classic money chasing goods form of inflation 
that could create inflation so severe that the government might 
fall said josef brada of arizona state university 
sachs suggested the danger of inflation could be lessened by 
having the government simultaneously double prices and wages 
effectively reducing the potential strength of savings 
raising prices is the least popular element of proposed economic 
reforms however and plans for a gradual change to convertibility 
have been put forward 
brada led a panel of experts that proposed a fivestep plan last 
year in the first phase some hard currency would be made 
available at auction for state enterprises to buy with rubles 
the auction would gradually be broadened to include 
cooperatives private enterprise and joint ventures after that 
households would be allowed to own foreign currencies and 
foreigners would be given the right to exchange their currencies 
for rubles at a rate determined by the market 
in august the government said some businesses would be allowed 
to trade rubles for hard currency at a market rate beginning next 
year as a step toward making the ruble convertible 
brada said his stepbystep approach would protect consumers 
from the first volatile days of convertibility and act as a 
whip to drive industry 
he said soviet industries that produce the best products and 
would have the best chance in world markets are probably the 
richest in rubles and in the best position to buy large amounts of 
hard currency 
they could use the hard currency for successful foreign 
ventures and inefficient factories without the rubles to buy hard 
currency would fall aside 
if convertibility accomplishes anything it reallocates 
resources from inefficient to efficient industries brada said 
proposals with many of the same concepts but in different 
sequences were among the winners of a suggestion contest sponsored 
by an american philanthropist this year in those proposals 
creation of an efficient marketoriented economy is seen as a 
necessary precursor of convertibility 
hewett one of the contest judges said the soviet union must be 
able to offer a range of products that is broad and deep enough 
to compete on the world market before the ruble becomes fully 
convertible 
otherwise he said rubles would be spent on foreign goods and 
the soviet union would have no way of earning hard currency 
to that brada added that having a healthy manufacturing base is 
better support for a currency than gold reserves 
gold is readily indentifiable but the value of a 
currency in international terms is the countrys ability to 
export he said 
after determining how to make the ruble convertible the soviet 
government would have to consider the extent to which it was 
prepared to intervene in the exchange market buying rubles with 
gold or foreign currencies to support the ruble if its price 
started to fall 
my suspicion is that the soviets would do a lot of 
intervention brada said psychologically they have a strong 
preference for stability 
in the initial stages convertibility will be just a look at 
what the ruble can do in various activities brada said 
if it cant do much winners of the convertibility competition 
wont have to worry the prize money was in dollars 42000 of them

is it an economic crisis yet or still just 
political 
that was the question on business minds as the persian gulf 
standoff dragged through its fifth week 
the financial markets hit hard when iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
have tried to reach an uneasy peace with the mideast situation but 
oil prices resumed their climb during the past week causing 
periodic retreats in the stock market 
while panic has largely subsided the threat of calamity 
remains a crisis resolved peacefully would have mostly political 
consequences a war might spell economic disaster 
experts likened the markets current conundrum to the strain of 
past war scares a headline in forbes magazines sept 17 edition 
screamed remember the maine in reference to the markets 
performance after saboteurs blew up a us battleship in havana 
harbor in february 1898 
the market lost about 16 percent of its value within a month of 
that incident but then rebounded strongly in a socalled 
sighofrelief rally 
some would argue the markets have already heaved their sigh this 
time about two weeks ago and are getting jittery all over again 
thats the other lesson of history observers pointed out even 
after shaking off political fears the markets may be hit by a 
second wave of worries over the longer term economic impact of a

if the economic crisis theory holds the markets may be in for 
even tougher sledding 
the signals dispatched from the economic front during the week 
were mostly discouraging unemployment rose from 55 percent in 
july to 56 percent last month retail store sales auto sales and 
manufacturing were all sluggish in august 
among the reports the manufacturing outlook may have been the 
most disappointing the national association of purchasing 
management said its index of business activity fell to 470 percent 
from 474 percent in july a reading below 50 percent is bad news 
for the economy 
the unemployment report which came at weeks end added insult 
to injury some observers said the worst part wasnt the increase 
in the jobless rate that was expected more depressing was the 
idea that the increase might not be bad enough to prompt an 
emergency rescue of the economy by the federal reserve 
in the shadow of rising oil prices and inflation the job 
picture didnt appear to warrant a quick move by the fed to loosen 
credit

in just a few days opec marks its 30th 
anniversary but with one of its founding members occupying 
another there is little to celebrate 
its a birthday but not a happy birthday said peter bogin 
associate director for oil markets at cambridge energy research 
associates in paris 
they can celebrate their survival thats all they can 
celebrate said pierre terzian editor of the parisbased 
newsletter petrostrategies 
the sept 14 anniversary of the founding of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries will pass with little fanfare no 
ceremony is planned at its headquarters in vienna some countries 
may issue commemorative stamps hold news conferences or otherwise 
mark the day 
but as it enters its fourth decade opec is in crisis 
a little more than a month ago iraq invaded and occupied its 
tiny neighbor kuwait in a dispute over oil wealth the united 
states launched a massive military buildup in saudi arabia another 
opec member also in the oilrich persian gulf an international 
embargo was slapped on iraqi and kuwaiti crude pulling 4 million 
barrels of oil a day off the market 
with tensions running high opec appears to have given up 
exerting control over its members a majority of nations recently 
agreed to throw out temporarily the cartels output quotas to allow 
as much pumping as possible they intend to make up most of the 
shortfall of banned iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
what we have done is put opec to sleep until the crisis is 
over said sheikh ali khalifa alsabah the finance minister for 
kuwaits governmentinexile and its former oil chief 
terzian argued that by suspending its quota system the cartel 
has abdicated its role of market leadership to western nations 
it is no exaggeration that the price of oil in the coming 
months will be mainly determined by what the americans want he 
said 
in recent years the organization had worked hard to adopt an 
attitude of cooperation not confrontation with western countries 
that are the key consumers of its product demand for opecs oil 
grew supplies were abundant and prices were generally good 
but with iraqi president saddam husseins lightning strike 
against his neighbor years of hard work vanished 
opecs reputation has been badly tarnished said bogin 
the wests impression is that the cartels oil is in the the 
hands of very belligerent unstable countries he said 
the outcome of the crisis will determine the cartels future 
and iraqs power to dominate the group and push for higher pricing 
policies 
if saddams annexation of his neighbor holds iraq will gain 
additional oil reserves and eliminate opecs main dove kuwait 
which had fought for lower prices 
western countries fearful of iraqs muscle might rush to find 
other fuels to replace oil in running their economies 
but saudi arabia and others could refuse to accept the 
annexation of kuwait creating a permanent split in opec iraq and 
libya stayed away from the cartels latest meeting 
if on the other hand iraqs power is weakened saudi arabia 
and others will emerge in a stronger position and likely pursue 
more moderate pricing policies in the future analysts said 
despite the critical situation few are ready to predict the 
cartels imminent demise 
opec member countries are slaves to oil and therefore they 
need opec said terzian 
he was referring to the heavy dependence of the groups members 
on crude exports to get badly needed money for their economies 
some of which have rung up heavy debts with western nations 
its not the end of opec by any means said john lichtblau 
chairman of the petroleum industry research foundation in new york 
opec has been a fairly important organization in influencing 
world oil prices it will continue to play a role in the 1990s 
he said 
with little publicity 30 years ago five key oilproducing 
nations saudi arabia venezuela iran iraq and kuwait banded 
together in baghdad iraq and set up a group to fight for higher 
prices 
qatar indonesia and libya joined soon after the ranks were 
filled out by the united arab emirates algeria nigeria ecuador 
and finally gabon altogether the countries hold about 
threequarters of the worlds oil reserves and pump about onethird 
of its oil 
in its early years the cartel attracted little attention some 
say only ridicule from the major oil companies which controlled 
crude prices then 
it wasnt until the 1970s that consumers took notice 
an arab embargo on crude supplies to the united states for 
helping israel in the 1973 arabisraeli war sent oil and gasoline 
prices skyward 
crude prices again surged approaching 40 a barrel when oil 
production from iran fell after the 1979 revolution the price 
shock sent the world economy into a tailspin 
in the 1970s and 1980s opec kept prices higher than they 
would have been otherwise said lichtblau 
opecs main function he said has been to regulate its members 
production so there is not too much oil on the market for the 
demand of the united states and other consuming nations 
opec is irrelevant while there is a world oil shortage he 
said it is designed to keep members from overproducing and 
driving prices down 
but its regulating mechanism hasnt always worked 
earlier this year crude prices plunged mostly because of 
overproduction by kuwait and the united arab emirates which 
persistently ignored their opec supply quotas and flooded the 
market with crude 
the fall in prices touched off saddams wrath he complained his 
country had lost 14 billion in oil revenues over the past year 
because of low prices and he threatened to use force against 
countries ignoring their opec quotas 
a few weeks later his troops rolled into kuwait

as the debate keeps raging over whether the 
united states faces a recession or not many wall street investors 
are resigning themselves to a long wait for a clearcut answer 
naturally there is an abundance of opinions among analysts on 
the subject of whether the economy is or is not headed for its 
first certified period of declining business activity since 198182 
but so far hardly anybody on either side of the argument has 
found sufficient evidence in the economic statistics or in the 
unsettled world political situation to proclaim a verdict 
many analysts see no reason to expect that stalemate to be 
broken any time soon given such imponderables as the eventual 
outcome of the crisis in the persian gulf and that uncertainty 
looms as a particular problem for the stock and bond markets 
there are no two ways about it investment decisions will 
continue to be made in an environment of great unease about the 
middle east said robert brusca chief economist at nikko 
securities international in new york 
in theory at least the unsettled stock market would get a big 
boost if the chances seemed to increase that a recession could be 
avoided and prospects for corporate profits could somehow brighten 
conversely undisputed signs that a recession was at hand would 
stand to bolster the market for high quality bonds and thus foster 
hopes for a decline in interest rates 
but events arent giving much encouragement to the bulls in 
either marketplace as witness the labor departments monthly 
report friday on employment 
the figures which showed an increase in the civilian 
unemployment rate from 55 percent in july to 56 percent in 
august painted a picture of continuing weakness in many important 
sectors of the economy 
at the same time however they did not seem to present a bleak 
enough image to stir any immediate response by the federal reserve 
to relax its credit policy 
the stock market is presumed to dislike this kind of neithernor 
environment worse than just about anything else indeed some say 
the outlook for stocks might actually start to improve once the 
existence of a recession were confirmed 
these observers reason that some of the best market rallies 
begin in the depths of recessions as interest rates fall and 
investors begin to anticipate a recovery to come 
in the past week stock prices bounced around erratically in the 
absence of any such inspiring visions the dow jones average of 30 
industrials closed friday at 261955 up 519 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 145 to 17751 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market slipped 
83 to 38038 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 38 at 32377 
volume on the big board averaged 11574 million shares a day 
against 12788 million the week before 
james stack publisher of an investment advisory service called 
investech says stocks face a volatile environment over the next 
year fraught with both danger and opportunity 
past experience shows he adds that its only after the smoke 
clears and final economic statistics are compiled that it becomes 
apparent we were already in a recession long before it became 
headline material 
not one of the past four recessions was forecast in advance by 
a poll or group of economists

manville corp has agreed to inject up to 520 
million over seven years into an asbestos trust fund to reverse a 
cash shortfall jeopardizing compensation payments to tens of 
thousands of victims 
the agreement is the first step toward meeting more than 130000 
pending and untolled future claims by people who contracted lung 
cancer and other respiratory ailments inhaling fibers from 
manvillemade asbestos 
the cash infusion which would not begin until late 1991 at the 
earliest is part of an overhaul ordered by a federal judge after 
the trust ran out of cash and said it would not meet new claims 
until well into the 21st century 
asbestos is a mineral that can cause cancer when its fibers are 
inhaled compensating asbestos disease victims and their families 
is the biggest product liability issue in us history with cases 
clogging courts nationwide many victims have died before receiving 
payment 
us district judge jack b weinstein who ordered the manville 
trust restructuring in august froze all payouts except in 
emergency health cases attorneys involved in the negotiations said 
they expected some form of a payment freeze to remain until the 
trust receives the new manville money 
that would delay even longer payments to many victims or their 
families some of whom have waited more than a decade for 
compensation from denverbased manville and other asbestos 
manufacturers 
the manville personal injury settlement trust was created as 
part of manvilles 1988 bankruptcy court reorganization the trust 
faces a 30 million deficit by march 31 1991 and officials have 
blamed the drain on more claims and bigger settlements than 
expected 
attorneys said negotiations are continuing on a plan expected to 
result in paying manville trust claimants based on the severity of 
illness and financial need rather than the date of filing a group 
of judges also is trying to fashion a nationwide solution to 90000 
pending lawsuits involving the trust and dozens of companies that 
made asbestos 
the new payments by manville will be made as special 
distributions to all common stockholders manville will turn the 
trusts convertible stock into common stock giving the trust about 
80 percent of the companys 120 million outstanding common shares 
compared with about 50 percent today 
the trust then would receive 80 percent of a maximum total of 
650 million in special distributions to be made over the next 
seven years or 520 million 
the first 100 million payment would be made on dec 1 1991 or 
after the final payment plan is approved by weinstein whichever is 
later another 100 million would be pumped into the trust one year 
later with 40 million infusions in each of the following two 
years 
in the fourth through seventh years the trust will receive an 
annual distribution based on manvilles performance up to a 
maximum 240 million 
but manville cautioned that all payments after the initial 100 
million would depend on the companys ability to secure financing 
through bonds and other sources in the financial markets 
under the bankruptcy court reorganization insurance payments 
and company contributions made the trust initially worth about 3 
billion manville still is required to make regular cash payments 
into the trust and pay 20 percent of its profits annually starting 
in 1992 as part of the original plan 
manville was not required to contribute to the trust overhaul 
and is legally shielded from further liability for asbestos health 
claims but the companys future success also depends on putting 
the asbestos issue behind it 
the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1982 
because it couldnt meet mounting asbestos claims 
manville chief executive tom stephens said the new agreement 
is a good balance between directing cash to all of our 
shareholders and reinvestment in our businesses 
he said the extra payments were not expected to hurt the 
performance of the company which makes a variety of building and 
engineering products including fiberglass industrial insulation 
and paper and wood products 
manville stock rose 75 cents to 675 in afternoon trading 
friday on the new york stock exchange 
the trust to date has settled close to 24000 claims for more 
than 1 billion but has paid out only about twothirds of the 
amount payments have averaged about 43000 per claim compared to 
an initial estimate of 25000 
in addition judges have been harshly critical that about 
onethird of payments have gone to pay lawyers fees weinstein 
last month restricted contingency fees to plaintiffs lawyers to 20 
percent of all hardship settlements 
asbestos which has natural heat resistance and insulation 
properties was used widely for decades in shipbuilding and other 
construction industries companies have been held liable on the 
grounds they failed to warn workers about its potential hazards

employees cheered when ernie 
fleischer walked in the front door of franklin savings association 
after winning it back from federal regulators in a bitter court 
battle 
just six hours later an appeals court forced him out again 
regulators moved back in 
and even thursdays events wont be the end of the roller 
coaster ride for the oncetiny franklin which boomed in the 1980s 
on a complex investment strategy that the government now contends 
it mishandled 
im optimistic well win fleischer the thrifts chairman 
and the man credited with its growth said friday it will just 
take time 
franklin was seized feb 16 of this year by regulators with the 
office of thrift supervision attorneys contended the thrift used 
improper accounting tricks to avoid 119 million in losses from the 
futures market 
they ordered the bank to take the losses immediately which 
placed it below required capital requirements and triggered the 
takeover the resolution trust corp took control 
fleischer and other officers filed suit saying regulators had 
changed their accounting rules in midstream after a fourweek 
trial us district judge dale e saffels ruled wednesday that 
regulators had acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner 
fleischer and fellow managers regained control of franklin on 
thursday morning but six hours later the 10th us circuit court 
of appeals in denver granted the governments request for a 
temporary stay in the order until it can appeal 
regulators reseized franklin and fleischer walked out of the 
suburban kansas city branch office where he was visiting employees 
he cant go back for now franklins attorney roger 
stanton said friday they had a nice day yesterday and got to 
see some employees but thats that it was good for the employees 
to see ernie again 
on friday fleischer 57 was busy answering calls in the home 
office he has used since franklin was seized 
analysts say franklin which was founded in 1889 in the small 
town of ottawa kan was different than other thrifts in its 
operations about 10 years ago it began to move beyond the 
traditional sampl business of simple home loans and passbook savings 
accounts and sought out socalled brokered deposits in which 
depositors from anywhere in the nation ask brokers to seek out the 
highest possible interest rates 
it then used that money to buy mortgagebacked bonds and 
protected itself against resulting swings in interest rates by 
buying and selling futures contracts 
franklin operated in an entirely different way than just about 
any thrift i know said henry peltz an analyst with keefe 
bruyette and woods in new york they were not a lending 
institution they were an investing institution and ernie 
fleischer taught wall street a good deal about hedging 
franklins 114 billion in assets made it the 21st largest 
savings and loan in the nation a year ago and the largest in 
kansas more than 90 percent of those assets were in 
mortgagebacked securities 
fleischer a kansas city tax lawyer had acquired franklin in 
1972 with other investors although franklin kept its headquarters 
in ottawa he and his investment team worked out of an office 
building in this kansas city suburb 
rtc officials were back in those offices friday 
fleischer said he had time to do just a cursory examination of 
the thrifts books thursday before the governments reseizure but 
it appeared stable 
he said rtc agents have sold some assets and the thrift appeared 
to have lost between 400 and 500 million in deposits 
franklin also lost about 50 of its 350 employees but fleischer 
said hes optimistic the thrift would prosper if he regains control 
everyone i talked to yesterday was prepared to go back to work 
and build on what exists fleischer said there remains a very 
highly skilled and highly qualified group of employees

american businessmen at this years 
leipzig fair see bright times ahead as east germany converts to 
capitalism but soviet traders found far gloomier prospects 
because the berlin wall went down i thought the prospect of 
selling our wooden homes would be better than before and weve had 
quite a lot of success said orrelle trent president of 
blueberry hill cedar homes in california 
but a few buildings away from where the business center usa 
exhibition was housed the mood was tense at the soviet pavilion 
the introduction of the powerful west german mark throughout east 
germany following the economic merger of the countries july 1 has 
made it hard for the soviets to do business at the fair 
there are far fewer exhibitions because we have to pay for 
everything in hard currency explained vladimir krol a 
representative of elektrointorg a staterun electronics trading 
company 
the leipzig fair is an ancient trade meeting that since world 
war ii has been the showcase for products and technology from the 
communist countries of the soviet bloc 
the fair which traces its origins to 1175 developed in the 
middle ages as a main crossroads for metal trading in central 
europe 
its low point was in world war ii when the site was destroyed 
by allied bombing and the fair was closed but after the war the 
fair was revived into a major trading thoroughfare 
the democratic revolution that reversed communism in eastern 
europe and the unification of the two german states this year 
tempted many western businesses to try their hand at the event 
its part of our allaround strategy to move into eastern 
europe we came to leipzig to demonstrate that were serious 
said christian foster a senior representative of bell atlantic 
corp a regional telephone company 
things are different for the soviets whose pavilion seemed 
strikingly out of place amid showy outdoor exhibitions from 
mercedesbenz and shell oil co a huge bust of lenin stands sternly 
outside the massive concrete showroom which is topped with a red
