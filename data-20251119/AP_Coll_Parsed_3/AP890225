a gaping hole ripped open on the right side of a 
united airlines jumbo jet carrying 354 people friday sucking nine 
passengers to their death 20000 feet above the pacific ocean 
authorities said 
the pilot brought the boeing 747 back safely for an emergency 
landing at honolulu international airport two of the engines had 
failed but it wasnt clear whether the failure was connected with 
the fuselage ripping open 
he had to dump fuel and then fly the return to honolulu and 
land that plane safely we would characterize that as heroic 
lawrence m nagin a united senior vice president said at the 
airlines headquarters in chicago 
the honolulu medical examiners office said multiple small body 
fragments and pieces of clothing were found in the one of the 
rightside engines deputy medical examiner mary flynn said it was 
not known whether the fragments were from one or more bodies 
united said the missing passengers included six americans two 
australians and a new zealander 
twentyseven passengers were treated at hospitals and six were 
hospitalized including four united crew members 
federal aviation investigators had not determined the cause of 
the hole but were leaning toward structural failure as the 
likeliest explanation initial reports from the pilot and some 
passengers indicated they had heard an explosion 
all of a sudden i could see the sky and feel the wind said 
passenger koji yamamoto 23 of osaka japan the roof was 
breaking something was blowing toward us 
uniteds flight 811 which originated in san francisco and los 
angeles departed honolulu international airport with 336 passengers 
and 18 crew members at 134 am 634 am est for auckland new 
zealand and sydney australia it returned 59 minutes later with a 
10by40foot vertical hole in its right side near the front of the 
craft 
there is an area where there used to be a cargo door and its 
not there any more said eugene glenn special agent in charge of 
the honolulu fbi office but glenn said it was not known whether the 
loss of the cargo door was a cause of the accident or a result 
william speicher senior vice president for uniteds pacific 
division said at a friday night news conference that it appeared to 
him the hole started at the cargo door and ripped up 
the government last july ordered airlines to improve cargo door 
lock systems on older boeing 747s saying the directive was 
prompted by a lower lobe forward cargo door with damaged lock 
sectors that partially opened in flight the summary of the 
directive did not say what flight or what airline was involved 
united spokesman russell mack in chicago said the required 
improvements were made to the aircraft 
the nine missing passengers were identified as susan craig and 
harry craig of morristown nj rose harley of hackensack nj 
anthony fallon and barbara fallon of long beach calif mary t 
handley of bay city mich lee campbell of wellington new zealand 
dr john michael crawford and john swann both of sydney australia 
the most seriously injured of the five people hospitalized was a 
48yearold woman in guarded condition at queens medical center 
with cervical and abdominal injuries 
we still have no basis on which to discern whether the damage 
was caused by a bomb or whether it was structural damage caused by 
some internal failure said rep james l oberstar dminn 
chairman of the house aviation subcommittee after consulting with 
federal officials investigating the incident 
he said he thought the likeliest explanation for the damage 
was stress failure perhaps compounded by maintenance problems the 
ripping away of the fuselage skin appeared to have occurred along 
rivet lines he said 
bobbie mardis a federal aviation administration spokeswoman in 
oklahoma city said records from january 1987 showed united found 
cracks near the no 3 engine the structure that holds the engine to 
the wing the 18yearold plane is the oldest 747 in uniteds jumbo 
jet fleet 
mardis said the aircrafts history also included an engine fire 
in 1986 
but nagin said the craft underwent a fourday complete inspection 
88 days ago and a less intensive check on feb 16 
it has no history of maintenance problems this aircraft had a 
routine maintenance history nagin told reporters in chicago 
faa spokesman john leyden in washington said the pilot reported 
losing power in one rightside engine nine minutes after takeoff 
and after turning to honolulu eight minutes later radioed he had 
lost power in the other rightside engine 
united identified the pilot as david cronin 58 a 34year 
veteran who is based in los angeles 
the fbi sent bomb experts to the investigation but a 
determination of whether it was a bomb has not been made said fbi 
spokesman harlan frymire 
coast guard spokesman dennis hubbard said two search vessels 
picked up debris spotted earlier by helicopters he said a large 
piece of corrugated metal some small pieces and an aircraft seat 
cushion with an emergency procedures card attached were found in the 
pacific ocean about 90 miles south of honolulu none of the debris 
had been linked to flight 811 he said 
as far as i know there have been no bodies found by the coast 
guard said nagin 
speicher said about 200 of the passengers from flight 811 were 
expected to board a special united flight to new zealand on friday 
i crashed in world war ii twice and i kept flying you just 
have to said john c tracey of san antonio as he prepared to 
board the special flight

a traveling president bush and his republican 
allies in the senate are working out details of a plan to salvage 
john towers nomination as defense secretary and bush has already 
begun lobbying from abroad 
the plan includes the possible rare public release of material 
culled from an fbi report on tower although bush said in tokyo he 
was anxious to protect the confidentiality of the people who agreed 
to talk to investigators 
senate republican leader bob dole said friday the white house is 
hoping to assemble a sanitized version of the report so senators 
can discuss in public the allegations against tower and their 
disposition 
dole said the hope is to produce a list of the charges and 
hopefully a list of the rebuttals so the american people will know 
that charge a was answered and is gone charge b etc 
tower has been struggling in his nomination fight against 
allegations of excessive drinking as well as womanizing and against 
an alleged conflict of interest stemming from the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars he received for work as a defense industry 
consultant 
in addition bush who returns monday from a fourday asian trip 
intends to meet individually with 10 or more democratic senators 
many of them conservative southerners to seek their votes 
ill do it personally and ill do it as forcefully as i can 
the president told reporters 
he said i will encourage people to look at the facts despite 
the talk about perceptions of towers problems 
thats not fair enough and thats not high enough a standard 
when it comes to the confirmation of an important nominee of this 
nature said bush a personal friend of tower for decades 
so i have made some calls and i will be talking to whoever 
remains open minded he said among the democrats to be called was 
sen lloyd bentsen a fellow texan and former senate colleague of 
towers 
bentsen said friday he was still uncommitted 
towers confirmation battle suffered a major defeat thursday 
night when the armed services committee on a strict party line roll 
call recommended 119 that the full senate reject the nomination 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the full senate 
the partisan vote breakdown in committee heightened the dispute 
dramatically transforming it into a major test of the new 
republican presidents strength in a congress controlled by 
democrats 
among the democrats other than bentsen who said friday they 
remain uncommitted on the nomination were alabamas howell heflin 
and arizonas dennis deconcini the three are among the most 
conservative democrats in the senate and have been invited to the 
white house to meet with bush next week to discuss the nomination 
in his comments to reporters bush said there is no fallback 
there is no option and denied he was off to a late start with his 
personal lobbying its not too little too late 
the effort to release material gleaned by the fbis investigation 
is an attempt by republicans to prove their contention that despite 
the multitude of charges made against tower few if any can be 
corroborated 
release of the material would be a dramatic departure from the 
normal practice towers background check has been kept in a 
leadlined room on the fourthfloor of the capitol and senators are 
required to go there to read it 
in tokyo bush said confidentiality is vital but he added 
that senators should look at the report and make up their minds on 
the facts instead of perceptions 
with a full senate vote expected late next week dole gave a hint 
of the bruising struggle that lies ahead when he read for reporters 
high praise that sen sam nunn dga heaped upon tower shortly 
before the former texas senator retired from congress nunn is now 
chairman of the armed services committee and led the committee 
democrats in voting against confirmation 
dole also said a party line vote in the senate could be an end 
to the honeymoon for both georges that was a shot across the bow 
of sen george mitchell of maine the new majority leader 
but even as he said he hoped there was no party effort to line 
up every democrat against john tower he made it clear the issue 
is one of loyalty to the administration for the republicans 
this is the presidents first controversial vote and i think he 
has a right to expect all of us to support him he said

oliver l norths courier to central america 
says the former presidential aide told inquiring lawmakers the two 
were only acquaintances despite their extensive secret dealings to 
help the nicaraguan rebels 
robert w owen who ferried intelligence information and money 
from north to nicaraguan rebel leaders testified that he met with 
the former national security council aide 80 to 100 times between 
1983 and 1986 
but owen said north reported telling lawmakers in august 1986 
that he met me a couple of times 
he said i met you a couple of times i knew you were an 
activist supporting the nicaraguan resistance owen quoted north 
as telling him after being questioned by a congressional 
intelligence panel 
owen described during a day of testimony how he worked for north 
taking intelligence information tactical guidance and and sometimes 
money to the contra leaders in central america but he said north 
told a different story to congress 
among the 12 felony charges against north are allegations that he 
obstructed repeated congressional inquiries into reports in 1985 and 
1986 that he was secretly helping arm the nicaraguan rebels and 
giving tactical advice despite a congressional ban 
the former national security council aide and retired marine 
lieutenant colonel is accused of telling the house intelligence 
committee on aug 6 1986 that he was not assisting the contras and 
that owen was only a casual acquaintance 
rep lee hamilton the panels former chairman who was the first 
prosecution witness in the trial testified that north told the 
committee he was not assisting the contras by raising money that 
he had not provided any military advice to the contras 
owen 35 testifying under immunity from prosecution in the 
irancontra affair said that on three trips to central america he 
gave contra leaders intelligence maps that included locations of 
nicaraguan government troops and details of the managua airport for 
a suicide mission north proposed for destroying soviet hind 
helicopters 
later owen said he helped the contras open up the socalled 
southern front along the costa rican border traveling to that 
country at norths behest to survey possible sites for an air strip 
that was eventually built to help the supply efforts 
owen said delivered a secret encryption communications device to 
joseph fernandez the cia station chief in costa rica which allowed 
the sending of messages in code by telephone 
north was careful to keep owens role in the resupply operations 
a secret but later suggested a change in his role because it was 
time for me to look more legitimate he said 
in october 1985 owen went to work as a consultant for the state 
departments nicaraguan humanitarian assistance office as a 
consultant 
i was working in a covert operation owen said north felt 
it was a good idea that i be in a position that was more public 
that i not try to hide what i was doing 
owen said he assured north that despite his new role i would be 
in a position to help him 
north continued to seek owens involvement in the secret resupply 
network once asking him to fly to honduras aboard a plane carrying 
humanitarian aid that was to pick up a load of weapons for a secret 
flight to another dropoff point 
he said i would fly down on nhao put on my robert owen 
private citizen hat and fly with the ammunition owen testified 
when owen got to honduras there was no ammunition to be loaded 
owen said he never put norths name on a stream of memos he 
wrote referring to his mentor as hammer steel hammer or 
bg the initials stood for blood and guts 
the memos were signed with the initials tc to denote owens 
role as the courier 
as press reports linked owen to north owen wrote i am burned 
beyond belief 
north then decided in the summer of 1986 to help owen get a job 
with a nonprofit institute that studied terrorism owen said north 
helped arrange for a private donor to finance the job

budget director richard darman says the bush 
administration is ready to provide specific details being demanded 
by congress on president bushs budget as part of the negotiation 
process the administration is trying to get started 
darman told reporters friday that the administration has a 
position on the proper spending level for almost every one of 
the programs in the 136 billion collection of government agencies 
for which the administration is seeking savings of 10 billion 
democratic critics have charged that the administration purposely 
has left the savings in this area of nondefense programs 
unspecified so that congress will have to take the political heat 
for cutting popular domestic programs 
darman however denied this assertion and said that once the 
private negotiations with congress get under way in earnest the 
administration will be willing to state what its position is 
in order to get the process moving we will have to take an 
initial position darman said 
democrats in congress have insisted that they want the white 
house to put more details about bushs budget on the record before 
they enter into negotiations 
but darman said he believed this debate will soon move beyond a 
call for more specifics into serious negotiations with congressional 
leaders he predicted those negotiations would start within the next 
two weeks 
in a context where a lot of financial market players and 
other observers are nervous it is foolish to do business as 
usual he said in an hourlong meeting with reporters 
i think it will be virtually guaranteed that we will start a 
process that is helpful above and beyond the normal legislative 
process darman said 
darman met again friday with top democrats and republicans from 
the congressional budget committees as part of a series of sessions 
in which lawmakers have been seeking specific figures about the 
spending bush proposes 
in the meeting with reporters darman rejected the argument that 
bushs 116 trillion budget was based on a strategy that will allow 
bush to take credit for popular spending increases and blame 
congress for the painful cuts needed to meet the 1990 deficit target 
of 100 billion the administration estimates the deficit in the 
current fiscal year will be 170 billion 
taking note of the decision by the federal reserve board to boost 
its discount rate friday to 7 percent darman said the action should 
prod both congressional leaders and the administration to enter into 
serious negotiations to calm fears in financial markets of a 
stalemate that would keep federal borrowing demands from declining 
in congress rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house 
budget committee agreed 
panetta said the discount rate increase should serve as a 
wakeup call to lawmakers and administration officials showing 
the urgency of the need to cut out the political gamesmanship and 
adopt a bold and realistic budget plan 
darman disputed an argument advanced by senate budget committee 
chairman sen james sasser dtenn that democrats who support 
higher domestic spending than in the bush budget might be better off 
simply allowing acrosstheboard spending cuts to take effect 
these spending cuts would be triggered if congress and the 
administration fail to agree on a budget with a deficit of 100 
billion sasser said earlier this week that the automatic cuts would 
result in spending about 10 billion less than bush wants for the 
military and about 10 billion more for domestic programs 
however darman gave out projections from the bush budget office 
showing that discretionary domestic spending would be 41 billion 
higher under the bush budget than if the spending cuts take effect 
while defense spending would be 151 billion below the level in the 
bush budget 
everybody recognizes that automatic cuts are highly 
undesirable from the standpoint of defense and national security 
darman said

civil rights advocates are criticizing attorney 
general dick thornburghs choice of william lucas a black lawyer 
to head the justice departments civil rights division saying the 
key job needs someone with more experience 
were terribly disappointed said julius chambers the 
directorcounsel of the national association for the advancement of 
colored peoples legal defense fund 
lucas a democratturnedrepublican who ran unsuccessfully for 
the governorship of michigan in 1986 was recommended friday by 
thornburgh to president bush to become assistant attorney general in 
charge of the civil rights division 
currently in private practice in detroit lucas is a former new 
york city policeman fbi agent wayne county mich sheriff and 
wayne county executive he was born in harlem graduated in 1952 
from manhattan college and in 1961 from fordham universitys law 
school 
lucas 61 worked for the civil rights division in 19611962 
representing the justice department in tuskegee ala during the 
desegregation of the local schools the department said in 
addition he helped compile information on barriers to black voting 
material presented to congress during its consideration of the 
voting rights act of 1965 
if nominated by bush he would be subject to senate confirmation 
bill lucas has a longstanding commitment to the civil rights 
movement and a record of strong and fair law enforcement 
thornburgh said in a statement these factors i believe make him 
an outstanding nominee for the sensitive position of ensuring that 
the civil rights laws of our nation are equally and fairly 
enforced 
but thats not the way civil rights advocates saw it friday 
we had hoped that the attorney general would try to pick 
someone who had some experience with civil rights litigation and had 
some sympathy and appreciation for the struggle that black people 
have been going through over the years and that we would not be 
back with the same type of confrontation that weve had during the 
past eight years chambers said 
william taylor of the citizens commission on civil rights said 
lucas appears to have a little bit of civil rights experience but 
it seems to go back a long way before the enactment of major civil 
rights laws he doesnt have major identification among civil rights 
leaders and organizations as someone with a real background in civil 
rights 
that lucas is black did not allay any of his concerns he said 
were past the era i think when an administration earns 
plaudits simply by appointing a minority person to a job taylor 
said 
said ted shaw of the naacps legal defense fund office in los 
angeles just because hes a black republican doesnt mean hes 
qualified for this job 
bush has said he wants civil rights policy to be different from 
that followed by former president reagan whose civil rights 
division came under intense fire from civil rights groups 
william bradford reynolds who headed the civil rights division 
during the reagan administration helped formulate and direct the 
reagan administrations efforts challenging affirmative action 
hiring quotas he also moved to overturn courtordered busing 
programs and to restrict federal guarantees concerning womens 
rights and the rights of the mentally ill and disabled 
pat korten a conservative who served as justice department 
spokesman during the reagan administration said the choice of lucas 
was not only a good choice but its politically very smart 
i think it will please conservatives who have long thought 
highly of lucas and thought of him as someone who should be given a 
role of some prominence in a republican administration and somebody 
who can symbolize the partys desire to bring into its fold blacks 
with a strong lawandorder record he said 
the reaction from patrick mcguigan of the free congress 
foundation a strongly conservative group also was positive 
this is a brilliant appointment he said 
the only black who has ever held the civil rights division job is 
drew s days iii who was the assistant attorney general in charge 
of that division during the carter administration

the energy department has acknowledged publicly 
for the first time that it misjudged both the cost and relative 
urgency of hazardous waste cleanup requirements at its 15 nuclear 
weapons plants 
the miscalculations stemmed from a partially flawed computer 
model the department used to decide which of 156 environmental 
problems at the plants were most severe ray berube the deputy 
assistant secretary for environment said friday 
he told a house armed services subcommittee the cleanup will 
likely exceed the official 63 billion and the ranking of hazards 
will have to be revised the rankings are important because they 
help determine the timing and scope of environmental cleanup at the 
various sites which are owned by the energy department 
he said the rocky flats weapons plant near golden colo which 
was judged the most urgent priority for environmental cleanup in the 
preliminary december report probably will get a lower ranking when 
the final survey is completed later this year he did not say which 
site might replace rocky flats at the top of the list 
he also did not say by how much the cleanup cost at the 12state 
nuclear weapons complex would exceed 63 billion 
berube said the errors were caused in part by haste since his 
agency decided to speed up its orginal timetable for assessing the 
environmental problems because of public pressure to explain how the 
wastes would be cleaned up 
we did not have the time to subject that computer model to a 
public review berube said i wish we had the model does need 
some improvements 
the department says none of the waste including toxic organic 
compounds such as methylene chloride and radioactive gases such as 
tritium poses a threat to public health and safety but that it 
might if it is not cleaned up soon 
an environmental organization the natural resources defense 
council testified at the house hearing that the computer model was 
riddled with flaws and that in some cases the department made up 
data used in the model when the information was not readily 
available 
jim werner an engineer with the council said the computer model 
was incapable of indicating which environmental problems should be 
addressed in the next few years compared to those that will need 
attention several decades from now 
given the serious flaws in does rankings the departments 
proposed cleanup budget is also highly suspect said dan w 
reicher an attorney for the environmental group 
berube said it was not yet possible for the department to make a 
firm estimate of cleanup costs for the weapons plants because not 
enough is known about the extent of damage to the environment caused 
by four decades of bomb making 
theres a strong chance that these costs will go higher than 
63 billion he said adding that projected costs would rise as more 
information about the scope and nature of soil and groundwater 
contamination becomes available 
key elements of the weapons complex including parts of the 
savannah river plant in south carolina the hanford reservation in 
washington state and the rocky flats plant in colorado have been 
closed down in recent months because of safety and technical 
problems

vice president dan quayle says many of the 
changes occurring in the soviet union and among its communist 
neighbors can be traced to the profound impact of the defeat of 
soviet forces in afghanistan 
in a speech friday night to the conservative political action 
conference quayle said look at hungary where the seeds of 
political pluaralism seem to be sprouting 
look at poland where the government is negotiating with 
solidarity 
look at the ferment of the baltic states 
and look at the new outspokenness throughout the soviet union 
itself 
he then asked can it be just a coincidence that all these 
remarkable events are taking place at the very same time that the 
soviet union is reeling from its defeat in afghanistan i think 
not 
the vice president also used his speech to try and assure 
conservative activists often at odds with george bush that the new 
president would follow in the path of ronald reagan 
those who think that the george bush who served at ronald 
reagans side for eight years who worked with him to turn this 
country around will somehow change colors now that hes president 
those people couldnt be more mistaken said quayle 
the revolution of low taxes a strong defense less regulation 
support for freedom fighters and a commitment to moral values that 
began in 1981 will continue under the leadership of george bush 
into the 1990s he added 
but quayle stopped short of giving the conservatives one pledge 
they want a commitment the administration will seek military aid 
for the contra rebels fighting to overthrow the leftist government 
of nicaragua 
he quoted bush as pledging support for the contras and said 
were going to do what has to be done were going to have to 
see if nicaraguan leader daniel ortega means what he says about 
free elections 
and if he does not the people of nicaragua will continue their 
fight for freedom and they will deserve our support 
but the only specific support he mentioned was for humanitarian 
aid 
were going to insist on the continuance of humanitarian aid to 
keep the contras alive he said

a jury has been picked and sent home for the 
weekend pending opening arguments monday in the trial of suspected 
hijacker fawaz younis 
the case tests a 1984 law giving the united states jurisdiction 
in incidents involving american hostages abroad 
us district judge aubrey robinson jr asked prospective jurors 
whether they had ever been victims of air piracy or had any links 
with the middle east 
about half the 57 prospective jurors stood up when asked whether 
any had heard of the case in which younis allegedly led a band of 
armed men that seized a royal jordanian airliner in beirut in june 
1985 no one was killed in the hijacking 
the jury plus four women alternates went home for the weekend 
under strict instructions from robinson to discuss the case with no 
one including your preacher and to avoid media coverage of the 
trial 
in september 1987 younis was arrested by federal agents who 
lured him to a twomasted sailing yacht off the coast of cyprus in 
the mediterranean sea with the promise of a drug deal and a party 
according to pretrial evidence and documents 
younis was transferred successively to a navy ammunition ship 
the uss butte and a carrier the uss saratoga then flown nonstop 
to andrews air force base near washington 
the statute under which younis is being tried was passed in 1984 
to give the united states jurisdiction in cases involving american 
hostages abroad domestic hostagetakers have been convicted under 
the statute but no one besides younis has been charged with an 
overseas hijacking and prosecuted under it 
the chief prosecutor assistant us attorney ramsey johnson 
told the court he planned to call as witnesses six fbi agents two 
navy doctors and four passengers from the jetliner 
defense attorney francis d carter said he would call as 
witnesses two federal agents and helena cobban a scholar on the 
middle east he indicated during a pretrial hearing wednesday he 
will call younis to the stand 
younis 29 a shiite moslem from lebanon faces life imprisonment 
if convicted 
bearded with brown hair and brown eyes younis appeared in the 
courtroom wearing a light gray sweater and a tie throughout the 
proceedings he smiled and joked with an arablanguage translator 
supplied by the court 
the defense counsel said at a pretrial hearing he would argue 
that his client seized control of the airplane under orders from the 
amal militia to which he belonged the amal is a shiite moslem 
faction in lebanon 
evidence against younis includes a videotape of him on the tarmac 
at beirut airport announcing that the boeing 727 aircraft would be 
blown up no one was killed in the 39hour ordeal which ended when 
the airplane was destroyed after being evacuated 
during the trial expected to last at least two weeks federal 
officials will be seeking to limit disclosure of details of the 
elaborate clandestine operation in which younis was captured

jurors deliberated 19 minutes before rejecting a 
confessed burglars claim for damages against a man who shot him 
during his getaway 
we felt we shouldnt reward a burglar jury foreman vernon p 
reeves said after the decision was announced in dade county court 
the lawsuit was brought by 19yearold fordiran gonzalez against 
jack b lentz who lived next door to the scene of an august 1987 
burglary in miami lentz fired three warning shots one of which hit 
the fleeing gonzalez in the back 
the bullet tore through gonzalezs intestines and went out his 
side the resulting medical bills totaled 8622 
gonzalez admitted taking part in the burglary and pleaded no 
contest to charges in juvenile court he was ordered to serve 200 
hours of community service 
the youth hung his head in silence when the lawsuit verdict was 
read thursday 
i wish theyd at least paid the bill he said 
but judge philip bloom said he thought the jurors reached the 
right conclusion 
this is a case of chutzpah he said this case highlights 
our mixedup world in which the admitted criminal seems to have 
more rights than an innocent victim this jury verdict affirms 
that a burglar is not entitled to safe passage during and after the 
commission of that crime 
lentz was originally charged with aggravated battery and culpable 
negligence after the shooting while the charges were later dropped 
he said 17 months of criminal and civil court battles have raised 
second thoughts about pulling the trigger 
if confronted again by burglars lentz said id have to think 
twice about what id do i dont know if id get involved

the united air lines 747 that lost nine 
passengers when a cargo door and section of fuselage blew away over 
the pacific ocean was one of a group of older boeing jets under 
order to modify the lock system on their cargo doors 
failure of the door was one of several possibilities 
investigators were exploring today as cause for the gaping hole in 
united flight 811 when it returned to honolulu after taking off on a 
flight to auckland new zealand 
other possibilities included structural failure an engine 
problem that sent parts flying into the fuselage or a bomb 
a july 1 1988 airworthiness directive from the federal 
aviation administration gave airlines with 156 of the early jumbo 
jets from 30 to 90 days to conduct inspections and any necessary 
repairs depending on the type of door lock they have they were 
also given from 18 to 24 months to make modifications to improve the 
door lock system 
united public relations officials did not return a call late 
friday to inquire whether the damaged airliners cargo doors had 
been inspected or whether the ordered alteration had been made on 
that or other united 747s the airline would have had at least 
another 10 months to make the improvement 
united spokesman lawrence nagin said earlier the airliner had a 
routine maintenance history 
the 18yearold plane is the oldest 747 in uniteds jumbo jet 
fleet and the 89th 747 built by boeing which has produced 712 of 
the aircraft in various versions since 1969 
a boeing spokesman randy harrison said the united plane had 
57793 flying hours and 14849 takeoffs and landings that involved 
pressurizing the cabin we dont consider those high numbers he 
said 
a 14member national transportation safety board team was 
conducting investigation into the cause with assistance from the 
faa united boeing and the fbi 
the july faa directive was prompted by a lower lobe forward 
cargo door with damaged lock sectors that partially opened in 
flight a summary of the directive said 
this condition if not corrected could result in the opening 
of a lower lobe cargo door in flight which could result in rapid 
depressurization of the airplane it said 
faa spokesman mitch barker in seattle said he didnt have the 
technical expertise to say whether a cargo door opening in flight 
could cause a hole to be ripped in the planes fuselage 
the cargo door incident that brought the order was on a pan 
american flight in march 1987 said paul turk of avmark an aviation 
appraisal firm that keeps track of airliners throughout the world 
turk said after examining photographs and videotape of the 
airliner he would expect to see scorch marks on the fuselage and 
luggage if a bomb had gone off and there were none visible in the 
photographs but he said it would take careful inspection to 
determine the cause 
chris witkowski of the aviation consumer action project which 
represents airline passengers said if it is a cargo door problem 
it is a bad omen for safety in the industry because it raises a 
maintenance problem the airline industry dealt with after a fatal 
crash near paris in 1974 
that crash killed more than 350 people aboard a turkish air dc10 
and was the worlds worst air disaster up to the time it occurred 
the cargo door popped off in flight depressurizing the aircraft 
buckling the airliner floor and breaking wires and cables needed to 
control the plane 
boeing spokesman harrison said the structure of boeing aircraft 
is triple redundant safe and because of its design that the 
united plane was able to return to honolulu despite the gaping hole 
in its side

president bush said today that he and federal 
reserve board chairman alan greenspan may disagree about the 
interpretation of economic indicators but both men agree on the 
need to reduce the federal budget deficit 
weve got a little difference of interpretation at this point 
as to how you read the indicators on inflation and thats the only 
difference weve got bush said in response to questions at an 
early morning news conference before leaving tokyo 
we share the common objectives of needing to get the deficit 
down bush said and i still maintain we are not far apart 
questions about differing views of the economy between bush and 
greenspan arose anew friday after the fed dramatically escalated its 
fight against inflation by raising its key bank lending rate to the 
highest level in three years the fed acted to dampen upward 
pressure on prices 
the move was seen as a repudiation of recent bush administration 
claims that price increases havent been serious enough to warrant 
higher interest rates private analysts said the move was long 
overdue and should have been stronger 
the central bank raised the discount rate the fee it charges for 
shortterm loans to member banks from 65 percent to 7 percent the 
action was approved on a 61 vote with board member martha seger 
dissenting

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
taking a page from us diplomacy sought this week to establish the 
soviet union as an impartial broker between arabs and israelis 
in doing so shevardnadze abandoned the tough antiisraeli 
rhetoric that was the hallmark of past kremlin diplomacy in the 
region and won the endorsement of jordan and egypt arab moderates 
traditionally close to washington 
the soviet initiative poses a challenge to the administration of 
president bush who denied he was being outflanked by moscows new 
goodguy approach 
bush countered the soviet moves by meeting in tokyo with 
president hosni mubarak of egypt president chaim herzog of israel 
and king hussein of jordan 
secretary of state james a baker iii suggested the soviets were 
engaged in rhetorical exercises he said there were some 
opportunities to be explored but that the united states was not 
yet prepared to undertake new initiatives 
what lent credibility to shevardnadzes efforts was his ability 
to establish an indirect dialogue between israel and the palestine 
liberation organization the most intractable middle east 
adversaries 
he managed to seat plo chief yasser arafat and israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens on the same couch on the same day for lengthy 
but separate talks at the nileside soviet embassy both agreed the 
soviets could be useful intermediaries 
afterward arens announced that a series of talks had been 
arranged to pursue peace prospects he said the soviets had a role 
to play in influencing radical arab states such as syria which has 
opposed a negotiated settlement 
arafat declared that indirect negotiations already had begun with 
shevardnadze briefing arafat on his talks with arens and planning to 
report back to the israelis on the plos positions 
shevardnadze has embarked on a risky policy on which he has 
staked soviet prestige its failure could signal that the new 
whitehat image masks weakness and could mean there is skepticism 
about the soviets ability to deliver the goods 
the choice of cairo as the focus for the diplomatic initiative 
appeared calculated to show the soviets had regained their position 
in the middle east and could once again play on a field that for the 
past decade has been exclusively american 
it was here that the united states achieved its greatest middle 
east success the 1979 israelegypt peace treaty and the soviets 
suffered their greatest setback expulsion of 21000 soviet 
advisers in july 1972 and the loss of the largest arab state as an 
ally 
shevardnadze echoing former president reagans trust but 
verify proposal for arms reduction offered guarantees to underpin 
an eventual peace settlement including a new idea for onsite 
inspections to prevent military buildups 
we see no reason why the parties to a future arabisraeli 
settlement could not engage in mutual inspections and onsite 
monitoring including short notice suspectsite inspections he 
said 
shevardnadze saying he was engaged in an act of creative 
work signaled that spontaneity and imagination would be central 
to the soviet approach a major change from the ponderous and 
inflexible diplomacy of the pregorbachev era 
underscoring the point shevardnadze much like a us 
politician let himself be buttonholed on doorsteps by reporters 
and seemed to enjoy the repartee of such informal encounters 
in all his public statements shevardnadzes rhetoric was 
striking for its absence of verbal poison there were even touches 
of humility 
in a speech to egyptian politicians for example he argued that 
the middle east was headed for war if peace talks could not be 
arranged and added 
all this is not being said in order to give moral lessons we 
are one might say speaking from experience knowing what are the 
results of confrontation dogmatic thinking and unduly ideologizing 
international relations 
his warnings to israel were veiled but the message was clear and 
unchanged from the days before the soviet policy of glasnost it was 
imperative that israel accept dialogue with the plo and agree to 
the soviet proposal for an international conference 
he said israel would be isolated if it refused and hinted that 
obstinancy could result in economic sanctions 
unless such an approach is taken complications may arise in 
relations between the middle east and most of the rest of the 
world he said 
despite the promise of another arensshevardnadze meeting one 
major question that threatened the soviet pursuit of the middle east 
matchmaker role was whether israel would continue to answer soviet 
summonses 
israel had hoped the soviets would restore full diplomatic 
relations severed after the 1967 middle east war but shevardnadze 
linked this to israels acceptance of the plo and participation in 
an international peace conference 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel then restated his 
nations precairo position that the soviets cannot play a role in 
negotiations without normal relations with israel

president bush said saturday that recent 
developments in the middle east present an opportunity for resolving 
the 40year arabisraeli conflict but he cautioned against hasty 
us mediation moves 
bush said his discussions here with three mideastern leaders 
jordans king hussein and presidents hosni mubarak of egypt and 
chaim herzog of israel focused on how best to take advantage of 
the changes in the region 
we discussed what new opportunities may exist to take 
advantage of the positive elements in the current situation bush 
said at a news conference before leaving for china 
i made clear the continuing readiness of the united states to 
facilitate this effort in a manner thats consistent with the 
security of israel and the security of our arab friends in the 
region as well bush said 
the positive developments bush listed include the acceptance by 
yasser arafat head of the palestine liberation organization of 
israels right to exist and his renunciation of terrorism arafats 
concessions led the united states to launch a dialogue last december 
with the previously banned organization 
the 14month palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories has led to a recognition on the part of israel 
that something needs to be done bush added 
and i think theres a readiness on the part of other arab 
states to get serious about negotiation and discussions he said 
egypts return to the fold of the arab world could also serve as 
an important catalyst for peace moves bush said 
all these are ingredients that i think offer opportunity he 
said 
but he cautioned that before we just go rushing out to do 
something for the sake of doing something we take a step that is 
prudent 
after all he said ive been in this job for one month and 
this problem has been there for year after year after year

former sen norris cotton who earned a 
reputation as a laconic fiercely independent and conscientious 
yankee statesman in three decades in congress has died of pneumonia 
at age 88 
cotton who called himself a rockribbed conservative and proud 
of it died friday at his home said jane bassick a spokeswoman 
for dartmouthhitchcock medical center in hanover 
he embodied the substance and character of the state and people 
he served for so many years said sen warren rudman rnh the 
death of norris cotton marks the passage of a great new hampshire 
statesman and the end of an era 
gov judd gregg ordered state flags lowered to halfstaff in 
memory of cotton who he said represented the best of yankee 
statesmanship 
former president nixon called cotton one of my closest friends 
in washington in a statement issued from his home in saddle brook 
nj 
cotton and nixon became friends when both were sworn in as 
freshman representatives in 1946 
cotton went to the senate in 1954 after winning an election to 
fill the two remaining years of the late sen charles tobeys term 
on aug 4 1974 the day nixon resigned the presidency cotton 
was among those the president phoned to say goodbye 
it was the saddest day of my life cotton recalled but he 
said he was relieved nixon had quit and saved him the agony of 
judging his friend in a senate impeachment cottons first vote as a 
senator had been a vote to censure sen joseph mccarthy 
cotton retired from the senate in 1974 but returned for about 
six weeks the following year while voters settled a disputed 
election 
the warren native came from a poor family and paid for his 
education at phillips exeter academy connecticuts wesleyan 
university and george washington university law school by waiting on 
tables washing dishes and working as a bellhop in the summer 
cotton began his political career at age 22 when he was elected 
to the state house of representatives he later served as a 
prosecutor judge and speaker of the new hampshire house 
cottons political headquarters was the lebanon fire house which 
he called his club there hed play cribbage and chat with a 
steady stream of farmers businessmen workers and bankers 
cottons first wife ruth died at age 85 in 1978 after 51 years 
of marriage they had no children 
in 1980 cotton married eleanor coolidge brown his longtime

a man whose conviction for the slaying of a 
policeman was questioned in the movie the thin blue line has 
been refused a parole request despite a state judges strong backing 
citing the nature of the crime and use of a weapon in it the 
state board of pardons and paroles voted 21 on friday to deny 
parole for randall dale adams 
fridays decision means adams who was convicted for the 1976 
slaying of dallas policeman robert wood will remain imprisoned even 
though his initial accuser david ray harris has recanted and 
virtually confessed to the crime 
adams attorney randy schaffer of houston criticized the parole 
boards decision saying he was tired of having to apologize to 
him adams and his mother for the lack of justice in texas 
he said the board routinely paroles convicted killers who have 
served fractions of their sentences but is absolutely unable to 
respond to the case of an innocent man 
if you put all of that together what they mean is because 
david harris killed robert wood with a gun then randall adams is 
denied parole schaffer said i think their action today 
demonstrates why theyre the most disrespected parole board in the 
country 
the parole board scheduled adams next review for december 1990 
prison officials said adams could not accept outside calls nor 
could he return phone messages 
the board decided to conduct a special review of the case after 
state district judge larry baraka of dallas recommended to the texas 
court of criminal appeals that adams receive a new trial or be set 
free 
in december baraka recommended a new trial for the 40yearold 
adams saying his first trial was unfair because of inadequate 
defense attorneys baraka who conducted a threeday hearing on the 
matter also questioned the credibility of witnesses who testified 
against adams 
the court of criminal appeals may take as long as two years to 
act on barakas recommendation 
baraka also had written to the parole board urging members to 
grant adams parole 
the adams case was the subject of the errol morris documentary 
the thin blue line which strongly suggested that adams was 
innocent of the slaying 
the documentary accused authorities of railroading adams and 
questioned the credibility of the witnesses against him morris was 
at work on a film in detroit friday and could not be reached for 
comment 
harris who was 16 at the time of the wood murder said in the 
1977 trial he was a passenger in the car when adams killed wood who 
had pulled them over 
but harris said at the hearing conducted by baraka that adams did 
not commit the slaying harris now on death row for the 1985 
murder of a beaumont texas man provided so many details about 
the crime that baraka declared his testimony a virtual confession

president bush said that 45 years ago he would not 
have believed it possible that he would attend the funeral of 
emperor hirohito but said he came to japan to show he harbors no 
bitterness about world war ii 
i cant say that in the quiet of the ceremony that my mind 
didnt go back to the wonder of it all bush told a news 
conference i vividly remember the personal friends that were in 
our squadron that are no longer alive but my mind didnt dwell 
on that at all 
bush the youngest pilot in the navy when he was commissioned 
was shot down by japanese gunners on sept 2 1944 during a bombing 
attack on chichi jima his two crew members were killed and he was 
rescued by a passing american submarine 
what i really thought was isnt it miraculous what has 
happened since the war bush said 
gen douglas macarthurs decision not to prosecute hirohito for 
war crimes proved to be correct in terms of japans move towards 
democracy bush said 
there had been criticism of bush for attending the funeral of 
hirohito the last of the world war ii leaders to die 
i was certain from the day that i committed to come here that 
this was correct for the united states and perhaps having been in 
combat in world war ii maybe the decision was more correct maybe 
it was more profound to be here he said 
were talking about a friend were talking about an ally he 
said 
bush conceded that if someone had told him 45 years ago when 
there was such hard feeling about the japanese leader that he 
would be attending hirohitos funeral i would have said no way 
but here we are 
theres a very good lesson for civilized countries in all 
this bush said

phone companies must use different prefixes 
for calling services with sexually explicit material supply them 
only by subscription and allow businesses to block those calls a 
state agency ruled 
fridays action by the california public utilities commission was 
hailed as a major ruling by attorney robert gnaizda of public 
advocates who represented 12 groups that sought changes to protect 
consumers and prevent children from running up bills of thousands 
of dollars with the calls 
the tentative decision scheduled to come up for a final vote on 
march 22 expands a 1987 ruling that allowed residential customers 
to block the calls which typically carry 976 prefixes 
businesses and schools have sought the option because many of 
their phones are easily accessible and often go unmonitored 
recorded and live messages intended only for adults would be 
limited to a separate telephone prefix 
in addition to restricting the services to subscription only the 
commission limited costs to no more than 5 for the first minute and 
1 for each additional minute with a 20 maximum cost per call 
gnaizda said the change in perminute charges was the most 
innovative aspect of the commissions ruling 
the largest monthly bill for 976 service known to gnaizda was 
6000 
many of them bills were in the 5000 to 6000 range so 
thats not surprising at all he said 
but gnaizda was skeptical about the plan to have phone companies 
use three different prefixes to differentiate between services with 
sexually explicit material that would be harmful to children and 
provide such messages only by subscription 
theyll never be able to define it he said 
the commission also said pacific bell must contact customers as 
soon as the calls reach 150 or more in a billing period or 
temporarily block those services until the customer has been 
notified and given the chance to stop it 
it also said the seller of the phone service must provide an 
introductory message warning callers of the calls price and giving 
them a chance to hang up without charge 
while this revised settlement does not constitute a perfect 
900 service in our judgment it will produce a service with 
substantial benefit for california the commission said in a 
statement 
our goal is to disconnect dialaporn said pacific bell 
spokesman jim herold but until we have legal authority to do 
that weve designed our new 900 service to solve the problems some 
consumers have had with 976

a wellknown mexican poet was among the first 
of more than 400 inmates freed under an amnesty program for 
political prisoners the government said 
despite the pardon and release friday of poet and human rights 
advocate israel gutierrez hernandez activists complained that 
hundreds of others remain behind prison bars 
i am very excited i feel like this is a dream but i dont 
have much else to say the government news agency notimex quoted 
gutierrez hernandez as saying when he was released from state prison 
in the central city of san luis potosi 
he served five years of a 10year sentence for robbery criminal 
association and possession of weapons the 37yearold poet who has 
denied the charges was known as an adviser to peasant groups 
fighting for land rights 
the program unveiled this week by president carlos salinas de 
gortari appears aimed at appeasing human rights activists who say 
hundreds have been jailed or killed for their political beliefs 
interior minister fernando gutierrez barrios said the 403 
prisoners to be freed were jailed for violations committed for 
social and political reasons a statement from the presidents 
office said salinas would work with state governors to free 402 
other prisoners jailed for various offenses nationwide it gave no 
timetable 
salinas also pledged to send to congress a list of proposed penal 
code reforms that would make it easier to pardon some prisoners who 
committed crimes for political reasons the statement said 
luis ortiz monasterio the departments human rights director 
said friday about 1200 people jailed for crimes stemming from 
social struggles were expected to be released notimex said 
he was quoted as saying the list of 403 prisoners includes 
inmates from only 10 of mexicos 31 states because other state 
governments denied having anyone jailed for social or politically 
motivated crimes 
rosario ibarra the countrys most prominent human rights 
crusader said the government made the proposal because opposition 
groups have pressed for release of political prisoners 
but she said the program falls short 
what were sure of is that we will have to intensify the 
struggle for the the 1000 prisoners whose release we are demanding 
and for the 548 disappeared who must be accounted for the 
newspaper el universal quoted her as saying 
the disappeared refers to political prisoners whose 
whereabouts are unknown and who are presumed dead 
mrs ibarra this month held a hunger strike outside the interior 
department to press for release of the prisoners and an explanation 
of the whereabouts of missing prisoners 
the government previously has released prisoners including those 
jailed during the 1968 student movement in what amounted to a tacit 
acknowledgement that it had political prisoners 
an editorial in the leftist newspaper la jornada said the pardon 
should be viewed as a political gesture as a response to 
petitions and demands 
the question of human rights continues to be a delicate matter 
with points on the agenda that still arent resolved it said 
the political disappearances tortures persecutions illegal 
detentions add up to a group of anticonstitutional and injurious 
actions for the national harmony 
amnesty international said in its 1988 report that arbitrary 
detentions and killings of peasant and indian group members 
continue particularly in land disputes torture and other 
mistreatment of prisoners also continue and at least 23 political 
prisoners remained in jail the report said

the communist party chief in soviet moldavia has 
endorsed demands by moldavian nationalists to make their language 
official and use the alphabet of neighboring romania 
thousands of demonstrators rallied in recent weeks in the 
republics capital kishinev to demand official status for the 
moldavian language and introduction of a latin alphabet used for 
the otherwise identical romanian language 
despite attempts by the russian czars and soviet authorities to 
align moldavians with russia romania has long maintained that 
moldavians are really romanians in language and culture 
party leader semyon grossu went on the western republics 
television friday and condemned the activists for going too far but 
he indicated support on the language issue according to the 
official news agency tass 
working out the conception of the moldavian state language is 
envisaged as well as studying problems in connection with the 
transfer of written moldavian to the latin alphabet tass 
paraphrased grossu as saying 
he said preparation is under way on a series of draft laws on the 
status of the moldavian language tass reported 
moldavians have long objected to the soviet insistence that they 
use the cyrillic alphabet the one used for russian for their 
regional language they say they prefer the latin alphabet used for 
romanian 
the republic of 42 million people has had a history of foreign 
domination known as bessarabia under the turks it was annexed by 
the russian czars from the ottoman empire in 1912 romania seized 
the area in 1918 and ruled it until the soviet union took it over in 
1940 
the following year romanian troops reoccupied the region the 
red army reclaimed it in 1944 
in the television broadcast grossu condemned the recent 
nationalist demonstrations saying they were unsanctioned and that 
their organizers stir up fright and emotions tass said he 
called the protests an example of extremism demagoguery and 
irresponsibility 
under mikhail gorbachev nationalism has blossomed in many parts 
of the soviet union especially the baltic republics of estonia 
latvia and lithuania 
gorbachev has allowed greater autonomy for the republics in 
cultural economic and linguistic affairs activists have used his 
policy of glasnost or openness to vent long pentup national 
grievances

new york city is hoping a program to transfer 
some mental patients to shelters for the homeless will help relieve 
the severe overcrowding in psychiatric wards the new york times 
reported today 
we are going to try it on a small scale said first deputy 
mayor stanley brezenoff if it doesnt work we wont continue 
it 
the new policy was adopted over the objections of two city 
commissioners the times said 
in a memo written by city human resources administrator william 
grinker and sara l kellermann the commissioner of the citys 
department of mental health the two argued that the plan was 
illadvised 
a policy reversal to discharge patients to municipal 
shelters at this juncture would discredit the expanded city effort 
to treat its most vulnerable population they wrote 
but brezenoff said the plan is an attempt at pragmatic 
humaneness 
shelters receiving the patients would be staffed with 
psychiatrists nurses and social workers to try to help the patients 
find a place to live 
dr luis marcos vice president for mental hygiene at the citys 
health and hospitals corp said work has started to provide 46 beds 
at two shelters in manhattan and brooklyn with mental health 
services 
ideally a shelter is not the optimal residence it is a last 
resort marcos said but it is better to discharge appropriate 
patients to the shelters than have them inappropriately occupy a 
hospital bed that can be used by patients waiting in the emergency 
room 
critics of the new plan however said all it does is shift 
patients from one city agency to another without solving any 
problems 
many experts say the citys homeless problems stem from a state 
decision decades ago to empty beds in state psychiatric hospitals 
without any alternatives for those needing assistance 
the new city plan some experts said would repeat the mistakes 
of the state

shots were fired in the air today as 
supporters of former president ferdinand marcos scuffled with police 
on the third anniversary of the people power uprising that 
propelled corazon aquino to the presidency 
mrs aquino who returned today from the funeral of emperor 
hirohito said international leaders among them president bush 
they told me that they admire us filipinos for that nonviolent 
revolution 
she made her comments during festivities along epifanio delos 
santos avenue where hundreds of thousands of civilians massed three 
years ago to protect soldiers who had mutinied against marcos 
but some prominent filipinos who helped install her in power 
boycotted the festivities to show disappointment with mrs aquinos 
leadership police estimated todays crowd at 30000 smaller than 
the last two anniversaries 
in his anniversary address manilas roman catholic archbishop 
cardinal jaime l sin praised the spirit of the uprising but warned 
that corruption and political bickering had returned to the dismay 
of us all 
witnesses said the trouble started when about 3000 loyalists 
rallied near a television station demanding marcos be allowed to 
return from exile in hawaii marcos in declining health has lived 
in honolulu since the uprising ended his 20year rule on feb 25 
1986 
witnesses said three men bolted from the car and grabbed at least 
one marcos supporter and forced him into their vehicle when 
protesters rushed the car the intruders fired in the air and sped 
away the witnesses said 
later police pfc albert gatos said he and two fellow officers 
were transporting a robbery suspect to headquarters when the 
loyalists attacked their car gatos said the abducted loyalist 
had been arrested 
todays anniversary celebrations began with the ringing of church 
bells across this island nation and included masses fireworks and 
street dancing along epifanio avenue smaller celebrations were 
planned in most provincial cities 
while mrs aquino was in tokyo for fridays funeral the 
160000member armed forces were on full alert because of coup 
rumors sweeping the capital 
brig gen alexander aguirre said about 2000 troops would 
provide security during the festivities which will also include a 
roman catholic mass street dancing fireworks and dedication of a 
giant statue of the virgin mary 
meanwhile the military said a soldier and two civilians were 
arrested outside the capital in a van packed with 1650 pounds of 
explosives a senior officer said the three are believed linked to 
rightwing extremists 
lt col manuel oxales deputy chief of the national capital 
region defense command said the soldier a second man and a woman 
were arrested late friday in taytay a few miles from the 
celebration site 
the implication is quite big oxales said asked if the 
explosives were meant for a new coup attempt he said were 
trying to find out 
the military also said an officer in a province about 200 miles 
southeast of manila was placed under restrictions for purported 
links to renegade lt col gregorio honasan leader of a 1987 
attempt to topple mrs aquino 
sen juan ponce enrile the former defense minister said he 
would boycott todays festivities 
i will not join the celebrations because i think there is no 
cause for celebration enrile said they really wanted change 
for the country but nothing is clear and our future is still 
dim 
enrile in his former post led a mutiny against marcos on feb 22 
1986 that triggered the people power uprising 
but enrile later turned against mrs aquino she fired him as 
defense minister on nov 23 1986 after a failed coup by his 
followers 
defense secretary fidel ramos another key figure in the 1986 
revolt said today the government needs more time to achieve all its 
goals 
we should not be discouraged ramos told reporters we 
should not listen that our government is on the brink of collapse 
and that the filipinos cannot do it 
liberals and leftist activists say mrs aquino tolerates military 
abuses of civil rights in the governments 20year war against 
communist guerrillas and has not pressed land reform and other 
social programs 
on friday about 10000 leftists took to the streets in manila to 
express their dissatisfaction with mrs aquino shouting 
antigovernment slogans and burning a 10foot papier mache effigy of 
the president

many of the 590000 people who sought 
compensation after the bhopal gas disaster filed false injury 
claims and about half the claimants may never get any money relief 
officials said today 
the government is eager to settle claims after union carbide 
corp on friday finished putting up 470 million ordered by the 
indian supreme court to fully settle injury claims the court 
ordered the payment on feb 14 to settle claims arising from the 
leak the worlds worst industrial disaster 
we have sent repeated reminders to the claimants to get 
themselves medically examined or produce documents proving that they 
were affected by the toxic gas said a senior official of the 
governments gas relief and rehabilitation department 
but under half of the total claimants have so far come forward 
to get themselves certified as gas victims the official said on 
condition of anonymity 
the government was asked friday to submit a breakdown of how the 
funds would be allotted within a week 
more than 3400 people were killed by the leak of methyl 
isocyanate gas from a union carbide pesticide plant on dec 3 1984 
in this central indian city 
victims are still dying at the rate of more than one daily 
medical records indicate 
the government says 20000 people are seriously injured by 
exposure to the gas about 590000 people have filed damage claims 
alleging certain injuries 
the government set up the gas relief and rehabilitation 
department to handle documentation of claims about 100 doctors have 
been helping bureaucrats identify victims 
about 250000 claims have been certified so far officials said 
they said they would like to provide money to genuine victims as 
soon as possible since repeated reminders have failed to produce

some surprise developments enlivened the race for 
mayor in its last full week as a prominent republican mounted a 
writein campaign and democrat richard m daley stirred up a racial 
issue 
both events could spell trouble for daley in his effort to claim 
the office that was once all but owned by his father the late mayor 
richard j daley 
republican edward vrdolyak a former power in the democratic 
party on wednesday gave his blessing to a writein effort in his 
behalf in next tuesdays primary 
ordinarily a republican writein campaign in this democratic 
city would be of little consequence but some observers believe 
vrdolyak could cut into the lead polls have given daley in the 
democratic primary 
the reasoning is that vrdolyak has a following among some white 
ethnic voters who would have been expected to cast their votes for 
daley rather than mayor eugene sawyer who is black 
meanwhile daley the cook county states attorney was 
criticized friday for remarks he made at a rally before a 
predominantly white audience on the southwest side 
john mcdermott chairman of the committee on decent unbiased 
campaign tactics charged that daley told the crowd you want a 
white mayor to sit down with everybody 
daley angrily denied he made a racial comment and some people who 
listened to tape recordings said it appeared he merely stumbled over 
a word that made it sound like he said white mayor 
recent polls have continued to give daley a lead but a narrowing 
one 
whoever wins the democratic primary will run in the april 4 
general election against the winner of the gop primary as well as 
the thirdparty candidacy of alderman timothy evans who like sawyer 
is black 
vrdolyak is running against gopendorsed herbert sohn 
in a radio show taping vrdolyak said he hopes to win 10000 
votes enough to guarantee him the nomination in this democratic 
stronghold that is half what he got from his own ward in a failed 
1987 mayoral bid 
his big challenge tuesday will be to get people to properly write 
in votes with punchcard voting machines said paul green a 
professor at governors state university in suburban university park 
its physically very difficult to have legal writeins on a 
punchcard system said green who follows city politics

a veteran sheriffs deputy is being held for 
investigation into the murders of three prostitutes after he was 
arrested while allegedly sharing cocaine with another prostitute 
deputy rickey ross 40 was picked up early thursday by police 
officers and a loaded gun found in the trunk of the countyleased 
unmarked car ross was driving was linked through ballistics tests to 
three 1988 murders police chief daryl gates and los angeles county 
sheriff sherman block told a press conference friday 
the southcentral area of the city where ross was arrested has 
been the scene of numerous prostitute slayings since the late 1970s 
including some once attributed to a southside slayer but later 
to several suspects 
gates would not comment on any possible connection between 
unsolved killings and the three murders linked to ross who has been 
with the los angeles county sheriffs department for 18 years 
there are some differences with other homicides in the 
southcentral portion of los angeles so this could be three and 
only three and were not speculating that there will be any more 
than this gates said 
ross is one of a number of suspects under investigation in a 
series of prostitute slayings deputy district attorney sterling e 
norris said 
the district attorneys office is reviewing the evidence on ross 
and a decision on charges will be made monday said spokesman andy 
reynolds 
block said ross who is married and has two children ages 20 and 
5 had been assigned to a narcotics unit at los angeles 
international airport 
he has a very fine record block said he has been a very 
effective investigator in the narcotics bureau 
the officers originally arrested ross for investigation of 
driving under the influence of an intoxicating substance the name 
of the woman in the car with ross was withheld but gates said she 
told investigators they had been smoking cocaine gates said 
officers determined she was a prostitute 
as ballistics testing of the gun found in the trunk was 
performed ross and investigators went to his home in rialto about 
55 miles east of downtown los angeles about 5 pm thursday tests 
linked the gun to the three killings and he was arrested for 
investigation of murder 
a search warrant was obtained and the home was searched but gates 
would not reveal any information about what was recovered there

soviet authorities today began shutting down 
armenias nuclear power plant as a precaution in case another 
earthquake strikes the region according to the official news agency 
it was the first time the soviets have ever halted operations at 
a plant that appears to have no problems 
the armenian plant was criticized when it was first built and 
concerns took on new urgency after an earthquake on dec 7 
devastated northwestern armenia and killed 25000 people soviet 
authorities say the quake did not damage the plant 20 miles from 
the republics capital yerevan 
the news agency tass said technicians today finished closing one 
of the plants two watercooled uraniumpowered reactors the 
second reactor is to be shut down march 18 
the move was another example of the kremlins new more cautious 
approach to nuclear power adopted after the april 26 1986 
explosion and fire at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the 
ukraine the worlds worst nuclear power accident killed 31 people 
and sent a cloud of radiation around the world 
an armenian georgy terstepanyan told the youth newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda that he was among a group of scientists that 
protested when plans were announced for the armenian plant in the 
late 1960s 
terstepanyan said he and others pointed out that the station was 
planned for construction on the ararat geological fault and would be 
vulnerable to earthquakes any radiation leak would contaminate the 
republics main water supply todays editions of the newspaper 
quoted him as saying 
the armenian plant designed to operate 30 years began supplying 
electricity for the republic and others in the soviet caucasus 
region in 1976 tass said 
in may 1986 a month after the chernobyl disaster and a year 
after mikhail s gorbachev took power authorities began 
reconsidering the merits of the plant 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov told reporters on dec 12 that the 
plant would be shut down in two years because of the earthquake 
danger 
but a group of experts sent to the plant after the dec 7 
earthquake concluded that unless the plant were strengthened its 
reactors should be shut down immediately 
the government heeded the advice out of concern for the safety 
of armenian pouplation tass said more than 1 million people live 
in yerevan 
the 407500kilowatt plant generates more than onethird of 
armenias electricity and authorities have called for residents to 
conserve power to avoid shortages it is to be turned into a thermal 
plant probably using natural gas as a fuel in a project expected 
to take up to four years to complete tass said 
in december soviet officials said six nuclear power projects had 
been scrapped because of earthquake danger or tougher standards 
imposed because of chernobyl

prince philip of britain who has been 
criticized at home for attending emperor hirohitos funeral today 
honored british soldiers who died in world war ii by laying wreaths 
at a cemetery 
accompanied by foreign secretary geoffrey howe philip honored 
the 1738 british australian and other war dead buried at the 
yokohama commonwealth war cemetery a day after attending the 
elaborate funeral of emperor hirohito 
in drizzling rain the two british representatives laid wreaths 
at a crucifix in the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and 
later spoke with members of the local british community 
in london today queen elizabeth ii appealed to a world war ii 
veteran to end his hunger strike protest over prince philips 
attendance at the funeral there was no immediate reaction to the 
latest appeal from andrew burgess 70 who has been eating nothing 
and drinking only black tea for the last nine days 
philips attendance at hirohitos funeral has been criticized by 
british war veterans and lawmakers who considered the late monarch a 
war criminal and who saw no reason to honor a man they blamed for 
the deaths of thousands of their comrades the royal family was 
criticized for sending the husband of queen elizabeth ii and the 
decision was debated in editorial columns 
to many millions outside japan hirohito will be remembered 
less for the dignified last years of his reign than for its first 
phase when aggressive war was waged in his name and barbarous 
atrocities were committed the times of london wrote in a january 
editorial after hirohitos death to those people the emperors 
passing will bring back painful memories 
fighting under hirohitos name japanese forces killed 27000 
british soldiers and another 20000 dutch 
many survivors also held hirohito accountable for atrocities 
committed against 127000 dutch people interned during the war 
we are accustomed to hear such kind of criticism said 
seizaburo sato a professor of political science at tokyo 
university japan made a mistake 
but didnt the british or dutch do really bad things to 
asians they colonized for example india or indonesia if they 
think about what they have done for a much longer period of time 
than japan did i think they should be more modest he said in an 
interview 
most historians maintain that the late emperor was merely a 
glorified figurehead of his generals with little if any political 
power hirohito died on jan 7 at age 87 never having made clear 
his role in the war 
the cemetery is on the site of a playground that was opened by 
hirohito himself more than 65 years ago when he was crown prince 
nestled in the hills of hodogaya in yokohama south of tokyo the 
cemetery also holds the remains of soldiers from canada india new 
zealand and other commonwealth nations and the ashes of an 
undetermined number of us soldiers 
many died while being held as prisoners of war in japan or aboard 
pow ships on the way to japan in 1942 following the surrender of 
singapore he loved his life but gave it in freeing the japanese 
people read one epitaph

former vice president walter mondale hasnt 
decided whether to run against sen rudy boschwitz in 1990 but 
minnesotans give him a good chance of defeating the incumbent a 
survey released today shows 
the poll conducted by the minneapolis star tribune on feb 
1520 found 49 percent of the 701 minnesota adults surveyed 
believed mondale would defeat boschwitz in a headtohead race 
forty percent said they thought boschwitz would win 
spokesmen for both men described the results as interesting 
its too early for these numbers to be very meaningful said 
mondales son ted who has been urging his father to run 
boschwitzs campaign director tom mason said the poll 
confirms what everybody thinks it would be a close competitive 
race 
mondale who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984 has said 
repeatedly that he does not intend to run for office again he now 
works as a lawyer in minneapolis 
mondale has led boschwitz in every published poll in the last 18 
months 
an august 1987 poll of 757 minnesota adults showed mondale 
leading boschwitz by 15 percentage points 
the latest poll for which no margin of error was cited showed a 
slight erosion in boschwitzs jobapproval rating those who 
approve strongly of his performance fell to 22 percent the 
lowest since mid1985 but his overall approval rating which 
includes strong and weak approval held fairly steady at 62 percent 
he has never been below 60 percent during his second term 
the percentage who said they had no opinion about boschwitzs 
performance or who refused to answer the question rose to its 
highest level at 20 percent 
for mondale the fact that less than half the respondents 
considered him the frontrunner cannot be entirely encouraging 
next to hubert h humphrey mondale has been the biggest name in 
minnesota politics over the last three decades 
he was the states attorney general a us senator a vice 
president and was the 1984 democratic presidential candidate since 
moving back to the state in 1987 hes been in the news as much or 
more than boschwitz

the soviet union which says it has stopped 
committing sane political dissidents to psychiatric hospitals will 
get a chance to prove that claim when a group of amerian 
psychiatrists visits sunday 
about 20 psychiatrists accompanied by a state department 
official arrive sunday for a three week visit and will meet with 
soviets they suspect are being held in psychiatric institutions for 
political reasons 
a soviet official said on friday that the americans will see that 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of perestroika or 
restructuring of soviet society has improved psychiatric treatment 
they will be given the opportunity to familiarize themselves 
with the system of psychiatric help in the ussr and the positive 
changes taking place in this area said yuri reshetov of the 
foreign ministry 
the americans will visit mental institutions examine patients 
and meet with soviet psychiatrists said reshetov head of the 
ministrys international humanitarian cooperation and human rights 
directorate 
he said the trip was organized by the us state and health and 
human services departments and the soviet foreign and health 
ministries 
neither reshetov nor american officials would provide an 
itinerary 
allowing us officials into oncesecret psychiatric institutions 
is another example of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater 
openness 
abuse of psychiatry in the soviet union has been a contentious 
issue between the superpowers for decades 
gorbachev as part of a wideranging effort to improve the soviet 
unions human rights record and restore credibility to his countrys 
health system has taken steps to end abuse of psychiatry 
in january 1988 the soviet press reported some pyschiatric 
hospitals were being transferred from the domain of the police to 
the health ministry and that a new law made it a crime to commit a 
sane person to a mental institution 
last month the head of the soviet psychiatrists society georgy 
morozov said there are no patients in mental hospitals in the 
ussr who are there for political reasons 
moscow activist alexander podrabinik and others have rejected 
that claim they say 20 to 30 healthy people remain in psychiatric 
hospitals and in many cases are forcibly injected with mindaltering 
drugs 
the state department last month credited the soviets with 
significant progress in the treatment of political prisoners it 
said the kremlin had freed all those held under laws limiting 
expressions of political and religious beliefs but that it still 
had questions about 30 prisoners whom soviet authorities consider to 
be criminals 
while many western psychiatrists acknowledge the kremlin has 
freed most people committed to asylums for political reasons they 
have demanded an admission of past abuses 
one soviet publication came close in november 
mikhail i buyanov a psychiatrist and neurologist wrote in the 
education newspaper uchitelskaya gazeta that soviet psychiatry was 
systematically used in the 1970s to suppress dissidents by declaring 
them mentally ill and committing them to asylums but he said 
officials still havent fully admitted mistakes

countrys best known black leader the crowd swelled to 1000 for 
seipeis burial 
we shouldnt point fingers at other people because stompie was 
interested in unity said a local antiapartheid leader mclean 
skhosane at the service dont let his death divide us 
the african national congress today issued a statement from 
lusaka zambia calling on blacks to avoid fratricidal attacks 
in the townships 
seipeis death is at the center of a controversy surrounding mrs 
mandela and her group of bodyguards known as the mandela united 
football club 
seipei and three young men staying at a methodist church 
sanctuary in the soweto township outside johannesburg allegedly were 
abducted to mrs mandelas home in late december and assaulted there 
by members of mandela united 
seipeis body was found in a soweto field jan 6 police said 
two members of mandela united have been charged with murder while 
the team bus driver also has been arrested but not charged mrs 
mandela has denied any personal involvement in seipeis death 
the reasons for seipeis alleged abduction and beating remain 
unclear 
mrs mandela has said the youths were taken from the methodist 
church because they were being sexually abused by a minister 
however methodist church officials said after conducting an 
investigation that there was no truth to mrs mandelas allegations 
no reason has been given for the alleged beating of seipei although 
there are numerous rivalries among black groups in the townships 
seipei is one of four people killed the last two months who had 
direct or indirect links to either mrs mandela or mandela united 
seipei became an antiapartheid activist at age 10 when he and a 
friend formed the under fourteens in tumahole 
more than 1000 youths served under seipeis command in the 
wellorganized childrens army challenging local police and 
progovernment vigilantes during the height of black township unrest 
in 198586 
the other groups were all talk and no action the 4foot 
activist told a british journalist in 1987 we formed an army to 
protect the people from harassment 
at age 11 he was detained for the first time becoming the 
youngest person held under stateofemergency regulations 
he learned chess and tried to keep up with studies that were 
interrupted when he left primary school in 1986 
colleagues said his political awareness was remarkable and he 
could recite sections of important political documents by heart

the removal of all foreign warships from the persian gulf and said 
moscow is ready to withdraw its fleet to help revive stalled 
iraniraq peace talks

concern about the continued presence of us and other western 
navies in the strategic waterway despite the 6monthold ceasefire 
in iraniraq war 
he later left for tehran on the last leg of a 10day fivenation 
middle east tour and said he will hold talks with ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini who rarely meets with foreign dignitaries on peace 
efforts in the gulf region 
but he did not say whether he would discuss khomeinis death 
sentence on british novelist salman rushdie whose prizewinning book 
the satanic verses is considered by iran and other moslem 
nations to be offensive to islam clerics in iran have placed a 52 
million bounty on the head of rushdie who was born a moslem in 
bombay india but who now lives in london 
sources in london said on friday that britain has asked 
shevardnadze to press iran to renounce its death threat a source in 
britains foreign office source said today that britain has not 
received a reply from the soviets 
irans reaction to rushdies novel was criticized by president 
bush and led common market countries to recall their senior 
diplomats in tehran in protest 
after two days of talks with iraqi leaders shevardnadze told a 
news conference in baghdad today our views were identical that 
there is a need for joint eforts by all countries in the gulf to 
clear the general atmosphere and maintain security in the area 
speaking in russian through an interpreter shevardnadze said an 
international agreement could be reached by all parties using the 
gulf with full guarantees from the five permanent members of the 
un security council the soviet union the united states britain 
china and france 
sheverdnadzes call appeared to be directed primarily at the 
united states which has reduced its fleet in the gulf region but 
still has 23 warships there the soviets have a much smaller naval 
force in the waterway italy belgium and the netherlands which 
sent naval flotillas into the gulf in july 1987 to support us 
moves to protect shipping have all withdrawn their ships 
france still has some mine sweepers in the gulf but britain 
plans to withdraw the last of its mine sweepers in the next week or 
two 
iran has repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of foreign navies 
shevardnadze said i will not rule out that the parties 
benefiting from the gulf will conclude an agreement on how to 
implement their international obligations within a common order 
agreed upon by all 
he said he agreed with iraqi president saddam hussein and other 
iraqi leaders on ways of solving the problem of the foreign naval 
presence in the waterway but he did not elaborate 
unmediated peace talks between iran and iraq have been stalled 
since the aug 20 ceasefire on a variety of issues including a

example of a moslem country that has been prepared to uphold the

unjustifiable intemperate incitements to murder that have emerged 
from iran howe said 
at least seven people were killed feb 1213 in protests in 
pakistan and in indias northern jammukashmir state the book has 
been banned in pakistan south africa bangladesh iran india and

meets on sunday with iranian vice president mostafa mir salim

facsimile machines those beeping little 
devices increasingly used to send everything from office memos to 
valentine greetings are sparking demands for laws against fax 
attacks 
washington state is one of at least eight states considering 
proposals to curb what critics say is a rising tide of junk fax 
printed advertisements that pop up unsolicited on office and home 
fax machines 
fax owners and dealers told a legislative panel here recently 
that the machines which owners tend to leave hooked up to phone 
lines 24 hours a day are completely vulnerable to fax attacks 
of unwanted advertisements 
transmissions which take an average of a minute per page can 
tie up a machine and prevent the sending or receiving of desired 
documents said lee bowman a facsimile machine salesman who 
supports regulation the receiver also has to pay for the paper the 
incoming advertisement is printed on whether its wanted or not 
this is the ultimate in abusive use of a private communication 
system complained rep ken jacobsen a democrat from seattle who 
is sponsoring a measure to restrict junk fax transmissions you 
get a message you didnt want from people you dont know on paper 
they didnt buy 
his researcher deborah senn said other states considering 
similar legislation are connecticut oregon california michigan 
minnesota new york and maryland about 2 million of the devices 
have been sold in the united states in the last few years she said 
and their popularity is growing 
the junk fax problem seems to be on the verge of exploding 
jacobsen said 
but bill mccue president of public fax an orange calif 
publisher of a fax directory and trade magazine contends the 
problem is largely a creation of news organizations because public 
relations people like to send releases by fax he said the media 
appear to be the one group that does suffer an inundation of junk 
fax 
for everyone else he said the media are making a monumental 
problem out of nothing its a cheap shot it really is 
donna murdoch executive director of the american facsimile 
association in philadelphia agreed that the problem is overstated 
we ask people how many pieces of junk fax are you really 
getting she said and people say the most they can remember 
getting is two pieces in a week 
but jacobsen asserted that if junk fax is not a major problem 
now it soon will be he noted that one computer maker already is 
marketing a device that can dial randomly and automatically send 
advertisements when a connection to a fax machine is made 
my feeling is lets nip junk fax in the bud before it becomes 
big business and were accused of trying to destroy an industry 
he said 
jacobsens measure whic is expected to clear the house soon and 
head for the senate would require senders of commercial 
solicitations to get advance permission from the intended receiver 
violators could face civil action that could net the unwilling 
recipient of the junk fax up to 500 
mccue called the proposal which is similar to legislation being 
considered in oregon and connecticut lunacy but bowman said he 
and colleagues think its reasonable 
bowman said the junk problem is only going to grow here just 
as it already has in japan where fax machines are so popular that 
coinoperated units can be found in restaurants and hotels 
they turn their machines off at night in japan now because of 
the junk fax bowman said 
he told the house committee that junk fax advertisers are 
offering prizes in exchange for the telephone numbers of fax 
machines the numbers are worth money to these people he said 
in the next five or 10 years junk fax could get real bad 
especially once fax machines start getting into households 
mccue said the advertising industry can better keep a lid on the 
problem through selfregulation he is pushing advertisers to follow 
his rules of fax etiquette such as transmitting only during 
offhours and condensing the message to save time and paper 
the golden rule of fax is fax unto others as you would have 
them fax unto you mccue said

more than a dozen men armed with sticks and 
pipes chased a 20yearold transient for two blocks through the 
heart of downtown before beating and stabbing him to death police 
said 
authorities declined to speculate on why the man whose name was 
withheld pending notification of relatives was slain however 
officers noted the killing took place in an area known for 
drugdealing where a similar slaying by an angry mob took place last 
month after a drug deal soured 
in that case it was definitely a drug deal gone bad said 
police detective john dunkin 
the latest victim had apparently argued with a group of about 15 
men shortly before he was killed and robbed of an undisclosed sum of 
money about 1 am friday 
he was stabbed eight or nine times robbed and left to die 
dunkin said 
officers arrested four men seen running from the scene the men 
identified as james turner 19 adrian norris 19 robert riley 18 
and gerald jackson 25 were held without bail for investigation of 
murder dunkin said

responding to concern over organized crime 
lawmakers in 1970 gave prosecutors a powerful weapon to use against 
mobsters and racketeers who prey on business labor and consumers 
nineteen years later however business executives are saying the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico is often 
used against them in a fashion never intended by congress they want 
it changed 
we are just interested in bringing some sense to this much 
abused statute says washington attorney jack quinn who is 
pushing for overhaul of rico on behalf of state farm insurance co 
capitol hill is watching carefully as a wellheeled business 
coalition prepares for a showdown with consumer groups over issue 
it may be that its being used in some places in civil actions 
when maybe it shouldnt be sen warren rudman rnh said last 
week 
sen dale bumpers dark told the same senate subcommittee 
session he knew of one brokerage firm facing a potential 
milliondollar bill for duplicating documents to defend a rico civil 
suit filed by a disgruntled investor 
everybody who loses money these days wants to sue the brokerage 
firm bumpers said i dont want to jeopardize this legitimate 
law enforcement tool but that case is obviously outrageous 
the dispute over the law itself however is not that simple 
consumer advocates are sending out storm warnings the bill 
contains special provisions for the scandalridden securities and 
commodity industries 
the savings and loan industry reeling from fraud and 
mismanagement could also benefit from key provisions of the bill 
which went into the hopper for the third time in as many years last 
week 
this legislation weakening rico comes at the worst possible 
time in the middle of an unprecedented corporate crime wave 
consumer advocate ralph nader says this is no time for members of 
congress to be soft on corporate crime 
sponsored in the house by rep frederick boucher dva the bill 
would leave much praised criminal provisions of the law untouched 
but it would make major changes in civil provisions that permit 
victims of racketeering and other frauds to receive triple damages 
if they win their lawsuits 
more than 2500 civil lawsuits were filed in federal courts 
nationwide under the rico statute between nov 1 1985 and last 
june 30 this explosion combined with concerns in the business 
community over just how far it might go has fueled the campaign 
soften the measures civil provisions 
civil rico is truly a statute run rampant says boucher it 
was intended for use against persons involved in organized crime 
but its actual use has been almost exclusively against the business 
community 
in the past plaintiffs have used the civil provisions of rico 
and its treble damage penalty in ordinary contract and commercial 
litigation circumstances far removed from the intent of congress 
to strike at organized crime says sen orrin hatch rutah one 
of the senate sponsors of legislation to change the law 
under the bill federal state and local governments would still 
be able to collect triple damages in any case 
consumers also would be able to collect triple damages 
consisting of actual damages plus twice that amount in punitive 
damages as well as court costs and attorneys fees but here there 
are exceptions 
investors hurt by insider stock trading could collect triple 
damages under the bill but the scandal that has battered wall 
streets arbitrage and junk bond empires includes many alleged 
offenses besides insider trading 
investors filing rico suits in these other cases would be able to 
collect no more than actual damages under the bill 
the same would hold for those who suffered losses as a result of 
fraud in the currently unfolding fbi investigation of the chicago 
commodity futures markets 
those other than governments and consumers filing civil suits 
would be able to collect no more than actual damages unless the 
defendant had been convicted of a felony for the conducted alleged 
in the civil suit 
in any case a second court proceeding would be needed to 
determine the question of triple damages or some lesser amount of 
punitive damages 
the result says pamela gilbert director of consumer 
programs for the capitol hillbased us public interest research 
group will be few if any civil rico suits 
moreover consumer advocates wince at a provision of the bill 
that could open the door to denying punitive damages in hundreds of 
rico suits already pending 
and some in the legal community such as joseph w cuneo general 
counsel of the national association of securities and commercial law 
attorneys are concerned about the retroactive provision 
for congress to say well we made a mistake and you have to 
pay the price is completely unfair

seconddegree manslaughter he was released on 1000 bond pending a 
march 6 court appearance

burton gorman iii 13 of east haven died in a fire dec 28 the 
boy was found dead of smoke inhalation in his secondfloor bedroom 
in the home he shared with his grandparents his father and a

joe toscano an inspector with the new haven states attorneys 
office said he knew of no other cases in the state in which an 
electrician has been held responsible for a fire death 
more than a dozen electrical code violations including the 
absence of a ground wire were discovered in the sixfoot baseboard 
heating unit salz installed in the gorman home toscano said

if this were just a case of mistakenly doing one thing i dont 
think we would be here today toscano said 
salz said he performed the work in august as an individual and 
not as part of a contract with his company 
all i did was install it under the instructions of the 
homeowners there is no way anyone can hold me responsible here 
he said 
to prove seconddegree manslaughter toscano said prosecutors 
will have to show that as a licensed electrician salz should have 
known that what he was doing posed a fire hazard but went ahead 
anyway

president bush visits south korea on 
monday at a time when antiamerican sentiment is growing 
dramatically with many koreans demanding sweeping changes in 
relations with their closest ally 
during a brief visit bush is expected to discuss ways to reduce 
friction and to review the friendship us and south korean 
officials say relations are excellent but they want to ensure 
antiamerican sentiment does not threaten their ties 
antiamericanism has mushroomed among groups ranging from radical 
students to conservative farmers all accusing the united states of 
exploiting south korea complaints range from claims of military 
occupation to unfair trade pressure and cultural insensitivity 
as south korea has become stronger in recent years growing 
nationalism and resentment of some us policies have aggravated 
antiamerican sentiment analysts say the united states also has 
been singled out as a target by antigovernment groups trying to 
gain support by whipping up nationalist sentiment they say 
koreans resent us interference in domestic politics and 
economy in a highhanded manner its support for dictatorship and 
its coercive demands to open korean markets the chosun ilbo 
newspaper said in a recent editorial 
the change has been sudden and dramatic in a nation that saw the 
united states as a savior for coming to its aid during the korean 
war many koreans remain friendly toward the united states analysts 
say but antiamerican sentiment is becoming embedded among some 
groups especially younger people 
nationalistic pride is particularly strong among those who have 
no memories of how us troops helped save the south from a north 
korean invasion in 1950 analysts say 
they the young demand enhanced sense of national identity 
expecting their country to play an active role independent from 
foreign pressures not the role which resulted in humiliating 
national tragedy the korea herald said in a feb 19 editorial 
many south koreans proud of the enormous gains their nation has 
made in becoming one of asias economic powerhouses feel the united 
states has failed to recognize their strength and growing role in 
the world the united states many koreans say treats south korea 
as an underling when it should regard seoul as an equal 
radical students seeking the fall of president roh taewoo claim 
his government is a military dictatorship controlled by the united 
states radical leaders demand the removal of the 42000 us troops 
based in south korea claiming the united states is blocking 
reunification with communist north korea 
students and other dissidents have mounted a wave of violent 
antius protests since 1988 and attacked us diplomatic offices 
and military bases with homemade explosives and firebombs 
it is a fact we cannot ignore that the united states and its 
proxy ruling force the south korean government are primarily 
responsible for all our countrys problems and divisions said a 
radical student leader who declined to be named 
such radicals reject the broad democratic reforms introduced by 
roh with strong american support since 1987 but the students have 
little public support because of their extremism 
some opposition parties reject the radicals violent tactics but 
also criticize the united states for backing the authoritarian 
regimes that have dominated south korea for much of its history 
the fundamental cause of antiamericanism is american attitudes 
in the past kim daejung head of the main opposition party for 
peace and democracy said in an interview 
opposition leaders want an end to any major us role in internal 
affairs including american command over most of the south korean 
armed forces and the special status exempting us soldiers from 
local prosecution in some criminal cases 
yet all opposition parties favor close ties with washington and 
agree the united states should be their principal ally opinion 
polls indicate a majority of south koreans want us troops to 
remain as long as there is a threat from north korea 
antiamerican sentiment also has been stirred by us pressure on 
seoul to open south korean markets to american imports and help 
reduce washingtons trade debt with seoul which was 86 billion in 
1988 farmers opposed to any us imports have staged violent 
protests and some koreans fear the united states is trying to 
cripple south koreas economy 
south korean officials agree the opposition to american imports 
is unfair given the open access south korea has to us markets but 
they argue south korea is a developing nation and washington should 
consider korean feelings 
the american authorities seem to take it for granted that 
people also think and behave in the same way as americans do said 
political analyst kim byongkui

that anxiety and fear you feel when the dentist 
says open up or a police officer behind you turns on his red 
light triggers a reaction in the brain that has been measured for 
the first time by scientists at washington university in saint louis 
the researchers tricked eight volunteers into a fearful 
anticipation of pain from an electrical shock and then measured the 
blood flow in their brains the results for the first time 
established the specific location of an emotion in the brain 
dr eric reiman of washington university said friday in a 
telephone interview that eight normal volunteers being monitored by 
a system called positron emission tomography pet were told they 
would receive a painful shock through wires attached to their hands 
some time during a twominute period 
the volunteers experienced a state of anxiety for 40 seconds 
while anticipating the pain and then they received a mild shock 
reiman said during those 40 seconds of anticipation the pet 
instrument detected a sharply increased flow of blood to the left 
and right temporal lobes of the brain these are located just behind 
the eyes and just inside the temples 
the reason regional blood flow is of interest is that it 
actually reflects the activity of brain cells said reiman 
measurements of blood flow is a good way of identifying the 
regions of the brain that are turned on during various thoughts 
feelings and behaviors 
pet works by detecting and measuring the very shortlived 
radiation from a tracer injected into the blood stream just before 
the test begins the detectable radiation lasts only two minutes 
three scans were taken with each volunteer the first to get a 
baseline without anxiety the second when the anxiety was induced 
and a third scan for a followup comparison 
reiman said that by inducing anxiety in the volunteers the 
researchers were able to compare the blood flow pattern in normal 
anxious brains with that of patients who experience panic disorder 
an emotional illness that includes unprovoked and inappropriate 
feelings of great fear and anxiety 
in earlier pet studies he said the researchers learned that 
patients with panic disorder also experience a sharply increased 
flow of blood to the temporal lobes of the brain the same areas 
affected by the normal anxiety felt among the volunteers in the 
study this finding said reiman gives important new information 
that may be a first step toward eventual control of panic disorder 
when we identify the regions of the brain that are functioning 
abnormally in panic disorder hopefully we will be able to design 
and target treatments that specifically address those parts of the 
brain he said 
the same technique may be used in exploring which parts of the

saturday to unite the nation and begin the ways of peace as 
filipinos marked the third anniversary of the popular uprising that 
brought her to power and toppled ferdinand marcos

epifanio delos santos avenue where hundreds of thousands of 
civilians turned out three years ago to protect soldiers who 
mutinied against marcos 
police estimated saturdays crowd at 30000 smaller than the 
last two anniversaries 
i think it is up to the leaders of your country to initiate the 
ways of peace mrs aquino told the crowd i hope you will be 
patient with us because we are in a transition period i promise 
that this day we will unite and do a better job in serving you 
cardinal jaime l sin said before mrs aquinos speech that 
corruption and political bickering were diverting attention from

positioning for power the corruption the grandstanding the 
influencepeddling the petty bickering he said

antimarcos revolt said the government needs more time to achieve 
its goals

thousands of people some curious some just 
trapped in the throng were on the streets saturday as president 
bush was welcomed in beijing 
look at all those cars 4yearold gao xiaofeng gushed as the 
presidential motorcade cruised down changan street beijings main 
boulevard 
i remember seeing the new president on his bicycle in beijing 
15 years ago said the boys father gao feng he certainly is 
traveling differently now 
at tiananmen square in the heart of beijing the president and 
mrs bush stepped out of their car and greeted ordinary chinese 
citizens 
onlookers applauded them the bushes stayed on the square for two 
minutes and posed for photos they then sped to the state guest 
house diaoyutai for a welcoming ceremony with premier li peng 
amid the commotion some chinese acknowledged they didnt know 
george bush 
bush said a puzzled university student i thought ronald 
reagan was coming to china 
others couldnt recognize the stars and stripes which was hung 
sideby side with chinas flag along the huge square 
that must be the flag of pakistan said an elderly woman 
but one bystander zhang jun said he thought bush was a real 
gentleman i hope his visit makes chineseamerican relations even 
better 
so do i added wang luo leaning on his bicycle but hes 
making me late for dinner 
indeed about 20 minutes before the motorcade drove by police 
stopped all traffic on beijings main boulevard thousands of 
bicycling commuters joined curious passersby as they waited on the 
sidewalk for the president to pass 
id like to strangle these bureaucrats to death for shutting 
the city down for another big potato yelled one man as he 
balanced his son on his handlebars my boy is sick and the cold is 
bad for his health 
lets move it lets go others yelled as the throng surged 
forward 
police did not let people go on their way until 10 minutes after 
the motorcade passed 
bush who headed the us liaison office in beijing in 1974 and 
1975 is wellliked in china a country that puts much emphasis on 
personal relations bush and his wife barbara are famed in beijing 
for their bicycle excursions around the city 
on bustling wangfujing street there was less interest in their 
return 
i dont have much to say about mr bush said one woman as 
she juggled several bags of spinach onions and meat i have to 
run home and cook

president bush was looking sunday to advance 
efforts to promote peace in cambodia meeting with cambodian 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk during his visit to 
beijing 
both the president and the flamboyant prince are staying in 
villas at the secluded diaoyutai guest house which served as a 
retreat for chinese emperors for 800 years 
sihanouk who has been living at the guest house for more than a 
month has spent the past decade wandering in exile in beijing 
north korea and paris he has frequently quarreled with his 
resistance partners but remains intent on ending vietnams 10year 
occupation of his country 
the united states provides nonlethal assistance to sihanouks 
faction and a second noncommunist opposition faction headed by son 
sann 
the third resistance force is the khmer rouge infamous for its 
fanatic rule from 1975 to 1978 that resulted in the deaths of 1 
million cambodians 
vietnam says it will not leave cambodia until it is certain the 
khmer rouge wont return to power bush has said he would press the 
chinese the main supplier of arms to the khmer rouge to ensure the 
group is prevented from resuming its reign of terror 
the resistance has held two rounds of talks in recent months with 
the vietnameseinstalled government of cambodia regarding the future 
course of the country but little progress was reported 
sihanouk 66 was driven from the cambodian throne in 1970 in a 
coup he claimed was engineered by the central intelligence agency 
he took a strong antiamerican stand and returned to his homeland 
in 1975 when the khmer rouge gained power but he was immediately 
placed under house arrest and many of his family members were killed 
he went into exile in 1979 when vietnam invaded and has since 
relied on china thailand and the west for support in the resistance 
struggle 
earlier this month in an exchange of letters with the new 
secretary of state james a baker iii sihanouk said we 
cambodian patriots ask the united states to play a more important 
and active role in the search for a fair solution to the problem of 
cambodia 
baker wrote without question your leadership is crucial to 
achieving an acceptable cambodian settlement and urged sihanouk to 
remain involved in efforts to reach a settlement in his country 
several days later sihanouk who had quit his official positions 
with the resistance a year earlier following a dispute with the 
khmer rouge announced he was resuming his post of president of the 
resistance

while president bush meets the leaders of modern 
china barbara bush planned a sunday tour of the nations imperial 
past visiting the walled compound of the last emperor and the vast 
forbidden city 
although the us first lady lived in the chinese capital city 
for more than a year when her husband served as us liaison officer 
in the mid1970s the two primary sites on her itinerary were not 
open for viewing at that time 
after attending a saturday banquet at the great hall of the 
people and a sunday morning church service with the president mrs 
bush was scheduled to go off on her own and travel north of 
beijing to tour the mansion of the regent prince 
the elegant and traditional walled compound was the home of the 
xuangtong emperor better known as pu yi who spent the first three 
years of his life there before ascending the throne 
pu yi whose life was told in the awardwinning 1987 movie the 
last emperor was enthroned in 1909 at the age of 3 but a 
revolution three years later forced him to abdicate 
his family mansion alongside a northern beijing lake is guarded 
by huge red doors and an ornate gate and remains off limits to 
ordinary sightseers 
like dozens of other aristocratic mansions of old beijing it was 
taken over by the communists who took power in 1949 now it houses 
the public health ministry 
its stately halls have been divided into tiny offices where 
hundreds of bureaucrats work under dim light bulbs 
however mrs bush was to have tea and watch a music and dance 
program in a separate reception area with about 30 chinese women 
among those invited are premier li pengs wife zhu lin 
in the afternoon mrs bush was to view a newly opened exhibit on 
pu yis life in the imperial palace in the heart of beijing known 
as the forbidden city 
inside two faded wooden halls in a small inner courtyard of the 
vast palace complex the exhibit contains pu yis englishmade 
bicyle gramophone childhood toys set of encyclopaedia britannica 
and wedding robe its multicolored silk threads still brilliant 67 
years later 
it also includes a small piano on which pu yi sometimes composed 
traditionalstyle tunes and a taped recording of one titled 
generals on a southern expedition that is played repeatedly for 
visitors 
on the day peace is restored my gentlemen i shall bid you 
return and divest you of your battle robes pu yi wrote in the 
lyrics 
for pu yi and the feeble forces of monarchial restoration 
however there was no victory even though he continued to live in 
the palace for 12 years after abdicating 
the exhibit is a poignant testimony to the aimlessness and futile 
hopes of those 12 years pictures show him in full court dress 
seated on a throne during a brief period when he hoped for 
restoration and later taking the throne as the puppet ruler of a 
japanesecreated kingdom of manchukuo in northeast china 
finally he is shown in padded peasant clothing exercising with 
other prisoners in a communist prison for war criminals 
mrs bushs itinerary is very different from nancy reagans who 
visited the city in 1984 
during her twoday tour mrs reagan toured the beijing zoo a 
temple where emperors once offered sacrifices for good harvests an 
acupuncture clinic and a kindergarten mrs reagan also had tea at 
the home of a teacher

the security demands of the us secret service 
bewildered and dismayed a beijing church pastor who was greeting 
president bush and his wife barbara at a special sunday morning 
church service 
first the agents wanted to examine several chineselanguage 
bibles and hymnals that the rev kan xueqing and his fellow 
ministers planned to give the bushes then they demanded the church 
doors be closed to worshippers more than an hour before the start of 
the service 
the security officials also had initially insisted that church 
members not to be told of the service until two days beforehand 
when in a practically telephoneless society it would be difficult 
to get word out 
the restrictions were modified slightly after kan expressed 
concerns about impingement on local customs 
western ministers might have expected such demands but to the 
67yearold kan who most of his career has faced athiest communist 
restrictions on worship the security precautions were 
incomprehensible 
it has been very difficult i was upset kan said friday as 
white house technicians installed lights and sound equipment in the 
86yearold brick chongwenmen protestant church 
they want to close off all the entrances to the street leading 
to our church the freedom of our believers to come to church to 
worship will be restricted he said after decades of communist 
suppression that is a freedom chinese christians dont take 
lightly he said 
i never thought the united states would give us this problem 
kan added maybe atheists would 
kans church located in a walled compound down a narrow alley 
is one of six protestant churches serving the beijing metropolitan 
area its single service at 930 am each sunday usually is filled 
to capacity with about 1500 people 
for the bushes the church planned a special halfhour service 
at 8 am 
kan said he was overjoyed when he learned bush a former 
parisioner of his was to come 
the minister had conducted sunday services for beijings small 
foreign community in a former ymca hall in the early 1970s bush and 
his wife barbara were regular worshippers during bushs 197475 
stint as head of the us liaison office before full uschinese 
diplomatic ties were established 
some of this is the problem that kan hoped it would be like 
the old days when the bushes rode up on their bicyles said us 
embassy spokesman sheridan w bell but he is president now 
during their stay in the 1970s the bushes were famous for their 
penchant for riding bikes the favorite chinese mode of 
transportation 
kan said he understood the secret services responsibility to 
protect bush but he added i am a pastor i am a friend of so 
many years i heard ministers are respected in us society not 
like here where you say im a pastor and people say whats 
that 
his protests have been heeded the white house sent him a letter 
late this week he said assuring him it would respect chinese 
customs 
the secret service backed off on examining the gift books and 
agreed to keep the church doors open until half an hour before the 
service 
they also let him announce the service half a day earlier so he 
could tell church members who came to a thursday night prayer 
service 
white house staffers are trying to be as sensitive and polite 
as they can bell said 
kan said he prayed and decided he should understand the secret 
services viewpoint their thinking and mine are not the same 
he said they are doing it for bush 
his hope he said was that bushs attendance would stimulate 
interest in christianity in china 
i believe god has arranged a very good opportunity to spread 
the gospel in the officially atheist society he said

a world health organization official agrees with 
soviet conclusions that an unsterile syringe infected more than two 
dozen children with the aids virus tass said saturday 
david heimann chief of the who epidemiological department came 
to the soviet union to help medical authorities track the source of 
the virus discovered in 29 infants and six mothers in elista a city 
near the caspian sea 
largescale epidemiological studies helped find the cause of 
the massive infection of the children an unsterilized syringe used 
for injections at a maternity home said tass the official soviet 
news agency 
the virus itself tass said was most probably brought by a man 
who worked in one of the african countries eight years ago 
not everyone infected with the aids virus contracts the deadly 
disease 
the news agency said heimann received full information and did 
not find any data contradicting the conclusions of the soviet 
national commission which held a probe into the accident 
it was not clear in the tass report how the virus was transmitted 
from the unidentified carrier but earlier newspaper reports said 
nurses at the maternity home had been reusing disposable syringes to 
cover up the sale of unused needles to drug addicts 
the toll of 29 infected infants in elitsa is two more than 
reported in january and authorities are continuing to test hundreds 
of infants who were treated in the hospital 
heimann offered the support of the international community 
saying it would be useful to jointly work out methods of treating 
the infected children and providing psychological support for their 
mothers tass said 
after long denying the existence of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in the soviet union officials acknowledged about three 
years ago that soviets have been infected and began a campaign 
against the disease 
since 1987 it has been a crime in the soviet union to infect 
anyone with the aids virus and officials are investigating bringing 
charges against medical personnel in the elitsa case since the 
presence of aids was acknowledged in the soviet union officials 
have reported that two people have died of the disease 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv

central americans who want political 
asylum in the united states but know their chances are slim under a 
new policy say they will wait in hiding in this border city until 
they can cross the rio grande and elude federal agents 
the number of central americans bothering to apply for asylum has 
plummeted since last week when the us immigration and 
naturalization service toughened its stance on political asylum 
applicants the ins reported it processed 233 asylum applications 
tuesday the first day of the gettough procedure and only 19 were 
processed friday over that period three were granted asylum 
border patrol officials say the central americans are hiding 
wherever they can until they believe they can cross illegally into 
the united states 
we think theyre just lying low maybe at hotels in matamoros 
with aliensmugglers or with sympathizers said silvestre reyes 
chief of the border patrols mcallen sector 
at a catholic churchrun shelter named casa juan diego dozens of 
central americans talked about why they fled their homelands and 
about their long difficult journeys during which they were robbed 
and were forced to beg for rides and food 
they also asked about the new ins rules under which asylum 
petitions can be denied in one day and the applicants then jailed 
pending deportation and how difficult it would be to reach 
destinations like los angeles miami or new york 
i dont know what were going to do but well find a way to 
cross no matter what the cost is said 21yearold nicaraguan 
marta salcedo who arrived monday with five other nicaraguans 
we dont want to go back to our own country well be killed 
because we are viewed as counterrevolutionaries she said 
well get to the other side somehow 
but us border patrol agents in the rio grande valley say 
getting past them is going to be tough more than 125 agents have 
been sent to the district bringing the total to 500 and theyre 
all working 12hour shifts 
ms salcedo whose father was an officer in the anastasio somoza 
regime that was overthrown by the leftist sandinistas fled with her 
family to guatemala in september 1987 and began her journey to the 
united states earlier this month 
fellow nicaraguan marina espinoza and her three children said 
they were robbed by police near mexico city they want to go to los 
angeles to see the childrens father vicente espinoza who filed 
for asylum after entering the country more than a year ago 
i just want to see my father and tell him that i love him very 
much said 6yearold eric espinoza 
casa juan diego is just a concrete shell with a sparsely 
furnished kitchen and sleeping quarters where mattresses and 
blankets are placed on top of cinder blocks residents have a 
maximum sixnight stay and are provided one meal daily 
the shelter administered by the rev oscar lozano of the nearby 
our lady of lourdes church has helped more than 1000 central 
americans since it opened in the fall of 1987 it can house up to 
130 people but mostly sleeps 30 to 40 each night 
mexican officials know about the shelter but do not aggressively 
seek out the central americans said a mexican immigration official 
working at the church who asked that his name not be used 
the government is not supposed to be helping these people but 
i have been working with the church for a long time and its just 
the christian thing to do the official said 
alien smugglers know about the facility too and try to persuade 
the aliens to pay them for help in getting across the rio grande 
they know the opportunity to make fast money is always there 
lozano has told reporters 
nearly all the 40 residents at the shelter friday said they were 
confused about the new us immigration policy 
we came real far and for them to close the door on us is not 
fair said nelson antonio espinozagonzalez 18 of nicaragua 
nicaragua is getting worse politically economically and 
ideologically its all orders said alfonso martinez 29 a 
former electronic engineer my life would be in danger in 
nicaragua 
he said he had traveled too far to be deported 
we will just wait here maybe until the us law is changed or 
until the american immigration gets tired of waiting for us he 
said

i know this guy exclaimed president bush as 
he reached out saturday to shake a chinese hand in the crowd that 
welcomed his return to beijing 
bushs visit with his wife barbara seemed one part diplomacy 
three parts nostalgic homecoming 
it was the presidents fifth trip to china and his wifes sixth 
since he represented us interests here as a special envoy in 
197475 after president nixon reopened sinoamerican contacts but 
before formal diplomatic relations were restored 
the bushes were clearly glad to be back and chinese officialdom 
seemed pleased to have them 
were happy youre in china we warmly welcome you president 
yang shangkun told bush over toasts in the great hall of the people 
every time you came you tried to solve major issues 
from the airport bush rode directly to tiananmen square where 
the ancient imperial forbiddden city sprawls on one side of an 
eightlane highway and the mausoleum of chairman mao tsetung the 
other 
bush ordered his stretch mercedes limousine stopped and he jumped 
out to work the crowd 
i know this guy bush called out using one of a politicians 
favorite salutations in a crowd good to see you all again 
the chinese clapped politely metal barriers held the citizenry 
back several thousand bicyclists and pedestrians lined the street 
along the motorcade route but local americans said many were there 
not to see bush but simply because traffic had been halted 
it doesnt take much to create a crowd in beijing they said all 
you have to do is stop traffic for five minutes 
bushs stop planned in advance was outside the gate of heavenly 
peace and below a massive portrait of mao tsetung american flags 
flew beside chinese flags in red with five gold stars some in the 
crowd waved tiny american flags 
a government interpreter in a leather coat was asked how the 
american flag happened to be flying there ask the american 
embassy she replied 
someone held aloft a small white sign that read hello 
how are you said bush reaching for hands so nice to see 
you 
its warm here warmer than i remember he said 
a hazy red sun hung low in the afternoon sky 
mrs bush in a purple coat seemed to be enjoying the moment 
too i love china she said on the plane from tokyo i had 
very very happy years there 
the first time they were in china was like seeing a black and 
white movie she said last time we were there three or four 
years ago it was really an emerged nation 
next stop was the diaoyutai state guest house where premier li 
peng and tea awaited also gifts 
li remembered that the bushes were fond of bicycling around 
beijing when he was head of the us liaison office here so he gave 
them two bikes one in lime green for bush a bright red one for 
mrs bush 
what a beautiful present bush said an aide handed him a 
large goldwrapped box which bush gave to li this is not nearly 
as nice the president said apologetically 
li handed the box to an aide who unwrapped it the premier seemed 
stunned by his gift a pair of black cowboy boots they were 
handmade in houston with a chinese flag on the front of one boot 
and an american flag on the other boot 
ling said maybe he would wear the boots when he visited america 
its not a habit in china to have flags on the front he said 
there was an untold secret about the bushes gift of a pair of 
flying pigeons made by the tianjin bicycle factory which turned out

at one moment during the trial of 
playwright vaclav havel the situation in czechoslovakia seemed to 
slip into focus 
during his oneday trial tuesday the short shy dissident stood 
in the courtroom next to the plainclothes police major who arrested 
him on pragues wenceslas square 
in a city where symbols and memories of the past have 
extraordinary power the policeman confronting the writer seemed to 
stand for the situation in czechoslovakia the officer representing 
the authorities and havel representing an increasingly dissatisfied 
people 
the authorities showed their strength at the trial jailing havel 
for nine months and sending a stern message that czechoslovakia will 
not tolerate the kind of changes sweeping through the soviet bloc 
but there is an increasing sense that change must come 
the economy is stagnating causing shortages that irritate 
czechoslovaks accustomed to a high standard of living 
almost 3000 intellectuals including some members of the ruling 
communist party took the unprecedented step of demanding havels 
release in petitions to the government 
signatories who asked not to be identified said they were 
disillusioned with authorities and felt an overwhelming need to 
speak out against the violence used to break up protests last month 
they said they also felt as one put it that gorbachev is 
covering our backs 
elsewhere in the increasingly disparate soviet bloc the reforms 
of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev have had far more effect 
in poland the government is talking with the solidarity trade 
union movement which it outlawed in 1982 hungarys communist party 
seems ready to allow genuinely independent groups to compete for a 
share of power 
but czechoslovakias leadership still haunted by the specter of 
the sovietled invasion that crushed reform in 1968 firmly rejects 
political change 
as a soviet bloc diplomat in prague recently noted it is 
difficult for men such as communist party chief milos jakes 
responsible for purging the party of half a million members after 
1968 to change course now 
the leadership also is accustomed to criticism from the west over 
human rights abuses while it would like better relations and trade 
with western countries it is not prepared to change its policy to 
secure them 
this left the west with little leverage to influence the outcome 
of havels trial or the case of two other dissidents convicted the 
next day 
the only thing that would bite is if the west germans and the 
austrians stopped their contracts for joint trade said a western 
diplomat last week 
an article published last week in the soviet media and summarized 
in the party daily rude pravo strongly indicated the soviets are not 
happy with pragues handling of five days of protests in january 
the protests commemorated the 20th anniversary of a student who 
killed himself to protest the 1968 invasion they followed a series 
of demonstrations that started in august 20 years after the 
invasion 
active dissenters remain a tiny minority among the 55 million 
czechoslovaks and several dissidents said they were surprised by 
the street protests however they see little future in continued 
demonstrations 
we must look for new means to protest otherwise they will just 
take all of us and grind us down with fines said dissident petr 
pospichal referring to new and tougher laws on public order that 
impose up to a year in jail or a 2000 fine 
although the leadership has cracked down hard on organized 
dissent since january it has also offered what it calls dialogue 
with disaffected intellectuals and representatives of the young 
people who made up the bulk of the demonstrators 
reformers within the party have formed clubs of readers of the 
soviet press at which they discuss economic and political changes 
informed sources say 
but unless the party opens up to bodies such as the roman 
catholic church which has an increasing following among the young 
it is unlikely to win the popular support it needs and which hungary 
and poland are seeking as they try to redefine socialism 
in czechoslovakia as havel noted in his closing trial speech 
traditional labels like socialist and antisocialist also have lost 
any semantic meaning having been applied in just his own 
lifetime to three former communist party leaders rudolf slansky 
gustav husak and alexander dubcek 
the sense in czechoslovakia now is that another watershed is 
coming in the nations politics 
but the police major and his backers will not share power easily 
with havel or the dissatisfied people as dubcek himself noted in an 
interview in the current edition of the underground monthly lidove 
noviny the road to democratization will be a long one

i know this guy exclaimed president bush as 
he reached out saturday to shake a chinese hand in the crowd that 
welcomed his return to beijing 
bushs visit with his wife barbara seemed one part diplomacy 
three parts nostalgic homecoming 
it was the presidents fifth trip to china and his wifes sixth 
since he represented us interests here as a special envoy in 
197475 after president nixon reopened sinoamerican contacts but 
before formal diplomatic relations were restored 
the bushes were clearly glad to be back and chinese officialdom 
seemed pleased to have them 
were happy youre in china we warmly welcome you president 
yang shangkun told bush over toasts in the great hall of the people 
every time you came you tried to solve major issues 
from the airport bush rode directly to tiananmen square where 
the ancient imperial forbiddden city sprawls on one side of an 
eightlane highway and the mausoleum of chairman mao tsetung the 
other 
bush ordered his stretch mercedes limousine stopped and he jumped 
out to work the crowd 
i know this guy bush called out using one of a politicians 
favorite salutations in a crowd good to see you all again 
the chinese clapped politely metal barriers held the citizenry 
back several thousand bicyclists and pedestrians lined the street 
along the motorcade route but local americans said many were there 
not to see bush but simply because traffic had been halted 
it doesnt take much to create a crowd in beijing they said all 
you have to do is stop traffic for five minutes 
bushs stop planned in advance was outside the gate of heavenly 
peace and below a massive portrait of mao tsetung american flags 
flew beside chinese flags in red with five gold stars some in the 
crowd waved tiny american flags 
a government interpreter in a leather coat was asked how the 
american flag happened to be flying there ask the american 
embassy she replied 
someone held aloft a small white sign that read hello 
how are you said bush reaching for hands so nice to see 
you 
its warm here warmer than i remember he said 
a hazy red sun hung low in the afternoon sky 
mrs bush in a purple coat seemed to be enjoying the moment 
too i love china she said on the plane from tokyo i had 
very very happy years there 
the first time they were in china was like seeing a black and 
white movie she said last time we were there three or four 
years ago it was really an emerged nation 
next stop was the diaoyutai state guest house where premier li 
peng and tea awaited also gifts 
li remembered that the bushes were fond of bicycling around 
beijing when he was head of the us liaison office here so he gave 
them two bikes one in lime green for bush a bright red one for 
mrs bush 
what a beautiful present bush said an aide handed him a 
large goldwrapped box which bush gave to li this is not nearly 
as nice the president said apologetically 
li handed the box to an aide who unwrapped it the premier seemed 
stunned by his gift a pair of black cowboy boots they were 
handmade in houston with a chinese flag on the front of one boot 
and an american flag on the other boot 
ling said maybe he would wear the boots when he visited america 
its not a habit in china to have flags on the front he said 
there was an untold secret about the bushes gift of a pair of 
flying pigeons made by the tianjin bicycle factory which turned out 
chinas first bikes and is a major producer 
what went unmentioned was that the xinhua news agency reported 
last tuesday that li qizhu a top executive of the bicycle factory 
had been charged with taking a 13500 bribe for illegal shipments 
of 11000 bicycles and with profiteering on the sale of another 600

calls came from people as far away as 300 
miles and their instructions to louisiana legislators were clear 
seat david duke in the state house 
it was exactly as the former grand wizard of the ku klux klan had 
predicted during his campaign his antitax antiaffirmative 
action antiwelfare message was out of the bag and his backers were 
speaking up all over the state 
my election my winning it with my controversial background 
has made it ok for other candidates and other public officials to 
address the issues that ive addressed duke said 
duke 38 was elected with a 227vote margin over homebuilder 
john treen 63 to represent a 996percent white district in 
metairie a new orleans suburb with 21000 registered voters 
a muchtalked about challenge to seating duke fizzled when 69 of 
102 legislators decided that he should be sworn in wednesday 
louisianas voters had gotten their point across 
my phone rang off the hook i didnt get a single call opposing 
him said state rep ed scogin from slidell part of metro new 
orleans and they said things like if you dont vote to seat 
him we wont vote to seat you in the next election 
everybody who talked to me in my district wanted me to vote to 
seat him said state rep carl gunter from pineville 200 miles 
away in central louisiana 
i had several calls people told me they hoped we would seat 
him his people voted him in he was a duly elected official said 
state rep francis thompson of delhi about 300 miles away in 
northern louisiana 
duke left the klan in 1980 and formed his own organization the 
national association for the advancement of white people which he 
describes as a civil rights group 
his 1988 run for president first as a democrat and then on the 
populist party ticket earned him little more than a paragraph or 
two in stories on those other candidates in the presidential 
race 
but his decision to run as a republican in the house district 
primary in january and his surprise lead among seven candidates 
brought international opposition and uncommon attention to the 
candidate 
and the national gop feared a duke victory woulde tarnish its 
image especially among blacks 
suddenly the political process was seasoned just the way 
louisiana likes it piquant the republicans rushed in endorsements 
for treen from president bush and former president reagan duke 
charged outside interference and said 15 and 20yearold photos 
showing him in klan robes or a nazi uniform were tomorrows 
crawfish wrap 
it was spicy like the old days when politicians claimed 
louisianians dont want good government they want pretty good 
government or when a sheriff campaigned for reelection from his 
jail cell and won or when gov edwin edwards dared us attorney 
john volz to convict him of racketeering edwards was acquitted and 
volz suffered a heart attack 
jefferson parish registrar sam altobello said he got calls from 
all over the state from people asking if they could come register to 
vote in the feb 18 runoff election between duke and treen 
now armed with a state representatives credibility duke is 
speaking up 
youre going to find a repetition of what ive done all 
over the united states only its going to be people more identified 
with the mainstream and that to me signifies a tremendous shift 
i think in terms of civil rights affirmative action and 
minority setasides theyve gone as far as they can and now youre 
going to have people demand civil rights for everyone white or 
black 
i think thats what this election has symbolized i think 
thats why a lot of minority racist groups have opposed it and have 
been so alarmed by it all

stompie seipei the 14yearold 
activist allegedly murdered by winnie mandelas bodyguards was 
buried saturday and eulogized as a youth who gave up his childhood 
to fight for freedom 
mrs mandela wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela was not mentioned by name during the funeral service 
some antiapartheid leaders have renounced her since seipeis 
death but speakers at the funeral urged reconciliation 
about 500 mourners packed into a roman catholic church in 
tumahole the township where seipei at age 10 became commander of 
an army of militant boys who agitated against apartheid 
they sang songs of freedom raised clenched fists and chanted 
their loyalty to the anc guerrilla movement and to mandela the 
countrys bestknown black leader 
the rev peter storey leader of the methodist church in the 
johannesburg region blamed apartheid for seipeis death 
what have we done in this country that a child who should have 
been chattering in a classroom or playing marbles in his backyard 
should have become a 14yearold general with the tired eyes of an 
old man asked storey a white 
the number of mourners swelled to about 1000 as chanting 
singing youths ran ahead of the hearse to the cemetery where seipei 
was buried 
mrs mandelas bodyguards known as the mandela united soccer 
club in december allegedly abducted seipei and three young men 
staying at a methodist church sanctuary in soweto the township 
outside johannesburg 
the victims allegedly were taken to mrs mandelas home and 
beaten 
police say seipeis decomposed body was found in a soweto field 
jan 7 
the three others implicated mandela united members in their 
abduction and two team members and the clubs bus driver were 
arrested last week in connection with seipeis slaying 
two other murders also have been linked to mandela united 
mrs mandela has denied any knowledge of seipeis death but has 
said the youths were taken from the church because they were being 
sexually abused by a white minister the rev paul verryn methodist 
officials have said the allegations are false and verryn attended 
saturdays funeral 
speakers at the service indicated seipeis killers may have 
thought incorrectly that he was a police informer 
during the 32monthold state of emergency imposed by the south 
african government to quell unrest in black townships police often 
have restricted the size and duration of funerals for slain 
activists 
no restrictions were imposed on seipeis funeral however and 
speakers suggested that authorities were trying to exploit his death 
to deepen divisions in the black community 
we shouldnt point fingers at other people because stompie was 
interested in unity said mclean skosane a local antiapartheid 
leader dont let his death divide us 
leading antiapartheid groups have accused mandela united of 
terrorizing soweto residents and for months asked mrs mandela to 
disband the group which lived at her home she refused the request 
until last week 
police searched her home monday and said they found blood on 
walls and weapons including clubs and a knife 
she has called the actions by police and antiapartheid activists 
a plot to discredit her 
seipei became an antiapartheid leader at age 10 when he and a 
friend formed the under fourteens in tumahole about 60 miles 
southwest of johannesburg 
more than 1000 youths served under seipei and challenged police 
and progovernment vigilantes during the height of township unrest 
in 198586 
the other groups were all talk and no action the youth told 
a british journalist in 1987 
seipei was detained for the first time when he was 11 and became 
the youngest person held under emergency regulations he learned to 
play chess in detention and tried to keep up with studies that were 
interrupted when he left primary school in 1986 
in 1987 he addressed an antiapartheid meeting at johannesburgs 
university of the witwatersrand enthralling his audience and 
earning a luncheon invitation from the universitys vice chancellor

former us rep richard a tonry the first 
congressman ever to go to prison for violating federal campaign 
finance laws has filed for bankruptcy 
tonry who resigned from congress six months after his 1976 
election and was indicted less than two weeks later refused to talk 
about the chapter 7 proceedings filed thursday to liquidate his 
assets 
bankruptcy court records show that he went to bankruptcy court 
after creditors seized some of his property in the wake of a series 
of court judgments against him and others 
the records showed that tonry who was defeated in a state house 
race in 1983 claimed net income of 78000 in 1987 and 70000 in 
1988 
the bankruptcy court filing apparently is the second for tonry 
who filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition in october 1980 in 
connection with business losses of two family owned companies 
dissolved earlier that year 
that petition listed debts of 46 million and assets of 26 
million but more than 2 million of the assets was money tonry was 
seeking in lawsuits 
the debts included 12 million in legal fees including 700000 
from the 1976 election charges tonry said in 1980 that he had not 
been an officer of either company that went under but had signed 
business loan guarantees for his father and brother

prompted iranian religious leaders to demand his death for allegedly 
blaspheming islam was born a moslem in bombay india on june 19 
1947

finefeatured face he seems to wear a permanently serious 
expression 
his late father was a wealthy businessman who sent him at age 13 
to the prestigious rugby school in england rushdie won a 
scholarship to cambridge university studying history and developing 
an interest in the life of islams founder the prophet mohammed 
from cambridge he joined his parents in moslem pakistan working 
in the countrys fledgling tv service he said the political and 
religious prejudice he encountered made him return to england 
he eked out a living writing advertising copy and two tv films 
his first novel grimus in 1975 drew no critical attention 
his second midnights children in 1981 a tale of those born 
at the moment of indias independence in 1947 made his name and won 
the booker prize and the coveted james tait black memorial prize 
shame his third novel in 1983 treated pakistans politics 
as myth and was not popular although it won a prize in france then 
followed a nicaragua travel book the jaguar smile in 1987 and 
last september the satanic verses which won the whitbread 
prize for a new novel 
rushdie has a son from his first marriage in 1976 to clarissa 
luard in hiding from the death threats reportedly with an armed 
police guard he is with his second wife american novelist marianne

philip howard literary editor of the times of london described 
rushdie as the stormy petrel wayward genius of our younger 
novelists very clever overthetop and selfindulgent in his 
poetic prose egotistical prickly and political very keen on money 
for a professed socialist one of natures outsiders 
peregrine worsthorne editor of londons conservative sunday 
telegraph said it was ironic that someone who was only recently 
inveighing against mrs prime minister margaret thatcher for 
having created a police state should now be compelled to rely on 
that same police state to save his life 
the leftwing new statesman magazine described rushdie as an 
ungratefully rich author who not only believes that writers and 
politicians are natural rivals but acts on that uncomfortable 
belief both in his writings and personal life

mahound is a businessman who decides to start a new religion in 
the city of jahilia only problem jahilia already has 360 gods and 
doesnt need another 
but the head of the ruling council proproses a deal if mahounds 
allah the islamic god will accept three of the local gods lat 
uzza and manat as archangels in his sect he can have his religion 
and also a seat on the council he takes the deal 
mahound appears in a dream sequence in the salman rushdie book 
the satanic verses he represents mohammed revered by moslems 
as the prophet who set down allahs revelations in the koran 
islams holy book and the novels portrayal of mahoundmohammed 
as a womanizer a moral coward willing to compromise his faith for 
general acceptance a conniving businessman who makes up laws to 
suit his own purposes has inflamed the islamic world 
the satanic verses is a dizzying 547page journey through 
countless plots subplots satire and philosophical questions 
lyrical scathing inquisitive and at times bewildering the 
novels subjects include societys preconceptions of good and evil 
the british treatment of illegal aliens the desire by indians to 
become assimilated in british culture and most notably the birth 
of the islamic faith 
rushdie a 41yearold native of bombay india who now lives in 
london writes in a streamofconsciousness style that leaves the 
reader alternately exhilirated bewildered and depending on ones 
religious and political orientation outraged 
the book opens with the bombing of a jumbo jet by terrorists two 
of the passengers gibreel farishta an indian actor who 
specializes in religious roles and saladin chamcha a radio star 
manage to survive by literally falling from the sky once they land 
gibreel assumes an angelic glow and saladin grows horns and 
hooves 
the books second fourth and sixth chapters mahound 
ayesha and return to jahilia contain the most controversial 
elements involving gibreels dream sequence 
during the dream mahound has a revelation in gibreels presence 
telling him to accept the deal but he soon learns that the 
supposedly divine message did not come from gibreel the archangel 
but from the devil who had been impersonating him 
mahound renounces the satanic verses he and his followers 
settle in the friendly oasis of yathrib just as mohammed 
journeyed from mecca to medina there mahound dictates to a persian 
scribe named salman the rules of the new religion as prescribed by 
gibreel but salman doubts these revelations because god sounds 
too much like a businessman 
convinced that mahound is making up the rules himself salman 
decides to test his leader by deliberately changing what is recited 
to him 
heres the point mahound did not notice the alterations so 
there i was actually writing the book or rewriting anyway 
polluting the word of god with my own profane language but good 
heavens if my poor words could not be distinguished from the 
revelation by gods own messenger then what did that mean what did 
that say about the quality of the divine poetry look i swear i 
was shaken to my soul

the nations biggest booksellers stiffening 
their spines in the face of terrorist threats have reversed 
themselves and declared they will display and sell the satanic 
verses after all 
with their statements b dalton barnes amp noble and waldenbooks 
sought to quell a furious protest over their initial moves to pull 
the book from their shelves when iran threatened death to its author 
and handlers 
but it took a statement from president bush and pleas from their 
own employees for the chains to budge in the end their 
discomfiture made for an awkward and painful drama in which the 
shadow of terrorism fell over an unlikely setting the local 
bookstore 
the decision all along has been one of safety whether or not 
to stand on the front lines against terrorism was not a decision 
waldenbooks wanted to make on behalf of its 8500 employees said 
spokesman trace urdan 
critics said more than safety was at stake after initial 
hesitation writers held rallies and readings to support author 
salman rushdie and to denounce the bookstore chains for abandoning 
the freedom of expression 
rushdie the individual yields place to rushdie the symbol of 
our freedom to write and to publish what we want said author 
diana trilling 
author norman mailer spoke of the precedent in this week of 
turmoil we can now envision a fearful time in the future when 
fundamentalist groups in america stealing their page from this 
international episode will know how to apply the same methods to 
american writers and bookstores 
one result of the controversy probably unintended by iran 
which said the satanic verses blasphemes against islam has 
been heightened demand for the book already a best seller on some 
regional newspaper lists it will be no 2 on the new york times 
list of march 2 
certainly the prominent news attention the book has received 
has created a great demand for it said a spokesman for viking 
penguin the novels us publisher we are trying to meet that 
demand 
while the three bookstore chains account for an estimated 25 
percent of us book sales their gyrations meant little practically 
because the books first us printing of 50000 copies already was 
largely sold out with tens of thousands on order a second printing 
of 15000 has begun to reach bookstores and a third printing of 
more than 50000 was begun 
b dalton and its affiliated barnes amp noble said it decided to 
stock the book at the urging of its employees and in light of a 
statement by president bush who denounced irans threats 
waldenbooks said it decided to allow its managers to display the 
book at their discretion when many asked to do so 
waldenbooks noted that it has received about 60 bomb threats and 
complained in a national newspaper advertisement that its employees 
had suffered unfair castigation for the initial decision to pull 
the book 
we do not feel that this is a censorship issue said urdan 
the waldenbooks spokesman but obviously there are many who 
disagree

as the potholed 
road winds out of the afghan capital a tattered poster its colors 
fading declares kabul is a city of peace 
this 100mile road leads from the afghan capital east toward 
jalalabad and then onto pakistan across the khyber pass 
gunfire erupts sporatically in the suburbs as travelers ride 
through some of the countrys most spectacular mountain scenery 
they watch nervously in fear of a rocket attack by moslem guerrillas 
who have infiltrated the area 
the afghan government refuses to say to what extent the 
guerrillas have penetrated but it insists the strategic road is 
open 
scenes along the route suggest otherwise 
the road is deserted except a few women drawing water from 
nearby wells and men watching sovietmade trucks hauling supplies to 
what would become the muddy frontline of kabuls defense if 
jalalabad fell to the guerrillas fighting afghanistans communist 
government 
the only other travelers who regularly dare this gauntlet are 
pashtunspeaking tribesmen taking their scrawny camels to meat 
markets in kabul 
in the distance afghanistans war machines are visible 
dozens of soviet tanks left behind for the afghan army after the 
kremlins soldiers withdrew are parked on the snowcovered 
mountains easy guerrilla targets 
at tangiye policharki south of the countrys most notorious 
prison nervous afghan soldiers wait at a checkpoint their rifles 
cocked and tin helmets squashed over their russianmade fur hats 
the checkpoints proximity about 20 miles south of kabul is an 
indication of the precarious hold the army has had over the highway 
since the first soviet armored columns started leaving afghanistan 
on may 15 
im sorry you cant go any further without special permission 
from the interior ministry said one soldier as he opened the car 
trunk and glove compartment searching for weapons there is much 
fighting out there 
the soldier who would not give his name said he and six 
comrades had been recruited recently in preparation for a final 
showdown between the guerrillas and the afghan armed forces 
following the departure of soviet troops feb 15 
watching them closely were two sternlooking members of khad the 
sovietstyle secret police assigned the task of maintaining loyalty 
among the army 
the soldier speaking through a governmentsponsored interpreter 
refused to talk about the fighting 
but he said a convoy carrying fruit vegetables and firewood from 
pakistan had been delayed because some trucks had run out of fuel 
kabul has been plagued by shortages of fuel and heating oil and 
the situation has forced some families to burn tree branches to try 
to heat their mudandbrick homes when the temperature drops to 5 
degrees 
aside from the convoys the only other travelers were the camel 
trains 
tribesmen bring their camels from pakistan a journey that takes 
at least seven days to markets in kabul but the sparse supply 
sells for as much as 10 a pound too expensive for most afghans 
the tribesmen said most of the trip is done at night because of 
threats by the guerrillas called mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors 
the mujahedeen dont want us to bring our camels to kabul 
said ghulam a camel dealer they say were helping the government 
and they will shoot us if we dont stop 
he said the guerrillas have never carried out their threat some 
diplomats and observers believe some tribesmen have secretly agreed 
to carry weapons and ammunition in a deal that allows them to travel 
through the guerrilladominated countryside 
ghulam insisted he and his friends have never carried arms for 
the guerrillas he said they never would 
we dont like them he said and were not going to stop 
this is our way of life

despite recent crashes and two accidents in which 
big sections of fuselage have ripped away from airplanes the boeing 
co still gets high marks from airline officials industry analysts 
and safety advocates 
that boeing planes have suffered highly publicized problems 
lately is a combination of bad luck the fact that an estimated 65 
percent of all commercial airplanes were made by boeing and the 
fact that planes are just now getting old enough to fail they say 
its a pure set of coincidences that were having this rash of 
happenings at this point said paul nisbet aerospace analyst with 
prudential bache in new york i dont think that the market is 
paying an awful lot of attention to these events because they have 
not been tied to any wrongdoing or fault of boeing 
they have been older airplanes in many cases where the 
maintenance hasnt been as thorough as perhaps it should have been 
fridays emergency in hawaii in which an 18yearold boeing 747 
lost a large panel from the right side and nine people were blown 
out to their deaths was the latest in a series of problems that 
have dragged boeings name across newspaper front pages a sharp 
contrast to the usual reports about multibilliondollar orders for 
new planes 
nearly a year ago a 737 lost so much of its fuselage near hawaii 
that it resembled a convertible a stewardess died in that accident 
in december a 727 was forced to land at charleston wva after a 
14inch hole opened in the fuselage at 31000 feet 
the first accident led to concern about the safety of aging jets 
tiny cracks were found in nearly half the older boeing 737s 
inspected in the succeeding months 
a lot of us put the aging aircraft and the structures problem 
as the most significant in the whole area of aviation safety said 
john galipault president of the aviation safety institute a 
nonprofit independent aviation accident prevention research group 
in worthington ohio 
we put it above security matters air traffic control matters 
pilot training and human factors galipault said i dont think 
that boeing has or should be accused of any malfeasance in this 
regard at all 
by and large we have always found that boeing has maintained a 
high level of integrity 
boeing this month said it had hired a publicrelations firm hill 
and knowlton inc one sign of its influence was a boeing statement 
expressing condolences over the feb 8 crash of a chartered 707 in 
the azores the first time boeing has issued such a statement 
before the cause of a crash was officially determined 
in addition to the fuselage blowouts and crashes the worlds 
biggest maker of commercial jetliners also has had problems with 
miswired emergency systems in some newer planes a possibility that 
arose after a 737 crash in england in january and production delays 
on its 747400 
what you have here is a series of events and the only 
correlation is that theyre happening in the same time frame but if 
you dissect each one you will find that theyre totally unrelated 
said david jimenez of boeing commercial airplanes a subsidiary that 
has prided itself on highquality work and a strong safety record in 
its planes 
with news reports of problems in rapid succession however it 
does become one large blur to the public jimenez conceded 
its made for a very intense period of being scrutinized 
sometimes unfairly and thats a difficult thing to counter because 
the incidents are happening and we dont always have time to 
explain ourselves he said 
you take each one as they come and you try to anticipate what 
the press is going to focus on next jimenez said were 
sustaining i think were doing pretty good in terms of the 
attention were getting 
some analysts predicted recent accidents and problems wont 
slacken airplane orders and may even have the opposite effect as 
airlines step up replacement of aging aircraft 
boeing in fact received record orders last year for 636 
planes valued at a total of more than 30 billion

chancellor helmut kohls 
centerright coalition would lose its governing majority if national 
elections were held now according to two separate polls published 
saturday 
in both polls kohls conservative christian democrats and their 
bavarian sister party the christian social union lagged behind 
opposition social democrats 
one poll gave the social democrats and leftist greens enough 
votes to form a governing coalition 
a poll released by the weekly news magazine der spiegel said 
kohls party would receive 38 percent of votes if national elections 
were held sunday 
elections are scheduled for december 1990 
according to der spiegel the social democrats would get 41 
percent and the greens 8 percent the free democrats kohls junior 
coalition partner came out with 9 percent 
the emnid institute conducted the survey for the magazine 
polling 2000 voters over 16 days ending feb 18 the magazine did 
not give the margin of error 
a poll released in advance saturday by bild am sontag sunday 
newspaper gave the christian democrats 355 percent the social 
democrats 393 percent the free democrats 84 and the greens 111 
percent 
that poll which also ended feb 18 was conducted by the 
allensbach institute and involved 1000 voters questioned over 14 
days the newspaper said it gave no margin of error 
kohls party has been slipping in polls for months institute 
director elisabeth noelleneumann told the sunday newspaper that 
kohls coalition lacked unity and had not explained well enough the 
need for unpopular reforms that make health care more expensive 
der spiegels poll gave the farright republicans 3 percent 
while the bild am sontag survey predicted they would get 47 percent 
the republicans garnered 75 percent of votes in jan 29 
elections that won them their first seats in west berlins local 
legislature under west germanys election laws the republicans 
will automatically send two deputies to the federal parliament after 
the 1990 elections 
kohls party lost its governing majority in west berlin and the 
social democrats are holding talks with the leftist alternative 
list similar to the greens on a coalition city government 
kohl on saturday warned the social democrats against a coalition 
with what he called a radical group that stands in a 
leftistsocialist and anarchist gray zone

an official newspaper on saturday published 
a rare account of the police shooting of nine miners the bloodiest 
confrontation during a 1981 crackdown that suppressed the solidarity 
trade movement 
the killings near the southern city of katowice have become a 
symbol of the brutality of the effort to suppress the soviet blocs 
only independent trade movement 
in order that wounds could cure completely it is necessary to 
expose them so that we could know all the truth about how they 
originated and how they were cured said the article in the weekly 
odrodzenie rebirth 
the dec 16 1981 battle began when miners went on strike to 
protest authorities attempt to quash solidarity in a martial law 
decree 
the article quotes witnesses who described how police entered the 
wujek mine in a tank and armored personnel carriers and attacked the 
miners with tear gas water cannons and grenades 
we saw the tank enter the mines ground breaking the barricade 
we had erected from pipes and transport wagons and under its cover 
a wave of blue uniforms poured into the yard the article quoted 
kazimierz rembilas a former mine employee as saying 
then shots were fired in the noise and chaos one could not see 
who was shooting and from which direction 
there was a moment of shock i heard cries they are killed 
even then i could not believe they were shooting at us he was 
quoted as saying 
the article interviewed roza czekalska whose husband was one of 
the miners killed 
he her husband never got involved in politics but he was 
always going together with others in solidarity i still cant 
understand how they could shoot at polish miners she was quoted 
as saying 
the weekly said two social committees in katowice are seeking 
permission to erect a monument to the victims of the wujek mine 
until now the wujek mine incident has been virtually taboo for 
the official media and an embarrassment for authorities who have 
justified the military crackdown by saying it was necessary to avoid 
some greater unspecified tragedy 
odrodzenie is one of many official newspapers now exploring 
sensitive issues in polish history 
last week it published a polish red cross report on the massacre 
of more than 4000 polish officers in the katyn forest during world 
ii the red cross report implicitly pinned responsibility on the 
soviet union 
polish and soviet history books have long maintained hitlers 
army was responsible for the murder of the officers

here are some average ages of airline fleets 
from data compiled in january by avmark inc an appraisal and 
consulting company that keeps track of the worlds airliners 
the figures are based on the age of the fleets as of july 1 
1988 aviation experts say that more than chronological age the 
safety and value of an airliner is determined by the quality of 
maintenance and the number of flying cycles or takeoffs and 
landings and other factors in its individual history 
the average age of all us jetliners with major carriers is 
1267 years and the average age of the worldwide fleet of more than 
8800 airliners is 131 years

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze arrived in tehran on saturday for a rare audience with 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini that promises a thaw in longstrained 
relations between the neighbors 
the official islamic republic news agency said shevardnadze the 
highest ranking soviet official to visit iran since the 1979 islamic 
revolution carried a message for khomeini from soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev irna monitored in nicosia gave no hint about 
the letters contents 
shevardnadze is on the final leg of a 10day mission aimed at 
boosting moscows influence in the middle east 
shevardnadze has refused to say whether he will discuss with 
khomeini the iranian leaders death sentence on british novelist 
salman rushdie for allegedly blaspheming islam in his book the 
satanic verses 
west european countries have recalled their senior diplomats from 
tehran in protest of the threat sources in london said friday that 
britain had asked shevardnadze to press iran to renounce its death 
threat 
moscow was the main arms supplier to iraq irans enemy in the 
8year gulf war and it withdrew thousands of technicians from 
tehran when the fighting began 
irna did not say when shevardnadze will meet irans revolutionary 
88yearold patriarch who seldom meets with foreign dignitaries 
khomeini sent gorbachev an unprecedented personal message last 
month praising his reforms and urging him to pay more attention to 
the soviets spiritual needs 
officials in both countries called the message a turning 
point in relations which also have been improved by the soviet 
military withdrawal from neighboring afghanistan and greater 
religious freedoms granted the 50 million moslems in the soviet 
union 
tehrans englishlanguage daily kayhan international said 
shevardnadzes threeday visit to tehran heralds closer ties 
there is wide scope for iran and the soviet union to cooperate 
on the regional and international scene it said 
irna reported shevardnadze was greeted at tehrans mehrabad 
airport by foreign minister ali akbar velayati and other senior 
officials 
the soviet official flew to iran from baghdad capital of iraq 
before leaving he called for the withdrawal of foreign navies 
from the persian gulf and said moscow is ready to pull out its 
warships to help revive deadlocked iraniraq peace talks that began 
after a ceasefire took effect aug 20 
his remarks at a news conference appeared pointed at the united 
states which has the largest fleet of warships in the waterway 23 
iran repeatedly has demanded a foreign naval withdrawal from the 
gulf which carries onefifth of the noncommunist worlds oil 
supplies 
apart from the us fleet the only other western ships in the 
gulf are some minesweepers belonging to britain and france britain 
plans to withdraw its vessels in the next week or two 
shevardnadze refused to say what he would discuss with khomeini 
it is natural that we cannot avoid urgent and important 
issues he said in clear reference to the stalled peace talks

a foreign ministry official said saturday the 
egyptianisraeli border dispute over the red sea resort of taba is 
likely to be settled this week ending a quarrel that has marred 
bilateral relations for seven years 
under a tentative agreement israel would return taba to egypt 
but israelis would be allowed to visit the 250acre resort without 
visas or special entry fees 
the package still needs final approval of the israeli cabinet 
which is due to vote on it sunday egyptian and israeli delegates 
will meet in taba to work out the final details of the package 
if it goes quickly we will be able to sign sunday night 
said foreign ministry spokesman alon liel 
once the agreement is signed israel will withdraw from taba 
within two weeks 
taba also is the site of a luxury hotel and a holiday village 
but negotiations over the future of the two facilities are being 
conducted separately between the owners and the egyptian tourism 
ministry 
previous reports said the hotel owner was to receive 40 million 
from egypt for the property but liel said no final agreement has 
been reached 
he added however that even if the private negotiations were 
delayed the main agreement on sovereignty and israeli access could 
be signed 
israel retained taba after returning the rest of the sinai 
peninsula to egypt in 1982 the issue went to arbitration and an 
international panel last year determined a final border marker that 
puts taba in egyptian territory 
the dispute has marred bilateral relations and tensions rose 
during the negotiations following arbitration earlier this month 
egyptian president hosni mubarak said israel was jeopardizing 
relations by its repulsive equivocation over withdrawal from the 
beachfront territory

britains prince philip laid a wreath at a 
war cemetery saturday in a move to honor memories and appease 
veterans angered that he paid last respects to emperor hirohito 
japans world war ii leader 
philip accompanied by foreign secretary geoffrey howe honored 
the 1738 british australian and other war dead buried at the 
yokohama commonwealth war cemetery a day after attending hirohitos 
elaborate funeral 
in light rain the two british representatives laid wreaths at 
the center of the rolling cemetery grounds and later spoke with 
members of the local british community 
british war veterans and lawmakers decried the attendance of 
queen elizabeth iis husband at the funeral of the late monarch 
whom they denounced as a war criminal 
in london queen elizabeth ii on saturday appealed to one world 
war ii veteran to end his hunger strike which was begun in protest 
of philips attendance 
there was no immediate reaction to the latest appeal from 
70yearold andrew burgess who has been eating nothing and drinking 
only black tea for the last nine days 
fighting under hirohitos name japanese forces killed about 
27000 british soldiers and 20000 dutch troops many survivors also 
held hirohito accountable for atrocities committed against 127000 
dutch people interned during the war 
we are accustomed to hearing such kinds of criticism said 
seizaburo sato a professor of political science at tokyo 
university japan made a mistake 
but didnt the british or dutch do really bad things to 
asians they colonized for example india or indonesia if they 
think about what they have done for a much longer period of time 
than japan did i think they should be more modest 
most historians maintain that the late emperor was merely a 
glorified figurehead with little political power hirohito died on 
jan 7 at age 87 never having made clear his role in the war 
the cemetery is on the site of a playground that hirohito opened 
more than 65 years ago when he was crown prince 
nestled in the hills of yokohama south of tokyo the cemetery 
also holds the remains of soldiers from canada india new zealand 
and other commonwealth nations and the ashes of an undetermined 
number of us soldiers many died while being held as prisoners of 
war or aboard pow ships on the way to japan in 1942 following the 
surrender of singapore 
at least one british war veteran attending the wreathlaying 
ceremony thought philips visit to japan was justified the quick 
trip to yokohama was largely seen as an attempt to appease anger 
over his attendance at the funeral 
people are entitled to their own opinions said edward ward 
77 who said he had served in britains intelligence corps and has 
lived in japan for about 10 years 
but human rights would be in a sad state if people held grudges 
forever more

adults who want to alleviate the stress 
of everday life should have sex more often and even consider taking 
sex holidays according to a draft report prepared by a 
governmentappointed committee 
the committee concluded that finns should concentrate more on the 
joys of sex and the sense of wellbeing it brings and less on 
negative things such as lewdness and sexuallytransmitted diseases 
a member said 
the panels work was described in a story published last week by 
the countrys largest newspaper helsingin sanomat it published 
notes for a draft memo the committee sent to the ministry of health 
and social affairs 
the memo recommends that people be given the possibility of 
having sex holidays during which they can forget pressing matters 
and concentrate on relaxing in erotic pleasure and satisfaction 
the notes were written by a member of the eroticism and the 
promotion of health committee appointed by the ministry a year ago 
to study health and sex in finnish society 
they were not meant to be published at this stage but what we 
want to point out is that a more open discussion of sexual matters 
is sorely needed tyyne martikainen an official at the ministry 
said in an interview friday 
in finland we have made a lot of progress in sexual matters 
during the past few decades but we need to broaden the 
discussion she said 
sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis are 
decreasing in finland and the number of abortions has dropped by 50 
percent since the 1970s mainly due to governmentsponsored 
information programs 
the spread of aids also seems to have slowed in finland the 
latest figures show 243 known hiv carriers and 41 aids cases only a 
slight increase over the same period last year 
pauliina aarva a member of committee said the education 
campaigns have worked well but she wants more discussion of the 
positive aspects of sex 
what we have to do is to be able to talk about sex in a 
positive manner it seems that whenever the subject is brought up it 
is either in association with such negative elements as aids 
diseases abortions or as something lewd and dirty she said 
despite the wording of the draft ms aarva played down the idea 
of sex holidays when our final report is published in april it 
will simply be a working paper intended for discussion not even as 
a recommendation for a government health program she said

americans lag far behind their foreign 
competitors in knowledge of languages and geography the nations 
governors were told saturday in a report that advocated having 
children start learning a foreign language as early as the first 
grade 
international education is absolutely essential to american 
prosperity said gov thomas kean of new jersey chairman of the 
governors task force on international education 
the task force report was made public at a news conference 
opening the annual midwinter meeting of the national governors 
association 
with governors increasingly involved in promoting foreign trade 
democrat gerald l baliles of virginia chairman of the nga set 
america in transition the international frontier as the theme 
of the 1989 winter meeting 
the international economy is something governors live with 
every day said baliles it is tangible and immediate 
the virginia governor added that the rules have changed the 
conditions have shifted and the stakes are high in what we do next 
kean a republican now in his last year in office said 
international education is not really a priority now in most of 
our nations schools 
he urged his fellow governors to take the lead in creating 
international education programs in their states 
the annual governors conference will lack a customary feature of 
the sessions a white house meeting with the president 
president bush will not return from his trip to japan china and 
south korea in time to sit down with the governors whose meeting 
ends on tuesday 
while nga meetings during president reagans eight years in 
office often reflected tension between the white house and governors 
over budget priorities there was no sign of similar confrontation 
this year 
an associated press survey of governors found little enthusiasm 
for challenging bushs resolve to resist new taxes as a means of 
reducing the budget deficit 
i dont see how he can abandon his read my lips promise this 
early in the term said gov bill clinton of arkansas chairman of 
the democratic governors association 
clinton referred to bushs campaign vow to resist any new taxes 
formal sessions of the nga open on sunday when the governors will 
meet with richard darman white house budget director and will get 
an assessment of the international outlook from former secretary of 
state henry a kissinger 
also on the agenda for the opening day was a session with carla 
hills the new us trade representative 
more than ever before our economic wellbeing is intertwined 
with that of other countries through expanding international trade 
financial markets and investments said the task force report 
gov thomas kean of new jersey a republican was chairman of the 
task force which also included two democrats gov john waihee of 
hawaii and gov rudy perpich of minnesota 
they called for greater emphasis on international education and 
cited innovative programs already put in place by enlightened and 
enterprising schools districts and universities 
but these are pockets of progress in an otherwise indifferent 
america the report said 
the task force cited a gallup poll of adults designed to test 
their knowledge of geography it found that one in seven adults 
could not locate the united states on a world map and that half 
could not locate south africa 
on language training the report said the vast majority of 
us citizens cannot speak a language other than english 
language instruction in this country begins in the later grades 
generally high school while children in other nations begin to 
learn a second language in elementary school 
the task force urged their fellow governors to offer 
opportunities to elementary school students for foreign language 
instruction beginning as early as the first grade 
all students should have the opportunity to learn to speak a 
second language in their early years 
the report also cited the need for improved training of teachers 
in international studies and foreign languages 
it cited the fact that several states have recently added a 
foreign language requirement to admission standards at public 
colleges and universities

lane kirkland fulltime labor activist 
and parttime philosopher offered a surprisingly short answer when 
asked last week to assess the state of the american labor movement 
its good the president of the 141 millionmember aflcio 
said with a smile as the federations leadership held its annual 
meeting 
some might disagree but labor leaders are feeling more confident 
these days upbeat in the belief that a new president tight labor 
market and soaring corporate profits mean there are better days 
and contracts ahead 
weve weathered tolerably well a period in which weve had a 
difficult legislative and political and economic climate kirkland 
said when asked to expand on his assessment 
that was a notso veiled swipe at the reagan administration 
which union leaders consider the most antiunion of the century and 
the cause of the trade deficit that has made imports more attractive 
than us products 
but kirkland and other labor leaders do not place the blame for 
the declining stature of unions on reagan alone conceding that 
labor has been slow to change its ways in a swiftly changing economy 
a labor force has grown up around us thats new in many 
respects and we have not yet organized it to the extent that we want 
to and that we expect to be able to over the course of time 
kirkland said weve been through cycles like this before in our 
history and emerged stronger and i think we will again 
labor hopes to prove it is again a major force in the us 
workplace and economy by winning better wage agreements this year 
after several years of postrecession focus on job security 
its time that we share economically in the profits said 
lynn williams president of the united steelworkers union which saw 
its membership and stature dive when the us steel industry hit 
hard times 
like some airline and other unions the steelworkers were forced 
into concessions to keep jobs the steel industry is not back to the 
capacity it once had but many companies are again profitable and 
williams is looking for a piece of prosperity 
so are 675000 communications and electrical workers at american 
telephone amp telegraph and the regional phone companies the 
socalled baby bells most of whose contracts expire this year 
the communication workers of america and the international 
brotherhood of electrical workers traditionally bitter enemies for 
the first time are negotiating jointly with the phone companies 
which have had huge profits since the atampt breakup 
wages that reflect the profitability of these companies was 
at the top of the list when cwa president morton bahr was asked 
about objectives for the talks 
low unemployment has made competition for available workers keen 
slowly driving up wages most economists believe the rate of that 
acceleration is due to quicken the shortage of highly skilled 
workers is particularly keen something union negotiators hope to 
parlay into significant wage gains in return for cooperative 
labormanagement efforts on training and retraining 
symbolically labor sees in president bush someone with whom it 
disagrees on a number of issues but nonetheless a man without the 
probusiness antiunion ideological bent it perceived in reagan 
the former presidents firing of air traffic controllers in 1981 
labor leaders say sent a signal to corporate boardrooms that union 
bashing was in order 
new labor secretary elizabeth dole extolled the virtues of 
collective bargaining during her visit with the labor leaders last 
week drawing kudos from the union officials despite some obvious 
differences on issues 
organized labor also is looking to redirect its organizing 
efforts to reverse a slide that has seen union representation of the 
american workforce drop below 17 percent 
a report on that subject was to be the highlight of the aflcio 
meeting but the committee working on the project was unable to 
reach consensus on proposals that could include revolutionary some 
involved prefer the word evolutionary changes in union control 
over individual locals

with every passing day of blue skies 
water experts are growing more and more pessimistic that the state 
can avoid an unprecedented third year of drought that would lead to 
strict water rationing 
after the dry january a lot of my optimism faded said bob 
vasconcellos resources and planning manager for the san francisco 
water department 
im preparing for another year of this january is normally the 
wettest month in most areas if you dont get the rain in january 
your chances of recovery are pretty slim 
as of feb 1 statewide precipitation for the winter was 35 
percent below average runoff was 55 percent below normal and 
reservoirs were only about 40 percent full with each additional dry 
week the chances for recovery grow more slim 
weekend skiers find the mountains covered with a powdery snow 
shrunken reservoirs reveal bare terraces of sand rivers run in 
eversmaller channels through bonedry rock beds forests are 
spotted orangered with dying trees and anxious farmers watch their 
tractors kick up dust where there should be mud 
unless california gets significant precipitation in the next few 
weeks officials say much of the state will suffer hardships 
rivaling those of the 197677 drought when the state economy lost 
24 billion the only area that will probably escape the most 
stringent rationing is southern california 
the worst case would put us back where we were in 77 the last 
big drought said gayle montgomery spokesman for the east bay 
municipal utility district in oakland 
that means loss of landscaping pretty severe cutbacks in all 
ways it is no a pleasant thing to go through 
the east bay district like the san francisco water department 
across the bay implemented 25 percent mandatory water rationing 
last year with an eye on their shrinking sierra nevada reservoirs 
both agencies are drafting further cutbacks 
they are not alone depending on the severity of a continued 
drought a survey by the department of water resources of 112 
agencies found 60 to 76 plan mandatory rationing up from 27 
agencies in 1988 
if this year is as critical as it was the last two years there 
will be considerable water rationing throughout california said 
bill helms of the water resources department 
growers in the fertile san joaquin valley facing cutbacks in 
state water allocations of up to 40 percent and cuts in federal 
allocations of up to 50 percent are preparing to idle fields and 
grow less thirsty and less profitable crops the cutback in federal 
central valley project water is only the second in the projects 
54year history 
jason peltier manager of the central valley project water 
association said a third drought year could cost agribusiness 1 
billion in lost crops and up to 3 billion in losses in labor 
processing packaging transportation and other agriculturerelated 
industries 
most cities wont determine exact rationing plans until april 
the official end of the rainy season water experts say the outlook 
could still improve recalling northern california floods in 
februrary 1986 but pessimism is growing 
the san francisco water department which serves 21 million 
people in san francisco and the silicon valley is developing 
drought plans ranging from voluntary conservation to 35 percent 
mandatory cuts 
people in southern california could fare much better thanks to 
diversified water supplies from the owens valley the state water 
project and a surplus of colorado river water 
the way things look right now we should have enough water for 
the coming year said tim skrove spokesman for the metropolitan 
water district which wholesales 2 million acrefeet to 145 million 
people in los angeles ventura orange san diego riverside and san 
bernardino counties 
were still a little bit dry but not nearly as bad as northern 
california said greg starmack spokesman for the san diego county 
water authority the agency may seek voluntary conservation but 
primarily to reduce heavy demand on its delivery system during peak 
hours

a shoplifting scheme broken by police 
allegedly used teenagers and mentally retarded people to return 
stolen merchandise for cash refunds in stores throughout the region 
authorities said saturday 
at least five people were involved in the operation that 
allegedly netted thousands of dollars in hardware appliances and 
clothing in stores from bennington vt to pittsfield mass 
police said 
the youths and retarded people were used to protect the 
ringleaders from exposure said detective robert j canale young 
people usually between 13 and 15 and the mentally retarded were 
less likely to refuse to participate he said it was possible he 
added that the retarded people might receive less scrutiny at the 
return counters of stores 
they would give them a small gratuity for doing it for them 
canale said they would steal it out of the store come right out 
into the parking lot and have someone else go right in and return 
it we had 2000 to 3000 stolen in one day in north adams 
so far two people have been arrested and charged both pleaded 
innocent 
i expect to make another arrest within the next three to four 
days and probably were looking at a couple more after that 
canale said 
none of the youths or mentally retarded people had been arrested 
canale said and he did not have an exact count of how often they 
had been used by the ringleaders to return goods 
the stolen goods ranged from video cassette recorders to chain 
saws to electric blankets not all the stolen property was returned 
for cash canale said 
detective james burdick who also worked on the investigation 
was critical of return policies at some stores where goods were 
returned without sales slips with apparent ease 
canale added that some stores were not even able to confirm that 
some stolen goods had been taken from their shelves 
the shoplifting operation moved north from western massachusetts 
into vermont and went on for several months possibly as long as a 
year canale said the investigation began jan 13 with a report of 
four stolen vcrs from a kmart store in north adams 
there was a lot of merchandise that was returned that we dont 
know about canale said

machinists and their families battened down the 
hatches and strike preparations swung into full gear as a 16month 
contract dispute with moneylosing eastern airlines went down to the 
wire 
some held out hope for a lastminute settlement that would avert 
a strike when a 30day coolingoff period expires at midnight 
friday the walkout also could be delayed for 60 days if president 
bush follows a recommendation from the national mediation board that 
he declare a presidential emergency 
employees were uncertain what the future holds 
im not really drowning in fear of whats going to happen march 
4 said ted ramirez a 25year eastern employee i still have 
total faith in machinists leader charlie bryan i think hell pull 
us out before a strike 
lastditch mediation began last week in washington to resolve 
differences between management and the 8500member union the 
airline is seeking 150 million in wage concessions the machinists 
want raises totaling 50 million 
eastern has vowed to continue operating in the event of a strike 
the company contends its survival is at stake as it seeks wage 
concessions from its largest union which represents mechanics 
baggage handlers and other groundservices workers 
unless there is a settlement or bush takes action the company 
will be free to impose its terms on workers after the coolingoff 
period ends friday presidential spokesman b jay cooper 
accompanying bush on his trip to the far east said the president 
will consult with the labor transportation and justice departments 
before deciding whether to block the strike 
machinists who overwhelmingly voted to support a strike 
sanction have been bolstered by backing from the aflcio and say 
theyre ready for a strike if that happens 
im not looking forward to it however its something that has 
got to be done said tom minick an eightyear eastern veteran 
the labor turmoil has led many machinists families to keep a 
tight rein on their finances and shore up their savings but many 
worry about making it through a strike if it lasts more than a few 
months 
we considered buying a car were not we considered home 
improvements were not everythings on hold said marti kirsch 
wife of 23year eastern avionics mechanic charlie kirsch it has 
been constant stress and turmoil managementlabor relations at 
eastern which have been tense for years worsened since texas air 
corp took over 2 years ago 
machinists blame the miamibased carriers financial straits 
losses of about 1 million a day and estimated losses of 3354 
million for 1988 on mismanagement and say the airline just wants 
to get rid of the unions 
if texas air chairman frank lorenzo would drop out of the 
picture and take his henchmen and put somebody from the airline 
industry to run this airline wed start making money tomorrow 
ramirez said 
ramirez part of a joint unioncompany team created in 1983 to 
find ways to save money for the company said eastern is simply not 
interested in cutting costs 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the program has been 
effectively put on hold because of the contract dispute and 
disagreement between the union and management on what is a 
legitimate costsaving idea 
its great in theory but not enough to put the company on sound 
financial footing ms ceremsak said 
machinists are also quick to point out that nonunion sister 
continental airlines has minimal labor costs and yet still loses 
money 
charlie kirsch said he believes the outcome at eastern could set 
a precedent for the rest of the airline industry 
the ramifications are so immense no can really look into the 
future and see what the airline industry will be like five years 
from now he said 
meanwhile kirsch says that at 52 and with nearly 24 years under 
his belt at eastern he doesnt relish the prospect of having to 
start over if the carrier collapses 
hopefully it will never come to that he said

serbians asked authorities saturday 
for weapons to defend themselves amid growing protests by the ethnic 
albanian majority in kosovo province officials announced they were 
sending more troops and police 
tens of thousands of ethnic albanians have walked off their jobs 
since monday shutting down shops schools and public 
transportation they are protesting a constitutional change and 
demanding the resignation of the provincial communist party chief 
we are threatened said a statement from a group of serbian 
activists in kosovo polje a pristina suburb 
the activists demanded the government introduce extraordinary 
measures in kosovo an autonomous province in the republic of 
serbia 
if they dont want to introduce martial law then they should 
give us arms to defend ourselves with because the situation is 
critical said kosta bulatovuc a local serbian leader at the 
meeting 
later saturday yugoslavias government said it would send more 
troops and police to the province to protect the functioning of 
vital services the staterun tanjug news service reported 
the undertaking of other measures is also considered the 
report said without elaboration 
the number of additional security forces was not disclosed 
the action by was still one step away from the introduction of 
martial law decreed in 1981 after nine people were killed in ethnic 
rioting 
the protests began monday at the trepca mine where about 1300 
lead and zinc miners some on a hunger strike remained in their 
pits for a sixth day 
thirty miners were hospitalized saturday with exhaustion and 60 
asked for medical aid at the mine tanjug said 
riza muslimi a spokesman for the striking miners said they have 
stashed two tons of explosives underground but he would not say 
whether they intended to use them to demolish the shaft if their 
demands were not met 
the protesters have condemned serbias drive to gain greater 
control over kosovo by changing the constitution fearing they would 
lose the wide autonomy granted to them in 1974 they also demand the 
resignation of provincial party leader rahman morina whom they 
consider an ally of serbian leaders aiming for more control over 
kosovo 
the constitutional change would give serbia greater control over 
its two provinces kosovo and vojvodina and increase its powers 
over defense and state security the proposed change was approved by 
serbia on thursday but the amendments must also be approved by the 
provincial assemblies 
serbian leaders say they must have more control in kosovo to 
protect the mainly christian slav minority from alleged persecution 
by predominantly moslem ethnic albanians who make up 85 percent of 
the provinces population 
saip ljatifi director of the golesh magnesite mine said his 360 
striking ethnic albanian miners would prefer to die rather than 
repeat the experience of direct serbian rule 
in november up to 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated in 
pristina for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial 
officials as demanded by serbias leaders 
tanjug said that yugoslav leaders have told the protesters the 
proposed constitutional changes do not mean the reduction of 
kosovos autonomy feared by ethnic albanians

gov george mickelson is asking churchgoers 
in the state to offer a special prayer for rain next month to break 
the drought thats parched much of the state since 1987 
i think the focus of this is on the devastation that this 
situation has for the families that depend on moisture for livestock 
and crop production in this state the governor said friday 
mickelson proclaimed palm sunday march 19 as a special day of 
prayer for the farmers ranchers small business owners and others 
harmed by the dry spell 
most south dakota farm families survived the first full year of 
drought last year but a second year would be devastating he 
said 
the dry conditions have eased in the eastern parts of the state 
mickelson said but the central and western portions of south dakota 
are still in the midst of mild to severe drought 
i would give almost anything to make sure that we dont repeat 
what happened last year with regard to the drought he said 
there isnt a day that goes by in my life but what i do not 
continue to be concerned about the situation that we are in 
the federal government responded swiftly to provide aid to 
farmers last year when many states were dry but south dakota might 
find it tougher to get federal assistance this year if fewer states 
are hit with drought the governor said 
besides hurting farmers another dry year year also could spark 
more forest fires like the blazes that hit last summer in the black 
hills and could keep levels in state reservoirs below normal he 
said

pair after pair of bodyslamming behemoths 
climb into the wrestling ring at the monster factory a school of 
hard knocks for those who dream of fame and fortune in the world of 
professional wrestling 
they pummel each other under the watchful eye of their mentor 
larry sharpe owner of the school who is known as pretty boy in 
the ring 
theyll all become professionals said sharpe 38 some 
will wrestle parttime some fulltime fulltime you can make 
35000 a year to the very few who take home 2 million a year i 
have a few here who could make half a million a year 
the lure of big bucks and hulk hogan fame brings wrestlers from 
around the country to sharpes creaky gym in this small refinery 
town southwest of philadelphia in southern new jersey 
sharpe teaches them the right way to crunch an opponent to fall 
flat on their backs without chipping elbow bones and to craft that 
ring persona so important to professional wrestling 
larrys known around the world as the top trainer in 
professional wrestling said dennis coralluzzo a promoter who 
sponsors matches featuring many of the monster factorys products 
hes trained many who have made the big time like bam bam 
bigelow king kong bundy kevin von erick and tony atlas 
promotional photos of wrestling biggies and old posters 
advertising wrestling matches hang from every wall in the gym 
punching bags and a room filled with weights allow the wrestlers to 
build up their bulk in a ring at the back of the gym the wrestlers 
work on their routines 
outside the ring the wrestlers some wearing garb to fit their 
ring personalities talk up a storm 
people dont realize there are supermen in the world and i am 
one of them said the ultimate party animal otherwise known as

blackfoot indian known in bordentown township as david mosier 
inside the monster factory ring the big guys throw body slams at 
each other careen off the ropes and fall to the hard floor with 
thundering crashes they groan with pain then quickly turn the 
match around with a few fast moves 
sharpe scoffs at the notion that professional wrestlers rely more 
on gimmickry than guts even though the world wrestling federation 
recently admitted to a state legislative panel that its more 
entertainment than sport the federation wants to be exempted from

pellets and live ammunition at palestinian stonethrowers in gazas 
rafah refugee camp wounding a 20yearold man and the girl 
identified as lulu mahmoud abu dahi they said she suffered a broken 
skull and was in critical condition 
the hospital officials reported seven other palestinians wounded 
in clashes throughout the occupied territories 
an army official confirmed two wounded including the 6yearold 
girl who he said was badly wounded in the head and transferred 
to tel hashomer hospital near tel aviv all spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in the west bank city of nablus the army enforced a curfew and 
raided dozens of homes in search of palestinians who killed sgt 
binyamin meisner on friday by dropping a 33pound cement block on 
him from a rooftop 
the armys chief of staff maj gen dan shomron vowed to step 
up army control over the occupied lands in response to the slaying 
of meisner 24 a reserve paratrooper he was killed in the citys 
open air market 
there is no doubt we will respond in this area and the 
price will be heavy shomron said during a tour of nablus the 
west banks largest city with 120000 residents 
arab reports said troops searched houses in various parts of the 
city and several palestinians were rounded up for questioning 
shots were heard in the city throughout the day saturday the

television 
in other developments foreign minister moshe arens said in an 
interview broadcast saturday the soviet union was harming the 
chances of a middle east settlement by insisting on the convening of 
an international peace conference 
what is the use of putting together some kind of international 
conference that would lead to frustrations even belligerency 
arens said in an interview with israel radio 
i think that if those arab countries that say they will not 
negotiate with israel directly were to be told by the soviet union 
thats what you ought to do negotiate directly then i think 
we would be moving the peace process forward he said 
arens met wednesday in cairo with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and the two failed to bridge their differences over 
the international conference 
the soviet union insists israel approve a conference that will 
include the palestine liberation organization an idea israel 
rejects israel considers the plo a terrorist organization

a cold wave that stunned the deep south broke low 
temperature records all across florida on saturday and an elderly 
woman froze to death in an unheated home in the northern part of the 
sunshine state 
farther north a powerful storm that dumped as much as 2 feet of 
snow on the middle atlantic states on friday buffeted the new 
england coast with wind up to 52 mph and snow while moving away 
toward nova scotia 
the arctic air that poured into florida sent the mercury plunging 
from the panhandle all the way to key west the southernmost point 
on the continental united states 
floridas rich citrus growing region reported minor crop damage 
after the second night of record cold 
but the cold snap was expected to ease slightly and the trend was 
to warmer temperatures by sunday night said national weather 
service forecaster fred gonzalez 
the worst is over he said 
floridas lowest temperature overnight was a record 18 degrees in 
the northern part of the state at the capital city of tallahassee 
other records in the state were 28 at apalachicola 29 at daytona 
beach 35 at fort lauderdale 35 at fort myers 36 at hollywood 24 
at jacksonville 51 at key west 37 at miami 39 at miami beach 30 
at orlando 27 at pensacola 31 at tampa and 35 at west palm beach 
in neighboring alabama mobile tied its record of 27 and montgomery 
tied its record of 22 
but while florida shivered dodge city kan posted a record 
high saturday of 80 degrees 
just outside the capital in miccosukee police said a 65yearold 
woman froze to death in her unheated home she was discovered 
unconscious by a concerned neighbor and paramedics could not revive 
her 
this is an extremely rare occurrence in leon county 
sheriffs spokesman dick simpson said 
the death prompted deputies to visit other unheated homes late 
friday to check on residents he said 
in other cities around florida shelters filled up with homeless 
people who usually sleep on the streets in more hospitable weather 
in broward county the salvation army set up cots in the dining 
room and put people on floors and in hallways to make certain no one 
was left out in the cold 
the biggest economic worry caused by the cold was in the central 
florida citrus belt which suffered a diastrous freeze in 1985 but 
the region appeared to have avoided the worst this time 
florida citrus growers for the most part escaped signficant 
damage from friday night and saturday mornings freezing 
temperatures which dipped into almost all of the states citrus 
growing areas said dick whalley of the florida citrus mutual a 
growers cooperative in lakeland 
he said extended cold in some lowlying areas probably harmed new 
blossoms but it will be weeks before the full damage can be 
determined 
many farmers battled the frost with smudge pots or sprinklers 
ive been out all night jerry chicone a partner in chicone 
groves west of orlando said saturday morning damage to his groves 
was minimal he said 
some farmers were less fortunate however 
david coney an alachua county blueberry grower estimated his 
loss at 90 percent coney said a neighbor who grows apples also lost 
a substantial amount of fruit 
i had some earlyripening varieties and they got clobbered 
coney said thats just one of the risk factors in farming if i 
wanted a sure winner id play the lottery 
in miami gary mehalik spokesman for the florida power amp light 
co which serves 3 million south florida customers said the 
utility hit a record for poweruse between 7 and 8 am saturday a 
time when commercial and industrial demand is low 
eightytwo percent of our customers have electric heat he 
said that uses up a lot of electricity when people roll out of 
bed in the morning and turn on the heat

peoples liberation army 
on saturday the party issued a statement urging elmahdi to form 
a new government as a gesture of good will and immediately carry out 
the peace plan

the storm that rattled the east coast 
with high wind and snow was the undoing of three men charged with 
breaking into a market they apparently never thought about leaving 
tracks in fresh snow 
officers responding to a burglary alarm at the woodmere quick 
mart early friday found a broken window and three sets of footprints 
in the snow leading away from the window 
police followed the tracks for about a quarter of a mile through 
a wooded area across a creek and up to an apartment where they 
made the arrests 
detective hc tysinger said the only thing taken during the 
breakin was a pistol the cash drawer taken from the market 
contained no money 
i dont understand that kind of reasoning going out in the 
snow and leaving a trail for police tysinger said it wasnt 
very smart

iran will hold presidential elections in 
august the islamic republic news agency reported saturday the vote 
could be a key test between socalled pragmatists and their 
hardline opponents in the islamic republic 
it will be the fifth presidential election since the republic was 
proclaimed in 1979 
hardliners who now appear to be backed by ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini are battling the socalled pragmatists who seek 
liberalization in iran and closer links with the west 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi announced the election in 
an interview published saturday in tehrans kayhan daily the news 
agency said in a report monitored in nicosia 
it quoted him as saying there will be polls for local and 
regional councils after the presidential ballot 
irna said the date of the election will be announced after 
coordination between the interior ministry and the council of 
guardians a 12member body that oversees legislation 
president ali khamenei the islamic republics third president 
who has been in office since 1981 cannot run for a third fouryear 
term under the revolutionary constitution 
mohtashemi a hardliner believed to have close links with shiite 
moslem extremists holding western hostages in lebanon said he will 
not run 
but parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani leader of the 
socalled pragmatists indicated earlier this month he might be a 
candidate 
i have not yet decided but it seems that i will have to be a 
candidate he said in an interview with french television 
khamenei who has been allied with rafsanjani noted in an 
interview carried by kayhan on feb 6 when someone looks at the 
iranian stage the focus will be hashemi rafsanjani i dont think 
theres anyone else attracting ones eyes 
former prime minister mehdi bazargan has said his small iran 
freedom movement irans token opposition party which has been 
harassed by hardliners for eight years will field a candidate if 
the political climate is appropriate 
rafsanjani and others have been trying to amend the december 1979 
constitution to focus executive power in the presidency by dropping 
the post of prime minister 
they argue the emergence of several competing power centers has 
undermined irans decisionmaking process and believe iran needs a 
clearly defined system to tackle postwar reconstruction and end 
ideological divisions 
executive authority has been concentrated on the premiership 
since the republics first president abolhassan banisadr tried to 
widen his powers in 198081 before he was forced to flee into exile 
during a purge of liberals and leftwingers by revolutionary zealots 
irans second president mohammad ali rajaie was assassinated in 
september 1981 along with prime minister mohammad javad bahonar in 
a terrorist bombing at bahonars tehran headquarters 
rafsanjani who also is acting commanderinchief was considered 
the most powerful figure after khomeini but it is not clear whether 
he and his allies have been weakened by khomeinis support for 
hardliners 
some radicals fear that concentrating power in the presidency 
will transform iran into an authoritarian state

got to talking about it one night in the bar at white oak 
plantation he said i got it out and i was stunned at the 
quality of it 
look at this kind of gold coming out of louisiana

cajun family whose name he will not make public

for generations burke said he knew about the family when he was 
growing up in cajun country and that he made a deal with them to

most of the political prisoners being freed 
under a new amnesty program were jailed in connection with the 
bitter land battles that amnesty international calls the prime cause 
of human rights abuses in mexico 
about 90 percent of the cases involve land disputes luis ortiz 
moasterio the interior ministrys human rights director told the 
government news agency notimex on saturday 
mexicos turf battles usually pit landhungry peasants against 
powerful local property owners and the rural bosses human rights 
groups say the authorities side with the big landowners and bosses 
under pressure from human rights activists president carlos 
salinas de gortari said thursday that he would free 403 prisoners 
one of them a prominent poet and activist who was released a day 
later 
opposition figures welcomed the releases but demanded a 
timetable and said there were hundreds of other political prisoners 
not involved in the amnesty program 
government officials however said they would work with state 
officials to free another 400 prisoners 
amnesty international the londonbased human right organization 
has for years expressed concern about arbitrary detentions torture 
and killings of mexican peasants and indians 
many of the victims of human rights violations in mexico were 
active in groups pursuing objectives strongly opposed by local 
landowners and by local and state government authorities amnesty 
said in a 1986 report 
the struggle for land often is a catalyst for opposition 
political activism by peasants and indians who feel the ruling 
institutional revolutionary party has failed to make good on its 
promises 
the mexican government has consistently denied the amnesty 
international reports and allegations by other human rights group 
it continues to insist it has no political prisoners despite the 
amnesty program announced thursday interior secretary fernando 
gutierrez barrios has said the program is freeing people who 
committed crimes for political or social reasons not political 
prisoners 
one of the more prominent prisoners involved in the amnesty is 
poet israel gutierrez hernandez who worked with peasant groups 
fighting for land rights in the northcentral state of san luis 
potosi he had been cited by amnesty international and several other 
groups as a prisoner of conscience 
gutierrez hernandez 37 was freed on friday after serving about 
half of a 10year sentence for robbery criminal association and 
possession of military weapons charges he denied 
officials have said about 10 of mexicos 31 states are included 
in the amnesty program 
rosario ibarra de piedra mexicos most prominent human rights 
activist said saturday that peasant organizations in several states 
have submitted lists of hundreds of prisoners to the government 
the lists include people imprisoned in the states of michoacan 
veracruz chiapas and oaxaca she said in a telephone interview with 
the associated press 
amnesty international has long monitored reports of human rights 
violations in mexico particularly in rural areas its 1986 special 
report concentrated on the southern states of oaxaca and chiapas 
where arable land is scarce subsistence farming is a way of life 
and some of mexicos most violent land disputes occur 
authorities have said oaxaca is not now part of the new amnesty 
program because it has no political prisoners the official list of 
prisoners slated for release did not mention chiapas and interior 
ministry officials contacted saturday did not know its status 
land reform was a bright promise of mexicos 1910 revolution but 
after 74 years of redistribution many peasants are still landless 
or have seen their communal land taken away by large landholders 
clouded titles and a creaky bureaucracy further entangle the 
disputes

bidders in los angeles vied with a studio audience 
in moscow on saturday to buy crystal paintings and other items in a 
unique televised charity auction to raise funds for earthquake 
victims 
the broadcast the first of its kind in the soviet union was 
beamed by satellite to socialist countries western europe the 
united states and japan 
it was sponsored by intermedbio a joint ussoviet venture that 
promotes business contacts between the two countries and 
gostelradio the staterun radio and television network 
initial bidding via live satellite linkup pit a studio 
audience in los angeles against a moscow audience of soviet and 
western businessmen diplomats and foreign representatives of 
sovietbased foreign firms 
members of the general public were not invited to the moscow 
audience which was held at goskino the state cinema 
the broadcast began at 10 pm and had raised more than 25000 
when it ended at midnight officials said 
the auction was held on behalf of those hurt or left homeless by 
two earthquakes one in armenia dec 7 and another in tadjikistan on 
jan 24 the quake in armenia claimed about 25000 lives injured at 
least 19000 and left hundreds of thousands homeless the quake in

went on the block including seven thoroughbred horses and a soviet 
tractor

prime minister charles haughey on saturday 
renewed his call for talks with northern irelands protestant 
leaders but reaffirmed the governments commitment to the 
angloirish accord they oppose 
haughey whose earlier appeals for discussions with northern 
ireland have been rejected by protestant leaders said he believed 
that such talks would be a step toward peace in northern ireland 
sectarian violence between roman catholics and protestants in the 
british province has cost 2722 lives in the past 20 years 93 of 
them in 1988 and 11 this year 
speaking at the annual conference of his fianna fail party in 
dublin haughey said i believe the political circumstances are 
opportune at present for such a meeting 
the dialogue that i have in mind need not involve any 
commitments he said nothing need be prejudged nothing ruled 
out 
this would be the clearest possible signal to all that there 
was some possibility however tenuous of progress out of the 
present horror if such a development could bring us even one step 
forward one step away from violence as i sincerely believe it 
would then it is difficult to see how the unionist leadership can 
be morally justified in refusing the invitation i now again extend 
to them 
haughey made it clear there was no prospect of scrapping the 
angloirish agreement that gives the largely catholic republic a say 
in the affairs of the predominantly protestant province 
rejection of the accord is the main condition set by the hardline 
protestants for any dialogue 
in a reference to the continuing tension with britain over 
extradition of suspected terrorists haughey underlined offical 
determination to ensure that the rights of irish citizens wanted 
abroad for any offense would be fully safeguarded 
earlier supporters of sinn fein the irish republican armys 
political wing mounted an antiextradition protest outside the 
conference the mainly catholic ira seeks to drive the british out 
of northern ireland

city council is violating the principle of 
churchstate separation by scheduling a public hearing on the 
archdiocese of detroits plans to close 30 churches in the city 
cardinal edmund szoka said 
the march 9 hearing also raises questions of anticatholicism 
as no other religious denomination has ever been the subject of a 
city council hearing the archdiocese said friday in a statement 
council members denied szokas charges and said they scheduled 
the hearing to determine the effect of the planned closings on 
detroit neighborhoods 
i think its terrible to say were anticatholic just because 
were concerned about the departure of community resources and 
community services said councilwoman maryann mahaffey who 
sponsored the resolution calling for the hearing 
were not saying theyre wrong she said but when an 
organization leaves and their services close down the question is 
what thought are they giving as to whos going to meet the need when 
they go whos going to pick up the pieces 
archdiocesan officials will not participate in the hearing and 
szoka has asked the council to rescind the resolution spokesman jay 
berman said jews lutherans and methodists have closed more 
sanctuaries in detroit over the years than has the archdiocese he 
added 
none of those faiths were singled out for a hearing berman 
said and when you are singled out that question of 
anticatholicism just has to be one of the questions asked 
szoka announced jan 8 that the archdiocese would close 30 
churches because of low membership aging buildings low income and 
a shortage of priests those churches were scheduled to close by 
june 30 although some have said they might appeal to the vatican 
the rev norman thomas pastor of sacred heart church in detroit 
and an opponent of the closings said the archdioceses reaction 
indicated szoka had prejudged the hearing 
i think it shows the defensiveness of the cardinal to the whole 
question of church closings thomas said why wouldnt they send 
people to the hearing if they think the closings are such a good 
idea

an officer convicted in the death of a 
marine corporal who was abandoned in the mojave desert last august 
was sentenced saturday to four months in the brig and dismissal from 
the marine corps 
eight officers deliberated about two hours before recommending 
the sentence for 1st lt allen lawson in deliberations that ended 
about midnight friday the same jury convicted lawson of dereliction 
of duty and an unrelated charge of appearing drunk in public in 
december 
the jury found lawson innocent of a more serious charge of 
willfully disobeying an order to post road guides in pairs and to 
submit a list of the guides to the officer charged with picking up 
the marines he was the only commissioned officer charged in the 
case but two sergeants were convicted earlier 
the verdict is subject to review by maj gen ok steele the 
division commander who convened the courtmartial and automatic 
appeal to the navymarine corps court of military review in 
washington lawson has the right to waive the automatic appeal after 
steeles review 
lance cpl jason rother 19 of minneapolis was posted as a road 
guide during night maneuvers at the marine base in twentynine palms 
calif last august testimony showed that lawson the officer in 
charge of posting the guides posted rother about 200 yards away 
from his partner when the guides were supposed to be posted in 
pairs 
when the maneuvers ended rother was overlooked by a truck convoy 
and accidentally left behind in the desert and was not reported 
missing for nearly two days searchers found his equipment and an 
arrow made of stones at his post but his remains were not found 
until dec 4 
lawson 25 of flint mich showed no emotion as the sentence 
was read in the nearly deserted courtroom 
in a statement to the court before the sentencing lawson said if 
he was dismissed from the corps i would hope first to resolve my 
alcohol problem 
there was no testimony that rothers death was related to 
lawsons drinking but court records indicate lawson has been 
convicted four times of driving while intoxicated marine corps 
records show lawson tried to resign from the corps in july 1988 
after one such conviction he also tried to resign in october and 
again this month when charges were brought against him 
prosecutors had asked that he be given six months in the brig 
before his dismissal 
in final arguments friday defense attorney john sparks said 
others were to blame for the failure to pick up rother from his 
guide duties 
why are all the fingers pointing to lawson sparks said 
what we have to do is stop shooting the survivors he said 
before the verdict was reached lawson said that the 
courtmartial was politically motivated he wrote in a threepage 
statement given to reporters friday that he was angry confused and 
frustrated 
several officers in rothers battalion were reassigned after a 
marine investigation of the incident and two sergeants who were 
rothers immediate superiors were convicted by a courtmartial and 
reduced in rank 
for political reasons those officers very senior in the chain 
of command have decided to make scapegoats of the officers and men 
of the third battalion second marines lawson wrote

the united nations will send a small 
avalanche of food to thousands of starving sudanese before rains 
cut off supply routes the director of unicef said saturday 
millions of people are at risk in sudan which is ravaged by 
civil war drought and crop failures james p grant the head of 
the un childrens fund told the associated press 
one could certainly say that over 100000 people will live or 
die it depends on getting supplies prepositioned in southern and 
central sudan before the rains come and even planes are grounded 
in may through november grant said 
its really an unprecedented effort on this scale to be done 
in such a short time frame under such difficult conditions he 
said 
grant and other un relief officials met at un headquarters 
saturday where they decided an airlift of 80000 tons of food was 
required to fend off mass starvation among 4 million sudanese 
we have some very hopeful auguries of increasing the modest 
stocks of supplies into a small avalanche said grant 
on march 89 grant will lead a relief planning meeting of un 
and private aid agencies in khartoum at the invitation of sudans 
government 
no figure was available for the cost of the airlift and other 
elements of the relief campaign but in november the cost of meeting 
the most urgent needs was estimated at 722 million grant said 
relief operations in sudan have been crippled by the civil war 
between the predominantly moslem government in the north and a 
rebellion in the christian and animist south by the sudan peoples 
liberation army 
both the government and the rebels have sometimes blocked 
supplies from reaching areas held by the other side 
last week sudans military forces told prime minister sadek mahdi 
to reform his government and seek peace with the rebels or resign 
if there was an agreement on a ceasefire and talks between the 
parties this would clearly ease the situation grant said but he 
said government upheaval could hinder the delivery of aid

the mayor of this pittsburgh suburb said 
nearly half of the 50member police force would lose their jobs 
sunday despite a community effort to raise 90000 to pay their 
salaries 
donations may allow officials to call back several officers but 
only for a short time mayor louis washowich said friday 
washowich has said he will lay off 21 officers because the city 
cant afford 4 to 4 percent wage increases recently awarded to the 
department by state arbitrators 
the citys volunteer ambulance company began a fundraising 
effort thursday with a 15000 gift and residents added about 300 
through countertop donation cans 
a restaurant planned to contribute sundays proceeds or 5000 
to 7000 eat n park manager fred balistreri said friday 
equibank employees planned to canvass mckeesport for donations 
and the company promised to match money raised during the coming 
week up to 50000 
some mckeesport churches will take up special donations for the 
police or allow solicitations for donations outside their buildings 
said walt patterson chief of operations for the mckeesport 
emergency medical services he said he believed the 90000 could be 
raised by friday 
washowich estimated that figure as the savings to the city of 
laying off 24 officers for three months but he said the 
fundraising was not a longterm solution because wage increases and 
benefits for the police will cost 110000 to 120000 this year and 
225000 next year 
police officer patrick carloss who is among those facing 
layoffs said the 15000 alone would be enough to keep officers 
working for another two weeks 
he said he was surprised and angered by the mayors decision to 
proceed with layoffs as planned 
its a total slap in the face of the citizens of mckeesport 
said carloss who has represented police in contract negotiations 
these people are going out of their way to save the police 
he also said he believes washowich wants to punish the police for 
going to arbitration washowich however said he based his decision 
solely on the need to balance the citys budget

jordans king hussein said saturday that 
president george bush probably understands the middle east better 
than ronald reagan and would be more likely to personally engage in 
the search for peace in the region 
hussein also said he hoped the united states would not let too 
much time elapse before getting involved in the stalled peace 
process because the situation is very very volatile he spoke 
in a television interview on cable news network 
hussein who met with president george bush in tokyo on friday 
said he hoped the middle east problem would get the attention that 
it deserves by the new bush administration 
the difference i would say is that president reagan probably 
had other priorities and i dont think he was personally engaged in 
the middle east problem or with any of the attempts to resolve the 
problem there hussein said 
reagan offered his own 1982 peace proposal for the region which 
called for a palestinian state to be confederated with jordan but 
was turned down by israel and the arabs 
reagans secretary of state george shultz traveled to the 
region numerous times but was unable to bring the sides to the 
negotiating table 
i have a feeling that president bush knows the area and knows 
how volatile and how dangerous it is hussein said 
the urgency arises from the violent 14month palestinian uprising 
in the israelioccupied west bank which has resulted in more than 
300 arab deaths he also wants the united states to move faster on 
its recently begun dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization and to include the group in peace talks 
bush said at a tokyo news conference on saturday that recent 
developments in the middle east had created opportunities for 
dialogue but he said the united states would not take any action 
until it had studied the problem thoroughly and talked to all the 
players 
i can understand that they would like to be in touch with all 
the parties to the conflict before they move hussein said but 
i hope that this wouldnt take too long a period of time 
the king said the united states should begin consultations with 
the other four permanent members of the united nations security 
council the soviet union england france and china on convening 
an international peace conference later this year 
such a conference would serve as an umbrella for direct 
arabisraeli peace talks including the palestine liberation 
organization and the superpowers would not be allowed to veto or 
impose solutions hussein said 
secretary of state james baker has said the united states might 
be willing to consider an international conference but only if it 
leads to direct arabisraeli talks and does not interfere 
the soviets who have become much more involved in the middle 
east in recent months support an international conference israel 
has generally rejected the idea although there have been indications 
it might compromise under certain circumstances 
bush will have a chance for detailed discussions on the matter 
when israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir visits here in april

salman rushdie in hiding because of death threats 
from ayatollah ruhollah khomeini hints at a feeling of kinship with 
another vilified novelist in a review sunday of philip roths 
autobiography 
rushdie fulfilling his first literary commitment since khomeini 
declared him sentenced to death on feb 14 refers to his own 
predicament in discussing criticism by jews of roths 1959 novel 
goodbye columbus 
i was able to recognize in myself the curious lethargy the 
soporific torpor that overcomes roth while he is under attack to 
recognize too the stupid humiliated rage that leads him to cry 
ill never write about jews again rushdie wrote in the 
observer a london weekly 
roth he wrote seems to speak directly profoundly not only 
to but for me 
rushdie 41 an indianborn briton has been called a blasphemer 
by irans revolutionary patriarch for what he wrote in the satanic 
verses about the prophet mohammed and the koran the moslem holy 
book 
roth an american jew came under bitter criticism for his 
portrayals of jewish life and thinking and responds to his jewish 
critics in his autobiography the facts 
his responses to being so vilified have been if i may be 
forgiven a personal note very moving even helpful to this 
similarly beleaguered writer rushdie wrote 
the observer quoted roth as saying he did not have to face up 
to anything remotely like the menace that now engulfs rushdie but 
that if rushdie in his duress has been able to find some 
strength in reading about my own apprenticeship in the unforseen 
consequences of art im both touched and pleased 
in last weeks issue of the observer literary editor blake 
morrison wrote that rushdie had telephoned him on the day he went 
into hiding and assured him he would fulfill his commitment to 
review the book 
rushdies review arrived by mail at the newspaper on tuesday a 
week late morrison said and rushdie telephoned again to make sure 
it had reached its destination 
i didnt ask and dont know where he was phoning from 
morrison wrote sunday i would guess from his voice that he is 
bearing up well but i must respect his wish that the conversation 
we had remain private 
news reports say rushdie and his americanborn wife novelist 
marianne wiggins are being guarded by police at an undisclosed 
location

with few exceptions the nations governors are 
respecting president bushs no new taxes pledge and holding off 
on calls for raising revenue to reduce the federal deficit 
i dont see how he can abandon his read my lips promise this 
early in his term said gov bill clinton of arkansas chairman of 
the democratic governors association 
hes so committed on that resisting new taxes it would 
destroy his credibility as president said democratic gov rudy 
perpich of minnesota 
an associated press survey of governors as they prepared for 
their annual midwinter washington meeting which began saturday 
also found most state executives urging the new president to use his 
office to promote higher educational standards and innovation 
that kind of leadership rather than massive increases in federal 
funds was cited as the best way for bush to achieve his goal of 
becoming the education president 
i think the main thing the president of the united states 
should do is to highlight education and make it the issue said 
republican gov thomas kean of new jersey hes got the bully 
pulpit we want to know all of us that education is at the top 
of the national agenda 
the governors were asked if they thought proposals to raise 
federal revenue should be on the table when the white house and 
congress try to reach an agreement on how to reduce the federal 
deficit 
they also were asked how they would advise bush to fulfill his 
vow to be the education president 
during president reagans first term governors often were in the 
forefront of those urging the white house to consider new revenues 
to deal with growing budget shortfalls but reagan held the line and 
the governors dropped their appeals for tax increases during his 
second term 
only a handful of governors urged bush to consider new revenues 
among them was democrat steve cowper of alaska who said 
otherwise we cant ever get the budget balanced 
democrat richard celeste of ohio said new revenues ought to be on 
the table but only if the president puts them there 
democrat mario cuomo of new york canceled his trip to the nga 
meeting because of a dispute with south carolina gov carroll 
campbell a republican over how to deal with the federal deficit 
cuomo and campbell head an nga task force on the federal budget 
and were to have presented a proposal to their fellow governors on 
the deficit that came apart last week when campbell objected to 
cuomos talk about a triggertax provision that would be 
included in the proposal 
cuomo spokesman gary fryer said a deficit reduction plan probably 
would be presented to the governors at their may meeting in chicago 
one republican gov edward d diprete of rhode island predicted 
bush would find a way to back away from his pledge of no new taxes 
i dont say bush is going to lead the charge for a tax 
increase but sooner or later some innocuous study recommending a 
tax increase is going to come from someplace he said 
probably president bush is going to say i dont like it but if 
thats what everybody else thinks i wont stand in your way 
other republicans stood firmly behind the president 
theres no point in putting any new taxes on the table said 
kean 
i think hes taking the rght attitude said republican gov 
bob martinez of florida hes going there without any tax thoughts 
of revenue enhancement 
president bush clearly feels that increased taxes are not 
needed to reduce the federal deficit said republican gov stan 
stephens of montana we support him in that position and encourage 
congress to look at the spending side and improved government 
efficiency 
i dont think tax increases are the answer said republican 
gov michael castle of delaware i think the time has come in this 
country for congress and the white house to stop talking about hard 
decisions and start making some 
gov james thompson of illinois a republican who is the senior 
governor in terms of length of service said that while federal 
funds for school meals and to help disadvantaged children are 
important even more important is for the president to rally the 
nation to a call for a bettereducated youth who must compete in the 
modern world with other nations 
democrat booth gardner of washington said the states and federal 
government must build a new partnership that will make early 
childhood education and development a national priority 
gardner said he supported administration efforts to encourage 
community service and i am also urging the bush administration to 
allow greater flexibility in regulations which will allow our 
teachers and schools to be more creative and innovative 
democratic gov mike sullivan of wyoming was skeptical about what 
bush could do for education given the very pressing budget issues 
facing us certainly our efforts to cut the budget deficit will be 
integrally related to our efforts to improve education at least as 
far as spending goes 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis whom bush defeated for the 
presidency cited three propoals he had made during that campaign a 
teaching excellence fund to help young people studying to become 
teachers field centers to encourage teachers to sharpen their 
skills and a federally backed college loan program 
republican terry branstad of iowa urged bush to convene a 
national conference on educational excellence and to provide 
additional support for students access to higher education

the security demands of the us secret service 
bewildered and dismayed a beijing church pastor who conducted a 
special sunday morning church service for president bush and his 
wife barbara 
first the agents wanted to examine several chineselanguage 
bibles and hymnals that the rev kan xueqing and his fellow 
ministers planned to give the bushes then they demanded the church 
doors be closed to worshippers more than an hour before the start of 
the service 
the security officials also had initially insisted that church 
members not to be told of the service until two days beforehand 
when in a practically telephoneless society it would be difficult 
to get word out 
the restrictions were modified slightly after kan expressed 
concerns about impingement on local customs 
western ministers might have expected such demands but to the 
67yearold kan who most of his career has faced athiest communist 
restrictions on worship the security precautions were 
incomprehensible 
it has been very difficult i was upset kan said friday as 
white house technicians installed lights and sound equipment in the 
86yearold brick chongwenmen protestant church 
they want to close off all the entrances to the street leading 
to our church the freedom of our believers to come to church to 
worship will be restricted he said after decades of communist 
suppression that is a freedom chinese christians dont take 
lightly he said 
i never thought the united states would give us this problem 
kan added maybe atheists would 
kans church located in a walled compound down a narrow alley 
is one of six protestant churches serving the beijing metropolitan 
area its single service at 930 am each sunday usually is filled 
to capacity with about 1500 people 
for the bushes the church planned a special halfhour service 
at 8 am 
kan said he was overjoyed when he learned bush a former 
parisioner of his was to come 
the minister had conducted sunday services for beijings small 
foreign community in a former ymca hall in the early 1970s bush and 
his wife barbara were regular worshippers during bushs 197475 
stint as head of the us liaison office before full uschinese 
diplomatic ties were established 
some of this is the problem that kan hoped it would be like 
the old days when the bushes rode up on their bicyles said us 
embassy spokesman sheridan w bell but he is president now 
during their stay in the 1970s the bushes were famous for their 
penchant for riding bikes the favorite chinese mode of 
transportation 
kan said he understood the secret services responsibility to 
protect bush but he added i am a pastor i am a friend of so 
many years i heard ministers are respected in us society not 
like here where you say im a pastor and people say whats 
that 
his protests have been heeded the white house sent him a letter 
late this week he said assuring him it would respect chinese 
customs 
the secret service backed off on examining the gift books and 
agreed to keep the church doors open until half an hour before the 
service 
they also let him announce the service half a day earlier so he 
could tell church members who came to a thursday night prayer 
service 
white house staffers are trying to be as sensitive and polite 
as they can bell said 
kan said he prayed and decided he should understand the secret 
services viewpoint their thinking and mine are not the same 
he said they are doing it for bush 
his hope he said was that bushs attendance would stimulate 
interest in christianity in china 
i believe god has arranged a very good opportunity to spread 
the gospel in the officially atheist society he said

john tower is going public with his campaign to 
become defense secretary as president bush vows to go facetoface 
with wavering senators in an effort to win enough democratic support 
to get tower confirmed 
meanwhile one republican senator was quoted as saying that if 
she were in towers position she would ask that the nomination be 
withdrawn 
tower was booked onto a sunday morning network television 
interview show and is planning a speech probably tuesday at the 
national press club 
bush meanwhile told reporters in tokyo on saturday that he will 
meet individually with 10 or more democratic senators after he 
returns to the white house monday from a fourday asian trip 
ill do it personally and ill do it as forcefully as i can 
the president said i will encourage people to look at the facts 
also republicans worried about reports saturday that senate 
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga would reopen the 
hearings and subpoena people who had been questioned by the fbi and 
whose allegations against tower had been included in the report 
said congressional sources who requested anonymity 
arnold punaro a member of the committee staff said late 
saturday he couldnt comment on the report 
punaro said the committee staff did meet saturday to prepare for 
this weeks floor debate on the nomination but the report of 
reopening hearings was not in that context 
some tower opponents have said perceptions that he is a drinker 
and womanizer and may have conflict of interest problems are valid 
reasons to vote against him even if there is no proof of such things 
thats not fair enough and thats not high enough a standard 
when it comes to the confirmation of an important nominee of this 
nature said bush so i have made some calls and i will be 
talking to whoever remains open minded 
in beijing white house chief of staff john sununu asserted that 
democrats are getting nervous about the upcoming senate vote 
tower and that some of them appeared to be coming around 
bush plans to meet with the senate democrats at the white house 
early on tuesday the senate vote is tenatively scheduled for 
wednesday 
a lot of democrats are leaning nicely sununu told reporters 
you might see some interesting things to try and reconstruct on 
the democratic side he did not elaborate but added i have the 
feeling that the democrats are getting very nervous 
meanwhile the washington post in sundays editions quoted 
republican sen nancy kassebaum of kansas as saying that if she were 
in towers position she would ask that the nomination be withdrawn 
one can have respect for the experience and expertise and still 
wonder whether he could effectively serve the president its 
something he has to answer the paper quoted kassebaum as saying 
she said she would withhold her decision on his nomination until she 
reads the latest fbi report on tower 
sununu would not say which democrats had been invited to the 715 
am white house meeting but indicated it was more than just a few 
among the democrats who said friday they have not decided how to 
vote when the tower nomination reaches the senate floor was lloyd 
bentsen a veteran of many close political encounters with both bush 
and tower in years of texas politics and howell heflin of alabama 
the decision to assign a highprofile role to tower and have the 
president exert the power of private oval office meetings is part of 
a battle plan worked out with senate republican leaders in an effort 
to salvage the nomination or at least save face for a gop 
president on the job only a month 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas detailed part of the 
plan on friday hours after members of the senate armed services 
committee dealt tower a former colleague and onetime chairman a 
crushing blow 
the committee voted 119 along party lines late thursday to 
recommend that the full senate reject the tower nomination 
i cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at the 
top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking 
is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing a 
sac bomber squadron or a trident missile submarine said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the committee before other democrats 
echoed his view 
nunn also was booked onto a sunday talk show one airing in 
washington in a time slot just before the show featuring tower 
begins on a rival network 
on friday tower met at the white house with dole and vice 
president dan quayle for a strategy session 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate meaning bush must 
pick up at least five democrats to assure towers confirmation dole 
said he believed all 45 republicans were behind tower 
meanwhile in minneapolis quayle said saturday the bush 
administration is seeking five good democratic senators to 
salvage towers nomination 
hopefully we can find five democratic senators to come forth 
and say they not only know john tower but they feel he is capable 
and qualified quayle told a news conference he traveled to 
minneapolis to speak at a gop fundraiser 
the bush administration quayle said will not throw in the 
towel on the john tower nomination 
dole said the white house is preparing a summary of the 
confidential fbi file on tower that can be released to the public in 
hopes of demonstrating that allegations against him are baseless 
tower has been dogged by charges of excessive drinking and 
womanizing as well as conflictofinterest questions related to his 
lucrative contract work for various defense contractors 
if the strategy of pressing the democrats to present solid facts 
for a vote against tower doesnt work the republicans will be ready 
with the charges of partisanship that marked the armed services 
committee session thursday 
this is going to make it much more difficult to put together a 
bipartisan coalition for defense and foreign policy said sen 
william cohen rmaine

structural failure probably caused a gaping hole 
to blow open in the side of a united airlines jumbo jet 20000 feet 
above the pacific ocean sucking nine people to their deaths 
authorities said 
although the fbi summoned three bomb experts from washington to 
join in the investigation today aviation experts said the most 
likely cause of the tragedy was metal fatigue not terrorism 
the 18yearold boeing 747 the oldest in uniteds jumbo jet 
fleet was about 100 miles south of honolulu early friday when a 
10footwide 40foothigh section of fuselage suddenly ripped away 
exposing the cargo and passenger compartments 
the nine passengers six americans two australians and a new 
zealander were instantly blown through the opening and at least 
one was sucked into one of the jets engines authorities said

the united air lines 747 that lost nine 
passengers when a cargo door and section of fuselage blew away over 
the pacific ocean was one of a group of older boeing jets under 
order to modify the lock system on their cargo doors 
failure of the door was one of several possibilities 
investigators were exploring today as cause for the gaping hole in 
united flight 811 when it returned to honolulu after taking off on a 
flight to auckland new zealand 
other possibilities included structural failure an engine 
problem that sent parts flying into the fuselage or a bomb 
a july 1 1988 airworthiness directive from the federal 
aviation administration gave airlines with 156 of the early jumbo 
jets from 30 to 90 days to conduct inspections and any necessary 
repairs depending on the type of door lock they have they were 
also given from 18 to 24 months to make modifications to improve the 
door lock system 
united public relations officials did not return a call late 
friday to inquire whether the damaged airliners cargo doors had 
been inspected or whether the ordered alteration had been made on 
that or other united 747s the airline would have had at least 
another 10 months to make the improvement

the programs in the 136 billion collection of government agencies 
for which the administration is seeking savings of 10 billion 
democratic critics have charged that the administration purposely 
has left the savings in this area of nondefense programs

antiamericanism has mushroomed among groups ranging from radical 
students to conservative farmers all accusing the united states of 
exploiting south korea complaints range from claims of military 
occupation to unfair trade pressure and cultural insensitivity 
as south korea has become stronger in recent years growing

been singled out as a target by antigovernment groups trying to

tightening the choke chain around economic growth 
isnt the only way the federal reserve is exerting authority its 
also warning banks to more aggressively monitor their lending for 
debtfinanced takeovers 
a spike in the feds key discount rate loan fee and its other 
antiinflationary moves this past week came as the nations central 
bank took another important step the fed implemented tightened 
guidelines for banks specifying which debtfinanced acquisitions 
might be too risky for them 
under these guidelines loans to borrowers with debt that is more 
than triple their equity are considered highly leveraged 
financings which means they probably will face increased scrutiny 
by federal bank examiners 
it also means that bank lending in the unprecedented onslaught of 
corporate acquisitions financed largely by debt will decline 
takeover experts speculated 
in addition the guidelines instruct bankers to carefully assess 
their companywide exposure in debtfinanced takeovers before 
committing to additional loans for such activity 
banks increasingly have become important financiers of the 
takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or lbo in which a 
buyer borrows most of the purchase money for a company and repays it 
through the companys earnings asset sales or a combination of both 
a 1988 fed survey suggested that 15 percent of commercial and 
industrial loans were related to lbos and other types of takeovers 
and at some big banks the figure was as high as 40 percent 
one reason banks have plunged into the lbo business is the high 
rate of interest they may charge for the loans the growing risk 
however is that a substantial portion of these loans could default 
if the debtburdened borrowers face a downturn in their business 
fed regulators sensitive to how many banks recklessly loaned 
money to third world nations and speculative southwest real estate 
ventures in years past are concerned that the lbo binge is deja vu 
they also are particularly mindful of the crisis plaguing the 
savings and loan industry which has left many thrifts insolvent due 
to risky loans that went bad the crisis has bankrupted the federal 
agency that insures thrifts and could cost more than 100 billion in 
government bailout assistance 
alan greenspan the fed chairman said he was troubled by bank 
lending for lbos late last year after a spree of multibillion dollar 
deals was announced including the record 2453 billion takeover of 
rjr nabisco inc 
while greenspan did not suggest the government restrict such 
takeovers he said banks carefully should evaluate their involvement 
in them 
even if us banks cut their exposure to lborelated loans 
because of the new fed guidelines some experts believe that wont 
deter the pace of debtfinanced takeovers there are many other 
alternate sources of financing including wall street investment 
firms and foreign banks 
i can understand why the fed did this but its misguided 
said yakov amihud a professor of finance and lbo expert at new york 
universitys leonard n stern school of business bank 
participation will decline but others will jump into the void 
in other business and economic news this past week 
fears of inflation intensified particularly because of a labor 
department report that showed consumer prices surged 06 percent in 
january the biggest rise in two years financial markets slumped 
and banks raised their prime lending rate to a fouryear high of 
115 percent

management at moneylosing eastern airlines hurtled toward a march 4

the latest round of bad inflation news and 
interestrate increases caught stock market investors with their 
guard down 
the 06 percent rise in the consumer price index for january 
reported on tuesday didnt come without any advance warning 
after all figures issued earlier had shown a 1 percent increase 
for the same month in the producer price index of finished goods 
and the federal reserves move friday to raise its discount rate 
from 65 percent to 7 percent had been discussed on wall street for 
months as a likely possibility 
indeed some analysts had thought the fed might raise the rate 
charged on loans to private financial institutions to 75 percent 
yet stocks sold off sharply on both developments in wall streets 
rockiest week so far in 1989 
the problem analysts said was that the news hit at a time when 
increasing numbers of investors were embracing the idea that the fed 
was on the inflation case and would have it successfully resolved 
before long 
money managers who had formerly been taking a cautious defensive 
approach found themselves drawn into a new performance race as stock 
prices rose and they chased after the market with buy orders 
the biggest risk began to be perceived as being underinvested 
in a rally rather than the perils of a declining market 
as the bank credit analyst a forecasting firm put it before the 
storm hit bond and stock market investors are not prepared for 
another turn of the credit screws 
now the latest rate increases have raised some new questions or 
at least reemphasized some old ones can the fed restrain inflation 
without inflicting some significant pain on the economy 
or is that an impossible mission like saying you are going on a 
diet and hoping to lose 15 pounds without cutting down on any of 
your favorite foods 
the challenge facing the fed is to tighten policy enough to 
calm inflation but not enough to send the economy into a 
recession said jack lavery research chief at merrill lynch amp co 
the unpredictable delay between monetary tightening and a 
slowing in economic activity makes that more difficult 
the extent of the new worries was readily event in the past 
weeks market numbers the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
closed friday at 224554 down 7928 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 473 to 16172 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market dropped 
723 to 39996 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 446 at 32149 
volume on the big board averaged 15403 million shares a day

after months of criticism for too much talk and 
too little action the federal reserve board finally punctuated its 
antiinflation rhetoric by hoisting shortterm interest rates and 
draining reserves from the banking system 
but some analysts say the central bank may eschew truly bold 
maneuvers in its inflation battle not wanting to risk recession at 
a time of unprecedented problems in the savings and loan industry 
the actions last week demonstrated the central banks 
independence from the bush administration which has resisted the 
notion that inflation has veered dangerously out of control and 
brakes should be applied in the form of higher interest rates 
to some analysts the board seemed to be abandoning its strategy 
of gradually defusing inflationary pressures through small 
incremental increases in interest rates 
the evidence they cite is an increase in the federal funds rate 
a closely watched interest charge that affects banks borrowing 
costs 
over much of the past year the key rate crept up slowly from 
just under 6 percent in january 1988 lately its pace has quickened 
sharply and by the end of last week it was quoted at 9 percent the 
fed essentially forced the rate up by sucking federal funds out of 
the system 
in addition on friday the fed raised its discount rate which is 
the interest the central bank charges on loans to commercial banking 
institutions 
the increase to 7 percent from 65 percent was seen as a symbolic 
gesture underscoring the upward trend in shortterm rates it 
followeddecisions by the countrys commercial banks to hike their 
prime lending rates benchmarks on which interest rates for many 
consumer and business loans are based 
while some analysts were applauding the fed for administering a 
dose of muchneeded monetary restraint others were unsatisfied with 
the strength of the medicine the doubters are so troubled by 
inflation that they believe the fed should wage a much more 
aggressive fight 
the debate may be academic 
a number of analysts say the central bank may be kept from 
tackling inflation as forcefully as it would like because to do so 
might endanger economic growth which could have disastrous 
consequences 
a recession would compound the troubles in the savings and loan 
industry possibly bringing down insurance companies in the process 
analysts contend in addition a recession would make the debt 
burdens of consumers businesses and the government more costly to 
bear 
i do not expect the fed to raise interest rates significantly 
higher this year said albert a gross a senior vice president at 
refco inc the problems in the thrift industry and the emerging 
problems in the insurance industry will limit the feds willingness 
to push interest rates higher 
i think the gradualism that the fed is following is a practical 
compromise he said 
consumers may take comfort in his opinion about interest rates 
the implications for inflation however are less soothing 
allen sinai chief economist at boston co finds the latest 
inflation signs distressing 
there are signs that an inflationary spiral has begun this is 
worrisome because once inflation starts to spiral it becomes very 
difficult to reverse without significant financial restrictions on 
the part of the federal reseve sinai said 
the labor department reported last week that consumer prices shot 
up 06 percent in january or the equivalent of a 72 percent annual 
rate by contrast the consumer price index rose 11 percent in 1986 
prices at the wholesale level are surging too implying that 
retail prices in the months ahead will move higher 
consumers are going to be slowly squeezed by both higher 
interest rates and inflation sinai said the message is the 
central bank wants consumers to slow down spending 
everyone is raising their inflation expectations said donald 
ratajczak head of the economic forecaster center at georgia state 
university the fed is now starting to make a moderate response 
half the cows are out of the barn but its still worthwhile to close 
the gate before all of them are gone 
by pursuing its gradual approach in the past the fed made the 
problem worse ratajczak said what they should have done is take 
swift dramatic action 
the fed always follows gradualism and it never works and you 
have to ask after awhiledont they read their own history

importstarved consumers are on a spree 
buying candy and washing machines from the united states french 
wines and lingerie spanish ceramic tile japanese stereos even 
watering cans from australia 
mexicos fledgling open market policy which includes greatly 
reduced import duties has incited the biggest change in shopping 
habits this country has seen in decades 
its like being in the united states shopper hector juarez 
said as he roamed imagine a 3monthold store offering 
stateoftheart household goods and sophisticated novelty items 
from around the world 
mexicans who wanted a microwave oven or an american refrigerator 
used to patronize a black market but within the last year that has 
changed 
we bought a whirlpool washing machine from a local dealer its 
nice to have the option said juarez 
another new store offers the latest in electronic goods and major 
appliances from the united states japan and west germany while 
huge signs announcing imported merchandise point the way to new 
foreign goods sections in supermarkets and department stores 
in mexico city imported bottled water has become the latest 
fancy of the middle and upper classes 
mexicos former industrial protection policy required import 
duties of up to 100 percent with few exceptions the restriction 
effectively denied consumers access to foreignmade products by 
making them too expensive 
as a result consumers complained national manufacturers got 
greedy and lazy charging exorbitant prices for inferior merchandise 
and rarely bothering to expand product lines 
but mexico facing skyrocking inflation that reached 167 percent 
in 1987 joined the international general agreement on tariffs and 
trade in 1986 lowering import duties to 20 percent or less 
the change was aimed partly at forcing domestic producers to 
reduce prices and raise quality another goal was to increase 
exports of manufactured goods by letting producers import raw 
materials more cheaply 
the boom in consumer imports has been escalating since mid1988 
its helped control inflation because mexican manufacturers 
cant raise prices because the products coming from the other side 
are cheaper said jose luis mastretta a chamber of commerce 
official in monterrey northern mexicos largest and richest city 
inflation fell to about 50 percent in 1988 
under the relaxed tariffs most foreign items cost an average of 
5 percent to 35 percent above what they might cost in the united 
states 
an american candy bar costs about 55 cents while a compact disc 
that sells for about 16 in the united states goes for 19 here 
people here are used to spending in dollars and they 
automatically compare prices said imagine manager miguel 
longoria theyll pay 25 to 30 percent above us prices but if 
its more theyll go to the other side of the border 
from the united states imports include cake mixes clothes 
compact discs barbecue grills furniture refrigerators and washing 
machines 
total imports from january through october of 1988 increased by 
55 percent to 152 billion compared with the same period in 1987 
bank of mexico statistics show imports of consumer goods alone grew 
by 150 percent 
the higher imports hurt mexicos balance of payments at the end 
of 1988 reducing what had been a strong surplus nonetheless 
business economists dont expect a prolonged bout of voracious 
import consumption because many mexicans simply dont have the money 
its not an invasion of products because the buying power of 
the the average mexican is very limited were still in a 
recession mastretta said 
most of the consumer goods sold here are aimed at middleand 
upperclass consumers only about 25 percent of the population 
nevertheess those with a choice are buying imports salesmen said 
the client who comes in to buy a refrigerator is going to leave 
with an american one said juan angel rodriguez manager of the 
liverpool department stores appliance department 
rodriguez said 80 percent of the refrigerators washing machines 
dryers and stoves he sells are american although mexican prices are 
becoming competitive manufacturers have not yet raised quality to 
match the imports 
people are demanding higher quality what they get with the 
national brands are breakdowns breakdowns breakdowns rodriguez 
said 
at liverpool an imported speed queed clothes dryer with 18pound 
capacity and digital controls cost 680 the closest mexicanmade 
equivalent an easy brand nondigital 11pound dryer cost 600 
a mexicanmade washing machine that used to cost the equivalent 
of 608 now has been reduced to about 470 an imported maytag 
washing machine was on sale for the same price

increases in key lending rates by commercial 
banks and the federal reserve triggered the biggest stock market 
setback in three months and sent bond prices lower 
in the stock market the dow jones industrial average skidded 
4392 points to close friday at 224554 it was the biggest daily 
drop since november 
in the broader market seven stocks fell for every two that rose 
among issues listed on the new york stock exchange 
bond prices lost as much as 4 for every 1000 in face value 
sending interest rates higher with yields on 30year bonds climbing 
to 918 percent from 914 percent late thursday 
shortterm interest rates finished even higher oneyear treasury 
bills were yielding 950 percent late friday offering investors a 
powerful incentive to dump stocks 
the dollar finished mixed in foreign exchange trading 
gary schlossberg senior economist for wells fargo bank in san 
francisco said he expects interest rates will move even higher 
before the economy slows enough to relieve inflationary pressures a 
goal the fed has set for itself 
the fed will will have to continue to tighten a bit more 
aggressively a modest interest rate increase on the order of one 
percentage point should be enough to cool the economy off 
sufficiently he said 
such a move would increase chances that the economy could fall 
into a recession another worry for stock investors trying to divine 
the outlook for corporate profits 
but schlossberg said he believes the economy has enough 
inherent strength that there is a better than even chance a 
recession will avoided 
before the stock market opened friday the federal reserve 
boosted its discount rate its charge on loans to member banks by a 
half percentage point to a threeyear high of 7 percent 
boosting the discount rate is the central banks most dramatic 
signal that it intends to tighten credit and slow economic growth 
thus reducing borrowing wage and price demands 
some analysts said the feds move was overdue especially in 
light of federal reserve chairman alan greenspans statements that 
he found recent inflation disturbing and that the bank would 
continue erring on the side of retraint in fighting it 
fears about accelerating inflation have heightened in recent 
weeks with news that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in january 
and that consumer prices were up 06 percent last month their 
biggest jump in two years 
until friday the central banks moves had largely been conducted 
behind the scenes such as the draining of reserves from the banking 
system a maneuver that forces some banks to borrow to meet capital 
requirements 
the discount rate hike followed chase manhattan banks 
announcement after the stock market closed on thursday that it was 
boosting its prime lending rate a benchmark lending charge that 
affects rates paid on commercial home and other consumer loans to 
11 percent from 11 percent 
other major banks matched chases increase on friday it was the 
second half percentage point rise in the prime rate in the last two 
weeks 
the fed last raised the discount rate in august to 65 percent 
from 6 percent the discount rate last was at 7 percent from march 
7 1986 to april 18 1986 when it dropped to 65 percent

a help wanted sign inside the beatup 
airplane hangar that serves as headquarters for united express 
announces openings for mechanics accountants and pilots 
it symbolizes the rapid growth of the pascobased airline 
challenging horizon air for dominance in what has become one of the 
countrys hottest airline competitions the struggle for the pacific 
northwest commuter business 
the fierceness of the competition is illustrated in the 
yakimaseattle route where passengers have a choice of seven direct 
flights on united express or eight on horizon air each business day 
officials for horizon and united express insist the skies over 
the economically prosperous area are big enough for two airlines 
but horizon has been feeling the heat in markets like yakima served 
by both 
horizon essentially has negative growth said bill whitlow a 
stock analyst for dain bosworth inc a seattlebased securities 
firm that was a result of united express 
horizon president john kelly believes the competition is boosting 
overall airplane ridership in the northwest 
he noted horizons slight increase in passengers from 138 
million in 1987 to 139 million in 1988 despite united express 
boardings of 363206 passengers during its first full year of 
operations 
they offer a good product and we offer a good product said 
john beacham director of marketing for united express it 
encourages flying 
unlike other airline competitions however passengers have not 
benefited from any fare wars a roundtrip cost for the 20minute 
flight from yakima to seattle is pegged at 130 to 178 for both 
airlines depending on discounts 
whitlow said that reflects the relatively equal competitive 
standing of the two airlines and their strong ties to larger 
carriers 
united express is affiliated with united airlines which is no 1 
in the seattle market and no 2 in portland horizon is owned by 
alaska air group inc no 1 in portland and no 2 in seattle 
whitlow said 
neither has to cut fares to attract customers he said 
there is no question that seattlebased horizon has been feeling 
the heat 
in yakima its boardings dropped from 52112 in 1987 to 40022 in 
1988 according to yakima airport manager gary robbins 
that decline can be attributed to united express 23320 
boardings in yakima robbins said 
we have been profitable in yakima from the first month of 
operation beacham said 
the northwest has some very good customer service compared to 
other parts of the nation he said 
indeed outposts like moses lake and pullman wash lewiston 
idaho kalispell mont and coos bay ore enjoy regularly 
scheduled air service on at least one of the commuters 
horizon formed with a seattleyakima route in 1981 is much 
larger with 41 aircraft serving 30 cities in washington oregon 
montana idaho and utah it has 1400 employees compared with about 
400 for united express 
already spread into many smaller communities in the northwest 
kelly says the carrier is considering expansion into california 
where it would provide feeder traffic for alaska airlines flights in 
san francisco and los angeles 
united express on the other hand serves 13 cities in 
washington oregon idaho and montana and its expansion plans 
center on breaking into horizons markets 
one of five commuter airlines across the country that fly under 
the marketing name owned by giant united airlines united express is 
owned and operated by westair holdings inc of fresno calif 
united owns no equity in united express but the commuter is tied 
in with uniteds reservation and frequent flyer system and fare 
structure and the planes are painted with the same colors 
united expresss main mission is to feed passengers from smaller 
communities to uniteds jet operations at seattle portland and 
spokane beacham said the company also plans to serve boise idaho 
started in july 1987 with one jetstream 31 19seater flying from 
pasco to seattle united express now has 16 jetstreams and has 
ordered eight 30passenger embraer brasilia jetprops in a 48 
million deal 
for both airlines the hottest battle is probably the 
seattleportland shuttle run 
united express offers 20 roundtrips per day and plans to up that 
to 23 in march horizon offers over 30 flights between the cities 
most days
