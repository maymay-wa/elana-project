voters sunday overwhelmingly approved 
constitutional reforms that would legalize marxist political 
activities and reduce presidential powers according to partial 
official returns 
president augusto pinochet the army commander and head of the 
military government called the vote historic and said it has 
shown the chilean peoples capacity to reach national unity 
the armed forces which have ruled chile for nearly 16 years 
have vowed in a solmen manner to ensure that the constitution 
will be respected by all citizens he said in a nationally 
televised address 
the government and the opposition support the proposed reforms 
which drew little voter interest prior to the balloting 
the government said that with 14109 of the nations 23000 
polling stations reporting the referendum was passing by a vote of 
676933 to 363926 256687 ballots were invalid or blank 
there were 54 proposed constitutional changes in the package 
presented to the voters 
andres zaldivar president of the centrist christian democratic 
party that is the largest opposition group said the reforms 
allow us to begin the construction of a real democracy 
but he reiterated his position that further reforms are needed 
 
delays were reported in the opening of some polling stations 
around the country authorities blamed bad weather especially in 
the south and a lack of public transportation in santiago and some 
other cities 
the government reported virtually all of the polls were open by 
midmorning it said voting slow during the early hours increased 
during the day and that 80 percent of the eligible voters cast 
ballots in some districts 
voting is mandatory and citizens who fail to cast a ballot may 
be fined more than 90 a steep amount in a country where about a 
third of the 45 million labor force earns the 66 monthly minimum 
wage 
however there was little voter interest in the referendum 
agreed upon in advance by the government and its foes several 
small political groups opposed it 
experts said citizens were confused by the long often highly 
technical text of the amendments 
among the early voters was gen pinochet who cast his ballot at 
a downtown school 
pinochet 73 has ruled since a 1973 military coup overthrew 
elected president salvador allende a selfproclaimed marxist 
pinochet agreed to amend the constitution only after voters in 
october rejected a proposal by the military to extend his rule 
until 1997 
he then called presidential and congressional elections now 
scheduled for dec 14 the elected officials are to take office 
march 11 
the military has said the proposed constitutional changes aim at 
improving the constitution the opposition agreed but called 
the reforms insufficient and said they would seek more changes once 
the new congress convenes 
the constitution written by the military government was 
approved in a 1980 referendum that the opposition considers a fraud 
the proposed changes would ease restrictions on marxist 
activities which are banned under the present constitution the 
changes would effectively legalize marxism experts say 
other amendments would make future constitutional amendments 
easier shorten the presidential term from eight to four years and 
eliminate the presidents power to exile opponents and dissolve 
congress 
the opposition favored to win the congressional elections 
wants more changes including removal of a constitutional clause 
allowing pinochet and his peers in the navy air force and national 
police to remain as commanders until 1998 
pinochet already has said he plans to remain army commander 
after stepping down from the presidency

two tugboats pushed the damaged oil tanker 
exxon valdez into san diego bay early sunday for repairs of 
ruptures that caused the nations worst oil spill five months ago 
the highriding tanker which was ringed by eight coast guard 
and harbor patrol boats for security reasons crawled along at 3 
knots about 3 mph under a gray sky 
dozens of pleasure boats sailed along outside the security zone 
and ships with salvage and pollution response gear trailed behind 
boats carrying environmentalists also trailed watching for any 
signs of leakage 
the greenpeace organization deployed four sailboats and four 
inflatable boats that carried banners stating oil spills kill 
exxon rules and change the course steer toward sane energy 
hundreds of people watched from the shoreline as the tanker 
entered the bay and rounded north island sailing past waterfront 
hotels and navy warships harbor seals stared from resting spots 
atop buoys 
the longdelayed entry began after authorities said the tanker 
cleared its final inspection and gave exxon the goahead to bring 
it in 
the tanker which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
alaskas prince william sound when it went aground on march 24 was 
originally to enter under its own power but at the last moment 
tugboats were ordered to push it 
coast guard lt larry solberg and tom gillette an exxon 
shipping co official said the switch to tugboats was at the 
request of a state water quality control official who wanted the 
ship to be under greater control 
the sevenmile trip into the bay began about 6 am when the 
exxon valdez was under its own power stalled for a time for the 
tugs to move in and then resumed 
solberg said a final inspection by remotecontrolled underwater 
camera verified that the 987foot hull was free of dangling steel 
plates like those that had prevented the tankers entry to the 
harbor for weeks 
gillette said the plan was to enter with the rising tide which 
peaks at 930 am the ships transit through the bay to the 
national steel and shipbuilding co dock was expected to take 
several hours 
for the past three weeks the ship has stayed about 50 miles 
from san diego after initially being turned away as a pollution 
risk its original entry to the bay was halted when officials 
spotted a slick coming from the vessel

seven young women sunday became the first to take 
vows as catholic nuns in beijing since the communists took power in 
1949 
hundreds of people crowded beijings nantang cathedral to watch 
bishop fu tieshan induct the women as sisters of the 
statesponsored patriotic catholic church which has no ties with 
the vatican 
the seven bowed their heads covered by long black veils topped 
with circlets of plastic roses as fu admonished them to be true to 
their religious training which began in 1986 
after the 90minute service the new nuns posed for photographs 
with the bishop on the cathedral steps then left for their new 
life 
im very excited one said as she rushed to greet relatives 
and friends she said they would be assigned church work but that 
she did not know what it would be 
only about 3 million of chinas 12 billion people belong to the 
patriotic catholic church life has not been easy for them since 
1949 nor for the unknown number of catholics who still are loyal 
to the vatican and worship in illegal churches 
catholics and members of other religious groups repeatedly were 
singled out as politically suspect during leftist campaigns in the 
first decades of communist rule especially during the 196676 
cultural revolution when all churches were closed 
churches seminaries and convents began reopening over the past 
decade and training began for a new generation of priests and 
nuns two elderly nuns who had taken vows before 1949 were given 
the task of training beijings first new nuns 
one of those who took vows sunday sister yang lijun 24 said 
she and the others came from catholic families i wanted to be a 
nun since i was small in order to serve people she said 
churches in several other cities also began accepting candidates 
to become nuns in the mid1980s but the official xinhua news 
agency said in april that the group in beijing would take its vows 
first 
before being admitted for training as nuns or priests 
candidates are tested in political as well as religious knowledge 
and their classes include socialist theory

to the kabul government the united 
states holds the cards of war or peace when it meets the soviet 
union on monday to discuss afghanistan 
but much as the sovietbacked government of president najib 
would like the americans to play the peace card it sees the war 
card coming up us diplomats predict new military offensives and 
ussupplied rockets pound kabul every day 
the meeting in stockholm sweden will be the first superpower 
discussion focusing on the 10year afghan civil war since the last 
soviet troops left this central asian nation feb 15 
najib has confounded western diplomats who predicted moslem 
rebels would topple his sovietbacked government within days of the 
soviet pullout he remains in power while the guerrillas who call 
themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors appear to be 
squabbling among themselves 
so far the mujahedeen have failed to win control of a major 
city and have been driven back from the key city of jalalabad 45 
miles from the pakistan border 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani on saturday 
accused the mujahedeen of firing rockets at kabul for the past 
month to have something in their hand when the stockholm talks 
start the longrange rockets have killed more than 200 people 
virtually all civilians 
six rockets hit the capital sunday damaging kabul university 
destroying a factory and killing two women the government said 
we want the us to show us the peace card amani said 
but the signals have indicated that the united states in the 
stockholm talks will be stressing a military solution 
foreign minister abdul wakil said the most important thing the 
americans and soviets could do would be to encourage hostile 
groups to start a dialogue he also urged the superpowers to 
discuss a comprehensive peace settlement 
but peter tomsen a special us envoy to the mujahedeen 
appointed by president bush has predicted a major guerrilla 
offensive during the remaining fighting season which lasts until 
november snows he told a us congressional committee thursday 
the end is clear the resistance will prevail 
prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan which serves as the 
base for the major guerrilla groups also has predicted intensified 
war 
in this dusty capital surrounded by hills many diplomats and 
foreigners of all stripes have their doubts about a mujahedeen 
victory 
many are also concerned that a mujahedeencontrolled government 
likely led by islamic fundamentalists who have received the lions 
share of us military aid would turn afghanistan into another 
iran 
wakil said the afghan government has shown it can defend itself 
and predicted us pursuit of the military option will fail 
us officials have been quoted as saying the rebels will get 
new weapons to counter highly effective highaltitude bombing 
attacks by the afghan air force and to crater runways of afghan air 
bases 
the soviets want an end to hostilities but soviet ambassador 
yuli m vorontsov also first deputy foreign minister told a 
western correspondent here earlier this month that he was not 
optimistic 
the americans have been telling us privately what theyve been 
saying publicly about the arms supplies to the mujahedeen 
therefore we dont expect much from the beginning of the talks 
he said 
another sign of low expectations is the low level of the 
delegations 
the soviet delegation will be led by ambassadoratlarge nikolai 
i kozyrev a former diplomat in afghanistan who participated in 
negotiations on the unbrokered agreement that led to the 
departure of soviet troops 
the us delegation will be led by john kelly assistant 
secretary of state for near eastern and south asian affairs 
diplomatic sources speaking anonymously said the most 
important thing that has happened on the political front is the 
soviet recognition of the mujahedeen and their agreement to 
include the rebels in a coalition government 
the afghan government stresses that najib has offered free and 
fair elections under international supervision with all parties 
competing and has pledged to step down if the mujahedeen win

capitol hill is awash in proposals to tinker 
with who pays what for medicares new catastrophicillness 
insurance program as legislators try to appease outraged senior 
citizens who feel they were stuck with a good idea gone bad 
at issue is the medicare catastrophic coverage act enacted with 
great fanfare last july and touted as bringing peace of mind to 
millions of elderly americans who no longer need fear their life 
savings will be wiped out by staggering medical bills 
in a sunny rose garden ceremony thenpresident reagan and 
congressional architects of the plan hailed its innovative 
financing mechanism which requires those who benefit from the 
program to shoulder all of its costs 
a 15 percent surtax on federal income tax liabilities over 150 
affects about 40 percent of those 65 and older with the maximum 
payment capped at 800 in 1989 and rising to 1050 by 1993 most 
of the rest of the money comes from a flat supplemental premium on 
all but the poorest beneficiaries set at 4 a month in 1989 and 
rising to 1020 by 1993 
thats where the problems began and the peace of mind ended 
some older americans who lobbied hard for the benefits but 
didnt want to foot the bill alone have bombarded congress with 
complaints that their payments are too high and benefits too low 
they also argue that the program should not be mandatory because 
some people already have duplicate private coverage 
since almost all of us one day hope to benefit from the 
medicare program society has a basic responsibility to assist in 
its financing said lawrence smedley executive director of the 
national council of senior citizens 
spurred into action by the rebellion legislators have 
introduced a host of proposals to amend delay or repeal the 
program 
douglas besharov a resident scholar at the american enterprise 
institute said members of congress are trying to satisfy 
everyone or at least everyone who votes in large numbers 
everyone knew this program was going to be very expensive but 
they said dont worry its going to be selffinancing 
besharov said it turns out the deal may not be that binding 
in recent legislative action the house ways and means committee 
last week produced a plan that would halve the income tax 
surcharge increase the supplemental medicare premium paid by all 
but the poorest and limit the prescription drug benefit 
in addition senior citizens could opt out of the catastrophic 
program altogether if they also dropped part b of medicare which 
covers doctor bills and is financed primarily by general tax 
revenue 
the proposal squeezed through on a 1917 vote with proponents 
claiming it would ease the burden on elderly people in the middle 
class allow discontented seniors to drop out and preserve 
valuable benefits for the majority of older americans 
but the plan likely to be a focal point for further debate on 
the future of catastrophic coverage is quickly attracting critics 
among the very constituency it was designed to mollify 
we could never support this said frances humphreys 
executive director of the gray panthers we want to see a better 
financing plan by all means but we dont want to undermine the 
medicare program and we dont want to place any more of a burden on 
the poor 
ken hoagland of the national committee to preserve social 
security and medicare which has been leading the fight against the 
surtax said theyre still leaving the financing on senior 
citizens thats the problem 
sen john mccain rariz called it reprehensible to shift 
more of the costs to lowincome elderly and to portray the revised 
program as voluntary when few people can afford to give up part b 
of medicare a prerequisite for dropping catastrophic insurance 
on a 5840 procedural vote thursday the senate rejected a 
proposal by mccain that would delay implementation of the surtax 
and most of the benefits for a year giving congress time to 
rethink the whole package 
one of the few friendly reviews of the ways and means package 
came from the american association of retired persons which 
expressed concern about the added burden for lowincome 
beneficiaries but called the overall plan a positive step toward 
addressing some of the concerns which have been raised 
john rother aarps legislative director said the main 
alternative to the committees proposal appears to be outright 
repeal which would be far more regressive 
he said that while much of the opposition to the current program 
comes from highincome older americans who would pay the most part 
is from less affluent people who are under the mistaken impression 
they would have to pay the maximum surtax 
in fact less than 6 percent of elderly americans will pay the 
maximum amount 
this program is a great deal at a minimum for 75 percent of 
older people rother said they receive much more in benefits 
than they are asked to pay 
several other senior citizen groups have lined up behind 
legislation that would repeal the surtax retain all the 
catastrophic benefits and replace the lost revenues by extending 
the 33 percent income tax to all earnings of the nations 
highestincome taxpayers some of which now is taxed at 28 percent 
it offers real tax relief to older americans by closing a 
loophole for wealthy taxpayers said sen tom harkin diowa a 
sponsor of that proposal

a us court of appeals ruling that national 
security archive qualifies as a media organization enables the 
research group to receive discount rates for its numerous requests 
for government documents under the freedom of information act 
the decision friday stemmed from a lawsuit the national security 
archive a nonprofit group that compiles documents on national 
security and foreign policies brought against the defense 
department for its refusal to classify the organization as an 
educational institution or a representative of the news media 
either category would mean the group would not have to pay 
certain searchandreview charges for freedom of information 
act requests a potentially substantial benefit searchand review 
fees at the state department for example vary from 8 an hour to 
30 an hour 
circuit judge douglas h ginsburg writing the unanimous 
decision for the threemember panel said national security archive 
was entitled to media status because it planned to act in 
essence as a publisher for books such as its chronology of the 
irancontra affair and a 1000page index of documents about us

a harvard sociology professor wants to know why 
names suddenly rise in popularity why theres a slew of sarahs or 
a clutch of calvins in the same year 
stanley lieberson who has begun a scientific study of name 
fads says he first got interested in the phenomenon after choosing 
what he thought was an uncommon name rebecca for his eldest 
daughter in 1961 
in nursery school and kindergarten and through the years of 
grade school and onward there were always a bunch of beckies that 
she knew the professor said recently somehow there was 
something out there in the society that led parents without 
talking to each other to reach a conclusion 
in a search for possible social cues to parents lieberson began 
compiling health department lists of all babies born in california 
from 1905 to 1984 he also has data on upstate new york from 1973 
to 1985 wisconsin from 1979 to 1986 and various lists from other 
countries 
lieberson got the data by writing to various agencies and taking 
whatever records were available on computer tape 
now hell track the rise and fall of popular names he also will 
check them against the historical backdrop world war i or the 
great depression for example to see if parents tend to name 
their children after newsmakers 
if thats true for example there might have been a crop of 
boys named douglas when world war ii hero gen douglas macarthur 
loomed large on front pages 
early findings suggest that male and female forms of a name 
such as michael and michelle often become popular at the same time 
also lieberson said the rate of change appears to move more 
rapidly that it used to be 
parents tend to be more creative naming girls and give boys 
conservative monikers he said 
an exception is the name gary which was popular lieberson 
notes at a time when film star gary cooper swapped his real name 
frank for that of an indiana steel town 
in california from 1932 to 1952 gary increased from only 81 
instances to the ninth most popular boys name in the state but in 
1984 gary was absent from the list of the top 100 names 
as families become more looseknit parents who normally would 
name children after uncles and aunts may be looking to screen and 
sports celebrities for inspiration the professor theorizes 
for instance he says the recent popularity of the name ashley 
might have been inspired by the spread of laura ashley womens 
clothes stores or by ashley abbott a character on the soap 
opera the young and the restless

william lucas is making little headway in 
winning support from civil rights leaders and black americans in 
his quest for confirmation as the nations chief civil rights 
enforcer 
youre not likely to see a groundswell of black people coming 
out for mr lucas says althea simmons director and chief 
lobbyist of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
all but a smattering of civil rights leaders oppose lucas or 
have withdrawn early support as the senate judiciary committee 
nears a vote tuesday on the black former sheriff who switched 
parties in 1986 and became the republican candidate for governor of 
michigan 
the bush administration can probably count on seven of the eight 
votes needed for a favorable recommendation from the committee 
tuesday 
and sen howell heflin dala still undeclared appears able 
to send the 61yearold lucas to the senate floor with the panels 
blessing 
even if the committee rebuffs lucas the fight is likely to 
reach the floor in the long run and be settled by the full senate 
as the showdown nears lucas stands less at odds with the civil 
rights community than the posts last occupant william bradford 
reynolds but that is about the best that can be said of the 
relationship 
that represents a change because civil rights forces initially 
appeared divided over the nomination 
an early supporter rep john conyers dmich introduced lucas 
before the committee two weeks ago and then returned the next day 
to withdraw it saying he was dismayed by the nominees answers to 
questions from the panel 
the rev jesse jackson also withdrew his early support and is 
now among the lucas detractors 
both defections came after a judiciary hearing july 19 at which 
lucas said it was too early to assess the impact of recent supreme 
court decisions limiting the scope of laws to combat job bias and 
establish minority setasides in public works projects 
at the session he appeared uncertain about such matters as the 
difference between de jure segregation that is based in law and 
de facto segregation that exists without any legal basis 
naacp lobbyist simmons said her group was inundated by calls 
from black viewers around the country who had seen the hearing via 
the cablesatellite public affairs network cspan and were 
unimpressed by lucas 
civil rights leaders have narrowed their attack to one point 
they say he simply lacks the experience to do the job he has never 
tried a case filed a brief or handled an appeal 
its as if i had a medical degree but didnt practice medicine 
and were named to head a team of brain surgeons elaine jones of 
the naacp legal defense and educational fund told the committee 
they say attacking lucas on his lack of experience is far 
preferable to following the lead of judiciary committee democrats 
who have questions about the nominees passion for the cause of 
civil rights 
passion is a different thing to different people naacp 
lobbyist simmons said later it is the kind of thing that is not 
quantifiable how do you know he lacks passion but you do know 
that he has never tried a case 
lucas has received backing from a handful of civil rights 
activists around the country as well as black law enforcement 
officials 
among well known civil rights leaders though only the rev 
joseph lowery of the southern christian leadership conference has 
rallied to lucas 
this is not the place to throw down the gauntlet with mr 
bush lowery said it is not a lifetime appointment it is not 
the place were we have gotten our civil rights we have gotten our 
civil rights in the streets and in the supreme court and in the 
congress 
as far as im concerned lucas has a record of supporting 
affirmative action in his position as county executive and sheriff 
both for minors and women lowery said 
he shrugged off the complaints of other civil rights leaders 
that lucas was less than zealous about civil rights before the 
committee 
i didnt expect him to contradict the administrations 
position lowery said i didnt expect him to say unlike my 
boss mr bush and unlike my boss mr thornburgh i dont think 
hes crazy 
jackson however expressed concern about lucas remarks that it 
was too early to assess the impact of the decisions and his 
suggestion to the committee that the nation is headed in the right 
direction on civil rights 
today racial discrimination is defended not by dogs and hoses 
but by onerous burdens of proof severe statutes of limitations 
discovery restrictions and procedural trickery jackson said in a 
june 24 letter to biden

guatemalas young democracy is on a rough 
road as it heads toward a presidential campaign with strikes coup 
jitters businesses balking at higher taxes and rebel and vigilante 
groups on the prowl 
more than 50000 government employees have walked off the job 
demanding raises that president vinicio cerezo will not or dares 
not grant them 
the strike has trapped cerezo between the conservative 
privileged sectors and demands that have surged since democracy in 
1986 
his inauguration that year ended more than 30 years of 
militarydominated rule but the campaign to replace him at the end 
of his fiveyear term is expected to bring an increase in the 
violence that has been the curse of this ohiosized nation of 9 
million by law cerezo cannot run again 
affluent businessmen are reported doubling and tripling 
bodyguards in anticipation of kidnappings and other violence 
leading up to the election expected in the fall of next year 
dozens of bombs or bomb scares have hit the capital since july 
19 when the president went on national television to defy the 
strikers 
the president always packs a pistol 
after he puts on his tie he puts on his gun said 
presidential spokeswoman claudia arenas 
cerezo a man with a legendary social life whose government has 
been described kindly as improvised or less kindly as 
anarchic has been firm in his no to demands for raises 
he insists that by raising salaries the government which has 
one of the lowest tax bases in the hemisphere would unleash 
crippling inflation 
cerezo has not forgotten what happened when he supported a 
modest tax hike early in his term the business sector went on 
strike and rightists waged what defense minister hector gramajo 
later called a largescale procoup campaign 
coup attempts came in may 1988 and on may 9 of this year 
gramajo is credited with thwarting both attempts by holding the 
bulk of the armed forces in line 
the teachers began walking out in early june on july 13 
thousands of strikers blockaded congress during a ceremony honoring 
the 200th anniversary of the french revolution the diplomatic 
corps the cabinet and the congress were trapped for hours 
union leaders say teachers were promised a raise this year but 
havent received it despite rising prices two raises last year 
brought the starting salary to about 125 a month with top scale 
at 250 not bad by guatemalan standards the minimum wage is less 
than 60 a month 
private sector unions which earn less than the teachers 
demonstrated in sympathy with government workers july 26 
if there is irresponsibility if there is radicalization if 
there is polarization it could be risky said ms arenas 
the president insists the strike is pure politics and warned it 
could backfire by costing democratic political parties the 
chance to replace him when he steps down jan 14 1991 
you are being manipulated by the extreme right and the 
extreme left he told strikers in a nationwide television and radio 
address july 19 
as the broadcast began anonymous saboteurs bombed channel 7s 
transmission tower knocking the private station off the air 
with all its failings the cerezo administration can and does 
regard the survival of civil liberties outlined in the constitution 
as its major achievement that constitution which came into force 
in january 1986 gave public employees the right to strike 
before the strikers probably would have been shot said 
angel alfredo figueroa deputy attorney general for human rights 
in the fight for the nomination inside the majority christian 
democrats cerezo is backing party general secretary alfonso 
cabrera a close friend 
the other leading contender is party patriarch rene de leon who 
supporters hope can clean up the partys corruptiontarnished image 
twenty other political parties are registered 
the cerezo administration denies rumors cabrera is linked to 
narcotics traffic a major problem in guatemala us officials say 
they have no evidence cabrera is tied to drug trafficking but would 
not comment on other corruption charges 
civilian government has helped guatemala recover some of the 
respectability it lost in the bloodiest days of military repression 
and it has helped preserve a measure of civil liberty but it 
hasnt brought stability 
the military dominates the countryside where 70 percent of 
guatemalans live most under conditions that have changed little 
since the spanish conquest 
the 27yearold leftist insurgency continues in the remote 
mountains and jungles even though the rebel force has dwindled to 
fewer than 2000 fighters 
cerezo clearly feels insecure 
in june he retreated to the presidential farm for 10 days 
emerging to describe an assassination plot involving an improbable 
combination of cubans libyans and rightists 
high walls topped by barbed wire protect the homes of the 
wealthy few who control the vast majority of guatemalas resources 
socalled civil defense patrols dispense rough justice among 
the rural indian poor 
the mutual support group a human rights organization said 
there were about 800 political murders last year and amnesty 
internationals latest report says the army and police continue to 
run death squads

fashion was a highstyle spectacle last week as 
couture designers unveiled their extravagant clothes in opulent 
fabrics for winter of 198990 
the idea this season is sexy rather than power dressing 
most couturiers have backed off from the big padded shoulder 
after christian lacroix led the way two seasons ago but saint 
laurent and givenchy still believe that padding gives the right 
shape to suit jackets 
skirt lengths are irrelevant the many kneebaring skirts still 
look appealing for those with good legs especially when the skirts 
are given the tulipwrap treatment but some longer lengths looked 
fine too at influential houses like saint laurent and chanel 
there was a lot of retro around not least at the house of 
dior where the italian designer gianfranco ferre took a look at 
the first dior new look of 1947 and whipped up his own version 
although a newcomer to the paris shows ferre won the seasons 
top couture prize the golden thimble for his beautifully 
constructed clothes that had dashes of daring such as the sequined 
chevrontweed suits 
ferres dior evening wear showed huge organza bows at the neck 
the strapless and waspwaisted dresses with stiffened tulle 
underskirts plus ornamental bouquets of lilies of the valley 
some customers didnt buy all of ferres ideas a texan who has 
her own mannequin for fittings at dior said no way id buy those 
complicated clothes theyre too bulky for packing 
another italian gianni versace had the last word of the week 
placing his atelier couture models on headless mannequins in 
the jacquemartandre museum the party was attended by several 
celebrities including joan collins dressed in formfitting ruby 
satin marisa berenson in a beadembroidered versace tunic and 
isabelle huppert in an easyfitted beige silk dress 
christian lacroixs offhand mixing of fabrics in his short 
fitted suits and big accessories showed him in good form though 
some observers thought this was not his best collection 
saint laurents fans were glad to know that he kept his daytime 
wear strictly conservative with a sharplytailored silhouette 
long or bolero jackets with padded shoulders a few blousons and 
several flowing capes 
most of saint laurents evening wear had a true touch of magic 
his flowershaped short evening dresses in brocade lames were truly 
fabulous with their stiffened winglike collars and skirt wraps 
karl lagerfelds riding jacket for chanel stole the show 
the most memorable outfit in this curvaceous line was the 
decollete offtheshoulder outsized houndstoothcheck jacket worn 
with a wispy chiffon skirt 
chanel and virtually everyone else in paris showed fabulous lame 
damasked fabrics and brocades along with frothy dollops of 
chantilly lace and embroidered tulle satin and chiffon but rich 
velvets and taffetas and faille turned up as well 
jeanlouis scherrer interpreted evening wear as a dazzling magic 
carpet of shimmering fabrics in fitted short suits long gowns and 
tunics with pants for a thousand and one nights of rich revelry on 
the exotic road to india 
the hot new color to remember this fall will be chocolate 
dark milky or pinkish like cinnamon and it gets mixed in with 
shades like coral or aqua to lighten things up pearly grays at 
dior looked superb 
while it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and 
show most these couture collections and only a few women can 
afford the outfits costing well upwards of 10000 couture is 
considered useful 
the showy clothes serve as prototypes for luxury readytowear 
and they give a house and its designer an image and reputation to 
fuel sales of everything from accessories to makeup and perfume

when terry freiermuth began talking 
to his neighbors about the oily patches dotting the soil in the 
trailer park where he lives he couldnt find many who shared his 
worries 
but the 29yearold truck mechanic knew what he was talking 
about he grew up four miles away at love canal the neighborhood 
the government declared a national disaster area a decade ago 
because of chemical pollution 
people thought i was crazy freiermuth said but i know 
something about chemicals its the same damn thing all over 
again 
last week federal officials said industrial chemicals in the 
soil and groundwater under the forest glen mobile home park pose a 
significant environmental health threat to the 51 families living 
there they urged people to move away 
there is continuous danger to you and your children if you 
stay robert salkie of the environmental protection agency told 
a gathering of residents 
authorities think the ground on which the trailer park was built 
was once a chemical dump epa enforcement official david payne said 
several companies are under investigation including occidental 
chemical corp which a federal judge earlier this year ruled 
partly responsible for love canal contamination 
forest glen residents have reported health problems a lot like 
those at love canal allergies unexplained rashes headaches and 
fears as yet unproven of higherthannormal rates of cancer and 
other serious illness 
despite the doubts of his neighbors freiermuth who has lived 
in forest glen for nine years has been pestering federal officials 
about his fears since spring 1987 
he ordered his daughters ages 4 and 8 to play on the sidewalk 
to stay away from the grass and dirt he warned them against 
playing with the taffylike clumps of soil 
i figured theres nothing anybody can do for me after all 
these years freiermuth said but i hope its not too late for 
my kids 
he blames the chemicals for his youngest childs eczema a skin 
condition and he worries about kathy his wife who is pregnant 
the five contaminants found in forest glen are aniline 
phenothiazine benzothiazole mercaptobenzothiazole and 
polyaromatic hydrocarbons said david payne an epa enforcement 
official they apparently were byproducts from the manufacture of 
other chemicals he said adding that exposure to aniline causes 
cancer 
as with love canal epa officials suspect the contamination came 
from some of the many chemical companies attracted to the area by 
cheap hydroelectric power produced from the rushing waters of the 
niagara river 
that was the story at love canal where chemicals dumped in an 
abandoned waterway project in the 1940s and 1950s began seeping 
into cellars and backyards in the 1960s causing illness 
some 1030 familes evacuated a 10block area around love canal 
in 1978 and 1979 today the neighborhood is a ghost town except 
for the cleanup workers in rubber suits and the few residents who 
chose to remain 
even though freiermuth wasnt the only former love canal 
resident to move to forest glen he was one of the few who didnt 
quietly accept the situation part of it is that we came here to 
forget about love canal said freiermuth a small serious man 
with unruly blond hair and bushy sideburns but a lot of people 
figure that the chemicals are everywhere in this town 
federal officials have promised to help residents of forest 
glen the epas salkie said the neighborhood will become a model 
site to show how superfund can work 
the residents arent cooperating though most of them 
including the freiermuths have refused the governments offer to 
move to temporary homes while the site is placed on a priority list 
for federal cleanup 
we dont want to wait months in an apartment and then have to 
move again freiermuth said thats too disruptive why 
cant they just declare the site a federal emergency and buy us out 
like they did in love canal

the shiite moslem captors of us marine 
col william r higgins threatened sunday to hang him within 24 
hours if israel fails to free the proiranian fundamentalist cleric 
it abducted from lebanon 
this will be our first response to the stupid israeli 
aggression and the flagrant american support that proves us 
complicity in the crime said a statement issued by the 
underground organization of the oppressed on earth 
we shall carry out the death sentence handed down against 
proven spy higgins by hanging him at exactly 3 pm 8 am edt 
monday if sheik abdulkarim obeid and his two brethren have not 
been freed by then said the typewritten arabic statement 
it was delivered to a western news agency in beirut two days 
after helicopterborne israeli commandoes kidnapped obeid 33 and 
two colleagues from obeids home in a southern lebanese village and 
flew them to israel 
the statement was not accompanied by a picture of higgins the 
usual confirmation of authenticity but the statement appeared to 
have been typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlier 
statements previous statements had photographs of higgins or of 
his military identification card 
after the commando raid friday some speculated that israel 
would try to swap obeid and his colleagues for higgins or for three 
israeli soldiers believed to be held in lebanon since 1986 by 
obeids group or its affiliates 
obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god in south lebanon obeid has denied any 
links to the group 
hezbollah is widely believed to be the umbrella for shiite 
extremist factions including the oppressed on earth that are 
holding most of the 17 western hostages in lebanon nine of the 
hostages are americans 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini maintained that irans 1979 
islamic revolution was carried out for the mostazafin or oppressed 
on saturday israeli leaders dismissed criticism of the 
abduction and said obeid led a fanatical group that had 
launched terrorist attacks on israel 
on friday president bush said he could not condone the commando 
raid and that he did not know if it would help efforts to free 
higgins 
in tehran on sunday iranian interior minister ali akbar 
montashemi told reporters that islamic groups worldwide will 
retaliate against the united states and israel for the abduction of 
obeid 
the oppressed on earth group claimed responsibility for 
abducting higgins a decorated vietnam veteran near south 
lebanons port city of tyre on feb 17 1988 they charged he was a 
spy for the cia 
higgins 44 of danville ky served as head of a 76member 
observer group attached to the un peacekeeping force in south 
lebanon 
in a statement issued dec 12 1988 the oppressed on earth said 
it sentenced higgins to death after he had made full confessions 
about his espionage activities that statement said higgins had 
been handed to those responsible in the organization to 
execute this just verdict 
of the 17 western hostages the longest held is terry a 
anderson 41 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985

a judge has ruled against a doctor who was 
the first prosecuted under a federal law against patient 
dumping 
dr michael burditt who ordered an uninsured pregnant woman who 
was about to give birth to be transferred to another hospital 160 
miles away faces a 20000 fine donald p wilcox attorney for 
the texas medical association said saturday 
the patient dumping law which was part of the consolidated 
omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1986 forbids hospitals to 
turn away patients needing emergency care or who are in active 
labor 
burditt who was offduty at the time made the decision as 
chief of the obstetrical department at detar hospital in victoria 
the case arose when rosa rivera poor and about to give birth 
to her sixth child showed up at detar hospital late on the 
afternoon of dec 5 1986 
when a nurse called burditt and told him mrs riveras blood 
pressure was 210 over 130 he said she sounds like more than i 
can handle the blood pressure reading was higher than any he had 
seen in 12 years of delivering babies 
burditt ordered mrs rivera to be taken to john sealy hospital 
in galveston 160 miles away but the nurse and her supervisor were 
concerned about the federal law 
after some heated words between the doctor and the nurses mrs 
rivera left the hospital in an ambulance she gave birth to a 
healthy baby boy a halfhour later in the ambulance by the side of 
the road 
detar which nearly lost its eligibility for medicare funding 
paid a 5000 fine after an investigation by the dallas regional 
office of the department of health and human services 
burditt refused to pay a 25000 fine assessed against him and 
the texas and american medical associations took his side 
wilcox said the health and human services administrative law 
judge charles e stratton lowered the fine because of some 
mitigating factors 
since the incident burditt has improved the transfer network 
system and has helped set up an obstetric clinic to make prenatal 
care more accessible for indigent patients wilcox said 
a woman who identified herself as burditts wife said he would 
have no comment until monday she also said that he was no longer 
the chief of the hospitals obstetrical department but still 
practices there

for much of its 100 years californias 
orange county has represented a golden spot in a golden state 
cheap plentiful land that sprouted first farms then housing 
tracts it was a suburban sidekick to los angeles and a playland 
that mickey mouse called home 
but as the county of more than 22 million residents prepares to 
mark its centennial tuesday experts say it has already rocketed 
into the future as a metropolitan center where jobs not its 
nowcostly land are the lure and where urban woes are 
inescapable 
orange county has made the transition from being a suburb to 
being a center of commerce said mark baldassare professor of 
sociology at the university of california irvine in the next 
100 years i expect it will become more like a dense urban region 
jammed freeways and polluted air are the baggage carried by 
growth and wont be easily banished he said highpriced housing 
also will remain part of the landscape 
people will be coming here because its a land of economic 
opportunity not some kind of utopia baldassare said 
only recently have people realized that the dream of an 
uncrowded region with homes affordable to all has slipped away 
its within the last three years that surveys have found traffic 
consistently named the countys no 1 problem said tom fortune 
spokesman for the orange county transportation commission 
home prices in orange county have soared beyond the rest of 
costly california the median home price in june was 251674 
compared with 200445 statewide according to the california board 
of realtors that compares to a median price of 93200 nationwide 
its as if the entire coast of southern california is becoming 
one megamanhattan where only the wealthy can afford to live 
said baldassare 
but the high cost of living has not stopped corporations 
foreign and domestic from locating in orange county say 
baldassare and bob dunham president of newport economics group a 
newport beach califbased market research firm 
orange county known to many americans as the home of 
disneyland already is a major player in the pacific rim economy 
attracting big japanese manufacturers such as toshiba and 
panasonic said dunham 
baldassare agreed that foreign investment will grow and said 
the county will continue to attract the aerospace and other 
hightech corporations like those that have set up shop in such new 
developments as the irvine spectrum 
in irvine and other cities such as costa mesa glossy highrises 
stand in strange proximity to reminders of orange countys agrarian 
past patches of farmland that for now have escaped the bulldozer 
wes kirkpatrick 64 is one of the last cowboys still herding 
cattle on dwindling orange county ranchland 
kirkpatrick who came to california from larimer county colo 
nearly 20 years ago knows that the sliver of the old west in the 
canyon above the popular resort of laguna beach will inevitably 
vanish 
its a shame to see it go especially for someone like me 
raised on open country kirkpatrick said but to a lot of 
people it wont mean a thing 
like the grazing land the 61000 acres of fragrant orange 
trees strawberry fields and orchards scattered throughout the 
county seem like souvenirs of a past era in the 1930s 86 percent 
of the countys 500000plus acres was given over to farming and 
ranching 
it was agriculture that brought the countys first boom efforts 
at promoting farmland in the area surged in 1869 when the 
completion of the transcontinental railroad opened the west for 
expansion 
by 1889 voters decided to sever the region from los angeles 
county and form the county of orange the census the next year 
counted 13589 residents 
it was the postworld war ii search for affordable housing that 
produced the most massive wave of immigrants 
orange countys 1950 population was 220000 by 1960 it had 
swelled to 704000 residents an increase of 220 percent in a 
county that is roughly threequarters the size of rhode island 
the countys newcomers have maintained the primarily white 
middleclass profile that forecasters expect to persist along with 
a reputation for political conservatism 
once a bedroom community to los angeles orange county now finds 
itself an urban center calling on lessdeveloped inland counties 
such as riverside and san bernardino to provide housing

a congress characteristically lagging behind 
schedule enters its last week before summer recess ready to race 
through bills mapping how the government will spend nearly half its 
117 trillion budget next year 
the house has lofty plans hoping to complete the last seven of 
the 13 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 by friday 
the senate which by law can act on spending measures only after 
receiving them from the house might consider two appropriations 
bills late in the week it is likely to spend much of the rest of 
its time trying to complete work on the 295 billion defense 
authorization bill for next year 
by law congress was supposed to have completed action on all 
tax and deficitreduction legislation by june 15 and the house was 
to finish all 13 appropriations measures by june 30 the new fiscal 
year begins oct 1 
as usual those dates have come and gone without the work being 
done the law provides no consequences for missing the deadlines 
and lawmakers will begin their fourweek holiday on aug 5 with a 
large pile of budget work awaiting their return 
the house ways and means and the senate finance committees have 
yet to decide how to raise 53 billion in new tax receipts for 
next year called for in the congressional budget 
democrats are continuing to resist a capital gains tax cut that 
president bush is pressing and ways and means chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill has been talking with administration 
officials in a search of a compromise 
i dont know how long the discussion is going to continue 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said friday 
spending work also is going slowly the two chambers both have 
approved only three of the 13 appropriations bills and have yet to 
work out compromise versions of any of them that can be sent to 
bush for his signature 
the house will consider measures providing 16 billion for the 
legislative branch and 87 billion for military construction on 
monday and 58 billion for the commerce justice and state 
departments on tuesday 
on wednesday it debates legislation providing 500 million for 
the district of columbia and 155 billion for the departments of 
labor health and human services and education 
an 119 billion transportation bill will be considered 
thursday and the biggest of the spending bills a measure 
providing 305 billion for defense spending will be considered 
friday 
the senate could consider a measure for the treasury and postal 
service expected to be about 18 billion and a bill providing 
about 16 billion for congress own operations 
both chambers also plan to pass a bill that will permit the 
government to continue borrowing money so it can finance its 
operations the legal debt limit of 28 trillion should be 
surpassed sometime in august and congressional leaders hope to 
pass legislation that would provide enough money to permit 
borrowing through october 
such mustpass legislation often bogs down however because it 
attracts unrelated controversial amendments leaders are trying to 
secure agreements to avoid that 
the senate on monday resumes work on the defense authorization 
bill a measure that creates the programs that are then paid for by 
appropriations 
the house completed its version of the bill on thursday cutting 
b2 stealth bomber spending slashing the star wars program and 
taking other liberties with bushs defense priorities senate 
leaders are trying to fashion a measure more closely resembling 
white house preferences 
bushs nomination of william lucas as the nations chief civil 
rights enforcer comes up in the senate judiciary committee on 
tuesday 
many civil rights groups oppose lucas saying he lacks 
experience republicans say the 61yearold former wayne county 
mich sheriff who is black has learned his lessons the hard way 
in his climb from dishwasher to elected official 
in the spotlight is undeclared sen howell heflin dala whose 
vote could put lucas over the top even if the judiciary committee 
withholds its recommendation however the nomination is likely to 
end up under debate on the senate floor through an alternate route 
votes on a compromise savings and loan bailout bill also are 
planned next week the measure worked out by negotiators from the 
house and senate last week would cost 166 billion 
fireworks could still be touched off because the package ignores 
bushs proposal to remove 50 billion of the spending from the 
budget which would make the deficit appear smaller senate 
republicans could still block the plan

this citys reputation for corruption 
weakens its potential for economic and social growth most 
observers agree in the wake of the latest scandal 
last weeks arrest of mayor james usry six other city officials 
and several local business people was the fourth time out of six 
previous city administrations that the resorts leaders have been 
charged with corruption 
usry was elected five years ago as a reformist candidate after 
his predecessor was implicated in an influencepeddling scandal and 
lost a recall election 
once again residents and business owners are embarrassed 
albert a marks jr a longtime civic leader and former director 
of the miss america pageant remembers past attempts to reform the 
resorts government 
changes are thwarted by provincial attitudes he said 
atlantic city really needs help from the outside but everyone 
in atlantic city has a chip on their shoulder for the people who 
move to the suburbs marks said their attitude is we are 
alone to ourselves 
a regional government would be ideal but its probably not 
going to happen he said so its going to take a mayoral 
candidate whose qualifications are so beyond anybody who has ever 
run before and its going to take a very aggressive city manager 
who is really experienced in running a hundredmillion dollar 
business with billions of dollars in assets 
the citys 11 casinos mostly report to state gaming regulators 
but in matters of zoning and planning the gaming halls must endure 
a city system often overwhelmed by the mammoth projects usry has 
often been accused of being an incompetent administrator 
in a statement issued by the casino association of new jersey 
the casinos suggested changes in government must be made 
martin danzinger a former member of the state casino control 
commission said the citys deteriorated condition and its 
administrators reputations probably deter potential investors 
in 1976 when gambling was legalized gaming companies first 
rushed to atlantic city because it was new he said 
now investors notice that the city has failed to develop many 
aspects of the schools transportation and other social services 
danzinger said the expansion of the airport and the talk of a 
new convention center those are still being discussed after 10 
years 
that all negates interest by investors they say they have 
better places to throw their money he said 
atlantic city has a lot going for it geographically observers 
say a temperate seaside location just two hours away from the 
major metropolitan areas of new york and philadelphia 
a dying city injected with millions of dollars in new tax 
revenues such as atlantic city could be reborn danzinger said 
hartford pittsburgh and baltimore are just some examples of cities 
that have successfully put on a new face 
in those places cities and governments work hand in hand 
he said when i pass through atlantic city much of what i see 
looks exactly the way it did 10 years ago and thats largely the 
fault of city government 
but james hughes a professor of urban policy and planning at 
rutgers university said the city suffers because the casinos 
internalize operations local merchants are certainly hurt 
casino money bypassed the poor of the city said hughes 
coauthor of a 1983 book titled the atlantic city gamble a 
critical look at what legalized gambling did for the decaying 
resort 
usry and 13 others were charged thursday with bribery 
conspiracy influence peddling official misconduct and other 
counts resulting primarily from an attempt to gain control of a 
lucrative boardwalk electric cart business and an airport gift shop 
franchise 
the case now goes before a state grand jury in the meantime 
usry and the others can still hold office 
within hours after usrys arrest state takeover was on the 
minds of many legislation for an atlantic city super agency 
has been proposed before but never took off 
marks believes the state must take over atlantic city at least 
on an interim basis to eliminate what i perceive will develop into 
a chaotic situation it will psychologically calm things down

foreign ministers from the united states the 
soviet union and other countries opened an international conference 
sunday with a call for a comprehensive peace settlement in 
cambodia but the warring parties stuck to their entrenched 
positions 
cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk repeated his 
calls for a fourparty interim government that would include the 
widely detested khmer rouge 
his chief rival prime minister hun sen of the prohanoi 
cambodian government charged that khmer rouge participation would 
only open the door for them to return to power or provoke a civil 
war no one could limit or control 
the conference aimed at bringing an end to cambodias 
20yearold conflict opened with statements from leaders of 11 of 
the 20 delegations nearly all appealing for an end to the 
southeast asian nations trauma 
the occupation should end the violence should end the 
suffering should end said secretary of state james a baker iii 
we know the path to cambodian internal reconciliation is likely 
to be long and arduous but today we take the first steps 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze called for a 
ceasefire in cambodia even before all the vietnamese troops have 
left and for an international body to monitor the withdrawal 
he also called for practical measures to stop outside military 
assistance to all the warring groups 
foreign minister roland dumas of france the cohost of the 
conference along with indonesia opened the meeting declaring it 
was now possible and urgent to bring an end to one of the most 
murderous unjust conflicts in history 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 ending a khmer rouge rule 
during which hundreds of thousands of people died in execution 
chambers and slave labor camps vietnam installed another communist 
government in phnom penh 
as the conference began two japanese buddhist monks chanted 
outside the turnofthecentury international conference hall a 
block from the arc de triomphe they banged drums and offered 
prayers for the meetings success 
hun sen announced that only 26000 vietnamese troops remained in 
his country and reiterated earlier promises that all would be out 
by the end of september 
vietnams current troop strength in cambodia has been estimated 
by western analysts at 60000 to 70000 
sihanouk renewed his charges that vietnamese soldiers and 
colonialists would in stay in cambodia and he said the risk of his 
country remaining a vietnamese protectorate was greater than the 
threat from the khmer rouge 
the paris conference is the first among all involved parties 
which include sihanouks threeparty guerrilla coalition and its 
chief arms supplier china as well as the hun sen government 
vietnam and its main backer moscow 
echoing one of the points of general agreement among the 
speakers baker said the khmer rouge should play no role in 
cambodias future 
however he said washington was willing to support sihanouks 
inclusion of the khmer rouge one of the parties of his loose 
coalition in an interim arrangement he further qualified the 
position by saying the actual khmer rouge leaders responsible for 
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of cambodians could never be 
allowed to return to power 
the strength of our support for any cambodian government 
however will directly and inversely depend on the extent of khmer 
rouge participation if any in that government baker said 
baker said an international monitoring body under un auspices 
should be set up to monitor the withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
ensure interim stability and ensure free and fair general elections 
no new proposals to end the conflict were presented by the 11 
delegates who spoke on the opening day of the conference scheduled 
to address the monthlong conference monday were the representatives 
of china vietnam japan and the khmer rouge 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar suggested a 
factfinding mission travel to cambodia as soon as possible to lay 
the groundwork for a monitoring body 
cambodian guerrillas said vietnamese troops backed by artillery 
fire have been trying to retake khmer rouge guerrilla positions in 
western cambodia near the thai border 
a report heard sunday in bangkok from guerrilla radio said the 
attacks showed vietnam was not withdrawing even an inch from the 
border and did not want a peace settlement 
the radio reported attacks recently on three areas of battambang 
province bordering thailands prachinburi and chantaburi provinces 
south sisophon sisophonphnum malai and pailin 
according to thai military officers provietnamese forces have 
intensified shelling of guerrilla positions in the past week 
officials said the attacks could be intended as a show of 
strength during the paris talks

buses 
several dozen executions are known to have taken place since the 
studentled protests were crushed in beijing june 34 the 
authorities previously directly linked only 12 people to the 
protests many chinese believe the number is far higher 
the official media have reported more than 2060 arrests 
nationwide in connection with the protests according to associated 
press count in recent weeks however the government has stopped 
publicizing arrests and executions apparently in part ot avoid 
international criticism 
thousands of arrests are believed to be taking place secretly 
nationwide

chinese shanxi province denounced the beijing government at a rally 
and told the audience he lied at the official ideological education

all the official speeches were rubbish its so hypocritical 
said the worker who identified himself as li

at a downtown park to condemn chinese authorities for the 
suppression of prodemocracy demonstrators 
li who arrived in early july is scheduled to return to china 
in september when his visitors permit expires he came alone 
leaving his wife and two children in taiyuan provincial capital of 
shanxi about 250 miles southwest of beijing

bothered if he had to go back he requested a television crew not 
film his face

actor rob lowe will have some leeway in deciding 
terms of 20 hours of community service he agreed to perform to 
avoid criminal prosecution a prosecutor said sunday 
district attorney lewis r slaton had been investigating whether 
to charge lowe in the videotaping of jan parsons then 16 in a sex 
scene with a woman in an atlanta hotel room when lowe was attending 
the 1988 democratic national convention 
lowe 25 is one of 2600 people to participate in georgias 
pretrial intervention program which slaton called an alternative 
to prosecution for young nonviolent first offenders 
he fit the description of the program and the fact that he 
happened to be famous didnt work against him slaton said if 
he completes the program in the two years time and there are no 
other problems hes cleared from prosecution 
lowe and his father met with slaton on friday almost a year 
after the alleged incident 
he remains the subject of a civil suit brought by miss parsons 
mother lena arlene wilson who claims lowe seduced her daughter 
lowes atlanta attorney edgar a neely iii said his clients 
agreement is not an admission of guilt in the civil suit 
this case is not the kind that youd take to a grand jury 
anyway he said adding that lowe made an error in judgment 
not a criminal thing 
initial reports on the agreement referred to two years of 
community service and omitted the 20hour requirment 
slaton said exact terms of the program will be worked out in the 
next few weeks but that lowe basically is expected to visit about 
20 schools in the los angeles area over the next two years to make 
speeches on topics such as drugs and the law 
he also has expressed some interest in some schools outside of 
los angeles so thats one of the details theyll work out 
slaton said then anytime he does something makes a speech for 
an hour or something it will be tabulated here until hes done 
slaton said lowe is to be supervised by the georgia department 
of labor which runs the program 
the criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor which 
lowe might have faced carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in 
prison and a 100000 fine slaton said 
lowe stared in such movies as about last night st 
elmos fire and oxford blues

the united states and vietnam on sunday 
announced an agreement for former political prisoners and their 
relatives to be resettled in the united states with the first 
group of 3000 expected to leave this year 
a joint statement said the two sides hoped to begin by october 
a program for the resettlement in the united states of released 
reeducation center detainees and their close family members who 
wish to emigrate to the united states 
the communists toppled the usbacked south vietnam government 
in april 1975 and hundreds of thousands of people were put into 
the camps of manual labor and political study because of their ties 
with the old regime vietnam has said all but about 120 have been 
freed 
the us government has sought a formal program for their 
resettlement since 1982 but political bickering and other problems 
barred progress 
the agreement was reached in vietnams capital hanoi in talks 
last week between teams led by vu khoan vietnamese assistant 
foreign minister and robert l funseth us senior deputy 
assistant secretary of state 
funseth said the agreement starts healing the last big wound 
remaining from the war which is that these people who were clearly 
associated with the united states have not been allowed to leave 
vietnam and be united with their relatives in the united states 
funseth speaking to reports in bangkok on sunday said he also 
requested that vietnam free the remaining prisoners as soon as 
possible 
in the joint statement the us government said it will not 
encourage resettled prisoners to engage in activities hostile to 
vietnam and said it opposed such activities 
vietnam says exiles have engaged in anticommunist agitation and 
even organized armed forays into vietnam to try to overthrow the 
government 
the statement said the program would be in addition to existing 
programs for resettling amerasians children of american fathers 
and vietnamese mothers and of other refugees and migrants under 
the orderly departure program 
it said the two sides expressed hope that the first group of 
3000 persons for resettlement in the united states under this 
agreement will depart vietnam before the end of the year after 
processing is completed 
the statement did not say how many people in all may eventually 
leave vietnam under the program 
a us source in bangkok speaking anonymously said washington 
estimates about 100000 vietnamese sent to reeducation camps are 
among the 600000 who have applied to emigrate to the united states 
the vietnamese estimate former inmates and their families number 
550000 he said 
vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach said in june that 
94000 reeducation prisoners had been freed in the past decade 
in august 1988 hanoi suspended talks on resettlement to protest 
us refusal to consider diplomatic ties until vietnam ends its 
occupation of cambodia hanoi agreed to resume talks during last 
months international conference on indochinese refugees held in 
geneva 
cooperation on humanitarian issues is expected to improve 
further after vietnam withdraws from cambodia it has promised to 
do so by the end of september

in the name of god the merciful the compassionate 
o sons of our islamic nation 
o free men and oppressed of the world 
it appears that the zionist government is persisting in its 
terrorist and aggressive policy against islam and the moslems a 
screaming proof of this is the latest aggression carried out by the 
army of the israeli enemy in which struggler sheik abdul karim 
obeid was abducted along with two brethren another son of the town 
of jibchit also was killed 
this big aggressive act will not deter us from continuing the 
struggle and resistance to snip out the cancer planted in our 
blessed land and chop off the hand of the arrogants headed by the 
great satan america 
if the sons of zion and their american arrogant backers think 
that such acts will force us to compromise or capitulate they are 
wrong and will always be wrong 
we are the true islamic nation of mohammed in whose flesh and 
blood martyrdom has been mixed since alhusseins ashoura we are 
the nation of glorious jihad holy war in which islam has bred 
the spirit of confidence and insubordination to no one but almight 
god 
today after this cowardly operation we declare that american 
spy col higgins link to the us central intelligence agency has 
been proven beyond a shred of doubt he coordinated conspiratorial 
efforts by the cia and the zionist enemy to hit at moslem forces 
and their struggle against israel 
we have announced that in a previous statement and emphasized 
that he has been admitted into the circle of serious danger after 
the death sentence that had been handed down against him 
therefore we reiterate today that we shall carry out by hanging 
the death sentence handed down against proven spy higgins at 
exactly 3 pm 8 am edt monday if sheik abdul karim obeid and 
his two brethren have not been freed by then 
this will be our first response to the stupid israeli aggression 
and the flagrant american support that proves us complicity in 
the crime procrastination will be futile and so will be repentance

a newspaper on sunday cautioned iranians not 
to expect miracles from the new government of hashemi rafsanjani 
who was elected president in a landslide 
final results show that rafsanjani who has been the parliament 
speaker captured 945 percent of the presidential vote friday 
just hours after the final results were announced the official 
iranian media reported that soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze would arrive monday on an official visit 
irans relations with the west are strained and rafsanjani has 
been looking to the soviet union to help rebuild industries that 
were battered in irans eightyear war with iraq 
constitutional amendments also approved friday make the 
presidency the most powerful post in the government it should give 
rafsanjani more control over the government than any previous 
president in the 10year history of the islamic republic 
the radical jomhuri islami newspaper cautioned sunday that 
people shouldnt expect miracles to end soaring inflation high 
prices and widespread inflation 
it would be wrong if some people were hoping that every 
problem would be solved quickly once the new government takes 
charge the newspaper said in an editorial 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi told a news conference 
sunday that the revamped constitution which scraps the post of 
prime minister was approved by 97 percent of those casting ballots 
the amendments are designed to eliminate rival power blocs that 
have paralyzed decisionmaking for years and delayed economic and 
social reforms 
despite reports of a low turnout mohtashemi said a record 70 
percent of the countrys eligible 24 million voters took part 
he said iranian security forces had blocked attempts to smuggle 
in weapons and ammunition and arrested elements cooperating with 
foreign agents but gave no further details 
it was not immediately clear when rafsanjani a middleranking 
cleric who emerged as irans most powerful politician after the 
death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on june 3 would take over 
president ali khamenei who succeeded khomeini as irans supreme 
leader is due to step down as president when his second fouryear 
term ends in october 
but he is expected to hand over power earlier so that rafsanjani 
can start tackling the countrys economic problems 
rafsanjani hopes to revitalize the sluggish iranian economy by 
encouraging private investment and adopting a more laissezfaire 
approach 
he is also expected to gradually rebuild relations with western 
countries which were severely strained by khomeinis decree that 
british author salman rushdie should be killed for allegedly 
blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic verses 
mohtashemi said the rushdie affair is not an impediment on our 
side to better relations with the west but said the religious 
decree still stands 
if the western world wants to have relations with the islamic 
world it must deliver him to the islamic world so the decree can 
be executed otherwise this will remain a wound in the relations 
between the two worlds he said

the rev jesse jackson on sunday claimed 
president bush has offered no substance to back up his professed 
commitment to civil rights 
jackson interviewed on nbctvs meet the press faulted 
bush for supporting recent supreme court rulings opposed by civil 
rights leaders for failing to strengthen the civil rights 
commission and for lacking a comprehensive plan to fight drugs 
reagan laid the tracks to set us back jackson said so 
far bush has put grease on those tracks and not any brakes 
he credited bush for directing less antagonism toward civil 
rights but added so far no substance 
its too early to grade him but there are some bad papers 
jackson said so far we are disappointed 
jackson said bushs nomination of a black lawyer republican 
william lucas to serve as the justice departments chief civil 
rights advocate was a sinister play on race 
jackson said lucas was unqualified for the position because he 
lacks trial experience but that there are other republican 
minorities who are suited to the job 
we need a credible civil rights lawyer who we feel will argue 
our case behind closed doors jackson said how can you expect 
someone to perform the ultimate surgery who has never faced a 
patient mr lucas would be expected to preside over 200 civil 
rights lawyers and he has never tried a case 
jackson who is moving his legal residence to washington again 
sidestepped questions about whether he would run for mayor of the 
district of columbia in 1990 
i have no plans to run for the mayor of dc jackson said 
there is no race in dc this year but i am a little closer to 
the white house 
asked about his aspirations for the presidency in 1992 jackson 
said its too early to make that decision but based upon last 
years efforts i am encouraged

to the involvement of turkish fundamentalists 
it said however that german officials who questioned airport 
workers after the bombing have refused to either support or 
dismiss the observers account 
the newspaper said five turks involved in the plot worked or 
posed as airport workers two in maintenance one in catering and 
two in unspecified areas 
one described as a young engineer planted the bomb in a suitcase 
inside a cargo container said the observer he left germany for 
beirut shortly after the bombing it said without identifying the 
man 
in two articles the newspaper said the plot grew out of 
meetings between the pflpgc iranian diplomats and revolutionary 
guards and a bewildering array of arab extremists 
in a series of meetings in beirut and iran beginning july 12 
1988 the extremists conceived plans for a terrorist attack the 
paper said 
it noted that nine days earlier the united states missile 
cruiser uss vincennes had mistakenly shot down an iranian passenger 
jet killing all 290 aboard 
the newspaper said pflpgc leader ahmed jibril spoke at a dec

railroad workers have called a strike on the 
moscowleningrad line that could paralyze the northwestern soviet 
union the communist party daily pravda said sunday 
the report of railroad workers discontent over wages and work 
conditions came after hundreds of thousands of coal miners in the 
ukraine and siberia walked off their jobs earlier this month over 
poor living and working conditions 
railroad director a zaitsev spoke of the strike calls in a 
briefing for soviet journalists pravda said the report did not 
say when the strike might occur 
pravda said a railroad strike would be an extraordinarily 
dangerous action leading to a very real catastrophe for the 
northwest economic region 
another walkout following the coal miners strike would add to 
the economic chaos and could make strikes more attractive to other 
disgruntled soviet workers 
the pravda article said transportation strikes were prohibited 
in many countries intimating that officials would not tolerate a 
walkout 
president mikhail s gorbachev sided with the striking coal 
miners against bureaucrats who he said were holding back reforms 
and he promised broad improvements in their lives most returned to 
work 
in a speech july 19 on the coal miners strike gorbachev said 
there had been calls for a railroad engineers strike beginning 
aug 1 and warned against it such a strike would damage efforts to 
reform the economy and improve conditions for everyone gorbachev 
said 
pravda quoting the moscowleningrad railroads newspaper said 
a strike would shut down factories in the northeast soviet union 
and cause chaos in our everyday lives 
it said railroad workers complained they were not given adequate 
time to eat during their shifts it said they claimed unjust wage 
discrepancies among workers at stations along the 375mile route 
pravda questioned why independent activists were making 
demands rather than the unions that represent the railroad workers 
soviet unions long have done little but follow official policy 
and workers have begun voicing their demands outside the official 
union structure

us sen bill bradley told the nations 
governors sunday that dramatic changes in the soviet union could 
mean future economic benefits for the united states but little 
immediate opportunity for individual states 
bradley dnj who recently traveled throughout the soviet 
union said the united states should be rational capitalists not 
romantic capitalists in dealing with the soviets 
he cautioned against extending credit to the soviets because 
i dont want to help the soviets avoid the choice between guns 
and butter 
efforts by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to improve the 
economy will require reduced defense spending and therefore offer 
the potential of arms agreements bradley said but he said the 
soviet union will have little money to spend on nonmilitary deals 
with the united states 
it seems to me theres going to be very little way to make 
very much money in the soviet union for a long time to come he 
said 
the governors meeting at the fourday bipartisan national 
governors association have been focusing on ways to improve us 
economic competitiveness and how states can enhance business 
arrangements with other countries president bush plans to address 
the group on monday 
maine gov john mckernan a republican asked bradley how much 
potential the soviet changes could offer state businesses 
dont expect your maine businessmen to be making billions in 
the soviet union unless theyre willing to treat it as the 
ultimate wildcat bradley said 
also at the conference was federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan who told the governors that the world economys 
increasing reliance on technology will mean states will have to 
devote more attention to education 
the major capital of the next century is going to be minds 
that produce ideas greenspan told a gathering of associations 
executive committee 
more and higher quality education must be presumed to be 
crucial in americas competition with our industrial partners for 
economic world leadership greenspan said 
outside the meeting about 50 abortionrights demonstrators held 
a brief rally to urge governors not to back efforts to restrict 
access to abortions 
the meeting is the governors first since the supreme court gave 
states greater leeway in regulating abortion governors steered 
clear of the issue in their formal meetings but abortion and the 
political impact of the decision was being discussed in the halls 
delaware gov michael castle a republican said abortion will 
be a dominant issue in the states

the shiite moslem captors of a us 
marine held hostage in lebanon said they would hang him monday 
unless israel released a shiite moslem clergyman kidnapped by 
israeli commandos 
the organization of the oppressed on earth threatened to kill 
lt col william r higgins at exactly 3 pm monday or 8 am 
edt if sheik abdul karim obeid has not been freed by then 
obeid is alleged to be the spiritual leader of the shiite moslem 
hezbollah militia in south lebanon and to have played a role in 
higgins abduction 
in washington the white house said the kidnappers will be held 
fully responsible for the safety of higgins and other american 
hostages 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called the threat 
an affront to the entire civilized community she said 
secretary of state james baker iii discussed higgins situation 
earlier sunday at a paris meeting with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
israeli officials refused comment on the groups threat 
this will be our first response to the stupid israeli 
aggression and the flagrant american support that proves us 
complicity in the crime the organization of the oppressed on 
earth said in a statement delivered sunday to a western news agency 
in beirut it called higgins 44 a proven spy 
in a statement issued dec 12 1988 the organization said it 
had sentenced higgins to death and said he made full confessions 
about his espionage activities 
higgins of danville ky was serving as head of an observer 
group attached to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when 
he was seized feb 17 1988 his captors accused him of spying for 
the cia 
sundays typewritten arabic statement was not accompanied by a 
picture of higgins the usual sign of authenticity but it appeared 
typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlier statements 
it said obeids abduction will not deter us from continuing 
the struggle and resistance to snip out the cancer planted in our 
blessed land and chop off the hand of the arrogants headed by the 
great satan america 
in iran the interior minister said islamic groups worldwide 
will retaliate against israel and the united states for the 
abduction of obeid israeli troops were put on alert 
israeli commandos armed with silencerequipped pistols stole 
into the lebanese village of jibchit early friday kidnapped obeid 
from his apartment and flew him to israel in a helicopter his 
cousin ahmed obeid and a friend majid fahs also were seized 
lebanese police said 
israel described ahmed obeid and majid fahs as assistants of 
obeid 
obeid has denied involvement in higgins abduction or in 
hezbollah believed to be the umbrella for shiite moslem factions 
holding most of the 17 foreigners held hostage in lebanon 
according to israeli sources who demanded anonymity obeid was 
involved in the operation to kidnap higgins and held the marine for 
a time in his home i believe he can tell us one source said 
when asked if obeid was expected to provide information on higgins 
it is very natural that the islamic clergy and militant 
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests 
of israel and the united states iranian interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi told a news conference sunday in tehran they 
will not allow them to live comfortably 
he named hezbollah as one of the moslem groups that should 
retaliate 
asked about the fate of hostages in lebanon mohtashemi said 
the issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us 
an iranian newspaper said obeids abduction jeopardized moves to 
free the hostages who include nine americans the hostage held 
longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was abducted march 16 1985 
the zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarian 
efforts to release hostages in lebanon the tehran times said in 
an editorial sunday 
the englishlanguage daily said such actions can upset the 
psychological atmosphere needed for ending their ordeal 
israeli officials have accused obeid of instigating attacks on 
israel and hinted that his kidnapping may have been arranged to 
prepare for a possible prisoner swap but hezbollah leaders have 
ruled out a swap 
three israeli servicemen are believed held by hezbollah 
soldiers rahamim alsheikh and yossi fink captured feb 17 1986 
when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in south lebanon and air 
force navigator ron arad seized oct 16 1986 when his plane 
crashed near the lebanese city of sidon 
the sunday times in london said talks to arrange the soldiers 
release may now resume because israel has a bargaining chip in 
obeid it said israel and iran had conducted talks about trading 
hostages including a recent meeting in london last month 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman allon liel said he did not 
know of any talks 
lebanons acting prime minister salim hoss said he has 
requested un and red cross help in efforts to secure obeids 
release

a federal agency judge says a victoria texas 
obstetrician let his fear of a malpractice lawsuit cloud his 
judgment when the doctor ordered a poor sick woman who was about 
to give birth transferred to another hospital 160 miles away 
dr michael l burditt the first physician prosecuted for 
violating a 1986 federal law against patient dumping is expected 
to fight the 20000 civil penalty imposed upon him by the 
department of health and human services 
the agency on sunday released the 44page ruling by 
administrative law judge charles e stratton upholding the hhs 
inspector generals sanctions against burditt but reducing the 
fine from 25000 to 20000 
the texas medical association the state branch of the american 
medical association has previously agreed to pay burditts legal 
costs and any fine stemming from his controversial handling of the 
case of rosa rivera 
mrs rivera showed up at the emergency room of detar hospital in 
victoria on dec 5 1986 to have her sixth child without seeing a 
doctor during the pregnancy and with blood pressure of 210 over 160 
high enough to cause stroke and death 
burditt then chief of the hospitals obstetrical department 
was summoned by phone to treat the indigent woman because he was 
next on a list to handle emergency obstetrical calls he told a 
nurse he did not want to take care of this lady and said she 
should be transferred to a better equipped hospital in galveston 
burditt drove in examined her and ordered the transfer to 
proceed despite the objections of nurses worried that it would 
violate the thennew law against patient dumping that law 
specifies that hospitals must treat patients in medical emergencies 
or in active labor 
burditt said he would choose his patients until detar a private 
hospital paid his malpractice premiums but he also stayed to 
deliver a baby of another poor uninsured women who was seven 
months pregnant and bleeding 
mrs rivera in tears was eventually transferred and bore a 
healthy 6pound baby boy in the ambulance parked on the roadside 40 
miles east of victoria she and the baby were returned to detar 
where another doctor treated them 
stratton wrote that the 1986 law was enacted to close the door 
on the shameful practice of denying emergency hospital care to 
many persons in dire need he cited an estimate at a 
congressional hearing that as many as 200000 persons were denied 
emergency hospital care each year primarily for economic reasons 
it is a tragedy that dr burditt a wellrespected physician 
a decent personable man with loyal friends and patients let his 
parochial interests and personal feelings interfere with his 
exercise of sound professional medical judgment stratton said 
burditt testified in january that he had sought to avoid 
highrisk patients in part because of his need to keep regular 
hours as the sole parent of a teenage daughter 
while he never meant to harm mrs rivera he further 
compounded his initial recklessness in ordering her transfer by 
allowing his anger at having his authority challenged by nurses 
to close his mind to the merit of cancelling the transfer 
stratton said 
his unyielding attitude did not prompt him to investigate 
the nurses concerns treat mrs rivera before she was transferred 
or treat mrs rivera when she was returned to detar hospital 
stratton said in this instance although dr burditt was not 
venal he lost sight of his oath as a physician 
the benefits of the transfer depended on two fragile 
individuals surviving a 160170 mile ride bereft of treatment 
said stratton he acted in reckless disregard and deliberate 
ignorance of the law 
stratton said there were both aggravating and mitigating 
circumstances in the case among the former he said were 
burditts failure to consult another doctor in the hospital and his 
refusal to treat her after she had the baby 
the mitigating factors included mrs riveras own failure to get 
prenatal care and the hospitals lack of medical records in her 
case another mitigating factor stratton said was burditts 
subsequent role in creating a new prenatal clinic for poor women in 
victoria and helping improve transfer procedures for sick patients 
in the small city between houston and corpus christi 
detar which nearly lost its eligibility for medicare funding 
paid a 5000 fine after an investigation by the dallas regional 
office of the department of health and human services 
donald p wilcox attorney for the texas medical association on 
saturday called strattons ruling disturbing 
we thought what he did was defensible and accepted practice 
wilcox said

bloodletting in an aug 15 runoff vote 
her main obsctale to winning the 50 percentplusone margin 
needed to clinch the 18th district nomination is the candidacy of

favored in recent polls rosario kennedy 
the special election to fill the peppers seat is to be held 
aug 29 pepper who died may 30 at age 88 filled the seat since

a wellfunded republican leading a united party 
republicans hold an unprecedented 108 lead in the states

democrats would unite after the expected runoff 
ms kennedy who resigned her miami city commission seat to run 
is the unquestioned frontrunner among the democrats she has the

counter challenges to her ethics and attacks on her personal life 
and hispanic roots 
her campaign mailings highlighted richmans defense of arms 
dealer sarkis soghanalian richman who used soghanalians plane to 
fly to tallahassee to meet the campaign qualifying deadline 
defended the arms dealer as a patriot

the federal bureau of land management has 
allowed commercial and recreational interests to take priority over 
the protection of wildlife in the california desert government 
auditors said in a report released sunday 
the general accounting office said that while there has been a 
shortage of money to develop wildlife protection plans even if 
more funds were available blm has not demonstrated the 
willingness to take actions necessary to protect wildlife 
interests 
for example the gao said the bureau has permitted motorcycle 
races and established free play areas for offhighway vehicles 
in areas important to the desert tortoise has allowed livestock 
grazing that is harmful to some species and has placed 
insufficient restrictions on mining operations 
blm has frequently allowed the needs of competing interests 
such as recreation and commercial use to take precedence over 
wildlife interests when conflicts arise the gao said 
it said data on the desert tortoise an important gauge for the 
health of habitat for other species in the desert indicate that 
the effects are not favorable 
desert tortoise numbers have decreased dramatically in recent 
years and according to tortoise experts the species may now be 
sliding irreversibly toward extinction the gao said 
the california desert conservation area was established by the 
federal government in 1976 to protect a 25millionacre area that 
represents onefourth of californias total acreage 
while blm considered wildlife needs during its overall land 
use planning process for the california desert the wildlife 
protection objectives envisioned in the overall land use plan have 
not been achieved the gao study said 
the gao report was released by sen alan cranston dcalif who 
said the desert is not being adequately protected against callous 
usage and the inroads of development

french agents filmed felix bloch the us diplomat 
under investigation for spying passing a briefcase to a kgb 
official involved in circumventing a ban on selling high technology 
to the soviets french newspapers reported 
the weekend edition of liberation reported that agents of the 
french counterespionage agency shot the footage in early 1989 
the story which cited a very good source in paris said the 
film did not show the contents of the briefcase 
bloch 54 served at the us embassy in vienna from 1980 to 
1987 and was the secondhighest ranking diplomat there in his last 
four years 
he returned to washington in 1987 and became director of the 
state departments office of european regional politicaleconomic 
affairs he is considered a specialist on the european community 
bloch was placed on administrative leave from the state 
department on june 22 while investigators looked into allegations 
that he spied for the soviet union 
the weekly journal du dimanche citing no sources reported 
sunday that the man filmed with bloch was a member of the soviet 
diplomatic mission to unesco but also a spy for the new kgb 
service known as agency 4 the agency is charged with stealing 
sensitive techonology secrets the newspaper said 
several times the american was in brussels and paris an 
economi expert he prepared economic meetings of nato but also 
those of cocom the parisbased organization responsible for 
authorizing technology transfers to the east the newspaper said 
from here the question posed by western counterespionage 
services was felix bloch part of a network destined to penetrate 
cocom 
the 17member coordinating committee on multilateral export 
controls comprises japan australia and all members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization except iceland as eastwest relations 
have improved the soviet union and some european countries 
including west germany have pressed for the relaxation of 
restraints 
the sale of high technology to the east was among the topics 
discussed during meetings in july between president francois 
mitterrand and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
a fiveweek investigation into blochs activities by austrian 
security authorities turned up no independent evidence that bloch 
engaged in espionage or met with suspected kgb contacts according 
to robert danzinger director general for austrian public security 
on friday soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arriving 
in paris for an international conference on cambodia said his 
country and bloch had no link that could raise the slightest 
suspicion 
according to the journal du dimanche and liberation blochs 
position at the embassy gave him access to sensitive information 
including the identity of central intelligence agency operatives in 
vienna and other eastern european countries 
he also had access to secret codes used by various american 
embassies for internal communications and classified information on 
disarmament negotiations taking place in vienna

actress cybill shepherd and us rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo are among those expected to speak on 
abortion at the national womens political caucus convention here 
this week 
at the fourday convention opening thursday leaders plan to 
unveil a national plan to tap the voting strength of people who 
favor abortion rights in the wake of the us supreme court ruling 
giving states more latitude in governing abortion 
caucus chairwoman irene natividad said the organization will be 
targeting legislative seats in several states to diminish 
antiabortion strength 
i see choice the right to reproductive freedom as the 
politicizing issue for the women of the 90s the same way the era 
was the politicizing issue for the women of my generation the 60s 
and 70s said natividad 
in many ways it is perhaps a clearer issue for a lot of 
women because it hits a lot of women more directly era was more 
of a class issue or group issue choice is an individual issue 
she said 
the high courts july 3 abortion ruling is bringing a new sense 
of urgency to the biennial convention of the 77000member caucus 
whose goal for two decades has been to put more women in public 
office organizers say 
it changes the focus of the convention which is expected to draw 
1500 delegates alternates and guests said dede wolfson 
chairwoman of the minnesota womens political caucus and convention 
host 
the focus would not be predominantly on the abortion issue if 
the webster case hadnt occurred the focus would have been on how 
to get women elected well still focus on how to get women 
elected but there will be two major components at this 
convention she said 
in webster vs reproductive health services inc the supreme 
court upheld certain restrictive provisions of a missouri law on 
abortion 
natividad wolfson and minnesota officials who are caucus 
members look at the supreme courts ruling as an erosion of womens 
rights but not necessarily without political value 
its going to energize the womens movement said 
minneapolis city council member barbara carlson 
women have become so busy with their own lives and careers 
that what they needed was something like this to coalesce women 
for the first time i almost feel like the suffragettes must 
have felt they took to the streets i suspect women are going to 
do that again carlson said 
natividad said abortion rights will not move to the top of the 
caucus agenda if abortion restrictions tighten 
the caucus is the political arm of the womens movement and 
should remain committed to getting women elected to office though 
it will continue to be concerned with other womens issues she 
said

a conference of 19 countries seeking peace in 
cambodia has allowed china to break the diplomatic isolation 
imposed after the june crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing 
chinese foreign minister qian qichen met sunday with french 
foreign minister roland dumas and british foreign secretary john 
major 
he was expected to meet us secretary of state james a baker 
iii canadian foreign minister joe clark and others before leaving 
paris 
baker and qian were seated next to each other at the conference 
table where the foreign ministers were arranged in alphabetical 
order by the spellings of their countrys names in french 
us officials said on condition of anonymity that the two 
exchanged cordial greetings but did not discuss substantive 
issues 
president bush ruled out highlevel us visits to china after 
the military suppression of the prodemocracy movement but baker 
does not consider the ban a barrier to meeting with the chinese 
foreign minister outside beijing the officials said 
french officials said dumas meeting with qian kept strictly to 
the cambodia issue when qian noted with regret the cooling of 
bilateral relations dumas called attention to the reason for the 
chill they said 
canadian foreign minister joe clark told reporters that he would 
restate his countrys objections to the crackdown when he met with 
qian but said we wont have a solution to cambodia without the 
active participation of china 
china supports the khmer rouge the strongest guerrilla faction 
facing the vietnamesebacked government of premier hun sun most 
other countries contend that a chief aim of the peace process is 
finding a way to keep the khmer rouge from returning to power 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
during its threeyear reign of cambodia ended by a vietnamese 
invasion in 1978 vietnam is to withdraw its estimated 60000 
troops from cambodia by late september

something was missing at father edward 
flanagans famed home for boys 
a city without girls is like a hug without a kiss its good 
but its not enough said the rev val peter executive director 
of boys town 
so 10 years ago the first five girls came to the 1300acre 
campus on the western edge of omaha now 76 women count themselves 
among the more than 17000 alumni of flanagans home for troubled 
and abandoned youth 
about 400 of those alumni participated in a threeday reunion 
that ended sunday 
boys town provides care in a fosterhome setting to troubled 
children sent by courts social service agencies and churches and 
to a few children who arrive there on their own 
of the 526 current boys town residents 201 are girls aged 9 to 
17 peter said 
the transition was not always easy for the first groups of girls 
entering the village founded on flanagans belief that theres no 
such thing as a bad boy 
although she was not among the first five girls to arrive at 
boys town joni renken was one of the first five girls to graduate 
from boys towns high school in 1983 she remembers boys faces 
pressed against the windows in classroom doors as some of the 
pioneer girls entered the school 
it was weird because they were looking around at us and 
running into stuff she said saturday you were like so 
outnumbered 
there was little flirting between the boys and girls said 1987 
boys town graduate traci schacht 
more or less they treated me like a sister she said 
the addition of girls challenged a staff used to dealing only 
with boys peter said the gym teacher was not an early convert 
said mrs renken of lincoln who lived at boys town for one full 
school year and parts of two others 
gym class was one of the worst things because they treated us 
like boys and they worked us like dogs she said 
society was unaware of a problem with wayward girls when 
flanagan founded the home in 1917 or even when mickey rooney 
visited in 1938 for the filming of the famed movie boys town 
peter said 
an awareness of the need to reach out to troubled girls grew he 
said but the first five came by accident in 1979 for shelter 
they didnt have any place to go then we liked them so much 
we said they could stay and weve been taking them ever since 
peter said 
some of the boys that had been here a long time i think 
were kind of resentful that the girls were intruding on their 
space mrs renken said 
then they were really accepting overall i guess they had a 
change of heart it was like a brothersister relationship 
that is exactly the relationship peter hopes to foster 
i hold the capacity for friendship between a boy and a girl to 
be the key to all success in marriage and family if we cant be 
friends all the rest of it isnt going to hold us together 
there is a continuing debate about how many girls to enroll 
peter said 
the boys are warmly recommending we take more girls and the 
girls are warmly recommending that we not take any more girls they 
like the ratio just as it is he said 
mrs renken said the ratio was about one girl per 100 boys when 
she lived at boys town 
we liked the ratio when we were here too

the tamil tigers have started their own talks with premadasas 
government over ending their 6yearold separatist campaign in 
which at least 11000 people have been killed including about 
1000 indian soldiers 
the indian troops were supposed to disarm the tamil tigers and 
other militant groups under the peace accord which also promised 
limited autonomy to the minority tamils 
but the tamil tigers pulled out of the agreement and attacked 
the indian soldiers 
tamils most of whom are hindus form 18 percent of sri lankas 
population of 16 million they claim discrimination by the buddhist 
sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population and control

health care for veterans diminishing clout in 
congress and a visit by president bush comprise the agenda for the 
68th convention of the disabled american veterans which began 
sunday 
bush will be the first president to address the 11 million 
member organization said dav spokesman walter phillips 
bushs appearance here monday afternoon comes just months after 
he signed into law a bill elevating the veterans administration to 
cabinet level as the department of veterans affairs 
the convention comes amid concern veterans are losing some of 
their clout on capitol hill that notion must be reversed 
according to dav national commander billy e kirby of clifton 
texas 
it is your future in jeopardy your wellbeing thats 
threatened unless you get involved kirby told delegates 
attending the opening session sunday 
kirby said one of his proudest moments as head of the dav came 
this past spring when he went to the white house to witness a 
30yearold dream become a reality with the elevation of the va 
to cabinet status 
with a stroke of the presidents pen veterans stepped forward 
to the cabinet table and into the national policysetting arena 
kirby said in remarks prepared for the conventions opening session 
still kirby said there is concern that americas veterans lack 
clout in congress 
influential congressmen have repeatedly warned that our 
programs are in deep trouble if more veterans dont get involved 
he said 
we must find ways to harness the involvement and advocacy we 
see disabled vets practicing in their hometowns kirby said we 
must channel more of that enthusiasm for service toward washington 
and into the halls of congress 
veterans health care will be a major area of concern for the 
6000 people attending the convention according to phillips 
tommy clack who lost both legs and his right arm during a 
firefight in vietnam in 1969 was honored sunday as the disabled 
american veterans man of the year 
clack has worked for the past decade at atlantas veterans 
administration medical center where he spent much of his 21month 
recovery following his injury in vietnam 
clack 42 of stone mountain ga holds silver star bronze 
star and purple heart medals he has spoken about veterans issues 
in all 50 states 
god left me with my brain intact my mouth in gear and my left 
arm to be independent what else do we need in life he said in a 
recent interview were lucky to be alive and lets go forward

lebanons ambassador to iraq was quoted 
sunday as confirming that christian army commander gen michel aoun 
has acquired missiles and other weapons from iraq to bolster his 
war effort against syrian forces 
artillery duels raged between syrian and christian forces 
setting huge fires in residential districts in the citys moslem 
and christian sectors 
four people were killed and 52 were wounded in the shelling that 
began after sundown and continued for nine hours 
the casualties raised the toll to 506 killed and 2118 wounded 
since the current round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil 
war broke out march 8 pitting aouns 20000 troops against the 
syrians and their druse moslem allies 
fire brigades in east and west beirut said they were unable to 
battle the fires which gutted several apartment buildings and 
gasoline stations because of water shortages 
police said syrian gunners blasted aouns presidential palace in 
suburban baabda east of beirut with rockets and that aoun was in 
the underground bunker of the twostory building 
several shells exploded around the office of syrianbacked 
acting prime minister salim hoss officials said hoss was at his 
home about a mile away from his office 
aoun heads a christian military cabinet vying for legitimacy 
with hoss syrianbacked moslem government 
shells also hit near the buildings housing the associated press 
united press international reuters and the agence francepresse 
news agencies near west beiruts hamra commercial thoroughfare 
there were no casualties among journalists 
yes lebanon does possess frog7 missiles supplied by iraq 
hikmat awad lebanons ambassador to iraq was quoted as saying in 
the conservative beirut newspaper alanwar 
lebanon has much more sophisticated weapons which if 
revealed will make everyone forget about the frog7s awad was 
quoted as saying he did not elaborate 
awads confirmation was the first by a lebanese christian 
official that aouns forces have frog7s which can hit the syrian 
capital of damascus about 40 miles away if fired from lebanons 
central mountains in the christian enclave 
the report said awad spoke when he arrived in christian east 
beirut saturday for talks with aoun 
syria and iraq are governed by bitterly competitive wings of the 
arab socialist baath party 
aoun has vowed a war of liberation to drive out 40000 
syrian troops stationed in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the arab league 
it was not immediately clear why awad would confirm the presence 
of frog7 missiles when aoun has not the staterun iraqi media has 
previously said that frog7 missiles had been sent to aouns army 
awad did not say how many of the missiles aoun has the missile 
has a range of about 43 miles and carries a warhead of 1200 pounds 
of high explosives 
the syrians have been demanding the removal of the frog7s from 
the christian side as a precondition for a ceasefire and lifting 
of their land and sea blockade of the christian enclave 
syrian gunboats have been searching ships and syrian artillery 
has been shelling the coast to prevent supplies from landing at the 
enclave 
intransigence on both sides has stymied peacemaking efforts by 
an arab league summit committee made up of king fahd of saudi 
arabia king hassan ii of morocco and algerian president chadli 
bendjedid 
their foreign ministers met in rabat morocco on saturday to 
discuss new ways to stop the fighting in lebanon 
police estimate more than one million residents have fled beirut 
since march turning what was once the most glamorous capital in 
the middle east into a virtual ghost city

business has been slower than usual 
this summer at many east coast beaches but bad weather apparently 
is doing more to keep tourists away than the threat of pollution 
for the past two summers reports of washedup medical waste 
floating garbage and high counts of fecal coliform bacteria scared 
tens of thousands of tourists away 
to restore public confidence and protect the touristdependent 
economies of beach communities some states have undertaken 
massive weekly ocean water testing programs better information 
about the actual danger or lack of danger from pollution also has 
helped some say 
people are not panicking as much because theyre more 
informed said noreen bodman director of the new jersey division 
of travel and tourism they also know were doing all we can to 
keep the beaches clean and safe 
preliminary figures from virginia beach va show tourism was 
down 7 percent in june from last year but officials there are 
blaming the weather 
in rhode island a cool and rainy period in early july also 
caused the number of tourists to drop say tourism officials 
in rehoboth beach del tourism has fluctuated because of bad 
weather said city manager gregory ferrese 
i think the day trippers have decreased dramatically because 
of the weather conditions ferrese said 
on the other hand jones beach on new yorks long island has 
experienced one of the east coasts most dramatic increases in 
beachgoers between july 7 and july 26 last year 635000 people 
used the beach but that number rose to 11 million during the same 
period this year 
at rehoboth hotel and motel reservations for august are 
promising ferrese said in new jersey ms bodman predicted strong 
endofsummer turnout 
environmental reports suggest that bacteria contamination has 
closed back bays more often than ocean beaches largely because 
bays are often catch basins for storm runoff 
however ocean beaches have not been spared 
earlier this month 13 beaches in cape may county in southern 
new jersey including all beaches in the popular town of wildwood 
were plagued for several days by high bacteria counts after heavy 
rains that caused storm sewers to overflow 
but tourists did not stay away tourism experts point to 
educational campaigns that have taught the public what is dangerous 
waste and what is not 
storm water runoff for instance is a natural phenomenon that 
usually dissipates quickly 
syringes have been found on beaches in several states this year 
but havent prompted instant beach closures as in past years 
one new york official blamed the media for scaring tourists away 
from long island beaches by reporting on medical debris that washed 
ashore 
people were frightened about something they didnt know 
anything about said joseph lescinski superintendent of jones 
beach state park 
one episode demonstrated the importance of tourist revenue to 
beach communities a group of merchants dropped chlorine tablets in 
the ocean off cape may county in a futile attempt to kill bacteria 
other communities have mounted organized efforts 
in long island and new jersey helicopters are used for daily 
patrols of the waters new york harbor gets special attention to 
help target shorebound garbage slicks so they can be swept up 
before they reach the beaches 
since january new york city has covered its garbage barges with 
netting to hold down the 14000 tons of debris barged daily to a 
dump on staten island

the supreme court on sunday restricted the 
armys right to demolish homes of palestinians suspected of 
involvement in the uprising in the occupied lands 
in its strongest move to limit army powers in the 19monthold 
rebellion the court said the military must allow appeals before 
destroying houses a practice that has been denounced by the united 
states and other western nations and human rights groups 
in the occupied west bank soldiers shot to death a 17yearold 
palestinian the army and arab reporters said in the occupied gaza 
strip an israeli settler shot and killed a palestinian 
stonethrower after arabs barraged his car with stones a police 
spokesman said 
two other arabs died of wounds suffered in earlier clashes with 
soldiers hospital officials said 
police also arrested eight israelis on suspicion of fomenting 
rebellion as members of the free state of judea movement which 
calls for founding a jewish nation in the west bank 
the 18page supreme court ruling was in response to an appeal by 
the association for civil rights in israel 
the threemember court ordered the army to inform owners of 
houses slated for demolition that they could appeal to a military 
commander and the supreme court 
it said that in some cases a house may be sealed before the 
appeal hearing as opposed to demolition which is irreversible 
presiding judge meir shamgar also said the army has the right to 
immediately demolish a house in case of operational military 
needs such as in combat 
a military spokesman said 227 houses have been demolished in the 
occupied territories during the uprising palestinian groups say 
the number is higher 
the us state department in february said the demolitions 
violated the geneva conventions on human rights and ignored due 
process because suspects houses were torn down before they were 
tried 
the israeli foreign ministry responded by saying the measure was 
used only in very exceptional circumstances as dictated by 
compelling security requirements 
in court arguments the state prosecutors office and the army 
said an appeal period is granted automatically according to army 
policy except in serious and exceptional cases that involve 
fatalities or injuries 
justice minister dan meridor said in an army radio interview 
that there was no reason to change the law we are talking about 
the use of emergency regulations he said 
the civil rights association applauded the decision of the 
court which in the past has rejected a number of individual 
appeals involving house demolitions 
our association has always believed that the drastic step of 
demolition of houses is a form of collective punishment which 
is not justified said david presler a member of the 
association on israel radio 
however from the legal point of view the maximum we could do 
was to guarantee the procedural rights of people whose houses 
were about to be demolished 
since the uprising began in december 1987 at least 525 
palestinians have been killed in clashes with army troops and 
israeli settlers in the occupied lands thirtyeight israelis have 
died 
in addition palestinians have killed 85 fellow arabs accused of 
collaborating with israel during the uprising 
the army and palestinian sources gave conflicting reports on the 
death sunday of iyad abdullah abdel qader the 17yearold killed 
in the west bank village of ras karka the army said he was shot by 
soldiers who opened fire on stonethrowing youths along a highway 
villagers told arab reporters abdel qader was shot in the head 
at close range by soldiers who sneaked into the village saturday 
and opened fire without warning 
in the second incident a settler opened fire with a pistol 
after his car was stoned as it passed the arab town of beit hanun 
gaza police spokesman yigal golan said a 25yearold arab resident 
was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died on arrival golan 
said he would not release the victims name 
police identified the settler as david shtibi from the gaza 
strip jewish settlement of rafah yam 
at least 2500 jewish settlers live surrounded by almost 800000 
palestinians in the gaza strip 
also sunday farouk ata 25 a resident of the west banks 
tulkarem refugee camp died of wounds suffered last week in a clash 
with troops hospital officials said 
ahmad fattah ghaleb 18 died in a ramallah hospital sunday from 
stomach wounds suffered in a clash with soldiers in the west bank 
village of beit lid hospital officials said the army confirmed 
his death

the united states and other nations should impose 
economic sanctions against china for its violent suppression of the 
prodemocracy movement us sen paul simon said sunday 
simon dill speaking during closing ceremonies of the first 
congress of chinese students in the united states said the bush 
administration has followed the right direction in its response to 
the violent crackdown on protesters but now must take stronger 
action 
simon said he was opposed to restrictions on food and medicine 
but beyond that we should be joining other nations and we should 
be leading other nations to see that there are joint economic 
sanctions so that the government of china feels very very clearly 
the economic muscle that we put on the side of freedom 
simon congratulated the student group for reaching its main goal 
the creation of a federation to coordinate the efforts of chinese 
students in the united states and pledged his help to bring 
reforms to chinas communist government 
you and i have a mission and that mission is to bring freedom 
to all the people of china simon said prompting loud applause 
and cheering from many of the 400 conference delegates and 
observers gathered in a conference hall at the chicago campus of 
the university of illinois 
during the threeday congress attended by students from 200 
colleges and universities delegates also established duties for 
the new federation including lobbying other governments for 
support and publicizing their cause through demonstrations and 
sponsorship of an independent newspaper in the united states 
several journalists from opposition newspapers based in hong 
kong and taiwan attended the closing ceremonies along with eight 
dissidents who participated in the april and june protests in 
beijing conference organizers said neither the dissidents nor 
journalists addressed the crowd sunday 
speaking to reporters after his address simon said he and other 
congressional leaders have met with bush administration officials 
to press for a greater response to the june killings of 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijings tiananmen square and the 
continued suppression of their supporters 
the bush administration while resisting calls for economic 
sanctions has cut off sales of military equipment barred military 
and other highlevel visits and suspended us support of 
international bank loans 
simon said he understands the need for caution but added 
were talking about a very clearcut choice between oppression 
and freedom and in that kind of a clearcut choice i think we ought 
to stand up 
simon emphasized that the united states should maintain 
relations with the chinese government even while imposing sanctions

arsenic poisoning of her present husband the rev dwight moore 
still in a greensboro hospital on thursday the investigation 
expanded to nine possible poisoning victims eight of whom died 
she told me this whole scenario is like a nightmare stalking 
her her attorney mitchell mcentire said after visiting mrs 
moore in jail it keeps stalking her 
the investigation is ongoing and it will continue as long as 
police receive information said district attorney steve balog 
authorities were checking out every lead the prosecutor said 
including tips from the public 
this investigation is headed a long way from here said 
burlington police lt detective steve lynch 
on friday dr john butts of the state medical examiners office 
said an autopsy on mrs moores father parker d kiser sr showed 
he had ingested arsenic in the weeks before his 1966 death but 
that his death was actually caused by heart failure 
lynch said the investigation of kisers death remains open 
no immediate charges are planned until the investigation is 
complete and the district attorney has an opportunity to evaluate 
the case he said friday 
mrs moore has not been charged in any of the new investigations 
in no way are we implying that these people were murdered 
lynch said but as a result of some phone calls we began to have 
some unanswered questions 
mrs moore is scheduled to be arraigned aug 28 on the murder 
and assault charges 
shes a good christian lady who has lived her whole life 
quietly said her attorney now people are pointing fingers at 
her 
police began investigating mrs moore after moore was admitted 
to north carolina memorial hospital in chapel hill in may shortly 
after their honeymoon with an illness diagnosed as arsenic 
poisoning 
the probe raised questions about four deaths of people linked 
with mrs moore they included her father taylor reid and a 
former coworker mabel jessie parsons 
the bodies of taylor reid and kiser were exhumed for autopsies 
on wednesday lynch sent to butts the medical records of mrs 
parsons 61 and three more possible victims joseph m mitchell 
57 also a coworker ina p vinson a retired southern bell 
employee and john w reiber 77 
on thursday the list of possible victims grew to nine with the 
addition of mrs moores motherinlaw isla taylor 
mrs moore who declined a request for an interview maintains 
through her attorney that she is innocent 
the events of the last few weeks have sent a shock wave through 
the mill village of carolina on the outskirts of burlington where 
mrs moore lived briefly with her new husband prior to his 
hospitalization may 7 
nobody nobody suspected anything said wayne hackney who 
operates a small grocery store and gas pump near the 130member 
carolina united church of christ where moore began preaching five 
years ago 
the man didnt have any money hes just a preacher said 
larry johnson one of hackneys customers 
another customer who declined to give his name said id hate 
to be in her shoes if i did it or not 
mcentire said he asked mrs moore whether she had anything to do 
with the cases in which she is charged 
she said if the evidence is that they died of arsenic 
poisoning they either ingested it accidentally or someone did it 
in a fashion to make it appear she did it he said

jailed after a judge refused to accept his 300yearold violin to 
guarantee bail on charges he broke into a motel room on marthas 
vineyard 
fodor who has performed internationally and at the white house 
was held over the weekend on breakingandentering and cocaine 
possession charges after being arrested thursday in a motel room 
said tisbury police sgt justin welch on friday an edgartown 
district judge set bail at 50000 and refused to accept the violin 
fodor 39 is a native of denver who lives in new york city he 
gained fame in 1974 when he became the first american to share top 
honors at the tchaikovsky violin competition in moscow and he has 
recorded for rca 
the violinists father said he did not have any warning that his 
son may be in trouble until he learned of the arrest 
the first i knew about it was when i read todays paper 
eugene fodor sr of morrison a denver suburb said saturday fodor 
planned to travel to edgartown mass to attend his sons court 
appearance 
fodors exwife susan davis of vienna va said she was 
stunned to learn about fodors arrest and his attempt to use the 
violin as surety for bond 
davis who was married to fodor between 1978 and 1985 said 
fodor contacted her early friday because he wanted me to know 
what was going on 
he sounded very frightened and said he didnt have much time 
to talk davis said 
a family member in manhattan who spoke sunday on condition of 
anonymity said the incident likely stems from fodors recent drug 
problem which may be rooted in the very ferocity that fires the 
violinists creativity and craft 
the only explanation i can think of is that he does everything 
in a thorough way she said hes a genius in his work and he 
devotes all his energy to his work hes very intense in whatever 
he does 
hotel maids making early morning rounds noticed someone in a 
room that was listed as unoccupied said a manager at the vineyard

the government on sunday announced the end 
of food price controls and meat rationing despite warnings from 
solidarity and from a politburo member that the move could lead to 
huge price increases and unrest 
the announcement to go forward with former prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowskis controversial plan came one day after he 
was elected communist party chief to replace gen wojciech 
jaruzelski who stepped down after being elected president 
the plan which takes effect tuesday abolishes a sevenyear 
rationing program for meat 
it has been called illprepared by the solidarity trade union 
and by politburo member wladyslaw baka he quit as party secretary 
in charge of economic policy during the twoday party meeting that 
ended saturday after rakowskis election 
we cannot take responsibility for the social results of the 
operation being introduced by the government solidaritys 
national executive commission said in a statement there is a 
danger of outbreak of social dissatisfaction 
in his first public comment on the elevation of rakowski 
solidarity leader lech walesa told supporters outside st brygidas 
roman catholic church in gdansk he was not going to get involved 
in party matters i did not choose him party members chose 
him 
stanislaw debinski a solidarity representative for wroclaw 
said rakowski did more harm in nine months as prime minister 
than the other governments did in 40 years he is a guy who has the 
idea of maintaining the hardliners in power thats why he was 
elected 
although rakowski supports a radical restructuring of the 
economy he acknowledges he is linked more with the partys 
conservative elements than its reformist wing 
one of his first acts after becoming prime minister was to close 
the lenin shipyard where solidarity was founded nine years ago he 
also played a major role in defending the suppression of the union 
after the introduction of martial law dec 13 1981 
rakowski in the closing speech saturday to the meeting of the 
communist partys central committee said the party is not looking 
for a quarrel with the solidarityled oppositionbut we will 
fight back if provoked 
the official pap news agency published on sunday the text of his 
speech 
we do not have to drop down to our knees in front of our 
political opponent rakowski said we do not have to behave 
like a rabbit paralyzed by fear 
we are interested in real constructive cooperation with the 
opposition he said but if such constructive cooperation does 
not come about the nation soon will see who it can really trust 
rakowski has been widely criticized for his handling of the 
economy during his time in office inflation is in triple digits 
and many basic food supplies are in short supply 
pap said that under the new food program stores will be allowed 
to buy meat directly from farmers starting tuesday for whatever 
price they can negotiate ending an administrative price system and 
a system of official meatbuying points 
meat ration coupons which since 1981 allowed each family member 
to buy five pounds of meat monthly from stateowned shops at 
controlled prices will be abolished the announcement said 
consumers always could buy additional meat at higher prices from 
private stores but it was too expensive for many people 
rakowski has said farmers are withholding meat and grain from 
markets because the prices they get are insufficient he says the 
only way to pay them more to bring adequate supplies in stores is 
to charge consumers more 
the only food items whose prices will still be controlled are 
bread lowfat milk cottage cheese and milk formulas for infants 
the announcement said 
the program contains some money to compensate consumers for 
the higher prices but not enough to make up for the price 
increases pap said it said details would be published tuesday 
baka warned that food prices could triple or quadruple under the 
program he said those increases could lead to renewed wage demands 
unless precautions were taken before the operation such as 
stockpiling reserves to counter panic buying and help people on 
fixed incomes 
the present governments overwhelming desire to introduce 
market mechanisms regardless of real conditions has been one of the 
most important factors aggravating the economic as well as social 
sitiuation a party commission led by baka reported last week 
if the present line is continued the economy may eventually 
collapse which will turn society against the idea of reforming the 
economy to make it more marketgoverned 
jaruzelski was expected to present his choice for a new prime 
minister monday for approval by the parliament 
at the time of rakowskis election two regional party leaders 
regarded as hardliners were named to the ruling politburo as was 
a 43yearold party secretary known as a reformer four veteran 
politburo members resigned 
it appeared that rakowski was attempting to balance various 
party factions within the politburo before his election he had 
appealed in an interview for party unity he stressed the party 
must be pragmatic without losing sight of its marxist origins and 
must become a party capable of winning elections 
in polands freest elections in more than four decades last 
month the revived solidarity movement won 260 out of the 261 seats 
it was allowed to contest prompting the party to explore how it 
can start to rebuild public support

a federal judge must decide whether the 
cincinnati reds are participants or spectators in pete roses legal 
fight 
us district judge john d holschuh was to decide monday 
whether the federal courts or a judge in cincinnati should handle 
roses lawsuit against baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti 
for more than a month roses legal actions have kept the 
commissioner from deciding whether rose bet on his own team an 
offense that carries a possible lifetime ban the question of which 
court hears roses case is pivotal 
baseball wants the case in federal court where judges 
previously have upheld the sweeping powers of the commissioner 
rose wants it kept in hamilton county common pleas court where 
judge norbert a nadel has shown willingness to set precedents in 
his decisions 
to keep the case in state court holschuh must rule that the 
dispute is between two entities that reside or do business in ohio 
that would involve one of two findings that the case technically 
is between rose and the reds an ohio team or that major league 
baseball is an unincorporated association doing business in ohio 
through the reds thus subject to lawsuit in ohio courts 
however if holschuh decides the dispute technically is between 
rose and the commissioner of baseball a bartlett giamatti who 
lives in another state then the federal courts could have domain 
rose has blocked giamatti for more than a month from deciding 
whether rose bet on the reds 
the manager also has received protections from firing by the 
team or suspension by giamatti while the case is heard the 
protections extend for three days after holschuhs decision 
while lawyers for rose and giamatti have exchanged voluminous 
and sometimes sharply worded legal arguments the ballclub has kept 
a low profile 
the reds filed papers with holschuh saying they were maintaining 
a strict neutrality owner marge schott has declined to make public 
statements about the case while it is in court but admits shes 
unhappy it has dragged on so long 
and general manager murray cook says theres no thought being 
given to asking the courts for authority to remove rose if the case 
lasts beyond this season 
i dont know that we can cook said were not lawyers we 
just have to go by what the lawyers dictate at this time

three reputed mobsters were convicted sunday of 
federal racketeering charges stemming from the killing of a police 
officer in 1986 
frederico giovanelli 56 steven maltese 57 and carmine 
gualtiere 55 were found guilty of violating the federal 
racketeering statute loansharking interstate travel in aid of a 
racketeering enterprise and attempted murder 
the verdict came on the fifth day of deliberations following an 
11week trial the defendants were remanded to the metropolitan 
correctional center 
the three men are associated with the genovese crime family 
said us attorney benito romano 
gualtiere was described as a soldier who ran a huge gambling 
business that brought in hundreds of thousands dollars in revenue 
to him and the genovese family prosecutors said 
detective anthony venditti member of an organized crime task 
force was shot to death outside a diner in the ridgewood district 
of queens on jan 21 1986 during mob surveillance his partner 
kathleen burke was wounded when she tried to assist venditti 
romano said the defendants did not know venditti was a police 
officer and were afraid they were going to be ripped off 
gualtiere was acquitted of murder charges in state court in 
april 1988 the jury deadlocked in the case of the two others and a 
mistrial was declared the second in the case 
questions arose as to whether sundays conviction would 
interfere with the states effort to reprosecute the defendants on 
homicide charges due to the double jeopardy law romano said that 
would be decided by the state courts 
giovanelli faces up to 70 years in prison maltese faces 75 
years and gualtiere faces 50 years each could be fined in excess

two prominent communists captured 
last week were in the capital to promote new negotiations with the 
government but their arrest destroys any opportunity for peace 
rebels said sunday 
satur ocampo suspected chairman of the national democratic 
front and his commonlaw wife carolina bobbie malay were 
arrested thursday while driving along a residential street in 
suburban makati president corazon aquinos government said their 
capture was a major setback to the rebels 
in a statement to news organizations sunday the front said 
the arrest of satur and bobbie comes at a time when the ndf is 
offering a serious and bold proposal to the aquino regime and to 
the nation 
the front referred to an offer to resume peace talks to end the 
20yearold insurgency if mrs aquino agrees to close the six us 
military bases here in 1991 
despite great risks to their security these two comrades left 
the revolutionary bases in the countryside and went to the capital 
to work on the ndf proposal the statement said 
the rebels said the government had disregarded the peace offer 
and its eagerness to show off a prize catch to please its 
imperialist master the united states overrides any concern for 
peace and destroys any opportunity for peace 
the statement was signed by renegade rebel antonio zumel who 
along with ocampo and ms malay negotiated on behalf of the 
insurgents during peace talks that broke down in january 1987 
ocampo ms malay and other rebel leaders went underground in 
february of that year after a twomonth ceasefire expired 
the front is a coalition of 12 marxist groups including the 
communist party of the philippines and its armed wing the new 
peoples army the military has said ocampo served on the partys 
central committee and its politburo 
mrs aquino has refused to enter new peace talks unless the 
rebels first agree to lay down their weapons last week she said 
the government had not received any formal offer from the front to 
resume peace talks 
mrs aquino has refused to say whether she will support 
extending the lease on us military bases after it expires in 
1991 she is expected to visit the united states later this year 
for preliminary discussions on a new base treaty 
a treaty must be approved by twothirds of the 23member 
philippine senate where opposition to the installations is strong 
in its statement the front praised the ocampos for their 
courage and steadfastness in the hands of the enemy and urged 
them to continue promoting the rebels peace proposal in prison

the owner of mississippis leading black 
newspaper in the 1960s worked for the segregationist sovereignty 
commission according to newly released records of the defunct 
state agency 
percy greene who operated and edited the jackson advocate from 
1938 until 1977 promoted the commissions views with telegrams 
letters articles and speeches some prepared for him by 
commission director erle johnston the records state 
a federal judge last week ordered the records of the commission 
which tried to thwart civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s 
be opened to the public the judge barred the state from enforcing 
a law making it a crime to disclose the records which had been 
sealed since 1977 
the complete papers in the archives of the mccain graduate 
library at the university of southern mississippi in hattiesburg 
were made available to the clarionledger on friday in an agreement 
with the attorney general the papers cover johnsons 
administration from 1964 until 1968 
greenes efforts and payments made to him from 1964 until 1967 
are outlined in commission records contained in the personal papers 
of gov paul b johnson jr 
a document dated dec 9 1965 shows johnston wrote remarks 
about race relations in mississippi for greene to use during 
national television news interviews while at a los angeles 
newspaper rally 
a lot has been said about the murder of three civil rights 
workers in neshoba county there has been criticism that they have 
never been tried in a state court for murder reads the fourpage 
typewritten letter labeled observations for percy greene 
greene also was supposed to defend state officials who refused 
to prosecute the case 
the truth of the matter is that the federal bureau of 
investigation handled all of the interrogations and accumulated the 
evidence johnston wrote in the document 
johnston also suggested that greene criticize the us 
department of health education and welfare for threatenting to cut 
off funds to mississippi public schools unless they desegregated 
such a decision would hurt the colored students more than the 
white students the letter reads 
greene founded the advocate in 1938 and ran it until his death 
in 1977 
there was always suspicion that he was getting paid said 
myrlie evers widow of medgar evers the mississippi naacp field 
secretary assassinated in 1963 i do recall at one point a 
meeting held at our home where people were discussing percy greene 
and what he was doing 
charles tisdale bought the paper in 1978 and is its publisher 
and editor today 
i have some of his correspondence to the sovereignty 
commission im not surprised at anything tisdale said saturday 
of greene 
the president of mississippis chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people aaron henry of 
clarksdale was a member of the newspapers board of directors 
during tisdales tenure 
he said greene wasnt secretive about working for the 
sovereignty commission 
the commission obtained subscriptions of the advocate for public 
schools henry said saturday 
percy had his problems with integration but percy was a 
strong advocate of voting rights henry said 
the presentday advocate is completely different from 
greenes era henry said 
its really the voice of civil rights for this state he

a major stock scandal involving britains biggest 
bank is rocking the city of london prompting demands for tougher 
policing of one of europes most important financial districts 
the controversy known as the blue arrow affair has led to the 
reluctant resignation of the chairman of the bank national 
westminster plc and the abrupt departure of eight other people 
from a variety of posts in the city 
chairman lord boardman protested that senior bank officials who 
werent directly involved have been unfairly singled out but the 
affair has damaged the banks bluechip reputation and perhaps its 
expansion into investment banking 
an official report severely criticizing the conduct of natwest 
officials in the 1987 sale of shares in blue arrow plc an 
employment services agency reflected a government move to crack 
down on financial shenanigans in britain 
the furor has also raised questions about the adequacy of the 
countrys selfregulatory framework set up after the october 1986 
deregulation of the nations financial markets called the big bang 
british style of leave it to an old boy network was all right 
when the old boys had standards said legislator john smith 
financial affairs spokesman for the opposition labor party were 
in a world of global finance now where these things are swept 
aside we need tough enforcement 
the blue arrow affair follows what is known as the guinness 
scandal in which the giant brewer guinness plc admitted that its 
former management arranged for third parties to buy guinness stock 
the intention apparently was to inflate the share price and make 
guinness ultimately successful 1986 cashandstock offer for the 
liquor company distillers co more attractive than a rival bid 
seven men including guinness deposed chairman ernest 
saunders are awaiting trial on criminal charges 
i think its very clear to me standards in the city have 
fallen dreadfully smith said at a recent gathering of the 
association of american correspondents in london weve now got a 
whole series of these things 
the latest controversy grew out of blue arrows audacious 13 
billion acquisition of the much larger manpower inc of the united 
states in 1987 creating the worlds largest employment services 
agency 
the official report issued july 20 by the department of trade 
and industry after a sevenmonth probe criticized natwest 
officials over the unsuccessful 837 million pound or about 14 
billion sale of blue arrow shares to raise funds for that takeover 
county natwest ltd a securities unit of natwest kept shares 
that didnt sell failing to disclose a holding of more than 95 
percent for three months the trade department found misconduct and 
a breach of british laws requiring timely disclosure of a stake of 
more than 5 percent 
london metropolitan polices serious fraud office is considering 
whether criminal charges should be brought 
the securities association a selfregulatory body says it is 
investigating the conduct of four firms and 24 individuals in the 
case the bank of england also is looking into the affair 
boardman natwests 70yearold chairman and three other 
directors resigned july 25 after an emergency meeting of the board 
of directors in addition five other people have left their city 
posts due to the scandal 
the british press reported that the central bank has pressed for 
an appropriate response 
there obviously is an element of government crackdown on the 
city in this said tim clarke a banking analyst with the london 
investment firm citicorp scrimgeour vickers the government wants 
to be seen as fairly hard on the city 
boardman said he accepted ultimate responsibility for natwests 
serious failings but he said he stepped down also because he 
felt the report unjustly criticized the other three directors he 
himself was not singled out 
the three were criticized for conduct that fell below that to 
be expected from responsible senior executives 
natwest has paid the price of inadequate supervision the 
times of london wrote 
clarke said the affair underscores how difficult it is for banks 
to move into the securities business which was opened up to them 
under big bang 
it also underlines the difficulty in complying with the new 
complex regulations he said investment firms also have complained 
that theyre expensive to follow 
smith the labor lawmaker called for the establishment of a 
government regulatory body modeled after the us securities and 
exchange commission 
the government has transferred the responsibility for regulating 
the financial services industry to a 17member securities and 
investments board a new nongovernment watchdog body with 
statutory powers the board has approved five selfregulatory 
organizations including the securities association

the last american maker of 
16millimeter movie projectors is calling it quits a victim of 
japanese competition and the rise of videotape 
kalart victor corp which makes movie projectors educational 
television products audio visual and film editing equipment plans 
to close its plant monday said the companys president leonard j 
quartin 
quartin said the 67yearold company has struggled since the 
early 1980s when video cassette recorders and handheld camcorders 
became popular 
the companys products halfway between the 35mm film used for 
hollywood movies and the 8mm film once popular for home movies 
were purchased mostly by schools governments and businesses for 
instructional use 
kalart victor made projectors for every us embasssy in the 
world and supplied some city school systems with projectors for 
each classroom the city of los angeles alone bought thousands of 
projectors from the company quartin said 
but the rise of vcrs meant that instructional films could be 
shown on television a much easier technology for teachers and 
companies to use quartin said 
the ease of using a cartridge or cassette far outweighs the 
steps in making movies where you have to put reels on the 
projector quartin said 
the interest in vcrs created a decline in 16 millimeter 
projectors and film he said home movies have disappeared 
taken over by camcorders 
at its peak during the 1970s kalart victor employed 250 people 
recently there have been less than 50 people working at the plant 
quartin said kalart victor is the last company in the united 
states producing 16mm movie projectors he said three japanese 
producers will now have the entire market albeit a small one to 
themselves japanese companies also dominate the vcr market 
as recently as 10 years ago he said there were five us 
companies making the projectors which grew in popularity after 
world war ii 
at one time the industry produced 100000 projectors per year 
the number has dwindled to about 15000 quartin said 
the only reason to have 16 millimeter now is to use it for a 
large audience quartin said since it can be projected on a 
large screen

an attorney whose son is a striking eastern 
airlines pilot contends that easterns courtappointed bankruptcy 
examiner should be disqualified from the case because of an alleged 
conflict of interest 
the lawyer moreton rolleston jr contends in a motion sent to 
us bankruptcy court in new york that examiner david i shapiro 
cannot be completely impartial in easterns restructuring 
because shapiros son works for a law firm representing the airline 
shapiro said friday that his son james a secondyear law 
student at georgetown university is working for the washington 
office of weil gotshal amp manges handling environmental cases the 
new yorkbased firm is representing eastern but the younger 
shapiro is not handling any aspect of the case his father said 
i asked everybody if there was an objection there were 
none shapiro said if there had been james would have taken 
another offer 
rolleston whose daughterinlaw is a flight attendant also on 
strike against eastern said shapiro must be like caesars wife 
that is not only within the law but above suspicion 
shapiro took offense at rollestons remarks 
i view it as an attempt to attack me through my son i dont 
like it shapiro said 
one of shapiros tasks as examiner is to investigate allegations 
by the striking unions that texas air corp parent firm of the 
airline has stripped away eastern assets to benefit the parent 
company and sister carrier continental airlines 
shapiro said friday he does not expect to report his findings 
until september 
rolleston said he sent the motion last week to us bankruptcy 
court but as of friday it had not been filed with the clerk the 
attorney made copies of the motion available friday to reporters 
this is the second time rolleston has intervened in the eastern 
case in april he petitioned the bankruptcy court to appoint a 
trustee to run the airline during the reorganization claiming that 
since he had earned mileage in easterns frequent flier program he 
was a party to the case the request was not granted

a federal judge has eliminated ralston 
purina cos right to continue to enforce a patent used for the 
production of purina dog chow 
us district judge michael mihm ruled thursday that in 1975 
st louisbased ralston purina fraudulently obtained the patent for 
the process used to make soy protein a prime ingredient of purina 
dog chow attorney terry grimm said friday 
ralston purina said it planned to appeal 
the cereal and pet food maker had filed a lawsuit against ae 
staley manufacturing for violating its patent 
in ruling against ralston purina mihm cited arguments of the 
attorneys for decatur illbased staley that purina did not 
disclose information in a dutch publication that explained a 
similar process developed by food processor archer daniels midland 
co 
grimm the attorney for staley said that while the ruling does 
not revoke ralston purinas patent it does mean that the company 
will no longer be able to sue those who use the process 
grimm said those seeking patents at the us patent office have 
an obligation to report any information they may have about items 
or processes for which they seek patent rights

garfield is going to the dogs literally 
the feline cartoon character will help alpo petfoods inc better 
known for its dog food launch its new line of cat food 
alpo the leading seller of premium canned dog food will have 
its alpo brand cat food on supermarket shelves nationally in 
november or early december said judi kroeger an alpo spokeswoman 
garfield will proclaim on the label that the product is good 
enough for me 
the allentownbased company a division of the british 
conglomerate grand metropolitan plc plans a multimilliondollar 
campaign to sell the product 
were really pleased that jim davis garfields creator has 
worked with us since 1987 as the product was being developed ms 
kroeger said hes very particular about the items that garfield 
will endorse 
ms kroeger said alpo which has researched and developed its 
cat food for the last five years believes it is financially 
prudent to enter the market 
the dog food market is limited in its business growth 
potential because the dog population is declining she said 
the cat population is increasing so cat food is one area that 
companies can look to increase their business 
in 1983 alpo bought the tabby cat food company which sells 
only in the new england states it followed by buying blue mountain 
co which markets dog and cat food in the northwest 
alpo commissioned a sevenmember panel of veterinary and 
nutrition experts to help develop the new cat food ms kroeger 
said the food was tested at alpo and independent facilities 
its competition on the catfood shelves will include ralston 
purina cos purina brand and hj heinz cos 9lives 
we know that these are strong brands and are not aiming to 
overtake them by tomorrow afternoon said katherine a hillman 
alpos vice president for marketing garfield will certainly 
assist in the initial trial and the products quality and 
palatability will ensure strong repeat business 
in 1988 alpo maintained its lead in the premium canned dog food 
market by accounting for 28 percent of the estimated 920 million 
market according to maxwell consumer report the company also 
advanced from fourth to second in dry dog food and dog snacks

the crippled tanker exxon valdez and flotilla 
of escort boats entered san diego bay on sunday arriving for 
repairs four months after spilling millions of gallons of oil into 
alaskan waters 
hundreds of people watched from shore as the ship pushed by 
tugboats entered the bay and rounded north island passing 
waterfront hotels and navy warships harbor seals stared from atop 
buoys 
its a wounded dinosaur said rick nadeau of greenpeace the 
environmental group which sent boats out to check for oil in the 
tankers wake 
families with cameras jockeyed for the best shooting positions 
with news photographers and television cameramen 
joggers and bicyclists joined the crowd that stretched about 500 
feet along the shore to marvel at the highriding vessel inscribed 
with the name exxon in bright red letters 
several people waved branches with feathers attached a silent 
protest on behalf of the birds killed in alaskas prince william 
sound when the exxon valdez hit a reef and spilled 11 million 
gallons of oil on march 24 
a number of protesters hoisted signs that read no oil 
spilling no ocean killing and end of the exxploitation 
the strains of john lennons song imagine were heard above 
the drone of a coast guard helicopter hovering over the tanker 
and as the tanker glided under the coronado bridge the crowd 
took on a carnival atmosphere vendors hawked 7 tshirts that read 
american wilderness love it or leave it alone and oil 
profit cant buy back the environment 
the tugs pushed the ship to a pier at the national steel and 
shipbuilding co for a ninemonth 25 million repair job ending a 
2500mile voyage from alaskas and the nations worst oil spill 
coast guard lt larry solberg said no oil discharges were 
spotted at the pier the tanker was encircled by a floating orange 
containment boom 
it ended today very quietly and we were pleased it ended 
quietly exxon shipping co president frank iarossi told 
reporters at the dock 
iarossi again denied the ship was the source of at least three 
oil slicks off the coast as charged by state fish and game 
department officials 
im denying the valdez spewed oil he said there was no 
oil on that ship people are losing sight of that fact 
he disclosed that exxon may try to remove the stigma of the 
spill from the ship by changing its name 
rechristening wouldnt be in order but we are considering 
whether we should start a new career for the vessel with a new 
name he said 
the 987foot tanker was allowed in as far as the pilots buoy 
outside the harbor at 11 pm saturday after inspection the port 
captain coast guard cmdr don montoro gave final clearance 
the ship reached san diego three weeks ago but was turned away 
as a pollution risk and had to stay about 50 miles offshore while 
exxon negotiated with five state agencies for permission to enter 
california waters 
during that time divers cut away dangling steel plates that 
ripped from the ships hull en route from alaska that was 
necessary so the tanker could navigate shallow sections of the bay 
entering the harbor the ship rode high with the top of the 
rudder and propellers exposed 
coast guard and harbor patrol boats guarded a security zone 
around the tanker ships with pollution containment and salvage 
equipment followed 
among dozens of surrounding pleasure boats were greenpeace boats 
with crews watching for signs of oil in the wake 
oil spills kill said a banner with a skull and crossbones 
on one boat change the course steer toward sane energy said 
another 
greenpeace activist kelly quirke said they were not protesting 
the ships arrival but what it represents 
it represents a fossilfuel energy policy that is not only 
destroying the ocean but the atmosphere quirke said 
the repair job stirred excitement at the shipyard where the 
tanker was built in 1986 shipyard managers expect to add 300 
people and boost the workforce to 3000 sixty laidoff workers 
were to be recalled immediately said peter zschiesche a 
representative of the machinists union 
theyve been calling me every day wanting to know when is 
the ship coming in when can we go back to work he said 
under exxons agreement with the state the valdez had to be 
leakfree for the 24hour period before entry and accompanied by a 
pollution response vessel 
exxon put up 20 million in a bond and a trust account to insure 
its performance and cover cleanup costs in the event of a spill in 
local waters
