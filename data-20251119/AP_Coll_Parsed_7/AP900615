jury selection in the second bensonhurst racial 
slaying trial ended thursday but the defense attorney argued the 
panel couldnt be impartial because of widespread pretrial 
publicity 
the jurors four of whom are black will decide the fate of john 
vento 21 who backed out of a deal with prosecutors to trade 
testimony for immunity 
in march vento was charged with murder riot assault unlawful 
imprisonment and other crimes in the slaying of yusuf hawkins 16 
hawkins who was black was fatally shot in august after he and 
three black friends were chased through predominantly white 
bensonhurst by a mob of batwielding whites 
the four black teens were unarmed and had gone into the brooklyn 
neighborhood to look at a used car for sale 
joseph fama 19 convicted last month in hawkins death was 
sentenced on monday to the maximum 32 and twothirds years to life 
in prison 
keith mondello also 19 was acquitted of murder and 
manslaughter but was convicted of riot unlawful imprisonment and 
discrimination he received the maximum 5 13 years to 16 years in 
prison 
judge thaddeus owens rejected a request by ventos attorney 
gerald dichiara to postpone the trial and scheduled opening 
arguments to begin monday 
dichiara requested that ventos trial be put off for at least 
two months arguing that the national attention the murder and 
trial has attracted made it impossible to find an impartial jury 
i still believe that the timing of this jury selection is 
improper and i do believe the jurors are under a strain to be fair 
and impartial dichiara said 
after the shooting vento reportedly told detectives he saw fama 
shoot hawkins he testified before a grand jury investigating the 
case and was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
agreeing to take the witness stand against his friends 
but he backed out of the deal and fled the city around christmas 
in march after forcing a onemonth delay in the start of famas 
and mondellos trial vento surrendered to the fbi in dayton ohio 
he is being held without bail

the us justice department is investigating 
usair group inc for possible antitrust violations involving its 
operations at greater pittsburgh international airport the company 
said 
in a may 31 action known as a civil investigative demand the 
justice department ordered the company to produce documents and 
other information relating to activities at the airport 
usair said it was informed by the justice department that other 
airlines and other airports are being investigated 
usair group is the parent company of usair which is the largest 
tenant at the pittsburgh airport and handles a substantial number 
of the flights there 
the probes existence was disclosed recently by usair in 
connection with the issuance of 846 million in revenue bonds for 
construction of a new terminal at the airport 
a justice department spokesman frank kelly declined to comment 
on the nature of the investigation he said the civil investigative 
demand is equivalent to a subpoena but does not mean a civil or 
criminal action has been undertaken 
usair spokesman john bronson said the airline would comply with 
the justice departments request and was gathering all relevant 
documents he said he did not know the exact nature of the justice 
department inquiry 
the solicitor for allegheny county which has a business 
relationship with usair relating to the new terminal said the 
request for information appears to be part of a broader probe the 
investigation probably involves fares charged by airlines at hub 
airports said solicitor ira weiss 
a report issued last year by the general accounting office found 
that fares charged at 15 hub airports were about onefourth higher 
than fares charged at 38 other airports served by a larger number 
of carriers 
the study found that fares charged at pittsburgh were as much as 
8 cents per mile more than fares at the 38 airports 
weiss said one aspect of the usair probe involves its dealings 
with the county the airline and the county negotiated a longterm 
lease two years ago for construction of the 592 million terminal 
according to the bond statement the justice department is 
examining possible violations of the sherman act by conduct 
activities or proposed action relating to restrictions on 
facilities at the airport 
the sherman act makes it illegal for companies to restrain trade 
in the united states or with foreign countries or to conspire to do 
so it also prohibits monopolizing trade or commerce in the united 
states or with foreign countries or attempting or conspiring to do 
so 
weiss said he believed the investigation arose out of usairs 
large share of traffic at the pittsburgh airport 
in 1987 the justice department opposed the merger of usair and 
piedmont airlines but dropped its objections after determining the 
consolidation would not hurt competition

war and rain have made a rusty steel 
cable 50 feet above a swollen river the umbilical cord between half 
of morazan province and the rest of el salvador 
isolation that has come with every rainy season since 1983 when 
guerrillas blew up the bridge makes a hard life harder for the 
50000 people north of the torola river 
they are virtually cut off from may to october when the river 
is too deep for even trucks to ford 
the people of this town nestled among mistshrouded hills pray 
for the war to end 
salt cooking oil sugar almost everything except the corn 
beans and coffee they grow must be hauled along the cable in a 
precarious iron gondola the gondola also is the only transport for 
a mother and sick child who must reach the provincial capital san 
francisco gotera 
the region along with the northern half of chalatenango 
province to the west is the zone hit hardest by a 10yearold 
civil war that has brutalized this small central american country 
rebels destroyed the bridge to hamper the movement of army 
troops soldiers have entered the area by helicopter since 
perquin is a guerrilla bastion 75 miles northeast of san 
salvador most of the 600 residents seem to support the farabundo 
marti national liberation front whose fighters can be found on 
street corners talking with townsfolk 
on the last sunday in may about 400 rebels mustered in the main 
square to hear a speech from the top guerrilla field commander 
with scores of villagers looking on several dozen fighters 
received shoulder patches distinguishing them for valor during and 
since the big rebel offensive in november 
the people of this town nestled among mistshrouded hills pray 
for the war to end strict limits are imposed on the amount of food 
each family may take north from the provincial capital each month 
medicine boots adult clothing and flashlight batteries there 
is no electricity north of the torola are considered war materiel 
and are confiscated at roadblocks 
some kinds of fertilizer are banned because they can be used to 
make explosives 
ive grown tired of arguing with them said juan jose 
rodriguez a farmer riding in the back of a truck from perquin to 
the river they refuse to accept the obvious truth that we who 
are not guerrillas also need shoes and clothing and batteries 
because they have suffered in greater measure the people of 
perquin want peace perhaps even more than the rest of their 5 
million countrymen 
we cant take anymore said modesto diaz a 61yearold 
farmer peace would be the best thing but it is not a simple 
matter of laying down the guns there have to be changes and 
accords first 
diaz said the army killed his brother and a nephew in 1983 
someone incorrectly reported them as guerrillas so the 
soldiers came and killed them he said they didnt bother to 
investigate 
trinidad ramos has spent all his 75 years in and around perquin 
cultivating corn and beans 
his callused feet and gnarled almost nailless toes were shod in 
thicksoled sandals and he sat on a porch observing life through 
hornrimmed glasses mended at one hinge with green string 
if it hadnt been for the idiocy of the war this town would 
have prospered he said god willing it will end soon 
government and rebel representatives met for five days in may in 
caracas venezuela to set an agenda for concluding the war the 
unsponsored talks are the most promising in six years but great 
differences must be resolved 
townspeople in the square nodded as commander jorge melendez 
declared our society is captive to the military our democracy 
is captive to militarism 
the rebels demand demilitarization beginning with a purge 
of human rights abusers from army ranks and a steady reduction of 
troop strength they say the goal should be abolition of the armed 
forces in the midterm perhaps within five years leaving a 
civilianrun police force to keep order 
president alfredo cristiania rightist government has 
acknowledged that when the war is over el salvador will not need 
such a large army 
government spokesmen decline specific comment citing the 
agreement of the two sides on strict confidentiality 
officials have said in private however that the 56000member 
security forces could be reduced by about 60 percent after a peace 
agreement took effect

the violence that marked romanias 
overthrow of nicolae ceausescu always seems ready to explode a 
product of the bloodiest communist rule in eastern europe and 
centuries of ethnic and political strife 
the overwhelming victory of presidentelect ion iliescu and his 
national salvation front in may five months after ceausescus 
ouster only heightened the traditional divisions in society 
iliescus triumph left the opposition with little power to exert 
political pressure on him and debate moved into the streets 
the press with several exceptions offers little constructive 
criticism enflaming rather than calming passions 
we destroyed the political power of communism but the social 
economic and administrative structures are in their place and that 
is the second phase of the revolution stelian tanase editor of 
the weekly 22 said in an interview 
predicting chaos in the next six months as the economy 
deteriorates and workers start to strike tanase said the salvation 
front will gradually lose power 
for now however iliescu can rely on the communist structures 
he inherited virtually intact to enforce his will 
he summoned tens of thousands of supporters into the streets 
thursday the tactic only added to wednesdays violent clashes 
between antigovernment demonstrators and security forces 
iliescus backers clubbed opponents to the ground ransacked 
opposition party offices and demanded a ban on the independent 
newspaper romania libera 
their actions feed on fear of a changing future and ignorance of 
democratic institutions bred by five decades of communist or 
fascist rule 
by casting himself as the guardian of those workers and their 
interests iliescu has limited his ability to maneuver for change 
iliescu is prisoner of the apparatus of the engine on 
which he jumped said thomas kleininger vice chairman of a 
leading intellectual group the group for social democracy in a may 
interview 
he could have the best intentions but he cant do what he 
wants kleininger said of iliescu 
the almost unique chance to take now the road of genuine 
democracy and join in the flow of european values has been missed 
at least for a while with amazing carelessness the daily 
romania libera wrote after iliescus may 20 election 
the failure to dismantle communist structures in romania leaves 
in place the terror bred by one of the most brutal instruments of 
repression in eastern europe 
after world war ii romanias communist party was merely a few 
hundred dedicated marxistleninists mostly trained in moscow but 
those communists used a mixture of political intrigue and bloody 
repression to seize power 
tens of thousands of peasants and intellectuals were either 
killed or died working on public projects 
communist leader gheorge gheorgiudej died in 1965 paving the 
way for the initially more liberal rule of ceausescu cultivated by 
the west as a communist maverick he built up trade ties taboo 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
gradually however ceausescus rule grew more and more harsh 
by last december when he was ousted in a popular revolt backed by 
the army his 23 million citizens lived in terror of a network of 
securitate secret police and informers 
intellectuals say iliescu and the salvation front exploited this 
fear to inflate the violence of the revolution the front allowed 
rumors that tens of thousands died to run unchecked and continually 
warned of the danger from securitate agents battling soldiers 
psychological terror blended with real danger during the 
revolution to make those figures believable in the months since 
the government has quietly admitted the death toll was much lower 
just over 1000 it has never said how many securitate agents it 
captured or killed 
everywhere in eastern europe the secret police has proved the 
most perfidious aspect of communist rule its legacy in romania is 
stronger because the terror was greater 
the problem in romania is compounded by greater ethnic 
differences and greater economic devastation than elsewhere in 
eastern europe 
ethnic tensions could explode as they did in the transylvanian 
town of tirgu mures in march when clashes between ethnic 
hungarians and romanians left at least six people dead 
the nationalist tensions of the balkans whose varied peoples 
remember centuriesold battles as if they occurred yesterday were 
kept in check by communist repression now as elsewhere they find 
freer expression in romania

fearing a rise in terrorist attacks police are 
using people power to fight back a campaign around new delhi seeks 
to educate residents on how to ferret out terrorists and spot 
potential bombs the reward a safer city and maybe some cash for 
helpful tips 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if antiterrorist squads have their way 
new delhis landlords will be more inquisitive citizens more 
cautious and growling watchdogs ever viligant 
fearing a rise in bombings linked to two separatist movements 
police this week launched a citywide campaign designed to help 
uncover terrorists and thwart attacks 
the basic idea is to create security awareness said new 
delhi deputy commissioner of police neeraj kumar 
although the focus of the effort is terrorism police are also 
warning that general crime around the nation is expected to rise by 
100 percent during the decade according to government estimates 
the crime prevention week program has an added significance 
in indias capital where 16 people have been killed and 109 
injured this year in bomb blasts blamed on sikh militants 
authorities are also worried another separatist battle waged by 
moslem factions in the northwestern state of jammukashmir will 
spread to the capital at least 300 people have died since 
government troops began a crackdown in the province in january 
new delhi is a favorite target of the extremists and any 
crimeprevention program in new delhi in the present circumstances 
cannot ignore terrorism said a senior police officer who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
around the city of about 6 million residents posters urge to 
keep a lookout for terrorists a leaflet how to terrorize 
terrorists is being distributed along with free door chains 
police are also conducting seminars on safety measures and 
appealing to people to adopt a puppy which could become a 
formidable watchdog cash awards are now offered for helpful 
information about extremists 
since january seven bombs have exploded in new delhi in 
addition several highpowered explosive devices were found and 
defused one was discovered in the crowded new delhi railway 
station 
several suspects have been arrested in connection with the 
blasts but no one has been convicted 
sikh militants fighting for a separate homeland in the rich 
farming state of punjab have been blamed for many terrorist 
attacks since the early 1980s 
in 1985 a series of bombs often concealed in transistor 
radios killed at least 87 people in the capital two years later 
sikh gunmen fired on a birthday party south of new delhi killing 
nine people and injuring 14 
sikhs have been blamed for more than 5000 deaths around the 
nation since 1987 
former prime minister rajiv gandhi has ordered high walls and 
watch towers around his new delhi residence for fear of attacks by 
sikhs who assassinated his mother prime minister indira gandhi 
in 1984 
this weeks antiterrorist campaign is paying special attention 
to landlords who police say often rent apartments without checking 
tenants identification and background 
to instill fear in the terrorists mind be sure about the 
credentials of your tenant says one police leaflet 
and potential bombs could be anywhere or anything authorities 
warn 
always be alert for unattended luggage while traveling in 
buses look out for passengers behaving in a suspicious manner if 
you spot any suspiciouslooking object do not touch the object it 
may be a bomb according to a police statement 
at least one police official said the campaign has been 
successful 
just try leaving your camera at any major intersection nobody 
will pick it up and it will lie unclaimed for weeks said the 
official who wished to remain anonymous 
crime prevention week is scheduled to move throughout new 
delhis 100 precincts in coming weeks

critics of a proposed constitutional amendment 
against burning the american flag claim it is being rushed through 
as ammunition for fall campaigns but sponsors say it should move 
faster 
everybody seems to understand that we have to get this done 
before the elections in november sen dale bumpers dark said 
thursday you dont have to be a rocket scientist to see whats 
driving this thing 
the comment came as part of an outpouring of flag day rhetoric 
in congress that focused on the amendment to allow the federal 
government and the states to ban burning or otherwise defacing the 
american flag 
beyond washington the flag marked its birthday by being raised 
praised frozen and burned as the debate over the national symbol 
rolled across america 
make our day try and burn these flags pinkos read the 
sign in a chicago parade elsewhere in the city thats just what 
some of them did members of the revolutionary communist youth 
brigade burned flags outside the art institute where an exhibit 
was shut down last year because of its controversial depiction of 
the flag 
in vermont the state archivist suggested another amendment to 
protect the flag gregory sanford said the very federal law that 
says how many stars and stripes must be on the flag should be 
amended to require that the flag be made out of fireproof material 
that way if a flag catches fire its not a real one and doesnt 
count he said 
a california peace activist froze a flag in a cake tin and 
displayed it to reporters as he called for a freeze in nuclear 
weapons im really burned up about this flag amendment said 
jerry rubin who is not related to the more famous activist of the 
same name 
in pittsburgh the observance was traditional as boy scouts 
sang america the beautiful raised a flag and rang a replica of 
the liberty bell 
a 54 supreme court decision monday scrapped last years 
statutory ban on flag burning setting the stage for the drive to 
amend the constitution 
the proposed amendment could be on the house floor as early as 
next week 
the senate judiciary committee plans hearings next week and 
sponsors say a floor vote could come before the fourth of july 
although that is not certain 
to become part of the constitution the measure would have to 
get twothirds support in both the house and senate and win 
ratification by 38 state legislatures 
flag day furnished lawmakers with an occasion to give full vent 
to their views on the highly charged issue 
far from rushing the measure the senate is moving too slowly 
said minority leader bob dole rkan 
weve already had hearings weve been down that route we 
dont need any more hearings we ought to bring the bill to the 
floor lets have a vote dole said 
he served as master of ceremonies for a rally at which veterans 
in american legion caps along with tourists wearing cameras on 
straps swarmed over the capitol lawn to hear partisans of the 
amendment call for action 
if they want to set their britches on fire fine sen phil 
gramm rtexas declared just dont set the symbol of the 
freedom they claim allows them to protest on fire 
on the senate floor sen bob kerrey dneb said he was 
dismayed to see a picture of dole holding an american flag at the 
white house and president bush laughing 
its a great loss when the president of the united states is 
doing this pointing and laughing laughing using this moment 
taking political advantage kerrey said 
i am ashamed of what he did 
sen john c danforth rmo broke with conservative colleagues 
to oppose the amendment he told the senate that whether the flag 
should be honored is not the issue in the debate 
what will be before our country is whether we should amend the 
constitution of the united states in such a way as to pare back the 
bill of rights whether the time has come to whittle away just a 
little bit and in one particular fashion on the first amendment 
to the constitution he said

swiss authorities have imposed an 
immediate ban on imports of british cattle and beef as a precaution 
against mad cow disease 
a government statement thursday said the measure was designed to 
prevent products banned from european community markets being sold 
to switzerland which is not a member of the 12nation trading bloc 
the swiss ban includes all live cattle beef on the bone and 
cattle feed made from animal byproducts 
mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy a

imports as part of an ec compromise a meeting of ec farm ministers 
agreed to limit british exports of live cattle to calves under six 
months of age and to introduce a certification system showing that

airlines will have to use better xray 
machines and pay closer attention to checkedin luggage under new 
federal directives responding to a presidential commission on 
terrorism 
transportation secretary samuel skinner and federal aviation 
administration chief james busey announced several security steps 
thursday including creation of two highlevel posts to oversee 
transportation security 
busey said airlines would be required to replace older 
lesssensitive xray machines with modern ones that have higher 
detection standards for carryon luggage xrays however cannot 
detect plastic bombs 
metal detectors that passengers walk through also would have to 
be upgraded under the new orders 
airlines flying outside the united states will have to further 
inspect checkedin luggage and match it to passengers and will be 
required to report to the faa any threat that could affect us 
civil aviation 
taken together these initiatives represent building blocks in 
a system that will justify even higher levels of passenger 
confidence in the safety of air travel already our safest mode of 
transportation skinner said 
but the announcement did not address several key recommendations 
in the may report by the panel that investigated government 
response to aviation terrorism skinner said other proposals still 
are being examined 
the commission looking into the deaths of 270 people in the 
december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland called for major reforms in government security 
operations it said the lockerbie bombing may well have been 
preventable 
the sevenmember panel proposed preemptive and retaliatory 
military strikes against terrorists a system to notify passengers 
of credible terrorist threats and other steps to avert terrorist 
strikes both in the united states and abroad 
faa administrator busey said he would convene a government team 
of researchers security specialists engineers and explosives 
experts to recommend an integrated security research and 
development program to be implemented by sept 1 
an faa program to install sophisticated bomb detectors at 150 
highrisk airports around the world has been stalled since the 
commission report the panel recommended that it be set aside so 
moreeffective methods of detecting plastic explosives can be 
explored 
the transportation departments new office of intelligence and 
security will oversee all transportation security efforts it will 
be headed by vice adm clyde e robbins who will leave his post as 
commander of the coast guards pacific area and maritime defense 
zone 
a new post of faa assistant administrator for civil aviation 
security also is being created but no appointee was announced 
former labor secretary ann mclaughlin who headed the 
presidential commission said thursday she was very encouraged 
by the initial actions 
theyre doing what they can to make the kinds of changes we 
all know are necessary she said 
sen frank lautenberg dnj a commission member also praised 
the actions 
he said he is working on legislation that would meet some other 
commission goals federal security managers at domestic airports 
tighter controls on cargo better training of airport personnel and 
compensation for terrorism victims 
none of those items was addressed in skinners actions 
another panel member sen alfonse damato rny said the 
response was a good start but he urged appointment of faa 
security managers at key airports right away because we cannot 
allow the present system to continue 
the commission which had a budget of 1 million was officially 
dissolved today

for 40 years the army grumbled about pvt 
beetle bailey hes a real misfit they said lazy no spit and 
polish drives the sarge nuts hell never make corporal let him 
peel potatoes forever 
then one fine day somebody in the pentagon with silver stars on 
his shoulders looked around the table and told the men with silver 
eagles on their shirt collars hey you know the little guys 
funny 
yes sir they all replied nodding in unison 
and so it was that an incredulous mort walker a cartoonist who 
once slogged through the mud at fort leonard wood mo as an army 
draftee in world war ii was ushered into the pentagon on thursday 
and given a heros welcome 
walker who created the beetle bailey comic strip in 1950 could 
hardly believe it for years he had braved the armys fire when 
beetle and the gang zero sgt snorkel lt fuzz gen halftrack 
did something foolish 
on thursday he blinked before tv lights in the pentagon 
briefing room generals slapped him on the back praised him to the 
skies and asked for his autograph one of them gave walker a framed 
certificate of appreciation for patriotic civilian service with 
a ribbon in red white and blue 
the war was over 
i cant believe im actually here walker said as hard as 
it is to find anything in the pentagon they finally found a sense 
of humor 
through it all you have entertained us although sometimes we 
havent always liked it said brig gen bill mcclain the armys 
public affairs chief 
mcclain confessed that he reads beetle bailey and i laugh at 
it and others do too 
maj gen richard e stephenson said beetle bailey is the 
vehicle that enables us to see the lighter side of our profession 
and keeps us from taking ourselves too seriously 
the army brass wasnt always that charitable they thought the 
strip presented an unflattering image of army life that beetle was 
a poor role model for modern gis 
the tokyo edition of the stars and stripes military newspaper 
drummed beetle off its pages in 1954 because the strip poked fun at 
officers although the official explanation was that beetle 
bailey had a low interest value 
stars and stripes banned the strip again in 1970 as did some 
southern newspapers when walker introduced a feisty black 
character named lt flap who complained about sarges honky 
outfit feminists protested miss buxley the bosomy secretary to 
gen halftrack 
all was forgiven thursday the citation said walkers 
ingenuity in portraying army members in a humorous manner has 
contributed significantly to the morale of our soldiers as they 
provide for our national security 
the cartoonist also joined the generals in the pentagons 
sunsplashed inner courtyard to watch a cakecutting ceremony 
marking the 215th birthday of the army 
walker gave army officials a diorama based on his special flag 
day cartoon which appeared thursday in the more than 1800 
newspapers worldwide that carry the syndicated beetle bailey strip 
the diorama will hang permanently in a hallway near the pentagons 
main entrance 
two lifesize beetle and sarge figures who accompanied walker 
roamed the corridors waving to pentagon secretaries and exchanged 
salutes from passing generals and admirals 
mcclain the army public affairs boss summed up the situation 
if you cant laugh at yourself something is intrinsically wrong 
with you

police in many states have a green light to 
use sobriety checkpoints to combat drunken driving but some 
including a supreme court justice say that tactic will not work 
the high court on thursday upheld michigans checkpoint program 
and by extension similar operations in most states 
critics say checkpoints where all motorists heading in one 
direction are pulled over and detained briefly are not as 
efficient as other methods used by police to catch drunken drivers 
or keep them off the road 
we must begin to assure that every community will make 
checkpoints a key element of an allout campaign to finally rid our 
roads of the menace posed by drinking drivers said micky sadoff 
national president of mothers against drunk driving 
we know that checkpoints are one of the most effective weapons 
to combat drunk driving she added 
brian oneill of the insurance institute for highway safety a 
research group funded by the insurance industry agreed 
checkpoints are a very effective way of creating deterrents he 
said we can never catch all the drunks so what we have to do is 
create programs to deter the offenders 
but nadine strossen general counsel of the american civil 
liberties union said police sobriety checkpoints not only trample 
constitutionally protcted privacy rights but are ineffective 
theres not a smidgen of evidence that these tactics are more 
effective than the traditional constitutional method used by 
police officers to observe traffic and stop those cars that raise 
suspicions she said 
its more effective to use the same number of cops to watch 
traffic in areas where drunk driving has been a problem and have 
them look for those who might be under the influence ms 
strossen said 
the high courts vote thursday was 63 and one of the 
dissenters discounted the effect checkpoints have had or will have 
on drunken driving 
sobriety checkpoints are elaborate and disquieting publicity 
stunts justice john paul stevens said quoting various 
statistics from federal studies he concluded the net effect of 
sobriety checkpoints on traffic safety is infinitesimal and 
possibly negative 
the court ruling will have no effect in at least one state 
police in louisiana are barred from setting up sobriety checkpoints 
by their state constitution which affords greater individual 
privacy than does the federal constitution 
and police in michigan may have to wait to reinstate their 
checkpoint program state courts had invalidated it for violating 
the federal constitutions fourth amendment which bans 
unreasonable police searches and seizures 
now the state courts must resolve a challenge based on the 
michigan constitution 
in other decisions thursday the justices 
ruled 54 in a virginia case that hospitals and nursing homes 
may sue in federal court to challenge how a staterun medicaid 
program reimburses their costs 
decided unanimously in a case from massachusetts that the 
federal government may impose severe fines against air polluters 
even when regulators are slow to decide on cleanair proposals 
allowed the bush administration by a 54 vote in a virginia 
case to limit how much welfare aid some needy families receive

fighting roosters are bred to kill and 
die in a flurry of talons spurs and feathers but 65 of the birds 
soon may be sent to their deaths by lawyers 
maine officials want a judge to permit them to destroy the birds 
seized two months ago in a raid but they are being hampered by the 
legal novelty of the case in maine which isnt often the site of 
cockfights officials said 
this is a new process that we havent dealt with a great 
deal said clyde f leclair director of the state animal welfare 
board we havent had this in a long time long before my time 
its the first case in the state that i know of said janet 
t mills the androscoggin county district attorney 
the roosters were seized april 14 at a property in rural wales 
about 50 miles north of portland they were first taken to an 
animal shelter in nearby wiscasset then transferred to their 
current quarters at the university of maine in orono 
bert langelier owner of the property where the birds were 
seized faces a felony animal fighting charge mills said thursday 
twenty other adults who were rounded up at the cockfight have 
pleaded guilty to misdemeanors 
but at a hearing last month auburn superior judge thomas e 
delahanty ii refused the states petition to destroy the birds 
saying that langelier has said he wants to take care of them 
the birds must be stored in 65 separate cages at all times or 
they will kill each other officials said if the birds so much as 
look at each other they go into a frenzy and try to escape their 
cages 
theyre very difficult animals to deal with mills said 
from what i understand theyre bred and raised only for fighting 
and killing other animals 
the state said it would seek permission at a hearing june 26 to 
destroy the birds 
langelier whose home telephone is unlisted could not be 
reached to comment

authorities captured four more fugitive 
members of a west german terrorist squad in east germany the 
government news agency adn said friday 
the arrests bring to six the number of reputed west german 
terrorists arrested the past 10 days in east germany where 
authorities said they were allowed to live by the former communist 
government 
all six are said to be key members of the red army faction a 
violent leftwing group that claimed credit for a series of 
bombings and murders of prominent businessmen in west germany 
during the 1970s and 80s 
a reputed terrorist wanted in west germany for 13 years was 
reported thursday to have told police that east germany gave her a 
phony identity and let her build a new life 
her statement to authorities was reported by east germanys 
interior minister who has pledged to cooperate with west germany 
in tracking down terrorists shielded by the old communist 
government 
susanne albrecht one of west germanys most wanted terrorist 
suspects was sought in the 1977 shooting death of a top west 
german banker she was arrested june 6 outside her east berlin 
apartment 
officials on wednesday arrested another reputed west german 
terrorist inge viett who had been living in the east german city 
of magdeburg 
ms viett wanted in several terrorist attacks dating to 1972 
told east german authorities she was willing to cooperate and had 
renounced terrorism said the east german interior minister 
petermichael diestel 
both women are believed to be prominent members of the leftwing 
red army faction 
both women had been living in east germany under assumed names 
diestel said thursday that ms albrecht in the police 
statement said she was set up with a new identity by the stasi 
the feared secret police of the old communist government 
she said she was sent by the terrorist group to live in east 
germany in 1979 because she believed she posed a security risk 
after the 1977 slaying of dresdener banks president juergen 
ponto outside frankfurt 
however diestel said ms albrecht never admitted a role in any 
terrorist activities and did not refer to the red army faction by 
name saying only that she worked with an antiimperialist 
organization 
she said she later met with a contact for the secret police in 
east germany diestel said 
she said she was informed that the east german government 
disapproved of the groups methods but agreed with its 
antiimperialist objectives the interior minister said 
both ms albrecht and ms viett are being held pending expected 
extradition proceedings to west germany 
diestel said it was speculation whether there were other 
terrorists hiding in east germany but said whoever goes into 
the forest and finds two mushrooms will continue to search 
western officials have long contended that the former communist 
government either endorsed trained or condoned leftist terrorism 
the stasi one of the most skilled and feared intelligence 
networks in the world is believed to have trained the secret 
services of several other countries including those linked to 
terrorism 
diestel has come under fire in recent months for keeping 
hundreds of former stasi agents in the interior ministry which is 
responsible for domestic law enforcement 
west german officials said that news of ms albrechts 
whereabouts came from a tip by a former stasi member 
west german officials also received a tip in 1986 that ms viett 
was living in east germany and passed it on to the former communist 
government 
however the east germans took no action against ms viett said 
christiane kleinschmidt a spokesman for the west german federal 
prosecutors office in wiesbaden west germany 
ms vietts involvement in terrorism goes back to 1972 when she 
allegedly took part in a bombing that killed one man at a boating 
facility in berlin 
west german authorities have accused ms viett of also taking 
part in the murder of a west berlin judge guenter von drenkmann 
in 1974

a temperance movement is making gains 
in alaskas native communities 
more than 100 villages with large eskimo indian or aleut 
populations have approved alcohol restrictions since 1980 when the 
legislature began enacting laws letting communities ban the sale 
importation or possession of alcohol 
sobriety is not a dirty word any longer there is a real 
spirit in the community that supports change said carla bonney 
health director for 800 athabascan indians living in or near the 
village of tanana 130 miles west of fairbanks 
but temperance laws alone dont eliminate alcohol use 
bootlegging usually is rampant in remote areas where dry 
villages abut wet villages authorities say 
statistics bear out the extent of alaskas alcohol problem 
the state is third behind new hampshire and nevada in 
percapita alcohol consumption says the national institute for 
alcohol abuse and alcoholism the institute says alaskans drink the 
equivalent of 4 gallons of pure alcohol per person each year 
compared with the national average of 288 gallons 
alaska has twice the national average of accidental deaths and 
70 percent are alcoholrelated according to a 1982 state report 
suicide rates in rural alaska quadrupled during the past decade 
and doubled in urban areas state officials believe 80 percent of 
suicide deaths are alcoholrelated 
the alaska judicial council in 1980 linked 100 percent of rural 
murders 80 percent of violent felonies and 56 percent of property 
crimes to alcohol 
alcohol problems are often most acute among natives an 
estimated 30000 eskimos 5000 aleuts and 15000 indians who 
make up about 10 percent of alaskas 500000 population 
nearly half of all native communities have voted for alcohol 
restrictions 72 villages prohibit the sale and importation of 
liquor 21 have outright bans on possession and 11 others have 
either banned sales of liquor or restricted sales to communityrun 
or package liquor outlets 
the sobriety movement once was limited mainly to urban areas 
because thats where the states socialservice agencies operated 
but now its spreading to the countryside said george mundell 
regional program coordinator for the state office of alcoholism and 
drug abuse 
in some cases whole villages are living an alcoholfree life 
he said 
more and more theres an awareness and understanding that 
folks can get ahead of these alcohol problems and that they are 
preventable mundell said 
theresa tiny devlin of the alaska federation of natives 
which set up a commission in 1988 to study alcohol abuse among 
natives said the temperance campaign is starting to really 
blossom 
in tanana tribal leaders and village officials have worked 
together to tackle alcohol problems bonney said onethird of the 
profits from a statelicensed liquor store in the village goes to 
the tribal government for alcohol programs 
liquor store receipts in tanana dropped 40 percent last year 
over the previous year and the number of alcoholrelated accidents 
has fallen dramatically bonney said 
bootlegging and moonshining however remain overwhelming 
problems in remote areas said roy minatra an investigator for the 
alaska state troopers bureau of drug enforcement 
in the western alaska community of kotzebue where the sale of 
liquor is banned a bottle of rum goes for 80 in bethel a bottle 
of whiskey would fetch about 65 
the drugenforcement bureau has assigned two investigators to 
deal with drug and alcohol law enforcement among 160 villages in 
western alaska and state troopers are aggressively promoting a 
yearold reward system to persuade villagers to turn in liquorlaw 
violators for cash 
as much as 250000 is on offer but so far there have been few 
takers because the program is littleknown officials say 
the emphasis on prohibitionstyle laws is not without its 
critics 
prohibition doesnt work said bonney it didnt work for 
the us in the 1920s if people want to drink they are going to 
find a way 
she said lasting change will come only when young people are 
educated about the dangers of alcohol abuse and whole communities 
change their attitudes

france long proud of its unmatched commitment to 
black africa now is groping for the proper response to a wave of 
protests against undemocratic regimes that it has helped sustain 
while democratization in eastern europe was welcomed 
unreservedly by the west africa poses a policy dilemma without 
clear solutions 
france with its own revolutionary heritage will not repudiate 
the intensifying cries for change in gabon the ivory coast 
cameroon and other former colonies yet there are worries in paris 
that the abrupt ouster of incumbent regimes even if corrupt or 
repressive might unleash ethnic strife and economic chaos without 
ensuring progress toward democracy 
french officials insist they will not walk away from the 
problem and there is much talk about discreetly nudging current 
leaders in the direction of reform several presidents for the 
first time are at least paying lip service to the concept of 
multiparty elections 
but to some critics frances discretion is merely covering up a 
lack of strategy 
across the continent tumultuous situations require new 
ideas said the independent parisbased magazine jeune afrique 
or young africa france is wooed by the governments and the 
opposition but for the first time its african policy seems to 
have broken down 
if france perhaps knows what it wants it doesnt know how to 
achieve it said the magazine one of several in paris to devote 
recent cover stories to francophone africas turmoil 
we must say that we will no longer blindly support compliant 
dictatorships said jacques barrot an opposition leader in the 
centrist united democratic front if we dont quickly state this 
policy we soon will have no alternatives except repeated military 
interventions or abandoning africa to chaos and misery 
recent riots in gabon gave france a glimpse of what might lie 
ahead antigovernment protesters briefly abducted a french 
diplomat and french soldiers who soon arrived were widely viewed 
as propping up president omar bongo despite official insistence 
that their only task was to protect european expatriates 
both bongo and the ivory coasts octogenarian president felix 
houphouetboigny have treaties providing for french troops to 
support their governments during internal strife as well as against 
foreign incursions 
but french officials say there is little likelihood now of 
direct military intervention either on behalf of an african leader 
or against one such as operation barracuda of 1979 when 
french troops helped topple the central african republics 
selfproclaimed emperor jeanbedel bokassa 
the postcolonial period is over said foreign minister 
roland dumas its up to africans to resolve their problems 
other former colonial powers britain portugal and belgium 
have invested less of their international prestige in the 
continent and have not emulated frances familial relationships 
with african leaders 
ironically the united states never an african colonizer 
faces dilemmas similar to the french in liberia and zaire 
recipients of extensive us aid 
american diplomats have urged authoritarian presidents mobutu 
sese seko of zaire and samuel k doe of liberia to allow political 
pluralism but neither zaires fragmented opposition nor liberian 
rebel leader charles taylor has obtained formal backing in 
washington 
in france socialist president francois mitterrand has a 
longstanding reputation as an advocate of third world interests 
but some critics say european affairs now preoccupy him at africas 
expense 
he will be under pressure to convey a clearcut message on human 
rights when he plays host to the biennial francoafrican summit 
meeting june 1921 
more than 25 african leaders many facing emboldened domestic 
opposition are expected at the summit in la baule a resort on 
brittanys coast of love but the summit may prove less than 
amorous with the africans demanding more debt relief while france 
lectures them on democracy 
cooperation minister jacques pelletier who oversees french aid 
to africa summarized current government thinking at a news 
conference last week there is no true development without 
genuine democracy 
but he said multiparty systems while a good thing are 
not the only method for attaining democracy 
a more blunt assessment came from former premier jacques chirac 
a conservative multiparty politics he said is a sort of 
luxury that developing countries dont have the ability to 
provide themselves 
last years upheavals in eastern europe galvanized africas 
political dissidents so did the dramatic changes in south africa 
long a favorite target of indignation from black african leaders 
when the great satan of south africa legalizes its 
opposition and frees its worst enemies the secondrate dictators 
elsewhere find themselves very much alone said the leftist paris 
daily liberation 
africas political turmoil coincides with bleak economic 
conditions unmanageable foreign debt falling export income 
population growth exceeding food production french businesses are 
looking elsewhere for profits that are more reliable and less 
tainted by corruption 
pelletier says the number of french firms in africa has dropped 
by 25 percent from its peak many companies are eyeing eastern 
europe as a preferable venue 
france currently provides more than 25 billion annually in 
bilateral aid to subsaharan africa compared to 893 million 
allocated by the united states for the coming year 
more than 125000 french expatriates live in the region 
hundreds of french firms operate there and 14 countries base their 
currency on the franc france has persisted in backing some 
currencies so doggedly that several are overvalued by 30 to 50 
percent inhibiting serious economic reforms 
france has defense treaties with six subsaharan countries and 
deploys about 6600 soldiers there

a college student honored in her home county 
as the dairy princess was convicted thursday of murder for 
strangling another young woman in a quarrel over a man they both 
dated 
jurors deliberated about 7 hours before returning the verdict 
against lori esker 20 the charge carries a mandatory sentence of 
life in prison 
in closing arguments prosecutors said ms esker of hatley 
planned to kill 21yearold lisa cihaski the defense said the 
slaying was selfdefense 
defense attorney stephen glynn asked jurors to reject 
prosecution assertions the killing was premeditated 
if you use your logic use your common sense you are going to 
find reasonable doubt glynn said 
but prosecutors disagreed saying the length of time ms esker 
had to hold a belt around ms cihaskis throat before she died 2 
to 8 minutes proved ms esker intended to kill her 
jurors began deliberations late in the afternoon after marathon 
county circuit judge michael hoover spent an hour giving the panel 
final instructions 
the closing arguments ended a weeklong trial during which the 
prosecution portrayed ms esker a successful student and 1989 
marathon county dairy princess as a spurned lover obsessed with 
winning back her former boyfriend dairy farmer bill buss 26 
district attorney greg grau said ms esker was so obsessed with 
buss that she plotted then killed ms cihaski 21 of birnamwood 
in tearful testimony early in the trial buss told jurors he had 
ended a oneyear relationship with ms esker and began dating ms 
cihaski whom he planned to marry 
the farmer said ms esker twice sneaked into his home and tried 
to seduce him after their breakup he said he spurned both advances 
ms esker allegedly drove 150 miles from the university of 
wisconsinriver falls where she was a student created a false 
alibi then killed ms cihaski during an argument in a hotel 
parking lot 
glynn said that when a fight broke out ms esker used a belt to 
defend herself her lack of a weapon deflated prosecution arguments 
the killing was preplanned he said 
during thursdays proceedings ms esker wiped away tears and 
looked down at the table in front of her frequently scribbling on 
a yellow legal pad

texas aampm university experiments may have been 
intentionally contaminated to get results that proved cold fusion 
a prominent science journal said in a report published today 
despite widespread rumor that the aampm cold fusion results were 
manipulated university officials have yet to conduct a formal 
investigation according to science a widely read journal 
published by the american association for the advancement of 
science 
the result is that after a year of experiments that most 
scientists view with a great deal of skepticism anyway the aampm 
researchers are still haunted by this specter of possible fraud 
the journal said 
john fackler dean of the college of science at aampm said he has 
no evidence of fraud and no plans to investigate the cold fusion 
experiments 
i have no concrete evidence of anything other than possibly 
fairly sloppy chemistry he said in an interview 
cold fusion experiments in the aampm laboratory of john bockris 
last year were among the first in the world to report finding 
tritium a form of hydrogen that can be key evidence of a fusion 
reaction 
fusion is the merger of hydrogen atoms into helium with the 
release of substantial energy it is the principal reaction of the 
sun and of thermonuclear weapons and is believed by most 
scientists to require hydrogen atoms to be compressed and heated to 
millions of degrees 
cold fusion in which the reaction would take place and 
liberate energy as heat at ordinary temperatures would be a 
stunning and unexplained scientific breakthrough 
bockris reported the tritium within weeks after stanley pons at 
the university of utah and his colleague martin fleischmann 
announced to a stunned scientific community that they had achieved 
fusion in a laboratory jar 
the utah announcement set off a worldwide scramble to confirm 
the possibility of cold fusion but most experimenters could not 
duplicate the ponsfleischmann results and the concept now has few 
supporters among scientists 
the journal science said aampms quick findings of tritium gave 
early support of the ponsfleischmann findings and were 
instrumental in a decision by the state of utah to invest 5 
million in cold fusion research aampm the magazine said received 
an additional 150000 from the electric power research institute 
yet science said suspicions were raised almost from the 
first that the tritium in the aampm cells experiments was put there 
by human hands 
bockris declined to comment and other members of his staff 
referred questions to university officials one member of his 
research group doctoral candidate nigel packham told science he 
and bockris were not ready to abandon their results 
the magazine said some scientists had suggested the tritium 
detected in the aampm experiments was a result of someone 
deliberately spiking the chemical analysis 
science said bockris and his team reported finding tritium on 
numerous occasions including six different experiments in one 
week while scores of other laboratories around the country could 
find nothing or reported tritium at levels of only a fraction of 
that reported by aampm 
the magazine said that although suspicions of fraud arose 
bockris did not act on suggestions by colleagues to secure the 
experimental apparatus and protect it from tampering 
although the origin of bockriss tritium may not be resolved 
for years the tritium episode has become a case study in the 
damage done when questions of fraud legitimately raised are not 
seriously addressed by either the lab chief or his institution 
science said 
the journal article also said the aampm case raises crucial 
questions about how rumors and allegations of fraud should be 
investigated while ensuring academic freedom and protecting the 
reputations of scientists

for years the conventional wisdom about 
african countries was that they were not wellsuited for political 
pluralism under democracy political parties would be formed along 
tribal instead of nationalist lines africans were better off under 
oneparty rule 
or so it was thought 
such notions are becoming increasingly anachronistic these days 
as more and more african governments faced with restive 
populations are tinkering with multiparty systems 
it used to be that the handful of democratic countries 
senegal gambia mauritius and botswana were considered the odd 
men out curiosities on a continent of presidents for life and 
predatory military establishments they now seem to be in the 
vanguard of a continentwide movement 
conservative authoritarians such as the ivory coasts felix 
houphouetboigny as well as leftist ideologues like benins mathieu 
kerekou have legalized opposition parties a variety of other 
nations including gabon zaire zambia and tanzania seem to be 
following suit in islamic north africa algeria this week held its 
first free elections in the countrys 28 years of independence 
nigeria which has been under military rule for 20 of its 30 
years of independence is embarked on transition to democratic rule 
the political ferment is partly an outgrowth of what happened 
last year in eastern europe 
the wind that is blowing in the east should not stop in the 
south says jacques pelletier frances minister for cooperation 
and development the same wind has been blowing from latin america 
where a stampede to democracy took place over the past decade 
wisdom comes at 60 said zaires mobutu sese seko after 
announcing in april that he would allow two additional parties to 
compete for power mobutu reportedly had his change of heart after 
seeing on television the bloodsplattered remains of his onetime 
friend and colleague romanias nicolae ceausescu who was executed 
last december 
kwadwo o akpan who heads the washingtonbased angola peace 
fund debunks the notion that singleparty rule has minimized 
ethnic rivalries 
the leaders of these states are very often perceived to have 
permanently installed members of their in group as leaders of the 
party and therefore as rulers of the country akpan says 
accordingly he says the governments policies and its 
pretense of being representative are seen by the vast majority as 
being false 
as in eastern europe the success of africas experiment in 
pluralism is still in doubt because the continents democratic 
roots do not run deep few however underestimate the problems 
associated with the strongman rule most africans have endured for 
the past generation 
chester crocker the reagan administrations top official for 
african affairs traces africas political transformation to 
shocking economic decline as well as the widespread absence 
of political accountability raw abuse of power rampant nepotism 
and corruption and the suppression of nongovernment 
organizations 
crocker says that when africas independence process began in 
the 1960s westerners were far too indulgent of the dictatorial 
regimes that emerged 
we westerners acted as if it would be unfair impolite or 
downright dangerous to expect african systems of governance to meet 
universal norms he says 
south africas nelson mandela who arrives here next week is at 
the center of what could be a revolutionary democratic change away 
from the countrys discredited apartheid system 
last march namibia became independent from south africa with 
timely help from the united nations namibians have managed to 
avoid the oneparty misrule so evident elsewhere in africa namibia 
began independent life as few countries on the continent have 
with an elected government an independent judiciary and numerous 
curbs on executive power 
there is another contrast whites instead of being expelled 
are being encouraged to remain in namibia key ministerial posts 
have gone to whites 
one of africas most noteworthy holdouts against democratization 
is kenyan president daniel arap moi whose kenya africa national 
union has brought stability as well as prosperity 
we are being asked to risk that which we have so painstakingly 
built in order to lead up to some generalized universal 
prescription of political behavior moi has said

eastern europe could be an important new 
market for agricultural products in a few years but an agriculture 
department analyst predicts the competition will be fierce 
these countries are already aiming to join in world trade as 
full partners and extend liberalized access to their market said 
miles lambert of the departments foreign agricultural service 
competition for eastern european market shares is already 
gearing up with the european economic community having an 
advantage because of its proximity also he said some eec members 
are resuming traditional special relationships with some of the 
eastern countries 
notably these include west germany with czechoslovakia and 
hungary and france with romania 
lambert writing in the july issue of agexporter magazine said 
eastern europe will be attractive to the eec as a region in which 
to market surplus farm output 
however he added the relatively high costs of eec 
farming and low nearterm purchasing power of east europeans means 
the eec will probably need to resort to export subsidies to 
undercut the competition 
the united states is pushing for a reduction or elimination of 
tradedistorting national policies including export subsidies 
during the current uruguay round of negotiations under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
export subsidies particularly by the eec have been a sore 
point for many years in the united states which has been using a 
subsidy program of its own the export enhancement program to 
counter pricecutting competition 
lambert said that for most of the past 40 years food 
consumption in eastern europe was strictly subordinated to 
other state priorities meaning that consumers had to make do with 
what was available 
hence the long lines and empty shelves that characterized 
communist rule he said 
the shift to competitive market economies however means east 
european farm and food enterprises will have to be responsive to 
consumer demands 
at the same time democratization is bringing consumerism to 
the forefront of economic policy lambert said it is even 
possible that national food policies aimed at upgrading food 
quality and nutrition will be set out and become as much a 
cornerstone of agricultural poliy as mercantile considerations have 
been 
leaders in eastern europe no longer talk about selfsufficiency 
in terms of domestic production supplying food requirements 
rather they speak of importing food to add to domestic 
supplies while exporting agricultural goods as an offset he 
said for example a romanian official has said that his country 
eventually should export surpluses of wheat and wine while 
importing enough animal feedstuffs to cover domestic demand for 
livestock products 
but in the near term lambert said it is unlikely agriculture 
in eastern europe will make great strides 
poland and romania which are two of the most populous east 
european countries 38 million and 23 million people 
respectively could face several years of serious shortages he 
said 
consequently us foodaid programs may be used to make 
agricultural commodities available to those countries lambert said

dams and other projects built since the 
mid1950s under the federal small watershed program have helped 
ease the damage from floods this spring in southcentral areas the 
national association of conservation districts reports 
in oklahoma where nearly onethird of the small watershed 
structures are located soil conservation service officials 
estimated that more than 6 million in damages was avoided 
more than 600 small watershed dams were built in the 
southeastern and southcentral parts of oklahoma the association 
said in its latest newsletter 
the dams were designed to catch flood water and slowly release 
it over 10 to 20 days more than 16 billion gallons of water were 
held by the dams during the heavy rains of april and may 
this is water that would have been in the streams and rivers 
if not for the dams and would have increased the flooding 
considerably said budd fountain oklahoma state conservationist 
conservation structures also performed admirably during the 
recent flooding in northcentral texas said wes oneth

exports in 1989 accounted for more than 18 
percent of the value of us farm production the highest rating in 
five years the agriculture department reports 
the farm value of exports in calendar 1989 was 318 billion 
the departments economic research service said thursday gross 
cash income of farmers was 174 billion 
that meant the farm value of exports was 183 percent of last 
years gross income the largest share since 1984 when the farm 
export value was 304 billion and the gross was 1553 billion a 
share of 196 percent 
the indicator dropped after peaking at 24 percent in the early

twentythree romanian tourists fearing a new 
dictatorship in their country have asked france for political 
asylum authorities said 
a group of 80 romanians entered france as tourists on june 8 
local officials said thursday but when the time came to leave last 
sunday 58 were missing 
of those 58 23 have since asked for political asylum and 
police said they are looking for the others 
eight other romanians apart from the group of 80 have asked 
for asylum in recent days 
they fear that the government of their country is heading 
toward a new dictatorship said one local official 
no decision has been made by regional authorities on what to do 
with the romanians until their cases are decided by the 
governments office for the protection of refugees and exiles 
charity groups are now housing them 
in bucharest health ministry officials said thursday that at 
least five people were killed and 350 injured in two days of 
violence between supporters and opponents of the governing national 
salvation front 
the front largely composed of former communists spearheaded 
the december revolution that toppled former dictator nicolae 
ceausescu it won a landslide victory in national elections last 
month but protesters say it is guilty of many of the abuses of the 
ceausescu era

the postal service is weighing changes in how 
it gets mail to nursing home residents who have moved and to the 
homeless 
the agency has come under fire for refusing to forward nursing 
home residents mail automatically when they move elderlyrights 
advocates say the policy treats residents like prison inmates by 
placing the burden on the home to forward mail 
the postal service will reconsider its practice as part of a 
broad review spokesman lou eberhardt said thursday 
the review is not a cursory glance eberhardt said they 
are going to assemble various sections of the postal service 
delivery marketing mail processing and sit down beginning next 
week 
the purpose eberhardt said is to determine whether changes 
should be made not only from a standpoint of the nursing home 
portion but mail for homeless mail being handled by agents its 
hard to say exactly where its going but it may require some 
procedural changes where nursing homes are concerned 
since residents of a nursing home are at the same address the 
postal service says the home should be the agent of their mail 
the mail is delivered in bulk like at a prison and then 
distributed 
while other people may submit changeofaddress cards to the 
local post office nursing home residents must rely on the 
institution to write their new address on individual letters once 
the mail is readdressed the post office delivers it at no extra 
charge 
allowing automatic forwarding is not practical 
operationally the postal service says since mail for individual 
residents is not sorted at the post office the agency says it 
could not easily distinguish mail that needs to be forwarded from 
the rest 
its absurd sen john heinz rpa said in an interview 
thursday the postal service says we can only deliver in bulk 
but people are paying for firstclass postage on that mail 
the agency review will include other possible problem areas 
there are a lot of people getting mail who are homeless 
eberhardt said he said most get their mail through general 
delivery boxes and the postal service wanted to see if the system 
is working 
heinz wrote the agency in march questioning whether nursing home 
residents should be classified with inmates who have lost 
important civil rights or with shortterm hospital patients he 
said he has received no response 
heinz acted after a pennsylvania ombudsman for the elderly 
complained of problems created when a nursing home was shut down by 
the state last year and the owner was not around to forward the 
mail a local agency ended up getting the letters to 30 displaced 
residents 
also lobbying is sister mary gregoria rush of the roman catholic 
diocese of st petersburg fla she wrote the agency lawmakers and 
first lady barbara bush seeking to change this policy that treats 
nursing home residents like they were in jail or something

the government says it will ask an appeals court 
to throw out the convictions of seven people who served prison 
sentences for allegedly running an ira bomb factory 
the announcement marked the collapse of all the convictions 
stemming from two irish republican army bombings of pubs in 
guildford and woolwich in 1974 in which seven people died 
i dont believe the convictions can be allowed to stand 
home secretary david waddington told the house of commons thursday 
hours earlier englands senior prosecutor told a judicial 
inquiry that the convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory 
because of questions about the reliability of scientific tests 
which were the core of the prosecution case 
four people convicted of the bombings were released in october 
after the director of public prosecutions said police had lied 
about some evidence 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule of 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite the province with 
ireland 
six of those convicted in the bomb factory case have served 
their sentences and the seventh guiseppe conlon died in prison in 
1980 
i only hope and pray now that it will go as soon as possible 
to the appeals court to take the burden off our family because it 
has been a living nightmare said anne maguire who served 10 
years in prison her husband two sons two relatives and a family 
friend were also convicted 
waddington said he would not refer the case to the court of 
appeal until the judicial inquiry headed by sir john may 
completes its work 
the governments case was based on forensic evidence indicating 
that all seven had traces of nitroglycerin on their hands 
allan green the director of public prosecutions said he 
considered the convictions unsatisfactory because recent tests had 
shown that the defendants might have been contaminated by touching 
something such as a towel that had been touched by someone else 
who had handled explosives 
testimony at the inquiry revealed that the tests were done by an 
18yearold junior technician and the results could not be 
verified because all the samples were used up 
the scientific evidence given to the jury may have misled them 
into excluding the possibility of innocent contamination green 
said 
mrs maguire was convicted in 1976 along with her husband 
patrick their sons vincent and patrick guiseppe conlon patrick 
maguire brotherinlaw sean john smyth mrs maguires brother 
and a family friend patrick joseph oneill 
earlier this year waddington ordered an investigation into the 
convictions of six men for pub bombings that killed 21 people in 
birmingham in november 1974 that investigation continues 
in the house of commons on thursday waddington faced calls from 
labor party legislators for a full public inquiry into the 
birmingham case 
i will consider carefully what the may inquiry says about the 
forensic evidence in the maguire case i will take fully into 
account any implications it might have for the safety of other 
convictions waddington said 
in an interview with press association britains domestic news 
agency mrs maguire said she was not bitter about the convictions 
just very very hurt that this could happen in my childrens 
country

the nations mayors much like the white house 
and congress arent quite sure how big of a peace dividend will 
result from planned cuts in defense spending 
but they want half whatever the amount 
the mayors open their annual summer meeting here today poised to 
demand that much of the defense savings be funneled to cities to 
help ease education drug and housing problems they increasingly 
blame on the white house and congress 
the federal government has walked away from the cities of 
america and now we are beginning to see the dangerous results 
said boston mayor raymond flynn a leading spokesman for the mayors 
there are signs that cannot be ignored even through the best 
set of rosecolored glasses flynn said 
he listed among his examples gang violence in his and several 
other cities and recent tensions in new york resulting from court 
proceedings against whites accused of participating in a mob attack 
last summer that left a black teenager dead 
this isnt a republican or a democratic problem alone or a 
bigcity problem alone or a liberal or conservative mayors problem 
alone flynn said this is an american problem that is gnawing 
at the social conscience of the american public 
flynn this year moves up to the vice presidency of the us 
conference of mayors which is dominated by bigcity democratic 
mayors who are frequent critics of the republican bush 
administration but even the organizations republicans are voicing 
rising frustration with white house priorities 
we have considerable mandates placed upon us by the federal 
government with less and less funding to carry them out said 
republican mayor robert isaac of colorado springs colo who takes 
over as president of the conference we are not asking for a 
handouts we are asking for fairness 
the mayors will debate dozens of policy statements on an array 
of issues with a clear consensus in advance of the meeting in 
favor of a proposal to demand that cities get half of any peace 
dividend 
but after a decade of cuts in federal aid to cities few mayors 
are optimistic their demand will be met 
im not so naive as to believe the white house and the 
congress are going to listen to us mayors flynn said in an 
interview thursday what we as an organization have to do is 
generate political support american cities are in deep trouble 
the mayors also will consider adopting dozens of policy 
statements on health care housing and other issues many similar 
to stances taken at past meetings another asks the federal 
government not to hurt local real estate markets by selling at 
bargainbasement prices properties it controls because of savings 
and loan failures 
isaac whose area has been hard hit by sampl failures also is 
lobbying to get the federal government to surrender some of the 
properties to local governments for affordablehousing programs 
money for housing programs has been drying up the colorado 
springs mayor said i see this as a tremendous opportunity to do 
some good 
the sixday meeting opens today with the first joint meeting of 
organization task forces on drug control and homelessness 
at a meeting last week to plan the conference several mayors 
said street tensions in their cities appeared to be on the rise 
heading into the summer months 
this isnt a time for happy talk said flynn a decade of 
neglect of americas cities has created an abominable mix that 
presents a dangerously tense situation for this summer and years to 
come

the air force looking to bolster support for 
the b2 bomber is willing to delay modernization of its two 
landbased nuclear missiles to develop the stealth aircraft 
president bushs nominee for air force chief of staff gen 
michael j dugan said publicly thursday what has been hinted for 
weeks the service has proposed to defense secretary dick cheney 
that work on the missiles be delayed 
when asked if the air force had recommended that option dugan 
told the senate armed services committee 
i understand that i accept that approve that and i support 
that one needs to look at affordability issues in every regard 
cheney must decide whether to slow down development of the 
singlewarhead midgetman missile and delay plans to move the 
multiplewarhead mx missile from fixed silos to railroad cars 
in april the defense secretary said the bush administration 
supports the mx railgarrison program which totals 28 billion in 
the defense budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the budget 
also calls for 202 million for the midgetman 
this is a proposal it hasnt been reviewed its subject to 
lots of further discussion dugan said 
the commander of the air force in europe said he supports the 
proposal and indicated that his no 1 concern is the b2 stealth 
bomber the radarevading plane that at more than 815 million a 
copy has resulted in increasing congressional opposition 
i rank the b2 at the head of my list for all strategic 
modernization programs in the air force dugan said 
his second priority is the midgetman missile and third is the mx 
missile on railroad cars which the service should have as a hedge 
with research and development funds available he said 
i find a logic to that set of priorities said committee 
chairman sam nunn dga 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
committee concurred 
in an interview with defense news the outgoing chief of staff 
gen larry welch said the united states ought to pause 
intercontinental ballistic missile modernization until we have a 
clear view of where were going to go in the next step of arms 
control 
nunn indicated that dugan and adm frank b kelso bushs choice 
for chief of naval operations who also testified before the panel 
would win swift committee approval

defense secretary dick cheney in anticipation 
of pentagon budget cuts is freezing military construction for 
another five months and will ask congress to cancel a large number 
of construction projects his spokesman says 
next week cheney is expected to send congress a list of 
military construction projects that he would like to see 
eliminated pentagon spokesman pete williams said thursday 
cheneys move comes as congress has been pressing for sharp 
reductions in pentagon spending and reductions in the nations 
military forces 
his request is expected to cause some controversy on capitol 
hill 
decisions to halt construction projects are seen by some as an 
attack on pork barrel padding of the defense budget but it also 
fuels the debate between those who want to cut pentagon spending 
and lawmakers who want to protect local jobs 
the secretary decided to extend a worldwide freeze on military 
construction in order to help ensure the department proceeds with 
the projects for which there is a genuine need williams said 
cheney will select his candidates for cancellation from a list 
of some 207 projects including the controversial navy home 
ports in texas alabama mississippi and new york 
last month cheney ordered the 207 projects to be reviewed for 
possible cancellation 
because funds for the projects already have been approved the 
secretary must ask congress to withdraw the funding through a 
process known formally as rescission 
williams said he could not say exactly how many of the 207 
projects might be cancelled but added it is fair to say that 
the secretary believes that funding should be cancelled on a 
substantial number of military construction projects 
i would expect a decision on this next week williams said 
the freeze which will run through nov 15 affects more than 7 
billion in construction 
the 207 specific projects under study for cancellation have been 
valued by the pentagon at 12 billion 
cheney first put a freeze on construction in january and 
extended it in april it was due to expire on june 15 
the 207 sites under study included the socalled strategic home 
ports in ingleside texas mobile ala pascagoula miss and 
staten island ny 
the majority of the 207 projects under review were located 
overseas in particular in west germany planned improvements or 
construction of hangars maintenance facilities family housing 
projects schools for military dependents and medical units were 
among the items targeted 
however some of the domestic sites targeted carried hefty price 
tags 
besides the four ports the review also included a 110 million 
project at a rocket test facility at arnold tenn 60 million in 
improvements at fort hood and red river army depot in texas and a 
37 million project at a consolidated maintenance facility at 
tooele utah

president bush is giving a white house 
sendoff to 122 english teachers who are bringing the peace corps 
to poland and hungary for the first time 
the volunteers in washington for their final orientation were 
selected from the thousands of americans who answered bushs call 
earlier this year for the peace corps to help the two east european 
nations fill the vacuum created by the collapse of communist rule 
its almost as if the peace corps had been in training for 30 
years for this moment paul d coverdell the peace corps 
director said 
today they will hear from bush in a rose garden ceremony 
coverdell said the effort to create an englishlanguage teaching 
network in poland and hungary may open a good solid decade of 
activity with expansion possible into the fields of environmental 
protection and business development 
after four decades of communism in eastern europe the first 
peace corps volunteers in poland and hungary are truly pioneers 
coverdell said 
its a new relationship he said anytime you are the 
first theres pressure because everybodys eyes are on you 
coverdell said the peace corps is aware of how different the 
task in eastern europe will be compared to the developing countries 
of the third world where education is substandard 
in hungary and poland peace corps volunteers will be dealing 
with a welleducated constituency that is dramatically 
underresourced he said 
one of the challenges he said is that they will be head to 
head with an enlightened people they will be sitting across the 
table from someone who is clearly a match 
the volunteers ranging in age from 21 to 77 come from 31 
states coast to coast 
felix lapinski 66 a former official of the agency for 
international development and of polish descent said he is looking 
forward to his assignment to help poles master english a language 
he says has become the access language of the modern era 
coverdell says english is vital as eastern europe turns to face 
the west because it has become the language of commerce science 
mathematics and computer technology 
in the very very recent past english was a closet language 
in eastern europe you had to learn it secretly says jerry 
welch the peace corps deputy director for central europe and 
other regions 
welch noted that lessons in russian once a requirement now 
have been all but abandoned 
now they have a need for a large number of english teachers 
welch told volunteers 
i think you will not find that you are any kind of threat to 
existing english teachers he assured them they are few in 
number and overwhelmed 
coverdell says that far from draining the resources of the peace 
corps the opening to eastern europe has struck the popular 
imagination and sparked as much interest in the idealistic 
organization as at any time since it was launched 30 years ago by 
president kennedy 
he noted that almost 30 countries around the globe have 
indicated interest recently in peace corps programs 
the peace corps is now widely understood coverdell said 
i think it was a great idea and i think it has proved itself i 
think it has won over virtually all of its original skeptics

the band 2 live crew proved thursday night it 
could perform without breaking any laws and even the police chief 
admitted he liked the rap concert 
i consider it the pg version gwinnett county police chief 
wayne bolden said this is the first rap concert ive been to and 
im kind of enjoying it i like the beat 
the band whose xrated lyrics got its star arrested in florida 
performed about 40 minutes at a teen nightclub before an estimated 
320 people including three police officers 
the band had canceled an 8 pm concert and a promoter blamed 
the decision on all the hype about the groups problems with 
the law 
they had a fear that they would be arrested whether they did 
the clean show or an adult version said promoter chris lyons of 
salt and pepper entertainment 
lyons said the band missed its morning flight from miami as it 
sought assurances there would be no arrests if they kept their show 
in this atlanta suburb clean 
the band did not arrive from the atlanta airport until after 11 
pm delaying the 1030 pm show about an hour 
bolden said he met with band members when they arrived and 
told them about the obscenity law i also told them they could 
not play any songs from the album as nasty as they wanna be 
he said band members thanked him for the explanation 
bolden had threatened to arrest the rappers if they performed 
any songs from the sexually explicit but popular album 
lyons said all the hype about the show was that they would do 
an xrated show at a teen venue 
among those waiting outside the nightclub in anticipation of the 
concert that was cancelled were eight people protesting attempts to 
squelch 2 live crews music which features explicit lyrics they 
carried signs reading does anyone remember the bill of rights 
and a bad rap for the first amendment 
i dont like the music but i still see it as a first

house democrats are pressing an independent 
counsel to widen his probe to include allegations that former 
housing secretary samuel r pierce jr lied to congress 
the lawmakers wrote to attorney general dick thornburgh on 
thursday asking him to refer the allegations against pierce to the 
independent counsel appointed after revelations of scandals at the 
department of housing and urban development 
the letter signed by all 22 democrats on the house judiciary 
committee cited testimony last month by former assistant hud 
secretary dubois l gilliam as new evidence suggesting that pierce 
lied when he was questioned last year by congress about the hud 
scandals 
gilliam who is serving an 18month prison term for conspiracy 
and accepting an illegal gratuity testified that pierce ordered 
him several times to make grant awards to developers with 
republican political connections 
in testimony last year to the house government operations 
employment and housing subcommittee pierce insisted he did not 
have hands on involvement in disbursing money through the 
moderate rehabilitation program saying that he never told these 
people to fund anything 
in their letter to thornburgh the 22 democrats said gilliam 
described at least two instances in which mr pierce was directly 
involved in abuses of the moderate rehabilitation program 
the letter said gilliam may have contradicted mr pierces 
earlier testimony citing gilliams statements that the former 
cabinet secretary was the big dealer in hud grants 
gilliam told the panel last month that pierce used the hud 
secretarys discretionary grant program as a private political 
slush fund 
after reviewing gilliams testimony thornburgh asked 
independent counsel arlin m adams to broaden his investigation to 
include allegations of political favoritism in the operation of the 
discretionary grant fund and the urban development action grant 
program 
adams was originally appointed to investigate whether pierce and 
former top aides showed political favoritism in the operation of 
the moderate rehabilitation program 
the independent counsel is taking steps to widen his 
investigation and has granted immunity to gilliam according to a 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity adams has also issued 
grand jury subpoenas to pierce and his former associates sources 
said 
thornburgh sought appointment of the hud independent counsel 
after reviewing allegations turned over to the justice department 
by judiciary committee democrats 
but the attorney general rejected the lawmakers request that 
the investigation include allegations of perjury against pierce 
thornburgh said at the time that the questions pierce was asked 
and the answers he gave were so ambiguous that they did not provide 
any evidence of perjury 
robert plotkin one of pierces defense attorneys said 
gilliams testimony does not change thornburghs earlier conclusion 
that there was no specific and credible allegation of perjury 
that warranted further investigation 
gilliam was never asked directly about anything that pierce 
testified about that was of a specific enough nature for him to be 
able to contradict anything plotkin said 
but rep charles schumer dny one of the signers of the 
letter said gilliam has added new cause to look into perjury 
gilliams testimony both takes the potential perjury into new 
areas as well makes the case stronger schumer said i think it 
merits a serious look by the independent counsel let the 
independent counsel determine matters of the depth of the 
evidence

ambitious usjapanese trade talks are 
stalled with american officials threatening not to sign a landmark 
agreement if the japanese fail to open further their markets to 
us goods 
the ongoing dispute flared into the open thursday when bush 
administration officials charged that japan was failing to honor 
commitments made in april to attack the root causes of americas 
49 billion trade deficit with japan 
in april both countries signed an interim agreement pledging to 
make fundamental economic reforms to reduce the huge trade 
imbalance between the two economic superpowers 
in the agreement known as the structural impediments 
initiative japan pledged to boost its public works spending and 
move toward breaking up the cozy relationships between japanese 
firms that keep foreign companies from doing business in japans 
market 
the united states pledged to intensify efforts to reduce the 
federal budget deficit improve its education system and boost its 
low savings rate 
the interim report was due to be followed in early july with a 
final report fleshing out the broad commitments and setting up a 
monitoring arrangement to insure compliance 
however talks on the final report have made little progress 
with the us side pushing for specifics to back up the japanese 
promises and the japanese insisting they have gone as far as they 
can go 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
thursday the administration intended to keep the pressure on to 
ensure that all the commitments make it through to the final 
report 
a senior administration official briefing reporters on 
background was even more blunt warning that the united states 
might refuse to sign a final report unless the japanese are more 
forthcoming 
it would be highly regrettable that if at this stage this 
process lost momentum and reversed itself the official said he 
charged that top japanese officials have failed to provide 
sufficient guidance to their negotiators 
secretary of state james a baker iii is scheduled to meet 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama in san francisco on friday 
the administration is hoping those discussions will get the trade 
talks back on track 
the next round of talks on structural barriers is scheduled for 
june 2526 in tokyo with the final report due before the houston 
economic summit meeting on july 9 
if not cleared up before then a trade fight between the united 
states and japan would threaten the upbeat mood at this years 
economic meeting of the worlds seven richest industrial countries 
officials briefing reporters thursday said key sticking points 
in the current negotiations revolve around how much more japan will 
spend on public works projects and how it will toughen its 
antitrust penalties 
the administration is also bothered by the japanese insistence 
that they do not need to reduce their huge trade surplus because 
the excess money is needed to supply capital for the reconstruction 
of eastern europe the unification of germany and debtstrapped 
nations in latin america 
the administration says the new position is a negotiating ploy 
that fails to take into account other ways to raise needed 
investment capital besides running huge trade surpluses that 
destabilize the global economy 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher testifying before the 
senate banking committee on thursday said he hoped the japanese 
were not trying to stonewall american negotiators to test the 
administrations resolve 
they did take some very good first steps but they have got a 
lot farther to go as we do he said

rising wholesale cocaine prices show antidrug 
efforts are starting to pay off and causing shortages 
national drug director william j bennett says 
it looks as if we are beginning to have a positive effect on 
the flow of cocaine into this country bennett said thursday 
this can change this can bump up and down as time goes on but 
it looks like some real impact is occurring 
were putting some tremendous pressure on drug traffickers and 
i think its starting to pay off he said crediting colombias 
crackdown on the cocaine cartels and interdiction and investigative 
efforts by us agencies 
but bennett warned no one should be lulled into thinking that 
this is the end 
drug traffickers thwarted in efforts to bring cocaine into the 
united states will now try to divert do other things try to 
get more in other ways he said weve got to be ready for them 
at the next place 
the drug enforcement administration disagreed with bennetts 
conclusion that increases in wholesale cocaine prices in los 
angeles and new york city reflect a shortage in cocaine 
the story is that we are very very cautiously optimistic that 
the changes in price that we are seeing in some markets reflect 
tremendously successful law enforcement efforts said dea 
spokesman frank shults 
however he added we are not saying the united states has 
experienced any cocaine shortage and there is absolutely no 
indication of a nationwide trend 
the good news shults said is that the dea has found that a 
kilogram of cocaine today in new york city can fetch as much as 
35000 at the wholesale level up from official estimates last 
fall of 14000 to 18000 
in los angeles wholesale prices have risen from 10000 per 
kilogram in lots of 10 or more and 15000 for smaller amounts last 
fall to 25000 today shults said one recent case there involved a 
price of 35000 
in undercover operations were finding people saying ill 
pay any price he said 
the wholesale price of cocaine also has gone up in boston but 
it has stayed about the same in miami and it has gone both up and 
down in phoenix where a kilogram still can be bought for a 
bargain 11000 shults said 
traffickers in new york also have been making deals for 
halfkilo amounts of cocaine when they used to trade only in lots 
of 10 kilograms or more he said 
in addition when agents seized a large shipment of cocaine in 
baltimore recently it was not pure but already had been diluted 
which the dea saw as a very very good sign he said 
we believe very strongly that the enforcement activities of 
the united states of the andean nations of colombia peru and 
bolivia have had the effect of disrupting the major cocaine 
cartels shults said 
but he acknowledged the possibility that entrepreneurs are 
simply demanding more for their goods scaring buyers into thinking 
there are shortages 
there could be gouging he said there could be 
stockpiling there could be a shortage 
bennett said a cocaine shortage could trigger increased 
violence even though he has long cited the violence that 
accompanies drug trafficking as a reason to eliminate the drugs 
weve got a long summer ahead of us and in some of our 
communities where there is a shortage of cocaine there will be 
violence as a result of that he said there will be the same 
number of dogs fighting over a smaller number of bones and we can 
anticipate some of that this summer

people who knew joe t meador say they 
cant believe the quiet hardware store owner stole millions in 
medieval art from a german church while he was a soldier during 
world war ii 
the possibility that meador stashed the precious cache in a 
whitewright bank vault was the talk of this farm town thursday 
when the new york times quoted unidentified sources as saying he 
was responsible for one of the centurys biggest art thefts 
i just dont believe he was that kind of a man said 
73yearold mary bryant who said she had visited meadors home but 
could not remember seeing any sumptuous works of art 
he didnt seem the type of guy to me that would do something 
like that said troyce spencer who also lives in this town of 
1760 people about 60 miles north of dallas 
the newspaper said meador in the final days of world war ii 
took the objects from a church in quedlinburg an ancient castle 
town in what is now east germany the times based its report on 
interviews with art experts lawyers and neighbors of meador 
stolen was a small silver display case inlaid with enamels and 
precious stones with side panels of carved ivory a liturgical 
ivory comb a manuscript dated 1513 several rock crystal flasks 
and gold and silver crucifixes and other treasures 
the army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949 
when quedlinburg became part of east germany 
dietrich kotzsche a german authority in medieval decorative 
art said the quedlinburg treasures dating to the 9th and 10th 
centuries could be worth millions 
the times reported today that the church in quedlinburg has 
retained two lawyers to seek the return of the art 
meador died in 1980 at age 64 he coowned a family hardware and 
farm tool business and grew orchids in a greenhouse behind the 
twostory victorian home he shared with his mother mabel 
he was the type of fellow that didnt mix with people much 
said odell caraway a member of american legion post 225 to which 
meador once belonged as far as i know hes never been involved 
in any kind of crooked stuff 
willi a korte a west german government official who 
specializes in the repatriation of cultural property and thomas r 
kline of the law firm andrews amp kurth of washington and dallas 
said they planned a trip to dallas today to negotiate with meadors 
relatives the times said 
neither those lawyers nor john s torigian an attorney for 
meadors brother jack could be reached for comment thursday by 
the associated press 
meador was an officer in the 87th armored field artillery which 
occupied quedlinburg and guarded a mine shaft where the times said 
the treasures were kept the items disappeared a few days after 
us troops took over the area in 1945 the newspaper said 
three longtime meador employees said thursday they had never 
known their boss to show off any art works 
the times reported that a source it did not identify said the 
treasures are in the vault of the first national bank of 
whitewright reportedly as collateral for a loan harrell stowers 
the banks executive vice president would not confirm that 
information thursday when asked by the associated press 
jack meador his wife jean and meadors sister jane meador 
cook also would not comment thursday 
how the treasures got to texas is a secret that may have died 
with meador 
most of the people interviewed thursday said they didnt know 
meador had even been in the army or world war ii 
we havent had this much excitement since the machine gun 
deal said mayor clarence tillet jr who explained that a judge 
once charged four machine guns in the towns name to avoid paying 
sales tax

orange guppy males can wind up either as a 
favorite of females or as dinner according to a study published 
today in the journal science 
female guppies with the mating urge like finned suitors with 
flashy bright patches of orange 
unfortunately predators also favor the guys with the big bold 
colors 
princeton university researcher anne e houde said female 
guppies do indeed seem to prefer males that have overall brighter 
colors such as how much orange they have in their patterns 
but that also is a combination that attracts big fish birds and 
other predators 
houde and john a endler of the university of california santa 
barbara researched the color preferences of guppy love by taking 
fish from six different locations in trinidad a tropical island 
where the vividness of guppy colors varies from stream to stream 
they found that when a female guppy showed a preference in her 
mate selection she went for the guys with those dazzling orange 
colors 
but not all female guppies made their selections on such 
superficial criteria houde said for females from streams where 
most males were dull hues she said color didnt seem to be a 
factor 
and how do you tell when guppies get romantic 
male guppies houde said swim to a female and make a courtship 
display like a little dance 
if she is interested then she will start gliding toward him 
and there will be a mating houde said if shes not 
interested she will seem to pay no attention whatsoever she has 
to have that initial response or there is no mating 
females also have a roving eye and may mate with two or three 
male guppies 
unlike most fish guppy eggs are fertilized and hatched 
internally the females give birth after three weeks broods 
average 10 to 15 
houde said that by studying mating choices among the guppies 
scientists hope to learn more about the forces that shape evolution 
species colors may also be affected by choices made by 
predators and predators she said tend to eat brightly colored 
guppies more often than the duller ones 
for whatever reason that females have preference for 
particular males then that is an evolutionary force she said 
and for whatever reason the males are subject to predators 
thats an evolution force 
houde said female guppies may choose orange mates because that 
is color of health in the guppy world 
females are able to identify males who are healthy and 
resistant to parasites because they can put on a good show of 
orange she said infected or diseased males have duller colors 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

owners of huge farms in the west who have 
gotten rich by using water subsidized by the federal government 
will have to pay full price if legislation approved by the house 
becomes law 
the price tag for some producers would be in the millions of 
dollars but the bills author rep george miller dcalif said 
it will stop the raid on the federal treasury 
this was about excesses miller said thursday after the 
house passed his bill this was about people who pushed the 
congress too far looking for special treatment 
the federal government has been building dams in the west since 
the early part of the century to supply water for farming 
miller attached his amendment to a water projects bill that 
authorized spending for modifications to the buffalo bill dam and 
reservoir in wyoming 
basically it strengthens the reclamation reform act of 1982 by 
defining farm and farm operation in greater detail for 
determining eligibility for cheap water 
the original legislation said subsidized water could go to farms 
no larger than 960 acres however it left a loophole that allowed 
corporations to reorganize their property into smaller entities and 
continue to get cheap water without actually breaking apart their 
businesses 
a farm owner named repeatedly during debate was the jg boswell 
co one of the largest agricultural producers in the nation the 
corporation runs a 23000acre farm in californias central valley 
but it continued to get subsidized water legally by reorganizing 
into an employeeowned company 
under the house bill boswell and others who have formed 
partnerships that send profits to a main office would have to pay 
full price for water 
these arent separate farmers said miller these are a 
scheme to continue the flow of federal taxpayer dollars to the 
land these are a scheme to start farming the treasury as opposed 
to farming the land 
he said 98 percent of the farmers in the program are in 
compliance with congress intent in the law he said the others 
were only a handful of people 
but theyre very powerful people he said theyre very 
big in the political contribution business theyre very big at 
fundraisers theyre very big in party politics 
millers amendment passed the house by a 31697 vote another 
amendment offered by rep sam gejdenson dconn and approved 
33855 would phase out irrigation subsidies used on crops that are 
subsidized under agriculture programs 
similar legislation is pending in the senate 
rep charles pashayan jr rcalif who opposed the bill said 
it would harm small farmers 
its result will be to discourage production of that very thing 
at which americans are the very best at in the world namely food 
and fiber he said

a financial wizard who tumbled from the top of a 
savings and loan empire in just a few years says the government has 
made him a scapegoat for the nations thrift troubles 
donald dixon said he will plead innocent to 38 counts of a 
federal indictment which alleges conspiracy fraud and furthering 
racketeering 
for the moment the us government is making a scapegoat of 
me because theyre unaccountable for their role in the 500 billion 
or greater loss the american taxpayer has to pay he said 
thursday shortly after he was freed on a personal recognizance 
bond by us magistrate john b tolle 
dixon who had surrendered to the fbi was forced by federal 
regulators in 1986 to relinquish control of vernon savings and loan 
association where seven former officers and employees have been 
convicted of bank fraud charges dixon owned the thrift 
prosecutors say dixon who lived a life of luxury and hobnobbed 
with the powerful was an example along with his thrift of the 
abuses that led sampls into disaster 
the dixon case is an effort to bring to justice people who 
break the law who use savings and loan associations as personal 
piggy banks and who may have thought they could just walk away free 
and let the american taxpayer shoulder the cost of their greed 
said timothy ryan director of the office of thrift supervision in 
washington 
dixon is accused of using thousands of dollars from vernon 
savings on pleasure trips prostitutes and illegal contributions to 
politicians including former house speaker jim wright and jack 
kemp a former republican congressman from new york who is now 
secretary of housing and urban development and sens jake garn 
rutah and alan cranston dcalif 
dixon flew on corporate jets relaxed on a corporate yacht and 
enjoyed a salary and benefits running into the millions with the 
thrifts money government attorneys said 
dixon had a california beach house rolls royces and an art 
collection he bought his wife 110 bottles of perfume and traveled 
to the spas and restaurants of europe 
in his home town dixon bought tiny vernon savings in 1982 after 
success heading two homebuilding and development companies dondi 
homes and raldon homes 
vernon savings in less than four years under dixons lead grew 
by a staggering 1600 percent even though sampls are prohibited from 
growing more than 25 percent per year it became one of the top 20 
texas thrifts with 16 billion in deposits 
after moving vernons headquarters to dallas dixon offered high 
rates that attracted depositors from across the country the 
deposits were guaranteed for up to 100000 by the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp and millions of dollars flew in 
vernon went on a lending binge with deposits as new rules 
allowed sampls into commercial developments loans also were allowed 
on projects with little capital behind them and no down payments 
court documents show vernon officers developed an efficient way 
to create as much loanfee income as possible and paid little 
attention to traditional lending practices 
the thrifts executives fudged their required filings with 
regulators to make it look healthier the government said at the 
end of 1986 vernon savings reported a positive net worth of 17 
million which regulators say was actually a negative 350 million 
ninetysix percent of the thrifts loans were overdue 
in 1986 federal regulators forced out dixon the next year he 
and other vernon officials were sued by regulators trying to 
recover the thrifts losses and dixon filed for personal 
bankruptcy that case is pending 
the charges against dixon carry a maximum penalty of 190 years 
in prison and a 95 million fine

fundamentalist islamic salvation front to an unexpected election 
victory this week has formed the countrys most potent political 
force in less than 17 months 
sheikh abassi madani serves as president of the partys 14man 
governing council almost always clad in white he can be

million sympathizers many drawn from the ranks of unemployed youth 
with limited economic prospects 
madani 59 and his party want to revolutionize algerian 
society turning the clock back from the failed oneparty socialist 
model the ruling party tried to impose for 28 years tuesdays 
election marked the first free vote since independence from france 
in 1962 
the fundamentalists want to make algeria an islamic republic and 
impose religious law the sharia that would strip women of most of

basic cable television rates climbed at twice 
the rate of inflation last year according to a report that 
refueled the drive in congress to reregulate subscriber charges 
the prices for the lowestcost basic service and most popular 
cable services in 1989 increased an average of 10 percent from 
1450 to 1595 the congressional general accounting office said 
the total average cable bill went up 5 percent from 25 to 2636 
the inflation rate was 4 percent to 5 percent rate for the year 
said gao the investigative arm of congress 
gao reported last year that basic cable rates increased 29 
percent from december 1986 to october 1988 
rep edward j markey dmass who requested the gao survey 
said the results showed that congress must consider legislation 
that will rein in the renegade operators in the cable industry 
he said the report should erase any lingering doubts on the 
need to move forward with legislation that enhances competition 
and ensures reasonable rates 
the house energy and commerce telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee which markey chairs is expected to approve a cable 
regulation bill later this month a senate subcommittee approved 
its own bill last week calling for more competition for cable and 
renewed rate regulation of mostly basic overtheair broadcast 
channels 
the national cable television association said the gao report 
reconfirms that the average cable subscribers monthly bill 
increased at about the rate of inflation in 1989 and is still 
further evidence that cable rate increases have leveled off it 
said cable is still a very good buy 
but gene kimmelman legislative director of the consumer 
federation of america said the leveling off if any was being 
achieved by cable operators lowering the costs of premium services 
such as hbo and showtime while raising basic rates 
but you have to have basic to get premium kimmelman said 
thats where theyve got you over a barrel 
between nov 30 1986 and dec 31 1989 rates for the 
lowestpriced and most popular service increased by 43 percent 
from an average 1114 to 1595 per subscriber gao said 
average total cable bills went up 21 percent from 2178 to 
2636 during that period 
about 20 percent of the subscribers to either the most popular 
or lowest priced service experienced price increases in the three 
years greater than 60 percent gao said from 1984 through 1989 
the average increase was 65 percent 
during 1989 the number of channels available to cable 
subscribers increased by one or two on average since the cable 
industry was deregulated in november 1986 the average number of 
basic channels available has risen from 24 to 31 channels 
gao said cable systems that were regulated in november 1986 had 
greater increases through last december than the 24 percent of the 
nations cable tv systems that were not regulated in november 1986 
the gao based its results on questionnaires returned from 1530 
of the nations approximately 9000 cable systems

a lawyer is asking the senate ethics committee 
to investigate sen paul simons hiring practices but a 
spokeswoman for the illinois democrat says the request is a 
partisan ruse 
in his 13page complaint john j curry jr of chicago says 
several employees were hired in simons senate office and given 
campaign duties while he ran for president in 198788 
once his bid for the democratic nomination ended so did the 
senate jobs curry says 
he also says some of simons top senate aides were given 
significant campaign roles but never lost their public salaries and 
in some cases received raises 
the attorney said his allegations are based on senate and 
federal election records he lists names dates and amounts of 
money 
curry filed a separate complaint with the federal election 
commission alleging an improper relationship between simons 
presidential campaign and a political action committee the senator 
once headed called the democracy fund 
ellen golin spokeswoman for simons senate reelection 
campaign called the ethics committee complaint part of the 
republican dirty tricks strategy 
she said the committee gave simon a copy of the complaint in 
late may and he is preparing a response 
there are in excess of 100 erroneous allegations there 
golin said thursday this lawyer didnt have concern for the 
facts 
in an interview curry acknowledged being a republican but said 
his decision to file the complaint was not part of an organized 
republican effort to discredit simon he said he decided to study 
the documents after hearing allegations from others 
currys complaint dated april 11 says sen simon directly 
or indirectly allowed his official senate allowances and staff to 
be used to supplement the limited financial resources available 
to his presidential campaign 
it appears the complaint says that sen simon acted 
negligently with respect to his obligation as a senator to observe 
the strictures of both federal law and the standing rules of the 
senate 
the ethics committees chief attorney wilson abney would not 
comment on the complaint 
curry released a letter from abney that shows the committee 
received the complaint 
besides payroll allegations the complaint says at least five of 
simons senate employees lent money or services to his presidential 
campaign it also questions whether some senatefinanced plane 
trips taken by simon and his staff were actually related to his 
campaign

some nonfarm area lawmakers are ready to 
pounce on the 1990 farm bill approved by the house agriculture 
committee because they oppose paying subsidies to farmers who 
already make a decent living 
but committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas said this 
is a farm bill that i will be proud to defend on the house floor 
and its one that deserves the support of my house colleagues 
debate is likely to begin the week of june 25 
ready to attack is a group called the coalition for common sense 
agriculture led by reps richard armey rtexas and charles 
schumer dny the group of nonfarm area lawmakers oppose paying 
thousands of dollars in subsidies to farmers whose earnings are 
higher than the average taxpayer 
though the house agriculture committee has made progress by 
imposing a freeze on subsidies it is clear that some parts of the 
1990 farm bill do a disservice to american taxpayers armey and 
schumer said thursday in a joint statement 
rep silvio conte of massachusetts the ranking republican on 
the appropriations committee already has introduced a bill that 
attacks the farm payment programs by limiting farmers to 50000 a 
year in government payments 
too much of the farm budget is going to wealthy corporate 
farms not enough to family farmers and too much of the money does 
nothing to improve the supply and price of food for americans 
schumer and armeys statement said these trends need to change 
so that our agriculture policy reflects common sense rather than 
special interests 
committee members have argued vehemently that government 
programs supporting farmers stabilize food prices and help the 
government manage the industry 
the agriculture committee completed work on the bill with a 
marathon session beginning wednesday and ending early thursday 
morning in which lawmakers added changes in conservation measures 
to a host of other programs passed weeks earlier that guide 
agriculture policy for the next five years 
de la garza said the bill assures farmers a reasonable income 
but meets tight federal budget demands 
it also gives farmers more flexibility to plant according to 
market signals it provides authority for expanded food safety 
research and it allows for modest increases in our domestic food 
assistance programs de la garza said 
he said it would protect us competitiveness in the world 
market and prevent large stockpiles of surplus food 
i am particularly proud of the committees conservation 
package he said characterizing it as a balance between 
agriculture production needs and environmental quality goals 
major provisions of the bill include 
a freeze on target prices for cotton rice wheat and feed 
grains 
loan rates of 525 a bushel for soybeans during 199192 with 
possible increases in subsequent years 
a flexibility program that allows farmers who grow government 
supported crops to transfer 25 percent of their acreage into an 
experimental crop without losing that acreage in calculations for 
price supports 
a dairy program that sets a minimum support level of 1010 per 
hundred pounds of milk 
continuation of present peanut sugar honey wool and mohair 
programs 
a trade program that allows donation of commodities to the 
worlds poorest countries puts deadlines on multiyear agreements 
and forgives loans to the poorest countries it also would 
authorize assistance to private voluntary organizations and 
cooperatives in administering food programs and reauthorize the 
food for progress program which donates food to countries that 
encourage private enterprise and agricultural reform 
a requirement that the government spend at least 500 million 
annually in the export enhancement program which helps us 
commodities compete with other countries in the world market 
availability of 5 billion annually for credit guarantees on 
commodity sales to foreign countries under the governments six to 
36month credit program known as gsm102

senate negotiators unable to agree on 
campaign spending ceilings are likely setting up a bitter fight 
before the fourth of july recess 
were hung up on the same point we have been hung up on all 
along sen david boren dokla said after a 90minute meeting 
thursday were just going to have to buck it up to the 
senates two party leaders george mitchell dmaine and bob dole 
rkan 
boren said if negotiators cannot break the deadlock on spending 
limits in the next few days he advocated bringing the issue to the 
full senate 
we may need to take some votes to get the negotiations going 
forward he said 
mitchell had vowed earlier to bring a democratic campaign 
finance bill to the floor for action within the next two weeks 
with or without a compromise both mitchell and dole were expected 
to meet with their negotiating teams friday 
teams of five republicans and five democrats appointed by 
mitchell and dole agreed on several issues that had divided them in 
the past four weeks of closeddoor negotiations 
sen don nickles rokla said a majority of republicans may 
now be willing to consider a package that includes a ceiling on how 
much candidates can raise from outside their states but with no 
ceiling on instate contributions 
the same concept was proposed in march by a task force of 
academic experts and campaign professionals appointed by mitchell 
and dole 
but republicans balked at any kind of ceiling on contributions 
and democrats insisted on limits in bills the two parties brought 
to the senate floor last month 
boren said democrats are willing to abandon their call for a 
public financing scheme in which taxpayers could voluntarily pay an 
extra 3 a year when filling out their returns to pay for about 
half the cost of congressional campaigns 
he also said democrats are willing to outlaw political action 
committees as the republicans proposed in their bill and at least 
make unions publicly disclose the estimated 45 million in 
unreported funds they spend on getoutthevote and other political 
efforts 
however he said all those concessions are conditional upon 
republicans accepting some kind of spending limit 
everybody on the democratic side made it clear we are not 
going to let public financing or zeroing out pacs stand in the way 
of an agreement boren said but we cannot yield on overall 
spending limits 
both boren and nickles acknowledged that the rough agreements on 
specific issues forged by the negotiators particularly a cap on 
aggregate contributions from outside a candidates state lack 
unanimous support on either side 
theres still a lot of flexibility nickles said theres 
not too many people falling on swords on too many issues

mayor marion barrys announcement that he will 
not run for a fourth term brought no movement at all toward a 
plea bargain agreement a source close to the defense team says 
jury selection is drawing to a close in barrys cocaine and 
perjury trial with no sign of a settlement in the case 
jury selection began june 4 and us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson has said the panel of 12 jurors plus six 
alternates will be seated monday the pool of prospective jurors 
now stands at 83 in a process that was ending at midday today 
abc news and the washington post filed a motion thursday 
objecting to being excluded from a portion of the jury selection 
process 
challenges by lawyers in the case to particular jurors are 
taking place in private bench conferences the judge then announces 
which prospective jurors have been excused from possible jury duty 
but the reasons are not given abc and the post argue that such an 
approach impinges on the first amendment 
were just getting ready for trial barry lawyer r kenneth 
mundy said as he left court thursday 
jesse jackson called on mundy and us attorney jay b stephens 
mundy to resume pleabargain negotiations 
we certainly hope that there will be a move toward the 
bargaining table to work out some honorable agreement under the 
law jackson said after a meeting with local ministers the 
contrition of that speech cannot be ignored the mayor has admitted 
his problem and expressed his regret 
barrys supporters have said the mayor bowed out of the race in 
part because he hoped such a move would elicit sympathy from the 
jury or push his attorney and stephens to reach an agreement 
opening statements are scheduled for tuesday 
stephens has said barrys political plans would not affect his 
determination to proceed to trial 
the washington times reported today that stephens plans to 
present evidence of fraud and corruption in city government to a 
new grand jury to be seated next month raising the possibility of 
new charges against barry and other city officials 
the mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor charge of cocaine conspiracy 
and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use 
barry 54 went on local television wednesday night to announce 
his longrumored decision not to run for a fourth fouryear term 
that opens up the mayors race to a field that includes the 
districts delegate to congress walter fauntroy as well as two 
city councilmen

the senate approved a fiscal 1991 budget sort 
of 
by voice vote late thursday the senate passed a budget 
resolution chock full of numbers and fancy legislative language 
but rather than an attempt at setting fiscal policy the vote 
was a procedural step toward preventing a backlog of legislation 
while congress and the white house engage in a budget summit 
under senate rules the annual spending bills needed for the 
operation of government agencies cannot be considered until a final 
budget resolution is adopted 
the house on may 1 approved a 12 trillion budget spelling out 
federal spending priorities including a shift from military 
spending to domestic programs the senate then stopped short 
because lawmakers thought it would hamper the bipartisan budget 
talks 
this is simply an instrument by which we allow the 
appropriations committees to move forward under senate rules and 
procedure said senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn the process is not over by a long shot he said 
a very complicated matter but not a very important event 
said sen pete v domenici rnm ranking republican on the 
budget committee 
sen paul simon dill was less generous it is 
fundamentally a giving up on the budget process he said 
the senate resolution approved thursday sets a 503 billion cap 
the same as this year on spending for domestic and defense 
programs outside of entitlements and interest on the national debt 
the resolution includes language assuming the number will be 
changed and policy decisions inserted once the budget talks with 
the white house are concluded 
both the house and senate must agree on a single budget 
resolution for it to become binding on the two chambers it doesnt 
require the presidents signature 
house speaker thomas s foley said thursday the house did not 
intend to abandon its plan housesenate talks are expected to 
begin next week even as the budget summit continues

there are now new federal rules intended to 
keep kids from listening to dialaporn services 
under the regulations adopted thursday by the federal 
communications commission dialaporn companies must require 
either credit card payments access codes or scrambling they must 
notify phone companies of the adult service and the calls must 
show up on customers phone bills 
phone companies where possible are required to block access to 
the adult services unless a customer asks to have access to them 
the new rules are designed to comply with a 1989 supreme court 
ruling that said consenting adults may have access to indecent but 
not obscene commercial sex messages by telephone the high court 
threw out a law passed by congress that had banned phone sex 
messages 
in other 50 votes the commission 
proposed strict disclosure and access rules for companies that 
provide dial 0 operator services to the traveling public 
proposed rules that would deny broadcast and other 
communications licenses to convicted drug users who have been 
denied federal benefits by a judge 
in its dialaporn decision the commission readopted rules it 
had imposed in 1987 federal law at that time said sex messages 
could be transmitted to consenting adults as long as dialaporn 
providers adopted fcc rules to deny access to minors 
but congress fearing that enterprising youths still could gain 
access to telephone sex messages banned such services outright in 
april 1988 the congressional action negated the 1987 fcc rules 
in overturning that law the supreme court said the statute 
could apply only to commercial material that was judged obscene 
meaning patently offensive and without redeeming value not 
merely indecent 
fcc chairman alfred sikes noting the constitutional concerns 
raised by such laws said the fccs ruling thursday was an act of 
humanity by civilized people 
regarding operatorservices companies the commission said it 
was acting because its survey earlier this year found significant 
noncompliance with industrywide rules the fcc issued a little more 
than a year ago 
the proposed rules on the companies would include not only the 
companies that contract with longdistance carriers to provide pay 
phone and hotel service but also the owners of the business 
premises themselves

senate democrats have dropped the idea of 
trying to override president bushs veto of the 2 billion amtrak 
bill 
the house last week voted overwhelmingly to override but on 
tuesday the senate failed to get the twothirds majority needed to 
pass the bill over the presidents objections 
the vote would have been 6535 except majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine voted on the presidents side so that he could 
under senate rules ask for a reconsideration of the vote only 
members of the winning side may ask for a second look and mitchell 
promptly did so 
but apparently the democrats could not find the two additional 
votes they needed 
sen j james exon dnebr chairman of the commerce 
committees subcommittee on surface transportation said thursday 
night that the democrats would propose a new bill deleting the 
provision which drew the veto an expansion of interstate commerce 
commission power to regulate railroad takeovers 
bush has vetoed 11 bills and has yet to be overridden by

gulf coast residents braced for tar 
balls to wash ashore today from a 30mile oil slick left by the 
burning mega borg 
no one knew thursday where the globs of tar would wash up but 
the west end of galveston was a likely spot coast guard capt 
thomas greene said 
state officials were to dump oileating bacteria on the brown 
slick today 
the norwegian supertanker continued to spew oil today from a 
tank ruptured by a fire whose cause is the subject of a hearing in 
its third day 
the mega borgs chief engineer said thursday at the hearing that 
one of the ships pumps had been leaking fuel about six hours 
before the first explosion rocked the ship late last friday and 
triggered a series of fiery blasts 
norway consul general erik leikvang who convened the hearing in 
galveston played down the information saying the leak may seem 
an obvious factor to some but it may not be obvious to the 
experts 
some tar balls ranging from 1 foot to 18 inches in diameter 
washed ashore thursday on the west end of galveston officials 
could not say whether they occurred naturally came from previous 
spills or washed in from the mega borg 
tar balls are ugly but theyre not that environmentally 
damaging said bj buck wynne iii chairman of the texas 
water commission 
texas land commissioner garry mauro said 500 volunteers were 
prepared to scour beaches 
mauro and wynne were to head the experimental operation to 
spread oileating bacteria on the spill the process called 
bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria to reduce oil to 
an emulsion of fatty acids that are consumed by marine life 
bioremediation has been used in waste spills but not in open 
waters to clean up oil officials said 
the mega borg which was carrying 38 million gallons of light 
african crude has lost about 3 million gallons since the 
explosion but officials said most of that has either burned or 
evaporated 
salvage crews said they skimmed more than 76000 gallons of oil 
from the waters around the vessel 57 miles from galveston 
four fireboats showered the mega borg with water cannons and the 
rear section remained awash the flow of oil from a hole in the 
vessels 55 million center tank apparently slackened officials 
said 
salvage crews today planned to transfer oil from the ruptured 
tank into an empty tank to stop the flow cut off the fuel to the 
fire and correct the listing of the ship 
two men were killed in the explosion and two others who remain 
missing are believed to be dead seventeen others were injured 
none seriously 
the ships chief engineer balinder singh told the norwegian 
maritime inquiry that a pump located in the pump room where the 
explosion is believed to have originated leaked as the tankers 
oil was being transferred to a smaller ship 
he said he stopped the leak by tightening a coupling about six 
hours before the explosion 
lars foyen a representative of det norske veritas the 
norwegian equivalent of the american bureau of shipping testified 
that 14 pieces of machinery including pumps used to transfer the 
oil cargo were overdue for inspection 
aasmund saglokken a former tanker captain and field expert on 
the investigative board said the leak should not be blown out of 
proportion 
we cant draw any conclusions from this saglokken said

michigan motorists wont see sobriety 
checkpoints on the states roads anytime soon even though the us 
supreme court approved their use 
bethany goodman executive director of the michigan chapter of 
mothers against drunk driving said she had hoped thursdays 63 
ruling would mean roadblocks could be used by the fourth of july 
weekend 
i believe that a lot of lives would have been saved had a stop 
not been put on the implementation of sobriety check lanes she 
said and the sooner the better that we get these things 
implemented 
but the issue first returns to the michigan court of appeals to 
determine if the tactic violates the state constitution 
weve always considered our chances under the michigan 
constitution were better than under the us constitution said 
mark granzotto general counsel for the american civil liberties 
union in michigan the organization challenged the checkpoints on 
behalf of six lawmakers 
the appeals court could take a year or more to rule madd legal 
counsel michael rizik jr said 
the checkpoints were used just once in michigan in may 1986 
under an executive order from gov james blanchard wayne county 
circuit court judge michael stacey quickly barred them with an 
injunction 
i hope everyone understands how dangerous and 
precedentsetting the supreme court decision is said howard 
simon executive director of the michigan aclu 
checkpoint supporters say they will be an effective tool in 
fighting drunken driving which killed 705 people in michigan in 
1988 the last full year for which the state police had figures 
critics say other methods of catching drunken drivers or keeping 
them off the road are more efficient dissenting supreme court 
justice john paul stevens called checkpoints elaborate and 
disquieting publicity stunts that do little if anything to 
improve highway safety 
in michigans only checkpoint in may 1986 on a state highway 
126 drivers were stopped of two detained for further examination 
one was arrested 
an appeals court upheld staceys ruling barring the checkpoints 
the michigan supreme court declined to step in and state attorney 
general frank kelley asked the us supreme court to hear the case 
i was confident from the beginning that the stopping and 
observing of drivers at check lanes is no more a constitutional 
intrusion of privacy than security checks at airports and public 
buildings such as the supreme court kelley said 
democratic state rep morris hood who has sponsored a bill that 
would prohibit all michigan law enforcement agencies from setting 
up checkpoints countered an intrusion is an intrusion 
there is no such thing as minimal intrusion he said

a large number of american high school 
students are at risk of aids because of their drug use and sexual 
practices according to federal health researchers looking at 42 
new youth surveys 
the surveys taken in schools in various cities and states also 
found continued ignorance among a large number of high schoolers 
regarding what does and doesnt cause aids for example in most 
surveys less than half the kids knew that mosquito bites dont 
cause the disease 
the levels of misinformation are truly concerning but not 
knowing that a mosquito bite does not cause aids doesnt put a 
student at risk for aids said dr laura kann of the centers for 
disease control we are most concerned about the findings related 
to sex and drug use 
the 1989 surveys reported thursday by the cdc were conducted in 
30 states 10 us cities and two us territories 
between 7 percent and 40 percent of the students reported having 
four or more sex partners between 2 percent and 5 percent said 
they had injected cocaine heroin or other intravenous drugs 
since the human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids is 
spread through sex and sharing of drug needles kann said there 
are a large number of students throughout the united states that 
are at risk for hiv infection because of the behaviors they 
practice 
we need to do a better job of providing students with hiv 
education that would help them avoid behaviors that put them at 
risk 
the surveys indicated at least some students knew they were 
taking risks between 93 percent and 100 percent in the various 
surveys knew that aids can be transmitted by drug needles and 
between 74 percent and 98 percent knew that it can be spread by sex 
without use of condoms 
misconceptions about aids are still common only 32 percent to 
75 percent in the various surveys said correctly that aids cannot 
be acquired by giving blood between 22 percent and 67 percent knew 
that aids doesnt come from mosquito bites and between 44 percent 
and 85 percent knew that public toilets dont spread aids 
the findings both in behavior and awareness were similar to 
those in a smaller group of surveys conducted in 1988 
the surveys from the participating cities and states do not 
represent a national sampling and statebystate comparisons of 
the results are not statistically relevant the atlantabased cdc 
said because different locations reported different response rates 
and some may have asked only some questions to some students

a huge oil slick caused by the collision of two 
freighters has floated near the mouth of a leading northeastern 
port officials said today 
the 40squaremile slick is near the dalian port and is 
continuing to move east in the direction of north korea zhu li of 
the dalian marine safety supervision bureau said in a telephone 
interview 
the state oceanography bureau in beijing said it was chinas 
largest oil spill ever from an ocean vessel but it could not 
assess the seriousness of the environmental damage 
the spill has received little attention in the official media 
and there has been no outcry over responsibility 
the spill was caused by the june 8 collision of two 
japaneseowned freighters in the bohai gulf east of tianjin one 
vessel the maya 8 sank and began leaking its fuel oil it was not 
carrying any cargo 
the second ship the spring falcon loaded with magnesium ore 
rescued the maya 8s crew and continued its journey to japan 
both the oceanography bureau and the marine safety supervision 
bureau said they did not know how much oil the maya 8 was carrying 
the peoples daily which reported the slicks spread to near 
dalian said that as of thursday oil continued to leak from the 
vessel but the flow had slowed 
the slick near dalian appeared to be only one portion of the oil 
leak initial reports after the collision said oil was covering 
more than 480 square miles 
ms zhu said she did not know whether the spill would affect 
shipping and fishing in the gulf 
she said that by cutting off the oxygen supply to the water the 
oil spill had produced a red tide a proliferation of red 
organisms that can harm fish and plant life 
efforts are being made to clean up the oil she said but she 
could give no details she did not know the cost of the cleanup

the government must return millions of dollars of 
manuel noriegas assets unless it can prove he obtained them 
illegally a federal judge has ruled 
us district judge william hoeveler on thursday rejected 
prosecutors claims that the usordered seizure of at least 20 
million in noriegas assets was not subject to normal legal review 
because it involved treaties with third countries 
the power of the executive to deal with foreign governments is 
unquestionably great but it does not extend so far as to impinge 
on a criminal defendants right to due process the judge said 
hoeveler warned that if the us attorneys office balks at 
having to prove the money was illegally obtained he will order it 
released the judge set a hearing for wednesday 
the issue arose when noriegas attorneys asked to withdraw from 
the case saying they could no longer work because the government 
had taken all of the former panamanian leaders assets 
prosecutors tried to pay the defense attorneys directly but the 
deal fell through the defense attorneys then asked the judge to 
order the government to release the assets so they could pursue the 
expensive case 
the defense has estimated the government will spend almost 40 
million on the noriega trial and says it will need about 5 
million 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
prosecutors had no immediate comment 
defense attorneys hailed the ruling 
its a huge victory lead noriega attorney frank rubino 
said this is a unique order hes saying he will order this 
money freed if the government doesnt want to act 
the judge said the failure of the government to justify the 
seizures effectively deprives noriega of his constitutional right 
to counsel and protections against illegal search and seizure 
the government acknowledges freezing 27 noriegalinked bank 
accounts valued at about 20 million during the december invasion 
of panama troops also found 58 million in cash in noriegas 
quarters which it turned over to the new panamanian government 
the defense says us troops also took homes cars and other 
property 
rubino said he welcomed the chance to show those assets were 
legally earned noting the defense has long claimed noriega 
received 11 million from us intelligence agencies 
we are ready willing and able to show general noriega has 
received substantial amounts of money from various intelligence 
agencies which is not tainted or drug money said rubino 
noriega who surrendered to us troops jan 4 is being held in 
the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami on a february 
1988 indictment accusing him of taking 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin drug cartel to turn panama into a way station 
for cocaine trafficking

lee sharapa says she felt like a freak after 
cancer surgery disfigured her face but the 44yearold homemaker 
fought back with help from a loving family and a support group 
called lets face it 
the surgery five years ago destroyed the symmetry of mrs 
sharapas face she said many of her friends didnt understood what 
it was like to be stared at on the street 
today mrs sharapa has come to terms with looking different and 
is helping others with facial disfigurements feel less isolated 
through the group at michael reese hospital and medical center 
i think the group is going to be very very beneficial mrs 
sharapa said just in terms of selfesteem to make a person 
know that theyre not the only one in this boat 
three people attended the first meeting tuesday mrs sharapa 
hopes it will grow to as many as 20 people similar groups meet 
elsewhere in the united states and other countries including 
britain the home of christine piff who wrote a book called 
lets face it after her own cancer surgery 
chicago nurse laurel barbour decided to start the michael reese 
group after attending a medical meeting in new orleans where she 
met betsy wilson who founded lets face it in the united states 
three years ago in her hometown of concord mass 
i think it must be awful to be facially disfigured and to have 
to walk around ms barbour said 
disfigured people can get encouragement from each other that i 
cant provide for them as a nurse at all she said 
ms wilson lost her jaw to cancer surgery in 1972 and said she 
drew inspiration from ms piff whose 1985 book documented the 
ordeal of losing an eye and part of her palate to cancer surgery 
ms piff launched a lets face it movement in great britain to 
counter the insensitivity she was subjected to 
an estimated 350000 people in the united states each year 
suffer facially disfiguring injuries diseases burns or surgeries 
ms wilson said in a telephone interview this week 
a lot of people just become reclusive or alcoholic and they 
die that way in seclusion she said this is whats exciting 
about this its given a lot of people a lot of hope were able to 
share our humor and our humanity together young and old 
massachusettsbased lets face it has no formal membership but 
mails newsletters to about 4000 people it is merging with a 
canadian counterpart a torontobased group called about face ms 
wilson said 
there are similar groups all over the united states with 
different names she said including an indianapolis organization 
called face to face which runs a weekend camp for facially 
disfigured youngsters 
one of our goals is to educate the public to value the person 
behind the face said ms wilson who appeared on the oprah 
tv show in december and has made other public appearances to 
support the cause 
another goal is to educate the disfigured themselves she said 
including teaching them how to interpret peoples reactions 
most children stare at you because they think you hurt its 
compassion not cruel curiosity ms wilson said 
dr norman bernstein clinical associate in surgery and 
psychiatry at the university of chicago who has worked with 
disfigured patients for 30 years blamed society for many of their 
problems 
our society and most societies are frightened and troubled and 
angered by people who do not look right he said television 
has made it worse with all those millions of dollars in 
advertising about appearance 
mrs sharapa said living with disfigurement once seemed 
overwhelming at times but she has come to regard it as just part 
of life with the help of a loving family and friends 
to me im no different inside than i was five 10 years 
ago she said maybe this has made me a stronger person a 
better person i hope it has

louisianas house passed the nations 
toughest state abortion bill and sent it to the senate but gov 
buddy roemer promises a veto unless exceptions are made for victims 
of rape and incest 
the house voted 7427 thursday to sentence people to up to 10 
years in prison for performing abortions the house twice rejected 
amendments with the exceptions roemer wants 
a bill that treats rape and incest for what they are 
unusual extraordinary violent degrading and gives the mother a 
choice there i can live with that the democratic governor said 
proponents of the measure said they hope the conservative us 
supreme court eventually will receive the bill and use it to 
overturn the courts 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
state rep woody jenkins the bills democratic sponsor said he 
cant concern himself yet with roemers longstanding veto threat 
the governor will have to consider it and make the decision 
himself jenkins said if he would veto the bill we would 
certainly try to override it 
the louisiana legislature hasnt overridden a veto in 70 years 
jenkins said 
the bill could be in trouble in the senate where a number of 
lawmakers agree with roemer said sen mike cross he will handle 
the measure when it comes up for a senate vote expected in about 
two weeks the senate bill might contain exceptions for rape and 
incest 
the house bill would impose prison terms of up to 10 years and 
fines of up to 100000 on people who perform abortions it would 
not penalize women who receive abortions 
jenkins has claimed that abortion is tantamount to abuse against 
women he focused debate on whether life begins at conception and 
repeatedly referred to house committee testimony to that effect by 
dr jerome lejeune a french geneticist 
the louisiana legislature has a history of enacting tough 
abortion laws all of which have been stayed or declared 
unconstitutional during the past 15 years 
opponents called the measure an affront to women especially the 
poor 
what the house has done will awaken a strong majority in this 
state said robin rothrock leader of an abortion rights 
coalition people will come to this capitol and tell the 
legislature to stay out of our business

the new york publicist quoted miss taylor as saying i am 
finally glad to be going home my sole concern at this time is 
focused on my getting well and carrying on with my life 
throughout this experience i have learned how precious life 
is how much i love it and yearn to live more of it i am grateful 
to everyone who has supported me through this difficult period 
miss taylor had been in st johns since april 16 she had been 
in the hospitals intensive care unit for treatment of viral 
pneumonia at one point in late april her breathing was assisted 
by a ventilator 
she first entered daniel freeman marina hospital on april 9 with 
a persistent fever and a sinus infection doctors said when her 
condition worsened she was transferred to st johns 
on april 17 miss taylor responded to persistent rumors and 
issued a statement saying she had been tested for the aids virus 
and the tests were negative a pulmonary specialist at st johns 
said her life was in jeopardy the weekend of april 2122 when she 
was put on the respirator to aid her breathing 
on may 11 her doctor announced that she had developed a yeast 
infection of the blood and would undergo intravenous therapy 
through ms sam miss taylors physician michael roth said 
though miss taylor has shown tremendous improvement which permits 
her to leave the hospital her overall recovery depends on a 
significant period of convalescence which i believe she can do from 
home 
the screen beauty has won two oscars she starred in 
butterfield 8 whos afraid of virginia woolf cat on a 
hot tin roof and more than 50 other films

problems hounded her sending her to hospitals for at least 19 
major operations and countless treatments 
miss taylors health woes including her neardeath bouts with 
pneumonia in 1961 and 1990 became as much a part of hollywood lore 
as her oscarwinning performances and seven marriages

teenagers 
they said 2 live crew cant do a clean show and still rock 
what were going to do is were going to prove them all wrong 
luther luke skyywalker campbell said during thursday nights 
performance 
i consider it the pg version said gwinnett county police 
chief wayne bolden as the group finished its last song this is 
the first rap concert ive been to and im kind of enjoying it i 
like the beat 
i cant see where they violated obscenity laws but half the 
words i cant understand anyway he added 
campbell and another member of the miamibased rap group were 
arrested in florida last weekend after they played songs from their 
sexually explicit as nasty as they wanna be album at an 
alladult show a florida record store owner who sold the album 
also was arrested 
the arrests followed a federal judges ruling that the album

lyme disease a summertime threat in the great 
outdoors is up 62 percent in a year in the united states 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
lyme disease is up 15fold in the seven years since nationwide 
reporting began preliminary 1989 reports indicate 7402 cases 
compared with 4574 in 1988 and 491 in 1982 
georgia had the greatest percentage increase with 715 cases up 
from 53 the year before new york had the largest number of cases 
2916 up from 2637 a year earlier 
other states in the top five were connecticut with 754 up from 
362 new jersey with 649 up from 500 and pennsylvania with 585 
up from 306 
for those headed outdoors this summer preventive measures are 
warranted the cdc said they include avoiding tickinfested areas 
using tick repellant wearing protective clothing in the outdoors 
and frequently inspecting for the small pests 
lyme disease which can cause a red bullseye rash aches and 
nerve pain has been found most often in the northeastern 
midatlantic northcentral and northwestern states the cdc said 
the disease is treated with antibiotics but treatment can be 
difficult unless its caught early 
in georgia where the disease was up 12fold last year its 
probable that there were indeed more lyme disease cases but also 
better reporting of it state health officials said 
we think one major factor was recognition said tom mckinley 
of the state office of epidemiology also we have had an 
increased population of deer in georgia and also an increased 
population of the deer ticks which are responsible for 
transmission

a college student once honored as her 
countys dairy princess faces life in prison after being convicted 
of murder for strangling another young woman in a quarrel over a 
man they both dated 
jurors deliberated about 7 hours before returning the verdict 
against 20yearold lori esker about midnight thursday 
prosecutors had argued that she was obsessed with 26yearold 
bill buss and plotted the sept 20 killing of lisa cihaski his new 
girlfriend 
conviction of firstdegree intentional homicide carries a 
mandatory life prison sentence ms esker will be eligible for 
parole in 13 years nine months 
ms esker wept as sheriffs deputies escorted her from the 
courtroom to the marathon county jail today 
members of ms cihaskis family hugged each other some weeping 
as the verdict was announced 
ms esker always had to be number one and shes still number 
one she got number one said vilas cihaski the victims father 
referring to the firstdegree conviction 
ms eskers parents showed no emotion as the verdict was read 
and their daughter was led away they declined to comment 
ms eskers lawyer stephen glynn said strangulation is not 
something that a jury can easily accept as unintentional 
buss who sat near the front of the courtroom said afterward 
my life will never return to normal again because lisa will never 
be back 
he was about to become engaged to ms cihaski a onetime 
homecoming queen who worked as an assistant catering manager at a 
motel near wausau 
according to testimony ms esker drove 150 miles from river 
falls where she was a college student waited in the parking lot 
where ms cihaski worked strangled her with the victims narrow

ms cihaskis grandmother ada sigharter said the conviction 
never brings my lisa back but she ms esker got what she had

tragedy i just hope that some of the wounds that have existed 
in the community because of the case can now start to heal and 
people can get it behind them and go on 
he again reiterated that intent was the issue 
the length of time ms esker had to hold a belt around ms 
cihaskis throat before she died 2 to 8 minutes proved ms 
esker intended to kill her grau had told the jury in closing 
arguments 
ms eskers lawyer intends to appeal it is a real tough 
situation seeing somebody that young who is potentially going to be 
in prison for a very long time for something i am absolutely 
convinced she did not intend glynn said

the manufacturer of mazola corn oil announced that 
it would drop claims that imply the product reduces cholesterol 
cpc international inc based in englewood cliffs nj said 
thursday it had signed agreements with the federal trade commission 
and attorneys general in 10 states 
in a statement cpc said its future advertisements would avoid 
the use of statements which might be misinterpreted to mean that 
the use of corn oil would by itself lower serum cholesterol 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said he and his 
colleagues challenged ads that made claims such as mazola does 
what they said it could turn back my cholesterol i didnt believe 
it until my level dropped 17 percent 
the states alleged that the advertisements stressed the 
cholesterol lowering properties of these products without placing 
proper emphasis on the importance of the total diet 
todays consumers want to eat right and they are often swayed 
by the claims made by food producers shannon said but any 
food touted as a magic cure without stressing the need for an 
allaround healthy diet does consumers more harm than good 
cpc said the ads in question already had been withdrawn for 
other reasons months ago the company said it continues to believe 
that the interpretation of the advertising by the states and ftc 
does not reflect consumer understanding of this advertising 
the company also said it has supplied numerous studies 
supporting its position that a lowfat lowcholesterol diet which 
includes mazola corn oil can help lower cholesterol levels 
cpc did not admit any violations of law and said it was trying 
to avoid expensive legal proceedings 
the agreement calls for the company to pay 100000 to cover the 
costs of the investigation shannons office said 
the other states involved in the action were california 
florida illinois iowa minnesota missouri new york texas and 
wisconsin

islamic fundamentalists who scored a 
surprise victory in local elections told bar owners today to 
curtail alcohol sales and many algerians abandoned western garb 
for traditional dress 
hundreds of fundamentalists staged allnight celebrations in the 
capital parading through the streets with banners reading god is 
great and islamic republic 
the army and people are with you madani youths shouted 
referring to sheikh abassi madani leader of the islamic salvation 
front which decisively won tuesdays elections it was the first 
free vote in algeria since independence from france in 1962 
many men who normally wear western clothing appeared on the 
streets today in the traditional floorlength shirt or khamiss 
some cafe owners reported visits by fundamentalists 
omar ghermache who runs the wellknown la pecherie restaurant 
said a band of young men wearing khamisses and beards advised him 
to serve alcohol from now on only to europeans 
madani has said women will not be forced to wear the islamic 
scarf or hijab but his followers have steadily pressured female 
students and teachers to adopt the traditional garb 
the government has not yet replied to the demands of madani to 
dissolve parliament and hold early national elections it also has 
not responded to suggestions that the governing national liberation 
front propose a coalition with the fundamentalists 
the national liberation front was algerias only legal political 
party until constitutional reforms were implemented last year 
in final results announced thursday by interior minister mohamed 
salah mohammedi the islamic salvation front won 853 of the 1539 
municipal councils at stake 
the national liberation front carried 487 and the anticlerical 
rally for culture and democracy gained 87 the rest went to small 
parties and independents 
the fundamentalists captured 32 provincial councils mohammedi 
added the governing party took 14 the rally for culture and 
democracy one and independent candidates one 
the turnout was 65 percent of the 128 million registered 
voters an unusually low total for algeria two parties opposed to 
both the governing party and the fundamentalists boycotted the 
elections 
madani told the french tv network tf1 that algeria was in no 
danger of being swept by radical iranian fundamentalism we are 
moslems not fundamentalists he said 
however his party advocates the use of islamic law and 
restricts women to a subservient role 
fundamentalists in other north african countries hailed the 
results of the election 
in tunisia the leader of the unauthorized islamic 
fundamentalist party rachid ghannounchi said the election was a 
divine day by the grace of god which will have consequences for 
the entire maghreb 
the maghreb consists of algeria tunisia morocco libya and 
mauritania 
fundamentalist opposition leaders in morocco hailed the results 
the al alam newspaper said the june 12 election day will stand as a 
major date in history 
irans official tehran radio said algerian voters have given 
proof of the fact that the great force of islam is a decisive 
factor in political life of all north african countries 
in this favorable terrain islam can spread very quickly 
the radio said irans government came to power in a 1979 islamic 
revolution 
moderate governments from egypt to morocco appeared reluctant to 
comment on the election results but the moroccan newspaper al 
bayane usually close to government thinking said that democratic 
reform in algeria had benefited a movement known for its 
authoritarian and intolerant leanings 
the entire union of the arab maghreb is shaken by the way in 
which its central pivot algeria has been rendered fragile it 
said 
libya bans islamic fundamentalism and egypt suppresses it 
although the moslem brotherhood holds seats in egypts parliament 
in algiers the uncertain political future dominated 
conversation thursday many algerians are anxious to know whether 
the military will remain on the sidelines and how women will be 
affected by the fundamentalists gains 
in france extremeright leader jeanmarie le pen predicted a 
flood of new algerian immigrants fleeing islamic repression le pen 
favors expelling the moslem immigrants already in france 
politicians across the spectrum said fear of a new wave of 
immigrants would benefit le pens national front at the ballot box 
one extremism creates another remarked centrist politician 
jacques barrot weve got to break this vicious circle

government troops killed at least 22 
tamil rebels today in attacks in northern and eastern sri lanka 
that occurred shortly after five soldiers died in a guerrilla 
ambush military officials said 
a senior government minister flew to the rebel stronghold of 
jaffna seeking an end to five days of bloodshed 
the deaths brought to about 270 the number of people killed 
since monday the fighting is the worst since peace talks began in 
may 1989 between the government and the rebels who are seeking an 
independent tamil state 
earlier today the military said tamil guerrillas known as 
tigers killed at least 23 of 69 policemen captured when rebels 
overran a police station in kinniya in northeastern trincomalee 
district on wednesday 
it was the second reported mass killing of captured police 
officers during the latest outbreak of violence about 114 
policemen who surrendered monday at the eastern kalmunai police 
station in eastern sri lanka were lined up on the ground and shot 
and killed by rebels a surviving policeman said 
witnesses have said an additional 110 government troops rebels 
and civilians have been killed in the fighting throughout sri 
lankas embattled northeast 
today troops struck back at rebels recapturing several of the 
20 police staions taken by rebels and chasing guerrillas out of at 
least two communities earlier today five soldiers died and one 
was injured when rebels ambushed a jeep patrol south of vavuniya 
135 miles northeast of colombo officials said 
at least six rebels were killed when troops recaptured two 
police stations and cleared guerrillas out of trincomalee a 
seaport town officials said twelve rebels were killed when troops 
recaptured the police station in muttur the officials said on 
condition of anonymity 
police commandos also recaptured pottuvil police station in 
eastern sri lanka killing four guerrillas officials said 
and troops cleared northern vavuniya of rebels officials said 
justice minister shahul hameed left colombo the capital this 
morning for the rebel stronghold of jaffna in northern sri lanka to 
meet tamil tiger rebel leaders in an effort to end the fighting 
but elsewhere rebels continued their attacks on at least four 
army camps and a police station the officials said

escaping to a naval base officials said the other army camps 
under attack were kiran kalavanchukudi and muttur on the east 
coast rebels also attacked a police station in the east officials 
said 
this weeks fighting shattered a ceasefire that took effect 
when the government and rebels opened negotiations 13 months ago to 
end the 7yearold tamil revolt against the sinhalesedominated 
government 
the tamils who are mainly hindu represent 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people they claim they are discriminated 
against by the majority sinhalese who are predominantly buddhist 
the tigers took virtual control of the tamildominated north and 
east after india withdrew its peacekeeping force in march after an 
unsuccessful 32month mission to disarm the rebels 
the latest round of fighting began after a tamil man told the 
tigers he was assaulted by a sinhalese policeman at the batticaloa 
police station on sunday 
at least 11000 people including 1200 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the tamil war since it started in 1983 another 
6000 have been killed in violence instigated by sinhalese 
extremists who claim the government has been too weak in dealing 
with the tamils

for the rights of his people last year the vatican issued a 
major document on racism that harshly condemned apartheid 
turning to reporters mandela said the anc believes sanctions 
need to be maintained and i asked them the holy see to express 
themselves very clearly on this issue 
i asked our father the pope to bless this initiative because 
we are sure his blessing would help because his stands on issues 
like apartheid and antisemitism have been so clear they have won 
respect from the whole world 
john paul replied in english god bless your initiatives 
in a statement the vatican said the audience granted to mandela 
was further confirmation of the holy sees commitment in favor of 
a peaceful political evolution in south africa and the 
progressive overcoming of the system of apartheid

prime minister yitzhak shamir today blamed us 
criticism of israel for stirring up growing arab hostility toward 
the jewish state 
aggressive intentions begin to surface in the arab world 
as soon as they see cracks or breaches in the wall of friendship 
between israel and the united states shamir said in an interview 
today in the jerusalem post 
a top aide to shamir meanwhile suggested israel would not 
accept an earlier us compromise plan on peace talks 
the comments by shamir and his aide followed sharp remarks by 
us secretary of state james a baker iii urging israels new 
rightwing government to move to restart the stalled peace process 
baker testifying before a senate committee wednesday 
sarcastically recited the telephone number of the white house 
switchboard and said when youre serious about this call us 
baker proposed in october that israelis and palestinians meet in 
cairo for preliminary peace talks palestinian delegates would 
include people deported from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
and others who have homes in both the territories and 
israeliannexed east jerusalem 
the formula was intended as a compromise between israels 
refusal to talk to the plo and the stance by the plo that 
palestinians outside the territories should be included in talks 
a top shamir aide asked today whether the baker plan was still 
relevant said we are asking to start from the beginning to 
get the process on a track that will not lead us to negotiations 
with a delegation composed by the plo and that will lead us into 
the danger of a palestinian state 
it is unacceptable that they the americans return exactly to 
this point and propose the same questions to the new government 
that has been formed said yossi benaharon director of the 
prime ministers office speaking on israel army radio 
baker said on wednesday that there wont be any dialogue 
there wont be any peace if israels new government makes 
unacceptable demands for palestinian participation in peace talks 
the baker comments drew angry reaction today from some members 
of the shamir coalition 
a senior legislator of shamirs rightwing likud bloc complained 
that the united states which pays 3 billion in aid to israel 
every year was acting like a colonial ruler 
after all we are not a colony we are a sovereign state 
eliyahu benelissar head of parliaments defense and foreign 
affairs committee said on israel radio today we are not 
obligated to give positive answers to everything the americans ask 
for everything baker proposes 
in the occupied territories israeli troops destroyed the homes 
of four palestinians and sealed a fifth today as punishment for 
attacks on soldiers and arabs accused of collaborating with israel 
the army said 
since the suspects lived in typical palestinian fashion within 
extended families the houses destroyed and sealed were home to 74 
people 
the demolitions raised to nine the number of houses destroyed 
this week in the occupied west bank and gaza strip three houses 
were sealed 
israels practice of destroying and sealing houses of 
palestinian suspects been criticized by the united states and human 
rights groups as collective punishment 
the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories said at the end of may that 293 palestinian homes had 
been destroyed and 173 sealed since the start of the 30monthold 
uprising

iran agreed today to pay the 
american oil company amoco 600 million for facilities seized 
during the 1979 islamic revolution according to an official of the 
claims panel 
it was the first major settlement of more than 18 billion 
worth of us corporate oil claims filed against iran at the 
iranunited states claims tribunal arbitrating financial claims by 
the two nations since 1981 
settlement of the oil claims would be a major step toward 
resuming oil trading ties between iran and the united states 
the two nations severed ties after the islamic revolution led 
by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the seizure of american 
hostages who were held by iranian militants at the us embassy in 
tehran for 444 days 
the haguebased tribunal was set up as part of the algiers 
accord of 1980 which paved the way for the release of hostages 
it has been the only official forum where american and iranian 
officials have been meeting throughout their nations decadelong 
confrontation 
american and iranian officials have stressed their talks deal 
only with financial arbitration and do not consider the fate of the 
six american hostages still being held in lebanon but another 
smaller settlement was reached at the tribunal last month shortly 
after two ameican hostages were freed in lebanon 
the tribunal has three american three iranian and three 
thirdnation arbitrators and has so far settled 32 billion worth 
of governmenttogovernment and private claims including todays 
settlement 
oil accounts for 90 percent of irans foreign exchange earnings 
and the absence of the american market has been a major financial 
blow to a nation whose economy was ravaged by the eightyear 
persian gulf war with iraq 
president hashemi rafsanjani has been seeking to restore and 
expand trade links with the west but he has faced opposition from 
islamic militants who want no dealings with the united states 
todays settlement concerned claims by two amoco subsidiaries 
against the national iranian oil co according to the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with tribunal policy 
the amoco iran oil co filed the largest of the two claims 
worth 540 million for the expropriation by iran of four offshore 
drilling fields in the gulf known as nowruz ardeshir cyrus and 
darius the official said the darius field includes kharg island 
the shipping point for most iranian oil 
the second claim for 60 million was filed by amoco 
international finance corp and related to irans seizure of a 
petrochemical plant on kharg the official said 
the amoco package as a whole was one of the most strongly 
contested claims it removes a lot of work from the tribunal 
the official told the associated press 
todays settlement leaves pending more than 12 billion worth 
of claims from oil companies which did business in 
prerevolutionary iran according to the official 
it followed last months settlement of about 3000 financial 
claims totaling 105 million known as the small claims package 
the small claims package was signed shortly after the release of 
american hostages frank reed and robert polhill by proiranian 
kidnappers in beirut 
the biggest item still on the tribunals agenda is an iranian 
claim of up to 11 billion for military equipment ordered by the 
shahs government but never delivered because of the us embargo 
imposed on the government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the us government contends that much of the material iran is 
claiming compensation for is not under its control but belongs to 
individual contractors who were never paid 
washington claims it has found buyers for some of the equipment 
iran did pay for and has deposited the money in irans accounts 
after the revolution

a member of the communist party politburo 
confirmed today that the blockade of natural gas to lithuania will 
be partially lifted starting saturday as a gesture of kremlin good 
will 
meanwhile lithuanias president vytautas landsbergis marking 
the 50th anniversary of the soviet occupation of the baltic 
republic said today a kremlin offer of future sovereignty might be 
looked upon favorably 
moscow ordered the cutoff of all oil most natural gas and some 
raw material shipments to lithuania in april in an effort to 
persuade the republic to rescind its independence declaration of 
march 11 
on wednesday the kremlin gave the first sign it may be ready to 
ease the blockade perhaps because of mounting domestic opposition 
to it the sanctions have idled 26000 lithuanian workers 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov reportedly told lithuanian 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene on wednesday that 15 percent of 
the republics natural gas supply would be restored however there 
had been no sign of the gas actually arriving 
at a news conference today politburo member yuri maslyukov said 
natural gas supplies to a large fertilizer plant in lithuania would 
be turned back on as promised in the talks between mrs prunskiene 
and ryzhkov 
at that meeting as far as i know there was a request from 
prunskiene to supply gas maslyukov said ryzhkov gave that 
instruction that is 35 million cubic meters of gas starting from 
tomorrow to be supplied to that plant 
maslyukov said it was a goodwill gesture from the soviet union 
and a reiteration of the soviet goverments interest in speeding 
negotiation 
a spokesman at the jonova fertilizer plant mysyunas tautvid 
said the company received a telegram confirming that natural gas 
supplies would be restored saturday 
on thursday the moscow city council discussed sending gasoline 
to the baltic republic to ensure it has enough fuel to keep up milk 
supplies to russia the postfactum news service said thursday that 
the council which is dominated by radical reformers is thinking 
of sending gasoline in rail tank cars guarded by council members 
food is always in short supply in the soviet union but with the 
recent panic buying touched off by the new economic government 
plan moscow officials are especially concerned about keeping their 
sources of dairy products 
the newly elected president of the russian federation boris 
yeltsin already has promised to send supplies to lithuania the 
presidents of several other republics reportedly told president 
mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday that the embargo should be stopped 
in lithuania the republics supreme council legislature held a 
special session to commemorate the red armys entrance into the 
baltic republic after a secret sovietgerman agreement placing the 
area under soviet control 
algimintas cekuolis an adviser to the supreme council quoted 
landsbergis as saying that a suggestion by gorbachev on tuesday to 
create a new union of sovereign states could be seen in a 
maybe positive light 
but he quoted landsbergis as saying we have to have 
guarantees and clearly visible deeds 
the country that attacked us in 1940 and has committed many 
acts of international injustice including now keeping occupied 
holdings has to prove its good will with something more 
substantial than just declarations cekuolis quoted landsbergis 
as saying 
lithuania latvia and estonia were forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 all three baltic republics want back the 
sovereignty lost at that time

ban against political activity by government workers saying the 
measure would destroy the essential political neutrality of the 
federal work force 
bush said the legislation to liberalize the 51yearold hatch 
act would inevitably lead to repoliticizing the government 
bureaucracy 
it was the 12th veto of bushs presidency congress has yet to 
override one just this week the senate sustained bushs veto of 
an amtrak authorization bill by a twovote margin 
in vetoing the hatch act measure bush said that after all 
the debate no real need to repeal the existing hatch act has been 
demonstrated 
for more than half a century the hatch act has successfully 
insulated the federal service from the undue political influence 
that would destroy its essential political neutrality bush said 
the bill would substantially erase prohibitions that now 
restrict the nations 3 million federal civil service and postal 
employees to little more than voting 
it would allow them to hold office in a political party to 
attend political conventions as a delegate and in some cases to 
solicit political contributions from coworkers practices now 
prohibited 
sponsors said that the measure would extend the same fundamental 
freedoms now enjoyed by the rest of the population to federal and 
postal workers 
but bush argued we cannot afford in the final decade of 
this century to embark on a retreat into the very worst aspects of 
public administration from the last century 
bush said the restrictions did not go far enough 
as one who has devoted much of his life to public service i 
take great pride in the integrity of our federal work force said 
the president who began his career with the federal government as 
a house member in the mid1960s 
bushs veto had been expected 
the house approved the measure 33487 on tuesday 
the senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 6730 
thats enough for a veto override but gop senate leaders have 
expressed confidence they can persuade one or two of their 
colleagues to change votes to sustain a veto

a major uscanadian trade agreement has 
worked well in its first 18 months although it is plagued by some 
paperwork problems businesses from both sides of the border told 
congress today 
implementation of the freetrade agreement has occurred as 
smoothly as might be expected and the customs services of both 
countries performed remarkably under less than ideal 
circumstances michael hachee of the customs brokers association 
in champlain ny testified before the house small business 
committee 
andrew vanderwal of toronto vice president of canadian 
importers association inc said some paperwork requirements 
create substantial business costs that detract from the trade 
liberalization of the agreement 
witnesses agreed that the problems center around requirements 
that a product being shipped across the border be accompanied by a 
certificate of origin which must be signed by the exporter 
this is a very timeconsuming and costly process particularly 
for firms that ship tens of thousands of different small parts and 
other items vanderwal said 
rep john lafalce dny chairman of the committee said he 
has received complaints in addition to those about paperwork some 
businesses have complained about a lack of practical information on 
procedures and others are concerned about administrative problems 
encountered at the border lafalce said 
john p simpson deputy assistant secretary of the treasury 
said the administration is pleased with the first 18 months under 
the agreement which by 1998 will result in the worlds largest 
freetrade zone 
the structure of the agreement itself has not been shown to 
need a major overhaul and the particular problems we have 
discovered are being resolved expeditiously with the full 
cooperation of the canadian government simpson said

several prominent roman catholic politicians 
said they wouldnt change their position favoring abortion rights 
despite cardinal john oconnors warning that they could be 
excommunicated 
im prepared to put my soul in the hands of god rather than 
the cardinal state sen nicholas spano said in a typical 
response to oconnors warning 
but new york gov mario cuomo who has sparred with oconnor 
over the abortion issue for years said the pronouncement worried 
him even though it appeared consistent with the cardinals 
previous statements 
i dont like to hear it how could you this is something 
fundamental to our family the governor said thursday 
cuomo has said he personally opposes abortion but believes the 
decision is up to each individual 
cuomo and other new york politicians were reacting to oconnors 
strongest and clearest statement yet on the fate of those who 
advocate a womans right to an abortion it was delivered in an 
article in catholic new york the weekly archdiocesan newspaper 
at the same time a roman catholic diocese in grand rapids 
mich is threatening to excommunicate a democratic candidate for 
state senate because she supports abortion rights 
a spokesman for the diocese michael ghering said church 
officials are investigating jo mclachlans prochoice stand and 
could decide to excommunicate her 
mclachlan said she wont change her position she is active in 
sacred heart catholic church in evart in northwestern lower 
michigan 
the issue is a catholic political position rather than the 
teaching of the church she said as an american citizen i have 
a right to dissent and i am a dissenting catholic i think the 
church is wrong 
some church experts said canon law does not uphold oconnors 
position 
hes wrong said the rev richard mcbrien chairman of the 
theology department at the university of notre dame on the 
question of abortion the only person clearly subjected to 
excommunication would be the person who procures the abortion 
that would be the woman and perhaps her doctor but not any 
politicians he said 
mario cuomo is not performing abortions mario cuomo is not 
running an abortion clinic on the side said mcbrien he 
oconnor doesnt really have a canonical leg to stand on 
the rev robert drinan a former massachusetts congressman 
agreed that oconnors statements were misguided 
that goes against what the bishops have been saying said 
drinan a georgetown university law center professor i think 
that wont be taken that seriously 
but the rev joseph penna speaking for the archdiocese of new 
york said that a person could be excommunicated even if they do 
not directly take part in an abortion 
it goes beyond who procures an abortion said penna of st 
josephs seminary in yonkers if church officials determined that 
an individual served as an accomplice to an abortion by giving 
scandal to other people that person could be excommunicated he 
said 
and by giving scandal i mean a person would look at someone 
else and say if that person can do it so can i said penna 
speaking of the leadership roles that politicians play in society

presidentelect ion iliescu today 
ordered miners he had summoned to help put down antigovernment 
riots to go home but many remained in the capital clubbing anyone 
they considered a government opponent 
iliescus swearingin as president was postponed amid the chaos 
the miners streamed into bucharest on thursday after iliescu 
called for their help in countering what he called facist 
forces the miners beat pedestrians and journalists and raided the 
offices of opposition parties 
the state news agency rompres said iliescu met with the miners 
leaders today and ordered them to leave the capital and that 
miners began boarding buses for bucharests northern railway 
station 
from there they were to return on special trains to their homes 
in the jiu valley mining region of western romania but an hour 
after the announcement miners were still roaming central bucharest 
iliescu was to have been sworn in today at a meeting of both 
houses of parliament but a woman answering the phone at his 
office who refused to give her name said the session was put off 
until monday she would not elaborate 
this is a death of democracy said opposition leader ion 
ratiu whose home was ransacked by maurauding miners its the 
rule of the mob no respect for human rights the forces of law and 
order stand by instead of maintaining law and order 
following the december prodemocracy revolution that ousted the 
hardline communist government and set up elections that iliescu 
and his national salvation front won ratiu returned to romania 
after 50 years in exile despite the latest violence he said he 
would stay and fight for democracy 
premier petre roman told a news conference today that the miners 
had been asked to occupy university square in a peaceful way and 
all subsequent violence was deplorable on wednesday police broke 
up a 53day protest in the square by anticommunist protesters who 
distrust iliescus ties to the former regime 
government forces later fired on the protesters who attacked 
government buildings killing at least five people and injuring 
more than 350 
then the miners arrived 
mirela roznoveanu a journalist with the romania libera 
newspaper said the miners beat a coworker and destroyed the 
editorial offices of the newspaper thursday the paper which had 
been the main voice of opposition against iliescu and the 
government did not appear today 
the violence by the miners thursday was the latest outburst in 
the capitals worst street fighting since the bloody december 
revolution that ousted and executed communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
rompres quoted an unidentified spokesman for the miners as 
saying nobody had invited them to come to bucharest but it was 
clear they were being given at least logistical support with 
municipal buses and army trucks transporting them by the hundreds 
to key points in the city 
on thursday unidentified people in a van carrying loudspeakers 
warned passersby dont incite the miners you would thus 
give birth to fierce violence the speakers also instructed the 
miners to grab journalists and take them into the van we will 
take care of them they said 
dozens of people were assaulted and clubbed by the helmeted 
miners 
about 10 miners besieged the residence of iliescu critic dumitru 
mazilu for several hours before dispersing according to mazilu and 
a neighbor 
mazilu the former vice president of the postrevolutionary 
government stepped down following charges that he collabrated with 
the securitate the secret police force that killed hundreds during 
the revolution 
the miners were apparently directed by several men who mazilu 
said were securitate or former securitate agents 
rompres reported that marian munteanu head of the antiiliescu 
students alliance was hospitalized with unspecified injuries 
miners near the square boasted they had beaten the student leader 
the miners also occupied and ransacked opposition party 
headquarters including those of the 21st of december organization 
of students who fought against ceausescu 
other government suporters ransacked the headquarters of the 
opposition liberal party as well as bucharest universitys faculty 
of foreign languages

miners from across the soviet union 
today passed a vote of no confidence in the communist party and 
called for the party to relinquish its assets they also agreed to 
form an independent union 
we are workers but we do not consider the communist party of 
the soviet union our party said the resolution we call for a 
mass exit from the party 
the resolution demanded that the party relinquish its control 
over large state enterprises and give up holdings including 
property and bank accounts filled with members dues 
the resolution approved by a vote of 308116 said communists 
could no longer present themselves as champions of workers rights 
the communist party is losing its authority said a 
resolution passed by the first congress of soviet miners meeting in 
the don basin coal mining region of the eastern ukraine 
the resolution created a committee to set up the framework of a 
miners union free of government or communist party control that 
framework will be considered at a second miners congress in moscow 
on aug 1516 
the push for an independent union opens another rift between 
soviets and their government 
president mikhail s gorbachev has encouraged decentralization 
but formation of an independent miners union would mean the 
government would have less control over workers who are seen as the 
backbone of the communist system 
being outside the government structure would also make it easier 
for the workers to organize strikes another threat to the 
faltering economy 
miners also gave a warm welcome to two american trade union 
representatives richard wilson of the aflcio and john j banovic 
of the united mine workers of america 
both americans promised that their unions would assist the new 
independent soviet miners union 
a free society requires independent trade unions requires the 
right of association free of government and party control 
declared wilson who said he was the first aflcio reprsentative to 
be allowed into the soviet union 
it requires that workers make their own decisions he said 
earlier today miners backed away from renewing last summers 
nationwide coal strike protesting poor mine conditions housing 
food and consumer goods 
on thursday the 712 delegates representing every coal mine in 
the country passed a resolution calling for the resignation of 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov and drove the soviet mining 
minister from their meeting with angry shouts and demands 
politburo member yuri d maslyukov the head of the state 
planning commission told a news conference in moscow today that 
the miners declaration of no confidence in the government was a 
very alarming and serious signal 
he said the government wanted miners to know that we are not 
going to infringe on the interests of the population including the 
miners but we want to set up a correct policy to get the country 
out of the situation that it has found itself in 
the miners miners debated whether to try to take over the 
existing union or base a new organization on workers committees 
formed during the nationwide coal strike that crippled heavy 
industry last summer 
we dont know whether a free union is really needed said 
yuri balderov a member of the donetsk workers committee that 
organized the congress 
some miners have said they feared that breaking ties with the 
old union which is under the mining ministrys control would deny 
them access to vacation resorts pensions and other benefits to 
which they have already made financial contributions 
it appeared the miners would not vote to stage another strike 
although many delegates to the congress accused the government of 
failing to fulfill the promises it made to end last julys walkout 
many miners said a strike could do more harm than good 
a telegram the miners sent to national lawmakers criticized the 
government the government of the ussr does not have our 
trust said the telegram sent wednesday to the national supreme 
soviet legislature in moscow 
we urge workers in other industries to quickly cut their ties 
with the government said the telegram read aloud thursday at 
the supreme soviet 
the telegram also criticized an economic reform plan proposed 
last month by ryzhkov and defended on national television by 
gorbachev

a court on friday convicted a researcher for a 
government scientific agency of passing on information on nuclear 
research to the east german secret service for two decades 
rolf dobbertin an east german national was sentenced to 12 
years in prison 
at the start of his trial wednesday dobbertin defended his 
actions by saying east german intelligence officials had coerced 
him into providing information 
dobbertin 55 had testified that he was awarded a grant to 
study abroad but was not allowed to accept it unless the secret 
service approved 
in our country nothing could be done without the 
authorization of the security services he said dont forget 
this was during the cold war they wanted to be able to contact me 
at any moment and i had to learn how to code and decode messages 
dobbertin was hired 30 years ago at frances national center for 
scientific research and passed on information on nuclear research 
and other topics to east germany for about 20 years 
the sentence imposed by the presiding judge was harsher than the 
fiveyear term requested by the prosecutor 
judge maurice colomb asked if dobbertin still considered himself

industrial production jumped 06 percent in 
may the federal reserve said friday but analysts said the sharp 
gain was due mainly to a temporary buildup in automobile 
inventories 
i think it was somewhat of a fluke said economist paul 
getman of regional financial associates in west chester pa 
excluding motor vehicles and parts industrial production was up 
02 percent that is more in line with the underlying 
fundamentals 
michael k evans head of evans economics inc a washington 
economic forecasting firm contended the inventory building in the 
auto industry was due to concern over the expiration of the big 
three auto makers labor contracts in september 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new 
york government securities dealer noted that the auto makers 
reported a drop in output in the first 10 days of june 
so industrial production is showing only temporary strength 
and will probably tilt in a weaker direction in coming months as 
automakers in particular have to scale back production more in line 
with demands he said 
two government reports earlier this week pointed to slowing 
consumer demand as the job market weakens and wages fall consumer 
spending which accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity has been a driving force for the economy for 
much of the last eight years 
declining consumer spending combined with tighter restrictions 
on credit in many parts of the country could threaten to push 
the economy over the edge into a recession in the second half of 
the year jones said 
in addition to auto production evans said some of the increased 
output was due to exports which analysts have credited for helping 
sustain recent us economic growth 
the commerce department reported friday that exports helped 
shrink the us trade deficit so far this year to an annual rate of 
9216 billion compared to a deficit for all of 1989 of 10899 
billion 
industrial production has risen each month since january except 
for april when it was unchanged but even the flat april figure 
was an improvement over the 04 percent decline first reported last 
month 
industrial production at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods rose 08 percent in may after 
slipping 02 percent in april 
output of durable goods bigticket items expected to last at 
least three years jumped 13 percent after a 02 percent decline 
a month earlier manufacturing of nondurable goods such as food 
and clothing was up 02 percent following a 04 percent gain in 
april 
output at mines was unchanged in may after a 07 percent advance 
the previous month utility production was down 11 percent 
following a 07 percent increase in april 
the fed said its industrial production index in may stood at 
1097 percent of its 1987 base up from 1090 in april 
the fed also reported the operating rate of the nations 
factories mines and utilities which usually move in tandem with 
industrial production rose 03 percent to 836 percent in may 
the operating rate measures not only output but also changes in 
productivity levels 
the operating rate at factories producing durable goods rose 08 
percent to 820 percent while the rate at plants making 
nondurable goods inched downward 01 percent to 843 percent 
the operating rate at mines was unchanged at 889 percent while 
it dropped a full 10 percent to 849 percent at utilities

east german authorities today arrested a west 
german couple wanted for masterminding a string of terrorist 
attacks including the 1985 bombing of a us military base 
authorities said 
the two were among seven terrorist suspects arrested thursday 
and today officials said one was freed because charges against 
her had expired 
in the past 10 days the two german governments have made a 
concerted effort to solve decadeold terrorist cases sometimes 
using intelligence information left behind by east germanys ousted 
communist government 
the terrorist suspects had apparently hidden in east germany 
with the help of communist authorities 
the east german interior ministry said barbara and horst meyer 
probably west germanys most wanted terror suspects were nabbed 
today at the main train station in the city of leipzig after being 
spotted by travelers 
they are wanted in connection with attacks including a car 
bombing that killed two people and wounded 20 others at the us 
air forces rheinmain air base near frankfurt in august 1985 
arrested today with the meyers was sabine elke callsen 29 who 
is wanted in a pair of 1985 bombing attacks the interior ministry 
said 
a day earlier four suspects two married couples with young 
children were arrested in frankfurt an der oder and cottbus 
according to hansgeorge fuchs a spokesman for the west german 
federal police office in wiesbaden 
at a news conference in east berlin interior minister 
petermichael diestel said one of those who was taken into custody 
thursday christine duemlein was freed because her west german 
arrest warrant had expired 
the six suspects remaining are believed to be members of the 
notorious red army faction a radical leftist group that claimed 
responsibility for a string of bombings and killings in the 1970s 
and 1980s 
the suspects arrested thursday are monika helbing 36 and 
ekkehard von seckendorffgudent 49 in frankfurt an der oder and 
werner lotze 38 and ms duemlein 41 in cottbus von 
seckendorffgudent is a physician and holds the title of baron 
all had been living under assumed names diestel said 
the arrests came just days after the capture of two other 
prominent members of the red army faction whose members have been 
among the most soughtafter fugitives in west german history 
officials on wednesday arrested inge viett 46 who had been 
living under an assumed name in the east german city of magdeburg 
susanne albrecht 39 was arrested june 6 outside her apartment in 
east berlin 
she told police this week that the former communist secret 
police gave her a false identity and helped her settle in the 
country diestel has accused the secret police of harboring western 
terrorists 
ms helbing lotze and ms albrecht have been linked to the 
kidnapslaying in 1977 of west german industrialist hannsmartin 
schleyer and numerous other terrorist crimes 
ms albrecht and lotze also have been linked to the 1977 slaying 
of juergen ponto the head of west germanys secondbiggest bank 
west german authorities have accused ms viett of taking part in 
the murder of prominent west berlin judge guenter von drenkmann in 
1974 
von seckendorffgudent is accused of membership in a terrorist 
organization fuchs said that was also the charge in the 
nowexpired warrant against ms duemlein 
von seckendorffgudent was allegedly also a member of the 
infamous baadermeinhof gang in west germany an early 1970s 
forerunner of the red army faction 
lotze and ms helbing also are accused of robbing a bank of 
120000 in the west german city of nuernberg in april 1979 
hansjuergen foerster a spokesman for the west german federal 
prosecutors office in karlsruhe said a 1978 warrant issued for 
ms duemlein expired two years ago 
western officials have long contended that the former communist 
regime either endorsed trained or condoned leftist terrorism 
the former secret police known as the stasi one of the most 
skilled and feared intelligence networks in the world is believed 
to have trained the secret services of several other countries and 
people linked to terrorism

gen george s pattons 2nd armored 
division helped win the battle of the bulge but now it has lost 
the battle of the budget 
the army has decided to deactivate the unit ending its colorful 
history as the armored division with the longest active service 
record formed in july 1940 for european service in world war ii 
the division is being dismantled 50 years later in anticipation of 
european peace 
this division has the most glorious history of any combat unit 
in the us army lt charles macmaster at fort hood said 
thursday 
patton dubbed the division hell on wheels promising it 
would terrify enemies its troops adopted the nickname as their 
motto today its soldiers still proudly wear hell on wheels on 
their division patch 
patton had urged armored units as early as world war i it took 
until just before the outbreak of world war ii though for 
military technology to advance enough to demand tank support units 
for demanding the armored units patton was officially 
reprimanded but his persistence paid off the 2nd armored landed 
on omaha beach pushed through france and was the first allied 
unit to enter belgium 
after moving a record 100 miles in a single night the 2nd 
armored helped win the battle of the bulge in the winter of 1944 
and was the first american unit to enter berlin on july 4 1945 
the division had previously been badly defeated in 1943 when 25 
of its tanks fought with the british in the battle of beja in 
tunisia according to capt jim bolling only one tank survived 
that battle and troops nicknamed it the gallant 
parts of the 2nd armored also participated in the korean and 
vietnam wars one of its most famous soldiers was elvis presley 
who was honored in the 2nd armored war museum at fort hood 
under pressure to cut spending in anticipation of a cutback in 
european troop strength and more warming of superpower relations 
the army announced wednesday that it is deactivating the division 
that means 3537 military jobs will be cut by sept 30 at fort 
hood another 8615 in the division will be cut by the end of 
fiscal year 1991 
the divisions goal supporting us troops in europe is less 
important because as the warsaw pact disintegrates the threat is 
lessened said army spokesman maj joe padilla 
during peacetime army divisions are periodically deactivated 
the united states had a record 84 divisions in service after world 
war ii but now has only 18 active divisions an army spokesman 
said 
the 2nd armored came to central texas in 1946 when fort hood was 
named camp hood 
angry at the prospective loss of military personnel central 
texas residents near fort hood filed a lawsuit in state court to 
try to stop the action the court has not ruled 
it has to hurt i am sure it will said charles j gillen of 
lampasas owner of gillens army surplus 
it might take a little time to notice it but residents will 
gillen said that includes surplus dealers although it will help 
them at first when they will have to sell more there will be an 
oversupply of surplus the government is good about overbuying

a bureaucrat was elected prime minister of the 
russian republic today defeating a reformist ally of the 
federations president boris yeltsin the tass news agency 
reported today 
the new prime minister is ivan silayev who has been a deputy 
prime minister in the cabinet of soviet prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov 
the victory of a man with ties to the government of yeltsins 
rival soviet president mikhail s gorbachev may make it more 
difficult for yeltsin to pursue changes that go beyond gorbachevs 
reform program 
on tuesday the russian parliament led by yeltsin took its first 
step on a path of more radical reform by approving a resolution 
that declared that the republics laws take precedence over soviet 
ones 
silayev won 70 percent of the vote in the russian supreme soviet 
legislature to defeat mikhail bocharov a leader in the democratic 
russia bloc along with yeltsin and a factory manager who has led 
experiments with leasing his company from the state tass said 
silayev 60 is a mechanical engineer by training who started 
his career at the gorky aircraft factory tass said 
he moved up to minister of the aircraft industry and then 
became minister of the machine tool and instrumentmaking industry 
he became a deputy prime minister of the soviet union in 1985 and 
now heads a bureau that coordinates the actions of four 
machinetool ministries 
yeltsins reform drive is important to gorbachevs because the 
federation contains more than threequarters of the nations land 
including moscow and about 80 percent of the soviet unions people 
are russian

soviet president mikhail gorbachev has been 
contending with weighty problems like secessionist republics 
warring ethnic groups and a crumbling economy on friday he coped 
with a more common ailment a cold 
gorbachev worked at home and stayed in touch by telephone said 
anatoly lukyanov chairman of the supreme soviet legislature 
lukyanov joked that some dreary weather during gorbachevs trip 
to the united states 12 days for a superpower summit ago might be 
to blame for his little cold 
moscow also has been chilly and rainy for more than a week 
it seems your american climate and ours coincided lukyanov 
told reporters 
lukyanov did not specify what gorbachev was working on at home 
but the russian communist party congress is next week and gorbachev 
is expected to give an address 
there was no indication that gorbachevs ailment was anything 
more than just what soviet officials said it was 
back in the preglasnost days when aging soviet leaders were 
out of sight for months suffering from serious illnesses official 
statements would sometimes say they had a cold 
at 59 gorbachev is the youngest and most vigorous soviet leader 
in years 
gregor gysi chairman of east germanys party of democratic 
socialism had been scheduled to meet with gorbachev on friday he 
told a moscow news conference that the two had talked by telephone 
instead 
i have just talked on the phone and i wished a speedy recovery 
to my colleague and i wished him to go back to his work as soon as 
possible gysi said he caught a cold but i know that he is 
feeling better 
although the official english translator described the illness 
as a cold east germanys news agency adn apparently based on 
gysis original comment in german quoted him as saying it was an 
infection 
gysi met thursday with alexander yakovlev a member of the 
ruling politburo instead of with gorbachev 
gorbachev appeared healthy tuesday a long and grueling day for 
him 
he gave a major speech to the legislature in the morning in the 
afternoon he met with the presidents of the 15 republics and 
offered a plan to transform the country into a looser union of 
sovereign states in the evening he offered separate 
compromise deals to leaders of the independenceminded baltic 
states 
the next day he wasnt feeling too well 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene was quoted as 
saying gorbachev had begged off attending her meeting in the 
kremlin with soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov on wednesday he

president bush vetoed a bill easing 
51yearold curbs on offduty political activity by government 
workers friday saying the measure could lead to political 
exploitation and abuse 
casting the 12th veto of his presidency two days after the 
senate upheld the 11th bush said there was no compelling reason to 
modify the hatch act 
the hatch act has upheld the integrity of the civil service by 
assuring that federal employees are hired and promoted based upon 
their qualifications and not their political loyalties he said 
in a veto message to congress 
robert tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union representing federal employes in 16 agencies and 
departments called the veto wrongheaded and urged the senate 
to override it 
although the measure passed both chambers by more than the 
twothirds majorities needed to sustain a veto republican leaders 
have said they expect to be able to switch enough votes in the 
senate to sustain the veto 
bush has yet to have a veto overridden just wednesday the 
senate by a twovote margin upheld his veto of a 2 billion amtrak 
authorization bill 
the hatch act revision would affect 3 million federal employees 
and postal workers who are now prohibited from participating in 
any form of political activity beyond voting 
sent to bush by a 33487 house vote on wednesday the bill would 
allow government employees to work in political campaigns on their 
own time hold office in a political party and attend political 
conventions 
however the measure would leave intact prohibitions against 
running for partisan political office and soliciting money from the 
public 
sponsors said the measure would extend some of the same 
fundamental freedoms now enjoyed by most americans to federal and 
postal workers 
but bush said he was opposed to any tinkering with the hatch 
act passed in 1939 to prevent depressionera government workers 
from being pressured to work for president franklin d roosevelts 
reelection effort 
bush said the easing would inevitably lead to repoliticizing 
the government bureaucracy 
it has been manifestly successful over the years in shielding 
civil servants and the programs they administer from political 
exploitation and abuse bush wrote 
we cannot afford in the final decade of this century to 
embark on a retreat into the very worst aspects of public 
administration from the last century he said 
tobias the federal union official urged lawmakers to hold 
fast to their commitment to federal workers 
he said in a statement senators must maintain their 
courageous support of reform and not trade their collective 
conscience for white house cufflinks or breakfast with bush 
the senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 6730 
that would be just enough for a veto override but gop senate 
leaders have expressed confidence they can persuade one or two of

the iranian government has banned the 
countrys only remaining legal opposition party after arresting 
eight of its members an exiled iranian group said friday 
the reported actions against the freedom movement led by former 
prime minister mehdi bazargan signaled the final crushing of any 
organized domestic opposition to the clericled government 
a ruling by the revolutionary prosecutor in tehran declared the 
group illegal according to ali safavi spokesman in baghdad for 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors an iranian 
opposition group based in iraq 
there was no immediate confirmation from irans official news 
agency monitored in cyprus 
iranian state television reported thursday night that eight of 
bazargans associates had been arrested the report said those 
arrested held secret foreign contacts and acted against irans 
interests during the eightyear gulf war against iraq that ended in 
august 1988 it gave no other details 
among those detained was bazargans son whose name was not 
given and ezzatollah sahabi a former planning minister under 
bazargan the mujahedeen said bazargan apparently has not been 
arrested 
bazargan a frencheducated engineer who was jailed by shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi was selected prime minister by iranian 
spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on feb 23 1979 a 
few days after the revolution 
but his moderate policies seeking gradual social and economic 
reforms caused him to fall in disfavor with the fundamentalists 
accused by his opponents of being proamerican he resigned two 
days after militants seized the us embassy in tehran in november 
1979 
since then bazargans small freedom movement has been allowed 
to function as a token opposition party with some freedom to 
criticize iranian authorities the freedom movement demanded that 
khomeini end the bloody war with iraq 
all other opposition groups were brutally suppressed mainly 
during the early postrevolutionary years when the tudeh or 
communist party and other leftist groups were crushed 
bazargans main political action has been to circulate periodic 
letters critical of government policies 
about a month ago bazargan and about 90 others signed an open 
letter to president hashemi rafsanjani calling for restoration of 
constitutional rights 
the letter condemned the government for trampling on civil 
liberties and accused it of economic mismanagement and isolating 
iran internationally 
the letter said the country is on the verge of an abyss and 
that none of the principles of freedom justice and independence 
have been fulfilled 
what you have produced for the poor are slogans and empty 
stomachs said the letter which condemned the government for 
unemployment rising prices and the squandering of billions of 
dollars in oil income 
after the letter was made public khomeinis successor as 
spiritual leader ali khamenei criticized the bazargan group

it was built against the odds in 1940 
and saved from destruction 25 years ago now a lovingly preserved 
frank lloyd wright house faces a new threat shifting ground is 
tearing it apart 
and it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to save the 
house which was built for 7000 
in 1963 the spare little house in thenrural falls church lay 
in the path of progress interstate 66 the homes owner and the 
national trust for historic preservation teamed up to move the 
house board by board to a similarly wooded site several miles 
away on the grounds of the trusts woodlawn plantation 
that act of salvage could lead to the homes eventual 
deterioration 
the popeleighey house built in 1940 and named for its first 
and second owners was rebuilt in 1964 on a seam of highly unstable 
clay to make matters worse fill dirt was used atop the clay seam 
its fair to say when the house was moved and reconstructed 
we didnt know as much as we do today popeleighey director 
linda cunningham goldstein said 
cracks more than an inch wide snake through the concrete floors 
smaller cracks are visible in the walls of one bedroom 
the national trust has considered numerous ideas for saving the 
house a second time engineers and trust officials have largely 
ruled out another move 
every time you rebuild something you lose something ms 
goldstein said we have to think very carefully about it if we 
were to construct it a third time 
instead engineers likely will try to stabilize the foundation 
perhaps using steel rods or plates ms goldstein said she expects 
a decision within a few weeks 
the project could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but 
there is no reliable estmate yet ms goldstein said a fundaising 
arm of the nonprofit trust will make a public appeal for the 
house ms goldstein said 
the brick cypress and glass house was built for loren b pope 
a young washington newspaperman who told wright he made 50 a week 
there are certain things a man wants during life and of 
life material things and things of the spirit the writer has one 
fervent wish that includes both it is for a house created by 
you pope wrote in august 1939 
two weeks later wright replied of course i am ready to give 
you a house 
wright credited with remaking 20th century american 
architecture was already famous and highly controversial when pope 
made his appeal popes infatuation with the modern architect was 
not shared by washington banks which refused to lend pope money to 
build the house 
in the end the washington star where pope worked as an editor 
lent him the money to build the house he lived there six years 
pope who is now 80 and runs a research service for prospective 
college students is aiding fundraising efforts by appearing in a 
documentary filmed at the house this spring 
the wright house is a very central part of my life it was a 
real adventure for a guy making just 50 a week and no safety nets 
at all pope said in a telephone interview from his washington 
office 
it was like living in a work of art he said 
the 1250squarefoot singlestory home features wrights 
trademark flat cantilevered roofs and simple exterior a 
cantilever over the driveway forms what was believed to be the 
worlds first carport 
of course its worth saving its a prime example of wrights 
usonian ideas its really a unique thing university of 
virginia architecture professor and wright scholar richard g 
wilson said 
usonian was wrights term for a philosophy of affordable 
family housing entirely different from traditional rectangular 
styles 
it is the only usonian home open to the public on the east 
coast ms goldstein said 
it is very small on square footage but very big on ideas 
she said there are no little separate spaces for doing this or 
that there is instead the one central living area wright really 
envisioned the family as a family living in very close proximity

iran removed one of the biggest 
obstacles to renewed trade with the united states on friday by 
agreeing to pay a us oil company 600 million for facilities 
seized during the 1979 islamic revolution 
two claims totaling 600 million were awarded to the american 
oil giant amoco said an official of the iranunited states claims 
tribunal it was the biggest settlement in the arbitration bodys 
nineyear history 
the tehran government has hinted recently that the resolution of 
financial disputes with the united states might contribute to the 
release of the six american hostages held by proiranian shiite 
extremists in lebanon 
last month settlement of a much smaller claims package was 
announced shortly after the release of american hostages robert 
polhill and frank reed 
american and iranian officials at the tribunal have vigorously 
denied conducting any direct talks on the hostage issue they said 
the tribunal deals only with arbitration of financial disputes 
the amoco settlement was among more than 18 billion in oil 
company claims stemming from irans islamic revolution led by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
usiranian ties were severed over the holding of hostages at 
the united states embassy in tehran for 444 days by iranian 
militants 
the tribunal official in a telephone interview repeated our 
strong position that the arbitration is not tied to the fate of 
the american hostages in lebanon 
at issue in fridays settlement were two claims filed by amoco 
subsidiaries against the national iranian oil company according to 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with 
tribunal policy 
the amoco iran oil co is receiving 540 million worth of 
compensation for the seizure of four persian gulf drilling fields 
and the oil terminal on kharg island which is irans most 
important oil terminal 
the amoco international finance corp is to receive 60 million 
for the expropriation of a petrochemical processing plant on kharg 
the official said 
iran derives 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings from 
oil exports and president hashemi rafsanjani has been making 
efforts recently to improve and expand trade with the west 
however he has faced strong opposition from islamic militants 
who want nothing to do with the united states 
until friday a 116 million award made in 1986 to the sedco 
firm had been the biggest single settlement by the tribunal since 
its 1981 inception according to the official the firm built 
drilling platforms in iran before the revolution 
the tribunal was set up as part of the 1980 algiers accord 
which helped win the freedom of the embassy hostages 
the panel has three american judges three iranians and three 
thirdnation members so far it has settled 32 billion worth of 
governmenttogovernment and private claims 
approximately 150 such claims are still pending according to 
the tribunal official who could not specify their total worth 
the biggest item still on the tribunals agenda is an 11 
billion claim filed by iran for military equipment ordered before 
the revolution and not delivered under the subsequent us embargo 
the us government contends that much of the weaponry at issue 
is not under its control but belongs to private contractors whose 
bills were never paid by tehran 
washington claims that the some of the hardware iran did pay for 
was sold to private buyers and the proceeds deposited in irans 
bank accounts 
among those items were four warships taken over by the us 
navy the us government has said

democrats pressed president bush on friday to 
sign a bill guaranteeing workers emergency family leave quoting 
1988 candidate george bush to support their arguments against his 
threatened veto 
the republican sponsor of the bill also urged bush to sign it 
saying a veto on such a bedrock family issue could backfire for 
the gop 
the family leave bill went to the white house after the senate 
approved it thursday evening on a voice vote 
bush did not respond to a question about it during a photo 
session friday but press secretary marlin fitzwater said yes 
when asked if bush would veto the bill 
white house officials have said bush does support flexible 
family leave policies by all employers but believes they should 
not be mandated by government 
the bills main republican sponsor rep marge roukema rnj 
urged bush not to act until she and other backers could meet with 
him she said a veto would leave the republican party open to 
charges it is insensitive to working families 
the point that has to be considered here is do we want to be 
perceived as the party that fights for a reduction in the capital 
gains tax while we turn our backs on taxpaying hardworking 
american families who are in medical crisis she said 
the bill passed comfortably in the house last month although 
the margin fell 46 votes short of the twothirds majority that 
would be needed to override a veto 
senate passage came without a recorded vote sponsor christopher 
dodd dconn said he was within two or three votes of a 
twothirds majority 
bush has vetoed 12 bills so far and hasnt been overridden on 
any 
the new legislation would require business and government 
employers to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical 
leave or with leave so they could care for a newly born or adopted 
child or an ill child parent or spouse 
employers would have to continue health coverage and then 
restore a returning employee to his or her previous job or an 
equivalent position 
seemingly confident the bill has broad public support democrats 
taunted bush with his own campaign rhetoric 
at a news conference friday senate majority leader george 
mitchell read from a campaign speech bush made to a republican 
womens group in illinois in fall 1988 while bush was running for 
president 
he quoted bush we also need to assure that women dont have 
to worry about getting their jobs back after having a child or 
caring for a child during a serious illness this is what i meant 
when i talked about a gentler nation 
those are mr bushs words before he became president 
mitchell said now its up to the president to live up to his 
words 
democrats saw the issue as raising family values in a way that 
favors them politically at a time when many are under attack for 
opposing bushs constitutional amendment against flag burning 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo described bush as wrapping 
himself in the flag and coming out against parenthood 
the bill would cover about half of all us workers and is 
strongly opposed by business groups 
it exempts businesses with fewer than 50 employees and the 
highestpaid 10 percent within a company 
roukema and several other supporters cited their own experiences 
during debate 
roukema said she was fortunate enough to be able to stay at home 
when her child was dying of leukemia sen edward kennedy dmass 
said he was able to leave the senate for prolonged periods when his 
son teddy was stricken with cancer 
dodd recalled that bush cited a similar experience as well the 
death of one of his young children during a 1988 debate with 
democratic nominee michael dukakis 
certainly having lived through that experience he knows what 
its like to be in the midst of a family crisis dodd said 
that goes on every minute of every day in this country for 
thousands and thousands of families 
roukema said she had received no response from the white house 
despite repeated requests for a meeting with bush and chief of 
staff john sununu who pledged to business lobbyists last month 
that bush would veto the bill 
i fully expect that the president will give we republicans who 
support this bill the courtesy of a meeting prior to any action 
she said im appealing to him that he not take any action until 
he hears from people like myself

the soviet union has urged the western 
allies to begin negotiations this fall to get rid of shortrange 
nuclear weapons in europe nato officials said friday 
but alliance diplomats immediately dismissed the suggestion 
saying bargaining on nuclear arms should take place only after 
agreement on an accord to reduce tanks artillery and other 
conventional weapons in europe 
we will stick to our timetable said one diplomat who 
demanded anonymity this is the logical way to proceed first 
things first 
the kremlin has in the past pressed the western nations for 
early talks on nuclear weapons and sources said did so again this 
week in a proposal to the united states in washington 
the soviet union proposed to the united states to start 
negotiations on the elimination of snf shortrange nuclear forces 
in the autumn of this year said florent swijsen spokesman for 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
he said the offer would be discussed by president bush and other 
alliance leaders at a summit july 56 in london 
under the proposal the soviet union wants to negotiate the 
elimination not only of landbased nuclear arms in europe but also 
airlaunched systems the sources said 
it also would like to bring frances independent nuclear arsenal 
into the talks they said france belongs to nato but remains 
outside its joint military structure 
the issue of shortrange nuclear weapons in europe has become 
increasingly controversial with the easing of tensions between nato 
and the sovietled warsaw pact 
the wests battlefield weapons most based in west germany 
would hit targets in nowfriendly countries in eastern europe the 
term shortrange is applied to weapons with ranges of less than 
about 300 miles 
the western allies have agreed that there is a diminishing 
need for shortrange nuclear arms in their arsenal bush earlier 
this year cancelled us plans to build a more powerful version of 
the lance shortrange missile and a modernized 155mm nucleartipped 
artillery shell 
even so the allies have continued to insist the western defense 
requires an appropriate mix of conventional and nuclear arms 
for the foreseeable future 
with a reduction in landbased forces analysts expect nato to 
put more emphasis on airlaunched nuclear systems the united 
states is developing a tactical airtosurface missile tasm 
which would replace gravity bombs a west german official said last 
week however that the bonn government did not want the new 
weapons based on its territory 
nato foreign ministers last week agreed at a meeting in scotland 
to support a bush suggestion for a speedier timetable for 
negotiations on shortrange nuclear forces they said those talks 
could begin shortly after a conventional arms accord was 
concluded 
at a may 1989 summit bush and the other leaders had linked the 
bargaining to implementation of the treaty 
nato diplomats reiterated their latest position 
we have got to complete the cfe conventional armed forces in 
europe agreement and then get on with it said one official who 
like the others demanded anonymity theres enough to digest 
before we get on with snf he said 
another diplomat said the conventional arms talks were quite 
complicated and added we shouldnt complicate them further 
with new topics of negotiation 
a spokesman for the us mission to nato speaking on condition 
of anonymity said we note the continuing large imbalance in 
soviet shortrange nuclear weapons elimination of this imbalance 
is long overdue 
the united states is prepared to enter into talks for the 
reduction of shortrange nuclear systems as soon as the cfe talks 
are completed he said 
the 16 nato nations and the seven of the warsaw pact have said 
they want to strike a conventional arms deal this year although 
western officials have complained about soviet footdragging 
on thursday diplomats in vienna said the two sides were close 
to agreement on overall limits for tanks and armored combat 
vehicles in europe 
moscow and washington already have agreed to limit their 
stationed forces in central europe to 195000 on each side the 
united states would retain an additional 30000 troops in britain 
and southern europe

retail prices rose a modest 02 percent in 
may easing the strain on consumers budgets for the second 
straight month after a painful spurt in prices early in the year 
the government said friday 
in other economic news the commerce department said the us 
trade deficit shrank to 694 billion in april the second lowest 
level in the last six years 
and the federal reserve said industrial production rebounded an 
unexpectedly strong 06 percent last month after holding steady in 
april 
the april and may moderation in the labor departments consumer 
price index curbed inflation for the first five months of the year 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 58 percent 
thats up significantly from the 46 percent rate for all of 
last year but down sharply from the worrisome 85 percent rate in 
the first quarter 
inflation remains low and under control said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the better news on inflation was expected by most economists 
who said prices are recovering from weatherrelated increases for 
food energy and clothing prices for fuel oil and vegetables shot 
up in january and february in reaction to an unusually severe 
freeze around christmas 
after that a warm spell stimulated early sales of more 
expensive spring clothing lines sending apparel costs higher 
what you need to keep in mind here is that the moderation in 
may is mainly an unwinding of the price spikes you got earlier in 
the year said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch 
although we should be happy to get these kinds of numbers they 
are probably understating inflation just as the numbers at the 
beginning of the year were overstating it 
food prices rose only 01 percent last month after falling 02 
percent a month earlier energy costs dropped 07 percent the 
fourth monthly decline following a large increase in january 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors often 
taken as a better barometer of underlying inflation than the 
overall calculation of prices rose a moderate 03 percent after 
increasing 02 percent a month earlier 
the various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 
1292 in may that means a hypothetical selection of goods and 
services costing 100 in the 198284 base period would have cost 
12920 last month up from 12380 a year ago 
the recent mild inflation meant that americans average weekly 
earnings after adjusting for inflation increased 03 percent in 
may still for the last 12 months earnings fell 01 percent 
average weekly earnings in may before adjusting for inflation 
were 34431 up from 33086 a year earlier 
both the 17 percent improvement in the trade gap and the 
moderation of inflation were taken by analysts as a sign of a weak 
domestic economy which translates into lower demand for imports 
and lower prices for goods in general 
the industrial production report although a sign of strength 
was considered somewhat of a fluke much of it was attributed to a 
buildup in inventories by the big three automakers worried about a 
strike in september 
opinion was mixed over whether economic weakness will prompt the 
federal reserve to nudge shortterm interest rates lower bond 
prices plunged after the reports a sign that traders believed the 
economy was not weak enough nor inflation calm enough to trigger an 
easier monetary policy 
but steinberg noting the long lag between a change in policy 
and a corresponding reaction in the economy said it seems to me 
the fed if it doesnt want to see the economy weaken further will 
have to ease sometime in the near future probably in july 
the department offered these other details of may consumer 
prices 
fruit and vegetable costs fell 24 percent their third 
substantial drop in a row vegetable prices soared 292 percent in 
the first two months of the year before falling 236 percent in the 
next three months dairy costs fell for the third consecutive month 
while prices were up for sweets fats and oils and beverages 
fuel oil costs declined 14 percent natural gas 27 percent 
electricity charges rose 1 percent gasoline prices rose modestly 
but less than usual for the start of the warm weather driving 
season thus after seasonal adjustment gasoline prices were 
reported down 16 percent 
clothing costs fell 03 percent prices for mens clothing rose 
04 percent but the cost of womens and childrens clothing fell 1 
percent and 22 percent respectively 
new car prices edged down 02 percent their fourth consecutive 
decline in the face of sluggish sales 
the price of medical care jumped 08 percent in may for the 
fourth consecutive month pushing those costs 9 percent higher than 
a year ago

the worlds two largest 
goldproducing companies said friday they were curtailing 
operations due to the falling price of gold more than 7800 people 
were to lose their jobs as a result 
angloamerican corp of south africa ltd said two of its mining 
companies free state state consolidated gold mines ltd 
freegold and vaal reefs exploration and mining co ltd would 
cut back on their operations 
earlier this week two other mining groups outside the 
angloamerican conglomerate announced job cutbacks involving 1100 
workers 
gold is south africas major industry earning more than half 
the countrys foreign currency 
lionel hewitt managing director of angloamericans gold and 
uranium division said the company had made efforts in recent months 
to maintain existing levels of operation including costreduction 
measures and deferment of expenditures 
despite these efforts at current gold prices and operating 
costs certain mining areas are now incapable of sustaining mining 
operations at their present levels hewitt said 
the price of gold reached a fouryear low of 34625 per ounce 
in new york and london before recovering thursday it was trading 
at 34750 per ounce in new york on friday afternoon 
hewitt said the cutback would take place over the next nine 
months and probably result in the loss of 7800 jobs at freegold 
he said reducing operations at vaal reefs would not necessarily 
involve loss of jobs because workers may be assigned to other 
areas of the mine 
vaal reefs has greater flexibility in the opening of new ore 
reserves than freegold hewitt said 
on wednesday general mining union corp announced its marginal 
operation stilfontein gold mining co ltd would lay off 500 
workers immediately to cut costs in the face of the low gold price 
anglovaal ltd said its loraine gold mines ltd would lay off 600 
workers and reduce production by 10 percent during the next four 
months 
hewitt said angloamerican management had invited discussions 
with union leaders about the curtailments there was no immediate 
reaction from the unions 
the national union of mineworkers the nations largest black 
union representing some 250000 black miners has already declared 
a dispute and asked for arbitration in its annual wage negotiations 
with the mining industry 
south africa has the deepest gold mines in the world and the 
cost of mining increases with the depth 
the relatively cheap labor with an average black miner earning 
from 300 to 400 per month is one reason why south african mines 
can continue to be profitable at great depths 
curtailing mining operations is considered a serious step 
because once a particular shaft is shut down the infrastructure 
often deteriorates rapidly that would make it costly and dangerous 
to start up again when the price of gold rises

top soviet leaders declared friday they had won 
legislative support for a market economy despite rejection of an 
immediate price increase for bread and demands for a more detailed 
blueprint of the transition 
comments by the head of soviet economic planning and the 
chairman of the legislature both members of the communist party 
politburo reflected the governments shaky approach to reform 
despite months of study 
the government program presented by premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
last month caused panic buying that left halfempty store shelves 
even barer 
yuri d maslyukov the chairman of the state planning 
commission told reporters friday that the supreme soviet 
legislature was right to posptone the first phase of a bread price 
increase ryzhkov proposed for july 1 
the opinion of the government is that probably considering 
the importance of the matter the decision of the session is 
correct maslyukov said we will look into that matter one more 
time because a mistake would cost it the confidence of the 
people 
bread is the staple of the soviet diet and prices have remained 
unchanged for decades 
but president mikhail s gorbachev pushing for the economic 
reform program told soviets on the eve of his summit trip to 
washington that bread is so cheap that children sometimes use 
loaves for soccer balls at the same time the soviet government is 
forced to use up precious hard currency reserves to ensure there is 
enough grain by importing it he said 
maslyukov and supreme soviet chairman anatoly i lukyanov a 
gorbachev protege who fulfills many of the functions of a vice 
president held news conferences friday a day after the 
legislature finished its spring session to give the governments 
evaluation 
the president and the government have been granted the right 
to make necessary decisions to prepare the transition to a market 
economy maslyukov said 
both acknowledged that the government economic plan required 
more work 
it has become clear that new models arent created on the run 
with one wave of the hand lukyanov said time is needed and 
to take into account many other factors and to weigh all the 
details and to think 
its a new revolution in principle of course it needs 
perfecting he said 
the plan presented by ryzhkov had been in the works for months 
but after two weeks of debate the supreme soviet told the 
government to come back with more detailed plans when it reconvenes 
in september 
the plan calls for food prices to be doubled jan 1 rapid 
conversion of stateowned enterprises to stock companies and the 
gradual sale of stocks to the public it would permit certain 
companies and industries to contract directly for their supplies 
and to sell their products in a free market unprofitable firms 
would go bankrupt 
maslyukov reiterated that the country probably would have its 
first nationwide referendum on the economic package but only after 
more detailed plans are presented to the supreme soviet in the fall 
the legislature must approve the plan before it is presented for 
a referendum which likely will include two main questions the 
speed of economic reform and the methods of compensating consumers 
for the higher costs 
asked about another key area of economic change monetary 
reform maslyukov said the soviet ruble would have to be devalued 
several times to bring it closer to market values 
to make the currency convertible on the world market the 
government must drastically cut its budget deficit he said that 
means reducing spending on capital construction defense and 
foreign aid maslyukov said 
by 1993 government plans call for foreign firms to be able to 
reinvest in the soviet union rubles they have earned in the 
country and by 1995 for the ruble to be convertible 
but other soviet economic officials have said that such 
predictions of full convertibility are too optimistic deputy 
premier leonid a abalkin has said that it likely will take many 
years to make the ruble convertible

the chairmen of two congressional committees 
urged energy secretary james d watkins on friday to take new steps 
to improve safety practices at the savannah river nuclear arms 
plant before allowing it to resume operation 
watkins should insist that operators of savannah rivers nuclear 
reactors which make tritium gas for nuclear warheads meet the 
safety standards of the commercial nuclear industry said sen john 
glenn dohio and rep mike synar doklahoma 
it is critical to change the disturbing mindset of 
complacency that has been embedded at the savannah river plant for 
many years glenn said the energy department still has a long 
way to go 
the legislators were responding to a report by the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress that said the 
savannah river operation had not yet made sufficient improvements 
in safety practices and attitudes 
the gao report said that under current energy department plans 
the reactor operators at savannah river would not be required to 
meet commercial industry training standards prior to restart 
the report recommended that watkins require westinghouse 
savannah river co which runs the plant for the government to 
carry out a comprehensive plan for changing the safety culture 
there before it resumes reactor operation 
the plant is on a 315squaremile federal reservation near 
aiken sc 
the report also said that efforts to further improve safety 
practices and attitudes in addition to several other management 
and environmental issues could delay the planned restart of 
savannah river reactors by as much as two years 
watkins has said he hopes to have the first of the three active 
savannah river reactors back in operation by january although no 
final restart date has been set the reactors are the nations only 
source of tritium a radioactive gas that must be replenished in 
warheads because it decays at a rate of 55 percent a year 
the reactors were closed down in 1988 because of safety 
mechanical and management problems 
last week two environmental groups the natural resources 
defense council of new york and the energy research foundation of 
columbia sc filed suit in federal court in aiken challenging 
watkins plan for restarting the reactors 
the suit demanded that restart be blocked until the department 
completes construction of a cooling tower for reactor discharges 
or until president bush exempts the plant from the clean water act 
on national security grounds the tower is scheduled for completion 
in 1992

east german police said friday they arrested 
four west german fugitives striking a major blow to the core of 
west germanys leftist terrorist movement 
all four were arrested late thursday one was later freed 
because charges against her had expired it was not certain whether 
west germany would file the charges again 
the east german government initially said it also had captured 
three other wanted fugitives but retracted that statement late 
friday 
the three people arrested today in leipzig are not the hunted 
red army faction terrorists barbara meyer horst ludwig meyer and 
sabine callsen the governmentrun news agency adn said in a 
brief news flash 
it gave no explanation for the earlier incorrect information 
issued by the interior ministry and did not say whether the three 
arrested were even suspected of being involved in terrorist 
activities 
despite the erroneous report the arrests of the four fugitives 
in frankfurt an der oder and cottbus together with two arrests on 
wednesday were significant for west german authorities 
authorities consider the fugitives to be among the leaders of 
the red army faction terror gang which waged a murderous war 
against west german capitalism in the 1970s and 1980s 
all had been living in east germany under assumed names and 
west german officials said the arrests go a long way toward 
confirming longheld suspicions that east germanys former 
communist government once harbored terrorists 
bonn government spokesman hans klein told reporters the federal 
government had indications for several years that east germanys 
former secret police sheltered the fugitives 
klein said however the indications were vague and that west 
germans would have run into an iron wall had they tried to 
raise the issue with the former east german leaders 
in east berlin interior minister petermichael diestel told a 
news conference he was unable to confirm widespread speculation 
that terrorists had used east germany as a base for attacks 
but he promised to seek prosecution of any former officials who 
harbored the terrorists under the communist regime 
in hamburg conservative west german lawmaker eduard lintner 
demanded the extradition of ousted communist leader erich honecker 
to face charges of having supported terrorism 
authorities identified those arrested thursday as monika 
helbing 36 and ekkehard von seckendorffgudent 49 arrested in 
frankfurt an der oder and werner lotze 38 and christine 
duemlein 41 arrested in cottbus 
ms helbing and seckendorffgudent are married as are lotze and 
ms duemlein 
ms helbing and lotze allegedly were involved in the 1977 
kidnapslaying of west german industrialist hannsmartin schleyer 
and numerous other terrorist crimes 
ms duemline was wanted on charges of being a member of a 
terrorist organization to overthrow the state and an arrest 
warrant was issued for her in 1978 it was dropped in 1988 after 
the warrant expired by law and east german officials she was freed 
after her capture because it had not been renewed 
ekkehard von seckendorffgudent was wanted as a red army faction 
sympathiser as a doctor he had a permanent visitors pass to a 
hamburg prison which authorities said he gave to suspected 
terrorists to visit jailed compatriots 
as east germany and west germany move toward unification the 
countries are cooperating closely now west german wanted posters 
are seen throughout the east and other fugitives among two dozen 
hardcore leaders could be arrested 
the retraction late friday leaves the meyers some of west 
germanys mosthunted fugitives 
the couple is accused of a car bomb attack that killed two 
people and wounded 20 others at the us air forces rheinmain air 
base near frankfurt in august 1985

paraguayan president andres rodriguez asked 
president bush for trade benefits friday bush sought increased 
paraguayan efforts on antidrug operations officials said 
the two met briefly in the oval office during a stopover by 
rodriguez en route to taiwan and south korea 
president bush told president rodriguez that we would like to 
cooperate more intensively with paraguay to prevent drug 
traffickers from establishing a foothold in that country said 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
us officials have expressed concern that paraguay is becoming 
an increasingly active transshipment point for drugs produced in 
other south american countries dozens of private airstrips have 
been reported in remote sections of paraguay used by drug 
trafficking planes 
while rodriguez is seen as making some efforts against illegal 
drugs his cooperation so far has not been effective said one 
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
rodriguez asked bush to restore the system of generalized 
special preferences trade benefits for paraguay fitzwater said in 
a statement the gsp is designed to allow thirdworld nations to 
ship their products to the united states duty free or with low 
tariffs 
under us regulations countries that violate basic labor 
rights can be denied the gsp privileges paraguay is among the 
nations to be sanctioned in recent years on such grounds 
in a photo session before their meeting rodriguez expressed 
hopes bush would help his countrys new move toward democracy 
rodriguez a military general was elected last year after he 
overthrew dictator gen alfred stroessner 
i feel very confident that the leader of the worlds 
democracies will help me in paraguay to replant democracy in this 
transitional period that were going through rodriguez told bush 
at the start of their session 
bush said the united states is pleased with this noble 
beginning youve made and watching with great interest as 
paraguay undertakes reforms 
rodriguez later characterized his brief meeting with bush as 
marvelous 
the paraguayan later had lunch with vice president dan quayle 
who visited paraguay in march 
quayle said that during that visit he had pressed rodriguez for 
progress on human rights and labor rights 
a 1990 state department report on human rights in paraguay said 
the rodriguez government has taken significant steps to reverse 
repression that was prevalent under stroessner but greater strides 
are needed 
the report said government corruption remained a problem

israeli leaders said friday they were seeking 
us support to start from the beginning with middle east peace 
initiatives 
the new position emerged as the israelis responded to sharp 
remarks by secretary of state james a baker iii who urged 
israels new rightwing government to move to resume the stalled 
peace process 
baker testifying before a senate committee on wednesday 
recited the telephone number of the white house switchboard and 
said when youre serious about this call us 
but foreign minister david levy said in an interview published 
friday that israel must clarify to the united states that a peace 
move is fateful for us and cannot depend on a yes or no answer 
to one single question 
the question levy referred to was bakers october proposal for a 
preliminary israelipalestinian dialogue in egypt 
the talks would be toward ending the 30monthold palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule of the territories at least 717 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians and 
45 israelis have also died 
the palestinian delegation to any peace talks according to 
baker should include people living in exile and those who have 
homes in both the occupied territories and annexed east jerusalem 
the formula was intended as a compromise between israels 
refusal to talk to the palestine liberation organization and the 
plo demand that palestinians outside the territories be included in 
talks 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs conservative likud bloc fearing 
bakers terms would lead israel to de facto negotiations with the 
plo and raise the issue of jerusalem has failed to give a positive 
answer 
in march likuds coalition with the centerleft labor party 
fell apart over shamirs stalling shamir formed a new government 
monday 
the answer to baker was not negative but we have to remember 
that the train got off the tracks both because of bakers 
questions and because the government fell apart levy told the 
daily yediot ahronot 
therefore you cannot say now we set the train in motion from 
exactly the same spot despite the fact there are no tracks he 
said 
a top shamir aide yossi benaharon said friday we are 
asking to start from the beginning to get the process on a 
track that will not lead us to negotiations with a delegation 
composed by the plo and that will lead us into the danger of a 
palestinian state 
it is unacceptable that they the americans return exactly to 
this point and propose the same questions to the new government 
that has been formed benaharon said on israel army radio 
israel in accordance with its may 1989 peace initiative says 
palestinian representatives should be chosen in elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip the plan also offers 
palestinians an interim period of selfrule with their final 
status to be determined in later negotiations 
baker said wednesday there wont be any dialogue there wont 
be any peace if israels new government makes unacceptable 
demands for palestinian participation in peace talks 
meanwhile dozens of police patrolled east talpiot and two 
neighboring arab villages where the stabbing of an 11yearold 
jewish schoolboy thursday set off antiarab riots no further 
incidents were reported however 
also friday arab writers groups protested the arrest of poet 
shafik habib detained on suspicion that his latest collection of 
poems could incite antiisraeli violence habib was taken from his 
home in the village of deir hana near nazareth on wednesday 
at the united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
on friday deplored the throwing of a teargas grenade by israeli 
forces into a maternity and childrens clinic in the gaza strip 
this week 
in all 57 infants were treated for inhaling tear gas the 
incident occurred when israeli soldiers persuing arab stone 
throwers ran into the un health center

house democrats criticized savings and loan 
bailout officials friday for hiring highpaid consultants keeping 
executives of failed thrifts on the job and continuing to pay 
others who perform no work 
congress is hearing growing reports of overpaid individuals 
running governmentheld institutions of officers from failed 
institutions staying on the government payroll with sixfigure 
salaries said rep bruce vento dminn chairman of the house 
sampl bailout task force 
at a time when it is reported that the total cost to the 
taxpayer is growing at an everincreasing rate why is the 
resolution trust corp continuing these megadollar salaries for a 
work product that at best is mediocre and at worst is a proven 
failure he asked 
vento cited three cases 
two governmentcontrolled thrifts in orange county calif 
mercury savings and western empire savings continued to pay six 
former officers even though they no longer worked for the 
institutions 
wallace associates a salt lake city firm received 500000 to 
manage midwest savings association in minneapolis for a year 
the managing agent at franklin savings association in ottawa 
kan is receiving 220000 for his first six months on the job 
rtc chief executive officer david cooke said that in the 
california institutions top executives were placed on paid 
administrative leave until their thrifts were placed in 
receiverships and their employment contracts could be legally 
broken 
cooke said the agency usually is able to break such contracts 
swiftly but in the case of some large complex institutions must 
maintain them for several months 
some of these sweetheart management deals they cut for 
themselves are almost ironclad legally said michael j 
martinelli the rtcs regional director in kansas city mo 
in the case of midwest savings the consulting firm was 
replacing even higher paid executives martinelli said the manager 
hired for franklin savings was worth his salary because he had the 
expertise necessary to deal with the thrifts complex securities 
portfolio he said 
cooke said top executives were retained at 211 of 351 thrifts 
seized by the government through april 13 of those salaries 
remained unchanged at 124 were lowered at 51 and raised at 36 
salary reductions for top executives at seized thrifts have saved 
taxpayers nearly 35 million he said 
it is important to understand that in many cases the senior 
management in institutions taken into conservatorship are not 
dishonest or incompetent and are not the ones who caused the 
institution to fail he added 
however rep james mcdermott dwash questioned whether any 
employees of a failed thrift above the level of secretary or teller 
should be retained when a new governmentcontrolled thrift is 
created 
the question is are you allowing the virus that took down 
one sampl to move to the next sampl he said

a group of indians from wisconsin tribes told 
county government representatives friday they should negotiate 
settlements to their problems instead of forming a national 
organization to challenge treaties 
to me its sad we cant sit down in our own areas and resolve 
our problems purcell powless chairman of the oneida tribe told 
a meeting run by the wisconsin county association 
whether you like me or not im here and my people are going 
to be here a long time he said 
powless was among 12 tribal representatives who spoke to the 
conference of county officials working to form a national coalition 
on federal indian policy 
i dont believe there is a need for the things they are trying 
to do said joe bresette a chippewa indian and executive 
director of the great lakes intertribal council there is a 
presumption that there is us and them we dont believe that 
trouble erupted at the first meeting of the coalition last 
january in salt lake city because indians were excluded this 
time the coalition organizers complied with the indians desire to 
speak earlier than originally scheduled 
the idea for a coalition arose from a dispute between the 
chippewa indians in wisconsin and 20 counties over timber rights 
the indians say federal treaties give them the right to harvest on 
18 million acres of land the counties claim 
the case is pending in federal court with briefs due june 26 
from both sides on whether the treaties should be reopened 
mark rogacki executive director of the wisconsin county 
association said the dispute led his group to contact counties in 
other states with similar problems 
there are common threads of indian policy that run through the 
country said rogacki we want federal government officials 
to conduct hearings all across the nation to find out what the 
problems are 
he said the issues now in courts could be eliminated if congress 
adjusted the treaties 
eighteen county representatives from five states were at the 
conference which was called to discuss how to get the national 
association of counties to make the coalition a part of its 
activities said rogacki 
rita kenshena tribal attorney for the menominee tribe said she 
and the other indians hoped to stress the need to work locally to 
settle the disputes 
the indian tribes are more informed about their governments 
and treaties than the county officials she said 
keith ferris chairman of the conference said he planned to ask 
the tribes in wisconsin whether they would be willing to 
reestablish a local board that brought together county and tribal 
leaders to discuss the various problems that arise

the agriculture department said friday it has 
issued a permit for the first field trials in the united states of 
genetically engineered corn 
the permit clears the way for biotechnica agriculture inc of 
overland park kan to begin its tests this month in lisbon iowa 
said james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service 
glosser said the tests will continue through the summer and that 
the companys procedures were designed carefully so as not to 
disturb the environment 
the corn being tested differes from standard seed only in that 
it contains genetic marker genes these will allow scientists to 
map more exactly the locations on chromosomes of genes that 
determine the corns characteristics including yield and 
resistance to diseases 
once the genes are located researchers can manipulate and 
eventually introduce them into new corn varieties and other crops 
as well 
glosser said biotechnia scientists already have examined the 
experimental corn plants in the greehouse and want to repeat the 
studies under field conditions 
the corn project follows announcement earlier this week of 
similar field trials for soybeans and rice 
monsanto agricultural co of st louis won approval for field 
tests of generically engineered soybeans this summer in arkansas 
georgia illinois indiana iowa kentucky missouri nebraska 
ohio tennessee and virginia 
those experiments are being conducted to test soybean tolerance 
to the widely used herbicide glyphosate also known commercially as 
roundup 
scientists at louisiana state university in baton rouge are 
testing rice that has been altered so its genes can be mapped for 
later manipulation and use in new varieties

moslem fundamentalists said friday their 
victory in this weeks local elections marks a first step toward 
taking power but they appealed to supporters to guard against 
trouble from enemies of islam 
many algerians abandoned western garb for traditional dress 
friday and some fundamentalists entered bars and restaurants to 
tell owners to curtail alcohol sales in the wake of tuesdays 
election gains 
the leader of the victorious islamic salvation front sheikh 
abassi madani denies his party is fundamentalist however it 
backs the imposition of islamic law in algeria where rule has been 
secular 
after the vote hundreds of fundamentalists celebrated all night 
in algiers the capital they paraded through the streets with 
banners reading god is great and islamic republic 
the army and people are with you madani youths shouted 
madani at a prayer service friday attended by about 30000 
people said algeria had taken the first step on the path toward 
an islamic solution 
however the fronts no 2 official ali belhadj told 
worshipers that ultimate victory depended on vigilance at all 
times against the enemies of islam in algeria and abroad 
especially in france he did not identify them 
his movements unexpectedly strong victory alarmed many moslem 
moderates at home in france and elsewhere france was the colonial 
ruler of this north african nation until it became independent in 
1962 and tuesdays elections were the countrys first multiparty 
voting 
belhadj said algerians who opposed the front should move to 
france 
rightwing french leaders have warned the fronts victory will 
lead to a mass exodus of algerian refugees to france where 
millions of north africans already live 
in algiers several dozen human rights and womens rights 
activists announced friday the formation of a coalition the new 
forum for democracy will work to protect civil liberties and 
ensure a full civic role for women its leaders said 
the islamic front relegates women to a subservient role none of 
its candidates were women 
many algerians who normally wear western clothing appeared on 
the streets friday in traditional garb men in floorlength shirts 
called khamisses and women wearing veils and scarves 
khadija messaoudi a founder of the new rights coalition and 
president of a womens group said many women donned the 
traditional clothing in order to go out in the streets without 
harassment 
madani has said women will not be forced to wear the islamic 
scarf or hijab but his followers have steadily pressured female 
students and teachers to adopt the traditional garb 
though fundamentalists seized power in the 1979 islamic 
revolution in iran many arab states suppress their fundamentalist 
movements irans official media has cheered the algerian win 
saying in this favorable terrain islam can spread very 
quickly 
pressing a bid for political power in algeria madani has asked 
the government to dissolve parliament and hold early elections he 
has also suggested a coalition with the ruling national liberation 
front 
officials have not responded to either request 
madani told journalists friday his party if it won legislative 
elections would be willing to operate under president chadli 
bendjedid whose fiveyear term expires at the end of 1993 
madani has not ruled out the possibility that he would seek the 
presidency his party won 60 percent of the municipal councils at 
stake in tuesdays elections

the west german government fighting an 
outbreak of ira violence said friday it has thwarted a number of 
planned attacks by the terrorist group 
the announcement came the same day the irish republican army 
claimed responsibility for an explosion thursday that damaged an 
unoccupied building at a british army training center near hameln 
west germany no one was hurt in that blast 
on june 2 the ira shot and killed a british army major in 
dortmund west germany 
we must concentrate on trying to prevent such attacks in the 
past few weeks we have succeeded in preventing a number of further 
attacks planned by the ira interior minister wolfgang schauble 
told european community justice and interior ministers they were 
in dublin for a twoday meeting 
schauble refused to give details of the foiled attacks but he 
said improved cooperation between police forces on the european 
continent that had curbed the iras activities 
i am sure and convinced that the leeway for the ira on the 
continent is getting smaller and the search pressure which emanates 
not only from the germans but also from our neighboring countries 
belgium and the netherlands is very high he said the fact 
that we have succeeded in preventing a number of attacks in recent 
weeks shows that our cooperation is working 
the 12nation european community ministers has passed a 
terrorism prevention plan that includes hot pursuit across 
borders a central computer for collecting intelligence and 
improved security at airports train stations and ferry ports 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland and unite the 60 percent protestant province 
with the 95 percent catholic irish republic many of its attacks 
are in northern ireland and britain but it has often attacked 
british targets in western europe as well 
in fridays announcement the ira also claimed responsibility 
for a bomb at a mansion in rural england that belonged to lord 
mcalpin formerly a leading member of the governing conservative 
party no one was hurt in that blast on tuesday 
at fridays meeting of the socalled trevi group the european 
ministers also agreed set up a central drug intelligence unit in 
europe to fight international trafficking

security efforts in the european community

serbia complained friday of bias in belgrade tv coverage of an 
anticommunist rally and demanded criminal charges be brought

the warsaw pact admitted past errors 
including the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia and the soviets 
crushing of the hungarian uprising 12 years earlier east germanys 
defense minister said friday 
after a threeday warsaw pact meeting outside east berlin the 
soviet commander of the groups military forces acknowledged 
dissent within the ranks of the once rocksolid alliance 
with last years prodemocracy revolutions in eastern europe 
the sevennation warsaw pact has been facing increasing pressures 
from within east german defense minister rainer eppelmann has even 
predicted the breakup of the pacts military structures by the end 
of this year 
the defense ministers for the first time clearly discussed the 
past errors of the warsaw pact eppelmann told a news conference 
following the meeting in the suburb of strausberg 
eppelmann specifically mentioned as examples the warsaw pact 
invasion to put down the prague spring revolution by reform 
communists in 1968 and the soviets repression of an 
anticommunist revolt in hungary in 1956 
the situation has changed so much that relics from the 
division of the continent must be overcome eppelmann told 
reporters he did not say in what form the pact admitted the errors 
however defense minister miroslav vacek of czechoslovakia said 
earlier his colleagues apologized to a certain extent for the 
military intervention 22 years ago 
speaking about this weeks meeting the soviet commander of 
warsaw pact forces said there were differences of opinion 
regarding the prospects of the warsaw pact 
gen pg lushev also acknowledged differences on the 
development of the function and character of the pact but he 
appealed to moscows allies to continue fulfilling their 
obligations 
hungary and czechoslovakia have already received promises of 
large pullouts of soviet troops from their nations 
as long as there is a western alliance there will be a warsaw 
pact lushev said the military alliance was founded in 1955 it 
has been a counterbalance to the north atlantic treaty 
organization the western alliance during the cold war 
the coming unification of the two germanys was one of the 
dominant questions at the defense ministers meeting 
eppelmann the east german defense chief said he was suggesting 
sept 1 1992 as the date for full unification that date is far 
later than the general timeframe envisioned by west german 
officials

presidentelect ion iliescu on friday 
ordered home thousands of clubwielding coal miners after thanking 
them with all my heart for helping hunt down antigovernment 
demonstrators 
iliescus inauguration scheduled for friday was postponed 
following three days of rioting arson and mayhem in this capital 
of 22 million residents 
random attacks by the miners terrorized bucharest in the 
countrys worst violence since the december revolution that toppled 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu many miners were seen leaving 
friday 
state radio said at 10 pm the situation in bucharest is 
beginning to normalize 
at a news conference premier petre roman acknowledged the 
government held little sway over the mob of miners who 
indiscriminately attacked passersby in the capital beat 
journalists and ransacked opposition party headquarters 
in washington a bush administration official said 
nonhumaritarian aid to romania will be withheld to protest the 
violence 
state department spokesman richard boucher said aid programs 
being considered would be held up until the democratic process 
has been restored he said 80 million in food aid and 1 million 
in medical aid would not be affected 
miners trashed the home of ion ratiu chief of the opposition 
national peasant party who called the violence a death of 
democracy 
its the rule of the mob no respect for human rights the 
forces of law and order stand by instead of maintaining law and 
order he said 
ratiu said he was briefly detained thursday night and his 
colleagues were beaten by miners 
police and army units normally charged with law enforcement had 
watched without intervening as miners loyal to iliescu assaulted 
scores of people 
roman said the pit workers had been asked only to peacefully 
occupy university square and that the government deplored all 
subsequent violence 
wednesdays police crackdown on a 53day protest in the central 
square set off riots in which demonstrators threw firebombs at 
police headquarters and the interior ministry and overturned 
vehicles soldiers fired on the rioters 
the miners whose benefits greatly increased following the 
revolution streamed into the capital early thursday after iliescu 
pleaded for help to put down what he called a fascist revolt

state news agency rompres said 367 people were injured with 112 
still hospitalized 
the demonstrators say the government led by iliescu and his 
national salvation front and elected overwhelmingly in free 
elections on may 20 is dominated by former communists who they 
say continue ceausescus repressive policies 
the demonstrators want former communist leaders including 
iliescu banned from holding public office for 10 years 
on friday iliescu told cheering miners at the national 
exhibition hall in northern bucharest you are a strong force 
with much civic discipline people you can trust in good times and 
bad state television broadcast part of the meeting in which he 
thanked them with all my heart

northern railroad station they were to return on special trains to 
their homes in the jiu valley mining region of western romania

leave the capital tens of thousands were reported to have come to

western leaders on friday threatened to block 
economic pacts with romania following a harsh crackdown on 
antigovernment demonstrators 
many leaders decried the crackdown as a return to repressive 
tactics used by ousted communists 
coal miners using clubs were recruited to help police put down 
prodemocracy protests in the romanian capital of bucharest at 
least five people were killed and 367 injured in the worst violence 
since the december revolution that toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
the demonstrators claimed the freely elected government led by 
presidentelect ion iliescu is dominated by former communists 
i am not saying they should not restore a decent degree of 
order said british foreign office minister william waldegrave 
what i am saying is that the way they are responding the 
rhetoric they are using and the calling out of the old 
rentamob just as ceausescu used to do are signs that fill us 
with despondency 
the european community which hailed the fall of ceausescu will 
hold up a trade and economic cooperation accord finalized this 
week said bruce millan a member of the communitys executive 
commission in brussels 
i can give an absolute assurance that we will not proceed with 
that ratification procedure in the kind of circumstances that face 
us in romania at the moment millan said in strasbourg france 
in an address to the ec parliament 
other ec officials said there has been no final decision on 
suspending the accord the 12nation group will consider the pact 
monday 
millan also hinted that romania may lose aid from a more than 2 
billion fund created to assist former communist countries 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
nonhumanitarian aid programs to romania would be help up until 
the democratic process has been restored he said 80 million in 
food aid and 1 million in medical aid would not be affected 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
romania was trying to change from an authoritarian regime to a 
state of the rule of law 
there is no smooth road to that he said 
the hungarian foreign ministry on friday issued a communique 
expressing anxiety over events in neighboring romania 
resort to violence the use of brutal methods so familiar from 
before arrogance and organized aggression against political 
opposition is irreconcilable with european norms the communique 
said 
france which claimed four embassy staff members in bucharest 
were attacked during the crackdown lodged a strong protest with 
the romanian charge daffaires sabin pop in paris 
the governing socialist party in france accused iliescu of 
methods of repression which evoke the worst practices of 
stalinism 
the british foreign office summoned romanias senior envoy in 
london nicu bujor and warned that britain will find it difficult 
to give aid 
british officials also protested about the storming of the home 
of opposition leader ion ratiu head of the romanian national 
peasant party who is in exile in britain

japan in a statement by the foreign ministry accused the 
romanian authorities of an escessive use of power

singer miriam makeba said 
friday she has seen many changes in her home country after being 
exiled for 31 years but apartheid is still alive 
i can come home but i cannot vote she told a news 
conference after a oneweek visit to see her family and pray at her 
mothers grave 
the 58yearold singer mentioned that laws are still intact 
restricting black ownership of land and segregating education and 
residential areas 
my impressions are that there are some cosmetic changes i see 
we are all sitting here together without police coming to say 
what are you doing that is something she said 
she indicated some disagreement with the african national 
congress and other people about whether she would be breaking the 
organizations boycott on entertainers performing in south africa 
if she sang in public at home 
ms makeba said i believe as a south african the cultural 
boycott does not apply to me it depends on the comrades of the 
anc cultural desk there is some kind of confusion 
she said she does not know if she will live in south africa 
permanently but she wants to return and perform and bring her 
children and grandchildren 
it would be a shame for me to die tomorrow before i come back 
to sing before you because that is something i look forward to the 
most to come back and sing before the south african people where 
i do not have to translate my songs she said 
ms makeba has long supported the anc her songs were banned in 
south africa in 1962 when she spoke in favor of the organization at 
the united nations 
ms makeba sang one song extemporaneously and without 
accompaniment when called to the stage at a johannesburg nightclub 
this week 
she said visiting her mothers grave was her only program she 
left south africa in 1959 at the age of 27 to make a movie musical 
and appear on television in the united states but received a 
oneyear contract to sing at the village vanguard in new york 
when her mother died in 1960 the year the african national 
congress was outlawed ms makeba was denied permission to return 
home and attend the funeral 
after landing in johannesburg on a flight from her home in 
brussels belgium last sunday ms makeba went immediately to her 
mothers grave in soweto 
i tried to make a prayer i just choked and all i did was 
weep she said 
i sat on my mothers grave and i cried like a baby and i 
was happy because we believe that wherever they are a mother sees 
what we do they listen to what we say and i just consoled myself 
that wherever her soul is she now knows that her baby is here and 
she came to say mama i am back

a jury awarded nearly 76 million friday to the 
widow of a young actor stabbed to death by prison writer and norman 
mailer protege jack henry abbott 
abbott who wrote the bestseller in the belly of the beast 
acted as his own attorney in the wrongful death civil trial 
the suit was filed by ricci adan 32 abbott is serving a 
15yeartolife prison term for killing her husband richard adan 
22 outside a manhattan restaurant where he worked in 1981 
abbott 46 killed the actorwaiter with a single stab wound to 
the heart in his sometimes sneering testimony abbott claimed that 
adan didnt suffer because his death was sudden the jury found 
otherwise 
it awarded mrs adan 5575 million in compensatory damages for 
lost income and 2 million for her husbands pain and suffering 
before his death 
about 100000 abbott earned from his book remains frozen in an 
escrow account set up in case he lost the suit another 15000 
also earned from his writings is being held by the state crime 
victims board 
outside the courtroom mrs adan and her family whooped shouted 
and hugged each other to celebrate 
abbott asked presiding justice carol arber this is a little 
excessive your honor wouldnt you say 
the judge told abbott he could appeal but he did not say 
whether he would 
in the belly of the beast was composed of prison letters 
abbott sent to mailer from 1978 through 1981 
during those years abbott was imprisoned first for bank robbery 
and then for fatally stabbing another inmate mailer supported 
abbotts parole largely because of his writing talent abbot 
killed adan six weeks after leaving prison 
mailer has been unavailable for comment on abbotts latest court 
drama 
mrs adan said the judgment ended years of pain 
its been a nightmare she said hes not just a speck of 
dust anymore hes not just a victim or a piece of paper hes a 
human being and he can rest now 
abbott disputed an expert who said the fledgling actor could 
have earned 17 million by age 65 
abbott said those calculations assumed adan would have been a 
movie star of the caliber of paul newman 
kenneth fishman one of mrs adans attorneys was unimpressed 
by abbotts legal talents saying he would have flunked him in a 
law school class 
he had a certain feel for the courtroom having spent so much 
time in so many of them fishman said but he always had his 
ego in the way 
fishman noted that abbott asked every witness every juror the 
judge and virtually every other person he spoke to whether they had 
read his book 
naomi zack the state university of new york philosophy 
instructor abbott married last september while in prison was not 
in court for the verdict she had been present almost every day 
during the twoweek trial and was the only witness abbott called

the solidarityled government friday 
sent police with clubs and tear gas to open a highway blocked by 
farmers angry about a drop in milk prices 
the farmers left in the face of the show of force agreeing to 
suspend their protest at least until discussions with solidarity 
chairman lech walesa he was expected to arrive saturday 
protesters moved aside tractors blocking the twolane highway at 
wisniewo a rural community 80 miles northwest of warsaw the 
highway is the main road between warsaw and the northern port of 
gdansk 
the blockade of highway e7 began late tuesday after farmers 
learned the local dairy cooperative was reducing the price it would 
pay for milk to 2 cents a quart 
walesa was caught in their blockade thursday when he was being 
driven from his home in gdansk to warsaw for a flight to a meeting 
of the international labor organization in switzerland 
the labor leader told the farmers their dispute was local but 
he said it was justified he pledged to come back to help them 
resolve it if necessary 
the government stuck to its vow not to make special concessions 
that would deviate from the economic reform program designed to 
transform the socialist economy into a marketdriven system 
it refused to bargain with railway workers during their strike 
in may but walesa negotiated a return to work that was followed by 
a pay increase 
because the road blocked by the farmers is considered an 
international highway the government announced friday that it was 
obliged under agreements with other countries to keep it open it 
told the farmers that it would resort to force if necessary 
traffic was being diverted to other highways and several columns 
of police vehicles carrying officers armed with truncheons and 
tear gas arrived in wisniewo at dusk some officers were in 
armored vehicles and some came with water cannons 
it will be a second romania some townspeople called out 
when three helicopters suddenly appeared over their village it was 
a reference to the bloody romanian revolution in december 
hundreds of local residents sympathetic to the farmers milled 
around the streets late friday 
however the police vehicles parked along the side of the road 
and there was no confrontation 
andrzej wojtkowski a local resident said farmers had been 
complaining for months but only got the attention of authorities 
when they blocked the road 
its not a local problem it is a problem for the 
government he said 
he said the local dairy would not be in such trouble if not for 
the high interest rates imposed by the government in january to 
combat inflation 
according to wojtkowski the dairy has reduced the price it will 
pay for milk by more than half since april and farmers have no 
other potential buyer in the area 
farmers on friday donated their milk free to hospitals and 
apartment buildings but refused to sell it to the dairy

trillions of hungry microbes ate their 
way through an oil slick friday as officials counted on an 
experimental method to help with the cleanup from the wrecked 
norwegian tanker mega borg 
this is breakthrough technology texas land commissioner 
garry mauro said of the process called bioremediation 
rolling in open seas aboard a 41foot coast guard boat 
officials sprayed a square acre in the gulf of mexico that was 
intermittently laced and blanketed by oil 
bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria that have been 
bred as supereaters to break down oil into harmless fatty acids 
that later are eaten by marine life said carl oppenheimer who 
developed the process 
oppenheimer a university of texas microbiologist who has been 
working on the process for 15 years predicted success within one 
or two days there will be a clear square acre in the middle of the 
slick he said 
i think it is going to open the door now to bioremediation on 
a much wider scale he said 
skeptics have criticized oppenheimers work mauro said because 
the concept is so simple 
oppenheimer would only say of the experiment its been a long 
time coming 
he said some tests have been performed on controlled spills in 
inner harbor areas but never on the open sea 
bioremediation was applied last month for the exxon valdez spill 
in alaska microbes were used to clean some rocks on the shore of 
the prince william sound officials here allowed a test on the 
slick from the norwegian supertanker that exploded june 8 
we need bioremediation said texas water commission chairman 
bj buck wynne iii this is a man who had an idea and no one 
would listen he hasnt been able to get through all the snake oil 
salesmen 
oppenheimer said crews would return later to retrieve samples of 
the water that was treated with the microbes he said there would 
approximately 53 billion microbes per square centimeter 
about 100 pounds of the sandlike substance was mixed with sea 
water and sprayed onto the slick 
oppenheimer said the slick about three miles southeast of the 
mega borg probably was about oneeighth of an inch thick markers 
were set to track the movement of the area that was treated 
he said he believed the process could remove about 90 percent of 
the oil compared with the 5 or 10 percent he said skimmers could 
remove oppenheimer described skimmers as mostly cosmetic

an 11state sweep targeting street gangs that 
export drug dealing from california ghettos to other states netted 
more than 170 arrests authorities said friday 
the action dubbed operation street sweep began thursday with 
hundreds of federal agents and local law officers moving in on 
members of the crips and bloods violent gangs spawned in poor 
southern california neighborhoods 
by late afternoon friday 174 arrests had been made officials 
said 
what began as a los angeles problem has now spread to a 
national one said stephen e higgins director of the federal 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
arrests were made in california louisiana arizona new mexico 
texas missouri oklahoma oregon washington and two other states 
that werent identified because warrants were still being served 
authorities at a news conference to announce the sweep displayed 
a sample of confiscated weapons but did not detail the quantity of 
weapons or drugs seized 
a national investigation by the bureau revealed the rival crips 
and bloods were heavily involved in crack cocaine distribution and 
firearms trafficking nationwide higgins said 
gang members are involved in murders driveby shootings 
narcotics trafficking assaults credit car fraud robberies and 
money laundering he said adding the operation was intended to 
send a message to violent street gangs 
more arrests were expected through the weekend atf spokesman 
jack killorian said from washington dc 
this was not a search and investigative operation it was an 
arrest operation killorian said most of the arrests were 
fugitives and the majority were charged with federal weapons 
charges 
the sweep focused on southern california where 134 arrests were 
made in los angeles orange riverside san bernardino and san 
diego counties 
arrests in louisiana were related to a january seizure in 
shreveport of nearly 13 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated 
250000 killorian said 
higgins was unable to say if those arrested were gang leaders 
they arent formally structured in that sense but these are 
people who control a fair amount of the drug market he said 
although outnumbered by drug traffickers law enforcement 
officers efforts to eradicate drug dealing could prevail he said 
im convinced its a winnable war higgins said were in 
it for the long term

pope john paul ii on friday greeted south 
african antiapartheid leader nelson mandela and blessed his 
efforts to destroy the system of racial segregation 
but the pontiff did not directly answer mandelas request to 
support economic sanctions to keep pressure on south africas white 
leaders 
papal spokesman joaquin navarro said the vatican considers 
sanctions a political issue but that apartheid was an ethical 
problem that is proper for the pope to address 
john paul received mandela in a 25minute audience part of the 
african national congress deputy presidents sixweek tour of 
europe africa and north america 
as reporters were let into the popes private library at the end 
of the talks john paul told mandela freed feb 11 after more than 
27 years in prison thanks be to god that we can meet 
the pope in the past has praised mandela as a man who suffers 
for the rights of his people and the vatican last year issued a 
major document on racism harshly condemning apartheid 
turning to reporters mandela explained that the anc believes 
sanctions need to be maintained and i asked them the holy see 
to express themselves very clearly on this issue 
i asked our father the pope to bless this initiative because 
we are sure his blessing would help because his stands on issues 
like apartheid and antisemitism have been so clear they have won 
respect from the whole world 
john paul then said in english god bless your initiatives 
in a later news conference mandela said the pope indicated 
vatican officials were putting moral pressure to induce the south 
african government to abandon apartheid 
he added that john paul had not asked the anc to give up armed 
struggle 
if an oppressor uses force and brutality in addressing the 
legitimate aspirations of the people the people are entitled in a 
defensive manner to adopt or resort to violence too he said he 
added that the pontiff apparently understands the position better 
than some of you journalists do 
in a statement issued after the meeting the vatican said the 
audience granted to mandela was further confirmation of the holy 
sees commitment in favor of a peaceful political evolution in 
south africa and the progressive overcoming of the system of 
apartheid 
under apartheid south africas 28 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy 
mandela said he was very encouraged by his talks friday 
afternoon with premier giulio andreotti a christian democrat 
mandela asked italy for financial and material support for the anc 
as it reorganizes a spokesman for the premier said 
at the news conference mandela made one of his harshest attacks 
on black leaders lucas mangope the head of the nominally 
independent homeland of bophuthatswana and mangosuthu buthelezi 
the head of inkatha a zulubased conservative political 
organization that opposes sanctions 
asked why they had not been included in negotiations between the 
government and the anc mandela said mangope had been kept in power 
by white authorities i dont think that he is any factor at all 
in what is going on in south africa today mandela said 
he said buthelezi agreed to work with the government on 
projects which we do not believe are in the interests of the black 
people 
later friday mandela flew to the netherlands for a twoday 
visit that was seen as recognition of that nations opposition to 
apartheid he and his wife winnie arrived on an italian air force 
jet at a dutch navy air base outside the hague 
his visit will include a breakfast meeting saturday with dutch 
leaders including premier ruud lubbers mandela is also expected 
to meet queen beatrix at her palace an unusual honor for 
nongovernmental visitors

the justice department on thursday sided with 
the major television networks in their fight to regain the right to 
own or be able to sell their programs in the lucrative rerun market 
the department said it supported a 1983 conclusion by the 
federal communications commission that allowing tv networks to have 
a financial interest and syndication rights in the programs they 
broadcast would not hurt competition 
it appears that in purchasing television entertainment 
programs the networks compete not only with each other but also 
increasingly with other purchasers of television entertainment 
programs the department said in a filing with the commission 
it urged the commission to eliminate the financial interest 
and syndication rules unless the record demonstrates that they are 
necessary to protect the public interest in competition 
the fcc in march said it would reconsider 1970 rules that 
prohibit abc cbs and nbc from having an interest in their programs 
or selling them in syndication 
the fcc had postponed beginning its inquiry until thursday to 
give the interested parties one last chance to work out an 
agreement to alter the rules known as finsyn producers and 
the networks have been engaged in oftenacrimonious talks to change 
the rules ever since 1983 
the talks failed this week again and the commission began 
accepting comments thursday 
fcc chairman alfred sikes who has said he wants some changes in 
the rules said he was disappointed but not surprised that the 
parties did not reach agreement 
the fcc earlier this year granted fox broadcasting co a waiver 
from the finsyn rules so it could continue to grow into a true 
network fox also is a syndicator and it is owned by a major 
hollywood producer twentieth century fox film corp 
fox inc chairman barry diller on thursday in a statement in 
los angeles said there was an urgent need to review the rules 
and to revise the definition of a network he said the fcc should 
be encouraging companies such as fox 
in 1983 the fcc tentatively decided to eliminate the financial 
interest rule and narrow the syndication rule to prohibit only 
network participation in domestic syndication of prime time 
programs but it delayed the proceeding under pressure from 
congress and president reagan and urged the interested parties to 
find a solution themselves 
in march the fcc officially terminated that inquiry and began 
the new one 
networks argue that the finsyn rules give undue market power to 
producers and impede the networks abilities to compete in the 
increasingly multinational program marketplace 
advocates of the rules claim they have helped small producers 
flourish and have led to more diversity in programming 
the justice department told the fcc that if the networks do 
not have significant market power it appears that the practices 
prohibited by the rules would not in these circumstances create 
such power 
it also appears unlikely that the rules significantly 
constrain the exercise of any market power that the networks may 
possess but we cannot conclusively rule out that possibility 
the department conceded it was possible that removing the rules 
could result in wealth transfers from producers to networks 
but this would not warrant retaining the rules unless such 
transfers would be accompanied by an adverse effect on program 
output and thus a decrease in social welfare the department said 
it said increased competition in the program production market 
and efficiencies gained through network ownership of financial 
interests and syndication rights would benefit the public

crews on friday began spraying 
oileating microbes on the slick surrounding the burning 
supertanker mega borg in the first opensea release of the bacteria 
to clean up a spill 
the coast guard boosted its estimate of the amount of oil 
released into the gulf of mexico to 43 million gallons making it 
the nations fifth largest spill 
the fire was extinguished friday afternoon but officials said 
they would have to wait at least 24 hours for the ship to cool 
before removing the remaining oil the ship could catch fire again 
coast guard ptty officer todd nelson said 
there are no flames however its still real hot and if we 
walk away from it right now it may reflash nelson said 
the coast guard had said the first tar balls from the leaking 
norwegian supertanker could wash ashore late friday on bolivar 
peninsula across the bay from galveston island but county 
officials said they had no unusual reports of oil on shore 
we dont anticipate the oil will come before sunday were 
prepared said galveston city manager doug matthews 
crews on four fireboats also continued spraying water on the 
886foot ship which exploded and caught fire late last friday 57 
miles off galveston gray smoke spewed from the rear section of the 
vessel 
more than two dozen smaller boats used skimming devices to suck 
up or corral the rusty brown oil trailing from the tanker salvage 
crews said they had skimmed 146389 gallons of oil 
the coast guard said most of the light african crude evaporated 
or burned and less than 22000 gallons remained in the water 
the coast guard would not elaborate on how it reached the 43 
million gallon estimate for the spill the spill earlier had been 
estimated at 3 million gallons 
the worst oil spill in us history was last year when the exxon 
valdez ran aground spilling nearly 11 million gallons of heavy 
crude on the prince william sound in alaska 
in the experimental use of the microbes officials working on a 
coast guard boat mixed the bacteria with sea water and sprayed it 
on a section of the 30milelong slick 
about 100 pounds of microbes were sprayed over an acre in a 
procedure that lasted about 30 minutes friday afternoon officials 
will check the area saturday to see if the experiment was 
successful 
the process known as bioremediation has never been tried on an 
oil spill in open seas although lab experiments have been 
successful said texas land commissioner garry mauro 
bioremediation has been used for years to clean up hazardous 
waste sites treat sewage and wastewater extract oil from tight 
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the exxon 
valdez accident mauro said 
at valdez cleanup sites workers have been applying nitrogen and 
phosphorous fertilizer that promotes growth in the sand of the 
naturally occurring bacteria 
the bacteria eats the oil and reduces it to a fatty substance 
that fish can eat when the oil runs out the microbes die 
on shore galveston officials kept an eye on the advancing slick 
we have not had any indication of any oil coming ashore pat 
hallisey executive director of the galveston county beach park 
board said friday were keeping our fingers crossed 
coast guard petty officer gene maestas said there were some 
streams of oil but the captain of the port ordered skimmers to 
collect them 
the largest sheen of oil extended from the vessel about 10 miles 
to the northwest with two additional patches beginning 10 miles 
farther the slick nearest to land was about 25 miles away 
firefighters on the mega borg pumped oil from a leaking cargo 
tank into another tank to try and cut off the fuel source from the 
fire previously firefighting efforts have consisted mostly of 
showering water on the vessel 
this could improve the situation coast guard capt tom 
greene said were planning to work on this in conjunction with 
putting out the fire 
crews also pumped water from a tank on the left side of the boat 
to help stabilize the ship its rear section has been awash and 
listing slightly to the left 
in galveston a norwegian maritime panel ended three days of 
questioning surviving crew members in hopes of finding what caused 
the explosion and blast they asked third mate jaipal singh 
mahlawat to elaborate on a fuel leak discovered in the ships pump 
room six hours before the explosion 
i saw the pump man he was screwing a coupling back to stop 
the oil from leaking mahlawat said no oil was leaking he had 
already wiped it out 
the pump man putham mahamood testified thursday through a 
translator that he performed no measurable repair work the day 
of the explosion 
the mega borgs chief engineer told the panel thursday one of 
the vessels pumps was leaking fuel about six hours before the 
explosion and a norwegian shipping inspector said some other pumps 
were overdue for an inspection 
the hearing panel will send its factfinding report to the 
norwegian maritime investigative bureau which will determine if 
the ship is seaworthy and if there is any criminal liability 
of the 41 people aboard the ship two crewmen were killed two 
are missing and presumed dead and 17 were injured none seriously

roger carstairs is a movie star who once was big 
box office then they had to team him with a female star to sell 
tickets in his most recent picture he was forced to share billing 
with a horse and now hes making a movie with a creature from 
outer space guess who gets more attention 
desperation time in hollywood is the theme of price of fame 
charles grodins desperate little comedy that arrived wednesday at 
offbroadways roundabout theater 
grodin also stars as the fading actor but its a mistake hes 
too laidback in the role grodin is not neurotic enough playing 
the star who compulsively checks the grosses of his latest bomb of 
a movie or tries to fend off an inquisitive female magazine 
interviewer 
its this magazine reporter a shrill performance by lizbeth 
mackay who sets the plot in motion she has been assigned by her 
editor who is also her boyfriend to do a hatchet piece on roger 
what she doesnt know is the editors previous girlfriend was once 
stolen away by roger 
things get complicated and a tad improbable when roger maneuvers 
the reporter into bed before the interview is over naturally the 
boyfriend shows up in act 2 before a confusing and bittersweet 
final curtain 
grodin the playwright softens the ending by having the actor 
reconcile with his son a slightly dopey lad who works on the movie 
as a gofer but even that is unexpected since there was no hint of 
a problem between the two for most of the two acts 
grodin never lets us see why this movie actor was special hes 
more like an accountant than a big star consequently whatever 
happens to him elicits little interest 
and his jokes about hollywood are pretty tame especially from 
someone with firsthand knowledge about how the movie business game 
is played 
the slowmoving direction by gloria muzio doesnt help the rest 
of the actors including jace alexander as the son and joseph r 
sicari as a talkative makeup man labor mightily to liven things 
up but the overall effect is much energy expended for little 
result 
one interesting footnote to the production appearing in a small 
role is jeanne berlin grodins costar in the wonderful film 
the heartbreak kid the actress is wasted here the most 
glaring example of another promise left unfulfilled by this 
insiders tale of tinseltown

the opposition social democrats gave 
halfhearted approval thursday to economic merger with east 
germany saying they wont fight it but that chancellor helmut kohl 
is to blame for any untoward consequences 
their action removes the last political obstacle to launching 
the economic and monetary union that takes effect july 2 merging 
the currencies and other economic mechanisms will mark a huge step 
toward formal german unification 
the leftofcenter social democrats made their decision at a 
special leadership meeting on thursday that included oskar 
lafontaine the partys nominee for chancellor in west german 
elections set for dec 2 
lafontaine has harshly criticized the treaty between the two 
germanys but his position deeply divided the social democrats and 
speculation arose that he might quit his candidacy because of 
internal feuding 
lafontaine remains popular however and has decided to stay in 
the race 
party leaders agreed thursday the party should not try to block 
the merger treaty but at the same time they washed their hands of 
any responsibility if the merger brings unwelcome results 
one leader norbert gansel said the party sees economic merger 
as unavoidable and necessary because of the high expectations 
it has produced in east germany but he said the party was not 
offering an uncritical yes 
reading from a leadership statement gansel said kohls 
government will bear sole responsibility if dramatic problems 
arise from the economic merger 
gansel even left the door open for individual party members to 
vote against the merger when the treaty comes up for parliamentary 
ratification on june 21 and 22 he said any lawmaker voting against 
would not be acting outside of solidarity with the rest of the 
party 
experts say up to 2 million east germans could lose their jobs 
as antiquated factories go bust that could produce unrest in east 
germany 
another concern is that west germans will face hefty tax 
increases to pay for rebuilding east germanys economy kohls 
government insists tax increases will not be needed 
for weeks the social democrats tried to get kohls government 
to change the treaty to provide more job protection for east 
germans 
but the party was reluctant to press its objections to the 
merger treaty too strongly lest it anger east germans eagerly 
awaiting the anticipated fruits of economic merger and overhaul of 
the battered east german economy 
the social democrats still want to be in a position to reap a 
political windfall however if kohls economic merger plans 
produce severely negative effects

gun and rocketpropelled grenade exchanges between christian troops 
loyal to rebel gen michel aoun and militiamen of samir geageas

interchristian fighting in lebanons 15year civil war which has 
more often pitted christians against moslems

a rising conservative politician was 
suspended by fellow party members for suggesting an alliance with 
the governing socialists in one district to battle a farright 
candidate 
the move could be the first step in expelling grenoble mayor 
alain carignon from the rally for the republic party and was seen 
by some as symbolizing disarray and weakness in the traditional 
right 
carignon 41 a former environmental minister angered party 
leaders by publicly endorsing an alliance with president francois 
mitterrands socialists to oppose a candidate from the farright 
national front party in a district election runoff sunday in 
villeurbaine a suburb of lyons 
national front leader jeanmarie le pen favors expelling moslem 
immigrants from france and has been accused of antisemitism about 
4 million of frances 55 million people are immigrants many 
africans from former french colonies 
although the republic party does not support the national 
fronts platform it is a bitter rival of the socialists republic 
party leaders have urged its supporters to abstain from voting in 
sundays elections 
on sunday national front candidate pierre vial received 273 
percent of the vote in valleurbaine to defeat conservative party 
candidates vial faces socialist candidate nathalie gauthier who 
had 368 percent of the vote 
the republic party finished third with 17 percent of the vote 
its a moral question carignon said urging voters to 
form a barrier to the extremist candidate 
carignon was suspended tuesday on grounds he violated party 
policy of abstaining from voting for other party candidates the 
suspension could lead to carignons expulsion if expelled he 
would retain his mayors post but without formal party backing 
we cannot continue to show our electors this spectacle of 
disorder said party secretary general alain juppe 
carignon served as environment minister when republic party 
leader jacques chirac was prime minister from 1986 to 1988 
the national front won 12 percent of the vote in national 
elections in 1988 it recently won its only seat in the 577seat

lets not waste words six degrees of 
separation by john guare is a crackling good play a snappy 
smart tale of manhattan made even more intriguing because it is 
based on a real incident 
the production which opened thursday at the mitzi newhouse 
theater in lincoln center is also wonderfully funny and inventive 
not only in its unexpected plot twists but in the way director 
jerry zaks brings out its darker more serious moments 
guare who used a newspaper story as the starting point for his 
play has created a scathing satiric look at the fads foibles and 
follies of living in manhattan circa 1990 the news article told 
of a hoax involving a young man who claimed to be the son of actor 
sidney poitier and how he duped several prominent new york families 
in guares play just about everyone is a con man even its 
uppercrust liberal hero and heroine flan and ouisa are not 
above pulling a scam of sorts hes an art dealer who courts 
wealthy foreigners you know says the wife the kind of people who 
cant scrape together enough money for dinner but can come up with 
2 million for a secondrate cezanne 
but these east siders meet their match in paul a young man who 
shows up at their apartment the lad claiming to a friend of their 
collegeage children has just been mugged the couple embrace him 
especially after he says he is poitiers son 
the youth cooks dinner for them and is invited to stay he 
promises to introduce them to his father and even get them jobs in 
a movie version of cats that his father allegedly is directing 
he also dazzles them with conversation about his college thesis on 
the catcher in the rye only later do the entranced couple 
learn he is a fraud 
his cover is blown when flans lawyer and his wife tell a 
similar story it seems they were duped by paul the previous week 
and guare adds a third victim a physician who allows paul to stay 
over in his brownstone 
the unraveling of pauls real identity wont be revealed here 
but the detective work involves the children of these wealthy 
people the kids are portrayed as adolescent gargoyles blaming 
their parents for everything that has gone wrong in their lives and 
determined to make them suffer 
guare has captured their revenge hilariously particularly in a 
diatribe for actor evan handler who plays a spiteful son railing 
against his father 
the play then turns serious when pauls flimflam takes in a 
naive couple from utah babes in the big city the consequences of 
his deceptions are tragic guare weaves all the stories together 
the one link being the young man who has been able to affect for 
good and ill so many lives 
the entire cast is firstrate but special mention should be 
made of the three leads stockard channing makes the baffled 
bewildered matron a figure of sympathy by the end of the play john 
cunningham is the epitome of wasp pomposity as her husband james 
mcdaniel is astonishing as paul portraying him as victimizer and 
victim too 
tony waltons stylized set is mostly a series of picture frames 
and a couch or two strewn on the playing area but they work 
brilliantly to suggest a variety of locales including a bench in 
central park 
the odd title six degrees of separation refers to a 
concept articulated by ouisa as she ponders how she and her friends 
were brought in contact with paul everybody on the planet is 
separated from everybody else by only six people she says adding 
that the trick is to find the right six people guare has not only 
found the right people but put them on stage with dazzling results

a cuban art museum targeted by exile hardliners 
for showing works by artists considered sympathetic to communist 
cuba was ripped by a terrorist bomb thursday for the second time in 
two years 
a highorder explosive blew out the front of the cuban 
museum of arts and culture in little havana at 109 am said fbi 
spokesman paul miller 
this is a terrorist incident he said 
the museum was closed at the time and there were no injuries 
no arrests have been made and miller would not comment on whether 
the fbis antiterrorism task force in miami had any suspects 
it was the 17th cubanrelated bombing or attempted bombing laid 
to terrorists in the area in three years 
the blast damaged artwork inside scattered debris along the 
street outside broke windows in nearby buildings and left a small 
crater in the sidewalk 
it did a considerable amount of damage to the front of the 
building including structural damage to the roof miller said 
damage to the art pieces by 16 cuban artists who arrived on the 
mariel boatlift in 1980 was estimated at 10000 miller said 
preliminary estimates of damage to the building ranged into the 
tens of thousands 
there is nothing very controversial that were exhibiting 
now said museum director osvaldo monzon he said the display 
is something that im quite proud of the art of artists who 
came from mariel and have succeeded greatly 
in may 1988 a small pipe bomb blew out the front door while art 
from cuba was on display thursdays explosion wasnt caused by a 
pipe bomb fbi experts will analyze evidence from the scene to 
determine what it was miller said 
the fbi and miami police department believe this is the 17th 
device since may 1987 of a terrorist nature attributed to 
individuals who have targeted individuals businesses and museums 
they believe may advocate better relations with castros cuba he 
said 
most of the bombs have been small devices placed outside 
buildings and homes at night before thursday the most recent 
bombing was at an optical store in suburban hialeah last september 
the bombing in may 1988 occurred during a controversy in the 
citys cuban community over the handling of works by artists 
considered sympathetic to cuban president fidel castro 
the day after the bombing 17 of the museums directors and five 
top officials resigned saying the institution had lost touch with 
the community and the trauma suffered by cubans on their island 
homeland 
monzon vowed thursday that the museum would not be intimidated 
we will continue he said political pressure and 
terrorists will not discourage us

direction are pulled over and detained briefly are not as 
efficient as other methods used by police to catch drunken drivers 
or keep them off the road 
we must begin to assure that every community will make 
checkpoints a key element of an allout campaign to finally rid our 
roads of the menace posed by drinking drivers said micky sadoff

gen george s pattons 2nd armored 
division helped win the battle of the bulge but now it has lost 
the battle of the budget 
the army has decided to deactivate the unit ending its colorful 
history as the armored division with the longest active service 
record formed in july 1940 for european service in world war ii 
the division is being dismantled 50 years later in anticipation of 
european peace 
this division has the most glorious history of any combat unit 
in the us army lt charles macmaster at fort hood said 
thursday 
patton dubbed the division hell on wheels promising it 
would terrify enemies its troops adopted the nickname as their 
motto today its soldiers still proudly wear hell on wheels on 
their division patch

for 40 years the army grumbled about pvt 
beetle bailey hes a real misfit they said lazy no spit and 
polish drives the sarge nuts hell never make corporal let him 
peel potatoes forever 
then one fine day somebody in the pentagon with silver stars on 
his shoulders looked around the table and told the men with silver 
eagles on their shirt collars hey you know the little guys 
funny 
yes sir they all replied nodding in unison 
and so it was that an incredulous mort walker a cartoonist who 
once slogged through the mud at fort leonard wood mo as an army 
draftee in world war ii was ushered into the pentagon on thursday 
and given a heros welcome

two years ago carl marriotts farm fields were dusty his 
soybeans were shriveled his prospects bleak this spring he has a 
different brown sickly crop but theres a different culprit rain 
yes rain the manna from heaven midwest farmers hoped and 
prayed for these past few years has flooded fields delayed 
planting and damaged crops but survivors of one or even two 
consecutive droughts arent complaining 
we just roll with the punches weve got options we can pull 
out of the bag when its wet said marriott a southern illinois 
farmer who may lose a quarter of his waterlogged wheat crop when 
its dry theres nothing we can do 
weve been biting our tongues said mark white a chariton 
iowa farmer whose fields were parched in 1988 and 89 then too 
muddy to work all last month ill take a wet year over a dry 
year anytime at least youve got a chance to grow something 
after the most devastating decade in half a century marred by 
drought high interest rates and plummeting land values many 
farmers have entered the 1990s with one of the wettest springs in 
recent times and the brightest outlook in 10 years 
the farmer is in the best shape hes been since 1980 said 
gregory hanson an economist at the us agriculture department 
weve got rising land values rising sales rising investment 
im not trying to paint a pollyanna picture on the other hand 
theres the famous rubber ball theory of economics what bounced 
down is now bouncing up 
though an unseasonably cool wet spring may prevent a bumper 
crop the economic forecast is promising cash income for the farm 
sector which includes government subsidies has been projected at 
55 billion to 59 billion for 1990 a record if it reaches the 
outer limit and better than last years estimated 54 billion 
hog and cattle prices are at or near record levels corn prices 
are up because the surplus is down farm exports have increased 
land values are expected to rise about 4 percent in 1990 about 
the same level they did in 1989 and machinery sales have jumped 
by 50 percent in the last four years 
when i look at the farm economy i look at a growth sector 
hanson said ten years ago it was a sector ready to take a 
fall 
the national farm debt which peaked in 1983 at 206 billion 
could dip to as low as 145 billion in 1990 he said 
farmers who survived the 80s are smarter and more careful about 
their purchases said neil harl an economics professor at iowa 
state university 
some have been burned some were singed some were just close 
to the heat he said at the same time he added lenders are 
more cautious and conservative 
as the new decade begins some signs of a turnaround are due to 
the weather some to a reversal in economic fortunes for example 
in kansas a record winter wheat crop is forecast for 1990 
4602 million bushels more than double last years 
droughtbattered 2136 million bushels 
theyre laughing jim shroyer extension agronomist at 
kansas state university said of the farmers theyre really 
looking forward to harvest this really lifts their spirits 
nationally winter wheat production is expected to reach a 
nineyear high of 2 billion bushels despite some losses from wet 
weather 
in iowa land values jumped nearly 45 percent from 1986 to 
1989 though theyre still far below 1981 peak levels less than 
one in five farmers had significant money troubles last year 
compared with a third in 1986 harl said 
in minnesota state officials say soil moisture is the best it 
has been since november 1986 
despite such optimistic signs drought persists in areas 
including florida and parts of colorado in california in its 
fourth straight dry year reservoirs are low enough that the state 
and us bureau of reclamation cut in half the amount of this 
years irrigation water to farmers 
and in the upper midwest even though puddles in the fields make 
people smile a recent wet spell in north dakota was dubbed the 
milliondollar rain they havent convinced anyone the drought 
is over 
by no means are we out of the woods said tim edman special 
assistant to south dakota gov george mickelson if we go back to 
the 90degreeplus windy dry weather conditions we could be 
facing a problem very quickly just as serious as the last two 
years 
in 1988 all of south dakota was declared a drought disaster 
area last year it was twothirds of the state 
while many cursed the drought others now say rainy cool 
weather is no blessing 
in michigan for example some apple growers say its reduced 
their crop in missouri a fourth of the corn is in poor or very 
poor shape and planting is five weeks behind schedule and in 
illinois pastures with water bellyhigh to the livestock and 
fields too muddy to put a tractor in have farmers worried 
its rained so much our wheat is full of blight said herman 
krone who welcomed thenpresident reagan to his shriveled southern 
illinois farm fields in 1988 instead of ripening its dying in 
standing water its been 43 years since ive seen something 
like this 
but its too early to make dire predictions and dry sunny days 
last week allowed many farmers to get back into the fields some 
also say as time runs out to plant corn they may switch to 
soybeans which have a later growing season 
thats an option for marriott a fourthgeneration farmer who 
normally would have planted all his corn by now but had completed 
less than 5 percent by the second week of june a situation to 
which hes resigned 
farming is hills and valleys he said you have good crops 
some years and some years good prices seldom together 
its either feast or famine said bill million agriculture 
extension adviser in adams county in western illinois farmers 
are just taking it one day at a time 
not long ago million said they looked to the skies for 
salvation rain 
now theyre praying for it to stop just a bit he said 
typical human beings were never satisfied

a heros welcome awaits nelson 
mandela in the united states where the black nationalist leader 
will lobby for continued sanctions against south africa and 
millions of dollars in support for the antiapartheid movement 
since his release feb 11 after more than 27 years in prison 
mandela has been cheered at rallies across africa and europe 
a jubilant reception is expected in the united states for the 
deputy president of the african national congress movement who is 
especially revered among blacks who waged the civil rights battle 
of the 1960s 
president bush and congress will receive mandela in washington 
during his eightcity 10day visit which begins wednesday in new 
york and features parades rallies and a speech at the united 
nations 
the other cities on his itinerary are boston atlanta miami 
detroit los angeles and oakland calif 
mandelas chief mission is to lobby the us government to 
maintain the limited economic sanctions imposed in 1986 after 
protests over south african policies of apartheid or forced 
segregation 
american politicians movie stars businessmen and black 
organizations all are scrambling to share in the glow of his fame 
or at least have their pictures taken with him but mandela has 
remained modest and acknowledges debts to us supporters of the 
antiapartheid movement 
the blacks in the united states have been in the front lines 
of the struggle against apartheid he said recently the us 
government itself would not have taken the steps which they have 
adopted if there was no pressure from the masses of americans 
american public pressure has contributed to the withdrawal of 
more than half of the 300 us companies that were operating in 
south africa since the mid1980s many us universities and 
municipal governments have withdrawn investments in companies that 
remain 
the release of mandela who was imprisoned after being convicted 
of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white minority 
government came days after president fw de klerk lifted a 
30year ban on the anc 
now mandela is hoping to raise millions of dollars to help 
formally reestablish the anc presence inside south africa the 
efforts include his public appearances private fundraising dinners 
and even the sale of sneakers and tshirts sporting the anc colors 
some western governments have indicated a fresh willingness to 
reconsider sanctions against south africa in view of reforms 
instituted by de klerk who brought about mandelas release 
last month in brussels de klerk urged the 12nation european 
community to end its sanctions because of dynamic changes 
including the prospect of blackwhite talks on ending policies of 
racial segregation 
south africas white minority rule governs 5 million whites 28 
million blacks and about 3 million people of mixed race apartheid 
establishes a racially segregated society in which blacks have no 
vote in national affairs 
the de klerk administration has met some but not all of the 
conditions set by congress for lifting limited sanctions it imposed 
in 1986 overriding a veto by thenpresident reagan 
the united states is the only country which has incorporated a 
measure in its legislation making it an offense to trade some 
items with south africa mandela said i will applaud the 
united states for this 
but ties between the anc and the us government are relatively 
new 
the anc with offices in more than 30 countries worldwide only 
last year established a washington office 
in 1988 the defense department listed the anc as a 
terrorist organization the state department disagreed publicly 
with the description but has urged the anc to abandon its largely 
ineffective guerrilla campaign 
there have been other obstacles 
reagans opposition to sanctions and his constructive 
engagement policy which stressed the maintenance of working ties 
with the whiteled government drew harsh criticism from the anc 
throughout the 1980s at antiapartheid rallies blacks often 
denounced reagan in the same breath with former south african 
president pw botha 
about half the anc leadership though not mandela also are 
members of the south african communist party the ancs guerrilla 
campaign has been backed by the soviet union although military aid 
is declining 
in angola anc guerrillas have fought alongside marxist 
government troops battling the usbacked unita rebels 
since his release mandela has praised cubas fidel castro 
embraced palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat and 
visited libyan leader moammar gadhafi the man for whom one of 
mandelas grandsons is named 
yet mandela has proven skilled enough as a politician to win the 
endorsement of us jewish groups despite his support for arafat 
abraham foxman of the us antidefamation league of bnai 
brith said after meeting mandela in june that no jewish 
organization should have reservations about the mandela visit 
he added i will probably raise my voice and proclaim he is a 
friend 
mandela will spend time with two of his daughters studying in 
massachusetts zenani dhlamini a student at boston university is 
the daughter of mandela and his current wife winnie mandelas 
daughter by his first wife makaziwe mandelaamuah studies at 
amherst college 
skeptics say americans are fixated on mandela the legend rather 
than the man 
what people want is a saint a sort of moral celebrity 
wrote simon barber washington correspondent for the south african 
financial paper business day 
at home mandela faces critics ranging from rightwing whites 
who call him a terrorist to militant blacks who accuse the anc of 
selling out by pursuing negotiations with de klerks government 
any criticism in the united states is likely to be tame by 
comparison 
woe betide the policymaker politician scholar or journalist 
who evinces the slightest skepticism barber wrote this is 
particularly true in the us where the civil rights movement has 
adopted mandela as a sort of martin luther king reborn

nelson mandela is taking 
center stage during his lobbying mission for black nationalism in 
south africa but controversy still swirls around his wife 
winnie mandela will accompany her husband on his eightcity 
10day tour of the united states which starts wednesday in new 
york 
the woman who once shouted down police and was accused of 
beating men with whips has been standing demurely by his side 
during the couples tours of africa and europe 
a year ago some of south africas most prominent antiapartheid 
leaders denounced mrs mandela accusing her of violating human 
rights in the name of the struggle against apartheid 
the south african attorneygeneral is considering whether to 
prosecute mrs mandela in connection with a case of kidnapping and 
assault in which one of the victims later was found dead 
her former chief bodyguard jerry richardson has been convicted 
of kidnapping assault and murder in connection with the stabbing 
death of a 14yearold black activist james stompie moeketsi 
seipei 
he was abducted dec 29 1988 and his body recovered eight days 
later 
three black men testified at richardsons trial that they and 
the teenager were abducted taken to mrs mandelas home and 
beaten by mrs mandela who then let her bodyguards continue the 
assaults 
the judge ruled their testimony had the ring of truth 
the trial of mrs mandelas former driver and seven others who 
stayed at her house originally was scheduled for may 29 but has 
been postponed until september said klaus von lieres und wilkau 
attorneygeneral for the johannesburg region 
he said his office has reserved a decision on whether to 
prosecute mrs mandela or not at this stage we have not taken a 
decision 
mrs mandela has been the focus of controversy or at least 
attention many times before 
she was under police restrictions almost continuously from 1963 
to 1986 was arrested numerous times and held in solitary 
confinement for 17 months in 196970 
during nationwide unrest from 198487 she appeared at the 
funerals of slain activists and gave militant speeches urging 
blacks to harbor guerrilla fighters and take the armed struggle 
to white neighborhoods 
without explaining why the government lifted her restrictions 
on movement and speech in 1986 shortly after she told a rally 
with our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate 
this country 
it was an endorsement of the gruesome necklace killings in 
which militants set burning gasolinesoaked tires around the necks 
of black political opponents policemen and their families 
the african national congress in exile disavowed the statement 
by the wife of its effective leader 
some say mrs mandela was not equipped for the public position 
thrust upon her as the spokesman for her imprisoned husband and his 
outlawed movement 
she married mandela in 1958 when she was a 24yearold social 
worker and he was a 40yearold anc leader four years later he 
was arrested 
mandela once wrote from prison that he wondered whether any 
kind of commitment can ever be sufficient excuse for abandoning a 
young and inexperienced woman in a pitiless desert 
when her husband was freed and came home to soweto mrs 
mandela a 56yearold grandmother said she was glad to become a 
housewife a job she had never had a chance to do 
ive been giving orders and now i have to take them she 
said

here are some facts about 
nelson mandela 
name nelson rolihlahla mandela 
age 71 
born july 18 1918 in transkei the son of a xhosa tribal 
chief 
title deputy president of the african national congress 
arrested august 5 1962

the country illegally and inciting blacks to violate the law by 
striking sentenced in june 1964 to life imprisonment for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the government 
imprisoned 27 years 
released february 11 1990 
current political objective mandela says dialogue between the 
south african government and the anc is the only way to a peaceful 
future he wants the government to free all prisoners convicted of 
politically motivated crimes stop police from firing on black 
protesters and end the state of emergency in the natal province 
where anc supporters are battling members of the rival inkatha 
organization 
when those conditions are met he says the anc and the 
government can enter into negotiations apparently including other 
political organizations to develop a new nonracial democratic 
constitution based on a oneperson onevote system 
current tour mandela is in the midst of a sixweek tour of 
africa europe and north america to thank the world for pressuring 
the south african government to remove the ban on the anc and free 
him and his colleagues 
he also is urging that economic cultural diplomatic and sports 
sanctions be maintained against south africa until apartheid is 
completely abolished

after 198 years of trading stocks only during 
the daytime the new york stock exchange plans to phase in a 
24hour market by the end of the decade to meet increasing 
competition from overseas 
big board chairman john j phelan jr on thursday unveiled a 
fivestep plan expected to begin later this year that would allow 
access to the nations largest exchange after the current 4 pm 
eastern time close 
there is some volume going overseas and wed like to capture 
some of that volume back phelan said in nashville tenn where 
he was meeting with officials from a regional brokerage 
roundtheclock trading is already a reality in the foreign 
currency and us treasury bond market where dealers conduct 
transactions via telephone and computer links 
but the concept has stirred controversy at the stock exchange 
because it could lead to replacing the powerful specialists 
who today regulate the flow of trading with computers 
its an incredible surprise one veteran specialist who 
asked not to be named said the incredible thing is that the 
floor hasnt lynched anyone yet 
nevertheless the exchange has been pressured by new technology 
and competing markets that allow traders to buy and sell big 
boardlisted stocks domestically and abroad when the nyse is closed 
the london exchange which eliminated its specialists and 
trading floor when it went electronic four years ago and the tokyo 
market have siphoned the most business 
the steps outlined by phelan would begin with two brief sessions 
after the markets normal close subsequent phases would involve 
stock auctions held several times a night some form of 
conventional trading overnight and finally 24hour dealing 
market experts said that by phasing in the plan the nyse could 
stimulate afterhours interest the exchange could determine for 
instance whether the floor should stay open roundtheclock or 
whether afterhours trading be strictly electronic 
the limiting factor here is the demand its not the 
technology said eric k clemons a professor at the university 
of pennsylvanias wharton school what if you had a 24hour 
market and nobody came 
what the nyse wants to do is make sure institutions feel they 
have no choice that if they want to trade a major us stock 
the only place to trade is new york he said 
exchange officials said they planned to implement the first two 
phases of the plan by the end of the year assuming member firms 
agree this level would involve sessions that could last one to two 
hours and handle activity mainly related to program trading 
in the third phase expected to begin in 1991 the exchange 
would hold auctions of each listed stock at 8 pm midnight and 5 
am eastern time each stock would trade once at each auction with 
trades combined at a single price more than 1700 stocks are 
listed on the exchange and all could be included in the auctions 
phelan said the fourth phase would involve some sort of 
rudimentary trading during the night it could begin by 1992 
the final step nonstop roundtheclock trading is five to 
10 years off exchange officials said 
im not skeptical about it long term but i think short term 
there is a serious question whether there is a lot out there and 
thats what were proposing to do with steps phelan said 
current trading hours are 930 am to 4 pm eastern time 
trading ran from 10 am to 3 pm on weekdays and 10 am to noon 
on saturdays from 1873 until 1952 when weekend trading was 
abolished and weekday activity extended until 330 pm an extra 
half hour was added in 1974 and 1985 
market players estimate the nyse has lost 10 million to 20 
million shares a day of trading to foreign markets where many us 
companies now list their securities also other domestic markets 
that offer afterhours trading via computer pose a threat 
big board volume has slumped since the stock market crashed in 
1987 and has averaged about 156 million shares daily this year 
several wall street professionals questioned whether there is 
enough demand to sustain afterhours trading they said an attempt 
merely to regain volume lost to london might fail because certain 
trades there can be conducted with less public scrutiny 
others said afterhours trading could grow once a system is in 
place 
the very fact that its available might encourage more and 
other types of activities said jack a conlon jr managing 
director in charge of equities for rothschild inc

a west german computer executive has agreed to 
settle us civil charges of using inside information to avoid a 
2000 stock loss 
the executive lives in germany but worked for an american 
company and was charged with illegal insider trading in the 
companys shares 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing wolfgang marcour of 
wiesbaden west germany settled a civil complaint filed thursday 
by the securities and exchange commission at federal court in 
washington 
it was the second small insider trading case the sec brought 
this week against foreign nationals 
on monday a new york banker and his bondtrader wife both 
japanese nationals agreed to pay 99000 in penalties and 
restitution to settle unrelated insider trader charges 
unlike marcour they both lived in this country 
marcour 47 agreed to pay the us government 2062 in trading 
losses he avoided as well as 358 in interest 
marcours west german lawyer michael siebold was traveling and 
could not be reached for comment sec officials said 
according to the sec complaint marcour who lives and works in 
west germany sold 500 shares of apollo computer inc stock in july 
1988 allegedly with knowledge that apollos sales for that 
quarter would be significantly lower than expected 
at the time marcour was an international sales manager at 
apollos wholly owned european subsidiary apollo domain computer 
gmbh and handled the account of siemens ag a major west german 
electronics company 
harry j weiss an associate director of the secs enforcement 
division said marcour was subject to us securities laws because 
an employee of an american public company who happens to be based 
in a foreign country is under the same legal duties to his employer 
as an americanbased employee of the same company 
apollo computer based in chelmsford mass was acquired by 
electronics giant hewlettpackard co in may 1989 
weiss would not comment on how the sec obtained information 
about marcour the united states does not have a formal cooperation

in a reflection of the pressures facing us 
automakers a leading rating agency has lowered its credit rankings 
for chrysler corp and ford motor co 
standard amp poors corp said thursday it was downgrading the 
outstanding debt of the nations no 2 and no 3 automakers by one 
notch the action was particularly troublesome for chrysler because 
it left the struggling company with sampps lowest investment grade 
rating 
sampp said the nations big three automakers were faced with 
severe problems in a sagging market and slumping economy it left 
general motors corps rating unchanged however saying gm was 
better positioned to withstand the pressure 
the move came one day after moodys investor services inc 
another major rating agency said it was reviewing chryslers 
credit and would decide by the end of the month whether to 
downgrade the company 
chryslers stock fell 25 cents a share to 1562 on the new 
york stock exchange thursday ford was unchanged at 4637 and gm 
fell 37 cents to 4962 
chrysler has derived the bulk of earnings in recent years from 
such niche products as the minivan and sportutility vehicles 
said sampp vice president scott sprinzen and pressure from 
competing product offerings is mounting 
recently ford and gm began selling fourdoor sportutility 
vehicles that compete directly with chryslers jeeps 
sprinzen said ford was raising its capital spending which will 
force it to delay reducing the huge debt amassed in the recent 
acquisitions of the associates corp a financial organization and 
british automaker jaguar plc those two purchases cost ford nearly 
6 billion 
sampp dropped ford one notch to doubleaminus from doublea the 
new rating still is one of the agencys higher investment grades 
chrysler was dropped one notch from tripleb to triplebminus 
sampps lowest investmentgrade level anything lower and chryslers 
debt would be considered to be junk bonds 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said the downgrade was 
unwarranted 
moreover chrysler also notes that just recently the market 
readily accepted the landmark offering of 11 billion 30year 
auburn hills trust certificates thereby expressing high confidence 
in the company over a very long term houston said 
in april chrysler announced it would sell its 
yettobecompleted technical center in auburn hills north of 
detroit through 30year certificates and then lease it back the 
deal was expected to raise nearly 800 million 
chryslers first quarter profits fell 80 percent to 71 million 
sales of its north americanmade cars and trucks were down 13 
percent this year as of june 10 
the companys share of the us car market has slipped to 114 
percent from 131 percent a year ago its portion of the truck 
market dropped to 218 percent from 232 percent last year 
spokesman tom foote said ford was disappointed with sampps 
decision the companys balance sheet is strong and we expect our 
investments to lead to further strengthening of our financial 
situation he said 
ford reported first quarter earnings of 5062 million down 70 
percent from a year ago its sales of cars and trucks were down 88 
percent through june 10 the companys share of the us car market 
stood at 279 percent down from 302 percent last year its truck 
share slipped to 342 percent from 344 percent 
sprinzen said even though gm faced increased competition and the 
possibility of lower profit margins it was in a better position 
than ford or chrysler 
these problems have not reached the extent relative to gms 
current ratings that a reassessment of its credit quality is 
warranted he said 
recently auto analyst ronald glantz of dean witter reynolds 
inc in san francisco recommended that ford and chrysler investors 
switch to gm because gm was more likely to raise its stock dividend 
next year 
gms first quarter earnings fell 543 percent to 710 million 
its combined car and truck sales through june 10 were off 48 
percent from last year its share of the car market slipped nearly 
1 percentage point to 461 percent in trucks it gained to 405 
percent from 393 percent

the head of the bondholders committee for 
debtridden southland corp remains optimistic that the company can 
get back on its feet with a new sweetened restructuring plan 
one of the companys bondholders scoffed at the new plan and 
said he would reject the offer 
southland owner of 7000 7eleven convenience stores on 
thursday enhanced its debt swap proposal to bondholders the new 
plan would slash the amount of control the founding thompson family 
will have 
the company also said it would not pay 69 million in interest 
due on two bond issues today which opens up the possibility of an 
involuntary bankruptcy petition being filed against southland 
the bondholder proposal which southland called the second phase 
in its attempt to climb out from under 18 billion in debt would 
cut the stake that the thompson family and other existing 
shareholders will have to 65 percent compared with 15 percent in 
an earlier proposal 
the company is offering bondholders 550 million in exchange for 
176 billion in outstanding securities in addition bondholders 
and preferred stockholders would share 185 percent of the 
companys common stock 
the new offer would give bondholders about 200 million more 
than an earlier plan 
the first phase of the restructuring announced in march called 
for southlands japanese partners itoyokado co ltd and 
seveneleven japan co ltd to pay 400 million cash for 75 
percent of the company but the japanese investors agreed to hold 
off consummating that deal until august 15 pending a debt 
restructuring 
assuming an agreement can be reached over the next couple of 
days the hope is that a specific proposal would be filed with the 
sec securities and exchange commission by about the middle of 
next week said john gordon president of deltec securities corp 
of new york and head of a bondholders committee that worked out the 
agreement with southland management and others 
gordon said he was enthusiastic about the negotiations and 
said it provided an opportunity for southland to really get back 
on its feet 
suffering disappointing sales and earnings growth southland has 
been strained by debt associated with its 49 billion leveraged 
buyout in 1987 which gave dallas thompson family control of the 
chain 
the company lost 694 million in the first quarter it 
completed the sale of its citgo subsidiary in january to raise 
6615 million in cash the initial 350 million bond buyout offer 
was made shortly after that sale 
gordon called the initial offer totally unacceptable but 
said he was impressed with the negotiations this week that led to 
the improved offer 
at least one other bondholder was not as enthusiastic 
its incredible the size of the pill that theyre asking 
bondholders to swallow said jay h lustig head of the high 
yield department for drake capital securities inc of santa monica 
calif 
theyre asking bondholders to forgive 12 billion in debt in 
exchange for 18 percent of the company they have absolutely zero 
shot of getting 100 percent acceptance he said 
a missed interest payment friday raises the possibility that 
southland could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy if a payment 
or agreement is not worked out in 30 days lustig said 
gordon said he was optimistic the parties would reach an 
agreement that would avoid such a move lustig was not 
i know one bond holder whos not tendering the bonds he 
said youre talking to him

prosecutors have arrested four men accused of 
evading taxes on profits made on the stock of the company that was 
the target of the first hostile takeover in japans corporate 
history 
the four apparently profited from inside information on the 
takeover attempt prosecutors said but because the transactions 
occurred before japan tightened insider trading regulations in 
april 1988 they were arrested only on suspicion of tax evasion 
the prosecutors said thursday 
the four were arrested last wednesday and prosecutors searched 
their homes and offices thursday 
the tokyo district public prosecutors office said the four 
allegedly concealed income totaling the equivalent of 101 million 
from stock transactions in 1987 in shares of kokusai kogyo a 
tokyobased aerial surveying firm 
kokusai kogyo was taken over in december 1987 by the koshin co 
known for its stock speculation activities 
when the takeover attempt began in may 1987 kokusai kogyo 
shares were trading at about 2000 yen or 13 in an effort to 
maintain control kokusai kogyo began buying back shares by 
october 1987 the price had soared to 7000 yen or 4560 
prosecutors identified those arrested as norio ishibashi 49 
hiromitsu hamaguchi 50 and yoshinori wakisaka 47 all former 
officials of kokusai kogyo also arrested was eiji sakai 53 a 
financial firm president 
prosecutors also said they were searching for jiro tomishima 
39 president of a subsidiary of kokusai kogyo on suspicion of tax 
evasion 
a senior official at the prosecutors office speaking on 
condition of anonymity said we are certain that he is out of 
country but we cannot say at this point whether we have sent our 
investigators overseas nor have we requested cooperation from 
foreign investigatory agencies 
ishibashi who was in control of kokusai kogyos accounting 
bought more than 500000 shares for himself during the takeover 
battle and netted a profit of about 397 million prosecutors 
said they said the other three arrested men earned profits ranging 
from 169 million to 208 million 
the four used dummy accounts to dodge taxation prosecutors

and faculty members at the university of houstons college of 
business administration in an effort to get its shares listed on 
the new york stock exchange 
i thought it was like the promise of receiving a free gift for 
attending a timeshare vacation resort said dale rude associate

i read it and was amused and put it aside said doctoral

kent a 17yearold company with annual revenues of about 40 
million met all but one of the standards for listing the one

consumers who are worried about the ozone or 
overcrowded landfills will soon be able to look for a new 
environmental seal of approval when deciding what to buy in the 
supermarket 
an independent nonprofit organization called green seal will 
test products for their cradletograve impact on the 
environment and award seals a bold green check arched over a blue 
globe to those that meet its standards 
were trying to harness the most powerful forces we have 
available in the united states the forces of the marketplace to 
try to achieve environmental goals denis hayes chairman of 
earth day 1990 and chairman and chief executive officer of green 
seal said thursday 
at a news conference at the new york academy of sciences he 
said green seal will start early next year by awarding seals in 
five product categories light bulbs laundry cleaners house 
paint toilet paper and facial tissue 
these products were selected because they are used in almost 
every household in the country and some are clearly friendlier to 
the environment than others said norman dean the programs 
executive director 
hayes said green seal will not issue seals for food 
in april the american heart association yanked its seal of 
approval program for foods low in sodium cholesterol and saturated 
fats after the federal food and drug administration said it would 
not support the program 
the fda said what goes on food labels is a government 
responsibility 
green seal inc was founded last year by rena m shulsky a 
partner in a manhattan real estate firm and president of a 
bostonbased media consulting firm she said she came up with the 
idea while standing in a grocery store aisle wondering which 
laundry detergent would be friendlier to the environment 
i thought why doesnt someone put a seal on these things a 
little seal of approval would help me get out of the supermarket a 
lot quicker 
green seals first task will be to determine the standards by 
which the products will be judged said dean in doing so it will 
examine the full life cycle of each product category from raw 
material to when the consumer recycles it or throws it into the 
garbage 
the organization intends to solicit advice from manufacturers of 
the products public interest organizations trade associations and 
government officials in establishing its criteria for awarding 
seals 
once the standards are set companies at their own cost may 
submit their products for testing by independent laboratories 
selected by green seal 
products that get the green seal check of approval will be 
licensed to use the seal logo in their advertising for a threeyear 
period the licensing fees will be structured on a sliding scale to 
prevent hardship for smaller companies 
according to a poll conducted by research amp forecasts inc for 
green seal 79 percent of those surveyed said they would be more 
likely to purchase a product with the green seal if choosing 
between two products of the same price and equal quality 
green seal is not the first sealofapproval program for 
environmentally preferable products west germany has had a program 
for 10 years canada for three years and japan for a couple of 
years hayes said 
also green cross certification co based in oakland calif 
launched an environmental certification program for products in 
april with three west coast grocery chains and one in phoenix 
three food chains in the northeast and canada will join the 
program in july said stan rhodes president of green cross

the koito manufacturing co labor union on friday 
denounced an attempt by texas oilman t boone pickens to get a seat 
on the companys board of directors 
it was the first time the union had publicly denounced pickens 
who controls the largest equity stake in koito and several 
proposals he intends to submit to a shareholders meeting later this 
month 
the union is against the proposals because they ignore the 
companys responsibility to take care of its employees union 
chairman hideki yoshioka said in a statement 
koitos labor union resolved thursday that it is against all 
seven of pickens proposals which will be voted on at the 
companys june 28 shareholders meeting because they would 
destabilize koito employees living conditions if they are 
approved said the union chief 
among the proposals are a demand that four americans including 
pickens be appointed to koitos board of directors they also call 
for publication of the companys pricing policies according to 
kanji ishizumi pickens lawyer 
last week pickens mailed letters and videos to about 4100 
koito shareholders asking for stockholder proxies for the vote on 
his proposals 
yoshioka called pickens proposals greenmail or buying up a 
companys shares in an attempt to force it or a friendly affiliate 
to buy them back at a higher price to regain control 
he said the union wants board members from koito who are 
familiar with the company operation and will be understood by 
employees 
according to koito spokesman mikio tsuruta koito shareholders 
have recently received some harassing newsletters from a group 
that seems to have links with the underworld although were not 
certain if pickens is involved 
sokaiya or professional racketeers use their legal right as 
shareholders to attend general shareholders meetings where they 
threaten to embarrass the company if they are not paid off 
beforehand 
of the more than 4000 shareholders only about 100 normally 
attend shareholders meetings with many of the rest sending 
proxies tsuruta said 
since his boone co a us investment firm obtained the 
largest equity stake in koito last year pickens has been fighting 
unsuccessfully against koito management in an attempt to gain a 
seat on the board of directors 
pickens has said his battle with koito illustrates how 
investment opportunities are closed to foreigners in japan but the 
company says it is concerned about pickens true intentions

honeywell inc has asked the government to 
ban imports of autofocus cameras made by minolta camera co ltd of 
japan alleging that the cameras infringe on four honeywell patents 
a lawsuit filed by honeywell against minolta in 1987 is still 
about two years from trial honeywell officials said thursday in 
hopes of getting relief more quickly honeywell asked the 
international trade commission to act christopher j steffen 
honeywells chief financial officer told a news conference in 
washington dc 
today with its extremely popular maxxum camera minolta 
enjoys annual worldwide sales of 1 billion on its camera products 
while honeywell is denied millions of dollars in royalties as our 
lawsuit moves very slowly through the courts steffen said 
in addition to the maxxum minoltas aftele and freedom dual 
models would be affected 
the minneapolisbased international controls company asked the 
itc to step in under a 1988 amendment of the tariff act of 1930 
the law makes it illegal for overseas companies to engage in unfair 
methods of competition including infringing on us patents when 
importing or selling products in the united states 
the 1987 lawsuit filed in federal court in new jersey on a 
change of venue from minnesota says minolta used four honeywell 
patents in minolta cameras including the slr maxxum 
honeywell also contends that minolta breached a 1979 contract 
calling for honeywell to share patented technology and trade 
secrets minolta was restricted to using only 
honeywellmanufactured autofocus modules under the contract 
honeywell said 
instead honeywell alleges minolta used honeywell autofocus 
technology while developing a module of its own 
minolta said thursday that honeywells patent claims are 
invalid and unenforceable in a statement issued through its 
new jersey office minolta also said that federal court was the 
proper forum for this dispute and it called the original 
allegations baseless 
minolta also said honeywells petition violates a 1988 agreement 
by both parties that federal court in new jersey would be the 
exclusive forum for resolving the dispute 
we today asked the federal court to uphold this agreement and 
order honeywell to withdraw its complaint minolta said 
honeywell however said minoltas allegations are unfounded 
honeywell said the 1988 agreement was meant to discourage multiple 
court filings and not to affect an administrative action such as an 
itc filing 
the trade agency has 30 days to decide whether it will review 
the case said honeywell spokeswoman susan eich if it does a 
decision could come within a year she said 
ed carroll an itc spokesman said that if the itc agrees to 
investigate the case would be heard by an administrative law 
judge who would make an initial determination to the commission 
the commission then would decide whether to accept the judges 
determination if it does that decision would go to president bush 
the president has 60 days to do something with it if he does 
nothing at all the commission decision stands and would 
automatically go into effect carroll said

usair operations at greater pittsburgh 
international airport are under federal scrutiny for possible 
antitrust violations according to the airlines parent company 
the us justice department ordered usair group inc to turn 
over documents and other information relating to usair activities 
at the airport where it is the largest tenant the request came 
may 31 in an action known as a civil investigative demand usair 
said 
the existence of the probe was disclosed by usair in connection 
with the issuance of 846 million in revenue bonds for the 
construction of a new terminal being built at the airport usair 
said it was informed by the justice department that other airlines 
and other airports are being investigated 
the names of the other carriers and airports were not disclosed 
justice department spokesman frank kelly declined to comment on 
the nature of the investigation he said a civil investigative 
demand is equivalent to a subpoena but does not mean a civil or 
criminal action has been undertaken 
usair spokesman john bronson said the airline would comply with 
the justice departments request and was gathering all relevant 
documents he said he did not know the exact nature of the justice 
department inquiry 
the solicitor for allegheny county which has a business 
relationship with usair relating to the new terminal said the 
request for information appears to be part of a broader probe the 
investigation likely involves fares charged by airlines at hub 
airports said ira weiss 
a report issued last year by the federal general accounting 
office found that fares charged at 15 hub airports were about 
onefourth higher than fares charged at 38 other airports served by 
a larger number of carriers 
the study found that fares charged at pittsburgh were as much as 
8 cents per mile more than fares at the 38 airports 
weiss said one aspect of the usair probe involves its dealings 
with the county the airline and the county negotiated a longterm 
lease two years ago for the construction of the new 592 million 
terminal 
any time you have the justice department conducting an inquiry 
of this nature its a cause for alarm weiss said 
theres no reason to believe theres anything inappropriate 
about usairs role at the existing terminal or at the new midfield 
terminal and were confident at the conclusion of this proceeding 
that things will proceed as they are he added 
according to the bond statement the justice department is 
examining possible violations of the sherman act by conduct 
activities or proposed action relating to restrictions on 
facilities at the airport 
the sherman act makes it illegal for companies to restrain trade 
in the united states or with foreign countries or to conspire to do 
so it also prohibits monopolizing trade or commerce in the united 
states or with foreign countries or attempting or conspiring to do 
so 
weiss said he thought the investigation arose out of usairs 
large share of traffic at the pittsburgh airport 
in 1987 the justice department opposed the merger of usair and 
piedmont airlines but dropped its objections after determining the 
consolidation would not hurt competition

commodity futures trading commissioner fowler 
west was unfazed by a pair of studies concluding the cftcs 
proposed curbs on dual trading are based on flawed research methods 
and insufficient data 
you could probably go on and on and on and on and find 
academics who would quarrel with certain conclusions and methods 
west said thursday after the studies authors presented their 
findings to the cftc staff in washington 
their objections seem to me to be highly technical in 
nature west said in a telephone interview from his washington 
office 
the studies by researchers at the university of california at 
berkeley and duke university were funded by the nations eight 
major commodity exchanges whose leaders are fighting the cftc plan 
the findings may provide the exchanges with more ammunition with 
which to defend dual trading the controversial but legal practice 
among floor brokers of trading for their customers accounts and 
their own at the same time 
west said the objections would be considered along with other 
public comments the cftc has gathered since announcing its proposal 
in january the public comment period ends july 9 
critics contend dual trading provides opportunities for brokers 
to cheat their clients but exchange leaders say the practice 
increases market liquidity and cost efficiency 
a study of dual trading conducted last year by the cftc disputed 
the purported economic benefits of dual trading 
the cftc in january proposed a test ban on dual trading in 
certain markets a move the exchanges viewed as the first step 
toward outlawing the practice 
the exchangesponsored studies examined the process that led to 
the cftc proposal and found it flawed 
the duke researchers complaints included accusations of 
measurement errors and inconsistencies in the cftc study the 
berkeley analysis said the cftc failed to weigh dual tradings 
benefits against the costs and ignored its functional effects on 
markets 
these deficiencies undermine the studys conclusions as well 
as its use as a basis for dualtrading curbs the researchers 
said 
their conclusions were in a statement issued jointly by the 
chicago board of trade the chicago mercantile exchange and six 
other major us commodity exchanges 
the chicago mercantile exchange has proposed its own 
lesssevere curbs on dual trading as an alternative to the cftc 
plan 
spokesman andrew yemma said he saw no conflict between the 
mercs proposed dualtrading restrictions and its support for the 
two university studies

the us trade deficit shrank dramatically to 
694 billion in april the second lowest level in the past six 
years the government reported today 
the commerce department said the 17 percent improvement from a 
march deficit of 836 billion came entirely from a big drop in 
imports which offset a smaller decline in us export sales 
imports totaled 3925 billion in april 62 percent lower than 
march with the decline attributed primarily to lower demand for 
foreign oil and a big drop in auto imports 
exports fell by 35 percent to 323 billion but this was 
considered only a small drop off an alltime high of 335 billion 
set in march 
americas trade performance has been a pleasant surprise so far 
this year with the deficit showing a much larger improvement than 
many analysts thought possible 
through the first four months the deficit has been running at 
an annual rate of 9216 billion compared to a deficit for all of 
1989 of 10899 billion 
many analysts are now forecasting that the 1990 deficit will 
drop below 100 billion for the first time since 1983 as export 
growth remains strong enough to offset a growing dependence on 
foreign oil 
that would spell good news for the bush administration which is 
counting on a strong trade performance to keep the economy out of a 
recession over the past three years fully onethird of overall 
us economic growth has been supplied by surging export sales 
the april deficit of 694 billion was the smallest since a 
february imbalance of 610 billion with both months turning in the 
best trade performance since a 57 billion imbalance in december 
1983 
for april both oil imports and auto imports were down by about 
1 billion each 
the 20 percent drop in oil imports to a total of 375 billion 
reflected a drop in the volume of shipments and price 
america imported 755 billion barrels a day down from 842 
billion in march while the average price per barrel fell to 
1657 down from 1818 
imports of foreign cars declined by 16 percent to 368 billion 
with shipments from japan leading the decline 
on the export side there were small declines in a number of 
categories including a 150 million falloff in computer shipments 
a 200 million decline in shipments of telecommunications equipment 
and a 130 million drop in us shipments of aircraft engines 
as usual the biggest deficit was with japan a 4 billion 
imbalance up from a 36 billion deficit in march 
the united states actually posted a surplus with western europe 
of 14 billion double the march surplus 
other deficits included 800 million with taiwan and 600 
million with china which recently won a oneyear extension on its 
mostfavorednation lower tariffs from the bush administration

japan and the united states are going down to the 
wire on talks that experts say could make a real difference in the 
long run to reduce japans fat trade surplus 
foreign minister taro nakayama travels to the united states 
today for talks with secretary of state james a baker iii in san 
francisco ten days later trade negotiators from the two countries 
meet in tokyo 
the goal is to work out the final report on the structural 
impediments initiative the plan to revamp japans economic 
structure and increase the availability of imported products 
for 15 years japan talked about opening the market for 
individual items and the trade balance got worse said economist 
richard c koo of the nomura research institute 
for the next five years they tried adjusting exchange 
rates and that didnt work either structural changes are the only 
thing left he said 
the us commerce department said the trade imbalance with japan 
was 49 billion last year down from a record 563 billion in 1987 
but still huge compared to 1980s 99 billion 
the goal of the economic talks is to strengthen an april interim 
report hailed by both countries as a success 
at that time japan agreed to increase public works spending 
reform its complex distribution system to make it easier for large 
retail stores to break in crack down on monopolies and work on 
lowering land prices all the reforms should make japan more 
accessible to imports 
since then prime minister toshiki kaifu has expressed 
displeasure with us pressure to extend the reforms beyond what 
japan promised while us officials have charged japan with 
reneging on its promises 
koo said one impetus for change is the japanese people they are 
demanding imports indicating japan is evolving into an 
international consumer society after 40 years of managed trade and 
sacrificing to build production he said 
the rise in consumerism is reflecting in a declining savings 
rate said economist susumu kato of goldman sachs the rate is now 
about 16 percent of income compared with about 24 percent in the 
1970s thats still well above the us rate of about 5 percent 
the rise of the yen in recent years has helped reduce the trade 
imbalance by making exports more expensive and us imports cheaper 
here the dollar fell from an average 249 yen in 1985 to 127 yen in 
january 1989 
the dollar has rebounded averaging nearly 154 yen in may that 
has helped decrease the trade surplus temporarily by raising the 
dollar value of imports but economists worry that in the long run 
the yens weakness will worsen the trade deficit 
japan actually increased its exports to the united states 45 
percent last year the commerce department said but the surplus 
fell because the united states increased its exports to japan by 
182 percent to 446 billion 
some of the increase came in products that the united states had 
been trying to get into japan for years 
us beef imports rose 38 percent to 879 million computers 
were up 79 percent to 2 billion and wood was up 37 percent to 35 
billion according to the japan external trade organization 
us industry officials caution that while the percentage 
figures look impressive they arise from small bases huge 
imbalances remain in motor vehicles and electronics each worth 
about 20 billion a year to japan 
kato predicts japans surplus with the us wont drop below 15 
billion to 20 billion even if negotiations succeed in opening the 
japanese market completely 
we supply vcrs computers all kinds of electronic products 
he said as long as the demand exists well export

president bush will keep his pledge to veto 
legislation requiring employers to give workers up to three months 
unpaid leave for family emergencies his spokesman said today 
the senate gave final approval to the family leave bill in a 
voice vote thursday night after brief debate 
passage the culmination of a fouryear effort by supporters 
was a bit anticlimactic republican opponents conceded they could 
not defeat the housepassed bill and did not seek a recorded vote 
at the white house bush was asked this morning during a photo 
session whether he would veto the legislation as the white house 
had threatened 
bush did not reply but his press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said yes when asked the same question as reporters filed out 
of the photo session with paraguays president andres rodriguez 
the remark immediately drew a complaint from the bills chief 
republican sponsor rep marge roukema rnj who called the bill 
a bedrock family issue 
the political implications i think are very dicey roukema 
said in a telephone interview 
the point that has to be considered here is do we want to be 
perceived as the party that fights for a reduction in the capital 
gains tax while we turn our backs on taxpaying hardworking 
american families who are in medical crisis she said 
bush according to his spokesmen supports voluntary leave but 
contends that forcing employers to provide the leave amounts to 
excessive government intervention in the workplace 
democrats confident that the measure is popular with voters 
immediately sought to turn up the political pressure on bush to 
sign the bill 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine quoted from one 
of bushs own 1988 campaign speeches in which he seemed to support 
just such employee leave guarantees 
he quoted bush as saying we also need to ensure that women 
dont have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a 
child or caring for a child after a serious illness 
its time to see if president bush advocates the same policies 
as president as he did on the campaign trail when he sought the 
presidency in 1988 said mitchell dmaine 
sen christopher dodd dconn the bills sponsor said in an 
interview that he would try to meet with bush to urge he sign the 
measure dodd noted that the public veto threats were delivered by 
bushs spokesmen and aides 
he has not personally said anything dodd said id like 
to go meet with him and make my case we think weve got a strong 
case to make here 
opponents said they were counting on a presidential veto and 
were confident they had the votes to sustain a veto in the house 
the bill passed comfortably in the house last month although 
the margin fell 46 votes short of the twothirds majority that 
would be needed to override a veto 
there simply are not the votes available to us to frustrate 
passage said sen thad cochran rmiss an opponent of the 
bill we concede the senates will is to pass this bill 
tonight weve lost 
the bill requires business and government employers to provide 
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or leave for 
the care of a newly born or adopted child or an ill child parent 
or spouse 
it exempts businesses with fewer than 50 workers and workers 
who are the highestpaid 10 percent within a company 
employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for 
those on leave and restore a returning employee to his or her 
previous job or an equivalent position 
business groups have strongly opposed the bill their lobbyists 
met with white house chief of staff john sununu on may 7 and said 
he promised them bush would veto the bill if sent to his desk 
presidential spokesmen later repeated the veto threat 
senate passage came after leaders worked out a bipartisan 
agreement to take up the bill quickly and avoid a roll call vote 
dodd joked that he had come ready for a floor fight and was a bit 
disappointed by the lack of one 
ive learned long ago you dont argue about a victory when you 
get one he said im also convinced that had it come to a 
recorded vote we would have prevailed 
dodd acknowledged he might not have enough votes in the senate 
to override a veto but said he was close 
opponents contend the bill would be costly and burdensome for 
businesses and represents a government intrusion into affairs best 
left to business and labor supporters said nearly all 
industrialized nations already provide such minimum job security to 
workers and many have provisions for full or partial pay 
the bill also would cover federal employees with even more 
generous leave provisions it would cover house employees but not 
employees of the senate

falling vegetable and fuel oil prices in may 
held consumer inflation to a modest 02 percent for the second 
consecutive month the government said today 
for the first five months of the year the labor departments 
consumer price index has advanced at an annual rate of 58 percent 
thats up significantly from the 46 rate for all of last year but 
down sharply from the worrisome 85 percent rate in the first 
quarter 
the good news was expected by most economists who said prices 
are recovering from a cold weather jolt at the beginning of the 
year 
just as first quarter inflation was overstated inflation in 
april and may was understated said economist michael k evans 
a washingtonbased consultant were almost sure price increases 
are going to get bigger again next month 
in other economic news the commerce department said the us 
trade deficit shrank dramatically to 694 billion in april the 
second lowest level in the past six years many analysts are now 
forecasting that the 1990 deficit will drop below 100 billion for 
the first time since 1983 
according to the federal reserve industrial production 
rebounded an unexpectedly strong 06 percent in may after no change 
in april an earlier estimate by the central bank had showed 
production falling in april the operating rate of the nations 
factories mines and utilities rose 03 percentage point to 836 
percent in may 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that despite 
the temporary increase in the first quarter over the last 12 
months consumer prices have increased 44 percent inflation 
remains low and under control 
as for the trade figures he noted that the deficit in the first 
four months of the year was 10 percent lower than in the same 
period of 1989 this is an encouraging downward trend 
fitzwater said 
todays mild inflation report which was anticipated and the 
strong industrial production report a surprise combined to push 
bond prices lower in early trading this morning 
traders took the reports as a sign that inflation has not yet 
moderated enough nor the economy weakened sufficiently to cause the 
federal reserve board to relax its tight monetary policy and allow 
shortterm interest rates to fall 
the labor department said price of fruit and vegetables fell 24 
percent the third substantial drop in a row vegetables soared 
292 percent in the first two months of the year before falling 
236 percent in the next three months 
food overall in may rose just 01 percent after edging down 02 
percent in april 
dairy product costs fell for the third consecutive month in may 
while prices were up for sweets fats and oils and beverages 
energy prices fell 07 percent the fourth monthly decline 
following a large increase in january fuel oil fell 14 percent 
and natural gas 27 percent however electricity charges rose 1 
percent 
gasoline prices rose modestly but less than usual for the start 
of the warm weather driving season thus after seasonal 
adjustment gasoline prices were reported down 16 percent 
excluding the often volatile food and energy sectors prices 
rose a moderate 03 percent following a 02 percent rise in april 
economists consider this socalled core rate a better indication of 
underlying inflation because it moves less erratically 
new car prices edged down 02 percent the fourth consecutive 
decline in the face of sluggish sales 
apparel prices which had been up sharply earlier in the year 
because a warm february got spring sales off to an early start 
fell 03 percent last month the price of mens clothing rose 04 
percent but womens and childrens clothing fell 1 percent and 22 
percent respectively 
the price of medical care jumped 08 percent in may for the 
fourth consecutive month pushing those costs 9 percent higher than 
a year ago 
the various changes put the index for all consumer prices at 
1292 in may that means a hypothetical selection of goods and 
services costing 100 in the 198284 base period cost 12920 last 
month up from 12380 a year ago 
wholesale prices which rose 03 percent in may have behaved 
more moderately than consumer prices the labor departments 
producer price index is up at only a 4 percent annual rate so far 
this year down from 48 percent for all of last year 
economists point to the different composition of the two indexes 
as an explanation for their divergence the producer index is 
composed entirely of prices for goods while services account for 
about 55 percent of the consumer index 
because unemployment remains low at 53 percent over most of 
the last year services and the cost of services have been less 
affected by the economic slowdown engineered by the central bank 
todays release of consumer prices is the earliest in 30 years 
according to labor department analyst patrick jackman the report 
is usually released around the 27th of the month but increasing 
use of computers is allowing the department to release it earlier 
he said 
this months producer report released thursday came out a bit 
later than usual as a result the two reports were issued on 
consecutive days for the first time in recent memory

retail sales are down and installment credit 
has begun to cool housing starts are off too and cars arent 
selling at rates envisioned by carmakers manufacturing jobs have 
been shrinking for months 
after his usual quarterly survey of smaller businesses 
economist william dunkelberg appropriately summed up the condition 
the mood and the outlook for the economy in one terse sentence 
the economy isnt going anywhere in particular said 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business and 
management and its going anywhere at a rather slow and erratic 
pace 
the giving and taking and getting and spending of the 
marketplace has indeed slowed to a shuffle and the best thing that 
can be said for it is that after nearly eight years of expansion 
you cant expect much more 
still americans adjusted to expansion in that time and they 
didnt care how they got it by borrowing and leveraging or by 
working two jobs or by putting off having a family or sometimes by 
increasing productivity 
now that expansion is threatened they angrily try to place the 
blame on the japanese who restrict their marketplace on the 
reagan administration and its budget deficits on spendthrift 
congresses 
president bush comes in for his share and so does alan 
greenspan chairman of the federal reserve who seeks to reduce 
inflation to zero even if the shuffle becomes a crawl the weather 
gets blamed too 
it was the viciously cold weather last december you may 
remember that kept people from looking at houses to buy it was a 
rather cool spring in some areas it is said that depressed retail 
sales below expectations 
some folks even blame the commerce department contending that 
the figures are never what they seem to be after the inevitable 
revisions are completed and the seasonal adjustment factors are 
reexamined for accuracy 
while any of these reasons might possibly have something or 
other to do to some degree with slowing the expansion there are 
in contrast some very hard facts that almost certainly have much 
to do with bringing on that condition 
debt for example not just consumer debt but municipal debt 
state debt federal debt corporate debt as any householder can 
attest debt can keep things moving just as certainly as if it were 
income but then comes the limit 
big spender that it is washington seems to be calling for a 
halt the fed very definitely is many households have imposed 
their own limits banks suddenly seem appalled at their own lending 
practices and are calling in loans 
then there is corporate debt alpine dimensions of it like 
others corporations can haul around a debt burden for a long time 
expecting all the while that improving conditions will allow them 
to begin cutting it 
when that doesnt happen and when demand for products slows 
and when interest rates remain high instead of falling as they had 
anticipated then the burden becomes onerous and then more so as 
the slowdown continues 
the debt burden of corporate american soared in the 1980s to 
about 67 percent of gross national product from 47 percent in 1970 
the ratio of interest expense to corporate earnings more than 
doubled to 40 percent 
while the percentages might surprise the reasons why might not 
junk bonds after all are familiar to everyone these days before 
them most corporate takeovers mergers and leveraged buyouts 
involved bundles of debt 
in the late 1980s about half of all funds raised by 
nonfinancial companies were borrowed compare that with the two 
previous decades when threequarters of all money raised by 
americas companies was in the form of equity 
there are many big differences between debt and equity and one 
of them is that holders of corporate equity dont threaten when 
theres a recession they might sell their shares but many will 
hold steady until the skies brighten 
those who lend money do not have that same commitment they want 
their loans repaid and they dont want to hear about the bad 
weather or poor sales or the companys need to spend on machinery 
no excuses please just pay the bill with interest

donald trump begins his bestselling guide to 
entrepreneurial success the art of the deal by declaring i 
dont do it for the money ive got enough much more than ill 
ever need 
the same man lately has been telling a parade of bankers to his 
trump tower office in midtown manhattan that money about 100 
million was precisely what he needed 
after a decade of buying hotels casinos aircraft and land a 
decade in which trump came to personify the rich braggart and 
shameless selfpromoter hes been slowed down by simple math hes 
taking in less than he needs to finance his debts 770000 a week 
less according to forbes magazine 
the bankers seem willing to help trump but given a drop in 
the value of the 44yearold developers manhattan real estate and 
in the tenuous revenue projections from his atlantic city casinos 
not entirely on his terms 
trump had to put up new collateral and hes trying to sell the 
yacht the plane and the helicopters said a source familiar with 
trumps affairs who spoke on the condition of anonymity you 
know the smaller assets 
his situation worsened by the end of last week when he missed a 
payment on bonds used to finance one casino and reportedly faced 
growing reluctance by some key lenders over granting him at least 
60 million in additional credit 
whatever its resolution trumps cash crunch threatens his 
prized ability to control his empire do his deals indulge in his 
extravagances 
above all it has weakened his most impressive edifice his 
legend which lured tourists to his hotels gamblers to his 
casinos celebrities to his manhattan apartment towers it may even 
have led bankers to give too much credit for his own good 
people tend to be mesmerized by his personality and his 
attitude and his record says benjamin schore real estate 
professor at columbia universitys business school sure bankers 
are affected by it theyre human 
the story of donald j trump has been told many times often by 
donald j trump how he dreamed of expanding his fathers real 
estate business how he obtained tax breaks and built the grand 
hyatt hotel when no one else was building anything in manhattan 
how he snapped up the site for trump tower how he wore burgundy 
suits 
whatever his taste young trump was by most accounts a 
singleminded hardworking developer unlike some older and more 
successful competitors he wasnt afraid to get his patent leather 
shoes which matched his suits dirty at construction sites 
trump also developed a reputation for hiring the best people and 
paying them accordingly and for financing his projects by taking 
on partners 
he put his name on everything he built or bought the name 
sells trump once said its all a game really 
in the mid1980s bargains became more scarce and trump 
increasingly paid top prices to buy and fix whatever he wanted 
including the plaza hotel the eastern airlines shuttle service and 
the unfinished taj mahal casino 
trump operated on two assumptions that the new york real estate 
he owned got more valuable by the day and that any other 
acquisitions would soar in value if adorned with his name 
banks happily helped when trump bought what became the trumps 
castle casino from hilton hotels a group of banks lent him the 
down payment and gave him a fiveyear grace period for the first 
repayment 
bankers have all this money coming in theyve got to get it 
out in loans and theyve got to get it back said schore 
explaining why banks such as citibank and chase manhattan loaned to 
trump so eagerly 
what trump calls the beat up trump months began in february 
because of a dispute with his wife not his bankers donald and 
ivana trump were breaking up mrs trumps determination to seek a 
large share of her husbands assets focused attention on their real 
worth 
trump kept a straight face even when he scrapped free coffee on 
the trump shuttle and announced it was for sale a year after he 
bought it cash is king he announced explaining that he wanted 
to be able to grab bargains as prices dropped 
then forbes magazine reported trumps worth which it had 
estimated at 17 billion in 1989 had sagged to about 500 million 
publicly trump was ridiculing the article privately he was 
calling bankers for more cash his problem became clearer two weeks 
ago when banking sources confirmed he was conferring with lenders 
who wanted more collateral 
new york tabloids covered that story like they did trumps 
marital mess the newly opened taj mahal which trump had touted as 
the eighth wonder of the world was called the eighth blunder 
of the world 
trumps denunciations of others for his problems betrayed the 
strain he faced when a brokerage analyst questioned trumps taj 
revenue projections he threatened to sue the brokerage the 
analyst was fired when reporters asked him about disappointing 
shuttle and casino revenues he blamed employees including two 
respected casino executives who had died in a helicopter crash 
trumps reputation for commanding staff loyalty also suffered 
with the resignation of jack odonnell president of the trump 
plaza casino who said he was sick of trumps interference 
for example odonnell said one weekend in may trump stalked a 
baccarat pit watching a japanese gambler who had won more than 6 
million in february the gambler eventually lost 10 million and 
trump cut him off before he had a chance to recover the guest 
stormed off to another casino 
in a business where youre never supposed to sweat the 
action trumps behavior reflected inexperience odonnell said 
trumps attitude toward wealthy japanese emerged as another 
liability that some said could haunt him in his heyday trump would 
blast the japanese as economic exploiters the next minute hed say 
their desire for manhattan real estate made his own properties 
extremely valuable 
but now weary of japanbashing by trump and others japanese 
investors are increasingly reluctant to buy wellknown american 
properties this has narrowed the field of affluent buyers whom 
trump may need some day 
trump is by no means finished especially if the taj mahal 
meets his expectations nor is he the only developer under pressure 
in the economically depressed northeast 
trump is going to be in exceptionally good company predicts 
michael cohen a real estate expert 
most of the developers and bankers in new york were too 
confident says schore they felt that even if they did make a 
mistake theyd be bailed out by the rising market they forgot 
about cycles 
will trump survive if i had to bet id bet on him says 
schore hes a very skilled developer and hopefully this will 
teach him to avoid too much financing 
but as he tries to extricate himself by selling stalling or 
renegotiating trump must face a reality he described in the art 
of the deal the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is 
seem desperate to make it that makes the other guy smell blood 
and then youre dead

pathe communications corp still 
trying to arrange financing for its 12 billion bid for mgmua 
communications co today extended its tender offer to june 22 one 
day before the deals final deadline 
it was the second weeklong extension of the offer by pathe a 
producer and distributor of movies controlled by italian financier 
giancarlo paretti parretti earlier had extended the deadline until 
friday 
whether and how parretti can finance the deal has been the 
subject of tremendous speculation he previously tried and failed 
to buy smaller hollywood companies the offer expires on june 23 
according to his agreement with mgmua and tracinda corp the 
holding company through which beverly hills billionaire kirk 
kerkorian controls mgmua 
last year a bid by the qintex group in australia to buy mgmua 
for 15 billion fell through for lack of financing qintex outbid 
media mogul rupert murdoch whose financing seemed assured by 100 
million but was unable to finance the deal 
mgmua chairman jeffrey barbakow who kerkorian has promised a 
30 million bonus when mgmua is sold declined to say if kerkorian 
would retain a 2 percent stake in mgmua kerkorian in filings 
with the securities and exchange commission has indicated he may 
do so that would reduce parrettis price by about 20 million 
jeanne ouellette an mgmua spokeswoman said she wasnt sure 
about kerkorian retaining a stake in the company but said the deal 
was expected to go through even if it comes down to the final 
deadline 
the outside date has always been the 23rd she said 
parretti has paid 200 million in cash down payments he also 
has guaranteed mgmua 75 million in fees from distributing three 
upcoming pathe releases including the russia house with sean 
connery and michelle pfeiffer and quigley down under with tom

time warner inc has agreed to lend parretti 650 million in 
return for a lien on the united artists film library and 
distribution rights on that library and new mgm pathe and united 
artists films for 20 years 
the balance of the offer is expected to be funded by shortterm 
loans and asset sales by patheaffiliated companies in europe and 
the possible resale of mgmua stock or of new pathe shares after 
the merger

arthur w ewy was a successful accountant 
with 37 years experience when a management change forced him to 
retire from the board of gates rubber co a manufacturer of belts 
and hoses 
within six months ewy was dead of a heart attack his son 
rodger said he died of a broken heart caused by forced departure 
from the denver company that put him out to pasture like an aging 
racehorse 
some medical experts have a different term for this early 
executive mortality 
men are dying not with their boots on but with their 
retirement plans clutched in their hands said dr alan sherman 
a palo alto calif psychiatrist who has studied postretirement 
executive deaths 
g dale meyer an assistant business professor at the university 
of colorado is directing a study commissioned by mutual benefit 
life insurance co to determine if executives forced into 
retirement tend to die soon after losing power meyers team which 
includes physicians has just begun working 
were trying to see if this is folklore or if its real 
meyer said 
a number of businessmen say its real 
justin dart creator of dart industries issued a statement when 
he was 72 i want my death and my retirement to be simultaneous 
three years later in 1980 he merged his corporation with kraft 
inc and died 
armand hammer 92 chairman of occidental petroleum corp 
william c norris 78 founder of control data corp and j peter 
grace 77 chairman of wr grace amp co are all among top 
executives who refused to retire rather than relinquish power 
norris stepped down as chairman of his company four years ago but 
remains a powerful board member 
a time arrives when for a variety of possible reasons the 
successful entrepreneur thinks retirement yet being an 
entrepreneur this individual cant fathom the traditional meaning 
of the term retirement meyer said 
nothing absolutely nothing in this individuals view of the 
world relates to the retirement concept 
bureaucrats and corpocrats the corporate equivalent of 
bureaucrat place comfortable retirement as a high priority 
throughout their careers they look forward to doing nothingthey 
dream of travel golf fishing dilettantism and perhaps a hobby 
said meyer 
this is not to say that all who eagerly anticipate retirement 
do it well increasingly the emptiness of it all the unstructured 
meaningless the loss of vital interests is being viewed more 
negatively the loss of purpose it is now known can create early 
illness and even death he said 
nonetheless early executive mortality remains a medically 
undocumented syndrome although anecdotal examples of premature 
deaths after retirement have been chronicled there are plenty of 
executives who survive and thrive after getting out of the 
workaholic ratrace while relatively young 
perhaps the bestknown recent instance is that of peter lynch 
46 the widely respected manager of the highly profitable magellan 
mutual fund of fidelity investments in boston after 13 years of 
running the fund he called it quits last month to spend more time 
with his family 
still lynchs story does not reflect a more common occurence 
executives who are pushed into retirement before theyre ready 
their numbers have been growing in recent years partly because of 
the restructurings mergers and staff reductions that have reshaped 
much of american business 
moreover few companies teach potential retirees for a second 
career that might extend their useful life 
henry kates chief executive of mutual benefit life insurance 
had more than a corporate interest in doing something about it 
kates was sitting in a conference room at a phoenix hotel in 
1979 when william t earls a 69yearold company field manager and 
good friend rose to give his retirement presentation midway 
through earls died of a heart attack 
in the years that followed five more of his senior managers 
died soon after retirement 
mary ann green a spokesman for the insurance company said the 
study was commissioned to determine how companies could better 
prepare managers for retirement she said it has nothing to do with 
insurance or insurance rates 
our ceo felt not enough was being done to help these people 
who had contributed so much to the company she said he 
believes most corporations arent aware of this problem 
meyer said he plans to contact the fortune 500 companies to ask 
them for statistical figures on executives who retired successfully 
and found second careers or occupations vs those who did not and 
died early 
he said preliminary research suggests a second career may be 
crucial to former executives 
those who do not find that second challenge a second start 
are in great danger of dying sooner than their cohorts he said

the new york stock exchanges decision to phase 
in 24hour securities trading during the 1990s comes amid 
intensifying worldwide competition that is eroding the big boards 
market share 
regional stock exchanges foreign markets and independent 
electronic services offering cheaper trading are offering investors 
alternatives for trading nyse stocks 
meanwhile other exchanges and private services are offering 
offhours trading in the rush to capitalize on new technology that 
lets investors trade securities almost whenever and wherever they 
want 
anyplace else where you can trade securities represents 
competition john w bachman managing partner of the st louis 
brokerage edward d jones amp co said friday 
if the new york stock exchange is determined to remain what 
many people believe is the strongest market in the world they 
cant ignore it he said 
nyse chairman john j phelan jr on thursday unveiled a 
fivestep plan to trade securities after the exchanges traditional 
daytime hours the plan would culminate in 24hour trading by the 
end of the decade 
roundtheclock trading already is reality in the foreign 
currency and us treasury bond markets where dealers conduct 
transactions via telephone and computer links the two chicago 
futures markets plan to begin computerized extendedhours trading 
in november 
while the nyse remains by far the nations largest exchange 
and the worlds secondlargest behind tokyo its market share has 
eroded and profitability slumped in recent years 
the big board handled only 692 percent of all trades in its 
listed stocks last year an alltime low the exchanges net income 
fell to 629 million last year from 1045 million in 1988 
the nyse still dominates the volume of trades but it has lost 
significant market share to smaller regional exchanges the 
chicagobased midwest stock exchange for example last year 
accounted for 103 percent of the trading in nyse stocks up from 
333 percent in 1979 
industry experts also say erosion has occurred overseas where 
us companies are listed on foreign exchanges 
the london exchange which went electronic four years ago and 
the tokyo market have siphoned the most business in london the 
value of trading of us securities totaled the equivalent of about 
25 billion in may 
another and possibly bigger threat to the nyse is the socalled 
third market of firms that trade stocks off of the exchange 
floor the big board is concerned that its large member firms could 
shift some of their business to offexchange trading 
the third markets share of nyselisted stock trades rose to 74 
percent of overall big board trading through may this year from 31 
percent in the same 1989 period by skirting the nyse floor third 
market firms offer a cheaper and more anonymous way to conduct 
trades 
this electronic alternative to the big board includes 
offexchange firms such as bernard l madoff investment securities 
which can handle trades in 275 of the nyses 1700 listed 
securities the electronic trading system instinet and crossing 
network an afterhours system that matches up trades 
the fully automated national association of securities dealers 
plans to start trading up to 300 overthecounter stocks starting 
at 4 am in september a direct challenge to the london stock 
exchange 
and the american stock exchange said that on monday it would 
outline a joint venture with the chicago board options exchange 
the cincinnati stock exchange and the financial information company 
reuters for trading stocks and options and unregistered securities 
electronically around the world 
how can the 198yearold nyse guarantee its future 
eric k clemons a professor at the university of pennsylvanias 
wharton school said the big board has to make sure institutions 
feel they have no choice that if they want to trade a major us 
stock the only place to trade is new york 
meanwhile nyse competitors and other exchanges welcomed 
phelans proposal to gear up for 24hour trading 
the steps would begin later this year with two brief sessions 
after the markets normal close subsequent phases would involve 
stock auctions held several times a night some form of 
conventional trading overnight and finally 24hour dealing 
andrew yemma a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange 
said the nyse moves would help develop an underlying cash market in 
stocks on a 24hour basis that would add liquidity for futures and 
options trading 
it will increase the awareness and attract greater liquidity 
to offhours trading said linda r coleman executive vice 
president of instinet which is owned by reuters holdings plc 
that can only benefit us because it will atrract more trading to 
our orderflow system 
thirdmarket leader bernad madoff said the increased competition 
faced by the nyse is a healthy byproduct of a changing financial 
world 
their concern is not necessarily the concern of the rest of 
the industry madoff said like any business their loss has 
been someone elses gain

a high court judge on friday backed the 
governments plan to permit retailers to charge cash customers less 
than those who use credit cards 
justice derek hodgson rejected a suit filed by the credit card 
company visa international which sought an order blocking the 
governments proposed action 
visa international said britain would be the first country in 
europe to permit differential pricing 
the real decision is going to be made in the marketplace we 
think that is the most important said a spokeswoman for visa 
international speaking on condition that she not be identified 
however she said the company had not reviewed all the legal 
papers and had not ruled out a further appeal 
the government decided to introduce the twotiered system after 
the monopolies and mergers commission decided last august that visa 
and its member banks were part of a complex monopoly 
an existing no discrimination rule which bans traders who 
accept visa cards from imposing any surcharge on transactions 
operated against the public interest the commission said 
visa has more than 21000 member banks and mortgage lenders 
worldwide 
bernard hughes a spokesman for the retail consortium which 
represents 90 percent of the british retail industry welcomed the 
judges ruling 
we hope it will clarify the situation and that visa will end 
its objections he said

the cat litter that transforms waste into a 
disposable rock seems like a good idea although the neon doggie 
sun visors appear flamboyant enough to make lassie blush 
from functional to extravagant a wide array of pet products is 
on display through saturday at the industrys annual trade show in 
atlanta 
is your pet unhappy because it cannot show the world which nfl 
team is its favorite maybe it would like a dog sweater leash or 
dinner bowl emblazoned with the san francisco 49ers logo or 
perhaps a replica helmet bird feeder 
has your hamster become bored in its oldfashioned cage put 
them into a new multicolored modular model with a looping overhead 
plastic walkway 
are the goldfish uncomfortable in their little bowl try an 
acrylic designer aquariumcoffee table 
among the 485 exhibit booths at the american pet products 
manufacturers association show are myriad makers of pet foods 
animal litter bird cages and other standard pet store fare 
karen long macleod editor of the trade publication pet age 
said the offbeat items arent as frivolous as they may seem 
a major thrust of the industry she said is to provide products 
that make pets more a part of the family rather than just passive 
creatures 
its important to get kids and adults to think about their 
pets and bring them into the family not just look at them as 
disposable things ms macleod said those products are 
designed to keep pets healthy and to have fun 
particularly in the areas of food and litter the industry is 
very research driven she said 
its a pretty healthy industry ms macleod said we see 
it in the number of new companies entering the industry and staying 
in and in shows like these an industry thats stagnant wouldnt 
be doing it 
judging from the number of exhibitors featuring litter keeping 
pets sanitary isnt simple several companies are offering a 
solidifying clay litter that has been developed over the last few 
years 
when a cat wets this litter the clay coagulates into a hardened 
ball that can be scooped out and disposed of the powdery litter 
comes in a jug and the pet owner simply adds more to the box as the 
old portions are discarded 
you dont ever dump it its used up said mike bennett a 
sales representative for sanex corp of houston whose litter is 
called better way 
a few booths away mounds illbased absorbent clay products 
was displaying its version of the solidifying litter which is 
aimed at affluent consumers 
its a superior clumper no doubt about it said ed odom 
absorbents vice president of research 
theres more than one way to keep pets clean bedo cobs a 
maumee ohio maker of corn cob litter was displaying its product 
which the company says is best for bird cages and small animals 
cedar is the most widely used bedding for small animals but 
corn cob is catching on said ted weaver bedo cobs product 
manager unlike other materials corn cob absorbs moisture from the 
bottom up keeping the surface near the animal drier he said

developer donald trump announced he will not 
make payments due today to holders of trump castle casinos junk 
bonds 
trump was due to make principal and interest payments of about 
30 million on the bonds used to finance the atlantic city hotel 
and casino 
he has a 10day grace period to make the payment following 
todays scheduled due date bankers have said 
the brief announcement from trump said negotiations with banks 
are continuing trump has been talking with his bank lenders whom 
he owes about 2 billion and had reached a tentative agreement for 
60 million in new loans earlier this week 
the agreement has been said to be in jeopardy as other bank 
lenders have balked at the arrangement that would have given them 
equity in some of trumps properties in return for the loan and a 
suspension of payments 
the trump organization said an interest payment due today on 
trump plaza bonds had been made and a may 15 interest payment on 
taj mahal was paid 
trump spokeswoman norma foerderer said the company would have no 
further comment beyond the news release 
in reaction to the announcement moodys investors service inc 
lowered its rating on trumps taj mahal bonds and plaza bonds bids 
for trump castle bonds were off about 2 cents trading at 56 cents 
on the dollar and bids for taj mahal bonds were steady around 79 
cents on the dollar john moran a bond trader at advest inc said 
bids had gone lower shortly after the announcement but he doubted 
there were any takers 
bids for bonds on the healthiest of trumps three casinos the 
trump plaza were trading in a narrow range in the low to mid 50s 
moran said 
trumps once gleaming image as a booming developer with a midas 
touch has been tarnished by the slumping new york city real estate 
market and disappointing results from his atlantic city casinos 
as trustee for the castle bonds first fidelity bancorp of 
newark nj oversees the interests of bondholders the bank has 
also loaned trump 75 million paul levine spokesman for first 
fidelity said the bank would have no comment on the announcement 
trumps major bank lenders citicorp bankers trust corp of new 
york chase manhattan bank and the manufacturers hanover bank had 
reached an agreement with the flamboyant developer earlier this 
week however other banks needed to complete the deal were 
reportedly hesitant 
among those were first fidelity and midlantic banks inc of 
edison nj according to a report in this mornings editions of 
the new york times 
some bankers suggested bondholders might scrutinize the role of 
first fidelity as both bond trustee and major lender if he fails to 
make the payment the times reported

in active selling that occurred late in an otherwise lackluster 
session

contract and 588 in the july beans said victor lespinasse an 
assistant vice president in the grain trading division of dean 
witter reynolds inc

the worlds two largest gold 
producing companies announced curtailment of their mining 
operations friday due to the plummeting price of gold 
anglo american corp of south africa ltd said two of its mining 
companies free state state consolidated gold mines ltd freegold 
and vaal reefs exploration and mining co ltd would cut back on 
operations in moves that will cut at least 7800 jobs 
earlier this week two other mining groups outside the 
angloamerican conglomerate announced job cutbacks involving 1100 
workers 
the price of gold reached a 4year low of 34625 per ounce in 
new york and london before recovering on thursday gold is south 
africas major industry earning more than half the countrys 
foreign currency 
lionel hewitt managing director of angloamericans gold and 
uranium division said the company in recent months had tried 
several programs to maintain existing operating levels including 
cost reduction measures and deferment of capital expenditure 
despite these efforts at current gold prices and operating 
costs certain mining areas are now incapable of sustaining mining 
operations at their present levels hewitt said 
he said the curtailment of operations would take place over the 
next nine months and probably result in the loss of 7800 jobs at 
freegold he said reductions at vaal reefs would not necessarily 
eliminate jobs because workers may be assigned to other areas of 
the mine 
operating reductions at freegold would reduce its gold 
production by less than 1 percent while the proposed action at 
vaal reefs likely would improve production hewitt said 
on wednesday general mining union corp announced its 
marginally operating stilfontein gold mining co ltd would lay off 
500 workers immediately to cut costs in the face of low gold 
prices anglovaal ltd said its loraine gold mines ltd would lay 
off 600 workers and reduce production by 10 percent in the next 
four months 
hewitt said anglo american management had invited discussions 
with union leaders about the curtailments there was no immediate 
reaction from the unions 
the national union of mineworkers the nations largest black 
union representing some 250000 black miners has already declared 
a dispute and asked for arbitration in its annual wage negotiations 
with the mining industry body 
curtailing mining operations is considered a serious step once 
a particular shaft is shut down the infrastructure often 
deteriorates rapidly making it even more costly and dangerous to 
resume operations when the price of gold rises

the dollar lost ground in domestic dealings and 
finished mixed in europe in volatile trading friday following the 
release of a flurry of us economic data 
gold prices advanced but were unable to recover from thursdays 
5anounce selloff 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 34950 a troy ounce up 270 from late 
thursday republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for 
gold at 34850 an ounce up 265 an ounce 
the government reported that the nations trade deficit shrunk 
dramatically to 694 billion in april and that consumer inflation 
held to a modest 02 percent gain in may both reports were in line 
with expectations and had little impact on currency dealings 
but a federal reserve report showing a 06 percent rebound in 
mays industrial production took the market by surprise 
this was the first time in several weeks that an economic 
number was reported actually stronger than the market had 
expected said marc chandler an analyst at mms international in 
chicago 
the dollar initially rallied both in europe and the united 
states on the notion that the federal reserve wont be inclined to 
lower interest rates to stimulate production lower interest rates 
make dollardenominated securities less attractive to investors 
but a bout of profittaking swept european markets where the 
dollar closed lower against most currencies and carried through to 
us dealings 
activity was very heavy and very choppy said stephen 
flanagan a vice president at manufacturers hanover trust co 
rumors circulated in the market that west germanys bundesbank 
and the bank of japan are poised to intervene in coming days to 
support their local currencies at the expense of the dollar 
with the idea that the central banks might act to limit 
further dollar gains many wanted to take profits ahead of the 
weekend chandler said 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 15452 yen up 099 yen from 
thursday later in london the dollar was quoted lower at 15410 
yen in new york the dollar closed at 15390 yen down from 15420 
yen on thursday 
in london the pound fell to 17060 from 17080 late thursday 
in new york it cost 17090 to buy one pound more expensive than 
thursdays 17080 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
thursdays rates included 16885 west german marks down from 
16948 14330 swiss francs down from 14355 56806 french 
francs down from 57015 123900 italian lire down from

other late dollar rates in europe compared with late thursdays

56940 19065 dutch guilders up from 19045 124100 italian 
lire down from 124275 and 11698 canadian dollars down from 
11700 
gold prices were mostly higher in london gold traded at a late 
bid price of 34750 per troy ounce up from 34525 late thursday 
in zurich the metal was quoted at 34725 an ounce up from 
34550 in hong kong gold slipped to 34675 an ounce from 
34895

state officials asked a federal judge friday 
to relinquish jurisdiction in a lawsuit filed by allstate insurance 
co that claims new jerseys new automobile insurance law is 
unconstitutional 
douglas eakeley first assistant state attorney general said 
us district judge john w bissell should abstain from considering 
allstates grievances because the same case can be litigated 
properly at the state level 
allstate new jerseys largest insurer says the states new law 
violates the companys rights under the fifth and 14th amendments 
because the law unfairly forces the insurance industry to pay 14 
billion to the state highrisk insurance pool 
part of the fifth amendment says the government cannot take 
private property without just compensation and the 14th amendment 
upholds a right to challenge governmental actions 
bissell reserved decision on the matter 
earlier bissell refused a request by the liberty mutual 
insurance group and continental insurance co of new jersey to move 
cases being handled at the state administrative level to the 
federal level 
liberty also has a separate federal case pending that seeks to 
block the insurance law state farm insurance co is seeking the 
same action in state superior court 
the states 15 insurance servicing carriers including allstate 
liberty state farm and continental are named in a state lawsuit 
claiming they overbilled the staterun joint underwriting 
association the case is being handled by an administrative law 
judge 
the insurance law requires the industry to pay the 14 billion 
during the next seven years to help eliminate a 31 billion debt 
amassed by the jua pool for highrisk drivers the jua which costs 
every new jersey motorist 222 per car on their annual policy is 
to be eliminated under the law 
new jerseys car insurance rates are among the nations highest 
floyd abrams a prominent constitutional lawyer representing 
allstate argued friday that under the federal tax injunction act 
the state should not be allowed to collect surcharges and other 
assessments from the company in the form of a tax 
this is a segregated fund which is applied only for the single 
purpose of paying off the jua debt abrams told bissell we 
think that based on case law that neither the assessment nor 
surcharge is a tax we believe it is paying a private debt 
eakeley responded that the surcharge every motorist pays because 
of the jua losses are hardly a private debt 
gov jim florio who signed the insurance law march 12 has 
maintained that the insurance industry financially benefited from 
the jua and contributed to its financial woes florio said there 
are provisions in the law that ensure auto insurance companies can 
make a fair profit

amoco corp said friday it was pleased by irans 
agreement to pay 600 million for amoco facilities that were seized 
during the islamic revolution but that the effect on earnings 
would be lowered by taxes and an unrelated charge 
the company said it expects to recognize the allcash settlement 
in its secondquarter results provided it receives the money by 
the end of june 
amoco said in a statement from its chicago headquarters that the 
effect of the settlement on net income will be largely offset 
by the asyet undetermined income taxes it must pay on it and by 
an unrelated charge the company will take against the cost of 
future environmental cleanups 
spokesman mike thompson indicated the taxes and cleanup 
provision would total more than 300 million in addition a 
statuatory fee of about 6 million will be deducted by the us 
government the company said 
amoco stock rose 25 cents a share to close at 5212 friday on 
the new york stock exchange 
the settlement was the largest in the history of the 
netherlandsbased iranunited states claims tribunal an 
arbitration body set up in 1980 to mediate financial claims 
we have been discussing things with the iranians and we were 
pleased to reach the settlement thompson said 
the case had been in the tribunal for nine years said thompson 
adding that without fridays agreement it could have dragged on 
for several more years 
two amoco subsidiaries had filed claims against the national 
iranian oil company 
under terms of the agreement amoco iran oil co will receive 
540 million for the 1979 seizure of four persian gulf drilling 
fields and the oil terminal on kharg island irans most important 
oil terminal 
amoco international finance corp was awarded 60 million for 
the expropriation of a petrochemical processing plant in which 
amoco had a halfinterest

the worlds two largest gold 
producing companies announced curtailment of their mining 
operations friday due to the plummeting price of gold 
anglo american corp of south africa ltd said two of its mining 
companies free state state consolidated gold mines ltd freegold 
and vaal reefs exploration and mining co ltd would cut back on 
operations in moves that will cut at least 7800 jobs 
earlier this week two other mining groups outside the 
angloamerican conglomerate announced job cutbacks involving 1100 
workers 
the price of gold reached a 4year low of 34625 per ounce in 
new york and london before recovering on thursday gold is south 
africas major industry earning more than half the countrys 
foreign currency 
lionel hewitt managing director of angloamericans gold and 
uranium division said the company in recent months had tried 
several programs to maintain existing operating levels including 
cost reduction measures and deferment of capital expenditure 
despite these efforts at current gold prices and operating 
costs certain mining areas are now incapable of sustaining mining 
operations at their present levels hewitt said 
he said the curtailment of operations would take place over the 
next nine months and probably result in the loss of 7800 jobs at 
freegold he said reductions at vaal reefs would not necessarily 
eliminate jobs because workers may be assigned to other areas of 
the mine 
operating reductions at freegold would reduce its gold 
production by less than 1 percent while the proposed action at 
vaal reefs likely would improve production hewitt said 
on wednesday general mining union corp announced its 
marginally operating stilfontein gold mining co ltd would lay off 
500 workers immediately to cut costs in the face of low gold 
prices anglovaal ltd said its loraine gold mines ltd would lay 
off 600 workers and reduce production by 10 percent in the next 
four months 
hewitt said anglo american management had invited discussions 
with union leaders about the curtailments there was no immediate 
reaction from the unions 
the national union of mineworkers the nations largest black 
union representing some 250000 black miners has already declared 
a dispute and asked for arbitration in its annual wage negotiations 
with the mining industry body 
curtailing mining operations is considered a serious step once 
a particular shaft is shut down the infrastructure often 
deteriorates rapidly making it even more costly and dangerous to 
resume operations when the price of gold rises

british stock market experts said friday they were 
puzzled by the new york stock exchanges plan to begin afterhours 
trading to an effort to recapture trading of us stocks now 
conducted overseas 
the experts said such trading is relatively small in europe and 
it also is not clear that the business will grow much in coming 
years 
but they also said the proposals were too sketchy to determine 
their implications 
one trader however was enthusiastic saying i see this as a 
major plus for internationalization 
big board chairman john j phelan jr on thursday unveiled a 
fivestep plan to phase in a 24hour market by the end of the 
decade to meet increasing competition from overseas 
the steps would begin with two brief sessions after the new york 
markets normal close at 4 pm eastern time 
later stock auctions would be held several times a night 
followed by some form of conventional trading overnight before 
24hour dealing eventually is introduced 
a spokeswoman for londons stock exchange speaking anonymously 
in keeping with british practice said thursday we ourselves 
have no plans to extend trading hours however the exchange 
continues to respond to traders needs 
the london exchange in march moved up its session half an hour 
to between 830 am and 430 pm in respone to demand for 
earlier trading 
the london exchange went electronic four years ago under the 
sweeping big bang deregulation which placed the execution of 
trades on computer screens by contrast the nyse still executes 
trades through the interaction of stock brokers and specialists on 
the exchange floor 
londons specialists are required to continuously make markets 
in stocks during the exchanges official hours but investors are 
allowed to buy and sell shares anytime via computer 
the big boards move probably is in response to nasdaqs plan to 
begin operating during european hours in the third quarter of this 
year said tim williams who runs trading in us stocks for the 
london investment firm county natwest woodmac 
nasdaq or national association of securities dealers automated 
quotations is an american screenbased overthecounter market 
its a bit difficult to understand really what they the big 
board are going to accomplish by it williams said friday the 
fact of the matter is most of the business here is reasonably 
small whether it can be developed is debatable 
the london exchange said the value of trading in us stocks in 
london came to the equivalent of about 26 billion in may 
representing just 5 percent of the total foreign stock trading of 
503 billion 
about 469 billion worth of british stocks were traded that 
month it said 
europes exchanges currently are focusing their attention on 
creating a single market for trading european stocks which 
represent 65 percent of foreign stock trading on londons exchange 
most trading in us stocks in london is handled by the major 
us brokerage firms which have london operations 
a spokeswoman for one of them morgan stanley amp co said we 
support the stock exchange initiative which responds to the stock 
market environment 
firms that arent members of the new york exchange can trade 
us stocks in europe without following big board regulations 
its really very difficult to know what the implications are 
going to be because theyre very sketchy about what they want to 
do williams said about phelans plan 
investors are unlikely to be willing to wait around for the 
appointed time or agree to an auction he said 
he also said he didnt think investors would be willing to risk 
leaving an overnight order with a broker because a market 
development could occur while the investor is asleep 
he noted that london brokers place overnight orders in tokyo 
but were used to it he said 
im no sure there is going to be global trading he added 
but the enthusiastic london trader who didnt want to be 
identified said we welcome any kind of competition in europe 
the freer or open the market is the better it will be not only for 
traders but also for the investment community 
he said the big board being open during the european morning 
probably would generate more european business because it would 
legitimize trading in us stocks on this side of the atlantic 
many european traders now only consider a new york price on a 
us stock legitimate he said

bond prices tumbled friday on economic reports 
that led traders to conclude the federal reserve did not plan to 
lower shortterm interest rates soon 
in its sharpest oneday drop since midapril the treasurys 
benchmark 30year bond tumbled 1316 point or 813 per 1000 in 
face amount 
its yield which rises when prices fall climbed to 842 percent 
from late wednesdays 834 percent which was the lowest for the 
longterm bond since late january 
economists said they were surprised at the sharp drop which 
came despite news on inflation and the federal trade deficit that 
normally would give bond prices a boost 
they attributed the bulk of the decline to a fed report that 
industrial production rebounded an unexpectedly strong 06 percent 
last month after holding steady in april the market had expected a 
03 percent rise 
some analysts said the market should have dismissed the gain in 
industrial production because it was caused mainly by a buildup in 
inventories by the big three automakers concerned about a possible 
strike 
signs of a strong economy tend to weaken bonds because of 
concerns that inflation will rise and erode the value of such 
longterm fixedincome investments 
the labor department reported retail prices rose a modest 02 
percent in may bringing the rise in the consumer price index for 
the first five months of the year to 58 percent that news should 
have been favorable for credit markets 
in addition the commerce department said the us trade deficit 
shrank to 694 billion in april the second lowest level in the 
last 6 years another positive sign 
ray stone managing director of stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc said the market declined following a financial 
wire report citing unnamed fed officials who reinforced a view they 
werent close to lowering interest rates 
traders believed the economy was not weak enough nor inflation 
calm enough to trigger an easier monetary policy falling interest 
rates boost the value of existing bonds because their rates of 
return are higher and therefore more valuable 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell 316 point to 932 point intermediate maturities 
fell 1332 point to point and longterm issues fell as much as 
1316 point according to telerate inc the financial information 
service 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 478 to 116055 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 793 percent as the 
discount gained 2 basis points to 768 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 802 percent as the discount gained 6 basis points to 
762 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 803 percent as the 
discount rose 6 basis points to 749 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent unchanged from 
late wednesday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 116 point to 91 the average yield to 
maturity rose to 750 percent from 749 percent late thursday

tells workers in one commercial 
the carrier has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
since a crippling strike that began in march 1989 a bankruptcy

became frustrated by the management of easterns owners texas air 
corp 
i dont think honesty is risky shugrue told reporters in 
unveiling the campaign i dont think candor is risky although 
it can be controversial 
the initial commercial showing shugrue fielding questions at an 
eastern hangar here will be followed by an ad showing him talking 
with passengers aboard an eastern flight 
the multimilliondollar campaign is the first for eastern by 
ogilvy amp mather the new york advertising agency that shugrue hired 
in one of his first acts as trustee he declined to give the 
campaigns precise cost 
the campaign is aimed at driving home easterns ontime and 
friendly service and ending confusion among consumers shugrue said

it he said 
the airlines may passenger figures were horrible he said 
but june has shown an upturn 
shugrue said the carrier will recall union pilots based upon 
needs not by seniority as the union has demanded the pilots union 
ended its sympathy strike in support of the machinists last 
november but has discussed returning to the picket lines because of 
the recall issue 
i expect pilots who arent working to return to eastern and 
get going shugrue said everybody has to understand the 
economics of operating this company 
talks are continuing with the machinists union which remains on 
strike he said 
im not pollyannish about it shugrue said of his pledge to 
bring labor peace to eastern theres too much history on this 
property i am optimistic 
eastern employees applauded enthusiastically while watching 
shugrues news conference 
i think he has credibility if anyone can mean longterm 
viability and eastern remaining independent he can said dennis 
cirroti a 24year eastern pilot who returned to work last august 
after striking

martin a siegel who allegedly took suitcases 
filled with cash from ivan boesky in exchange for inside 
information was sentenced friday to two months in prison 
us district judge robert j ward cited siegels contrition and 
cooperation with prosecutors in giving him one of the shortest 
prison terms meted out in wall streets insider trading scandals 
siegel a mergers specialist for the investment firms drexel 
burnham lambert inc and kidder peabody amp co was one of the 
first wall street figures to cooperate with prosecutors after being 
implicated by boesky the notorious stock speculator 
boesky in recent testimony in another case said he gave siegel 
suitcases of cash for inside information on takeover attempts 
siegel has admitted swapping stock tips with former goldman sachs 
amp co trader robert freeman 
over the last three and a half years i have tried to do 
everything in my power to make up for these mistakes siegel said 
in a statement to the court he pleaded guilty in february 1987 to 
conspiracy to violate securities laws and tax evasion 
in addition to the prison time siegel was sentenced to five 
years probation during which he must perform 3000 hours of 
community service no fine was given 
siegel previously agreed to give up more than 9 million in cash 
and assets to settle civil charges brought by the securities and 
exchange commission 
ward chided siegel for his conduct saying in short there is 
no excuse for what he did what we have here weve seen far 
too many times before in the financial community 
siegels cooperation led to the controversial insider trading 
cases against richard b wigton and timothy l tabor two of 
siegels associates at kidder peabody and freeman formerly head 
of arbitrage at goldman sachs 
the arrests in 1987 of the three traders one being led from his 
office in handcuffs stunned the financial community and led to 
widespread predictions that more wall street professionals would be 
implicated in the scandal 
the government alleged freeman made profitable stock deals on 
inside information about takeover attempts supplied by siegel and 
that wigton and tabor made trading decisions using the tips from 
freeman 
the case eventually was dropped when the government said it 
needed more time to gather evidence but last year after more than 
two years of investigations prosecutors announced they would bring 
no charges against wigton and tabor 
freeman agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud and 
admitted he received inside information in january 1986 from siegel 
and used the tip to execute various trades he was sentenced in 
april to four months in prison and a 1 million fine 
assistant us attorney neil cartusciello recommended siegel 
receive a lesser sentence because he cooperated and freeman did not 
while at first saying siegel should be terribly ashamed for 
what he had done the prosecutor went on to praise his thorough 
and open cooperation 
cartusciello said almost all the information supplied by siegel 
was corroborated independently 
the prosecutor said siegels testimony against freeman was 
especially important because the type of scheme they carried out 
was rarely detected by employers or investigators 
the terms of siegels probation require he perform 2400 hours 
of community service at a community college in jacksonville fla 
where he lives and another 600 hours of community service 
unrelated to his financial skills 
siegel was to surrender at a yet unspecified facility sometime 
before july 15 
according to court papers boesky paid siegel 700000 for stock 
tips over four years the payments were in exchange for information 
he gave boesky about corporate takeover battles he waged as an 
investment banker at kidder peabody 
boesky who pleaded guilty to one felony count to settle the 
biggest insider trading case was recently released after 
completing two years of a threeyear prison sentence

of sneakers and casual wear adopted a shareholder rights plan

massachusetts law and create three classes of directors which 
lengthens the time it would take to install an entirely new board 
pentland industries a shoe manufacturer and investment company

pathe communications corp on 
friday extended its 12 billion offer for mgmua communications 
co to june 22 one day before the final deadline to complete its 
complex package for financing the buyout 
it was the second weeklong extension of the tender offer by 
pathe a movie producer and distributor controlled by italian 
financier giancarlo parretti but even previously skeptical 
analysts said it now appears pathe is in the final stages of 
paperwork on the deal 
they appear to be very close to being able to complete the 
transaction said jeffrey logsdon an entertainment industry 
analyst at the crowell weedon amp co stock brokerage 
the 20pershare offer expires june 23 according to parrettis 
agreement with mgmua and tracinda corp the holding company 
through which beverly hills billionaire kirk kerkorian controls 
mgmua 
to help the deal along kerkorian has said he may keep about 20 
million in stock a fraction of the 800 million his 40 million 
shares would bring him if all were sold 
pathe spokesman craig parsons said it hasnt been decided if 
kerkorian will keep the 20 million in stock parsons also said a 
french economic ministers blockage friday of pathes attempt to 
acquire a controlling interest in the pathe cinema theater chain in 
france was unrelated to the mgmua deal 
parretti has made cash down payments of 200 million time 
warner inc has agreed to lend him another 650 million in return 
for a lien on the united artists film library and distribution 
rights on that library and new mgm pathe and united artists films 
for 20 years 
the rest of the financing has been a topic of broad speculation 
but parretti revealed details of the complex package this week 
mainly shortterm loans and asset sales by patheaffiliated 
companies in europe and the possible resale of mgmua stock or 
sale of new pathe shares after the merger 
merely completing the paperwork for the nonus banks involved 
in the lending for the deal is likely to be a logistical nightmare 
logsdon said 
last year a bid by australias qintex group to buy mgmua for 
15 billion collapsed for lack of financing qintex outbid media 
mogul rupert murdoch by 100 million but qintex was unable to come 
up with a 50 million down payment and murdoch refused to get back 
in the bidding 
in structuring the pathe buyout kerkorian has assured himself 
he can pocket the 200 million in cash even if the deal collapses 
parretti also has guaranteed mgmua 75 million in fees from 
distributing three upcoming pathe releases including the russia 
house with sean connery and michelle pfeiffer and quigley down 
under with tom selleck 
jeanne ouellette an mgmua spokeswoman said she wasnt sure 
about kerkorian retaining a stake in the company but said the deal 
was expected to go through even if it comes down to the final 
deadline

abc on thursday adopted nbcs ratings formula 
for calculating the make good free ad time it gives to 
advertisers on shows delivering lower ratings than the network 
promised 
cbs executives issued a statement at the close of the business 
day in which cbs endorsed nbcs statistical formula but said 
nothing about whether cbs too would adopt the formula in its 
makegood policy 
abc urged unity among advertisers and broadcasters 
a uniform stewardship policy is in the best interest of the 
entire advertising and television network communities abc said 
in a statement released by spokeswoman janice gretemeyer 
cbs had been expected to endorse the plan which comes at the 
start of the fall seasons 4 billion upfront ad market which 
brings in nearly half the 9 billion to 10 billion ad revenue 
estimated the fall season 
all three networks blame this seasons overall ratings decline 
on the people meter system used by the ac nielsen co to 
gather viewership figures in 4000 homes nationwide 
abc initially said it would adjust its ratings based on average 
viewing since 1987 when the people meter became the industry 
standard 
nbc which estimated its loses from lower ratings at 100 
million proposed an eightyear nielsen ratings trend as a 
baseline using a statistical technique called regression 
analysis to project tv usage 
nbc would give away makegood time only when tv usage equals or 
exceeds the prediction derived from nielsens historical data 
if the usage that we find is equal to or greater than our 
forecast then we dont dispute the shortfall and we pay off 
said nick schiavone nbcs vice president for sales and marketing 
research 
cbs without elaboration issued the following statement the 
process of regression analysis as outlined by nbc is in principal 
acceptable to us 
it wasnt immediately clear what the network meant david 
poltrack cbs vice president for research was gone for the day 
and could not be reached for comment said spokeswoman betsy wagner 
nielsen which earns 22 million annually from the three 
networks insists its people meter system is not flawed and that 
fewer people are watching network television 
a viewer in a people meter household logs on to the device 
the previous system recorded what was being viewed but not who was 
watching critics of that system cited button fatigue as the 
cause of inaccurate numbers 
abc said the problem of the unexplained volatility and viewing 
losses reported by nielsen still must be addressed by 
broadcasters advertisers and their agencies

percent below a year ago during the four weeks ending april 21 
movement of florida orange juice has averaged less than 3 
million gallons per week for several months and thats just not 
good said ernie thomas a commodity specialist with merrill 
lynch consumer markets in winter haven fla 
he attributed some of the slack demand to the higher prices for 
orange juice following the christmastime freeze that wiped out a 
quarter to a third of the florida crop 
the 198990 florida harvest came in a little larger than the 
government had feared though in a crop report tuesday the 
agriculture department pegged the final tally at 1101 million 
boxes 2 million above the previous months estimate 
brazil meanwhile had a record orange harvest last year of 
roughly 300 million boxes because of the florida shortfall brazil 
now supplies about half of the orange juice sold in the united 
states thomas said 
rumors that brazilian processors have cut their prices were not 
confirmed but contributed to the markets decline

donald trump missed a payment due friday on junk 
bonds used to finance one of his atlantic city resorts the 
harshest signal yet of the troubles plaguing his tottering real 
estate empire 
trump has a 10day grace period to make the payment of an 
estimated 31 million in interest and principal on bonds used to 
finance his trump castle hotelcasino 
but the failure to meet fridays deadline nevertheless brought 
him a step closer to default which theoretically could force a 
bankruptcy filing to defend the flamboyant developer from 
collateralseeking creditors 
what this tells us is he has not been able to reach a deal 
with his banks michael mulvaney a bond analyst with moodys 
investors services inc said of the missed payment he has the 
grace period to work it out if he doesnt work it out then youve 
got the possibility of default 
separately moodys a major wall street credit rating firm on 
friday lowered its ratings for bonds used to finance the trump taj 
mahal and trump plaza hotelcasinos moodys said the missed 
payment for trump castle showed the potential for weakened finances 
at the other two resorts 
a statement issued by the trump organization announcing the 
missed payment said negotiations were continuing with lenders to 
get more money and restructure loans 
trump and his main bankers tentatively had agreed a week ago to 
a bailout that would have provided him another 60 million in loans 
and a temporary suspension of payments in exchange the banks 
would have gotten equity in some of his properties 
if the deal had been finalized he would have had the cash to 
make fridays bond payment 
but other banks involved in the deal reportedly balked at the 
plan first fidelity bancorp of newark nj and midlantic banks 
inc of edison nj reportedly were the main holdouts midlantic 
would not comment on the situation friday 
late friday first fidelity announced it would resign as trustee 
for the bondholders once a successor is found the bank said it 
wanted to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in its 
role as both a bank lender and overseer of bondholders interest as 
trustee 
spokesmen for his four major bank lenders citicorp chase 
manhattan bankers trust and manufacturers hanover either would 
not comment or did not return telephone calls 
trump has been beset by a slumping real estate market in new 
york and disappointing results from his three atlantic city 
casinos and the trump shuttle airline 
his real estate holdings which also include new yorks plaza 
hotel and trump tower were built largely with funds borrowed with 
junk bonds and bank loans trump owes banks an estimated 2 billion 
and bondholders another 1 billion 
the ongoing negotiations have raised speculation that bankers 
want more authority over operation of his properties possibly even 
naming new managers and leaving trump only as a figurehead 
the negotiations also have caught the eye of the new jersey 
casino control commission 
its always a matter of concern when any casino is in 
difficulty said tom flynn a commission spokesman also the new 
jersey division of gaming enforcement has been auditing trumps 
properties for more than a month the dge an arm of the state 
attorney generals office has characterized the audit as routine 
fridays payment was due on two bonds issued to finance the 
trump castle one paying 1375 percent due in 1997 and one paying 7 
percent due in 1999 
trump who bought back many of his bonds at a discount on the 
open market owes about 12 million in interest and 10 million in 
principal on the 1375 percent bonds and about 9 million on the 7 
percent bonds according to sheila oconnell a bond analyst with 
duff amp phelps a chicago investment firm 
the total amount trump would owe if he had not bought back any 
bonds is 426 million 
in the first three months of 1990 trump castle lost 84 
million the largest loss among the 12 casinos in atlantic city 
trump castle recorded improved gross gaming revenues for the 
first three months of the year but failed to maintain those gains 
after the taj mahal opened april 2 
trump castles win in may fell 173 percent from a year 
earlier to 179 million 
the win is the amount of money a casino wins at gaming 
tables and slot machines and does not account for operating 
expenses depreciation debt service taxes and other charges 
for may the taj mahal broke its own citywide record for win 
with 365 million or 118 million a day trump plaza helped by 
a 10 million windfall from an unlucky japanese high roller at the 
baccarat table posted a win of 313 million up 23 percent from 
may 1989
