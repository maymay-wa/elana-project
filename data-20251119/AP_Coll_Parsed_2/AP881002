the colorado democratic party on sunday disavowed 
a congressional candidate who it said failed to respond to 
allegations in a lawsuit that he distributed posters connecting an 
airline with aids 
the executive committee of the state party voted 331 to deny 
john j mitchell the use of the name democrat in his house campaign 
the party needed to deal with this openly dont flinch dont 
blush just do business and i think thats what weve done here 
said state democratic chairman buie seawell 
trans world airlines has accused mitchell of distributing 
anonymous posters with such messages as aids is spread through 
twa and twa travel with aids 
according to twas lawsuit which seeks 500000 in damages 
mitchell sent a poster to the airlines new york offices in july 
saying thousands of these have been sent around the country our 
staff is working on a new poster they will continue to be sent 
until twa corrects the hurt you have causedcost me 
mitchells squabble with twa apparently began in 1983 when he 
took the airline to small claims court in two separate cases to 
recover frequent flyer benefits he felt he deserved mitchell 
won one case and lost another 
mitchell did not attend sundays meeting state party leaders 
said he has not made himself available to talk with them about the 
matter since the lawsuit was filed sept 19 in us district court 
at denver 
the 53yearold teacher and realtor from colorado springs 
reportedly has denied the charges made by twa he did not respond 
to messages including one sunday night left by the associated 
press on his home phone answering machine 
in his first foray into politics mitchell was unopposed for the 
democratic nomination to run against republican rep joel hefley in 
the heavily republican 5th congressional district which 
encompasses colorado springs 
the district democratic committee met first sunday and issued a 
complaint saying mitchells failure to respond to the controversy 
surrounding the lawsuit has hurt the campaigns of other democratic 
candidates in the district 
i can verify that it is hurting my candidacy people ask me 
what craziness are you going to come up with said ray james 
who is running against an incumbent republican for a legislative 
seat in the district 
the partys vote sunday wont affect the ballot which already 
has been printed but the party said it would publish the disavowal 
in newspapers 
rick daily the partys attorney stressed that the party wasnt 
making a judgment on twas allegations against mitchell but was 
moving against him only because of mr mitchells failure to act 
like a responsible candidate and step forward and deal with those 
issues 
seawell called mitchell a walkon candidate and said he was 
nominated with the best of intentions 
he was a realtor an educator and seemed like a nice guy 
the party chairman said 
mitchell teaches communications at pikes peak community college

next time herbert connolly probably wont 
wait till the last minute to vote the democratic candidate for the 
massachusetts governors council arrived too late at the polls and 
lost the election by one vote 
a recount last week showed that connolly lost the democratic 
nomination in the sept 15 election the recount showed connolly 
with 14715 votes his opponent got 14716 
the 67yearold car dealer said he had been campaigning on 
election day and i waited until the last minute to race over 
to vote 
the result gives new meaning to the phrase oneman 
onevote said connollys attorney william galvin 
connolly a member of the council since 1969 is protesting the 
election claiming that some ballots are missing and others are 
invalid 
the eightmember governors council which dates from the 
colonial era lost many of its powers in the 1960s its chief 
remaining duties are to approve criminal pardons and confirm judges 
nominated by the governor 
galvin said he would go to court today to request that the 
primary be invalidated and a special election be held to decide the 
nomination 
the lawyer also suggested the close vote might have had 
something to do with the last name of connollys opponent robert 
b kennedy 
also on the ballot were sen edward m kennedy and rep joseph 
kennedy both dmass 
although lowell city councilor robert b kennedy is not a member 
of the famous massachusetts political clan galvin said he may 
have benefited from uncertainty on that point 
robert kennedy opposes another election 
all another election would do at this point would be to give 
my opponent an opportunity to vote he said

retired after a 50year career that started under josef stalin 
gorbachev has proposed expanding the powers of the largely 
ceremonial presidency along with slashing the massive party 
apparatus 
in japan foreign ministry officials said they hoped the shakeup 
will produce a new soviet policy toward japan the kyodo news

antagonism because of competing claims on a group of islands in the 
kurile chain that soviet troops have occupied since the closing 
days of the war 
there was no immediate response from chinese officials 
east european leaders were quick to shower gorbachev with 
congratulatory telegrams saturday notes were sent from hungarian 
communist leader karoly grosz and president bruno f straub 
czechoslovak president gustav husak polish leader wojciech 
jaruzelski and romanian leader nicolae ceausescu who is scheduled 
to meet with gorbachev next week in moscow 
this is a meaningful expression of the soviet nations esteem 
for your services as a precursor creator and unremitting executor 
of the policy of perestroika openness democratization and new 
thinking jaruzelskis message said polands official pap news 
agency reported 
italian premier ciriaco de mita congratulated gorbachev and said 
he will be able to give a renewed and accentuated push to the 
work of stabilization and reinforcement of international relations 
which you have already undertaken with such effectiveness 
indian president r venkataraman of india said gorbachevs 
outstanding personal contribution to the world peace and 
disarmament created a new climate in international relations 
austrian newspapers saturday said the changes signal a 
strengthening of the gorbachev camp 
successful and surprising coup of the kremlin chief 
gorbachev removes all opponents of his reform policy was the 
headline in the independent kurier austrias second largest daily 
in vienna 
us secretary of state george p shultz said on friday the 
shakeup was difficult to assess immediately 
but he added mr gorbachev is a very strong and determined 
person he has a major reform program that he is working on and if 
there is any message from this it is that he intends to pursue that 
program

consumer prices rose 1179 percent during 
september a respected economics analysis firm said saturday it is 
by far the largest monthly inflation increase in peruvian history 
the dramatic rise pushed inflation from january through 
september to 754 percent according to the report by apoyo 
the national statistics institute said its inflation figures 
which were due for release friday had been delayed until early 
this week 
apoyos figures which have in the past reflected the 
governments official report showed the categories of books 
transportation and food had the highest price gains during 
september registering 180 percent 177 percent and 120 percent 
respectively 
according to government figures the highest single month price 
rise since figures were kept in 1922 previously occurred in july 
registering 309 percent the previous highest yearly mark was 
1583 percent set in 1985 
the sharp cost of living increase was anticipated after the 
government early in september devalued currency 86 percent and 
allowed prices for food gasoline and other goods to rise as high 
as 200 percent in an effort to control runaway inflation which is 
still expected to reach 900 percent this year 
the government said the austerity plan aimed at eliminating 
costly government subsidies will begin to show results this month 
and cut inflation to near zero by early next year 
independent analysts said the chief causes of perus record 
inflation are a government deficit estimated at more than 12 
percent of the gross national product dwindling production coupled 
with hot consumer demand and a widening trade imbalance

by 105 percent rents by 36 percent and rail transport by 367 
percent for passengers and 467 for cargo

sen dan quayle said the united states should 
make completion of a treaty on longrange nuclear weapons 
conditional on soviet concessions on conventional arms a position 
that differs from that of vice president george bush the new york 
times reported 
in an interview reported in the newspapers sunday editions 
quayle said he was worried the soviets would not negotiate 
seriously on cutting conventional weapons if the two superpowers 
reach a prior agreement in their strategic arms reduction talks 
if we negotiate on start what leverage do we have on 
conventional quayle told the times 
the reagan administration has rejected the idea of linking talks 
on strategic nuclear arms with talks on conventional arms saying 
it would delay completion of a strategic arms treaty the bush 
campaign has endorsed that position 
quayle said in the interview he would follow administration 
policy if he became vice president 
the view of the bush campaign is that we are going to proceed 
with start and we want to talk about conventional arms control 
quayle said but there has not been the linkage that i 
discussed 
if bush is elected president quayle said top officials will 
sit down and discuss what the strategy is going to be on nuclear 
and conventional arms issues 
and the strategy as far as the connecting of these youve 
got to wait until you get into the administration for some of those 
very important subtle issues 
quayle a member of the senate armed services committee had not 
previously revealed these positions in the campaign the times said 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and running 
mate sen lloyd bentsen have said they would try to complete a 
strategic nuclear arms treaty as soon as possible without injecting 
new demands in the talks

pressure was 168 over 76 matching the highest reported level since 
his condition worsened sunday morning it had been 135 over 70 the 
imperial agency said 
the imperial household agency said the emperors normal pressure 
was not immediately available but a typical normal reading is 
about 120 over 80 high blood pressure can pose a strain on the 
heart and worsen internal bleeding 
maeda said it was unclear how much blood the emperor lost 
saturday but news reports said it could have been as much as 21 
pints hirohitos vital signs stabilized later saturday after he 
was given two emergency transfusions totaling 17 pints 
doctors have expressed concern that the volume of transfusions 
needed to compensate for hirohitos internal bleeding may have side 
effects they said he is losing strength because intraveneous 
feeding alone cannot supply enough nutrients and he reportedly 
also is suffering from jaundice 
other than five or six spoonfuls of porridge saturday morning 
and two small fragments of ice more than a week ago the emperor 
has been unable to eat or drink since the onset of the crisis 
news reports have said hirohito is suffering from cancer of the 
upper intestine but imperial officials have not confirmed or 
denied the reports

bavarian governor franzjosef 
strauss the countrys leading ultraconservative was fighting for 
his life sunday after collapsing the day before from a heart 
attack officials said 
his situation is serious according to a state government 
statement released to the news media early sunday he is not out 
of lifethreatening danger 
strauss 73 is head of the christian social union the bavarian 
sister party of the nationally dominant christian democrats 
he was hospitalized in the bavarian city of regensburg after 
suffering a possible stomach rupture in addition to a heart attack 
that at first was suspected to be slight the state governors 
office said 
state spokesman helmut schwaabe said strauss was stricken 
saturday afternoon while on a hunting trip in the regensburg area 
of bavaria about 65 miles northeast of munich 
schwaabe told the associated press in a telephone interview from 
his office in munich that strauss was conscious and his condition 
had stabilized by late saturday evening doctors were planning to 
operate to correct strauss condition schwaabe said 
however the statement issued early sunday superseded the 
earlier statements indicating strauss had taken a turn for the 
worse 
the outspoken strauss often has been at the center of national 
policymaking and has used international travels to wield influence 
over foreign policy as well 
his thick bavarian accent coupled with stinging comments also 
makes the outspoken corpulent state governor west germanys most 
colorful politician 
from 1966 to 1969 strauss served as finance minister under 
thenchancellor kurt georg kiesinger in the socalled great 
coalition of west germanys conservative parties with the 
leftleaning social democrats 
after the social democrats took over the government in coalition 
with the centrist businessoriented free democratic party in 1969 
strauss remained as a member of the federal parliaments 
conservative opposition until 1978 when he was elected governor of 
bavaria 
two years later he was nominated to run for chancellor but lost 
the election against social democrat helmut schmidt in 1980 he 
kept his post as bavarian state governor

coffeeproducing and consuming nations belonging 
to the international coffee organization agreed sunday on new 
producers export quotas aimed at stabilizing prices and improving 
availability of choice grades 
the final negotiations were difficult but the result was a 
good one said jorio dauster head of brazils negotiating team 
it was a positive outcome said chief american delegate jon 
rosenbaum 
delegates said the new deal is very complicated but is primarily 
designed to keep the average price of coffee currently 114 a 
pound above 115 dollars and below 145 in the 198889 
marketing year which began saturday 
it calls for a global export quota the organizations means of 
pricecontrol of 56 million bags for 198889 one bag equals 132 
pounds 
the group also agreed to ensure that consuming nations can 
obtain the sort of coffee they want mainly the popular latin 
american arabica grade 
under the old agreement all cuts or increases in the global 
export quota were applied equally to all types of coffee the new 
agreement favors the arabicas 
such a system would likely reduce market share for african 
robusta producers delegates said 
the basis for the 74member groups final agreement was hammered 
out late saturday at a meeting between top negotiators from brazil 
colombia the united states and west germany the worlds biggest 
producers and consumers delegates said 
the talks had been bogged down over the system for adjusting 
quotas in relation to the movement in world prices

democrats who hope sen lloyd bentsen will 
help the ticket win his home state of texas and perhaps the 
presidential election could do well to regard the fate of henry 
gassaway davis 
in case anyone doesnt remember davis was democrat alton b 
parkers running mate when parker ran for president against 
republican teddy roosevelt in 1904 
the voters chose between roosevelt and parker and their choice 
was roosevelt by a 32 margin 
experts concede that the vice presidential debate in omaha 
neb on wednesday between bentsen and republican dan quayle may 
make a difference but they say the voters final decision will 
come down to a choice between the top of the tickets democrat 
michael dukakis and vice president george bush 
unless quayle is absolutely destroyed in the debate with 
bentsen i dont think it will hurt bush said leo ribuffo a 
specialist in political history at george washington university in 
washington 
people will be looking for quayle to blow it said samuel h 
kernell professor of political science at the university of 
california at san diego if he can get through the debate in a 
competent fashion where he looks unexceptional it will be a real 
success for him 
eddie mahe jr a republican political consultant said i 
think it is reasonable to suggest that george bush would have won 
indiana quayles home state without mr quayle and with mr 
bentsen mike dukakis is still not going to carry texas so you 
wash that out 
i think the odds are that quayle will have little or no effect 
on the ultimate choice said thomas mann program director for 
governmental studies at the brookings institution here 
elspeth rostow a political scholar at the lyndon b johnson 
school of public affairs at the university of texas in austin said 
bushs choice of quayle doesnt seem to have too much effect on 
the voters at least so far 
i dont think if indeed bush was disposed to choose quayle to 
appeal to women that so far it has had that effect ms rostow 
said 
i think the conventional wisdom that the selection of a 
running mate is rarely decisive one way or another is absolutely 
true said ribuffo 
a survey conducted this year by the hearst corp supports this 
view 
eighteen percent of the 1001 voters surveyed said they had 
changed their minds about a presidential candidate at one time or 
another because of their opinion of his running mate of those 70 
percent said they voted against that ticket 
political experts agree that if a running mate has any effect 
he is more likely to hurt than help 
examples cited include president fords selection of sen robert 
dole of kansas who was criticized for his slashing debating style 
in 1976 and walter mondales choice of geraldine ferraro who 
suffered from examination of her familys finances in 1984 
clearly in my opinion bob dole in 1976 in that debate with 
mondale jimmy carters running mate cost jerry ford votes mahe 
said clearly in 1984 in my opinion geraldine ferraro cost 
walter mondale votes probably 
in richard nixons unsuccessful campaign of 1960 some thought 
that republican vice presidential candidate henry cabot lodge hurt 
the tickets chances by pledging that nixon would appoint a black 
to the cabinet a statement nixon disavowed 
lodge a former ambassador to the united nations also was 
criticized for taking naps and not campaigning hard enough some 
have thought that if he had used his prestige from the un more 
effectively nixon might have edged out kennedy ms rostow said 
there are exceptions to the rule that running mates dont help 
much the experts said 
while there is disagreement over whether lodge hurt nixon in 
1960 almost everybody agrees that lyndon b johnson helped kennedy 
by enabling him to carry texas 
i dont think kennedy would have won without johnson 
ribuffo said 
also ribuffo said mondale may have helped carter win election 
in 1976 by imparting legitimacy to the former georgia governor in 
the eyes of skeptical liberals 
then there was the running mate that republicans chose in 1900 
to help the colorless william mckinley win a second term against 
the dynamic democrat william jennings bryan the ticket of 
mckinley and roosevelt became known as the kangaroo ticket 
because it had a kick in the tail ms rostow said 
there havent been many tickets in any other year including 
1988 with that much of a kick in the tail the experts agree

the challenger tragedy 
highlighted the danger of space shuttle launches but astronauts 
also face risks when their orbiter rips through earths atmosphere 
and plunges toward landing like a streamlined brick experts 
say 
the landing is not as dramatic and exciting as the launch and 
doesnt involve extremely powerful rockets but theres no question 
landing is a very critical operation and requires a great deal of 
attention said b john garrick president of a newport beach 
engineering consulting firm 
discovery is to conclude its fourday mission with a landing 
here monday morning at 933 am pdt it will swoop across 
californias coast at 437 times the speed of sound slow to 
subsonic speeds then drop at a steep angle before leveling out 
without any power and glide toward touchdown on the unpaved surface 
of rogers dry lake 
it comes down like a streamlined brick said milt thompson 
chief engineer for nasas dryden flight research facility at this 
mojave desert military base where 18 of 24 previous shuttle 
missions landed five flights landed at cape canaveral fla and 
one at white sands missile range nm 
thompson said that while shuttle landings are less dangerous 
than launches there is still an element of risk on whether or 
not you make this landing properly because a lot of it does rely on 
the pilots judgment and you are approaching the ground at an 
extremely high rate of descent 
the jan 28 1986 explosion that destroyed challenger and 
killed seven crew members 73 seconds after liftoff from florida 
prompted redesign of faulty shuttle booster rockets and many other 
changes including installation of an emergency escape system so 
astronauts can bail out while approaching the landing site 
the braking and steering systems also were modified in hope of 
avoiding the brake and tire damage that had occurred during earlier 
landings 
the national aeronautics and space administration said the 
changes were meant to eliminate mechanical and heatcaused brake 
damage improve steering to provide better control in crosswinds or 
if tires blow out and prevent bending of main landing gear axles 
caused by brake overheating 
at the urging of astronauts and the rogers commission which 
investigated the challenger disaster shuttles will land here for 
the foreseeable future frustrating nasas initial plans to save 
time and money by landing the spacecraft regularly back at the cape 
canaveral launch site 
the 44squaremile dry lakebed at edwards leaves plenty of room 
for safety if brakes fail or tires blow while a similar mishap at 
the cape could put the shuttle in the water 
one of the first dangers associated with landing is the 
possibility that the shuttle could burn up in the atmosphere after 
the pilot turns the shuttle upsidedown and backwards fires small 
rockets in what is called the deorbit burn an hour before 
landing then flips the shuttle forward again for reentry 
onboard computers help keep the shuttle at the proper angle for 
reentry and nasa also modified discoverys thermal tiles and 
blankets to improve its ability to withstand heat 
im always a little concerned until he gets into the 
atmosphere said bob evans chief of the air force research 
projects office at edwards 
years before shuttles flew nasa officials built mercury gemini 
and apollo capsules that parachuted to ocean splashdowns they 
doubted a spacecraft could be built to land on earth like an 
unpowered airplane 
but they wanted a reusable space shuttle planelike shuttle 
landings were made possible by years of experimental flights with 
xseries aircraft wingless lifting bodies and the enterprise 
shuttle prototype and by the advent of sophisticated computer 
guidance systems and heatshield tiles that dont burn during a 
return to the atmosphere 
if we didnt have good computers we wouldnt be able to do 
reentry said david richardson an air force aerospace engineer 
thompson said another big hurdle for a shuttle pilot is energy 
management which means making sturns and other maneuvers to 
reduce the shuttles speed as it approaches the landing site 
if he doesnt control his energy accurately enough he may 
overshoot edwards and not have a place to land or undershoot and 
land in the water thompson said 
because the shuttle glides to earth without power theres no 
opportunity to go around evans said youve got to hit it the 
first time 
there are a lot of systems where if they fail youd have a 
problem thompson said if the landing gear didnt deploy 
youd have a belly landing which could be catastrophic 
another possible failure involves the shuttles three auxiliary 
power units or apus which power the hydraulic system that runs 
the spacecrafts control flaps rudders and speed brakes 
in a study commissioned by nasa and mcdonnell douglas corp and 
publicized last summer garricks engineering consulting firm of 
pickard lowe and garrick estimated there is a onein70 chance 
that all three apus will fail during a landing attempt and cause 
the shuttle to crash 
that estimate contains so much uncertainy that the actual risk 
could be as high as one in 30 or as low as one in several hundred 
garrick said friday nasa contends the risk is even lower 
on sunday the discovery astronauts briefly switched on the apus 
and reported they were working fine

just when it appeared congress might finish a 
year without amending the tax laws the senate is preparing to 
consider a bill that would make hundreds of changes and create some 
protections for taxpayers involved in disputes with the internal 
revenue service 
unlike most of the other tax bills of the 1980s there is little 
in this legislation to draw the concern of the average family most 
of the changes are intended to clear up ambiguities or correct 
errors in the 1986 tax overhaul 
but there are tidbits for some farmers oil drillers freelance 
writers firsttime homebuyers banks and workers who receive 
educational assistance from their employers 
all told the bill would parcel out tax benefits worth 23 
billion over three years most of the money to pay for those 
benefits would come from a higher tax bite on some corporations 
the house has passed a much larger bill costing about 7 
billion if the senate passes its bill negotiators would attempt 
to work out a compromise between the two versions before congress 
adjourns for the year likely by oct 15 
also awaiting action before adjournment are two issues with 
major political importance in this election year 
one is the melding of separate antidrug bills passed by the 
house and senate the second is final action on a senate package of 
parental leave and antichildpornography legislation that could 
end up with a provision expanding benefits for child care 
more than 100 amendments to the tax bill are awaiting 
consideration one of the most contentious written by sens gordon 
humphrey rnh and william armstrong rcolo would deny a tax 
exemption to any clinic that regularly performs abortion 
although opponents say they have the votes to defeat that 
amendment humphrey and armstrong could tie up the senate for a 
considerable amount of time before the proposal ever reaches a vote 
one of the few points of controversy already in the bill is 
drawing fire from tobaccostate lawmakers it would require the 
treasury department to study what effect the tax on cigarettes has 
on reducing smokingrelated health problems 
there is wide senate support for the taxpayer bill of rights 
included in the legislation the chief sponsor of the bill of 
rights sen david pryor dark says it is necessary to rein in 
some irs employees who he contends have trampled on taxpayer 
rights 
the reagan administration has opposed the bill of rights saying 
some of its provisions would duplicate improvements already made by 
the irs while others would hamper the agencys ability to collect 
taxes 
included in pryors plan are requirements that the irs fully 
inform taxpayers of their rights any time a tax dispute arises and 
waive any penalty that is attributed to relying on written advice 
furnished by the irs 
it would prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the 
basis of how much tax they collect and extend to 30 days the 10day 
waiting period before assets may be seized to satisfy overdue taxes 
the tax bill has been more than two years in development the 
administration and tax professionals have been urging passage to 
clear up uncertainties left after the tax code was overhauled in 
1986 
the push for passage picked up support this year when house and 
senate tax committees added amendments exempting farmers and 
certain other business people from paying the federal diesel tax on 
fuel for offroad use under a 1987 law they are required to pay 
the tax and file later for a refund 
other popular provisions in the bill would extend tax breaks for 
firsttime homebuyers corporate research businesses that hire 
disadvantaged workers and workers whose employers provide them 
with educational or legal assistance 
in the last quartercentury congress has passed and 
presidents have signed major tax bills on the average of one a 
year since president reagan took office less than eight years ago 
taxes were cut in 1981 raised in 1982 1983 1984 1985 and 1987 
and thoroughly overhauled in 1986

george bush frequently calls michael dukakis 
the stealth candidate who makes his positions invisible on 
political radar but bush himself is doggedly vague on some issues 
when it finds it convenient 
where does the vice president stand for instance on raising 
the minimum wage or on parental job leaves 
as he has reached out to lowincome voters in recent weeks bush 
said he favors boosting the federal minimum wage which has stood 
at 335 an hour for eight years 
on parental leaves he said women should not have to worry about 
getting their jobs back after having a baby or caring for a 
severely ill child 
in neither case however has bush filled in the blanks with 
specifics neither issue is very popular with conservatives and his 
statements leave him at odds with the white house so perhaps the 
less bush says the better 
craig fuller who is bushs chief of staff said both are the 
kind of issue one ought not to be silent on during a political 
campaign on the other hand he said bush does not have to be 
specific 
after a republicanled filibuster the senate dropped a bill 
that would have raised the hourly minimum wage to 455 over three 
years as president of the senate bush made no effort to bring the 
filibuster to a halt 
the vice president has never said how much of an increase in the 
minimum wage he supported he has not and will not attach any 
numbers to that fuller said 
with the minimum wage bill dead the senate is turning to a 
measure that would require employers to give unpaid leave to 
workers after childbirth or while caring for a sick child 
again bush has not outlined his policy other than a general 
statement of support for the concept 
he made a passing reference to it fuller said we have 
not laid out any particular formula 
is bushs staff working on a formula not at this point no 
fuller replied 
there have been other times when bush has raised an issue but 
not explained what he meant 
in his first nationally televised debate with dukakis last week 
bush was asked what he would do for the 37 million americans who 
cannot afford health insurance many because they earn too much to 
qualify for medicaid coverage for the needy 
what i will do he said is permit people to buy into 
medicaid i believe thats the answer 
the next day a reporter asked bushs campaign chairman james 
a baker iii to explain what bush was talking about 
well all i know on that is that he thinks that would be an 
appropriate approach to explore baker said 
asked to elaborate on how the poor would buy into medicaid 
baker replied it means taking a look at the medicaid laws and 
medicaid system seeing if theres a way that these 22 to 37 
million people have some way at minimal cost to finance health 
coverage for themselves 
baker also pulled bush back from his statement in the debate 
suggesting that he would favor criminal penalties for women who 
have abortions if the procedure is declared illegal 
i havent sorted out the penalties bush had said 
theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law 
dukakis immediately criticized that statement the next morning 
baker conferred with bush and told reporters that it is his view 
that he would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal not 
withstanding his view in favor of right to life

a usvietnamese team embarked on a new 
expedition sunday after a grueling trek through leechinfested 
mountains to retrieve the wreckage of american warplanes and 
interview villagers about the fate of crew members 
during a search last week of vinh phu and bac thai provinces 
northwest of hanoi the team found villagers who recalled in detail 
what happened to airmen who bombed them during the vietnam war more 
than 15 years ago 
no human remains were recovered but the villagers accounts may 
help resolve the cases said us team members who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the war is over one american 
investigator quoted villagers as saying you caused a lot of 
death and destruction but if you need help we will help you 
two teams are conducting the first joint usvietnamese field 
investigation to try to account for 1757 americans listed as 
missing in action or mia in the country us forces withdrew 
from vietnam in 1973 fighting ended when the communists defeated 
usbacked south vietnam in 1975 
the cooperative effort is seen as a major breakthrough in an 
issue marked by frequent bickering deep distrust and hanois 
reluctance to allow us experts to work in the countryside 
the team that searched crash sites in vinh phu and bac thai for 
six days drove off in jeeps sunday to investigate an area in ha nam 
ninh province south of hanoi the second team continued work in 
lang son and ha bac provinces just northeast of the capital the 
10day search ends wednesday 
the teams each are comprised of three specialists from the us 
joint casualty resolution center and the army central 
identification laboratory and four experts from vietnams office 
for seeking missing personnel 
they focused on a halfdozen of the 70 discrepancy cases 
that the united states has asked vietnam to resolve urgently us 
officials say vietnamese authorities at some level should have 
information about the 70 missing men some are known to have been 
captured but never were heard from again 
many areas of mountainous vinh phu and bac thai were not 
reachable by jeeps or by the motorcycles 
the americans said they walked climbed and crawled about 30 
miles investigating two cases in the area they showed the marks 
left on their skin by the briar patches that sliced their arms and 
legs and by the numerous leeches that sucked blood from their feet 
each carried a backpack weighing up to 40 pounds containing 
metal detectors satellite navigational devices and food 
we went to some places where we were up to 2000 feet and all 
you could see below was jagged rock and the ledge we stood on was 
only a foot wide one american said it was breathtaking 
they slept wherever they could one night in a wooden hut that 
appeared to have been a guard post during the french colonial 
period they said 
food was canned army rations and meals served by local 
officials including roasted dog meat snails small wild birds 
and as one american put it chickens with their heads still on 
the snails were great one american said the first snail 
i ate for my country and the rest for enjoyment 
the search focused on the thai nguyen area of bac thai a 
railway junction and steel mill center that was targeted by us 
bombers during the war 
the americans retrieved pieces of wreckage which they will bring 
back to the united states for analysis they photographed other 
evidence including certificates people hung in their houses in 
which the government commended them for shooting down us aircraft 
no human remains were recovered but vietnamese officials said 
that in some of the halfdozen cases villagers claimed they knew 
where remains were

the navy and air force each puzzled by an 
unexpected increase in accidents this summer involving 
highperforming jets have failed to find a common thread to 
explain the mishaps officials say 
from a historical standpoint the current accident rates for 
navy and air force fighter and attack jets are not out of line 
officials say indeed the navy is actually enjoying one of its 
alltime safest years for aviation 
both services have mounted careful monitoring campaigns because 
of accident spurts involving the navys f14s and the air forces 
f16s 
the air force says it has found no equipment problems but has 
changed some of its pilot training techniques and increased 
supervision because of the rise in mishaps 
officials say several of this years f16 accidents involved 
pilots who lost consciousness as a result of fast aerial maneuvers 
or who became disoriented and lost track of where they were 
the navy hasnt detected any equipment problems either but has 
made no change in pilot training 
were just not seeing any common threads at all to justify 
changes says lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman at the 
pentagon 
the navys accident spurt involves the services topoftheline 
fighter the f14 tomcat the service went through the first eight 
months of 1988 with only one socalled class a accident involving 
the f14 the plane was lost but the twoman crew survived in that 
accident 
a class a mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or 
damage exceeding 500000 to an aircraft 
but in the single month of september the navy lost five tomcats 
two on one day and saw three of its aviators die two of the 
planes were lost on separate days from the same aircraft carrier 
the uss carl vinson while on patrol duty in the northern arabian 
sea 
during 1987 the navy lost eight f14s in accidents that 
produced two fatalities 
the mishap rates this year for the navys fa18 hornet and a6 
intruder meantime have dropped significantly below last years 
levels indeed after the worst year ever for the fa18 in 1987 
when 10 class a accidents were reported only three such mishaps 
have occurred so far this year 
on the air force side the accident spurt involves the f16 
fighting falcon serious mishaps with that singleengine fighter 
have ballooned from 12 in fiscal 1987 to 23 in fiscal 1988 the 
year that ended on friday 
seven f16 pilots died in fiscal 1988 compared to five in 
fiscal 1987 and for the first time ever fiscal 1988 saw the air 
force lose three of the planes on one day june 29 in two 
accidents 
the service acknowledges this years increase in f16 accidents 
has raised concerns about pilot training and whether the plane is 
too hot for some pilots to control 
we attribute almost 70 percent of these f16 losses to human 
error and have taken steps to correct that trend by focusing on 
causes of mishaps and placing emphasis on training and 
supervision says maj donna pastor an air force spokeswoman 
we believe the f16 is a very safe aircraft and the lifetime 
statistics for the plane bear that out added col larry w 
foley the chief of safety and nuclear surety in the air force 
inspector generals office 
but its also a pretty sophisticated aircraft that can do a 
lot of things that aircraft in the past couldnt do foley added 
the safety official said several of this years accidents 
with the f16 had involved pilots who lost consciousness as a 
result of unusually rapid aerial maneuvers 
they said several more involved pilots who suffered 
spatial disorientation losing track of where they were in the 
air 
to counter those problems foley said the air force has stepped 
up pilot training in breathing and other techniques to handle heavy 
gravity forces started a special education program on the type of 
physical fitness workouts needed to counter gravity forces begun 
using huge centrifuge machines more frequently to condition young 
pilots and added extra training in instrument flying so that 
pilots can maintain control of a plane even when they are 
physically disoriented 
by contrast the topoftheline air force fighter the f15 
eagle enjoyed a banner year for safety only one eagle crashed in 
fiscal 1988 and the pilot survived three of the planes and two 
pilots were lost in fiscal 1987 
the air force says the f15 normally posts a better safety 
record than the f16 in part because the eagle has two engines and 
the falcon only one and in part because the falcon must train for 
airtoground attacks as well as airtoair fight

a little wooden bridge is saving motorists 
and buggies a lot of trouble in this northwestern pennsylvania town 
when the state proposed a 45mile detour rather than put up a 
temporary structure while it replaced a small 60yearold bridge 
spanning a creek a group of sparta township residents got together 
and built their own 
the state department of transportation estimated building a 
temporary bridge would take two weeks and cost at least 50000 
but the local people built theirs in two days with donated 
materials their own labor and 7722 
about half of the residents along the road are amish and 
mennonite farmers who drive horses and buggies and they wanted to 
avoid the proposed detour along two miles of bumpy dirt road 
didnt cost the state a thing said harold graves who 
helped organize the bridge work when it was built in june we 
saved them money and we saved everyone around here a lot of money 
and inconvenience 
the temporary bridge which had no trouble passing state 
inspection will be out of business in about two weeks the new 
239000 permanent bridge is almost finished

republican dan quayle says he views this 
weeks vice presidential debate with lloyd bentsen as a golden 
opportunity for me to just be myself and to focus on his real 
opponent democratic nominee michael dukakis 
the indiana senator said in a weekend interview with the 
associated press that hes not worried about making any of his 
celebrated gaffes during the nationally televised debate at omaha 
neb on wednesday although theres always that possibility 
sounding confident about the confrontation with his democratic 
counterpart quayle said i will be prepared ill be ready 
the gop vice presidential nominee said he will target his 
attacks on dukakis rather than bentsen the texas senator whose 
views quayle said are more in tune with republicans than democrats 
the opponent for me is michael dukakis quayle said hes 
the one thats running for president hes the one that if he would 
get in i think itd be very difficult time for this country 
my target and my discussion and my focus that evening will be on 
the governor from massachusetts 
quayle and bentsen home in texas are spending the next two 
days making final preparations for their debate dukakis embarks 
monday on a campaign tour of major industrial states including 
michigan illinois and ohio while gop nominee george bush flies 
to california to greet the discovery space shuttle astronauts when 
they land at edwards air force base 
on wednesday night quayle will field the first question from 
the panel of journalists he admitted he is somewhat nervous but 
said the butterflies will be gone when i get out there 
quayle is most comfortable speaking extemporaneously with the 
help of a few notecards public speaking is very easy he said 
quayles campaign as bushs running mate has been dogged by 
intense media scrutiny into his military service academic record 
and personal life and he occasionally has responded with highly 
publicized misstatements 
he said his malapropisms usually uttered when he is not reading 
a prepared text have been blown out of proportion 
when you make as many speeches and you talk as much as i do 
and you get away from the text its always a possiblity to get a 
few words tangled here and there but its a very small number of 
miscues he said 
quayle said he is not worried about slipups on wednesday 
the reason im not is because its going to be questions and 
answers theres always that possibility but im a very confident 
person he said 
campaign strategists have said that because quayle has been 
portrayed as a lightweight candidate anything short of a major 
blunder during the debate will allow him to surpass the low 
expectations for his performance 
im treating it as an opportunity to get up there respond to 
the questions tell the american people where i want to lead this 
country with george bush and articulate a vision for the 
future quayle said 
so i dont look at it as low expectations high expectations 
ill leave that to others what i perceive this debate as is a 
golden opportunity for me to just be myself he said 
his aides say they have advised quayle 41 to tone down his 
boyish exuberance so he will appear dignified and mature beside the 
67yearold bentsen quayle has been coached to speak more slowly 
and curb his hand gestures during the debate 
quayle said he is not worried about being compared unfavorably 
with bentsen 
age alone is not the only qualification for vice president or 
president you have to look at experience youve got to look at 
judgment youve got to look if you can make a difference he 
said 
i believe i can make a difference like i have made a 
difference in areas like job training and national defense 
quayle says his debate with bentsen will have some impact on the 
electorate but how much is uncertain 
when they go in that voting booth theyre going to be voting 
for a president of the united states and thats where their 
attention is going to be and thats where the election is going to 
be decided he said

a school bus driver who was mistakenly 
jailed twice and accused of being a navy deserter may be at the end 
of his military troubles after authorities caught the man they 
believe used his identity to enlist and then disappear 
navy authorities took custody saturday of dartanyian morgan 29 
of suburban calumet city who had been arrested earlier in the week 
on charges of stealing auto parts according to oak lawn police 
sgt robert smith 
morgan was found to be carrying a military identification card 
with his own photo but the name of william finch the card said he 
had served on the uss roosevelt smith said 
the navy has been looking for william finch ever since a sailor 
by that name disappeared from the roosevelt 18 months ago 
school bus driver william finch 22 of chicago has been hauled 
in twice during that time as a deserter most recently sept 25 
even though he never enlisted in the navy the fake finch used 
finchs name and social security number to enter the military navy 
authorities said 
we picked up the real wrong finch and im sure william 
finch is a happier guy today smith said saturday he morgan 
said he was sorry finch got locked up and everything 
smith said he heard a radio news report friday about the real 
finchs troubles with the navy after morgan had been arrested and 
released on bond wednesday on the theft charges 
i thought i dont believe it smith said what a lucky 
coincidence the timing was perfect 
when morgan came to the police station to pick up his car friday 
evening he was arrested and held overnight until navy authorities 
could pick him up smith said 
morgan told police he previously had served in the navy under 
his own name and was discharged then reenlisted using the social 
security number of finch a former neighbor smith said finch had 
been a neighbor of his 
he just said he had enough and decided to get out because he 
got tired of using finchs name there smith said 
bus driver finch was released from custody thursday at the great 
lakes naval training center in north chicago where he had been 
held after illinois state police arrested him four days earlier 
he was arrested after a routine license plate check revealed an 
outstanding arrest warrant issued for the deserter using finchs 
name

sunday was last call for tipplers at moby 
dicks bar a onetime haunt of politicians and pro athletes that 
turned rowdy and wound up as the last business on what was once the 
citys most crimeridden block 
under a city condemnation edict a wrecking ball will obliterate 
the block that was considered until other spots closed in the last 
few months the most decadent strip of entertainment establishments 
in minnesota 
crime statistics in minneapolis pale in comparison to bigger 
cities but moby dicks and its neighbors were hard to ignore on 
busy hennepin avenue just a block from the heart of the citys 
downtown shopping district 
before 1971 the bar was the 620 club once owned by former 
minnesota vikings president max winter 
it was a bar and restaurant that catered to politicians from 
hubert humphrey on down said chuck lutz referring to the late 
senator and vice president it was the gathering place for the 
social elite 
lutz is an official of the minneapolis community development 
agency who led the drive to raze the block for redevelopment 
in 1971 the bar was sold and became moby dicks which 
advertised a whale of a drink on the cheap it also became a 
moby dicksize headache for local officials 
before the condemnation process started its neighboring 
buildings housed porn shops strippers prostitutes and transients 
the block was home to about onefourth of all downtown crime lutz 
said 
the 600 trouble calls made to moby dicks by police in 1986 were 
several hundred more than to any other address in the city 
said police sgt dave niebur 
that bar has been a whale of a problem for the police 
department ever since it opened said niebur 
last december niebur led a raid on moby dicks in which seven 
weapons were confiscated along with a supermarket of illicit 
drugs from a crowd of about 300 customers 
the raid and sales of drugs to undercover officers by employees 
and customers resulted in a 30day suspension of the bars liquor 
license in march and april 
during that period crime on the block dropped 30 percent 
niebur said 
mobys is a perfect example of the type of cesspool that 
breeds crime youve got to attack it said tony bouza police 
chief in this midwest city of 360000 people set in a metropolitan 
area of about 2 million 
its true that people from out of town have commented that 
this block doesnt appear to be that bad lutz said but thats 
relative it depends on the level of crime in a city itself 
about 50 murders have been committed so far this year in 
minneapolis bouza said sunday i would say minneapolis is still 
a fairly safe city he added 
according to fbi figures for 1986 minnesotas major crime rate 
per 100000 people was 25 compared with 107 for new york 113 
for michigan and california and 117 for florida 
under quick take condemnation proceedings the city acquired 
the entire block this year and ordered tenants out 
demolition is scheduled to start later this month to make way 
for a parking lot and possibly a 75 million complex of gleaming 
entertainment retail and hotel space 
moby dicks will be missed if not by police then by patrons 
preston atlas 66 a retired construction worker has frequented 
it since 1971 
if you never brought trouble in here you never got trouble 
atlas said from his regular perch at mobys 50foot rectangular 
bar i hate to see it go 
theres just as much bad out in the suburbs said regular 
james champs 44 
this place at one time was a great taste of the big city 
said former bartender billy burns 31 if you wanted trouble you 
could find it real easy but thats not what most people came here 
for

negotiators representing iran and the united 
states met sunday to discuss the release of eight americans and one 
briton held hostage in lebanon the editor of an israeli newspaper 
said 
according to our information meetings have been going on 
during the weekend and will continue through the week in the same 
place said hesh kestin managing editor of the nation newspaper 
kestin said in an interview that the sessions were being held 
near geneva and included delegations representing iran and the 
united states and a mixed group of intermediaries he did not 
elaborate 
the nation an englishlanguage weekly that began publication a 
month ago reported friday that the united states has struck a 
secret deal with iran promising economic aid and arms sales in 
exchange for the release of eight of the nine american hostages in 
lebanon the newspaper said 
it said the deal would include the release of frozen iranian 
assets in us banks and the resumption of diplomatic relations 
president reagan white house officials and the state department 
all denied the report 
according to the nation which quoted unidentified sources in 
geneva iran would secure the release of five american hostages on 
or around oct 7 a second group of hostages including three 
americans and a briton possibly terry waite a special envoy of 
the archbishop of canterbury would be released a week later the 
report said 
all are believed held by shiite moslem groups loyal to iran 
we are not negotiating directly with iran reagan told 
reporters friday we have not talked to the kidnappers i think 
maybe iran is putting these stories out 
asked about the denials kestin said i think there probably 
are very strong reasons why reagan and the whole administration are 
backing off the story but i think everyone is taking it 
seriously 
the us embassy in israel was following the hostage situation 
but the denials from washington stand according to an embassy 
official who requested anonymity 
seventeen foreign hostages are held in lebanon the hostage held 
longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
waite disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1987 while trying to 
negotiate the release of hostages 
in beirut on saturday kidnappers holding three american 
educators and an indian professor said they would release one 
hostage to increase us support for palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the group the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free 
or when 
the wife of us hostage jesse turner a professor of 
mathematics and computor science said sunday she was hopeful that 
her husband two other american educators and an indian colleague 
will be freed soon after their captors release one of them 
this is an encouraging sign i hope the captors will fulfill 
their promise to release one of the hostages whoever they choose 
to free because that would mean the others have a much better 
chance badr turner said in beirut on sunday

the foreign minister would 
neither confirm nor deny reports sunday that south african 
president pw botha has promised the unconditional release of 
nelson mandela 
pik botha was responding to reports that the president promised 
the release of the jailed african national congress leader during a 
meeting saturday with president mobutu sese seko of zaire 
mobutu was quoted sunday in the washington post as saying i 
obtained from botha a firm commitment that mandela will soon be 
freed without any conditions that he will be allowed to return to 
his home without any constraints 
a french news report also said president botha told mobutu he 
would release mandela 
mandela 70 is considered the most popular leader among south 
africas disenfranchised black majority he has been jailed since 
1962 and is serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to 
overthrow the government 
the post quoted mobutu as saying in a telephone interview that 
botha gave his solemn promise he will not send mandela back to 
prison once he recovers from tuberculosis in a cape town nursing 
home 
the report was at first denied by roland darroll a foreign 
ministry spokesman darroll said mobutu if quoted properly was 
overstating the gist of the summit discussion 
however the statement issued later by foreign minister botha 
avoided contradicting mobutu and left open the possibility 
president botha may indeed have made some type of promise pik and 
pw botha are not related 
the statement said the only agreed version of the discussion 
concerning mr mandelas release is contained in a joint communique 
issued at the conclusion of the talks 
in this communique mobutu said he was encouraged by the 
flexible approach taken by president botha regarding mandela 
botha frequently has said he would release mandela in exchange 
for mandelas renunciation of violence mandela has refused to 
repudiate the violent tactics of the outlawed anc the main group 
fighting south africas government

british airways said sunday it will ban smoking on 
all domestic flights beginning oct 30 but not on international 
routes 
the surveys tell us the longer the flights the less support 
there is for a ban said jim harris british airways marketing 
director 
he said the ban was supported by research conducted among 2199 
domestic passengers in august that showed 85 percent of nonsmokers 
and 42 percent of smokers supported a smoking ban on flights of up 
to one hour 
more than half the passengers 59 percent said they would be 
more inclined to fly with british airways if the smoking ban were 
introduced compared with 12 percent who said they would be less 
inclined to do so he said 
harris said the survey results showed fewer than 30 percent of 
passengers now smoke on british airways flights 
british airways the countrys largest airline carries about 5 
million passengers annually on its domestic flights 
three small british carriers air uk loganair and paramount 
airways also have banned smoking on domestic as well as 
international flights 
but british airways main domestic competitior british midland 
airways continues to offer smoking sections 
smoking bans already have been introduced on most american 
canadian and australian domestic flights 
unlike the united states where the government forces airlines 
to ban smoking on all domestic flights shorter than two hours 
britain has no national laws concerning smoking 
almost 34 percent of british adults smoke cigarettes

former cia chief stansfield turner said sunday 
george bush fostered close ties with gen manuel noriega but he 
did not know whether the vice president played a role in 
reinstating the panamanian ruler to the cia payroll in the 1980s 
its not a coincidence that every time bush was in the 
government we were very friendly with the noriegas and the 
marcoses former philippine president ferdinand marcos and that 
ilk said turner who headed the agency in the carter 
administration and now supports presidential candidate michael 
dukakis 
turner in a telephone interview from new orleans said noriega 
was taken off the cia payroll after turner became director in march 
1977 but payments to noriega resumed during the reagan 
administration turner said 
turner denied published reports that he had accused bush of 
instigating a resumption of cia payments to noriega 
but he said that during his term at the cia payments to a 
powerful figure such as noriega would have been brought to the 
attention of the president 
noriega had been a very small player in panama turner said 
but during president reagans term noriega was the de facto head of 
state you dont put a head of state on the payroll without 
considerable attention to it which normally would be to the top 
he said 
steve hart bush spokesman denied on friday that the republican 
presidential candidate had anything to do with putting noriega back 
on the cia payroll bush as vice president would have no formal 
role in approving such payments he said 
the reagan administration has indicted noriega on drug 
trafficking charges and tried to remove him as panamas leader 
turner said the us relationship with noriega was warmer and 
stronger when bush was in government than at other times for 
instance bush met with noriega both as cia director and vice 
president noriega also received money from the united states 
during those points in bushs career 
turner said he never met noriega although he served at the cia 
longer than bush did bush was cia director for a year 
he also said bush in the first presidential debate last week 
tried to make it appear that everyone was friendly with noriega 
that is patently untrue he said 
turner also claimed bush misused the cia in his campaign 
referring to remarks in the debate about cia briefings both 
presidential candidates received bush said both he and dukakis 
were told that seven administrations were involved with noriega 
turner said the fact that the briefing went into great detail 
about noriegas involvement with previous administrations was 
designed to give bush a debating point and weaken dukakis 
criticism of reagan administration ties to noriega 
turner called it a set up and said this is a real serious 
problem you cannot use the cia for domestic political purposes 
without running the credibility of the organization into the 
ground 
turner said he supports dukakis for president so americans can 
return to some sort of ethical center but said he does not 
work for the dukakis campaign 
since leaving the cia turner has written a book and given 
lectures he sits on the boards of several corporations

q i have a question for rick and dick can you give us some 
idea of your flight plan for tomorrow your landing patterns and 
what landmarks youll be looking for as you come in 
hauck well be coming in just about between los angeles and 
santa barbara overhead the coast at about 110000 feet and 
circling around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds 
permit to land on edwards runway 17 well pass overhead the field 
at about 40000 feet becoming subsonic you all can hear as were 
supersonic a double sonic boom when you hear that youll know 
were about five minutes from landing and then well make a 
standard approach 300 miles per hour coming down to a touchdown 
at 200 miles per hour on that lakebed 
q for mike lounge there are two men now running for president 
what would you say to them from the shuttle to convince them to 
fully support the space program and its longterm future even if it 
means putting up budget increases for nasa in a time of 
considerable deficits 
lounge thats a tough one i think we have to take the long 
view this is a very important flight simply because its the first 
step i would hope that all of the enthusiasm that weve seen 
throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens 
and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if were going to make 
this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to get us on 
the path to the future 
q gentlemen the challenger crew set out to teach some very 
important lessons to the children of the world i would like to 
know what lessons you would hope would be taken from your flight 
and the effort it took to get to where you are today 
covey john ive got a couple of young daughters and i know 
what i would like them to learn from what ive done is that there 
is always a reward for hard work both individually and as a group 
much like the effort that was put forth by nasa and the contractors 
to get the space shuttle flying again and that there are new 
adventures everywhere and space is one of them and hopefully that 
all of the young children out there who want to come to space 
someday will at least have the opportunity to try 
q for commander hauck admiral truly told us yesterday that 
nasa really threaded the needle on your launch with the extra 
emphasis on safety and a lot of flexibility apparently in the 
launch schedule do you think the launch came a little too close to 
violating the safety criteria 
hauck oh as i understand your question do we think the launch 
came too close to violating safety criteria not from my 
perspective that is we were very comfortable with the liftoff as 
it was executed we thought the launch team as a matter of fact 
after main engine cutoff we were complimentary within ourselves to 
the launch team and the way they handled a few minor annoyances 
down close to the launch the question of our cabin pressure and so 
forth from our perspective we couldnt have been happier with the 
way that launch went off and the countdown too 
q i have a question for pinky nelson as a trained research 
scientist can you tell us how well the several experiments that 
you have managed could have been executed by automated equipment 
with no people on board 
nelson well to be honest with you a number of these could have 
been run automated the advantage of running them in the mode that 
we have interrupted by signal drop let me add one thing and 
that is all of the experiments that we brought on board this time 
have exceeded my expectations in the way they have run 
q do you feel you have fulfilled all the objectives of the 
mission and what if any recommendations do you have for changes 
in the orbiter 
hauck the machine worked superbly im not sure that weve had 
a mission that has been this troublefree with an orbiter before 
have to talk with the folks on the ground i guess we have flown 
with our launch and entry suits for the first time since the first 
four missions we do find those to be a bit of an encumbrance 
well need to talk very seriously about whether theres a bit of a 
ill call it a bit of compromise that we would like to make its 
certainly a trade between the advantage that the suit gives us 
should we have a problem and the fact that it doesnt allow us 
quite the flexibility that we had before i guess thats the major 
one and i cant think of any others 
q whats the hispanic contribution to the space program so far 
hauck could you repeat the question please 
q the question is what is the hispanic contribution to 
spaceflight before 
hauck well id say theres no doubt about it that weve 
hundreds of thousands of people out throughout the united states 
that have worked on the space program and i think that every race 
every minority group is represented they may not be represented to 
the degree that that group might like but i know that in our 
travels throughout the country to the various centers and the 
contractors we have spoken with a number of hispanics and many of 
which we have worked closely with at the johnson space center and i 
think its really a contribution of the american people that were 
really very proud of 
q weve heard a lot in the last few days about the cabin 
getting warm can you tell us how comfortable are you and the rest 
of the crew as far as cabin temperature and what kinds of things 
are your doing to keep cool 
lounge it was a little warmer than it is now in the first 
couple of days of the flight because of the flash evaporator 
problem today we feel weve got that working pretty well weve 
been boiling water all day long to cool the vehicle and i put on a 
longsleeve shirt and weve all got long pants on for the first 
time its not been bad at all really 
q pinky good wishes from everyone in minnesota especially our 
home town in willmar before you left you said you were going to 
monitor your own physical and mental responses to the liftoff phase 
of the mission because you had not specific tasks what did you 
learn 
nelson were going to have a good tolerance for heat i guess 
its pretty warm in the suit this is where i launched there where 
dick covey is sitting i didnt have much of a view so i paid a lot 
of attention to my body its difficult to breathe during the 3 g 
part of the flight mainly because of the weight of the suit and 
the harness you can feel a little bit of the inside of your body 
shifting around with the weight and then shifting back again as the 
engines cut off ive got some more on my tape some place ill 
have to tell you about it later

steve reeves the former mr america who played 
hercules in the movies says olympic athletes who need steroids to 
win should take up something less strenuous like pingpong 
reeves who was honored by the association of oldetime barbell amp 
strongmen at the downtown athletic club on saturday night said he 
thought the use of steroids was cheating 
since i won mr america about 40 years ago bodybuilding and 
weightlifting have come a long way but in my opinion it has come 
the wrong way in the last 30 years he said 
i believe if a man does not have enough male hormones in his 
body to produce a championship physique or strength he should take 
up some other sport like pingpong 
canadian sprinter ben johnson was stripped of his olympic gold 
medal for the 100meter dash after drug tests uncovered that he had 
used steroids nine other olympic athletes were also disqualified 
because of use of various drugs

q we thought they were going to keep you on the ground at the 
cape because of highlevel winds that were blowing in wrong 
direction during your ascent could you tell that at all did it 
have any effect whatsoever on the vehicle when you reached 30000 
to 40000 foot 
hauck no those are forces that are masked and would be masked 
by the vibrations that we feel just from the resonance and acoustic 
vibrations from the solid rocket motors we would not have expected 
to feel them and we did not 
q to mike lounge in the opening comments you talked about the 
challenger dream being alive in your hearts since it appears 
youve had a little extra time on this mission after the satellite 
deployment on thursday i was wondering if you might be able to 
share with us some of the hearttoheart talks that you all have 
had among yourselves during the flight 
lounge ah no probably not those arent the kinds of things 
you share weve done a lot of thinking about our friends that we 
lost 2 years ago and ive done a lot of contemplating on that 
personally as im drifting off to sleep at nights and its good to 
be back where they wanted to go so badly 
q for rick or for pinky when it comes to safety and rescue do 
you think the united states should go together with russia and 
europe and canada and other countries and if there should be some 
standards 
nelson if the question is how are we going to handle 
international cooperation within our own program i think you do 
that through planning ahead of time through standards that you set 
and through the procedures that you use so that by the time you get 
around to flying with an international group or international 
crew youre all working with the same procedures you all have the 
same knowledge and capabilities of carrying those out so that 
theres really going to be no difference among the crew whether 
its all american or has internationals on board 
q could you appraise the mission management team process before 
liftoff and whether you can tell your colleagues who will follow 
you if it works well 
hauck well this gives me an opportunity to thank my good 
friend captain bob crippen for the outstanding job that he did from 
our perspective in pulling that all together and this didnt all 
just happen of course in the last few days before the launch it 
was a manymonth effort and i thought that management team of all 
that i saw in close at the frrs for the main engine firings and 
frrs for the orbiter itself i was just very happy and i think 
that bodes very well for the way we do business 
q youve been taking photos of phenomena on earth such as 
volcanoes in africa and hurricane damage in mexico what have you 
observed there that might be of value to those areas 
hilmers well i think some of the biggest things that weve 
seen are things like deforestations weve seen erosion weve seen 
some land usage that kind of disturbs us and i think the good 
lesson is that we take back these photos to men on earth in their 
respective countries to make sure that they take care of what 
nature has given them and to make sure it is used wisely our 
environment is a very fragile thing and i think thats something 
that were very impressed by when we take photos and as we look out 
the window 
q have you caught yourself being so excited at times or other 
crew members around you that youve had to subdue yourself 
hauck yes yes we do as a matter of fact its good that were 
i think if we were a crew of one the possibility of getting 
distracted by the beautiful sights and the fun of being up here 
could perhaps cause you to not pay enough attention to what youre 
doing the crew concept is a wonderful thing and it keeps us on our 
toes 
q on liftoff day there was an agreement signed in washington 
between europe japan canada and united states about freedom the 
space station do you have any comment on that 
hauck i think thats great that just means we can pull 
together even more time working on the same problems and the same 
solutions and if theres a team up here that can get a lot more 
done than five people individually theres no question that the 
unique cultures that each of the international partners bring to 
this effort will be synergistic and make the whole bigger than the 
sum of the parts 
q what do you think now pinky about the future of the space 
shuttle as a platform for scientific platform 
nelson i think the future is bright for a scientific use for 
the space shuttle as i mentioned before the middeck that were in 
is really a national resource many scientists will be glad to have 
a room this size with zero gravity inside it that has electricity 
and water available for them to do their experiments in i think it 
will be used extensively in the future probably primarily as a 
development lab as a test bed for experiments such as the ones 
weve got on board where prototypes can be tested and where new 
concepts can be proven that can then later be developed and 
expanded and put into freeflying satellites or put on board the 
space station in production facilities 
q as you get ready for landing do the problems with the flash 
evaporator system and one of the oms rockets concern you if no why 
not 
hauck well of course theyre something that concerns you if 
you have the next failure our understanding right now is that the 
flash evaporator though we expect it to work almost fully up to 
its potential and we could sustain another failure and still be in 
good shape thats also the case with the orbital maneuvering 
engines its true that we do have one thrust vector control system 
down on the last engine but we have a backup and we also have the 
capability of locking that control system in its current position 
and still deorbit plus we could shut down one engine and come 
back on the other engine and if that would fail we could come back 
on the reaction control system so we have quite a backup 
capability there

a special federal advisory committee meets 
later this month to formalize its tentative recommendation 
supporting the use of intentionally aborted fetal tissue for 
research 
the emotional nature of the issue has been underscored by a 
roman catholic theologians strong exception to the way the outcome 
of the panels threeday session last month was portrayed 
but father james t burtchaell a professor of theology at the 
university of notre dame and a member of the national institutes of 
health does not dispute that the earlier committee action made 
clear the panel will recommend going forward with fetal tissue 
research when it completes a written report 
the 21member committee meets oct 2021 to take final action on 
a report to be forwarded to a standing nih advisory committee by 
nov 1 
burtchaell has contended that news accounts assigned more 
finality to the action of the committee on sept 16 than was 
technically warranted 
there was clearly a sense in which the committee was going 
burtchaell said in a recent telephone interview there was 
clearly a drift 
what i objected to was a variety of statements saying that we 
had recommended something albeit tentatively he said we 
didnt recommended a thing 
the key vote was a 190 count with two abstentions that was 
reported as the committees tentative recommendation 
burtchaell maintains that not only was the vote a procedural 
one to get language on the table for discussion but that it 
ultimately was annulled anyway 
retired federal appeals judge arlin m adams of philadelphia 
the panel chairman disagrees 
adams characterizing himself as a conservative with serious 
concerns about the morality of abortion said he was sensitive to 
burtchaells underlying concern that the committees earlier action 
could be taken as a tacit approval of the morality of abortion 
but he specifically declined to back burtchaells position that 
the reporting was misleading on the fundamental question of whether 
the committee clearly albeit tentatively lined up in favor of 
recommending going forward with fetal tissue research 
in effect what we said and this was only tentative we are 
willing to go ahead with the use of fetal tissue in medical 
research if we could take a series of steps to insure that the 
abortion procedure is sufficiently insulated from the medical 
research that comes afterward said adams 
we were very careful not to deal with the highly volatile 
emotional question of abortion we knew it was there but we 
advertently decided not to deal with it we never could have made 
any progress had we gotten into that area because the commission 
would have been sharply divided

actress carol burnett in moscow to help the 
soviet union fight its alcoholism problem said sunday that a 
hotline session taught her the disease makes no distinction between 
people of the two superpowers 
the problems are the same the feelings are the same the love 
is the same miss burnett told reporters during an informal 
meeting sponsored by the sovietus joint conference on alcoholism 
and drug addiction 
the only difference is the language she said 
miss burnett daughter of two alcoholics and mother of a 
daughter who struggled with drug addiction arrived in moscow on 
friday to share her experiences with soviets 
on saturday miss burnett and her daughter carrie hamilton 
talked about addiction for three hours to soviet citizens who 
phoned two telephone numbers published by the youth newspaper 
komsomolskaya pravda the same day miss hamilton marked the 
seventh anniversary of her decision to stop taking drugs 
many people believed it was impossible to achieve sobriety 
miss hamilton said of the callers im here as proof theyre 
wrong 
few callers knew much about the actress and her daughter and it 
didnt matter miss burnett said callers were given a telephone 
number they could contact for further help 
soviet officials said the american actress and comedienne is not 
well known in the soviet union but that they value her knowledge 
and experience as they try new approaches to fighting the countrys 
serious alcohol problem 
in may 1985 in his first major campaign after taking power 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev slashed alcohol production 
raised the drinking age and cut the hours liquor stores could stay 
open 
the labor newspaper trud said in july that since 1985 the 
number of alcoholics in the soviet union had dropped 17 percent 
but it said the number of drug addicts was 25 times higher 
some officials recently have begun to question the effectiveness 
of gorbachevs program 
long lines form outside liquor stores moonshining has created a 
shortage of sugar and alcoholism has come off the streets and into 
the home they say eduard drozhdov moscows chief official in 
charge of drug and alcohol use said in an interview that his 
country now needs a more sophisticated approach 
he said the new plan must include scientific and sociological 
studies of addiction as well greater emphasis on dealing with 
individuals so they recognize that its your problem not 
somebody elses 
with the help of the joint conference on alcohol and drug abuse 
which was formed in 1986 several chapters of alcoholics anonymous 
have been formed in the soviet union 
yuri v valentik head of the department of the psychiatry of 
alcoholism at the soviet scientific center of medicalbiological 
problems of narcology said alcoholics anonymous has provided a 
universally valid method of selfhelp for alcoholics 
jw canty chairman of the joint conference said the moscow 
groups have so far helped one person quit drinking and termed that 
a great success one life is the greatest thing the soviet union 
has 
miss burnett is to address students at the moscow institute of 
foreign langauges on monday and appear on a tuesday morning 
television news program and in a film to be broadcast tuesday 
evening 
miss burnetts visit was sponsored by staterun soviet radio and

the agony of war forged a bond between us 
veterans of the vietnam war and soviet soldiers who survived a 
similar ordeal in afghanistan with both groups discovering they 
had much more to share than combat stories 
we embraced before we even spoke to each other said shad 
meshad of los angeles a former marine who is among a group of 
vietnam veterans visiting their counterparts in the soviet union 
the trip which began sept 26 was arranged to share expertise 
in treating casualties of war among the 21 american specialists of 
artificial limbs computer aids for the handicapped and 
psychological therapy were eight veterans of the vietnam war 
commonalities of their experiences overwhelmed the fact that 
meshads attackers carried soviet rifles or that igor medvedevs

both groups fought in conflicts that carried none of the glory 
of world war ii when the soviet union and united states were 
allies both returned home not as heroes but in many cases as 
problems 
beyond the camaraderie they shared tactics for pressuring the 
government to help those who suffered mental and physical trauma 
while serving their countries 
the americans complained about the lack of help from the 
veterans administration but we have no such organization at 
all said alexander lavrov who served in western afghanistan 
from 1984 to 1986 
more than 100000 red army troops were sent into afghanistan in 
1979 to support government troops against moslem guerrillas they 
began pulling out in may under terms of an accord signed in april 
because the soviet union has insufficient medical care for the 
36000 soldiers injured in afghanistan the experience of the 
american vietnam veterans on how to get help is very important 
lavrov said 
the handicapped are having trouble getting services but the 
afghan veterans with lingering mental problems face a wall of 
ignorance the afghanistan veterans said 
we are back in the ussr but our hearts and our heads are 
not lavrov said when we sleep we often see afghanistan we 
see our dead friends we see the mountains we see our soldiers 
life 
the soviets have absolutely no concept of psychiatric help 
said charles figley a vietnam veteran in the group who is now a 
purdue university psychologist figley wrote some of the earliest 
books on posttraumatic stress syndrome among the former american 
soldiers 
the vietnam veterans returned to an america painfully divided 
over the war but the first soviet veterans of afghanistan came 
home to a nation that didnt even know theyd been to battle 
figley said 
the soviet veterans reported their parents were told they were 
planting flowers and trees that it was environmental assistance 
they were offering the afghanis 
later with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness citizens started to learn about afghanistan 
but its veterans still dont receive the kind of heroworship 
accorded soldiers who served in the great patriotic war against 
the nazi invaders 
nor have they received any special privileges such as 
advancement to the head of the everpresent lines in the soviet 
union medvedev said 
there are no memorials to the afghanistan veterans in a nation 
where nearly every town has a monument to the veterans of world war 
ii 
mikhail a young man from leningrad who lost his best friend in 
afghanistan came to moscow to meet with the veterans to discuss 
efforts to get a memorial built there 
two months ago thousands of soldiers who fought in afghanistan 
gathered in moscows gorky park for a reunion and it was the 
first time many realized the discrepancy between the nations 
treatment of them and its previous soldiers whod risked their 
lives in war figley said

the varied and complex lives of the people killed 
in the crash of northwest airlines flight 255 are being run through 
statistical tables and computers as lawyers seek compensation for 
the victims families 
some of the attorneys handling the 111 suits stemming from the 
aug 16 1987 crash near detroit metropolitan airport have 
estimated that settlements with northwest and mcdonnell douglas 
corp the planes manufacturer could reach 250 million 
in all 156 people died in the crash one passenger a 
4yearold girl survived 
those estimates are derived from what some lawyers concede is an 
imprecise and sometimes intrusive process of evaluating a victims 
life 
in many ways you are following a table said david bunin a 
philadelphiabased actuarial consultant and a specialist in 
personal injury cases its not really the value of a person that 
were determining but lost earning capacity value of future 
support monetary support 
many countries provide extensive social services to people who 
are injured or families who have lost their primary support said 
david katzman a birmingham lawyer whose firm is handling about two 
dozen of the flight 255 suits pending in us district court in 
detroit 
in this country social services are minimal by comparison and 
thats why you hire lawyers and go to court to protect yourself 
three lawsuits stemming from the crash have been settled without 
trial the amounts of those settlements are sealed under court 
orders 
negotiations can take a less decorous turn when attorneys begin 
citing factors such as school records medical data and employment 
history in seeking settlements 
but some of the flight 255 victims survivors said they had no 
alternative but to try to take part in the settlement process 
you have a lot of feelings of anger resentment helplessness 
and torture to see this sort of haggling said lisa recker of 
dearborn whose brother kurt dombronski died in the crash i 
think its obscene for one person to put a price tag on another 
human being 
its cruel to the survivors and the memory of the person but 
thats the way our legal system works she said 
there could never be enough dollars in the world to give me 
back what i want said betty polec of mount clemens whose 
pregnant daughter and soninlaw died in the crash but that is 
the only recourse i have right now 
i feel that if the family does not institute a lawsuit they 
are forgiving northwest and mcdonnell douglas and patting them on 
the back she said

sir sacheverell sitwell poet art critic and last 
of the sitwell trio of literary siblings has died at the age of 
90 his son said 
francis sitwell said his father died saturday at his home 
weston hall near towcester northamptonshire 50 miles north of 
london 
sacheverell and his eccentric brother and sister sir osbert and 
dame edith sitwell were for nearly 50 years the first family of 
british literature 
they were regarded as the spearhead of the avantgarde during 
the 1920s when they were known as the stormy petrels of the 
london scene 
all three were prolific writers and gathered around them some of 
the most talented and creative people of the time 
composer william walton lived in their london apartment for many 
years he wrote music to accompany ediths public readings of her 
poetry and composed belshazzars feast in the stables at weston 
hall 
he made such a frightful din on the piano we had to banish him 
from the house sacheverell once said 
the sitwells organized the 1919 exhibition of french art that 
introduced picasso and modigliani to the british public they were 
parodied by noel coward and their longnosed patrician faces 
invited caricature 
sacheverell sitwell was born nov 15 1897 the youngest child 
of the fourth baronet sitwell and descendant of the saxon earls of 
northumberland 
his first work was published in 1924 and over the next 56 years 
he produced 50 volumes of poems and at least 40 other books on 
travel music art and architecture 
while his brother delighted in scandalizing literary circles 
with his exhibitionism and his equally famous sister became 
renowned for her eccentricity of dress sacheverell preferred to 
spend his time traveling 
he said in 1982 that he had fulfilled a desire of his youth to 
see every beautiful place and thing in the world he rated the 
italian city of venice first and the temples of angkor wat in 
cambodia second 
in 1987 writer philip purser called sir sacheverell an 18th 
century gentleman who has seen all the worlds masterpieces of art 
visited its most beautiful countries read its books collected its 
stories meditated on its curiosities 
in 1950 sitwell wrote the famous atticus column in the sunday 
times for 10 months commenting on amusing events in life around 
him in 1981 the anonymous author of the column at the time 
interviewed him and quoted him as saying about himself and his 
siblings 
we are undervalued obscurity is descending and the only honor 
that i have received is the freedom of the city of lima for giving 
a lecture on velasquez but i am modestly confident about my 
longterm fame 
sitwell biographer john lehmann said in 1969 of the three 
dame edith and sir osbert acquired the greatest fame but there is 
no doubt that sir sacheverell was an extremely gifted writer and 
towards the end of the 20s he wrote poetry that was quite 
outstanding 
dame edith died in 1964 when sir osbert died five years later 
sacheverell became the sixth baronet sitwell 
he continued to write until the death of his wife georgia in 
1980 after nearly 56 years of marriage 
they had two sons and several grandchildren

sixteen killer whales stranded on a 
remote beach on the south coast of west australia were destroyed 
sunday after veterinarians decided they would not survive a rescue 
attempt 
the whales were spotted off the coast sunday morning the day 
after volunteers saved 32 whales that had been beached nearby 
the whales were shot after veterinarians flown in by 
helicopter examined them 
the other 32 whales became stranded thursday after a twoday 
operation involving hundreds of volunteers the whales were 
returned to the water saturday evening 
a helicopter sent early sunday to check that they had not 
stranded themselves again spotted the second group beached high on 
a stretch of coast inaccessible to vehicles 
wildlife officers believe both groups may have been part of a 
much larger pod forced by heavy storms last week to shallow water 
where their navigational systems may have become confused 
dr syd shea executive director of the west australian 
department of conservation and land management said it was decided 
for humanitarian reasons to have the whales killed 
they were severely dehydrated and bruised had liver damage 
blood in their urine and extensive tissue damage he said 
they were in pitiful condition said dave mell a department 
wildlife officer a lot were half buried in the sand 
windblasted and with blistered skins

and would have died en route

st ignatius catholic church celebrated 40 years 
of existence in a poor neighborhood sunday as church leaders 
pledged to fight an archdiocese proposal that would close it and 42 
other innercity churches 
parishioners marked the anniversary with mass a brunch clowns 
to entertain the few children and red balloons printed with the 
ironic theme of the longplanned celebration life begins at 40 
the church was named wednesday as one of 43 to be closed 
dealing another blow to a decaying city losing people business and 
institutions st ignatius would disband and merge with a church 10 
blocks away 
the shakeup affects nearly 8000 roman catholics belonging to 
the churches which are all in detroit except for one in river 
rouge a suburb 
parishioners said the decision appears to contradict what the 
church recently asked parishes to emphasize ministry to the poor 
sick and elderly 
the rev anthony helinski pastor of st ignatius concluded 
mass by saying he has responded to the archdioceses proposal with 
a letter of appeal 
we are disappointed with the report helinski said quoting 
the letter we find it inconsistent with previous archdiocese 
directives 
helinski said he and other parishioners strenuously object 
to the proposal and will meet monday with leaders of the other 
affected churches to mount a campaign against the proposal 
the announcement detailed by cardinal edmund szoka and bishop 
patrick cooney followed four years of study of urban parishes by a 
task force led by cooney the task force found that 43 of the 
citys 112 churches arent viable 
there were many that i thought were thriving parishes but when 
you looked at the total picture that was not true cooney said 
mark and beverly clark pattison members of the st ignatius 
church council charged that the task force never looked closely at 
the parish or gave it an opportunity to defend itself mrs 
pattison said churches were given only two weeks to appeal 
kay federspiel who was secretary at st ignatius for 20 years 
said she hates to hear that the church is closing but she watched 
its decline and anticipated the announcement she moved away a few 
years ago after her house was broken into 
there used to be 1400 parishioners here now there are maybe 
300 she said you see what the neighborhood is like around 
here with the burnedout houses and you cant blame people for 
moving away 
parishioner marianna johnson couldnt count the number of times 
her house or garage has been broken into but she stayed in the 
house where she raised five children a member of st ignatius for 
37 years she said she feels sorrow and anger that it will have to 
merge 
these people need a church johnson said there are too 
many members who belong who are not going to be able to get to st 
davids 
her granddaughter carol pikarski of st clair said the 
impoverished neighborhood needs the positive influence of the 
church 
the people feel like they have been let down she said 
sunday mass is the only time some of them have fellowship with 
other people

labor party leader neil kinnock on 
sunday overwhelmingly defeated a challenge for his job by leftist 
tony benn and appeared certain to use the victory to increase his 
efforts to moderate the socialist party 
in a ballot at the start of the opposition partys annual 
conference kinnock received 88 percent of the votes of an 
electoral college composed of labor union leaders legislators and 
local party branches 
benn a former cabinet member and doyen of the british radical 
left smiled wryly and bowed his head as more than 1000 delegates 
in the winter gardens conference center in this north england 
resort cheered kinnock 
kinnocks deputy roy hattersly also defeated a bid by two 
leftists john prescott and eric heffer to unseat him he won on 
the first ballot with a 66 percent majority 
kinnock hailed the results as a great honor and a great 
trust he is bent on pushing labor toward the center after three 
successive election defeats by conservative prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
kinnock had virtually unanimous backing from britains labor 
union leaders who control 40 percent of the electoral college 
but he also got majority support from local party branches 
which have been traditionally hostile to his leadership as well as 
from all but about 35 of labors 228 legislators in the 650member 
house of commons 
benn an aristocrat who renounced his title conceded before the 
ballot that he had no chance of victory 
but he saw his challenge as perhaps the last chance before the 
next general election which must be held by 1992 to stop what he 
regards as a betrayal of socialism as kinnock seeks to adapt to 
changes wrought by nearly a decade of thatcher government 
there has been a very substantial drift if not a rout to the 
right in the labor party benn told reporters he said kinnock 
has virtually repudiated socialism 
kinnocks main aim at the weeklong convention is to push through 
a wideranging policy review that dumps some of the leftwings 
most cherished principles 
the review drops previous commitments to renationalize 
stateowned industries sold by mrs thatcher and accepts some of 
her unioncurbing laws 
it was begun after labors third successive defeat by mrs 
thatcher in 1987 labor lost power to mrs thatcher in 1979 
benns campaign reopened divisions in the party it also helped 
push kinnock into reaffirming this summer labors votelosing 
commitment to scrap britains nuclear weapons unilaterally and to 
close us nuclear bases in the country 
the nuclear issue is due to be included in the second stage of 
the review at the 1989 conference 
a market opinion and research international poll for the 
prothatcher sunday times of london showed the conservatives with 
44 percent support and labor at 39 percent 
the poll of 1885 voters put support for the two rival center 
parties the social and liberal democratic party and the social 
democratic party at eight and six percent respectively 
however a national opinion poll for the mail on sunday another 
prothatcher london weekly showed twothirds of the 1649 voters 
surveyed thought it was unlikely labor would win the next election 
in a gallup poll for the proconservative sunday telegraph only 
onefourth of 1003 voters questioned said they believed labor will 
form a majority government in the next 10 years

a white teenager challenged a group of 
blacks in a car shortly before he was pulled into the car and shot 
but police said sunday there was no apparent link to other recent 
incidents of racial tension 
todd spillers said whats your problem boy to the blacks 
one of whom apparently had been shooting a gun into the air as the 
group drove down the street an 18yearold companion said 
the shooting occurred about a mile from the hot biscuit 
restaurant where a black was killed in august in what police 
called a racially motivated shooting one of two shootings which 
led to riots by blacks last month however police downplayed the 
idea that saturdays shooting was racerelated 
spillers was reported in satisfactory condition sunday at 
willisknighton hospital where he underwent 4 hours of surgery 
the shreveport times quoted an unidentified friend of spillers 
as saying that the gunman also turned a handgun on him and pulled 
the trigger but the gun apparently was empty 
it just went click the companion said 
the times quoted unidentified witnesses sunday as saying one of 
the attackers said remember the hot biscuit an apparent 
reference to the august restaurant killing 
last month a white woman shot and killed a black in what police 
said was a drug deal gone sour that shooting plus the restaurant 
shooting sparked two days of riots in a predominantly black 
neighborhood of shreveport 
nothing in the investigation to date has produced any 
information that the shooting was solely a racial incident and no 
ties to any of the recent past incidents was uncovered said a 
police statement about spillers shooting officers on duty sunday 
said they had no further information there have been no arrests 
and police said the investigation was continuing 
community leaders said they did not know the reason for the 
shooting and hoped that it was an isolated incident 
but if this is a racial incident it is just another sign of 
how much frustration and how much anger is in a portion of 
shreveports population that has been left out of so much said 
frances bakerjack director of the blackwhite communications task 
force 
larry english president of the naacps shreveport chapter said 
the reported use of the term boy which has in the past been a 
racial insult had lost much of its sting 
certainly among my peers boy is a term used affectionately 
among the races now english said somehow i cannot see 
that invoking anger as it would have 20 years ago 
i know that its not serious enough to warrant the type of 
reaction that obviously took place he said i think the 
youngsters in this community are simply reaction to the atmosphere 
in shreveport right now 
the boys parents said they were shocked that their son would be 
involved in an interracial incident 
todd has a lot of black friends hes easygoing but he wont 
let anyone push him around said his father mike spillers he 
just happened to be there 
police said boy was in a group of young people who were walking 
down the street early saturday morning when the car full of young 
blacks drove by 
a pop was heard according to the police report spillers 
friend told the times that he didnt realize it at the time but 
the sound apparently was a gun being fired into the air 
spillers called out to the car and it stopped and he went over 
to it police said a challenge was issued at which time several 
black males got out of the vehicle and a fistfight ensued the 
police statement said 
spillers friend told the times that spillers ran up to the 
car and said whats your problem boy 
both police and the witness said a passenger in the back seat 
grabbed spillers and pulled him into the car where they grappled 
when i caught up with the car thats when i heard the gun go 
off the witness told the newspaper he said he was also shot at 
but the gun was apparently empty at that point

three haitian soldiers could face deportation or 
long prison terms for forcing their way aboard a new yorkbound 
jetliner in haiti in a quest for political asylum authorities said 
sunday 
the three arrested saturday night when american airlines flight 
658 arrived at kennedy international airport will appear monday in 
us district court on air piracy charges 
the soldiers had surrendered their rifles and pistols before the 
airplane left the capital city of portauprince there were no 
shots fired and no one was injured during the incident 
the soldiers identified as edouine noel 24 nicolas mormil 
23 and jean charlston beinamie 23 were being held at the 
metropolitan correctional center 
the key to their fate will turn on the question of whether they 
were victims or victimizers in haiti said arthur helton director 
of the political asylum committee of the lawyers committee for 
human rights in new york 
the question is are they worthy of refugee protection 
are they merely fugitives from justice or are they refugees from 
persecution helton said sunday 
the fbi the us customs service and the us attorneys office 
were unable to provide any details sunday about the mens motives 
or background 
a port authority detective said saturday night that the men were 
concerned about a communist takeover of haiti although there 
has been turmoil in haiti in recent weeks it generally has not 
been attributed to communists 
lt gen prosper avril was installed as president of haiti on 
sept 17 following a coup by lowerranking soldiers that led to the 
ouster of lt gen henri namphy the coup triggered a military 
uprising that led to the ouster of military commanders loyal to 
namphy and the duvalier family dictatorship that preceded him 
airport employees at the portauprince international airport 
said the soldiers slipped under a wire fence that surrounds the 
airport 
eric boucicault director of american airlines in haiti said 
three soldiers on duty entered at the end of the line of 
passengers with a determined air we could not refuse their 
entrance as a result of negotiation they deposited all their 
arms pistols and rifles in the pilots cabin 
the soldiers were arrested without incident when the airbus 
a300 with 224 passengers and nine crew members arrived in new 
york 
they intended no harm to anyone there was no threat of 
violence james fox director of the fbis new york office said 
after the plane landed they just said they wanted to leave haiti 
for new york city 
assistant us attorney johnny frank said the men could face 
maximum sentences of 20 years to life in prison if convicted of air 
piracy 
the men can expect to be tried before their application for 
political asylum is considered said helton he said the request 
for asylum could be granted even if the men are convicted assuming 
they can prove that they acted out of desperation 
however if they are shown to have been perpetrators of violence 
in haiti they could be deported following their conviction helton 
said 
another possibility is that the haitian government would seek to 
extradite the men such a request would be considered before a 
trial was held in the united states

a college student wounded by a woman who went on 
a shooting rampage at an elementary school said sunday he favors 
tighter controls on handgun ownership but not a ban on the weapons 
i know people who handle guns responsibly and i dont have a 
problem with that said philip andrew 21 of suburban winnetka 
before leading a march against handgun violence 
but andrew said restrictions on who can get guns could have 
prevented laurie dann from embarking on her may 20 attack ms dann 
killed one child and wounded five at hubbard woods elementary 
school in winnetka before bursting into andrews nearby home 
shooting him and fatally shooting herself 
if someone using psychiatric drugs was not allowed to own a 
gun the laurie dann incident could have been prevented he said 
dann was using an experimental drug used to control behavior 
problems she had carried three guns into the school 
this is something i live with every day said andrew who 
was shot in the chest i hope people realize these incidents can 
be prevented 
andrew a senior at the university of illinois who plans to go 
to law school led a group of about 100 people many of whom were 
relatives or friends of victims killed by handguns on the eighth 
annual fivemile walk against handgun violence sponsored by the 
illinois council against handgun violence 
many people marching sunday advocated total handgun bans 
handguns have got to be banned said vera silas whose 
22yearold son anthony upchurch was killed in february leaving 
a widow and two small children i never want to see a family go 
through this its awful its every parents nightmare 
can you imagine the trauma it put on my family to have my son 
gunned down on the street she asked you dont know the 
nightmares ive had and the nights ive spent up wondering what 
would have happened if id been there it hurts it really hurts 
many of the marchers carried signs calling for the elimination 
of handguns while others had placards bearing more personal 
messages 
one youngster carried a sign saying i was daddys little girl 
before someone shot him 
this is an opportunity for these people to reflect on the 
violence against their loved ones and on life said art smith 
executive director of the 3000member organization that sponsored 
the walk we want the families to see this as something positive 
that can come out of tragedy 
at a grant park rally before the march andrew thanked people 
for the support he has received since he was shot 
i hope we all can continue to work for whats possible and 
remember the tragedies and work to prevent them from happening 
again he said

mikhail s gorbachevs overhaul of the power 
structure his assumption of the presidency and the ouster of key 
officials dominated the soviet media on sunday 
gorbachev the soviet communist party leader was named 
president saturday to replace the 79yearold andrei a gromyko 
uniting the top party and government jobs in one man 
reports from saturdays session of the supreme soviet or 
national parliament took up the entire front page of the communist 
party newspaper pravda and other national papers on sunday and 
half of the second page 
many of gorbachevs predecessors including leonid i brezhnev 
and konstantin u chernenko had held both the top party and 
government jobs but gorbachev declined to follow the model when he 
took power in march 1985 
instead gromyko the veteran foreign minister was moved up to 
the largely ceremonial job from which he retired on saturday he 
received a resounding ovation in the kremlin palace of congresses 
from the 1500 deputies of the supreme soviet who voted 
unanimously to accept his resignation and elect gorbachev 
gorbachev pledged in a speech that the soviets or governing 
councils would become more important as the communist party 
withdraws from daytoday management and concentrates on setting 
policy 
the soviets must become the highest authority on their 
territory and eliminate the shortcomings of stagnation he said 
the party will facilitate the enhancement of the role of the 
soviets 
among other changes announced nikolai v talyzin a candidate 
member of the ruling politburo lost his job as a first deputy 
prime minister and was sent as ambassador to the council for mutual 
economic assistance the trade bloc of the soviet union and its 
allies 
talyzin was named in 1985 to be the head of the state planning 
committee which is responsible for the centrl management of the 
soviet economy 
gorbachev has sharply criticized the central management system 
demanding that it give local officials more autonomy 
talyzin was replaced as planning chief by yuri maslyukov in 
february and transfered to the littleknown social development 
bureau the action was a further demotion and made it likely he 
would be removed from the politburo in the future 
alexandra p biryukova enhanced her status as the 
highestranking woman in the party hierarchy during the two days of 
meetings of the partys policymaking central committee and the 
supreme soviet 
on friday the central committee made her a candidate member of 
the politburo the first woman on that body since the time of 
nikita s khrushchev she was relieved of her responsibility for 
light industry in a revamped central committee apparatus and gave 
up her position as a secretary of the central committee 
the following day the supreme soviet named her a deputy prime 
minister 
in the two days of meetings a new kgb chief vladimir 
kryuchkov was named and former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov was 
transferred to responsibility for legal affairs in the central 
committee 
gorbachev retired longtime politburo member mikhail s 
solomentsev and two candidate members vladimir i dolgikh and 
pyotor n demichev who had served as vice president

more than 3500 residents of nitro will 
be evacuated next week while a cylinder of deadly hydrogen cyanide 
from a closed chemical plant is destroyed a federal official said 
sunday 
nitros mayor complained sunday that he is being left in the 
dark on plans 
doug fox the environmental protection agencys onscene 
coordinator at the artel chemical plant said three specialists 
from jet research center inc of mansfield texas will remove and 
blow up the container believed to contain up to 30 pounds of the 
chemical next sunday 
were still firming up the details fox said but it will 
go just as planned before weve gotten over the insurance and 
liability issues 
destruction of the chemical had been planned for sept 25 but 
was canceled because of those issues 
the epa believes the cyanide compound a basic feedstock for 
some chemical products is becoming unstable and in danger of 
exploding on its own it can be fatal if inhaled or absorbed 
directly but it can be destroyed by burning when released from the 
cylinder 
nitro mayor don karnes said sunday that he learned of the new 
date friday but hasnt heard a word from the epa 
my office is right in the hot zone karnes said youd 
think theyd let me know about these things i havent talked to 
anyone from the epa since sept 22 im not that hard to find 
karnes said nitro residents are uneasy because they dont know 
whats taking place at the plant the epa has labeled a potential 
emergency and has placed on the list of superfund cleanup sites 
last monday karnes held a news conference to criticize the epa 
for its handling of the situation fox said he was waiting for the 
controversy to diminish before talking to karnes 
i want to set up a meeting and talk to the mayor early this 
week fox said i told him before the last scheduled evacuation 
that we would schedule a meeting 
the epa angered local officials when it canceled the sept 25 
evacuation just two days before the event oh materials backed 
out at the last minute because it wanted help from american 
cyanamid the company that made the cylinder fox said cyanamid 
refused to cooperate because of insurance and liability problems 
since nitro a town of some 8000 people about 12 miles west of 
charleston is located in both kanawha and putnam counties karnes 
said its tough coordinating two county sheriffs offices a police 
station and the state police he said its also difficult getting 
the residents to move 
the people in this area are accustomed to living around a 
chemical industry he said 
but fox said its important that the residents are evacuated 
because theres a risk that something may happen and cyanide may 
go off the site 
jet research workers will move the cylinder 320 feet to an 
bunker attach two small explosive charges and blast open the 
canister to release and burn off the cyanide 
the dangerous part is when workers carry the cylinder to the 
bunker fox said the chemical could have formed into both a solid 
and a liquid that could mix and explode if the cyanide reacts fox 
said workers will have about 60 to 90 seconds to get away 
federal officials took over the closed plant after a roof 
collapsed on leaking drums whose contents were not all identified 
epa crews have counted more than 3400 drums that must be 
identified and disposed of

a court has issued a felony warrant for a 
methodist pastor who disappeared in august with his wife and 
stepchildren after his wife lost custody of the children 
when the rev norman luecke left faith united methodist church 
he left a handwritten letter to church members admitting his action 
was illegal but saying it was necessary if his wife was to keep her 
children 
luecke and his wife sharon weathers are now wanted on felony 
warrants for interfering with a custody order issued for her two 
children from her previous marriage they could face up to two 
years in prison and a 10000 fine if convicted 
authorities said zachary weathers 7 and his sister bethany 
4 were not returned to ms weathers exhusband lindell weathers 
after their summer visitation with the lueckes ended aug 14 two 
weeks earlier an appeals court had upheld the awarding of custody 
to lindell weathers 
in his letter to church members luecke pleaded for 
understanding 
what we are doing is illegal that bothers me and im sure 
many would disapprove on that basis alone he wrote but what 
the courts have done to sharon and her children is immoral and 
wrong and so we had to choose and take a stand accept what is 
immoral and wrong or do something that is illegal ourselves 
luecke was married with three children of his own and was pastor 
at salem lutheran church in shell lake when he and his wife became 
friends with the weathers couple 
according to court records lindell weathers concluded in 1985 
that his wife had begun a romantic relationship with luecke both 
couples subsequently divorced and luecke eventually resigned from 
the lutheran church married sharon and became a methodist minister 
in 1987 he was named pastor for three methodist churches in 
rusk county 
after a lengthy legal battle circuit judge alvin l kelsey 
awarded lindell custody of the two weathers children saying that 
either he or his exwife would be good parents but described 
sharons new husband the pastor as a liar a cheat and a 
shirker of his own family responsibilities 
two weeks before the couple and the children disappeared the 
state court of appeals upheld kelseys custody decision 
washburn county sheriff don fuller said he sympathizes with 
weathers but is unable to undertake a nationwide search until there 
is evidence the fleeing couple has left wisconsin 
it almost obsesses you said weathers a nursing home 
administrator in shell lake its an unbelievable thing to go 
through from this end so i cant imagine what its like for the 
kids

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen held his first mock debate sunday in preparation for 
his matchup wednesday with republican dan quayle and then flew to 
texas for final preparations 
its really the second presidential debate said susan 
estrich the democratic presidential campaign manager underscoring 
the importance the ticket places on the event estrich headed up a 
cadre of top dukakis campaign aides helping bentsen get ready 
i have a lot of confidence in senator bentsen but dan quayle 
is a very effective debater estrich said downplaying 
expectations that the more senior bentsen is an oddson favorite 
bentsen held his first rehearsal session in a washington hotel 
sunday morning and then flew to san antonio for a fundraiser he 
planned to stay in austin until tuesday evening when the campaign 
planned a rally for his departure to omaha neb the debate site 
rep dennis eckart dohio is playing quayle in the mock 
sessions and described sundays practice as informal but he said 
he scored some points against bentsen sending staff hurrying to 
fill gaps in bentsens briefing book 
i think its a grievous mistake for anyone to underestimate 
quayles ability to perform well in the 90minute television 
session said eckart who has been intensely studying the indiana 
senator including reviewing hours of video tapes 
i think wednesday night is playing on dan quayles home 
court said eckart 
home course quipped estrich referring to quayles frequent 
golf outings 
bentsens press secretary mike mccurry who sat through 
sundays mock session said bentsen appeared uncomfortable 
he does not seem relaxed he said if it were the senate 
floor hed be very comfortable and if it were the senate rules he 
would be very comfortable he said 
bentsen is concerned about the fact that the 41yearold quayle 
is telegenic while the 67yearold bentsen doesnt feel hes good 
before the cameras mccurry said 
one of the goals of the final debate preparation was to get 
bentsen comfortable with the format of the debate 90 minutes of 
questions twominute answers and oneminute responses 
mccurry said he and washington attorney robert barnett were 
playing reporters for the session we slammed him hard from 
beginning to end he said declining to reveal any of the 
questions raised 
despite the seriousness of the effort mccurry said it was not 
without humor 
after a while people started noticing an oil painting in the 
rehearsal room depicting an old english hunting scene 
it was determined that they were quayle hunting he said

french voters in a record low turnout for a 
national election chose members of regional councils sunday 
giving slightly more votes to leftist parties than to the right 
but the results of the runoff elections following a first 
round of voting last week appeared to leave an alliance of 
conservative parties with control of 70 out of the 101 councils 
the right lost only the gironde department in southwestern france 
to the socialists 
although previous regional elections have been seen as tests of 
popular opinion of the national leadership the current government 
of socialist premier michel rocard has been in power only since 
june and its standing did not appear to be at stake in sundays 
voting 
with about 80 percent of the vote counted several polling 
organizations cited by french television estimated the overall 
turnout at 48 percent of those eligible that is the lowest since 
world war ii unofficially breaking the record of 49 percent set 
last week in the first round of regional elections 
the socialists had 39 percent of the popular vote the 
communists 9 percent and other leftist candidates 3 percent 
various conservative parties split up about 48 percent of the vote 
the extremeright national front whose presidential candidate 
jeanmarie le pen won 14 percent of the vote in may got less than 
1 percent all but 13 of its candidates were eliminated in the 
first round and le pen called on his supporters to stay home sunday 
rather than vote for other conservative parties 
there were about 14 million eligible voters onehalf of the 
council seats come up for election every three years 
voters in paris are not involved because the capitals municipal 
council plays the role of a regional council elsewhere in the 
country there are both municipal and regional councils 
once almost totally powerless the councils have gained new 
duties but remain littleknown their activities rarely making the 
news

prime minister yitzhak shamirs hardline likud 
bloc said sunday it was looking into reports that the leftleaning 
labor party used electronic eavesdropping equipment to spy on its 
rival 
the daily hadashot reported sunday that a listening device with 
a 500yard range was found in likud headquarters in tel aviv likud 
spokeswoman arza ankler denied the report 
but the likud was worried after labor admitted it hired two 
former senior officials of the shin bet security service peleg 
radai and rafi malka 
according to the daily haaretz radai and malka were hired to 
spy on likud 
the two men were dismissed from the service in 1986 after 
exposing the shin bet affair in which security agents 
fabricated evidence to conceal their role in the 1984 beating 
deaths of two palestinians captured after hijacking an israeli 
passenger bus 
radai was quoted in the jerusalem post newspaper as saying 
allegations that he and malka now of the private shafran security 
firm were spying on the likud were a despicable lie 
four israeli dailies however quoted likud spokesman danny 
naveh as saying there are signs of an israeli watergate for 
which labor is responsible 
neither radai or malka could be reached sunday to comment on the 
charges 
on sunday ms ankler told the associated press the likud is 
not accusing anyone but we are checking everything and will 
eventually publish our findings 
the labor party strongly denied the reports on alleged spying 
we have never used illegal methods and shall not violate the 
law said labor spokeswoman michal cohen we are not dealing in 
any form of espionage and are not planting microphones 
ms cohen confirmed that labor hired malka and radai but said 
their job was limited to securing the safety of labors data banks 
and installations 
she said the former agents also check people we interview in 
our election campaign broadcasts we want these people to be 
genuine labor supporters and not those who later show up on likud 
broadcasts 
the likud and labor headed by foreign minister shimon peres 
are the two key parties competing in israels nov 1 parliamentary 
elections which are expected to focus on the future of the 
occupied territories israel has held since 1967 
sunday marked the start of a 30day period in which candidates 
are banned from appearing on staterun israel television or from 
speaking on israel radio or israel armed forces radio the ban does 
not include newspapers 
later this month however parties will be given free broadcast 
time for special campaign programs time is allocated according to 
the number of seats each party has in the parliament

tens of thousands of hornhonking 
flagfestooned cars trucks and buses filled with supporters of 
military president augusto pinochet jammed a boulevard sunday in 
support of his continued rule 
the noisy caravan represented the final campaign event before 
wednesdays referendum on whether pinochets 15yearold regime 
should be extended eight more years law required that all 
political activity halt midnight sunday 
after the pinochet rally small groups opposed to the president 
took to the streets some waving banners and chanting hes going 
to fall police broke up some demonstrations with tear gas and 
water cannons and arrested dozens of people police reports said 
the stateoperated television station reported 10 people 
injured two seriously in isolated incidents throughout the day 
including some street clashes between government supporters and 
opponents 
as night approached a heavy police presence was evident 
downtown riot squads in buses and trucks equipped with tear gas 
and water cannons cruised the nearly empty streets 
the progovernment rally sunday was by far the biggest 
demonstration of support for the rightwing 72yearold army 
commander since he and the countrys other military chiefs formally 
proposed on aug 30 that he remain president until 1997 
governmentowned radio nacional said the caravan included more 
than 30000 vehicles manuel figueroa a pinochet campaign 
spokesman said more than 700000 people participated but the 
figure appeared to be exaggerated 
viva pinochet shouted participants many of them young 
people they filled private cars flatbed trucks and buses 
decorated with red white and blue national flags and posters 
showing a smiling pinochet in civilian dress 
loudspeakers atop many vehicles urged a yes vote in the 
referendum while drivers leaned on their horns at the height of 
the demonstration fireworks sailed into the air and exploded

private residence in a fashionable santiago neighborhood the 
president smiled and held a small granddaughter in his arms while

at a secondfloor balcony to acknowledge the noisy cheering of his 
supporters 
if a majority vote in favor of pinochet on wednesday he will 
begin a new eightyear term in march if he is rejected an open 
election is to be held late next year and pinochet will remain in 
office ntil march 1990 
in either case elections for a congress will be held in a year 
the legislature was disbanded when pinochet seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of an 
president salvador allende a marxist 
a 16party opposition coalition staged its final campaign rally 
saturday drawing a crowd of hundreds of thousands of middle and 
workingclass chileans to a closedoff section of highway several 
miles south of downtown 
the government had barred organizers from staging the 
demonstration closer to the citys center 
on saturday night a vast blackout struck much of the country 
santiago was completely without power for about an hour 
authorities blamed the outage on terrorist bombings of three 
electric power line towers no one claimed responsibility for the 
outage

the teenager whose letter was read in space by 
discovery commander frederick h hauck says the experience has 
taught him at least one thing ill do my homework a little more 
often 
philip j morgan 14 wrote to hauck last may as an assignment 
for his eighthgrade science class at st marks catholic school in 
the sheepshead bay section of brooklyn 
in the letter morgan wrote that i am a worried 14yearold 
that is worried about the future i feel that some of americas 
future is riding on you and your crews shoulders i give you all 
the inspiration i can give you because your ride this fall means so 
much to me 
hauck interrupted the crews schedule saturday to read the 
letter he said he hoped it would show young people that we are 
back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits that will 
come in the future 
morgan who is known as pj said sunday that hauck had eased 
his worries a lot 
teacher john d santoro said he made the assignment to the 
seventh and eighthgraders in his earth science class as a way of 
introducing current events of the 85 letters he sent pjs was 
the only one to draw such a personal response santoro said 
although other students received autographed pictures from the 
astronauts 
i thought the fact they had gotten pictures was great 
santoro said but when he read the letter yesterday this was 
unreal 
as he wrote the letter morgan said i was thinking about the 
tragedy of the challenger and how the discovery means so much for 
everybody 
he said hauck had called him last week and said he might read 
the letter from space 
i didnt think hed really read it i didnt think there would 
be enough time the youngster said 
morgan said he was surprised at the attention his letter has 
attracted it was meant as a homework assignment i didnt even 
imagine it would go this far 
morgan now a freshman at bishop ford high school in brooklyn 
said there was a lesson in this ill do my homework a little

king hussein postponed parliamentary 
elections sunday three months after dissolving a legislature in 
which half the seats are held by representatives of the 
israelioccupied west bank 
a senior official told the associated press the king wanted 
to give the government more time to change election laws in line 
with his july decision to cut legal ties with the west bank 
following the july decision hussein suspended the 60member 
lower house of parliament half of whose members represented the 
west bank 
under the constitution new elections are supposed to be held 
within four months of a suspension but the document says the king 
can postpone elections if the cabinet considers them impossible 
no nationwide parliamentary elections have been held in jordan 
since april 1967 israels capture of the west bank that year made 
voting there impossible 
it was the second time in a year that elections scheduled under 
the constitution have been postponed 
elections under a revamped voting law had been set for late last 
year but the king last year postponed them until at least 1989 
saying preparations were not complete 
the suspension of parliament in july triggered a separate 
constitutional call for a vote which the king has now postponed 
parliament itself was revived only in 1984 after a decadelong 
suspension caused in part by the problem of election for west bank 
members a handful of local elections were held to replace east 
bank deputies who had died west bank vacancies were filled by the 
parliament itself 
leaders of several jordanian professional associations and other 
prominant figures petitioned the government last week to hold free 
elections soon 
they also urged it to stop measures to cut jordans legal 
connections with the 15 million palestinians in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
the petition dated sept 27 and made available to journalists on 
sunday was signed by 248 people including several attorneys 
writers and the heads of professional unions 
in addition to the 60member elected lower house jordan has a 
royallyappointed upper house of 30 members

a peace accord has been reached between 
the sandinista government and more than 300 members of an indian 
guerrilla group the official newspaper barricada said sunday 
the report in the ruling sandinista party newspaper said 10 
military commanders of the yatama group agreed to a ceasefire on 
saturday 
yatama led by brooklyn rivera and steman fagot includes 
members of several groups of atlantic coast indians who have been 
fighting the government for more than six years the indians began 
fighting the sandinistas when the government forced them to 
relocate 
barricada said the truce accord includes provisions for medical 
and food assistance to 54 wartorn communities of about 50000 
people it said the former guerrillas retained the right to form 
selfdefense groups but promised to cut their ties with yatama 
neither yatama leaders nor indians who had broken away from the 
group were available for comment 
ceasefire talks with the indians began in may about a month 
after the ussupported rebels known as contras reached a 
temporary truce with the leftist government the contras have yet 
to negotiate a lasting peace agreement with managua 
the yatama indians seek a form of selfgovernment for indigenous 
tribes along a 75mile stretch of the atlantic seaboard called the 
mosquito coast they are not part of the nicaraguan resistance the 
umbrella for most contra organizations 
yatama claims it has 2000 combatants but at least 1000 have 
surrendered in a series of incidents since last year the indian 
war has stopped for the most part along the atlantic 
the indian fight against the sandinistas marked by factionalism 
since its beginnings in 1981 started when the leftist government 
tried to impose authority on the isolated traditionally 
independent region 
tens of thousands of miskito rama and sumo indians were forced 
from their tribal lands when the sandinistas said they uncovered a 
plan to oust government representatives in the junglelike region 
thousands fled tribal homelands across the winding coco river 
into honduras the united nations high commissioner for refugees 
reported that most have returned home 
nicaraguan indians also resisted any exercise of authority over 
them by the rightist proamerican somoza dynasty that ruled for 42 
years until the sandinistas came to power in 1979

said sunday that he believes evil forces are growing in influence 
worldwide but the forces of good ultimately will prevail 
benson concluding the 158th semiannual general conference of 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints said that not 
many years hence jesus christ will return to vanquish all evil 
i testify that wickedness is rapidly expanding in every 
segment of our society it is more highly organized more cleverly 
disguised and more powerfully promoted than ever before benson 
89 said in remarks prepared for the concluding session of the 
twoday conference 
the former us agriculture secretary borrowed the term secret 
combinations from the book of mormon to characterize the evil 
forces threatening the world secret combinations in mormon 
scripture are any set up to acquire power and influence through 
murder and other unlawful means 
secret combinations lusting for power gain and glory are 
flourishing benson said a secret combination that seeks to 
overthrow the freedom of all lands nations and countries is 
increasing in its evil influence and control over america and the 
entire world 
considered the keystone of the mormon faith the book of mormon 
was published by church founder joseph smith in 1830 smith said he 
translated the work from gold plates given him by an angel named 
moroni

an ardent foe of communism and has characterized it as a godless 
conspiracy bent on the overthrow of free nations

after all other faiths had sunk into apostacy the church has 65 
million members

couples to join the churchs 35700member missionary force 
elder david b haight said more mormon couples whose children 
are grown should consider filling fulltime missions there 
presently are 1100 such couples but there is room for 5000 more

emperor hirohito watched the closing ceremonies of 
the olympic games and family members visited his bedside sunday 
one day after a sudden blood loss endangered his fragile health 
the 87yearold hirohito who fell ill with a fever shortly 
before vomiting blood from an intestinal hemorrhage on sept 19 
remained in stable condition early monday said kenji maeda head 
of general affairs for the imperial household agency 
crown prince akihito crown princess michiko and prince aya 
their 22yearold son visited the emperor in his chambers sunday 
the palace said aya gave his grandfather a wood carving of a bird 
a gift from london where the prince is a graduate student at 
oxford university 
imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda told reporters 
hirohito was alert and insisted on watching part of the olympic 
mens marathon on television sunday evening he watched broadcasts 
of the closing ceremonies from seoul south korea 
reports said the emperor temporarily lost consciousness when he 
discharged a large amount of blood from his bowels saturday and his 
blood pressure plummeted he revived after doctors gave him 
emergency blood transfusions 
hirohito continued to lose small amounts of blood sunday and 
received another 4 pint in transfusions bringing the total he has 
received since the onset of the crisis to 102 pints palace 
officials said doctors also administered platelets to thicken his 
blood which has thinned after copious transfusions 
the emperor has now taken in more blood than the total normally 
circulating in his body according to reports 
he ran a fever sunday of about 988 higher than his normal 959 
temperature the palace said 
his temperature fell slightly to 986 monday morning hirohitos 
blood pressure also was high at 162 over 70 compared to 160 over 
74 the previous day threatening to strain his heart and worsen 
internal hemorrhaging a typical normal reading is about 120 over 
80 
kyodo news service quoted palace aides as saying the emperors 
jaundice was worsening and his skin was turning yellow doctors 
fear his strength is waning dangerously as intravenous feeding 
alone cannot provide enough nutrients and hirohito has ingested 
almost no food for two weeks 
court physicians believe the bleeding is coming from the upper 
intestine where hirohito underwent bypass surgery in sept 1987 to 
alleviate pressure on the intestine from an enlarged pancreas 
the palace said tissue samples from the pancreas tested negative 
for cancer but persistent news reports have said hirohito has 
cancer of the upper intestine 
palace officials have discouraged such reports saying they 
could dishearten the emperor but have otherwise refused comment 
under the constitution the emperor is a symbol of the state 
with little real power his duties include receiving foreign 
dignitaries and placing official seals on government documents

democrats who hope sen lloyd bentsen will 
help the ticket win his home state of texas and perhaps the 
presidential election could do well to regard the fate of henry 
gassaway davis 
in case anyone doesnt remember davis was democrat alton b 
parkers running mate when parker ran for president against 
republican teddy roosevelt in 1904 
the voters chose between roosevelt and parker and their choice 
was roosevelt by a 32 margin 
experts concede that the vice presidential debate in omaha 
neb on wednesday between bentsen and republican dan quayle may 
make a difference but they say the voters final decision will 
come down to a choice between the top of the tickets democrat 
michael dukakis and vice president george bush 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
george bush frequently calls michael dukakis 
the stealth candidate who makes his positions invisible on 
political radar but bush himself is doggedly vague on some issues 
when it finds it convenient 
where does the vice president stand for instance on raising 
the minimum wage or on parental job leaves 
as he has reached out to lowincome voters in recent weeks bush 
said he favors boosting the federal minimum wage which has stood 
at 335 an hour for eight years 
on parental leaves he said women should not have to worry about 
getting their jobs back after having a baby or caring for a 
severely ill child 
in neither case however has bush filled in the blanks with 
specifics neither issue is very popular with conservatives and his 
statements leave him at odds with the white house so perhaps the 
less bush says the better

the navy and air force have failed to find a

from a historical standpoint the current accident rates for 
navy and air force fighter and attack jets are not out of line

alltime safest years for aviation 
both services have mounted careful monitoring campaigns because

nine months after the dona paz sank

mystery and secrecy surrounds official investigations into the 
cause of the accident 
the 2215ton dona paz collided dec 20 with the 629ton oil 
tanker vector off mindoro island both vessels exploded in huge 
fireballs 
only 26 of the 1775 people known to be on board the vessels 
were saved but the real death toll may never be known 
manifests on interisland vessels are notoriously inaccurate 
they often record children as half passengers or disregard them 
entirely corrupt officials frequently accept bribes to allow 
overloading 
in addition many victims probably were incinerated when the 
vessels exploded and will never be accounted for rescuers found

klaus k obermeier used to compute only in his 
office now that he has a laptop computer he computes in the back 
seat of the car on the plane beside the pool and even he admits 
in bed 
obermeier who works for battelle memorial institute in 
columbus ohio is the kind of person who is making laptop models 
into one of the hottest segments of the computer business 
until recently laptop computers tended to be underpowered and 
overpriced with small poorly lit screens and batteries that ran 
out at inconvenient times 
those problems have not been conquered completely but enough 
progress has been made to release a flood of pentup demand among 
business people students writers and others 
sales of laptop computers will surpass 1 billion in the united 
states this year and are growing at a rate of 40 percent annually 
according to dataquest inc a market researcher 
this fall in some ways marks the coming of age of laptop 
computers 
this week on monday and tuesday japans toshiba corp and nec 
corp are expected to unveil new models for the laptop market an 
industry segment where they have enjoyed some of their greatest 
success in the united states 
compaq computer corp which disdained the market until now is 
expected to introduce its first laptop model at an oct 17 press 
conference in new york the houstonbased company says only that it 
will announce a new dimension in personal computing 
finally analysts say international business machines corp will 
come out soon with a successor to its 2yearold pc convertible a 
relatively slow machine that has been criticized by computer buffs 
ibm spokesman scott brooks confirmed that a new laptop is planned 
but would not say when it would be available 
as a sign of the markets importance zenith electronics corp 
which dominates the government market for laptops has even managed 
to make the machines the linchpin of its entire data systems 
business 
the laptop market is one that is coming into its own after 
many years of really being a niche market said margaret 
rodenberg vice president of marketing for entre computer centers 
inc a retail chain 
laptop computers have always gotten good press perhaps because 
journalists were some of their earliest users tandy corps radio 
shack trs 80 model 100 even earned an affectionate nickname on the 
campaign trail the trash 80 
but people who needed more computing power shied away from them 
john vanden brink a consultant in des plaines ill said he once 
destroyed an entire database when he tried to transfer something 
out of his radio shack and exceeded the memory limit 
the newest models in contrast are loaded with power toshiba 
and nec are both announcing models this week that use intel corps 
topoftheline 80386 microprocessor pc week newspaper says 
the problem with speedy computers is they are ravenous for 
electricity and drain batteries quickly seizing an opportunity 
chips and technologies inc of san jose calif recently 
introduced a set of chips that will double or triple the length of 
time that many laptops can run on batteries 
prices for laptops are relatively high 2000 to 10000 
because of the expense of the batteries energysaving cmos memory 
chips and the complex technology of flat screens 
the flat screens of laptops flip up like the top of a clamshell 
and usually display 25 lines at a time in comparison to the 40 
lines of a regular personal computer brightness and contrast 
although much improved still dont match those of fullsized pcs 
once on the road laptop owners have abundant headaches no 
place to recharge batteries no modular phone jacks hotel phone 
switches that cant handle data transmissions 3inch disks that 
arent compatible with other peoples 5inch disks 
still something keeps laptop users tapping away 
laptops like cellular phones allow people to keep working 
while others are stuck in traffic or thumbing through the inflight 
magazine they also encourage spontaneity by letting people record 
or try out ideas while they are fresh 
i would say theres like a 150 to 200 percent improvement in 
my productivity i cant even think with a paper and pencil 
anymore said jeffrey greene a laptop enthusiast who works in 
the philadelphia office of hay group inc a washingtonbased 
personnel consulting firm 
of course working through the night on a laptop on a long 
flight can be bad for ones public image said jerry whitcomb a 
consultant at atlantabased management science america inc 
people think youre a workaholic whitcomb said 
whitcomb nonetheless is a confirmed laptop user he even uses 
it in the office it does everything a regular pc does so i dont 
need to have both he said

smithkline beckman corp built its world 
around tagamet an ulcer drug that didnt face competition for its 
first eight years and two years ago was the hottestselling 
medicine anywhere 
today that world is being dismantled 
last year a british company took smithklines premier position 
in the ulcer drug market leaving the philadelphia pharmaceutical 
giant with a 25 percent slide in profits for the second quarter of 
this year 
the company was forced last week to announce a restructuring 
plan that will cost up to 400 million and slash about 1600 jobs 
smithklines problem industry analysts say is its lack of new 
drugs to follow tagamets success 
its every ceos nightmare to have a successful product but 
no followup samuel isaly an analyst with sg warbug amp co in 
new york they were either unlucky or unsmart that they didnt 
have new products to replace the inevitable decline of tagamet 
and dyazide smithklines highly successful blood pressure medicine 
ronald m nordmann an analyst with painewebber inc in new 
york said here we are 24 years later and son of tagamet has yet 
to be developed 
producing a new drug takes several years of research animal 
testing and human trials before it gets the food and drug 
administrations approval for sale work first began on tagamet in 
1964 12 years before it was introduced 
i dont think they have the horses in the stables at this 
point to generate growth nordmann said 
tagamet first hit the british market in 1976 and was introduced 
in the us a year later in 1986 the drug set a record for yearly 
sales of a prescription medication at 1132 billion 
but the competition has been able to catch up with londonbased 
glaxo holdings incs zantac beating tagamet in the ulcer market 
analysts calculate zantac this year has about 40 percent of the 
ulcer drug sales with tagamet at about 30 to 35 percent 
dyazide another smithkline blockbuster hit 365 million in 
sales last year but late in 1987 its first competitor entered the 
market 
smithkline cited dyazides disappointing performance in 
announcing the secondquarter slide in profits but played down 
tagamets role in the reorganization 
tagamet is facing a lot of competition theres no doubt about 
it but if there were less competition and stronger tagamet sales 
than there are i believe we would still be here today talking 
about these decisions henry wendt chief executive officer said 
at a news conference tuesday announcing the restructuring 
analysts however were skeptical about the stated lack of 
effect by tagamet on the situation 
under the restructuring plan smithkline said domestic and 
international drug sales and research which had been the three 
main units of the companys drug business would be consolidated 
while a stronger emphasis would be placed on its other major 
divisions they include beckman instruments diagnostic tools 
allergan inc eye care and smithkline bioscience laboratories 
testing 
about 1600 jobs would be eliminated in the coming years 
including 60 percent of the 500strong corporate staff the company 
said 
the restructuring carries a price tag of 375 to 400 million 
smithkline also said it would sell 17 percent of beckman 
instruments in a public offering of 5 million newly issued shares 
of common stock 
wendt hinted at a possible spinoff of other companies as well 
the plans were received coolly in the days following the 
announcement with the companys stock slipping 3 to 4512 a 
share between tuesday and the close of new york stock exchange 
trading on friday 
the company and analysts expected such public offerings will 
define a high value for the companies and with smithkline 
retaining a majority of the stock the parents market value will 
increase as well 
the restructuring will have an impact on earnings beginning in 
the first three months of next year and yield a savings of about 
100 million each year by 1990 wendt said 
about 40 percent of restructuring cost will cover the costs of 
consolidating manufacuring plants in puerto rico and research in 
suburban philadelphia about 40 percent will be taken up by the 
personnel changes and severance payments and another 20 percent 
will cover other nonrecurring costs associated with the 
reorganization smithkline said

showing signs of recovery floridas citrus 
growers reaped a record 13 billion for their fruit during the 
198788 harvest season ending in july according to a preliminary 
report from the florida agricultural statistics service 
the previous record was 103 billion in 197980 posted before 
a series of severe freezes slashed the states top agricultural 
crop 
orange production reached its highest level since 1983 exports 
of fresh grapefruit set a record juice yields were at alltime 
highs and the price of valencia oranges the main juice variety 
set a record high at 786 a 90pound box 
record prices were caused in part by smallerthanexpected crops 
in brazil floridas main citrus competitor and by exceptionally 
strong demand for fresh grapefruit exports to japan florida 
exported a record 103 million boxes of grapefruit 
it was a very good vintage year said bob terry citrus 
statistician for the state and federal crop reporting service based 
in orlando 
while growers statewide celebrated the numbers those with trees 
in the northern growing areas hit hardest by the freezes are still 
struggling to recover 
lake county which produced more than 44 million boxes of fruit 
in 197980 yielded only 25 million boxes in the most recent 
season 
orange county which produced more than 17 million boxes eight 
years ago produced 31 million 
a federal tree census released last week said the state planted 
a record 125000 acres of citrus trees in 1986 and 1987 but citrus 
trees take several years before they yield fruit and almost a 
decade to reach full production

deere amp co and the united auto workers 
reached a tentative threeyear contract agreement over the weekend 
opening the way for a resumption of talks between the union and 
caterpillar inc 
the tentative settlement between deere and the uaw was announced 
by deere spokesman robert combs at 508 am cdt saturday after 20 
hours of bargaining 
a threatened widespread strike against deere was averted with 
announcement of the agreement 
combs said the agreement would take effect immediately upon 
ratification by the companys 13400 uaw employees at factories and 
warehouses in illinois iowa atlanta minneapolis and denver no 
date was set for a vote 
karl mantyla a uaw spokesman said the agreement was tentative 
and subject to getting language from the company and resolution 
of local issues 
he refused to give details on the proposed contract 
the spotlight now shifts back to the st louis suburb of 
bridgeton mo where negotiators for caterpillar and the uaw 
agreed friday to extend their contract indefinitely and recess 
talks pending the outcome of deere bargaining 
caterpillar spokesman mark polzin said the talks were not 
expected resume until after the deere pact was ratified 
deere was chosen as the target for a settlement or strike 
because union officials believed they had a better opportunity for 
contract gains there 
elliott anderson a chief uaw negotiator in the caterpillar 
talks said the union likely would use the deere contract as a 
pattern for talks with caterpillar 
caterpillar the largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment 
with 58800 employees worldwide will face renewed union demands 
for 100 percent job security a reduction in overtime callback of 
1000 uaw members on layoff and the first merit pay increase in a 
decade 
the union reportedly is seeking a threeyear pact and a three 
percent wage increase in each yeart 
caterpillar wants to hold down costs and is seeking more 
flexibility in job assignments and scheduling and wants to 
restrict employee mobility and save money on retraining 
if talks break down either side can terminate the contract with 
five days notice and caterpillar could face a strike by 17500 
bluecollar workers at plants in 12 cities in illinois iowa york 
penn denver and memphis 
in a highly unusual move in deere negotiations representatives 
of both sides talked past a midnight friday strike deadline with no 
formal extension of the current contract or call for a walkout 
mantyla said the union did not call for a strike but scattered 
pickets were reported at deere plants in east moline ill and 
dubuque iowa 
the tentative settlement averted a fullscale walkout like the 
bitter strike in 198687 that ended after 163 days with employees 
acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions
