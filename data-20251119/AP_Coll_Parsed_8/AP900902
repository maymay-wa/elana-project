on 40 independent stations nationwide is part of a growing 
movement of evangelical preachers who believe territorial 
spirits rule particular cities industries and subcultures 
according to dick bernal pastor of the jubilee christian center 
in san jose san francisco is ruled by the spirit of perversion 
oakland by the spirit of murder san jose by the spirit of greed 
and marin county north of san francisco by the new age spirit 
these evil spirits can be exorcised through militant 
powerpraying such as shouting stomping brandishing imaginary 
swords and speaking in tongues bernal and lea explained 
lea former pastor of the church of the rock in rockwall texas 
oversees 70 pastors and 40000 churchmembers from his dallasbased

city officials were confident they 
could prevent the violence that marred last years labor day beach 
festival but visitors said the heightened security this year was 
also dampening the fun 
fraternities and sororities from predominantly black schools 
along the east coast have held an annual endofsummer fest in 
virginia beach for the last 10 years 
last years festivities were marred by looting and clashes 
between police and collegeaged youths that resulted in 220 
arrests 43 injuries 14 million in damage to stores and 
lingering accusations of police brutality 
to prevent another outbreak the city put its entire 600member 
police force to work and designed a parking plan to keep cars off 
the beach 
by 530 pm 16 people had been arrested 12 for public 
drunkenness said craig andrews media coordinator for laborfest 
hotels were about threequarters full by saturday night but 
merchants said they were doing little more business than a typical 
summer weekend 
its very much toned down this year but probably a little bit 
too much said rodney williams a 21yearold student from 
farmingdale college in new york i understand the need for the 
security measures but this is kind of too much 
after last years violence many black fraternity members 
claimed that white merchants and city officials had been harassing 
them the city appointed a biracial committee to help plan this 
years event 
city officials who estimated the 1989 crowd at more than 
100000 said the problems started because of too many people in 
too small an area with too little to do at 5 pm saturday the 
crowd on the beachfront resort strip was estimated at 28000 
andrews said 
virginia beach police chaplain don r staton said the atmosphere 
was relaxed this year because of fewer people 
places that were usually crowded werent he said 
some of those who did make the trip were unhappy with what they 
found 
theres too much police said ben ogbogu of greenbelt md 
who was making his third annual visit i think thats going to 
cause people to get nervous and start some of the same thing that 
happened last year it doesnt look peaceful it looks militant 
as part of preparations for the weekend the city closed off a 
200block section of the beachfront to cars visitors were directed 
to satellite parking areas with shuttle buses carrying them to and 
from the beach 
tanya dance 23 of wilmington del complained about the 
traffic restrictions im paying 100 a night for a hotel room 
and i cant even go out in my car she said 
saturday morning the main beachfront thoroughfare was nearly 
empty as the afternoon began for what is usually the biggest 
vacation weekend of the year 
you can see the tumbleweeds go down the street said deepak 
nachnani a shop manager its like a ghost town 
others said a holiday without violence would be worth a few lost 
dollars 
i would like to think that we can measure this weekend in 
other than economic terms said flo mcdaniel executive director 
of the virginia beach hotel and motel association 
city officials would not give a number of visitors that would be 
necessary to call laborfest a success 
but arthur jarrett jr president of the student government 
association at norfolk state university and a member of the 
committee that planned the event said success for me is that 
our image is changed from the hellraisers we were depicted as last 
year if im the only one at the beach i want to have a good 
time 
for deborah lee of new york city who came for the action the 
excitement and the men there were still plenty of opportunities 
for enjoying the scenery

a mormon church temple is a favorite mock 
target of military pilots training in stealth fighterbombers a 
utah congressman said 
rep jim hansen a republican said a squadron of the futuristic 
f117a fighterbombers use the illuminated spired temple in st 
george as a target on their mock bombing runs 
the church in st george 250 miles south of salt lake city is 
one of the first mormon temples built in utah 
they take out the st george temple every night i was out 
there watching them do it a few times said hansen a member of 
the house armed services committee 
the f117a was designed to penetrate radar defense and bomb 
targets before enemy forces can react according to the pentagon 
the plane has been flying since 1981 but the pentagon refused to 
even acknowledge it existed until late 1988 
a squadron of the planes recently flew to saudi arabia for 
operation desert shield 
hansen said the figher pilots based at the tonopah test range 
in nevada mean no disrespect to the 17 millionmember church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints based in salt lake 
the commander of the group was a mormon bishop so i guess he 
felt all right taking out the st george temple said hansen who 
spoke thursday to a group of ogdenarea businessmen about us

more than 100 americans and several hundred other foreigners 
left baghdad on jetliners for home saturday but many others 
remained behind prompting president bush to criticize iraq for 
freeing the hostages too slowly 
in another major development bush announced on saturday that he 
and president mikhail s gorbachev will meet in helsinki finland 
on sept 9 to discuss the middle east and other matters including 
arms control 
im glad when any american comes out of there but theres a 
certain brutality a certain tawdry performance in all of this 
bush said when asked about iraqs policy of releasing a few 
hundred captives at a time 
it is so base and so outrageous that i think most people in 
the arab world are very embarrassed by this and i think thats 
certainly true of others around the world bush told reporters in 
kennebunkport maine 
the summit announcement indicates moscow may be willing to play 
a larger role in resolving the crisis caused by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait aug 2 
progress also was reported on another diplomatic front saturday 
sources in amman jordan where un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar and a senior iraqi official met said the two men 
were discussing a plan designed to prevent a war between iraq and 
united states 
the sources said the plan would create an arab peacekeeping 
force to act as a buffer between the tens of thousands of iraqi 
troops in occupied kuwait and the usled multinational force 
being deployed in saudi arabia 
the soviet union might help mediate simultaneous withdrawals of 
iraqi troops from kuwait and opposing forces from saudi arabia the 
sources said 
perez de cuellar and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz expressed 
optimism but neither would comment on the reports when their 
twoday meeting ended 
the talks were very fruitful aziz said this situation is 
complicated and dramatic and cannot be resolved by dramatic 
diplomacy it needs patience it needs time and people to 
understand exactly the positions 
but at a press conference later perez de cuellar said he was 
disappointed more progress had not been made i had hoped for 
more perez de cullar said without elaborating 
the united states meanwhile continued to pour troops and 
military hardware into saudi arabia where a multinational force is 
being deployed to oppose iraqi troops massed near kuwaits border 
with saudi arabia 
until recently american troops had remained well south of saudi 
arabias border but now they are moving north to bolster the 
forces defensive lines and significantly improve its offensive 
capabilities 
us officials say the movement northward of several units 
indicates that us commanders in saudi arabia are now comfortable 
putting troops a good distance away from major supply points 
if nothing else it shows we believe we are now capable of 
sustaining a significant force in forward positions a senior air 
force officer said 
us officials say more than 100000 troops including those 
aboard dozens of ships are in the persian gulf region or on the 
way 
the united states could contribute as many as 250000 soldiers 
to the multinational force which includes token contingents from 
other nations 
for most of the day saturday the united states and other 
nations waited to see how many of the women and children among the 
21000 westerners held hostage in iraq and kuwait would be allowed 
to leave for home 
after lengthy delays an iraqi airways plane with 68 japanese 
women and children aboard was the first to leave iraq for jordan 
it arrived in amman and the hostages were to land in tokyo on 
sunday 
a lufthansa plane took off next with 311 women and children from 
22 countries including about 60 americans of iraqi extraction and 
71 germans the flight landed in frankfurt early sunday 
a few arriving passengers smiled briefly or waved but nearly 
all looked grim and exhausted some women carried sleeping children 
on their shoulders one womans eyes flooded with tears as she 
walked into the terminal 
diana haroon 24 an iraqiamerican from chicago said 
everybody wanted to go back to the united states because we have 
american citizenship and we cant stay there in baghdad all the 
time its not good there 
an iraqi airways 747 left baghdad early saturday bound for 
paris london and washington that flight carried 199 britons 
about 50 americans and more than 20 french citizens although there 
was confusion over the numbers 
the plane arrived in london early sunday after the paris 
stopover then left for washington at 655 local time 155 edt 
the flight was expected to take 7 hours airport officials said 
the british foreign office in london said departure of the iraqi 
airways jetliner from baghdad had been delayed by the late arrival 
of a flight from kuwait city carrying the rev jesse jackson the 
american civil rights activist 
jackson flew to kuwait early saturday to collect sick americans 
after meeting twice with iraqi president saddam hussein to secure 
their release 
jackson eventually brought 26 americans out of kuwait and 
another four who had come out of kuwait by car joined his group in 
baghdad 
the state department estimates that about 1000 american women 
and children were stranded in iraq and kuwait by the invasion 
saddam announced last week that all foreign women and children 
could leave but the process was delayed by red tape and new 
demands by iraq 
national security adviser brent scowcroft joined bush on 
saturday in criticizing saddam for playing a game with the 
hostages in which the rules change daily sometimes hourly 
scowcroft who also spoke with reporters in kennebunkport 
demanded that saddam free all foreign hostages including the 
western men who have been moved to iraqi military installtions to 
deter a possible us attack 
in addition to deploying troops in saudi arabia the united 
states and other nations also are enforcing a trade embargo against 
iraq and it appears the sanctions are beginning to cause hardships 
in iraq 
iraq has issued coupon books to prepare for rationing that began 
saturday and sources in baghdad said food distribution centers 
have been set up 
the coupons entitle each iraqi to a monthly allocation of 13 
pounds of flour 33 pounds of rice 22 pounds of sugar 35 
ounces of tea 11 pounds of oil 17 ounces of detergent and one 
bar of soap the sources said 
children under a year old receive three cans of powdered milk 
each month but older children receive none 
elsewhere in the middle east the persian gulf crisis continued 
to open rifts in the arab world and upset the balance of power in 
the region 
after a twoday meeting in egypt the arab league hardened its 
position on the invasion by demanding iraq pay war reparations to 
kuwait after withdrawing its troops the league also demanded that 
iraq immediately free all hostages 
the crisis also reportedly has left israel egypt and saudi 
arabia scrambling for more arms and financial assistance from the 
united states 
bush administration officials say the president has decided to 
make available more hightech weapons for israel and is considering 
forgiving egypts 67 billion military debt with the united states 
additional weapons for israel would bolster that countrys 
defense against iraq and offset recent decisions to sell saudi 
arabia more tanks and warplanes

lines plane to tokyo

ministry said it did not have any information yet on men aboard the 
flight 
a few arriving passengers smiled briefly or waved but nearly 
all looked grim and exhausted some women carried sleeping children 
on their shoulders one womans eyes flooded with tears as she 
walked into the terminal 
diana haroon 24 an iraqiamerican from chicago said 
everybody wanted to go back to the united states because we have 
american citizenship and we cant stay there in baghdad all the 
time its not good there 
its tough she said describing the situation in iraq 
asked if she was nervous before she was allowed to leave she said 
sure 
a third flight an iraqi airways 747 landed in london after a 
stopover in paris then left for washington at 655 local time 155 
edt the flight was expected to take 7 hours heathrow airport 
officials said 
the 747 was believed to have carried 199 britons about 50 
americans and more than 20 french nationals from baghdad 
the french foreign ministry however said the flight was 
carrying more than 340 evacuees from iraq 
seventeen french women and five children disembarked from the 
plane after it landed at orly international airport south of paris 
and the 199 britons left the flight in london 
one of three american citizens who had requested permission to 
get off in paris was also allowed to disembark so he could visit 
his seriously ill wife in switzerland said us embassy spokesman 
parker hallberg 
there were varying reports on how many americans were on the 
flight hallberg said there were about 40 americans on the plane 
but reports from baghdad indicated about 50 us citizens boarded 
there 
the rev jesse jackson who was aboard the flight said there 
were 55 us evacuees 
there was no evidence of abusive treatment but there was great 
tension jackson told reporters in paris there was a sense of 
jubilation 
a us embassy doctor esther roberts was the only person 
allowed to board the plane during the stopover in paris embassy 
officials said 
its considered an iraqi military mission hallberg said he 
said iraqi security officials were on board the plane but he did 
not know whether they were armed 
there was so much confusion over numbers at baghdad airport that 
not even ambassadors had accurate totals of their own nationals on 
board 
some of the american and british women interviewed at baghdad 
airport before departure said they left husbands behind as part of 
iraqi leader saddam husseins human shield at strategic 
installations to deter any us attack 
our husbands are being held and we dont want to put them in 
danger said an american woman standing in line at baghdad 
airport who declined to give her name 
another debby willis of parkman maine said she and her 
husband jerry willis were trying to escape across the desert from 
kuwait when iraqi troops captured them her husband stayed behind 
at a military site she said 
authorities held the iraqi flight full of americans and britons 
until jackson the american civil rights activist returned from 
kuwait with sick american hostages whose release he gained after 
meeting twice with saddam 
jackson brought 26 hostages out of kuwait including 20 people 
suffering from various illnesses only one of them required a 
stretcher a woman who broke her hip in a car accident while being 
moved from kuwait to baghdad 
four people who had come out of kuwait by car were added to 
jacksons party in baghdad bringing his total to 30 as many as 21 
other americans who had been detained in iraq also boarded the 
flight 
jacksons departure from kuwait was delayed by protracted 
negotiations to bring out an american woman who had called him at 
his hotel with a plea to take her out with him 
jackson was believed to have said he would not leave without her 
at baghdads airport jackson told the associated press this 
is a window of hope and it must be expanded 
he said he was encouraged by his meetings with saddam whom he 
found ready to talk when people are willing to talk that is a 
step in the first direction jackson said there must be a 
cooling of the rhetoric in this quest for peace 
he urged us senators and congressmen to use their influence to 
expand the window of opportunity in iraq adding diplomacy must 
not take a backseat to economic resistance and military 
preparedness 
in all about 21000 westerners were trapped in iraq and kuwait 
by iraqs aug 2 invasion of its oilrich neighbor they included 
3000 americans

un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar indicated sunday that his effort to avert a military 
showdown in the gulf has failed saying he was disappointed by 
iraqs inflexibility 
as i leave i must acknowledge a certain disappointment the 
un chief told a televised news conference after four meetings 
with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
the main problem was the occupation and annexation of kuwait 
by iraq he said 
answering a reporters question in french the secretary general 
said the talks were useful but disappointing i had hoped 
for a more flexible position regarding the retreat of the iraqis 
from kuwait 
the un chief said he was leaving for paris to brief jordans 
king hussein on the outcome of the talks the jordanian monarch an 
ally of iraq has been trying to defuse tensions escalating since 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
hussein is in europe this weekend seeking to avert further 
escalation of the crisis as the usled multinational force 
continued to build in saudi arabia thousands of mostly us troops 
face more than 200000 iraqi soldiers along saudi arabias northern 
borders with iraq and kuwait 
a jordanian official who had been close to the talks between 
aziz and the un chief said saturday the two men were close to a 
plan that would edge the middle east back from the brink of war 
it mainly called for setting up a buffer between the iraqis and 
the multinational troops in saudi arabia to be manned by an arab 
peacekeeping force 
under the plan the iraqis would free all foreign nationals 
still held in occupied kuwait and iraq the final step would be a 
simultaneous withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait and the 
multinational forces in saudi arabia 
but it appeared a lastminute hitch undermined the plan 
perez de cuellar did not refer directly to the plan but his 
repeated references to iraqs inflexibility indicated he had 
failed to win a pledge from the iraqis to relinquish kuwait or at 
least discuss that as an option 
perez de cuellar said aziz reiterated his countrys position 
that the issue of kuwait needed an arab solution away from 
foreign intervention 
but the un chief stressed to aziz the crisis has taken on 
international dimensions and that the global interests and 
principles have to be acknowledged 
perez de cuellar said he welcomed iraqs decision to free 
hundreds of foreign women and children but that he told aziz this 
was not enough 
he said i emphasized that this decision should be followed by 
another that all restrictions on foreigners and their movement 
be lifted 
hundreds of foreign women and children as well as some sick 
americans flew to freedom saturday they were the first of the 
hostages flown out of iraq since baghdad last week said they would 
be allowed to leave 
but thousands more foreigners mostly men are still banned from 
leaving iraq many of them interned at key installations to avert a 
potential us attack 
when iraq invaded kuwait about 21000 westerners including 
3000 americans were caught in both countries

the canadian army took control sunday of the 
highway running through the mohawk territory of kahnesatake ending 
the blockade of the road that began 54 days ago 
on sunday morning about two dozen troops backed by two armored 
personnel carriers moved onto the highway and began approaching the 
main barricade at the top of the oka hill 18 miles west of 
montreal where defiant mohawks have waged an armed standoff with 
government authorities 
when the army moved in sunday morning none of the mohawks made 
a move to stop the troops the soldiers strung barbed wire around 
the main barricade on highway 344 and began to inspect it for mines 
and booby traps 
an army helicopter with guns pointed out its side doors flew 
low overhead 
thank god its over said master cpl daniel dugas as he 
stood on the highway its about time and im happy it happened 
without a shot 
gen armand roy commander of the canadian forces 5th brigade 
said he decided to send in his troops after two mohawk men were 
wounded in factional fighting behind indian barricades set up in a 
land dispute with government officials 
i decided to move my troops so as to guarantee the security of 
civilians and my soldiers roy said 
the military action came after efforts failed to reach a 
negotiated settlement in the dispute the mohawks have been trying 
to block a golf course extension on land they claim is theirs but 
they have also raised other grievances 
on saturday defiant indian militants stood their ground and 
screamed at canadian soldiers to get away as troops pushed to 
within 100 yards of the main barricade saturday afternoon 
the troops moved into an area where the army had estimated at 
least 50 armed members of the militant mohawk warriors society 
were located 
provincial authorities monday had given the military the 
goahead to end the armed standoff that began july 11 when the 
quebec provincial police attempted to storm a mohawk barricade at 
oka one officer was killed but it is still not clear by whose 
gunfire 
later that day fellow mohawks set up a blockade in sympathy at 
the mercier bridge a major link between montreal and its southern 
suburbs 
the ostensible reason for the mohawk uprising expansion of the 
golf course was settled when the federal government purchased the 
land and said it would turn it over to the indians 
but militants seized the situation to publicize a much wider 
range of indian grievances against the government including 
demands for sovereignty 
on friday mohawks from the kanewake reserve south of montreal 
allowed troops to remove the main barricades they had set up on 
routes leading to the mercier bridge quebec transport department 
officials said it would take several days before the bridge can be 
reopened to traffic 
the bridge blockade forced thousands of commuters on the south 
shore of the st lawrence river to make long detours to montreal 
which is on an island angry residents have protested and thrown 
rocks at mohawks

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
possible duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is 
following this small unit of 14 guardsmen as they prepare for 
deployment overseas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when nine seconds were up at least 
five men of the 265th quartermaster detachment were dead a fact 
that did not please some of the casualties 
i was not dead said a petulant sgt ronnie jackson leader 
of 14member national guard unit preparing for deployment to the 
mideast 
but the sergeant instructing the unit in nbc nuclear 
biological chemical warfare explained patiently that jacksons 
gas mask straps were still tangled nine seconds after she shouted 
go if this had been a nerve gas attack he still wouldnt be 
struggling to get the mask on or have any breath left to argue 
ernie deloach the stocky corrections guard who is another of 
the units sergeants took the side of the instructor 
if you start twitching ill have to shoot you and take 
command he told jackson muffled laughter came from the circle 
of hooded guardsmen standing in the light georgia rain thunder 
from the storm boomed in the distance 
chemical warfare exercises are not new to the 265th a water 
purification unit activated for duty in the persian gulf many of 
the men have two decades in the south carolina national guard they 
trained yearly with gas masks and bulky chemical suits 
but never before has this practice had such a sharp edge of 
reality the men are likely to go to a place where chemical warfare 
is no drill 
no one took this stuff seriously before now now everyone is 
scared said sgt iris craig the units instructor 
the sergeant is an intense teacher who rewards students with a 
withering stare when they give an outoftheballpark answer to her 
questions 
you need to wake up people she said at one slow point in 
class if you could not effectively identify a chemical agent 
you could become a casualty 
but there is a lot to remember or compute as craig keeps 
saying its hard to keep it all straight theres vx ga gb gd 
blood agents blister agents persistent and nonpersistent gases 
is it ga that has a fruity odor and ac that smells like bitter 
almonds or is it the other way around 
it is a challenge with your head pounding inside the gas mask 
to follow the 14 steps on your indexcardsize m256 detector kit 
and chose between the pastel blues and purples of the color chart 
to see if youve been exposed to mustard or phosgene 
theres no way were going to remember it all said spc 
willie badger a 34yearold electrician im just trying to 
remember the important stuff 
a member of the 265th for nine years badger is affectionately 
known as bonehead to other unit members after his shining pate 
badger shaves his head each time he goes off on national guard 
deployment 
his friends also tease him about his snoring wondering out loud 
if his wife finally is getting a good nights sleep now that he has 
been called up 
we mess around a lot but when it comes to doing the job 
were all business he said 
badger spends his time in line outside the mess hall reading his 
pocket bible he comes from a devout family his mother wanted him 
to be a preacher but badger confesses he is considered the 
backslider of the family because he drinks and smokes 
dont worry calls one his buddies alcohol isnt allowed in 
saudi arabia 
my mom said she hopes when i come back ill try preaching but 
i dont think so he said with a grin

president bush is getting conflicting advice 
on whether he should or even could strike against iraq fast 
before the extraordinary coalition of nations that confronts saddam 
hussein unravels 
but the military is cautioning against it pentagon officials 
say privately that the american buildup in saudi arabia is weeks 
away from being ready for warfare especially ground combat 
absolutely not a military source said when asked last week 
about the possibility of an offensive operation were just not 
ready yet we dont have enough force on the ground 
administration officials say there is some pressure from within 
congress and from abroad to attack even without a provocative act 
from saddam whose forces have pulled back from the 
catandmouse air and sea taunts of a few days ago 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity conceded that 
if too much time passes the coalition against saddam particularly 
in the arab world could fragment at home he acknowledged 
public support might drain away in the face of a stalemate 
for the time being bush seems willing to wait to see if he can 
strangle saddam into submission through a worldwide blockade of 
iraq 
the basic pieces of our policy are in place he told a news 
conference thursday 
so officials say it is unlikely he will launch an unprovoked 
attack the white house believes saddam is on the run one official 
said 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk characterized as 
uninformed speculation reports of pressure on the 
administration for a military move 
we have a strategy in place based on the united nations 
resolution and the unpassed sanctions he said 
one official cited intelligence reports that saddam is trying 
to use oil as a bargaining chip to underscore the administration 
portrait of the iraqi president as an increasingly desperate man 
he said saddam was trying to barter oil for sugar and other 
commodities such overtures have been made to turkey the 
philippines and elsewhere he said 
also arguing against a quickstrike strategy one powerful 
enough presumably to remove iraq as a threat to western interests 
for years to come is the situation on the ground 
us forces are just beginning to assume defensive positions and 
need more training in the hostile desert environment thousands 
more troops are on the way to bolster the more than 60000 us 
military personnel already in the gulf region 
allied arab forces are even less combat ready and the saudi 
troops that constitute a border tripwire defense are poorly 
prepared to cope with gas warfare or an onslaught of powerful 
iraqi tanks 
on friday army gen h norman schwarzkopf the commander of 
us forces in the middle east said flatly theres not going to 
be any war unless the iraqis attack 
if saddam hussein launched an attack wed respond because 
wed have to schwarzkopf said but we just dont have enough 
armor on the ground yet to launch any kind of offensive 
a usinitiated attack would change the political configuration 
and upset the antisaddam alliance bush has pieced together 
analysts caution 
the arab world could easily become united behind saddam and 
against the united states if bush is seen as having used iraqs 
takeover of kuwait as an excuse to establish a permanent american 
presence in the mideast 
the soviet union would be uneasy about a major us military 
advance in the middle east a subject bush is likely to discuss 
with soviet president mikhail gorbachev on sunday in helsinki 
finland 
as it is the leaders of jordan and egypt must worry about 
saddams popularity among the masses 
saddam has tried to capitalize on public discontent in the 
poorer arab countries by picturing israel as the hidden villain in 
the gulf crisis and denouncing saudi arabias royal rulers for 
allowing infidel americans to despoil the site of islams 
holiest places 
but american military officials in saudi arabia who spoke on 
grounds they wouldnt be quoted by name said that if the united 
states were intent on striking first it could have used its air 
power to punish the iraqi army in the first days of the invasion 
before saddam had time to amass a huge force near the saudi border 
some saudi officials say that if fighting breaks out it will be 
because saddam initiates it or is goaded into taking a 
provocative act 
and at the pentagon a senior official contended theres no 
firststrike sentiment in the top military ranks 
they do the planning he said of the military chiefs they 
know whats required but contrary to popular belief they are not 
the ones who are pushing for going into combat they know what war 
involves and they know its costs i call it a warwariness on 
their part

a letter of thanks for the gift of a uniform and 
blankets said to have been written by general robert e lee is on 
auction 
the letter is dated april 22 1864 a year before the american 
civil war ended with lees surrender at appomattox 
it was sent from the confederate leaders headquarters to a 
major lb ferguson in england who apparently was a regular 
supporter of the general 
i have often wished to thank you for the kind sentiment and 
high appreciation of the army of north virginia the letter says 
it acknowledges the uniforms and blankets you so kindly sent 
me and adds i beg you will not add to your troubles by 
administering to my comfort we have partly owing to your efforts 
and partly to the exertions of our people everything we actually 
want all else we can dispense with 
auctioneer michael shortall said sunday the style of the 
prose is very much the style of an 18thcentury english gentleman 
a nice little vignette of lee at the end of his career 
he said he was studying british army records to establish who 
maj lb ferguson was 
the letter is among the contents of heronden hall in kent county 
which are being auctioned on sept 10

pope john paul ii on sunday urged 
cooperation and brotherhood between christianity and islam two 
religions with ancient rivalries in africa 
religious differences of themselves do not necessarily disrupt 
life together the pope told leaders of the moslem and other 
faiths in this east african nation 
john paul said dialogue between christians and moslems is 
increasingly important in todays world 
christians and moslems can live in harmony and show their 
solidarity with one another in all the joys sorrows and 
challenges of life the pope said 
christians and moslems in tanzania can be partners in building 
a society shaped by the values taught by god tolerance justice 
peace and concern for the poorest and weakest 
roman catholicism and islam the worlds two largest religions 
have occasionally clashed in competition for converts in africa 
the vatican has expressed concern about the spread of moslem 
fundamentalism in parts of the continent 
in an earlier speech to catholic bishops sunday john paul 
referred to those problems when he said the clergy needed to 
involve the laity more deeply in the church to avoid the 
proselytizing pressures from other faiths or religious groups 
the vatican has also suggested that the moslem faith is not 
interested in dialogue and cooperation but the pope hailed good 
relations between the two faiths in tanzania a largely moslem 
country where catholics make up only 21 percent of the population 
of 75 million 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the moslem community 
contributed financially to the papal visit the nations moslem 
president ali hassan mwinyi and a number of other prominent 
members of the faith attended the popes openair mass earlier 
sunday 
noting that both religions are deeply committed to the spread 
of their respective faiths the pope said they nonetheless could 
build a firm foundation of collaboration and mutual respect 
that foundation he said should be recognition that every 
person has an inalienable right and a solemn duty to follow his or 
her upright conscience 
the lord of heaven and earth cannot be pleased with a 
religious observance that is somehow imposed from without john 
paul said 
what would then become of the wonderful gifts of reason and 
free will 
the pope celebrated mass in a huge outdoor arena built primarily 
for political functions on the outskirts of dar es salaam up to 
100000 people gathered for the ceremony at which the pope 
ordained 43 priests 
in his homily he urged the new priests to maintain their vows 
of celebacy a major challenge for the church particularly in 
africa where native tradition places great stress on fatherhood 
the pope spoke in english but laced his homily with phrases of 
swahili the lingua franca of east africa drawing cheers and 
ululation from the crowd 
a clapping swaying drumbeating womens choir dressed in 
wraparound skirts and tshirts bearing the popes likeness 
provided hours of rythmic native hymns in swahili 
sunday was the second day of the popes seventh visit to africa 
a 10day trip that will take him next to three other tanzanian 
cities then to burundi rwanda and the west coast nation of ivory 
coast 
he ends the trip there sept 10 with a consecration of a massive 
basilica

for all the fears and dangers it has raised 
the persian gulf crisis has produced a shift in views of the middle 
east that is welcome to israels rightwing government 
until iraqi troops swept into kuwait on aug 2 the world tended 
to ignore israels persistent warnings that president saddam 
husseins thirst for power was a serious danger to the whole world 
not just to israel 
the outside world seemed to focus on the palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation and the efforts of prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs government to put it down with bullets and 
beatings 
young stonethrowers were dying daily plo chairman yasser 
arafat talked of compromise and israel refused to talk to 
palestinians 
all that changed with iraqs invasion of kuwait defense 
minister moshe arens expressed the satisfaction of the government 
when he said shortly after the invasion 
i dont want to say i told you so but i told you so 
saddams invasion and annexation of kuwait shifted attention 
from the palestinian problem toward the broader question of 
israeliarab relations 
yossi olmert director of the government press office and a 
member of shamirs conservative likud bloc says iraqs military 
sweep proved that saddam and not the palestinianisraeli conflict 
posed a danger to world order 
the palestinian uprising did not set off a global crisis it 
was an israeli crisis olmert told the associated press 
iraqkuwait is a global crisis 
iraqs invasion and the strong western reaction also have 
produced several other changes pleasing to israel 
angry statements from the united states about israeli 
footdragging on the middle east peace process have been replaced 
by public thanks for israels restraint in the crisis 
it is now arafat and palestinians who face world criticism for 
their praise and support of saddam as a strong arab leader 
concern by both arabs and european governments that a flood of 
soviet jewish immigrants could move into the occupied territories 
has been suspended the influx reached a monthly record of 16000 
in august 
despite those changes there are nagging fears that the gulf 
crisis could produce terrible results for the jewish state 
in israel there is worry that iraq could make good on its 
threat to attack with chemical weapons and there is a possibility 
that even a political settlement could be bad for the jewish state 
unless saddam is swept from power 
arens told israel television last week if he stays at his 
post and would still possess the weapons there will be a place for 
worry in our country in the whole region and i think the whole 
world 
despite the rush of events some israelis also point out that 
the issue of 17 million palestinians in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip is not simply going to go away 
it is best that extremists in the nationalist camp do 
not rejoice yet cautioned an editorial in the hebrew daily 
haaretz the new relations being woven between the united states 
and some arab nations will soon be felt 
political analysts in and out of the government believe that 
egypt syria and other arab nations supporting us efforts against 
saddam may unite behind the palestinian cause when the gulf crisis 
is resolved 
fears have been raised that a successful us campaign to end 
iraqs occupation of kuwait will raise troublesome questions about 
israels 23year occupation of the west bank and gaza 
already 728 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians since the revolt began in december 1987 an additional 
254 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs most as suspected 
collaborators fortyseven israelis also have been killed 
even the rightwing government knows it cannot simply forget the 
palestinian question 
still worries about the longterm impact of the gulf crisis 
cannot suppress the upbeat mood among officials and many in the 
israeli public 
for once if only for the moment israelis seem to have reached 
some sort of political consensus in the face of iraqs invasion 
even yossi sarid a leader of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement that has advocated talking to the plo and giving up 
occupied land wrote a column questioning his partys past stance 
you need to put on a gas mask to protect yourself against the 
poisonous smell of the prosaddam stand of the palestine liberation 
organization sarid said

american families wait fretful and helpless while loved ones 
are held captive by a middle east leader to dorothea morefield 
their emotions are chillingly familiar 
more than anything else there is a feeling of your life being 
out of control she said recalling her husbands captivity in 
iran a decade ago someone that you love is in danger and there 
is nothing you can do 
today the frustration belongs to relatives of the more than 
2000 us citizens trapped since iraqi president saddam husseins 
troops invaded kuwait on aug 2 
its a waiting game familiar to the families of americans seized 
in tehran on nov 4 1979 by ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
revolutionaries fiftytwo hostages endured 444 days in captivity 
when the iranian hostages finally came home to parades and 
cheering throngs they called their families the true heroes their 
loved ones had been brave resourceful and resolute most of all 
they had carried on 
knowing that my family was strong not having to worry about 
how they were going to cope i could be concerned about hanging on 
myself said richard morefield former consulgeneral in tehran 
in tehran the hostages were the issue in iraq and kuwait they 
are the scattered byproduct of saddams invasion iran did not face 
an international military response and economic blockade 
in 1979 the embassy hostages were diplomats and servicemen 
todays captives are mostly civilians 
but if the scenarios differ the coping is the same 
mrs morefield couldnt free her husband but she could still 
carry on for him so as the days turned into weeks she gathered 
her five children and together they substituted pragmatism for 
panic 
they drew up lists of state department and other contacts 
canceled credit cards and closed joint bank accounts after tying 
up those loose ends family members concentrated on keeping their 
hands busy and their minds occupied 
mrs morefield scrubbed floors knitted afghans and took walks 
her children continued with their studies sports and other hobbies 
its very important that you get on with your life that you 
dont stagnate said mrs morefield who now lives with her 
husband in annandale va you keep control of your life as much 
as you can 
its hard for relatives to avoid wild imaginings the veterans 
of the iran ordeal said 
the hostages know their living conditions they know how 
theyre being treated and if theyre being fed said kevin 
hermening who was a marine guard in tehran when the embassy was 
seized their families do not 
his mother was criticized for visiting the hostages during their 
captivity but hermening understands her desperation 
its hardest on the families of hostages because they have 
only speculation said hermening a new father and candidate for 
the wisconsin legislature they dont know what their loved ones 
are going through 
as the persian gulf crisis enters its second month the families 
of those trapped overseas are in much the same situation in many 
cases they can only guess the whereabouts of relatives many of 
whom have been out of contact for weeks 
when youre out there you know where the walls are said 
former hostage bruce laingen who was charge daffaires and the top 
us diplomat in iran 
when youre back here youre constantly dealing with not 
knowing enough said laingen now executive director of the 
national commission on the public service youre never happy 
never satisfied im sure thats true among many of the families 
today 
but former hostages and their families warned against letting 
the frustration run rampant dignity is the thing they said 
too much wringing of hands is not good for the national 
morale said moorhead kennedy who was the thirdranking foreign 
service officer at the us embassy in tehran stand up remember 
who you are 
his wife louisa did just that in the darkest days of the iran 
hostage crisis she went to work on a network for the victims 
families 
we considered ourselves hostages said mrs kennedy who was 
spokeswoman for the family liaison action group in washington in 
my case i resolved that in some degree by putting myself to work 
its very important for families to see this in context see 
that it isnt some wicked thing thats just happening to them 
added kennedy who works at the american forum for global education 
in new york 
hostage families have to step back try to see the bigger 
picture said those who have been through it and survived 
its important for the family to remember that their relatives 
will be well said former diplomat barry rosen who is now an 
assistant vice president at brooklyn college in new york 
theres nothing like freedom like being able to open the door 
and walk outside he said that cures a lot of ills 
and families should never abandon hope former hostages said 
the door to freedom could soon swing open 
you never know what the next day will bring rosen said

former convenience store cashiers who 
say they were coerced into falsely confessing to thefts and 
repaying money they never stole are taking their battle from the 
courtroom to the sidewalks 
just sitting around talking about what happened only makes you 
madder said kenneth provost of chicopee who with other former 
employees launched a picket saturday of two cumberland farms stores 
in the chains home state of massachusetts 
they are not alone in their anger 
despite the companys repeated denials of any wrongdoing more 
than 300 former workers have approached lawyers handling a federal 
lawsuit against the company saying they also were forced to sign 
false confessions 
the suit originally filed by 12 employees four years ago is 
scheduled to go to trial in camden nj in december 
within the past few weeks former workers in at least three 
states have created support groups and the prosecutors office in 
orlando fla says it will no longer routinely process theft 
claims filed by the company against workers 
many of those that have come forward said they paid hundreds and 
sometimes thousands of dollars to the company to avoid prosecution 
and the humiliation of a public accusation of theft 
the reaction has been unbelievable provost said every 
day more people come in and say it happened to me too 
in july the philadelphia inquirer reported that during the 
first six months of 1986 cumberland farms security officials 
obtained confessions from 57 percent of the 2600 cashiers they 
questioned about theft and collected 368000 from the workers 
and frederic j gross the attorney handling the federal suit 
claims that over the past 20 years as many as 30000 people who 
worked for the chain may have been accused of stealing the 
estimate was based on internal report cards maintained by the 
company on the security staff some of which have been obtained by 
the lawyers gross said 
foster g macrides a vice president and chief spokesman for 
cumberland farms did not return telephone messages left at the 
companys headquarters in the boston suburb of canton 
but he has said repeatedly that the 50yearold chain which 
operates 1100 stores in new england new york pennsylvania 
delaware new jersey florida and ohio has never and will never 
have a policy of coercing or intimidating our employees 
one woman who had signed a confession as a teenager told 
lawyers that for 15 years her father refused to believe her claims 
of innocence but now she was stepping forward at his urging 
others said they had signed confessions as teenagers in hopes 
of keeping the accusation from their parents or were simply scared 
into signing 
i was sobbing and crying so hard when they threatened to put 
me in jail and take away my children that i threw up said 
margaret stone of bennington vt a divorced mother of six who was 
working at a new hampshire store last year when she was accused of 
stealing 6000 
she said store officials told her if she signed a false 
confession and came up with 1500 in cash by noon the next day 
they would not have her jailed and her children would not be taken 
away 
they even brought me out to the pay phone in the parking lot 
at 1130 at night and made me call my parents for the money she 
said it was so cold and i was crying so hard that the security 
man took the phone from me and talked to my mother 
it was the worst nightmare of my life 
there are all these little tragedies out there and its so 
damn unnecessary said k kay shearin a delaware lawyer 
shirley disalvo one of ms shearins clients was arrested by 
delaware state police and jailed for four days last month even 
though she was nine months pregnant after a computer check 
uncovered a 4yearold warrant dating back to her brief stint as a 
clerk in a florida store 
cumberland farms accused her of stealing 2900 after the woman 
then 18 told store officials she had taken an unauthorized soft 
drink on a half dozen occasions when she worked overtime according 
to ms shearin 
provost said his support group recently began picketing because 
we wanted to do something to get the attention of other people 
that were victimized and thought they were alone 
but sometimes just talking to someone who has been in the same 
straits helps said grettel dunn who started a support group in 
rhode island 
i thought i was the only one it had ever happened to and i was 
so ashamed said mrs dunn i never took anything in my life 
mrs dunn said she refused to sign a confession when she was 
called into the back room sat down on a milk carton and told she 
could not leave but she said she was in tears when she finally 
plucked up the courage to walk out amid shouted warnings that 
police would be waiting at her door 
needless to say they were not she said

indefinite curfew in mullaitivu vavunia and mannar predominately 
tamil districts in the north

the president of cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government appearing to reject key features 
of a new un peace plan said his government wants to maintain the 
political and military status quo 
the us assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific 
affairs richard solomon said sunday that vietnam had similar 
reservations in talks with the united states last week 
cambodian president heng samrins comments came in a speech 
broadcast by the state radio saturday the text was seen sunday in 
bangkok 
he said his government regarded the un plan as a basic 
document for future discussions and was ready to discuss it with 
the guerrillas in talks indonesia is arranging 
but he said with no elaboration that his governments stance 
is to maintain its status quo both politically and military 
the un role he said should include verifying that agreements 
are implemented and organizing the election his remarks on the 
un role were not completely monitored due to reception problems 
the plan was adopted tuesday by the united states and the other 
permanent members of the security council china the soviet 
union britain and france 
the three rebel groups fighting the government have expressed 
support for the plan washington backs two of the guerrilla groups 
on friday cambodias deputy prime minister in charge of foreign 
affairs hor nam hong said the phonm penh government accepted a 
major un role including its supervision of certain key 
ministries but he gave no indication cambodia was yielding on its 
desire for interim authority 
they proposed that the united nations supervise and if 
necessary control five key government ministries in the 
transitional period before elections they also want the armies of 
the vietnameseinstalled phnom penh government and the three 
guerrilla groups disarmed and regrouped into supervised cantonments 
the four cambodian factions would form a supreme national 
council as a figurehead government 
the cambodian president in the saturday broadcast called the 
supreme national council only the symbol of national independence 
and sovereignty 
the most urgent question is the first meeting of the supreme 
national council so as to enable the voluntary ceasefire to go 
into effect heng samrin said 
the guerrillas want either the council or the united nations as 
the interim government 
an attempt to form the council in june collapsed when the 
strongest guerrilla group the khmer rouge opposed the allocation 
of seats on the council as unfair to it the final formation of the 
council is to be a major aim of proposed talks in indonesia 
sovietsupported vietnam installed heng samrins communist 
government after invading cambodia in late 1978 ending a nearly 
fouryear khmer rouge reign in which hundreds of thousands of 
people were killed in slave labor camps and execution chambers 
the khmer rouge supported by china now is allied with two 
noncommunist groups in the guerrilla coalition the usbacked 
forces of prince norodom sihanouk and of son sanns khmer peoples 
national liberation front 
vietnam voiced its reservations with the un plan at a meeting 
at the united nations friday in which the united states tried to 
persuade them to back the plan solomon said 
the vietnamese he said voiced reservations on issues related 
to military arrangements and some of the administrative 
arrangements 
solomon would not go into detail but when asked if that meant 
vietnam still wanted the armies to remain in place and phnom penh 
to hold interim authority he replied 
yes my impression is that if they had their own wish that is 
probably the case 
solomon was in bangkok for talks on economic issues with 
thailand and its five allies in the association of southeast asian 
nations

church services were held quietly 
for american soldiers sunday despite this countrys ban on the 
practice of religions other than islam 
the services conducted by chaplains from all military branches 
were held in mess halls tents and in big warehouses soldiers said 
they were well attended 
there are no atheists in foxholes said capt ba arnold 
an air force chaplain from cannon air force of clovis nm the 
pressures of the military tend to force people to ask questions 
about the meaning of life and death 
the military has gone to great lengths not to draw attention to 
the services notices of times and places are sometimes posted 
discreetly on bulletin boards other services are advertised by 
word of mouth 
the military is not alone in circumventing the ban the western 
community holds a christian service on fridays the traditional 
day off in saudi arabia the oil company saudi aramco which has 
thousands of foreign employees also has christian services on its 
private compound 
us officials said they do not want to offend the saudis we 
do respect the laws of the host country one pentagon official 
said 
the rule of thumb is dont flaunt it dont try to convert 
the moslems arnold said 
some americans said they were advised not to bring bibles to 
saudi arabia or to hand out religious literature but many people 
carry bibles with them and religious literature is handed out 
among marines 
a saudi official said his government is prepared to let people 
worship as long as they are discreet the us troops are kept 
isolated from the saudi society 
pentagon officials said the religious needs of more than 60000 
military troops deployed here will be met regardless of whether 
they are christian jewish or moslem 
the 82nd airborne from fort bragg nc for instance scheduled 
nine services at its desert headquarters sunday all were for 
catholics or protestants with the exception of one mormon service 
officially there is no religion allowed or practiced in saudi 
arabia other than islam said jonathan rice a us consulate 
spokesman 
americans said the potentially dangerous military situation 
combined with loneliness and physical hardships have caused them to 
find solace in religion 
army pvt preston suminguit says he goes to church every 
chance i get the 20yearold cleveland paratrooper pulled from 
the pockets of his fatigues three things he carries with him at all 
times a book of psalms and proverbs from the new testament the 
paratroopers faith a collection of religious teachings and 
the liner to his fathers green beret 
airman ty worthington 21 of base city mich said the 
practice of religion is sometimes kept out of sight 
the chaplains sometimes dont tell the troops about impromptu 
services until the last minute he said the services are unseen 
unheard sometimes in the back of a supply warehouse 
even though the locals dont like us practicing our 
religion worthington said faith plays a big role in the lives of 
many men and women 
the chaplains do a lot of oneonone work they handout mail 
give out cookies and offer a few words of encouragement 
i havent met a paratrooper who is an atheist said sgt 
derrick white of patterson nj when you are jumping from an 
aircraft at 2000 feet you believe in god

the nations fifthlargest city is running 
out of cash 
without a 400 million emergency loan philadelphia will be out 
of money by the end of the month the mayor wants the loan the 
city controller says he wont sign it 
but even with the cash flow help the city will still be 2064 
million in the red on a budget of 21 billion and projections 
indicate more deficits in years to come unless drastic steps are 
taken some are even advocating a state takeover like the one that 
bailed out new york city 15 years ago 
controller jonathan a saidel cant block the emergency loan by 
withholding his signature but he can make it harder for a city 
whose notes are already rated as shaky by wall street 
i believe it is not in the best interest of the city of 
philadelphia saidel explains 
on friday gov robert p casey said an unidentified japanese 
bank had offered the city a 225 million letter of credit to help 
philadelphia sell temporary loan notes 
officially mayor w wilson goode has put the loan on hold for a 
couple of weeks to try to sort things out 
saidel said the loan wont cure the debacles that created the 
crunch such as the 25 million bill to rebuild a neighborhood 
bombed by city police in the 1985 confrontation with the radical 
group move or another 25 million the courts ordered returned to 
property taxpayers as illegally collected cash nor he said will 
it force the mayor and city council to work together or the state 
to chip in 
goode blames the crisis on the city council for blocking his 
efforts now and in the past the state legislature for refusing to 
allow a local sales tax this year and the federal government for 
years of decreasing aid 
he made a televised appeal last month for more state aid and 
council cooperation in raising unspecified existing taxes 150 
million and cutting unspecified nonessential city services 
without those steps despite the 400 million loan the city will 
run out of cash next may 
the mayors approach is not new for three years the council 
has diluted or rejected his calls for more taxes and the state has 
rebuffed many of his requests for more aid 
some think this time will be different 
the problem is so real so pressing that no one is going to be 
able to avoid it said sandra featherman director of the center 
for public policy at temple university 
others think the mayor and council will reach their usual 
stalemate and look to an outside group to rescue the city 
more and more theres a belief especially in the business 
community that there has to be an outside entity that there has 
to be credibility established said g terry madonna director of 
the center for politics and public affairs at millersville 
university 
on television goode said he would name an advisory panel to 
devise hardhitting solutions but it would have no authority 
to act 
backers of outside control point to the successful state and 
federal rescue of new york city which in 1975 was broke and 792 
million in debt 
the new york legislature established the municipal assistance 
corp to monitor the city budget and sell bonds on its behalf an 
emergency financial control board was later given control of the 
citys spending and eventually won the confidence of lending 
institutions the federal government backed up 23 billion in city 
borrowing 
philadelphia officials have so far brushed off the idea 
unwilling to surrender control as for state officials featherman 
said im not sure the state wants the problem of managing 
philadelphias debt 
madonna said getting more state aid wont be easy especially in 
an election year 
theres the perception that the city gets more than its share 
of state aid of having to fund the excesses of the city that the 
goode administration has been less than competent he said 
further until there is a workable plan backed by goode and the 
council aiding philadelphia will be perceived as throwing money 
down a rat hole

house majority leader richard 
gephardt said sunday that a lengthy us military presence in saudi 
arabia might strain the american publics patience but that time 
will be a worse enemy to saddam huseein 
the missouri democrat led a 22member congressional delegation 
in a visit to american troops a visit that was shortened when a 
c130 hercules transport plane developed mechanical trouble 
the breakdown details of which were not immediately available 
forced the delegation to cancel one planned trip to a marine camp 
in the northeast saudi desert 
in a brief session with reporters before heading out to see the 
troops gephardt said there would be limits to our patience 
back home if the deployment dragged on 
but with iraq facing world condemnation for its invasion of 
kuwait and economic sanctions that have forced food rationing in 
iraq gephardt suggested the united states had more time than 
saddam 
theres a patience problem on the iraqi side as well said 
gephardt its the world against him its not the world against 
us 
for now gephardt said of the mood back home ive never seen 
stronger support for a military operation since ive been in 
congress he was first elected to the house in 1976 
the commander of us forces in the middle east gen h norman 
schwarzkopf also cited the rationing as evidence the embargo was 
taking its toll on baghdad 
during all eight years of the iraniraq war they never went to 
rationing schwarzkopf said 
gephardt said a briefing by schwarzkopf convinced him the united 
states has a formidable deterrent force in place 
but he said the united states was still in a waiting game as 
the remainder of its deployment headed for the middle east in what 
is becoming a familiar chorus from members of congress gephardt 
called on other nations to join the multinational defense force 
weve got to convince some of the other nations that theyve 
got to come in he said 
some us allies outside the region have sent warships 
minesweepers and fighter jets and some arab countries have 
deployed troops 
the delegation met with the 1st tactical fighter wing which 
brought dozens of f15s from the united states to saudi arabia and 
then members of the 101st airborne divisions airassault brigade 
the chief complaint from the troops was a poor mail system 
there sure are a lot of bugs to be worked out pvt edward 
humelhans of suring wis told rep david obey a democrat from 
the same state 
other congressional delegations have visited the troops in the 
saudi desert in recent days senate foreign relations committee 
chairman claiborne pell led one over the weekend and eight senators 
came earlier last week

the director of the states permanent 
commission on the status of women has come forward to tell her 
story of being raped two years ago saying in a detailed newspaper 
account that she spoke out because rape is a crime of silence 
i want people to understand it i want people to understand 
that its an act of violence and i want people to know that it 
doesnt have a damn thing to do with sex fredrica gray said in 
an interview with the hartford courant published sunday 
gray the executive director of the commission was sexually 
assaulted on feb 3 1988 in her home in bloomfield a hartford 
suburb she said she convinced her attacker that she had aids a 
lie and lured him back to her house telling him she had medicine 
to treat the condition 
when the man returned he was arrested the man johnny b 
williams of hartford pleaded nocontest and was sentenced earlier 
this year to 13 years in prison 
for every johnny there are a million other ones other men 
who commit these crimes and a lot of them are never caught gray 
said 
gray 44 said she hoped her account would focus more attention 
on violence against women and encourage more victims of sexual 
assalt to report such crimes 
in publishing grays story the courant broke with its policy of 
not printing the names of rape victims while most newspapers have 
similar policies the issue has been debated in journalistic 
circles recently especially after the des moines iowa register 
printed stories earlier this year naming a woman who came forward 
with the story of her 1989 rape 
as a womens rights activist gray had previously helped write a 
booklet on procedures for gathering evidence in rape cases at the 
time of the attack she was preparing for hearings on new statewide 
procedures for dealing with rape victims 
still she said the attack left her devastated even after 
williams arrest she received mail from him at one point she 
said he sent her extremely gross pornography in another 
letter he wrote i love you very much i want to come home 
she said 
it was like being assaulted again and again she said 
she sold her house 16 months after the attack 
i never could sleep there again she said theres 
something that happens about the place you live the place in which 
you are assaulted you cant live there you cant feel safe there 
it retraumatizes you every time you walk through the door 
gray caught her attacker through an elaborate lie she told him 
during the attack which occurred when she was home sick from her 
work at the commission 
i said to him you know why im home i have aids if you 
dont believe me theres medicine on my dresser she said 
when the attacker asked if he could call her later gray said 
she gave him a false name and her real phone number 
i wanted him to call the house she said because i knew 
that if i could get him to call me that we would have a pretty good 
chance of apprehending him 
the day after the assault gray waited with a police detective 
and the attacker called again to lure him back to the house for 
medicine she told him you may have raped me but im going to 
live and youre going to die 
williams then 22 was arrested soon after he entered the house

an environmental group said sunday the 
government should gradually halt the use of many cancercausing 
chemicals on food because it cannot measure how many of the 
substances a person may consume 
in a report the nongovernmental us public interest research 
group said that as many as 60 cancercausing pesticides can legally 
used on the most commonly eaten foods under environmental 
protection agency rules 
but the epa does not adequately account for the accumulated 
exposure to such pesticides through consumption of various foods 
the report said critics also maintain that some levels are based 
on outdated health and medical information 
rather than ban a chemical the epa uses the inexact science 
of risk assessment to set very politicized standards for 
carcinogens and declares the risks negligible said the report 
an epa spokesman al heier said that the report reflected 
nothing new and that the agency three years ago published a list of 
cancercausing chemicals in foods he said that the epa is 
reviewing the status of scores of such chemicals that are used as 
long as residue levels remain within specific limits 
rick tinsworth director of the epas review efforts said the 
direction in which the epa is going parallels what they the 
environmentalists are suggesting he said the epa hopes by 1997 
to have reviewed the status of some 400 pesticides and determine 
whether they should remain in use 
the pirg report documents to what extent cancercausing 
pesticides are being used on a variety of commonly eaten foods from 
beef and pork to vegetables and dairy products 
ten of these commonly eaten foods surveyed are allowed to 
contain 20 or more of these carcinogens said the report it 
noted that 32 different types of cancercausing pesticides can be 
used on beef 30 types on pork and 20 or more types on poultry 
peaches grapes eggs tomatoes apples milk and corn 
the report acknowledged that a farmer would not use all of these 
pesticides on a single crop perhaps choosing one or a combination 
of several instead 
the point is that if it did occur it would be legal wrote 
rick hind us pirgs environmental director in the report 
hind said the correct answer to protecting health is the 
systematic and orderly phaseout of the cancercausing 
chemicals he noted some supermarkets already have suggested a 
phaseout the report suggested that the most menacing of the 
cancercausing pesticides be banned over the next eight years 
so far it noted the epa has banned only 11 pesticides for all 
uses on foods 
the us pirg report also urged that pesticide manufacturers be 
required to develop better monitoring procedures and that the 
companies be required to prove that a chemical is safe instead of 
the government proving it unsafe for it to remain on the market 
it noted that farm legislation before congress would require 
farmers to keep records of their pesticide use and would ban the 
export of pesticides prohibited for domestic use there are 
numerous cases where imported foods contain pesticides that are not 
allowed on foods produced in this country according to various 
recent studies

bob smiths critics paint him as a 
pedestrian congressman who would make a lackluster senator but the 
threeterm republican is seen as the man to beat for new 
hampshires open us senate seat 
smith is a staunch conservative whos sometimes set himself at 
odds with party leaders most notably in fighting congressional 
pay raises 
he brushes aside criticism of his track record in the house 
you focus on your principles and stick to them says smith 
49 otherwise why serve 
the senate seat will open up because republican gordon humphrey 
is leaving after two terms fulfilling his pledge not to make 
congress a career it is one of only three open senate seats that 
will be filled in the 1990 elections 
national gop leaders want to keep the seat in republican hands 
even at the price of creating friction within the party 
a whos who of new hampshires gop faithful including white 
house chief of staff and former gov john sununu has lined up 
behind smith in the fourway republican primary on sept 11 
vice president dan quayle in may appeared at a smith fundraiser 
in washington as pleas for neutrality from one of the congressmans 
gop rivals 42yearold lawyer thomas christo when unheeded 
the kind of person who puts a lot of stock in the party 
hierarchy and the status quo is not going to be with me christo 
said 
also vying for the gop nomination are engineering professor ted 
de winter 57 and businessman ewing smith 68 
smith holds an ultraconservative voting record on spending 
issues and says hed continue to fight for a balancedbudget 
amendment and elimination of the federal budget deficit if elected 
to the senate 
everybody accuses me of being too simplistic on this but 
there is nothing complicated about it at all you have to agree in 
principle to balance the budget he said 
some rivals say smiths consistent support for military spending 
belies his claim to be a skinflint 
smiths america is a land in which hundreds of billions are 
spent on star wars while the homeless live in cardboard boxes 
senior citizens fear cutbacks in social security and americas 
children must go without school lunches said democrat james 
donchess the nashua mayor 
smith says he favors some defense cuts but backs continued 
funding for the strategic defense initiative star wars and the 
b2 bomber 
competing for the democratic nomination are donchess 41 former 
us sen john durkin 54 and millionaire former businessman john 
rauh 58 
the democratic aspirants may have hoped smiths primary rivals 
would bloody him before the general election but theyve been busy 
bruising each other instead 
durkin confronted donchess at a recent news conference then 
followed him to a series of news conferences around the state at 
each stop they called each other names the next day rauh 
denounced their actions 
smith stands alone in the field in his strong opposition to 
abortion a stand his opponents have criticized repeatedly but 
smith recently modified his position saying he would accept 
abortion not only to protect the life of the mother but in cases 
of rape and incest as well 
in an august poll conducted by the university of new hampshire 
for wmurtv in manchester 43 percent of republicans backed smith 
six percent chose christo 2 percent ewing smith and 1 percent 
de winter fortyeight percent were undecided 
among democrats 36 percent backed durkin 18 percent donchess 
9 percent rauh and 37 percent undecided the margin of error was 
5 percentage points 
smith outpolled all three democrats in headtohead matchups by 
comfortable margins in an earlier poll by the becker institute of 
sudbury mass 
only smith and rauh a newcomer to politics declined to abide 
by new hampshires voluntary campaign spending limit of 400000 in 
the primary and a like amount in the general election campaign 
smith said the combined spending of the others in a bid to 
derail him prevents him from sticking to the limit he scoffs at 
rivals claims that his acceptance of political action committee 
money means his vote is for sale 
no pac has ever asked me for my vote and i would not give it 
to them he says

job without being elected and critics paint his twoyear tenure as 
undistinguished but hes heavily favored over 13 democratic and 
republican wouldbe successors 
democrat miller who got the governors job when thengov dick 
bryan jumped to the us senate in 1988 is being challenged by 
five democrats in tuesdays primary all are little known and 
running limited campaigns including one longshot hopeful who 
changed his name to rhinestone cowboy 
the republican ballot is even more crowded there are eight 
candidates led by jim gallaway a relative newcomer to the state 
who says miller has shown a total lack of leadership as acting 
governor 
gallaways campaign got a boost when the marine reserve colonel 
was called up for a brief stint on active duty last month 
gallaway who had served five years on active duty spent a week in 
arlington va working as a logistics coordinator on the gulf 
crisis before returning to the campaign trail 
gallaway has been accused by another gop contender builder 
charlie brown of trying to buy the election with slick television 
ads gallaway has outspent brown by a fourtoone margin none of 
the other republican candidates each a political unknown has 
mounted a major campaign 
a tarrance amp associates poll conducted for the nevada retailers 
association in august looked at the likely matchup in november and 
found miller trouncing gallaway 60 percent to 27 percent with a 4 
percentage point margin of error 
but gallaway a business entrepreneur said his internal polls 
show him gaining an edge on the governor when voters are told 
gallaway favors abortion rights and opposes a statewide payroll tax 
plan while miller is antiabortion and backs the tax 
miller 45 was elected lieutenant governor four years ago after 
serving two terms in las vegas as clark county district attorney 
he takes credit as governor for getting lawmakers to raise 
teachers pay and lower class sizes and creating a state drug 
czar he also has vetoed a controversial pension hike for 
lawmakers supported various tax hikes and opposed abortion 
im optimistic miller said of his election campaign im 
going to run based on my record he said that includes his two 
years as governor as well as his prior service as lieutenant 
governor and in las vegas where he was raised 
gallaway has attacked miller on his abortion and taxation 
stands but the governor so far has avoided direct criticism of 
gallaway and the other candidates 
im busy talking about bob miller the governor said in 
fact from the campaign activity ive seen it looks like both of 
us are going to be talking about me 
miller has collected 11 million in contributions compared with 
gallaways total of about 318000 most of that from his personal 
funds but gallaway said hes hoping for another 1 million and is 
willing to continue pouring his own money into the race 
gallaway said that while he has been in nevada only about two 
years he has strong gop support including backing from the 
republican governors association 
all that miller can show for his tenure is a total lack of 
leadership the only time he acts is in a crisis gallaway said

diplomatic efforts to avert war slipped 
back out of the public eye sunday as un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar voiced deep disappointment that talks with iraq 
reached no accord over kuwait 
i had hoped for a more flexible position regarding the retreat 
from kuwait perez de cuellar said briefing reporters after 
nine hours of talks over two days with iraqi foreign minister tariq 
aziz 
in a prepared statement he concluded the talks were useful 
but disappointing 
later he flew to paris where he was to meet with jordans king 
hussein and french president francois mitterrand the jordanian 
king has traveled to nine countries to gather support for an arab 
peace plan he has yet to crystallize 
in paris perez de cuellar said he was deeply disappointed 
in his talks with aziz because he had expected a certain 
flexibility 
what iraq wants is to stay in kuwait which is unacceptable to 
the international community to the un security council and to 
its secretary general perez de cuellar told reporters after 
meeting french foreign minister roland dumas 
but he said he still held out hope that iraq would become more 
accommodating i am available he said if at any given 
time they wish to modify their position i will be delighted to 
listen to them 
although a summit in helsinki next sunday between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev might open new 
possibilities no other major public talks on the persian gulf 
crisis were scheduled 
perez de cuellar began the highly touted amman meetings friday 
with uncharacteristic optimism matched by upbeat remarks by aziz 
both also reflected a positive attitude between their four sessions 
but a senior jordanian official with access to the talks said 
the meeting broke down over iraqs refusal to budge on the basic 
issue of its domination of kuwait which it seized on aug 2 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said perez de 
cuellar had hoped for some public concession from iraq along with 
its quiet moves beneath the surface 
iraq had many demands and was stubborn the official said 
aziz spent much of his time insisting the united states was 
violating international law 
with hopes dashed for any immediate breakthrough perez de 
cuellar would likely explore various proposals for an arab buffer 
force under an international umbrella the jordanian official said 
the buffer force would separate us and allied troops from 
iraqi troops 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi has suggested his own peace plan 
under which un troops would replace the iraqis in kuwait and arab 
or moslem armies would replace us forces in saudi arabia 
plo chief yasser arafat has proposed a plan that links an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait with an israeli pullout from occupied 
territories egyptian president hosni mubaraks arab league 
approach simply demands that iraq leave kuwait 
perez de cuellar said the crisis had taken on international 
dimensions and global principles have to be acknowledged but 
with international approval he said any arab plan could be 
implemented 
asked about the use of an arab force perez de cuellar told 
reporters i did not discuss this with him 
but jordanian sources said aziz and the un chief discussed a 
plan to put arab troops between iraqi and us forces secure 
release of the hostages and arrange for simultaneous withdrawals in 
kuwait and saudi arabia un members including the soviet union 
might mediate 
but the sources said the longterm political resolution of the 
conflict seemed insurmountable 
iraq has stressed that any solution in kuwait must also settle 
outstanding issues in israelioccupied territories and lebanon 
where syrian troops are deployed 
in the amman talks aziz refused to bend until guarantees were 
made about israel and lebanon the jordanian sources said the 
secretarygeneral as an agent of the united nations had no room 
to maneuver they said

an east german government spokesman said the 
countrys ambassador to kuwait was forcibly taken to iraq on sunday 
after he left his diplomatic mission apparently to seek food at 
the west german embassy 
the east berlin government was negotiating with iraq for the 
release of ambassador kurt merkel 56 a government spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman citing the talks with iraq would give no details 
of the incident however he confirmed a report from brussels 
belgium where a diplomatic source said merkel was taken to baghdad 
from iraqioccupied kuwait 
the source who also spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
information was relayed to brussels by marcel van roey the belgian 
ambassador in kuwait 
the source said the east german envoy left his embassy where 
the food and water situation was apparently critical to visit 
the west german embassy 
after leaving the west german mission saturday afternoon 
merkel accompanied by his wife was questioned by iraqi soldiers 
for several hours the belgian official said 
he spent the night at the east german mission today sunday 
he was taken under escort to baghdad this sounds like an expulsion 
to us added the source 
it was unclear if merkels wife also was taken to baghdad 
a west german foreign ministry spokesman in bonn said he could 
not confirm the report and said the information must come from east 
germany 
merkel has been ambassador to kuwait since april 22 1987 he 
and his wife had been alone at the embassy since the missions 15 
other staffers were evacuated more than a week ago 
iraq has ordered foreign missions to leave kuwait because it 
claims the country is now a part of iraq scores of diplomats 
remain holed up in their embassies 
a west german jet early sunday carried 311 women children and a 
few men from 22 countries to frankfurt from iraq after baghdad said 
it would release women and children among the westerners trapped in 
the country 
iraq is the target of a usled trade embargo that is believed 
to have created shortages of food and other essential supplies 
thousands of us troops were deployed in saudi arabia to deter an 
iraqi attack after the persian gulf nation invaded kuwait on aug 2

three palestinians were killed by israelis in 
august equaling the lowest monthly death toll of the 33month 
palestinian uprising according to figures released sunday 
julys toll was also three 
the israeli center for human rights in the occupied territories 
attributed the lower toll to an army policy of avoiding 
confrontations with stone throwers the policy was initiated by 
defense minister moshe arens who took office in june 
the decrease in the number of palestinians killed by the 
security forces in the territories continues the center said in 
a written statement it can be explained by a more restrained 
policy on opening fire 
of the three palestinians killed in august one victim was shot 
in a clash with soldiers in the occupied west bank 
also an israeli woman has been charged in connection with the 
death of a palestinian during antiarab riots in jerusalem the 
army said an investigation is being conducted into the fatal 
shooting of a palestinian woman in the west bank town of hebron 
the slayings in jerusalem and hebron followed the discovery of 
the bodies of two jewish teenagers in jerusalem believed to be 
slain by palestinian nationalists 
also in august palestinians in the occupied territories killed 
at least 11 fellow arabs on suspicion of collaborating with the 
israeli authorities arab reports said 
at least 728 palestinians have died at the hands of israeli 
soldiers and civilians since the uprising began in december 1987 
the highest toll was in april 1988 when 44 palestinians were 
killed during riots over the death of the palestine liberation 
organizations military commander khalil wazir also known as abu 
jihad he was shot in tunis by unidentified assailants the death 
was blamed on israel 
last may 32 palestinians were killed most as the army sought 
to put down riots following the killings of seven arab workers by 
an apparently deranged israeli civilian 
some 254 palestinians also have been killed by their arab 
brethren as suspected proisraeli collaborators fortyseven 
israelis have died in the violence

police found the bodies of 21 
blacks sunday following overnight clashes in townships wracked by 
fighting among rival black factions 
president fw de klerk meanwhile announced a followup 
investigation into allegations of improper police violence against 
blacks and urged an inquiry into the system of housing migrant 
workers in barracks 
many of the young men in the barracks have taken part in 
township fights in which more than 530 blacks have died since aug 
12 
the battles in tembisa and tokoza east of johannesburg saturday 
came after a week of relative peace in the townships 
men armed with guns and other weapons drove around the townships 
late saturday night in a van firing at pedestrians and getting out 
to attack said police spokesman capt eugene opperman 
the victims had been shot or hacked to death opperman said the 
townships are about 18 miles apart 
most of the recent fighting has pitted zulus loyal to the 
conservative inkatha movement against xhosas and other blacks who 
support the african national congress led by nelson mandela 
anc leaders speaking at a mass funeral sunday accused police 
of siding with inkatha in the recent clashes about 4000 people 
attended the service at a soccer stadium for 19 blacks killed in 
kagiso west of johannesburg 
alfred nzo the ancs secretary general said the victims died 
at the hands of the agents of the apartheid regime 
de klerk and police have said individual policemen may have 
acted improperly but the force as a whole has been impartial 
the speakers pleaded for tolerance among opposing black 
organizations but the youthful crowd shouted down a kagiso town 
councilor and a member of the panafricanist congress a rival 
group militant blacks consider black town leaders collaborators 
with the whiteled government 
de klerk requested law and order minister adriaan vlok to 
conduct an urgent and indepth investigation after a government 
report concluded police fired without reason on black demonstrators 
last march killing five and wounding 156 in sebokeng south of 
johannesburg 
certain allegations which have been made against the south 
african police are regarded in an extremely serious light de 
klerk said 
the anc which claims more than 10 people were killed at the 
sebokeng shooting called the reports findings an example of the 
indiscipline callousness and readiness to shoot on the part of 
the police 
de klerk also announced an inquiry into the system of 
migrantworker hostels for young single men 
he said the government wants to provide housing on a family 
basis but cannot because of a severe housing shortage among 
blacks 
these hostels cannot simply be closed or demolished without 
alternative accommodation being available said de klerk

the embattled founder of a desertsurvival 
program for wayward teens is fighting state efforts to close him 
down possibly as early as this week and criminal charges stemming 
from the death of a 16yearold charge 
stephen cartisano says the negligent homicide and child abuse 
charges are part of a vendetta by state officials liars 
jealous of his challenger foundations success he says he may just 
pick up and move to another state 
i have more success than these guys can ever dream about 
cartisano has said they want to put me out of business because 
they think they are the sole repositories of light and truth 
regarding children 
the sniping against the founder of the delawarebased company 
became a barrage this summer with the heat stroke death of a 
teenage girl enrolled in the challenger program and with 
allegations by other teenagers of being abused starved tied up 
and forced to eat lizards and mice to survive 
cartisanos critics describe him as a manipulator who places 
profit above concern for his young patients the program charges 
15900 for its 63day expedition 
basically he charges parents a lot of money to take their 
kids out in the desert and feed them roadkill said terry 
twitchell a spokeswoman with the state department of human 
services 
hes a liar said dr kay edrington a former challenger 
employee who claims cartisano misrepresented him to parents and on 
insurance billing forms as a psychologist 
ive known for some time there would come a day of reckoning 
for challenger edrington said 
it may be coming soon 
a state judge ordered the beleaguered program to come up with a 
100000 bond by tuesday to prove its financial ability to continue 
business without it the judge threatens to shut the program down 
in kane county sheriff max jackson has filed a misdemeanor 
negligent homicide count against cartisano and his former field 
director lance horsehair jagger in the june 27 death of 
kristen chase 16 
eight other counts of misdemeanor child abuse also were filed 
against the two men they are scheduled for arraignment sept 13 
challenger this summer sought protection under chapter 11 of the 
us bankruptcy code and claims assets of only 63000 state 
officials say challenger owes more than 279000 in federal and 
state taxes 
cartisano said he is considering leaving utah for less hostile 
surroundings 
ive had offers from southern nevada new mexico and 
arizona he said i hate to say you wont have steve 
cartisano to kick around anymore but its getting to that point 
yet some parents even the mother of the girl who died 
support cartisanos austere recipe for bringing as program 
literature puts it defiant irresponsible or rebellious 
teenagers out of their dream world and back to reality 
sometimes we need to be a little more calloused instead of 
pampering our little darling dumplings like weve been doing and 
not making them responsible for their own behavior said judith 
tepper of los angeles 
her teenage son jordan reportedly was tied to a tree by 
challenger counselors after trying to flee the program and dragged 
through the brush when he refused to hike 
another advocate is sharon fuqua of ponte vedra beach fla 
kristens mother the girl collapsed and died of heat stroke while 
hiking atop the rugged kaiparowits plateau 
ive never met any more dedicated loving people trying to 
help children she said after her daughters death 
cartisano said chases death cant be blamed on his program 
she could have walked over to central park and collapsed he 
said at the time 
challenger opened in 1988 an offshoot of a popular survival 
program offered at brigham young university in the 1970s that 
program was based on the idea that troubled youth could be helped 
if forced to cope and triumph in an unforgiving environment 
that cannot be manipulated 
some believe challenger has skewed those goals using the desert 
not as a lesson but as a tool for punishment 
during a recent court hearing attorneys described interviews of 
challenger patients one teen related a practice called rodeo 
described as punishment where they run until they couldnt run 
hike until they couldnt hike and then crawl until they couldnt 
crawl and then they were dragged 
several said they werent given any food for up to four days 
when entering the program and were forced to forage for meals 
assistant utah attorney general linda luinstra said a 
15yearold boy related that at one point he ate a lizard and at 
another he and some other children skinned a mouse and ate it 
nine wilderness survival programs operate in utah and officials 
estimate that as many as 300 teenagers hike and climb the 
breathtaking vistas of southern utahs redrock desert seeking a 
solution to problems of drug abuse laziness and low selfesteem 
the programs came under scrutiny after the deaths of chase and 
another girl 15yearold michelle sutton of pleasanton calif 
who died while enrolled in a similar program summit quest earlier 
this summer 
state officials have dogged challenger since its inception but 
up until now have succeeded only in forcing the program to obtain a 
state license 
challenger was granted a provisional 90day license on july 1 
ken stettler deputy director of the division of licensing 
promises it wont be renewed without radical changes 
cartisano boasts a 93 percent success rate children are 
returned to the program at no additional cost if they get into 
trouble before they turn 18

kuwait is promising financial assistance to 
american families facing money problems because of iraqs holding 
of their loved ones in kuwait the kuwaiti embassy confirmed sunday 
it was unclear whether any money had yet been provided any of 
the families or how much financial assistance was involved the 
embassy did not mention families of american workers held in iraq 
we stand ready willing and are able to share in the costs 
whatever we are asked for by these families kuwaiti ambassador 
saud nasir alsabah said in a statement 
all families who are currently in the us and who are facing 
economic or financial difficulties because of their husbands or 
relatives are being held hostage by the iraqis inside kuwait will 
receive assistance from the government of kuwait alsabah said 
he said the assistance would be coordinated through the us 
state department 
but the state department on sunday referred questions about the 
assistance promise to the kuwaiti embassy one department official 
speaking on the condition that he not be identified further said 
he was not aware of any payments having been made but were 
aware they made the offer 
there have been a number of reports of immediate families of 
americans being held by iraq facing financial difficulties at 
least one oil drilling company whose business with kuwait or iraq 
has been disrupted stopped paying the salaries of 16 workers who 
were in the two countries when the crisis erupted a month ago 
one of the first actions by president bush in response to the 
iraqi invasions of kuwait was to freeze all iraqi and kuwaiti 
assets in the united states the exiled kuwaiti government 
however has been given access to funds 
the kuwaiti embassy said the kuwaiti government has become 
concerned about the plight of many of these american families who 
have lost their income 
there are an estimated 2500 americans in kuwait and as many as 
500 in iraq while some of them have had their families with them 
many others working in oil fields were in kuwait alone with wives 
and children back in the united states 
most large companies are believed to have continued paying the 
workers but some have not 
a small texas company oge drilling inc of houston fired its 
16 workers in kuwait the day of the iraqi invasion our contracts 
with these people ended by basis of an act of war something 
beyond our control oge vice president jay simpson said recently 
simpson said the company which supplies workers for the kuwait 
oil co could not afford to continue paying the workers salaries 
with revenue no longer coming from the kuwaiti company 
ten of oges workers have escaped kuwait but six reportedly 
continue to be held 
one of the six workers edward hale was believed to have been 
among the first americans detained by the iraqis his wife 
patricia was stunned when told she no longer would be getting her 
husbands paycheck she said she faces serious money problems 
the kuwaiti embassy said the state department will seek out the 
families and determine who might need assistance

president bushs hastily called 
summit with soviet president mikhail gorbachev will likely consist 
of about five hours of talks devoted largely to the persian gulf 
crisis administration officials said sunday 
were comparing notes we would be explaining where we think 
the situation is where we would go one source said describing 
the discussion as similiar to the ongoing consultations bush has 
had with several other world leaders on the crisis 
on saturday when he announced the summit bush said the gulf 
crisis was one of many items to be discussed there is no special 
agenda relating to the middle east he said the meeting is 
scheduled for next sunday in helsinki finland 
although bush had said saturday he saw no mediating role for the 
soviets one official said sunday that bush would welcome any 
influence they may have in getting iraq to pull out of kuwait 
an administration official said sunday that any discussion of 
soviet mediation implies that the gulf crisis is a dispute between 
iraq and the united states the administration says that us 
forces are in the area to enforce an international response to the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and threat against saudi arabia 
the officials would speak only on condition of anonymity 
the administration on sunday began working out the details of 
the helsinki meeting 
everybodys scrambling to put their pieces together said 
one official bush returns to washington on monday evening from his 
threeweek vacation 
sig rogich the white house official in charge of advance 
logistics and imagemaking was called back from a vacation sunday 
to coordinate such details as where in helsinki the meeting will be 
held and what time 
sununu flew saturday to his home state of new hampshire after 
arriving saturday in washington from london and on sunday was 
driving his family back to washington he did not plan to see bush 
until the presidents return to the capital 
lowerlevel staffers met at the white house on sunday to begin 
work on logistics and contacting their soviet counterparts 
bush held his proposal for a summit meeting so closely to his 
vest that several top white house staff members did not know about 
it when they were in the soviet union during the week officials 
said bushs secretary of state james a baker iii made the 
arrangements by phone with his soviet counterpart 
chief of staff john sununu last week led a white house team to 
the soviet union at moscows invitation to explain the technical 
workings of the us executive branch 
sununu knew before he left that bush had proposed a summit 
meeting and was kept abreast of developments but did not play a key 
role in arranging the summit aides said 
while ongoing conventional arms talks will be on the agenda 
that portion of the meeting would just be a review of the 
negotiations between the two countries said an official 
the united states and soviet union are engaged in talks to 
reduce troops and tanks in europe and hope to get an agreement in 
time for a 35nation conference that is planned in europe in 
november 
bush and gorbachev also will discuss regional issues such as 
the ongoing conflict in cambodia and soviet involvement in 
afghanistan according to the president and his aides 
bushs wife barbara and gorbachevs wife raisa also will 
travel to helsinki no details of their schedule have been 
disclosed

saddam husseins invading troops was kuwaits central bank where 
employees were forced to open the safe the iraqis took about 365 
million kuwaiti dinars in cash worth more than 1 billion at the 
time 
but then saddam did a strange thing he linked the kuwaiti 
dinar to the iraqi currency which lowered its value by several 
hundred percent kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah alahmad 
alsabah was quoted as saying 
the iraqis also seized about 1 billion in gold ingots sabah

foreign hostages as guests mrs anderton said it is the only 
hotel i have ever been a guest in that i dont intend to leave a 
tip

told of eating a diet heavy on frozen turkey 
i have never eaten so much turkey in my life said 
sutherland

canned goods especially tuna

radical palestinian leader george habash 
has split with his longtime syrian backers and is now in iraq 
marking a major shift within the plo triggered by the persian gulf 
crisis informed sources reported sunday 
they also reported that another radical nayef hawatmeh is 
struggling to retain control of his group the democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine after a mutiny sparked by his support 
for syrias antiiraq stand in the monthold crisis 
the developments underlined the rift within the palestine 
liberation organization caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 
plo chief yasser arafats support for saddam qualified by a 
condemnation of the occupation of the gulf kingdom has alienated 
the organization from the arab mainstream that has opposed saddams 
action 
that has cut arafat off from the financial support of saudi 
arabia and other prowestern gulf states while at the same time 
firing up the plos radicals like habash and hawatmeh 
they reluctantly went along with arafats 1988 peace initiative 
in which he renounced terrorism and recognized israel they have 
long argued that only military struggle will achieve a palestinian 
homeland 
saddam has demanded an end to the israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip in any settlement of the gulf crisis 
habash 64 heads the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine the second biggest faction in the plo after arafats 
fatah movement 
his new alliance with saddam marks an increasing tilt by plo 
radicals toward baghdad amid growing fears that palestinian 
militants and other arab groups will launch terrorist attacks on 
us western and arab targets to support iraq 
hawatmeh 54 has said that he cannot back the iraqis who he 
says have done to kuwait what the israelis did to palestine but 
the democratic fronts deputy secretarygeneral yasser abedrabbo 
flew to baghdad with arafat last week cementing the split from 
hawatmehs leadership 
saddam already harbors the radical palestine liberation front a 
plo faction led by mohammed abbas known as abul abbas that group 
hijacked the italian cruise ship achille lauro in 1985 and was 
behind an abortive seaborne raid on israel last may 
that operation led president bush to suspend an 18month 
dialogue with the plo 
the official iraqi news agency said in a terse dispatch that 
saddam met with habash sunday on the crisis the agency made no 
mention of habashs old feud with iraq over his alliance with 
syrian president hafez assad saddams arab archrival 
the popular front gained notoriety in the early 1970s with a 
series of airliner hijackings that dramatically focused world 
attention on the palestinian struggle 
the informed sources speaking on condition of anonymity by 
telephone from iraq jordan and tunisia said habash flew to 
baghdad saturday on his first visit to iraq in 14 years they gave 
no more details

the day before labor day 1989 this 
resort strip was littered with broken bottles and bricks after 
clashes between police and thousands of youths 
sunday morning a beachfront stage was erected and 150 people 
some clad in their sunday best others in shorts and sandals 
gathered for an atlantic ocean baptism 
i am obviously finding that this is a much more enjoyable 
situation than a year ago said city manager aubrey watts 
while some have complained about an excessive buildup of police 
for this years laborfest the police presence and a smaller 
holiday crowd than last year clearly were having the affect of 
preventing violence 
the looting and clashes last year resulted in 158 arrests 43 
injuries 14 million in damage to stores and lingering 
accusations of racism and police brutality 
at sundays service which ended with a dozen baptisms in the 
atlantic ocean the worshippers clapped and raised their hands 
singing the lord god is holy 
were taking jesus christ out of the church out of the four 
walls of the church and into the streets and cities where people 
live said the rev wellington boone president and founder of 
new generation campus ministries 
students from predominantly black east coast colleges made up 
much of the crowd for the annual fraternity festival and most of 
them were not here to seek religious deliverance 
still the sunday baptism represented a sharp change in tone 
from last years festival attended by more than 100000 people 
police estimated the crowd this year at about 28000 people 
spokesman lew thurston said 48 people had been charged with 
misdemeanor offenses along the oceanfront as of 6 am sunday

iraqi president saddam hussein has 
done what pressure persuasion and countless cups of arabic coffee 
among diplomats could not given the united states a military 
headquarters in the middle east 
set up during the past week in a suite of borrowed offices at a 
saudi government building us central command forward is now the 
main nerve center for operation desert shield 
from his new post army gen h norman schwarzkopf oversees the 
growing american force dispatched to deter saddam and his 
formidable iraqi military units from invading saudi arabia 
if war comes it will be from the center and a communications 
center at an undisclosed location that schwarzkopf and his 
officers will run the battle 
capt ronald wildermuth central commands chief of information 
said about half the commands staff of 700 officers and enlisted 
personnel have been brought to saudi arabia from the headquarters 
at macdill air force base near tampa fla 
some riyadh hotels filled with the new personnel have become 
minor fortresses with concrete antiterrorist barricades blocking 
driveways and airporttype security checks for visitors 
americans wearing brownandtan desert camouflage mingle with 
whiterobed arabs in lobbies and coffee shops 
the command responsible for us military operations in 19 
nations in the mideast and southwest asia has been based in 
florida since 1983 because no arab nation was willing to act as 
host 
suggestions that this may be changed by desert shield are 
adamantly rejected by both senior us and saudi officials 
centcom forward they say is temporary and will disappear 
once the gulf crisis is over 
we have made it very clear that we have no intention of 
establishing permanent bases in saudi arabia said schwarzkopf 
us defense secretary dick cheney who helped convince saudi 
king fahd of the need for american help following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait quoted the saudi monarch as saying he trusted 
the united states to fulfill its commitment and leave if asked 
the value of a forward headquarters and supply base has been 
obvious to us leaders since central command was established as a 
spinoff from the carter administrations rapid deployment force 
in the absence of groundbased facilities in the gulf the 
united states has depended on longrange airlift and the 
prepositioning of material at diego garcia a base in the indian 
ocean about 2500 miles away 
except for oman which allowed the navy refueling privileges and 
an airstrip for a reconnaissance plane during the iraniraq war 
the nearest thing to a permanent us base in the region is at 
bahrain where a small naval squadron the middle east force has 
been stationed since 1949 
bahrain provides dock space for the forces flagship uss la 
salle and the use of a small shore facility the american profile 
is so low however that uniforms are never worn on shore and us 
diplomats caution newcomers not to offend the bahrainis by 
referring to the facilities as a base 
in 1988 reports circulated that the longdesired forward base 
had found a host country bahrain has since been named as the 
country but the deal fell through after the iraniraq war came to 
a close last year 
most us officers wont comment when asked whether the current 
crisis could lead to a permanent presence with american forces 
staying on to protect the saudi oil fields 
a us officer who asked not to be identifed said he believed 
desert shield might help to convince the arabs that having us 
around isnt such a bad thing 
if that should happen he said we will owe it all to 
saddam hussein

in a true test of international diplomacy a team 
of soviets and americans will try to break a world record by 
spending 20 days in the dark without showering while wearing rubber 
suits 
its not a stunt for ripleys believe it or not the 10man 
international team is headed to the caucasus mountains in the 
soviet republic of georgia to best the worlds caving depth record 
currently just under a mile 
it is our little way of international peace through caving 
said john sheltens president of the national speleological 
society speleology is the scientific study and examination of 
caves 
the group based in huntsville ala sent four of its members 
from illinois tennessee and alabama to the southwestern tip of the 
soviet union on friday for the expedition which they hope to begin 
by the end of this week 
the americans and six soviets want to descend one mile 5280 
feet that would beat the record set at a cave near grenoble 
france where explorers descended 5250 feet 
to beat the depth record the team will actually have to climb 
a 10mile hike up the mountains in the republic of georgia will 
bring them to the entrance of the sneznaya cave 7500 feet above 
sea level 
a separate 10man team will be stationed at the mouth of the 
cave while the cavers spend nearly three weeks surrounded by rock 
walls another crew made an advance descent into the cave to set up 
provisions at two campsites 
after reaching the top of the glacierlike mountain the cave 
dwellers will don dry suits special rubber clothes to protect 
against wetness then the descent begins 
the first 2000 feet of descent is mostly vertical a series 
of pits that well have to do on rope said john moses a chemist 
from the chicago suburb of glen ellyn who is leading the expedition 
then what happens is that part of the cave intersects a major 
river passage were hoping the dry suits float 
the team will follow the river floating in it if necessary to 
a depth of at least one mile below the surface 
the cold and damp will likely be the most bothersome but there 
are mental challenges as well moses said 
were going to be climbing into a soggy sleeping bag and when 
you are out of touch with daylight you tend to crave a taste of 
color moses said 
another problem could be communicating 
language is always a stumbling block said sheltens who 
explored with the soviets during the societys first trip to their 
country but when youre with people that are doing the same 
thing that you are doing you work things out 
the trip is the second the caving society has made to the soviet 
union in two years the society is currently the host of a group of 
soviets on a multistate caving excursion the second tour of its 
kind sheltens said 
what we are finding out is that we are much more alike than we 
are different sheltens said in a telephone interview from his 
home in hot springs sd

new yorkers are giving their 2 cents worth to 
the citys subway system nearly 1 million pennies a week in 
fact to purchase ride tokens 
clerks and transit authority officials say some people are 
flooding token booth clerks with pennies in revenge for a recent 
15cent fare hike and what they perceive as poor service 
you can tell because they come down the stairs with a smile on 
their face shaking a fist full of pennies said token clerk 
sydnye thomas they put the handful of pennies in the slot and 
turn their head and laugh 
the pennies slow the work of the clerks longer lines at token 
booths have become common since the cost of a token rose in january 
from 1 to 115 
the transit authority which operates the subways is getting so 
many pennies that it is now the largest depositor of pennies with 
the federal reserve the new york times reported sunday 
the number of pennies received by token clerks increased from 
300000 a week to about 950000 a week after the january price 
boost 
signs at token booths read no pennies but the signs add 
please because pennies are legal currency and cannot be 
refused

the government sunday acknowleged it was 
rationing food but said iraqis would rather eat mud than bow to a 
foreign power 
government spokesman naji alhadithi denied reports that the 
un embargo on iraq caused shortages but said the government was 
instituting steps to reduce food consumption 
we have a wartested society we have a wartested economy so 
even if we eat mud we will resist pressure and not kneel down to 
any foreign power he said 
last week sources inside iraq said rationing was to begin sept 
1 and foreigners who left the country reported lines for bread and 
other food 
the un embargo enforced by a flotilla of us and other 
warships has halted nearly all of iraqs vital oil exports and food 
imports aiming to force an iraqi pullout from kuwait 
alhadithi and information and culture minister latif nasaif 
jasim took a defiant stance in a meeting with reporters sunday 
saying iraq wanted peace but was prepared for war 
jasim claimed iraq which fought an eightyear war with iran 
was not afraid of war with the united states which deployed tens 
of thousands of troops in the saudi desert after iraq invaded 
kuwait a month ago 
he said his country had 15 million men under arms and 55 
million volunteers ready to fight 
during the war with iran hundreds of americanmade planes 
darkened our skies and even our children used to throw rocks at 
these planes jasim said so if bush wants to stay in power he 
will pull out his soldiers and not make war 
we need only bread and water we need no more than that we 
can live for a long time said jasim dignity is more important 
than food 
under a plan organized by the ruling baath party stores will 
limit the quantity of certain products that can be sold at one 
time alhadithi said 
if you need one kilogram 22 pounds of rice you will be 
allowed two but not 10 in the past you could get 20 he said 
the plan he said is a precaution prompted by the un 
sanctions but not a response to any spot shortages 
we are determined to live on our own cultivation said 
alhadithi iraq reached selfsufficiency in vegetables and fruit 
during the war with iran 
he said production of rice and wheat were up significantly and 
that the government had taken steps to encourage farmers to put 
more land into cultivation 
two food store owners in baghdad iraqs capital said they had 
been told the rationing plan would limit purchases of such items as 
rice sugar tea cooking oil baby food detergent and soap 
we really dont think about this im not hoarding everything 
is here we are not worried about it said one shopper who 
declined to give her name

amnesty international on monday accused 
communist guerrillas of massacring more than 50 people in two train 
attacks in central cambodia 
in a statement the international human rights group urged the 
cambodian guerrilla coalition which includes the communist khmer 
rouge to ensure that those involved in the killings are removed 
from their positions and brought to justice 
amnesty international said the victims apparently were singled 
out because they were employees of the vietnameseinstalled 
government in phnom penh 
at least 26 people were rounded up and shot dead when a train 
was ambushed and stopped in kompong trach on july 1 and at least 
30 others died in a similar incident in kompong chhnang on july 
15 the statement said 
at amnesty internationals london headquarters an official said 
the information came from sources who have been in contact with 
people in cambodia he said the sources could not be identified 
in previous reports western journalists have quoted injured 
survivors at phnom penh hospitals as saying the guerrillas killed 
several civilians in the july 15 attack the survivors said land 
mines crippled the train before the khmer rouge struck with grenade 
launchers and machine guns 
at the time the khmer rouge radio said the guerrillas killed 15 
soldiers and wounded 15 others but made no mention of civilian 
casualities 
the cambodian governments official spk news agency reported on 
july 16 that robbers had killed more than 100 passengers and taken 
their property in an attack on a train in kompong trach 
the news agency said gen tea banh the defense minister 
mentioned the raid while speaking two days earlier about the fight 
against the guerrillas 
it was not possible to determine whether the spk report was 
referring to the killings cited by amnesty international spk did 
not specifically mention the khmer rouge or give the date of the 
attack some claims by the phnom penh government have been 
exaggerated 
in the past the united states and amnesty international have 
also accused the phnom penh government of serious human rights 
abuses 
the city of kompong chhnang the capital of the province of the 
same name is about 50 miles northwest of phnom penh kompong trach 
is about 60 miles east of the cambodian capital 
the khmer rouge slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people in 
rural slave labor camps and execution chambers when it held power 
from 197578 vietnam installed the current communist government 
after its forces invaded phnom penh in late 1978 
the khmer rouge supported by china now is allied with two 
noncommunist groups in the guerrilla coalition the usbacked 
forces of prince norodom sihanouk and son sanns khmer peoples

a former presidential adviser said he 
has solid information that iraqi leader saddam hussein offered 
egyptian president hosni mubarak a 25 million bribe to try to keep

investigators narrowed their list of 
prime suspects to four sunday in the grisly knife slayings of five 
students and hinted that the serial killer left messages of some 
importance 
police would not say whether 18yearold edward lewis humphrey 
a parttime freshman at the university of florida charged with 
assaulting his grandmother was among the four 
however two police officers in hip waders on sunday used a 
metal detector to search a creek next to the apartment complex 
where humphrey lives 
they did not appear to find anything said police cpl robert 
mcdowell police have already picked over garbage in the complexs 
trash containers but have not said whether they recovered a murder 
weapon 
an ohio fugitive 58yearold warren virgil tinch was dropped 
from the list said alachua county sheriffs spokesman lt spencer 
mann tinch is sought in ohio in the stabbing death of a 
52yearold woman and is suspected of stealing cars in ocala and 
gainesville a week before the killings 
to say hes still a suspect in the slayings would be 
incorrect mann said but he said police were not prepared to say 
who is on the list 
a week after the first two mutilated bodies were found police 
disclosed sunday that the killer left messages or clues at the 
victims apartments that could tie him to all five murders but 
they refused to characterize these messages except to say they were 
not in the form of notes or other writings 
the messages were given to us from the crime scenes said 
lt sadie darnell spokeswoman for the gainesville police 
department the messages are indirect ones that were 
interpreting to be messages of some importance 
mann added that no calling cards were found on any of the 
bodies 
its not a signaturetype homicide mann said 
autopsy results on tracy inez paules and manuel taboada both 
23 showed they died of stab wounds similar to those that killed 
the other three mann said sunday but unlike the first three the 
bodies of miss paules and taboada were not mutilated 
mann declined to say whether the same weapon was used in all 
five slayings 
miss paules and taboada were found tuesday at the apartment they 
shared at the same complex where humphrey lived for a few weeks 
this summer a neighbor said humphrey was romantically interested 
in miss paules and often waited for her by the pool 
also killed were christina powell 17 of jacksonville sonya 
larson 18 of deerfield beach and christa hoyt 18 of newberry 
all five lived at offcampus apartments on the citys southwest 
side and all were students at either the university of florida or 
sante fe community college 
most of the university of floridas 34000 students were gone 
over the weekend for the labor day holiday many who stayed 
attended church services sunday to mourn for the victims 
i pray were not so gripped by fear that were afraid to go 
out and meet people drew settimio told the congregation at 
crossroads church of christ which included many students i pray 
the fear of our community will be eased 
humphrey an indialantic youth authorities have described as 
emotionally troubled remained in the brevard county jail on sunday 
pending a 1 million bond on charges of assaulting his 79yearold 
grandmother police kept up surveillance at his gainesville 
apartment and car in indialantic but still have not sought search 
warrants to check them out 
to do so a judge would have to rule that there is enough 
evidence to show probable cause of humphreys involvement in the 
crimes 
were not going to do anything to jeopardize this case mann 
said were going to do it right were going to do it by the 
book 
brevard county public defender rj russo said he was puzzled as 
to why no search warrants had been sought and said he planned to 
ask tuesday for a reduction in humphreys bond 
up to 18 investigators flew saturday and sunday to at least nine 
other states to follow up on tips and leads related to the 
slayings darnell said the states were california new york 
oregon montana alabama louisiana mississippi tennessee and 
nevada although darnell would not name specific towns 
university president john lombardi said sunday that school will 
continue as usual when it reopens tuesday except for continued 
escort services increased security and extended deadlines for 
students to withdraw from or change classes 
so far about 100 students have decided either to transfer or 
sit out a semester because of the slayings lombardi said 
we believe this community to be as safe as any other 
university community in america he said would i send my child 
back to the university of florida yes i would

israeli officials said sunday that any 
political solution to the persian gulf crisis that leaves saddam 
hussein in power means iraq will remain a danger to world stability 
yossi olmert head of the government press office said it would 
be disastrous if president saddam remained in power considering 
his plans to develop nuclear weapons 
such a resolution will not be as we would like it and it 
shouldnt be to the liking of the us nor to the arab world 
olmert said on israel radio 
he added that at the least iraqs armed forces which invaded 
oilrich kuwait one month ago should be damaged to the point where 
saddams ambitions are blocked even if the man stays alive at 
least for a period of time 
israels military is on heightened alert but officials also 
have said israel has no plans to attack iraq unless attacked first 
in 1981 israeli warplanes destroyed an iraqi nuclear reactor 
believed to be developing an atomic bomb 
justice minister dan meridor who also spoke on the radio said 
saddam must not be allowed even part of his war spoils 
several other israeli officials including defense minister 
moshe arens and air force commander maj gen avihu binnun have 
suggested that the gulf crisis must end with saddams ouster 
olmert and meridor both said sunday their statements were not 
intended as advice to president bush who has not said he seeks 
saddams ouster

a violent crime or property crime hit one in 
four us households last year virtually the same level as the 
past five years a justice department report said sunday 
in 1975 when this statistical series commenced about one in 
three households was struck by crime said steven dillingham 
director of the bureau of justice statistics which produced the 
report 
the actual percentage of households that suffered a violent 
crime or property crime was 249 percent up slightly from 246 
percent in 1988 the report found the figures include attempted as 
well as completed crimes 
a total of 235 million households suffered from one of the 
crimes checked rape assault robbery personal theft household 
theft burglary and motor vehicle theft 
the bureaus figures come from the national crime survey which 
annually interviews members of 49000 households nationwide to 
determine crimes to household members who are at least 12 years 
old the ncs does not check for murder because it compiles its 
information from surveys of victims 
a total of 49 percent of households experienced a violent 
crime with 39 percent suffering assault 1 percent robbery and 
01 percent rape the survey found the year before violent crime 
had hit 48 percent of homes 
meanwhile 178 percent of households suffered from some kind of 
theft including 112 percent personal theft and 81 percent 
household theft 51 percent suffered from a burglary and 16 
percent motor vehicle theft 
among the surveys findings were that like previous years 
households headed by blacks urban households and households with 
higher incomes suffered a higher percentage of crimes than other 
population segments 
a total of 291 percent of all black households suffered from an 
ncs crime a slight increase from 29 percent in 1988 and 64 
percent of them suffered from a violent crime a decrease from 66 
percent in 1988 
as for households headed by caucasians 243 percent suffered 
from an ncs crime up from 239 percent the previous year and 47 
percent were victimized by a violent crime a slight rise from 46 
in 1988 
some 255 percent of the households of other races combined 
asians pacific islanders and native americans also suffered from 
an ncs crime down from 274 percent in 1988 the percentage of 
those homes that suffered from a violent crime also decreased to 
54 percent from 56 percent 
a separate ethnicity category for hispanics and nonhispanics 
shows that a greater percentage of hispanic households suffered an 
ncs crime last year than in 1988 last year 338 percent of 
households headed by hispanics were victims of an ncs crime up 
from 30 percent the previous year meanwhile 73 percent of 
hispanic households suffered a violent crime up from 65 percent 
in 1988 
meanwhile the percentage of urban households that have been 
victims of crime increased from 303 percent to 312 percent a 
greater number of suburban households also were victimized up 
from 238 percent to 242 percent at the same time rural 
households experienced less crime with only 172 percent 
suffering compared with 18 percent in 1988 
the portion of households with incomes of 15000 and above that 
suffered from a crime edged downward last year while crime hit a 
larger portion of households with lower incomes than it had in 
1988 still the households with the highest target rate 27 
percent were those with incomes of 25000 or more

washington 
a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said there were no plans to debrief the americans and

hundreds of western women and children held hostage by iraq 
including some who served as human shields to deter any us 
attack arrived back home sunday after flights from iraq 
but the departure of several hundred more western women and 
children from baghdad was apparently delayed as iraq withheld 
landing clearance for special flights from britain and france 
in addition thousands of other hostages including husbands and 
fathers of those allowed to leave remained trapped in iraq and 
occupied kuwait with no immediate prospect of leaving 
east germanys ambassador in kuwait was said to have been taken 
forcibly to iraq after leaving his compound which has been 
besieged by iraqi troops along with the us and other embassies 
the east berlin government was negotiating with iraq for the 
release of ambassador kurt merkel 56 a government spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity 
also sunday about 12000 mostly arab and asian refugees 
streamed from iraq into jordan where tens of thousands of 
impoverished evacuees already languish in refugee camps thousands 
were trying to cross into turkey and iran 
totals provided by various airlines and diplomats indicated that 
nearly 700 westerners and japanese were allowed to leave iraq over 
the weekend 
in all about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans were 
trapped in iraq and kuwait by the aug 2 iraqi invasion of its 
oilrich neighbor 
in london a spokesman for virgin atlantic airways said the 
airline had been planning a special flight to baghdad on monday 
after hearing from british diplomatic sources that about 200 more 
western women and children including some americans would be 
ready to leave 
but the spokesman said the airline received a telex sunday 
afternoon from iraqi civil aviation authorities revoking landing 
clearance 
in paris the french foreign ministry said iraqi authorities so 
far have not granted landing permission for an air france airbus 
that has been on standby at le bourget airport north of paris the 
plane had been scheduled to fly to baghdad on monday morning to 
pick up western hostages the french news agency afp said 
french news reports said the delay was caused by bickering over 
the timing of the flight with the iraqis insisting that the plane 
not arrive at night or in the early morning 
british and french officials said they had asked their embassies 
in baghdad to continue pressing the iraqis to allow the flights to 
land 
if that is not possible a british foreign office spokesman said 
hostages could return home on iraqi airways even though regularly 
scheduled flights by the iraqi carrier are banned under the un 
trade embargo 
a chartered iraqi airways boeing 747 that left baghdad with more 
than 300 westerners including 47 americans arrived outside 
washington on sunday after stopovers in paris and london to

a multinational west african force 
in liberia took control of the capitals center after battling 
rebels loyal to charles taylor the ghana news agency reported 
sunday 
the news agency which has a correspondent with the 3000man 
force quoted ghanaian lt col george ayiku as saying his troops 
in monrovia overcame stiff resistance from the rebels saturday and 
set up heavy artillery 
on sunday a ghanaian ship left monrovia with 7000 refugees but 
left 5000 others behind the news agency said 
taylors rebels have been accused of killing hundreds of people 
from the five west african nations that sent the troops to liberia 
aug 24 to end the war in which about 5000 people have died most 
of those killed have been civilians 
taylor who controls most of liberia after eight months of civil 
war opposes the fivenation force the force has been welcomed 
both by the government of president samuel doe and a rival rebel 
group who separately control portions of the capital monrovia 
the ghana news agency earlier reported that the task forces 
units had advanced beyond spriggs payne airfield in eastern 
monrovia in an effort to reach embassies of three of the countries 
contributing to the force ghana nigeria and guinea the other two 
are gambia and sierra leone 
monrovias 400000 residents have been without water and 
electricity for more than two months and food stocks were running 
low as all regular transport links with the outside world were cut 
guerrillas loyal to prince johnson who split from taylor six 
months ago controlled monrovias port and most of the city center 
areas on the citys eastern fringes were under the control of does 
troops but were under regular attack by taylors fighters 
the rebels accuse the doe government of corruption and human 
rights abuses but both rebels and troops have reportedly killed 
civilians loyal to the other side during the civil war the 
government has accused taylor of embezzlement when he served as a 
doe aide 
taylors rebels were holding several thousand ghanaians 
nigerians and guinean citizens ghanaian refugees accused the 
insurgents of killing at least 200 of their countrymen taylor has 
confirmed holding the foreigners but denied that his forces had 
killed any 
a ghanaian merchant ship the mv tano river sailed sunday 
with 7000 ghanaian and other west african refugees it was bound 
for the ghanaian capital port of accra 
two women died of malnutrition on board the ship while waiting 
for it to depart two refugees drowned while trying to climb a rope 
to board the ship the news agency said after officers said the 
ship could take no more passengers at least 5000 refugees were 
left behind in the port 
taylor invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 and his fighters 
quickly overran most of the west african country of about 25 
million people but were stopped on the outskirts of the capital 
johnson who split with taylor in february took control of much 
of monrovia but was unable to drive doe from his heavily fortified 
mansion us marines stationed on warships off liberia have 
evacuated americans and some other foreigners from monrovia 
marines also remained posted around the us embassy but 
washington says us forces will not intervene in the fighting 
the five west african countries making up the task force say 
they are participating because they have citizens in liberia and 
because 400000 liberian refugees are straining the resources of 
neighboring countries

the canadian army seized control of the main 
mohawk barricade in this town on sunday without firing a shot and 
trapped about 30 armed men inside a small wooded area of the 
kanesatake indian territory 
seizing the main barricade at oka the center of an indian 
uprising over land claims effectively ended a standoff that began 
july 11 when quebec provincial police launched a raid on the 
militants one officer was killed but it is not clear by whose 
gunfire 
lt col pierre daigle commander of the canadian forces in this 
sector about 20 miles west of montreal said sunday he had carried 
out his instructions to take over the barricades and was awaiting 
further orders he said there are between 350 to 450 troops and 80 
armored vehicles in the oka area 
however no fighting broke out between the soldiers and indians 
who warily watched one another for most of sunday military 
helicopters flew over the area 
mohawk spokesman ellen gabriel said the indians are pretty 
squeezed in right now theres no way out really 
the mohawks fortified their positions by using a frontend 
loader to pile earth on a road near a twostory alcohol and drug 
detoxification center in the woods 
after a sevenweek standoff quebec premier robert bourassa last 
week ordered the army to dismantle the barricades 
the army moved into the kanesatake mohawk settlement overlooking 
oka 18 miles west of montreal on saturday afternoon after 
factional fighting broke out between moderate and militant mohawks 
two indians were injured in the fighting before the army moved in 
however when the soldiers pushed forward only one shot was 
fired by a mohawk on saturday daigle said there were no 
casualties 
barricades set up in the kahnawake mohawk reserve near the 
mercier bridge south of montreal came down peacefully over the 
last few days the barricades were set up as a sympathy protest by 
mohawks there 
the warriors a militant mohawk organization periodically came 
out from the trees and stood facetoface with soldiers at oka on 
sunday on one occasion a warrior approached a soldier stood 
chesttochest with him and stared into his eyes as a group of 
reporters watched 
finally he let out a war whoop turned and walked away i 
want to see their face before i kill them the warrior said 
just after 830 am about two dozen troops backed by two 
armored personnel carriers moved onto highway 344 and began 
approaching the main hilltop barricade none of the warriors made a 
move to stop them the soldiers strung barbed wire around the 
barricade and inspected it for booby traps 
daigle was vague about whether warriors would be allowed to pass 
through his lines and leave if they so desired the lieutenant 
colonel said his forces had no power of arrest 
i have been giving orders to subordinate officers to remain in 
their positions and to consolidate where they are he said 
the uprising began when officials of the village of oka decided 
to expand the local golf course onto land claimed by the mohawks 
including an indian cemetery that problem was solved earlier when 
the federal government purchased the land and said it would give it 
to the indians 
but the mohawks seized the occasion to press an entire range of 
complaints and land claims against federal and provincial 
authorities that move sparked numerous brief sympathy blockades 
across the country in recent weeks 
at the mercier bridge troops cleared out the last obstructions 
set up seven weeks ago there was no resistance but officials said 
it would still take several days before the bridge could open to 
traffic 
the mercier blockade had angered residents of the south shore of 
the st lawrence river who were forced to make long detours to get 
to jobs in montreal 
across canada indian leaders sunday denounced the army 
operation at oka 
it was a bungled job all the way right from the start and 
the mohawks are not responsible for that its the federal 
government and the quebec government phil fontaine leader of 
the manitoba assembly of chiefs said in winnipeg

dozens of americans returned to freedom sunday in the first 
major airlift of westerners from iraq during the monthold persian 
gulf crisis but saddam husseins government remained defiant and 
vowed to eat mud before yielding 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who held two 
days of talks in amman jordan with the iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz said he was deeply disappointed with the outcome 
what iraq wants is to stay in kuwait which is unacceptable to 
the international community to the un security council and to 
its secretarygeneral perez de cuellar told reporters in paris 
sunday 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and president bush are to 
discuss the gulf crisis and other issues sept 9 in helsinki 
finland but even following the weekend announcement of the 
superpower summit some leaders warned a speedy resolution was 
unlikely 
we have to settle down for a long haul which will require a 
good deal of steady determination on the part of all concerned 
said british foreign secretary douglas hurd 
for the freed hostages joy and relief upon reaching safety was 
muted by fears for those left behind saddam the iraqi president 
is using captive foreigners as human shields to protect key iraqi 
installations against potential attack by the usled 
multinational force deployed in the region 
about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans were 
stranded in iraq and kuwait by the aug 2 invasion 
a chartered iraqi airways boeing 747 carrying more than 300 
westerners arrived in washington on sunday after stopovers in 
paris and london it left baghdad on saturday along with two other 
planeloads of foreigners 
among those arriving in britain was stuart lockwood the 
5yearold british boy whose hair was tousled by saddam in a 
television encounter with a group of western hostages last month 
the sight of a smiling saddam clasping the uncomfortablelooking 
child brought expressions of revulsion from western leaders 
stuart arrived home sunday with his mother and brother but his 
father was still being held 
the flight continued on to washington and the 47 weary 
americans arrived at dulles international airport outside the 
capital after 24 hours of travel one of the arrivals 76yearold 
lloyd culbertson of el paso texas was asked if the hostages left 
behind feared for their lives 
yes they certainly do he said 
at tokyos international airport 68 japanese women and children 
arriving on a japan air lines flight were greeted by tearful 
relatives and friends a day after leaving iraq japan welcomed 
their release but expressed fears for 344 of its nationals still in 
iraq 
a lufthansa plane with 250 women and 61 children on board 
including 60 americans and 71 germans landed early sunday in 
frankfurt west germany after leaving baghdad late saturday a few 
arriving passengers smiled briefly or waved but nearly all looked 
grim and exhausted 
the airlifts came after saddam in what he called a humanitarian 
gesture announced last week that women and children among the 
foreign captives would be allowed to leave iraq 
however the departure of several hundred more western women and 
children from baghdad was apparently delayed as iraq withheld 
landing clearance for two special flights from britain and france 
if permission is not granted a british foreign office spokesman 
said hostages could return home on iraqi airways even though 
regularly scheduled flights by the iraqi carrier are banned under 
the un trade embargo 
western governments have demanded the release of all the 
hostages and denounced iraqs footdragging in freeing the women 
and children as promised 
confirming previous reports that iraq had begun to ration food 
government spokesman naji alhadithi said in baghdad we have a 
wartested society we have a wartested economy so even if we eat 
mud we will resist pressure and not kneel down to any foreign 
power 
iraq fought iran in an 8yearwar that ended in 1988 
at the same meeting with reporters culture minister latif 
nasaif jasim declared we need only bread and water we need no 
more than that we can live for a long time 
dignity is more important than food he added 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher heaped scorn on 
saddam over the hostageholding calling him a person who has 
taken hostages cruelly brutally and a person who has hidden 
behind the skirts of women and children 
this man is a loser she said in an interview aired sunday 
on britains tvam network the official iraqi news agency 
responded by calling the prime minister an old hag 
in occupied kuwait hardships intensified at embassies defying 
an iraqi order to close their doors many missions are without 
power and water surrounded by troops and the skeleton staffs 
operating the missions are virtual prisoners 
a diplomatic source in brussels said sunday the east german 
ambassador was picked up by iraqi authorities and taken to baghdad 
he had ventured out of his embassy where food and water were 
running low to visit the west german mission 
in other developments sunday 
iraqi officials told foreign reporters who arrived in the 
country before aug 27 that they must leave on or before next 
tuesday a government spokesman told the reporters they were being 
asked to leave to make room for other foreign journalists who were 
awaiting entry visas 
two us cargo ships entered the suez canal on their way to the 
persian gulf a canal official said they will join around 30 us 
ships in the region including three aircraft carriers a 
battleship armed with tomakawk crusie missile more than one dozen 
missile cruisers destroyers and supply ships 
kuwaiti officials said that iraq plundered 2 billion worth of 
kuwaiti gold and cash as well as 15 kuwait airways planes when it 
invaded the allegations appeared in the british weekly observer 
newspaper which interviewed several exiled kuwaiti leaders in

for george bush the easy part is over so 
far he has only had to cope with saddam hussein congress is back 
in town next week 
the president got a glimpse of the shape of things to come if he 
checked on what was said afterward by the 170 members of congress 
who interrupted their vacations for a presidential update on the 
persian gulf showdown 
bush appealed for bipartisan support and he got it effusively 
but there was an uneasy undertone after the session that suggested 
criticism is lurking especially if the deployment turns into a 
stalemate 
stalemate is the best bush can hope for it beats war while 
he waits for the international quarantine of iraq to work 
but american public opinion is not so good at waiting 
not if the price of gasoline keeps rising and the economy keeps 
sinking 
not if television carries pictures of kuwaitis on the french 
riviera driving to rallies in their mercedes benz automobiles to 
cheer on the american boys 
not if american women soldiers on full television display in 
soldierly roles for the first time run afoul of cultural 
differences in a saudi society that gives women scant status and no 
equality 
bush can stand the heat from congress but if the american 
people turn against this enterprise they can ultimately end it 
that was vietnams lesson for policymakers 
mark mellman a democratic pollster guesses bush has a fairly 
short period 
if we just keep 200000 troops in the saudi desert without 
them having any clear goals other than deterrence i think his 
support will dissipate fairly quickly mellman says it may be 
60 days it may be 90 days it may be six months but we dont have 
something happen by christmas id guess support will dissipate 
americans are impatient by and large and goaloriented and 
successoriented he added this represents a tremendous 
financial commitment and an emotional commitment and for many 
people a real hardship 
political scientist dick barody of stanford university a 
student of public opinion says he is still mystified over whether 
public opinion leads the politicians or vice versa 
people who want to do other things with the money will begin 
to portray this as a warthatisnt and a foreign policy that isnt 
getting us anywhere barody says 
at the end in vietnam the public could no longer stomach the 
war and congress responded by refusing to appropriate money for any 
purpose there other than to bring home the troops 
after hearing from bush last week lawmakers did not directly 
challenge his decision to confront saddam hussein 
when politicians want to be critical of a policy that appears 
popular they attack it from the fringes rather than frontally 
thats what happened 
they complained that while bush has rallied the worlds support 
for isolating saddam the venture is still largely an american 
undertaking 
if we dont watch it well have a 90 or 95 percent share of 
the ontheground troops said rep david obey dwis i dont 
think thats politically sustainable at home 
rep david bonior dmich said his constituents already are 
complaining that the japanese the australians and others are not 
doing enough rep christopher smith rnj added the soviets to 
the list 
they said bush had failed to articulate americas purpose they 
said he had to specify the nature of the threat to the us 
national interest 
sen joseph biden ddel told bush directly participants 
reported that lawmakers like himself who came of age during 
vietnam want to know what were doing in saudi arabia 
rep mike dewine rohio said it was time for bush to get on 
television and put before the country not only our specific 
objective but the rationale and the reasoning behind those 
objectives sen john h chafee rri said bush owed his 
countrymen as fine an explanation of our presence as can be 
produced 
and they criticized the administration for failing to develop a 
policy that would make the country less dependent on foreign oil 
rep norm dicks dwash said some pointed out to bush that he 
hadnt even brought his energy secretary james watkins to the 
meeting 
none of that is direct criticism of what bush has done in 
standing up to saddam there will be none if he succeeds but in 
this situation stalemate is not success 
dicks said that erosion of public support is inevitable 
already there are people asking why is it we are out 
there he said is it just because of cheap oil
