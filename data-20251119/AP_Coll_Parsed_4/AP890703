the kirov ballet from leningrad not seen here in 
25 years opened at the metropolitan opera with le corsaire a 
threeact spectacle with a story that doesnt make much sense but 
with exciting virtuoso dancing 
the kirov from leningrad is known as a company of great 
dancers floating with grace in contrast to the more sturdy 
athleticism of the bolshoi ballet of moscow that impression was 
confirmed monday night 
le corsaire is known to most balletomanes only for the second 
acts spectacular trio which rudolf nureyev who defected from the 
kirov translated into an exhilarating duet for himself and dame 
margot fonteyn 
the fulllength ballet dates from 1856 in paris it begins with a 
shipwreck with dramatic effects of a sailboat rocking wildly on a 
stormy sea 
three shipwrecked pirates corsaires are found by two greek 
maidens a slave trader danced with brio by konstantin zakinsky 
captures the maids and one of them danced by yelena pankova is 
sold to a doddering pasha for his harem the other maiden the star 
of the ballet danced by altynai asylmuratova is rescued by one of 
the pirates danced by yevgeni neff 
miss asylmuratova and neff are costumed like princess and prince 
and on monday they danced as regally as they were garbed 
as much applause as they received the dazzling farukh ruzimatov 
received more he dances the part nureyev took with dame margot 
the slave trader captured by the pirates escapes from them and 
recaptures miss asylmuratova before the pirates finally free both 
maidens most of the third act is taken up with a trio of ballerinas 
and the corps de ballet fluffy in pink and led by miss pankova as 
fast and light as a sugarplum fairy in an effect which no american 
company would use fountains play behind a silverpink backdrop 
the ballets score more prettified than distinguished is put 
together from music by five composers the version the kirov dances 
has choreography by marius petipa as staged in 1955 by pyotr gusev 
miss asylmuratova and ruzimatov were guest artists of american 
ballet theater here this past season 
the kirov performed in the united states in 1986 a tour which 
did not include new york the present tour has the company at the 
met july 3 through 22 kennedy center in washington july 25 through 
aug 6 the war memorial opera house in san francisco aug 9 through 
16 and orange county performing arts center in costa mesa calif

as the ragtag continental army struggled 
through the brutal winter at valley forge gen george washington 
turned to colonists like jacob de haven who died broke after 
loaning 450000 in money and supplies 
or did he 
every generation or so somewhere in the country someone 
claiming ancestry to jacob de haven insists he did and seeks 
repayment whether interrupted by civil war or failure of congress 
to act the efforts have been fruitless 
in us claims court in houston an attorney fresh out of law 
school is awaiting the governments response to the latest request 
the lawsuit filed in march on behalf of some 50000 de haven 
descendants asks for 450000 plus 6 percent interest compounded 
annually since at least jan 1 1778 
put away your calculator thats a whopping 983 billion 
this is the first attempt to go through the federal courts 
instead of congress which was dunned in the 1850s 70s 90s and 
early in this century a repayment resolution was introduced but 
tabled in the house in 1966 
jo beth kloecker who took the case about two months after 
hanging a shingle outside her first office in stafford texas 
expects the governments response to the suit due in may 
sometime this month 
the claim is not without legal obstacles 
the sixyear statute of limitations expired about 205 years ago 
the suit seeks repayment from a united states that didnt exist when 
the money was lent and a receipt bearing a red seal of the 
government has been missing for years 
in addition theres no record of a wealthy jacob de haven whose 
family owned much of upper merion township now suburban 
philadelphia 
according to tax records for 17691812 the areas only jacob de 
haven lived in nearby whitpain township owned an acre of land in 
1791 and worked as a laborer said judith meier of the historical 
society of montgomery county 
theres no proof of a jacob de haven who lived in that time or 
died who could have loaned 450000 said mrs meier whose 
curiosity was piqued by the familys claim it looks like its out 
there hanging on an imaginary nail 
a family history describes the de havens as the wealthy owners of 
a tract stretching about 10 miles from norristown to philadelphia 
mrs meier says the history is a fairy tale and the relatives of the 
jacob de haven she found were all farmers weavers masons tanners 
and other tradesmen 
the family history also puts de havens grave in the cemetery of 
christ old swedes church now in the shadow of an elevated stretch 
of interstate 76 the rev john miller jr vicar of the episcopal 
church said records dont show a jacob de haven and most of the 
marble markers have been worn bare 
kloecker however thinks shes got a case 
i know what youre talking about she said of the lack of 
records adding that she has some unrecorded deeds showing jacob de 
haven existed as in the legend weve got some evidence i cant 
comment on what weve got 
beyond deeds and tax records the one piece of evidence that 
would prove a loan was made a receipt has been gone for 
generations said carl dehaven a descendant of jacobs brother 
samuel dehaven a retired police officer who lives in gulph mills 
said it was probably kept in a family bible now lost 
kloeckers client thelma weasenforth lunaas is decended from 
william de haven another brother of jacobs kloecker is asking the 
court to declare all the descendants of jacob and his nine brothers 
and sisters part of the class 
they just want his ancestry recognized for his contributions 
she said 
dehaven doubts any of the relatives will see any money 
nothings ever been done over the years and i dont think anything 
will be done this time 
he would be happy with a monument at valley forge national 
historical park commemorating the de havens and other families who 
gave to the cause 
in that legendary winter of 177778 washingtons troops were 
encamped at valley forge about 25 miles from britishoccupied 
philadelphia about 3000 of the 11000 troops living in crude log 
cabins died the continental congress couldnt appropriate any more 
money to send food so the call went out for citizens to lend the 
army money and food 
jacob de haven and many others responded his descendants say 
most were repaid after the revolution in continental dollars jacob 
refused to accept the unstable scrip which kloecker describes as 
not worth a flip

the kremlins influence here isnt limited 
to the troops in the street poland also has soviet television 
cars books and newspapers and mandatory russian language lessons 
through high school 
a changing political climate in poland and hungary where 
president bush will visit next week has emboldened citizens of the 
two countries in recent years to openly express longsilenced 
resentment of the soviet presence 
at the reburial ceremony in budapest on june 16 for imre nagy 
leader of the 1956 revolt viktor orban of the independent youth 
group fidesz drew loud applause when he advised if we muster 
enough courage then we can put an end to communist dictatorship 
and we can make sure that the immediate withdrawal of soviet troops 
is begun 
and in the southern polish city of krakow marches by young 
people chanting sowiecki do domu soviets go home have 
become regular events the youth often try to march on the citys 
soviet consulate and once vandalized a monument to red army war 
dead prompting an apology to the soviet ambassador by prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
the red army is officially on hand to defend the warsaw pact 
countries from a nato invasion but many poles and hungarians regard 
it as little more than an occupation force to guarantee continued 
communist rule it was soviet troops who put down hungarys 
anticommunist revolt in 1956 and led the warsaw pact forces who 
toppled czechoslovakias reform government in 1968 
in recent weeks the red army started withdrawing 50000 troops 
from east germany hungary poland and czechoslovakia in a pullback 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced in december as 
part of plans to cut the soviet army by 500000 troops by 1991 
the announced cutbacks which are to include 5000 tanks affect 
about 10 percent of soviet forces in eastern europe though welcomed 
almost universally the cuts have not quenched popular sentiment for 
even more 
the soviet presence in poland is not limited to the troops 
one of three tv stations in warsaw is relayed via satellite from 
moscow soviet television also can be seen in the wroclawlegnica 
area where soviet troops are concentrated but the soviet channel 
is not widely watched because of the antipathy many poles feel 
toward the soviet union and the fact that many do not understand 
russian despite the school requirements 
soviet lada cars are popular in poland and are considered by many 
residents to be superior to polishmade fiats and polonezes they 
are mainly purchased with hard currency through state dollar shops 
or private importing agencies 
soviet bookstores are in most major cities and pravda is widely 
available 
towering over central warsaw is the monolithic palace of culture 
and science a much mutteredabout gift from josef stalins soviet 
union an ofttold joke in poland says the best view of warsaw is 
from the top of the palace of culture because that is the only place 
from which one cant see the palace of culture 
most poles rarely see the estimated 40000 soviet troops among 
them the units remain secluded in tree and fencesurrounded bases 
away from towns they are rarely mentioned in the press or state 
broadcasts except in the case of the occasional military accident 
that has to be explained 
only in a few places like legnica the site of soviet military 
headquarters 260 miles southwest of warsaw is it common to see 
young russian or asian soldiers on the street 
hungarians do not hide their dislike of the troops a hotel 
waiter in esztergom near the czechoslovak border when asked by 
western diners about the helicopter noise outside answered with 
disdain and a deprecating gesture the soviets hungarian 
officials have long insisted that their country be included in the 
first phase of any withdrawal 
in poland there is a long antagonism toward the soviet union 
the countries warred in 1920 soviet troops occupied eastern 
poland in 1939 two weeks after nazis invaded from the west and over 
the next decade hundreds of thousands of poles were deported to the 
soviet union many thousands died including 4200 polish officers 
executed at katyn 
only recently has it become possible for poles to speak openly 
about this painful past after decades of propaganda proclaiming 
unblemished friendship between the polish and soviet people 
but whenever antisoviet feelings threaten to become too shrill 
leaders in poland and hungary hasten to point out that the 
transformations under way in their countries depend on gorbachevs 
reforms at home 
political reforms under way in the soviet union are 
indispenable international conditions for the success of endeavors 
for democratic socialism hungarian premier miklos nemeth 
emphasized in a june interview 
hungarian officials have flirted publicly with the idea of a 
neutral hungary someday but only if both military blocs were 
dissolved 
in poland some opposition pragmatists state a need for a defense 
alliance with the soviet union even if poland becomes totally 
democratic 
despite resentment of the soviet military presence gorbachev and 
his reform program are popular here leading figures in the 
independent solidarity movement have led the cheering for 
perestroika and have come back from moscow with enthusiastic 
accounts of its progress 
but many people still ask will it last 
the american people think that gorbachev can change a lot but 
we know the soviet union so much better said one architecture 
student in a warsaw park declining to give his name

a plan to keep palestinian day 
laborers in a fencedin compound while they wait to be hired in 
petah tikva has fueled debate over the wisdom and morality of using 
arabs to work in israel 
critics of restrictions on arab laborers say the practice is 
similar to what nazis did to jews in germany but proponents 
maintain that after 18 months of a violent palestinian uprising in 
the west bank and gaza strip restrictions are necessary for safety 
and security 
caught in the middle are the arabs who usually work as 
construction laborers street cleaners garbage collectors and at 
other menial jobs and their employers who pay them about half what 
israeli workers would have to be paid 
in the west bank settlement of ariel officials backed down from 
a plan to make the arabs wear tags labeling them alien workers 
after critics compared them to the yellow stars of david that jews 
were forced to wear in nazi germany 
when the town council in petah tikva a city of 150000 six miles 
east of tel aviv approved the holding area for arab workers in may 
some israeli newspapers said it amounted to a temporary prison 
the original plan called for a fencedin holding pen where arab 
workers would be required to show their identity cards and wait to 
be hired 
but after the public outcry the town decided to do away with 
plans for the fence and a legal requirement that workers wait inside 
instead a metalframe shelter with a green plastic roof was 
erected over three park benches a portable toilet was put up 
nearby on one recent day the shelter was empty and several arab 
workers waited at a corner about 100 yards away 
people are afraid to go to the shelter said one of the 
workers identifying himself as only as faisal they are afraid of 
the police or of citizens here who might plant bombs or shoot guns 
at us 
avraham oren a petah tikva town council member who opposes the 
shelter said it would probably never be used because of the 
controversy it has caused 
this idea that it is possible to put people in pens is like 
segregation of the races he said 
but council spokesman shuki yelin defended the shelter saying it 
was meant to ease fears by jewish parents that their children might 
be attacked by arabs on the streets 
we built it because many jewish citizens protested and sent 
petitions saying they are suffering because of the presence of the 
arabs near their houses yelin said 
its not racist we know we are criticized but its not a 
jail we dont force them to go its an open place 
similarly expressed fears have been behind other moves to 
restrict arab workers 
mayor zvi zilker of the southern israeli town of ashdod 
temporarily barred all palestinian laborers recently after a soldier 
was killed nearby and another disappeared and was believed 
kidnapped police said they suspected palestinians from the gaza 
strip in both cases 
after the attacks on soldiers the israeli government also began 
requiring gaza arabs to obtain new work permits and restricting 
those with records of crime or security offenses 
but rightwing calls for barring all arab workers from israel 
have brought an outcry from employers who depend on them 
the issue has opened up a debate that touches not only israels 
economy but also many israelis vision of their country as a bulwark 
of jewish morality that does not condone exploiting the arabs 
professor ehpraim yuchtmanyaar a social psychologist at tel 
aviv university says israelis are torn between dependence on arab 
workers and guilt over their treatment 
people recognize the labor is vital for the israeli economy 
he said they are doing lowstatus jobs that israelis prefer not 
to do but morally many israelis feel the arabs should be treated 
equally to jewish workers because they are not it is 
exploitation and should be denounced 
moshe semyonov a tel aviv university sociologist says the 
segregation of arabs is being fostered by a curious alliance between 
rightwing israelis and traditionalists who see the use of arab 
labor crushing their dream of an israel built by jews 
people on both ends of the political spectrum are against 
depending on arabs one out of antagonism the other for humanistic 
or moral reasons semyonov said

a program which provides nursing homes and 
other housing for the elderly is under scrutiny by federal 
investigators a senior department of housing and urban development 
official said monday 
the department is reviewing an inspector generals audit of the 
retirement service program and secretary jack kemp could make 
decisions about the program as early as next week the official said 
nursing homes will probably be next said the official 
citing kemp actions to suspend or overhaul other department programs 
in the wake of highly critical investigative audits by the inspector 
general 
the new york times said in tuesda editions the department is 
considering proposals to overhaul or terminate the program which has 
left the government liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in 
mortgages on troubled housing projects for the elderly 
the newspaper said half of the 24 projects in the midwest that 
were audited were in default or financial difficulty 
i think its premature what will be proposed said the 
official thats secretary kemps decision and he hasnt made it 
the official who asked not to be identified did not give an 
estimate of possible government losses however anytime a 
significant percentage of those projects are in default you begin to 
wonder about the program he said 
last week kemp cancelled a mortgage insurance program after an 
audit found 25 of 58 projects financed throught the program had 
defaulted the department estimated the outstanding debts would cost 
the government 90 million 
other federal housing programs including subsidies for 
rehabilitation of housing for those with moderate incomes a 
coinsurance program and a program in which at least one private 
escrow agent who handled sales of foreclosed property has admitted 
stealing more than 5 million are under investigation by congress 
and the justice department for mismanagement political 
influencepeddling and other abuse

a dovish israeli legislator says he has started 
to carry a pistol after being threatened by rightwing extremists 
who oppose his views on the israelipalestinian conflict 
there are very specific threats telephone calls letters 
saying we shall kill you we shall harm your family abraham 
burg of the labor party said in an interview on monday 
i live in a secluded place and i also travel a lot burg 
said politically im at the forefront of the struggle against 
the radicals thats why im carrying a pistol at all times 
the legislator would not reveal what type of pistol he carries or 
when he purchased it 
burg the son of a former interior and police minister yosef 
burg belongs to the dovish wing of the centerleft party and is 
known as a supporter of a farreaching territorial compromise as a 
way of solving the israelipalestinian conflict 
he said that threats from rightwing extremists seem to be linked 
to his frequent radio and television interviews and that they 
follow immediately 
some of the callers he said have identified themselves as 
belonging to the sicarites an extremist underground group named 
after biblical jewish assassins who killed collaborators with rome 
in the first century 
the group has claimed responsibility for the submachinegun 
attack in april that left one palestinian dead and three wounded 
near jerusalems old city and for at least eight arson attacks on 
apartments and cars belonging to leftwing israelis 
the daily davar reported monday that parliaments security 
officer had decided to equip other leftwing legislators with guns 
after they too have been threatened by extremists 
it said some liberal legislators already carry weapons 
parliament spokeswoman sara yitzhaki refused comment on the 
report 
burg confirmed that leftwing lawmakers have been threatened but 
said he was not aware whether any of his 119 colleagues in the 
israeli parliament or knesset carried a weapon

last week buddhist monks and the elders of the 
cambodian community came to bless a wobbly twostory house they 
squatted on a mat in the living room and while incense burned they 
chanted 
but the house was really an exhibit at the boston childrens 
museum and a crowd was watching the opening of the last phase of 
from time to time celebrating 75 years at our house 
the exhibit a realisticlooking twostory house built in a 
highceilinged part of the museum has during the past nine months 
been the home to four families portrayed by actors representing 
the citys shifting immigrant tides over the last seven decades 
the latest to move in last week is a cambodian family the soks 
played by cambodianamerican actors 
before the soks whose fictional biography has them as refugees 
who arrived in america in 1981 there were actors portraying the 
robinsons a black family who moved into the neighborhood during 
the 1960s 
before that other actors from the city stage company portrayed 
the gutermans jewish immigrants who lived in the house in the 1940s 
and 1950s and the fitzgeralds a boisterous irish clan that first 
inhabited the home in 1913 
were trying to make irish families jewish families all the 
different ethnicities familiar said dorothy merrill who helped 
develop the project we want to make the arena comfortable for the 
kids so they can ask questions and better understand lives different 
from their own 
wander through the plywood home and youre drawn in the same 
oriental hall rugs that the fitzgeralds once trod now wind upstairs 
toward two bedrooms where 10 of 11 sok family members sleep and 
share a single bathroom 
in place of the gutermans victrola is a vcr showing tapes of 
festivals and dances that have been sent to area cambodians from the 
folks back home 
its a way for the kids in america to stay in touch with their 
cambodian culture said museum spokeswoman gail eaton 
its also a way for natives of this country to get in touch with 
unfamiliar cultures the 120000 exhibit which its creators 
believe is the first of its kind has drawn thousands of kids into 
the daytoday experiences of generations past 
the actors in each family have been provided with fictional 
biographies historical background and other information so they can 
answer visitors questions as if they really were the persons they 
were portraying 
i try to get the kids to respond to learn about my culture 
said virak ui the 16yearold cambodianborn actor whos playing 
the part of the sok familys teenage son thy sok his older sister 
plays the mother 
visitors really get a look inside the lives merrill said 
the robinsons had problems with bostons segregated schols and 
mrs guterman talks to people about how hard it is to keep kosher 
she thinks of herself as a modern woman and isnt real interested in 
sending her kids to hebrew school 
kids seem to become more tolerant toward people different from 
themselves after theyve seen the cupboards stocked with foods 
similar to those they eat and a bulletin board displaying family 
photos not altogether unlike those on their own refrigerator at 
home merrill said 
brian viens 13 said a cambodian family lives down the block 
from his family 
my brother said he saw them once burning a flag the 
teenager said sprawling in 8yearold rathsan soks upstairs 
room i dont know if its true now they have beds the same as 
mine 
some of the children weaving in and out among the simply 
furnished rooms pause for a moment ponder over the buddhist shrine 
or the slippers placed carefully in a pocketed bag by family 
members who have left home for the day 
others just like the fun of it all 
yeah this stuff is interesting but the thing i really liked 
was all the old baseball cards that other family had 14yearold 
mark chace said recalling his visit to the gutermans home three 
months ago they were great

folks who can cluck like a chicken america wants you men with 
spindly legs youre in demand too ditto people with crayfish that 
can scoot like secretariat 
no such talents dont mean a future of broadway lights but 
small town america has learned how to make fun from the oddest 
festivals and theres always time for a contest or exhibit at these 
woodstocks of weirdness 
consider the chicken show this weekend at wayne neb 
organizers say they expect 5000 to show up for the national 
cluckoff a parade with the theme of science fiction chicken 
frankhenstein is expected and a beautiful beak contest 
when the chicken was mentioned everyone started laughing and 
we havent stopped since said gail korn one of the shows 
organizers 
toadfish are honored with a zany festival at sausalito calif 
even though their droning mating calls drive houseboatdwellers nuts 
crayfish also have their festivals organizers in isleton 
calif where a crustacean race tops the schedule call them 
crawdads in shreveportbossier city la theyre mudbugs 
there are sweet corn fests where folks chomp away on steaming 
ears by the ton and at least one horseradish fest where 
aficionados enjoy their favorite delicacy in smaller bites also 
celebrated are prunes possums sauerkraut spinach raisins and an 
legendary alligator named twotoed tom which fell in love with a 
sawmill whistle at esto fla 
some themes are played with a nudge and a wink the heeney 
colo tick festival pays ironic tribute to a diseasespreading 
critter some do double duty key west flas hemingway days 
combines seminars and an ernest lookalike contest 
dana pomerenke chairman of the great texas mosquito festival in 
clute texas gives a theme explanation that is typical of the 
tongueincheek festival faction 
someone said weve got a lot of mosquitoes around here so 
lets capitalize on it and do something crazy like start a mosquito 
festival said pomerenke the latejuly event will include a 
mosquito legs lookalike contest and a ms quito beauty contest 
deceased stars and fictional icons of popular culture james 
dean star trek are popular particularly if the dear departed 
happens to have been born in a small town the typical metropolis 
has given birth to too many stars to single out just one but 
metropolis ill adopted superman and holds a fest in honor of the 
man of steel every year 
it doesnt even matter if the stars didnt set foot in their 
hometown after making it or even as in the case of judy garland 
and grand rapids minn if they are said to have lived out their 
lives being glad they left 
any town that bills itself as the somethingorother capital of 
the world is a festival candidate of course 
the brick capital of the world malvern ark has a 
brickthrowing contest at its fest while at the cereal capital of 
the world battle creek mich they unfurl yards of checkered 
tablecloths and feed breakfast to thousands 
in heeney colo population 45 the first annual tick 
festival eight years ago was just a picnic to celebrate one 
womans recovery from rocky mountain spotted fever an illness borne 
by ticks this year up to 3000 people showed up june 10 to take in 
the parade the crowning of the tick king and tick queen and other 
events 
it sounds like a weird idea for a festival but it gives us 
something to do said dj parlin a 1989 tick queen nominee 
its always heeneys biggest event of the year and its real 
popular with visitors 
given the agricultural roots of so many of the fests its no 
surprise that cowchip throwing is a festival staple its 
permissible to put a plastic bag or glove over your hand before you 
pick one up 
some people throw overhand and some throw them like a 
frisbee said sandy franky of chatham ill where the sweet corn 
festival next month will feature a chip throw everyone has their 
own style 
but not all festivals are just fun fun fun 
the last weekend in june comfrey minn held its annual 
hospital days festival and fundraiser for its eightbed hospital 
said to be the smallest in minnesota they took in 11000 before 
expenses this year from burger sales and a dunk tank where you could 
douse the mayor local schoolteachers or people who wanted to cool 
off said hospital administrator john holmes 
this is very very very dear money to us he said we use 
it to pay bills it is very much needed

the us embassy charged monday that chinese 
soliders targeted american diplomats apartments when they opened 
fire june 6 on a foreigners housing complex and said it was filing 
a protest 
the move was likely to worsen relations between the two 
countries already made tense by us criticism of chinas military 
crackdown on the studentled prodemocracy movement 
the shooting in which hundreds of rounds of bullets were fired 
into the jianguomenwai apartment compound came a day after the 
state department announced the embassy had given refuge to two 
chinese dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian 
a us embassy report on the shooting which charged 
premeditation did not link it with chinas anger over us 
protection of fang and li 
the united states filed one protest shortly after the shooting 
the new protest in the form of a diplomatic note challenges for 
the first time the chinese account that the soldiers were responding 
to sniper fire from within the apartment compound 
radio beijing said at the time that one soldier was killed and 
three injured and plainclothes officers who went into the compound 
brought out a chinese man they claimed was the sniper 
no witnesses reported seeing chinese soldiers hit 
the us embassy report said the arrest appeared to be staged it 
also said the soldiers fired not only from the ground but from a 
building across the street where they had taken up positions the 
day before 
a diplomat from another western country confirmed that some 
bullets were fired from the opposite building and whizzed over the 
heads of children who were playing on the floor in the foreigners 
apartments he said the shooting appeared intended to intimidate 
foreigners 
no one was hurt but most foreigners evacuated the compound later 
that day 
there is no doubt in this embassys opinion that certain 
apartments were deliberately targeted by the army the us 
embassy report said 
it said one us defense attaches apartment was hit by 18 
bullets ten other us diplomats apartments also were hit 
chinese guards stationed outside the us embassy who normally 
carry only revolvers were armed monday with longbarreled automatic 
pistols and wore military helmets for the third straight day 
the guards appeared in the new gear saturday when the embassy 
held an independence day party for american residents in beijing 
one guard said they would maintain their tighter security through 
tuesday which is americas independence day but refused to explain 
why 
on sunday the first tourists were allowed to enter central 
beijings tiananmen square since the army seized it june 34 and 
drove out prodemocracy protesters killing hundreds of unarmed 
civilians 
a bus was driven onto the square early sunday and about a dozen 
foreigners climbed out authorities said groups with advance army 
permission would be allowed to visit the vast square but it 
remained closed to the general public 
the assault on tiananmen began the crackdown on the studentled 
movement for a freer society authorities have since arrested more 
than 1800 people and announced 27 executions 
one student said sunday that he and many others still were 
stunned by the violence the government says up to 300 people died 
in the crackdown chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources 
say up to 3000 were killed 
the student who did not want his name used gazed at the square 
from behind a gate and said that despite their horror at the 
crackdown many of his peers still want to join ruling communist 
party to further their careers and were quietly accepting the 
government line that troops were needed to quell the protests 
party membership means the person was good in school is in 
good health has the right thoughts and is likely to move ahead in 
the world the student said 
but the highly publicized party pledges to clean up its act 
indicated the party is aware of deep popular discontent 
television news reported that three party members from a beijing 
suburb were sentenced to prison terms of one to 10 years for 
accepting bribes in their capacity as factory managers a shanghai 
legislator was sentenced to eight years for taking bribes according 
to the report 
it did not say if they were expelled from the party 
widespread corruption has destroyed public trust in leaders and 
the students gained broad popular support for demanding an end to 
corruption during the seven weeks of protests 
over the past few years the party announced several 
anticorruption campaigns followed by arrests but no toplevel 
leaders were prosecuted and many chinese said the campaigns only 
highlighted the extent of corruption

the old folk tale that the blood rises during a 
full moon inducing violent crime shouldnt scare anyone according 
to a group of researchers 
in fact fewer people are hospitalized when there is a full moon 
and those who are admitted fare slightly better than those admitted 
at other times of the month according to a report by two doctors 
and a statistician at allegheny general hospital 
this theory of the lunar cycle impacting the type and number of 
patients with traumatic injuries that an emergency room gets when 
the moon is full has been part of medical folklore almost forever 
so we decided to take a look at it said dr dietrich jehle 
director of emergency medicine research at allegheny general 
the study was published saturday in the annals of emergency 
medicine 
jehle dr wendy coates and statistician eric cottington reviewed 
the type and extent of injuries for 1444 trauma patients admitted 
to the hospital during a 12month period they also noted the 
patients outcomes 
the team identified 129 patients who were hospitalized on the day 
of the full moon the day before or the day after 
the researchers compared that groups medical problems and 
outcomes to 1315 trauma patients admitted on the 330 days of the 
year when there wasnt a full moon 
during the full moon the average number of patients admitted was 
358 per day compared with 398 per day the rest of the month 
those injured when the moon was fullest stayed in the hospital 
for an average 10 days compared with a 12day stay for those who 
came in the rest of the month 
the study found 54 percent of those injured during the full moon 
died compared with 103 percent of those hurt during the moons 
dark phase 
and allegheny generals helicopter flew fewer patients when the 
moon was brightest according to the study 
jehle and his colleagues said they could not fully explain their 
findings 
but they wrote a brighter night sky might deter criminal acts 
and better illuminate roadways

covered wagons rolled into town as modernday 
pioneers dusty and tired but grinning retraced their ancestors 
journey across the prairie to mark north dakotas 100 years of 
statehood 
now a onehour horseback ride isnt going to seem like 
anything said myrtle worth a teacher from healy alaska 
she joined the red river centennial wagon train on horseback 15 
days and 300 miles ago when it was assembled at her brothers farm 
in abercrombie near the north dakotaminnesota line 
the red river group with about 30 wagons and 150 riders ended 
its trek by meeting sunday with three smaller wagon trains in 
bismarck and neighboring mandan for the states fourday party of 
the century 
organizers expected up to 100000 people would come to bismarck 
and mandan which together are home to about 65000 people for the 
event that ends tuesday 
worth 54 got more than a history lesson during her adventure 
the mornings were cool and very nice but by the afternoon 
everybody was tired she said when you have to spend 10 to 12 
hours a day on anything you get tired 
the wagon train had its mishaps riders thrown from nervous 
horses runaway wagons and a team of mules that refused to budge a 
few riders were injured broken arms or legs and a concussion and 
many were exhausted 
once we had to ride through a heavy thunderstorm worth 
recalled we ended up in a pasture waiting while it rained about 
1 inches in 20 minutes it was so ridiculous we all started 
laughing 
meals were eaten in fields and campgrounds and sponge baths 
replaced showers but the wagon train was welcomed in each town it 
passed 
the riders saw the freshness of the prairie in the morning and 
grazing cattle sheep and horses lined up to give them a pasture 
audience they learned to depend on each other as did their 
ancestors 
one of the wagons had a man who played an accordian worth 
said and we had one group from bismarck that came and sang we 
went to dances but most of the time we were too tired so we just 
sat around and told stories

lawmakers across the nation are pledging allegiance to a 
constitutional amendment to bar desecration of the flag and scores 
of legislative leaders predict easy ratification of the initiative 
in their states 
it would blow through our house and senate like a thunderstorm 
through kansas said republican paul burke president of the 
kansas senate i doubt anybody would be opposed 
less than two weeks after the us supreme court said burning the 
american flag is a legal form of political expression full 
legislatures in five states have passed resolutions supporting a 
constitutional amendment against flagburning 
legislative bodies in at least 10 other states have approved 
resolutions criticizing the ruling or calling for an amendment to 
reverse it and dozens of legislative leaders elsewhere said such 
sentiment ran strong in their states 
as majority leader ill tell you this if there are two or 
three votes against it i would be honestly surprised said 
republican rep craig moody of utah the legislature there as in 
many other states is in summer recess 
president bush on friday proposed a 20word constitutional 
amendment that would give states the right to prohibit desecration 
of the flag it requires approval by twothirds of the house and 
senate and ratification by 38 states 
in alaska it would pass within 30 days declared senate 
president tim kelly youre going to have a few liberals whining 
in the house but theyll be overwhelmed by the majority of 
legislators and public opinion 
the last constitutional amendment to gain the required 38 states 
was the one allowing 18yearolds to vote in 1971 the equal rights 
amendment died in 1982 after it got support from just 35 states 
within the time limit prescribed by congress 
all states but alaska and wyoming have laws banning flagburning 
and lawmakers there have said their lack of such a law was an 
oversight the supreme court ruling nullified state flagprotection 
laws 
most legislative leaders contacted by the associated press last 
week supported an amendment to overturn the courts ruling others 
were troubled by the idea 
i am not a bleeding heart said democratic state sen denny 
jacobs of illinois but i dont support meddling with the 
constitution 
i dont believe you honor the flag by dishonoring the basic 
rights contained in the constitution and bill of rights said 
democratic house speaker joe king of washington state our current 
constitution has worked well in protecting everything the flag 
stands for 
nontheless support for a flagprotection amendment spanned party 
lines and many ideological viewpoints in california even 
democratic assemblyman tom hayden a prominent antiwar protester in 
the 1960s voted in favor of a resolution urging congress to approve 
the measure 
calling it a close call as an issue hayden said he believed 
flagburning incites violence another california assemblyman 
republican tim leslie framed the issue another way what kind of 
message are we sending to our children when we say its ok to burn 
the flag 
legislatures in colorado louisiana maine and south carolina 
have approved resolutions calling on congress to pass a 
flagprotection amendment the california assembly also passed such 
a resolution but it has not gone to a vote in the senate the ohio 
house passed a resolution calling for an amendment while the ohio 
senate simply condemned the ruling 
the house or senate in at least 10 other states and a kentucky 
legislative committee have passed resolutions critical of the 
ruling and sizable groups of lawmakers in alabama and arkansas 
criticized it without any formal vote the 10 states are texas 
illinois rhode island pennsylvania new hampshire massachusetts 
delaware new york nevada and north carolina 
in texas the house approved a resolution urging a constitutional 
amendment just two days after the high court ruled but action was 
delayed in the texas senate by democrat craig washington who urged 
colleagues to focus their attention on the values the flag 
represents not the flag itself 
the flag is nothing but a piece of cloth he said 
new mexico rep blake curtis a republican saw it differently 
its a little more than just cloth he said its a symbol of 
freedom

the supreme court is concluding its 198889 
term today by issuing its latest word on abortion rights 
the word could come in a momentous ruling or a brief announcement 
that the justices need more time to ponder the fate of legal 
abortions 
the missouri case in which the justices were asked to reverse 
the courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion was the courts most 
closely watched controversy of the decade 
decisions also were pending today in two other cases including 
an important churchstate dispute from pittsburgh and a taxrefund 
case from arkansas and florida 
in each case the justices had to announce a decision or hold it 
over their threemonth summer recess if they chose the latter a 
new round of arguments would be held in the court term that begins 
in october with announcement of a decision likely in 1990 
abortionrights advocates feared the court would order the 
missouri case called webster vs reproductive health services 
reargued next term and simultaneously grant review to up to three 
other abortion disputes pending before the justices 
that likely would be read as a signal that the justices are 
contemplating a major retreat from the 1973 ruling in roe vs wade 
which said women have a constitutional right to abortion 
the court has yet to take action in the other three abortion 
cases which involve state regulations making it harder to get an 
abortion in illinois ohio and minnesota 
roe vs wade itself was argued twice before a decision was 
announced the court hears arguments in about 150 cases each term 
and since 1977 has held over at least one case each year for 
reargument the following term 
the 1973 ruling said a womans decision to have an abortion 
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and 
her doctor it said states may regulate abortions during the second 
trimester only to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however 
in the past decade about 15 million legal abortions have been 
performed each year opponents of roe vs wade wanted to make states 
free to stringently regulate or even outlaw abortion 
antiabortion and prochoice forces had said they did not 
consider it likely that the court would use the missouri case to 
reaffirm roe vs wade 
both sides had believed there could be five votes among the 
courts nine members willing to give states more leeway in 
regulating abortion 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white 
dissenters from the 1973 ruling opposed it in each subsequent case 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy were considered 
willing to reverse or significantly curtail the ruling as well 
justice sandra day oconnor the only woman on the high court 
was seen as possibly providing the key fifth vote 
in two previous abortion rulings she has criticized the 
trimesterbytrimester approach adopted in 1973 and voiced a 
willingness to give states more regulatory power

city leaders liked their first 
centennial celebration so much they decided to hold another 35 
years later 
in 1954 stephenville marked the 100th anniversary of the days 
when developer john m stephen and texas revolutionary george erath 
were parceling up the land to form the town 60 miles southwest of 
fort worth 
this year theyre celebrating the 100th anniversary of 
stephenvilles incorporation which transformed it from town to city 
we dont call this the centennial said billy mobley head of 
the chamber of commerce some people werent happy we were having 
another 100year celebration because they were instrumental in 
organizing the first one 
about 12000 people are expected to attend the annual parade and 
fourth of july fun fair which opens the festivities a summerlong 
series of events ends sept 12 with a fish fry 
stephen and erath arrived at the green rolling hills near bosque 
creek in the mid1850s and began dividing stephenville into lots 
said clinton cox who helped organize the 1954 centennial there is 
little record of what went on from 1854 to 1889 
stephenville now a city of 15500 was incorporated on aug 6 
1889 the first city council meeting was sept 13 
bob self a city council member who proposed this years festival 
and is cochairman of the organizing committee said he thought it 
made more sense to celebrate the citys 100th anniversary this 
summer than in 1954 
when we celebrate july 4th were not celebrating the pilgrims 
landing here were celebrating the establishment of the 
government he said

this indian town in the mountains of 
western mexico has one working public telephone four polling places 
and two mayors 
one chief executive represents the institutional revolutionary 
party or pri which has run mexico for 60 years the other 
represents the deep gulf between the pri and much of the state of 
michoacan 
together the two men show why sundays state assembly election 
is seen as a key test for the pri whose authority has seriously 
eroded 
people in this town of 30000 175 miles west of mexico city 
take their franchise seriously and believe it has been long been 
systematically violated by the pri 
emboldened by the opposition sweep of michoacan in national 
elections last year they occupied city hall in december demanding 
that thenmayor octavio rios be replaced 
most cheran residents are purepeche indians but rios is not a 
purepeche and is not from cheran and many said he had been imposed 
from outside 
in february they held a town assembly and chose dr alberto 
munoz a purepeche local as their mayor 
the quiet rebellion got the attention of the pridominated state 
government within weeks the state assembly named a new mayor also 
a purepeche from cheran 
that made people even madder said poll watcher jose 
velazquez as a cluster of women in the regions distinctive black 
and indigo shawls lined up at a ballot box sunday under a steady 
drizzle 
the new pri mayor manuel santa clara came out to vote sunday as 
well volunteer poll watchers said it was a rare public appearance 
for a man the citizens refuse to acknowledge 
i dont go sometimes santa clara admitted in an interview at 
his home where a rickety table on the patio serves as his office 
its not because im afraid its because i dont want to provoke 
people 
santa clara said munozs government is collecting proper state 
and federal taxes and sending them to the state capital in morelia 
constituents say the munozrun public services have been operating 
munoz assisted by the towns tradition of communal labor has 
even launched some small water projects with funds donated by 
constituents 
but santa clara said he has custody of the mayoral stationery 
the city treasury and budget and the official rubber stamps and 
seals he dismisses munozs role 
all he has is city hall and city hall is just a building 
santa clara said 
for many michoacanos city hall has became an important symbol of 
their discontent and their support for the opposition democratic 
revolutionary party 
in december 50 of the states 113 city halls were occupied 
several are still padlocked and at least three other towns have 
parallel governments like that of cheran 
munoz was out of town sunday but fellow citizens were eager to 
talk about cherans exercise in improvised democracy 
santa clara has the money the backing of the government but 
he doesnt have the support of the people said velazquez 
the pri admits the 1988 elections showed the government it has 
run for three generations had alientated the people of michoacan 
where leftist candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas soundly beat the pris 
carlos salinas de gortari 
a massive public works program was launched and for the first 
time local party congresses were held to nominate candidates for the 
state assembly race 
they have ignored us for years one of velazquez fellow poll 
watchers said his weathered face creased into a smile now 
suddenly were important 
they want to recoup the government velazquez but the 
people dont want the pri 
the new pri mayor brought in a shipment of pipe for a water 
project to be built with communal labor but cherans people scorned 
it huge piles of pipe lie under the arches at city hall 
michoacan holds mayoral elections in december the people of 
cheran will have another chance to go to the polls

several months after floods devastated west 
virginia in november 1985 and left thousands homeless the states 
senators pleaded with the department of housing and urban 
development for federal housing money the answer was no 
at the same time nevada sen paul laxalt president reagans 
close friend sought funds to upgrade aging apartments in reno the 
answer was yes 
the contrast is instructive of the way hud was run during the 
reagan administration if you were wellconnected to the president 
or had friends in high administration posts hud funds were 
generally available but not even the senate democratic leader 
robert byrd could shake loose money to help homeless flood victims 
in his home state of west virginia 
the november flood devastation greatly exacerbated the 
alreadyexisting need for housing help byrd wrote 
west virginias junior senator democrat jay rockefeller 
reminded hud of its responsibilities to no avail as you know all 
funds and units provided by the congress for your agencys programs 
are intended to be distributed on a fair share basis he wrote 
june 5 1986 hud secretary samuel r pierce responded that fair 
share distribution was no longer the rule 
laxalt wrote on june 16 1986 seeking money for owners of 
multifamily rental properties to upgrade older apartments a 
month later pierce provided funding for 100 apartments in october 
another 150 units were approved 
a parade of lawmakers has leaned on hud for federal funds to send 
back home as an easy way to win support from constituents some 
fared better than others in an associated press review of requests 
sent to hud between 1984 and 1987 
while many of the hud replies carried pierces signature they 
actually were signed by a machine at the instruction of deborah gore 
dean a special assistant to pierce who emerged as one of the most 
powerful people in the department even though her position carried 
little official authority 
ms dean is at the center of a congressional investigation of 
alleged influencepeddling at the department where former hud 
officials or wellconnected and highly paid republican consultants 
steered scarce federal funds to housing projects they owned or 
represented 
congressional correspondence to the hud office from 1984 to 1987 
showed legislators requesting funds for housing projects that ranged 
from homes for battered women to owners of multifamily rental 
properties 
a 1987 virginia request serves as a typical example of how 
congress members were involved 
steve smith commanding officer of the salvation army in 
alexandria va sent a letter feb 10 1987 to sen paul trible 
rva saying that approval of hud funds would make it possible 
for over 300 lowincome families to remain in arlandria an 
alexandria neighborhood and provide labor for lowincome paying 
positions in restaurants stores for office and blue collar 
workers 
trible in turn wrote to pierce asking for the funds pierce 
responded that every consideration would be given to the request 
democratic rep frederick boucher of virginia asked hud in 1985 
to approve a proposal by bampw associates of radford va to 
rehabilitate 152 housing units for the elderly in altoona pa the 
housing secretary responded with a threeparagraph letter saying 
we regret to inform you that it is unlikely that it will be funded 
this year 
in contrast sen william l armstrong rcolo received funding 
for proposals that included a project for handicapped tenants in 
greeley colo 
even some republicans had trouble at times winning funds 
in 1985 republican pennsylvania sen john heinz wrote to pierce 
complaining about the handling of his states requests 
pierce replied it is unfortunate that only 12 units could be 
allocated to pennsylvania in fiscal year 1985 however 
consideration had to be given to areas which received little or no 
funding in prior fiscal years pierce noted that money was 
available for 5000 units nationwide 
heinz resubmitted his request in january 1986 and was told in a 
letter that 10000 units were available for that fiscal year and his 
request would be considered 
most of pierces letters to the congress members cited the lack 
of available funding as the reason for rejections

more innocent bystanders are being shot and 
killed at crime scenes in four major cities according to a study 
that says criminals show a growing contempt for accidental 
victims 
fortyone innocent bystanders were reported shot in new york los 
angeles washington and boston in 1986 and 20 of them died in 1988 
that number leaped to 135 shot and 37 killed according to a study 
by lawrence w sherman a university of maryland professor of 
criminology 
overall in those three years 250 innocent bystanders were shot 
of whom 71 were killed and 179 wounded 
homicide in america is becoming more barbaric sherman said 
we may not expect honor among thieves but we do expect some honor 
among killers the growing contempt for accidental victims is even 
indicated by he name killers give them mushrooms who pop up in 
the line of fire 
the compilation of information differed for the four cities but 
the study found that new york city had more bystanders shot 128 
in 19861988 than the other three los angeles was second with 105 
in the same threeyear period while washington had 11 and boston 
had six 
on a per capita basis the study found los angeles has twice as 
many bystander shootings as new york 
the study scheduled to appear in the december 1989 journal of 
quantitative criminology was based on published indexes to the new 
york times the los angeles times and the washington post and a 
computerized search of the boston globe 
smiley ashton of the justice departments bureau of justice 
statistics said his agency does not keep track of such incidents and 
that the way they did it is probably the only way that it could be 
done 
sherman acknowledged in the study that a more thorough method for 
studying the trends would be to review narrative reports filed on 
homicides and aggravated assaults but said the review of newspaper 
accounts is the most efficient method even though there is a 
danger that press accounts would tend to suppress any increase in 
bystander shootings 
while bystander deaths still account for less than 1 percent of 
homicides in the cities reviewed a transformation of street crime 
from a phenomenon of individually intended victims to one of 
accidental or chance victims is a frightening prospect the study 
says 
it demonstrates that criminals no longer follow the rules of 
combat we expect them to follow limiting violence to intended 
targets and not recklessly endangering innocent bystanders the 
study says 
the study also found that in new york and los angeles most 
bystanders reported shot were victims of random shootings into 
crowds while in washington and boston more were victims of single 
stray bullets striking a lone individual the lower incidence of 
bystander shootings in the last two cities is attributable to this 
difference the study said 
among the possible reasons cited for the increase were more 
disputes over drug deals more guns in circulation and a trend 
toward generalizing anger from one person to an entire group the 
study did not address whether increased use of semiautomatic weapons 
had any impact on the number of bystanders shot 
the study was supported by the nonprofit crime control institute

nearly a month and a half after congress 
whisked through a 117 trillion budget for fiscal 1990 the pace of 
implementing the plan is slackening and its weakest links show signs 
of unraveling 
pivotal lawmakers voice optimism that by the oct 1 start of the 
new fiscal year the package of spending and deficitcutting bills 
needed to implement the budget will be in place 
the goal is a projected shortfall below the 100 billion target 
mandated in the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
but questions remain about where 53 billion in new tax receipts 
sought in the fiscal blueprint will come from 
also unclear is how and even whether some of the rest of 28 
billion in savings claimed in the budget will be achieved at all 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house 
budget committee complained last week to a reporter that some 
committees view cuts with a jaundiced eye and a cavalier manner i 
think well have difficulty with some of them 
the overall budget resolution for fiscal 1990 was approved may 
18 the earliest date in a decade 
but lawmakers now must approve other bills to carry out the 
budget thirteen measures disperse money among federal agencies and 
another contains new taxes and spending cuts 
the work on those 14 bills has gone slowly and though oct 1 
seems far off congress generous summer recesses leave it with only 
about eight weeks of work left until then 
the house last week approved one of the 13 spending bills an 
185 billion measure for science and water programs house leaders 
hope to complete the other 12 by the end of the first week in 
august the senate has not begun to consider any of the spending 
bills 
last year the house had completed all 13 spending measures by 
june 30 and the senate had disposed of four 
problems are arising however as lawmakers put together a plan 
for cutbacks in medicare farm initiatives and other benefit 
programs 
some of the savings are easy congress will save 17 billion by 
simply declaring that the moneylosing postal service is considered 
offbudget 
other choices are tougher such as the need to find 53 billion 
in new tax collections 
house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski considered 
agreeing to a cut in the capital gains tax sought by president bush 
who contends it would increase government collections by stimulating 
the economy 
but the illinois democrat abandoned that idea last week and said 
he will instead tinker with a number of narrow tax provisions such 
as halting a tax break that encourages banks to lend money to 
developing countries 
it is unclear how such a tax package would be treated by bush 
who has promised to reject any new taxes this year 
rostenkowskis panel also last week approved nearly 3 billion 
worth of reductions in the growth of the medicare program for the 
elderly 
but decisions by a host of other house committees remain to be 
made among them are requirements for the post office and civil 
service committee and the agriculture committee to each save 11 
billion the veterans affairs panel to slash 666 million and the 
merchant marine committee to find 200 million in cuts 
weve been doing this for eight years and weve cut all the 
easy stuff said one committee aide asking to not be identified 
were down to muscle and bones 
a crucial hurdle looms july 15 when the white houses office of 
management and budget collects data on the economy a slow economy 
boosts the deficit by cutting tax collections and increasing the 
governments tab for unemployment and other support programs this 
could require congress to find even more budget savings than 
anticipated to reach the 100 billion deficit target

the nozyk synagogue was filled with song 
and laughter but also painful memories as what remains of warsaws 
oncevital jewish community witnessed the citys first synagogue 
wedding since world war ii 
the groom robert blum of new york and his polishborn bride 
joanna kan were married sunday beneath a marriage canopy that had to 
be borrowed from the staterun jewish theater 
surrounded by television cameras the groom broke a glass and the 
synagogue erupted in multilingual good wishes 
but behind the festive cheer at warsaws lone synagogue was the 
memory of the more than 3 million polish jews killed by the nazis 
and the destruction of part of the nations culture 
we used to have eight weddings every sunday said a guest 
new york businessman and concentration camp survivor jack eisner as 
he pointed to the balcony where he sang in the choir as a boy in 
prewar warsaw 
fewer than 300000 polish jews survived the war and emigration 
has reduced that number to less than 10000 most of them elderly 
jews 
in warsaw alone there were 380000 jews before the 1939 german 
occupation more than in any other city except new york 
there were also 400 synagogues in the capital the sole remaining 
one used as a stable by the nazis was not rebuilt until 1983 and 
had not been used for a wedding since 
nor had there been a rabbi until the arrival about six weeks ago 
of menachen joskowitz a polish concentration camp survivor who came 
from israel for a twoyear stay 
theres no heart left theres only one synagogue a 
brokendown community mostly of old people said blum who lives 
in manhattan 
when we saw what was happening here we thought this would be 
the greatest way to add meaning to our wedding it came from our 
heart 
ms kan was catholic like more than 93 percent of polands 
population until she converted to judaism after moving to the 
united states from warsaw six years ago she met blum while working 
as a temporary employee at the new york firm of fulbright jaworski 
amp reavis mcgrath where blum practices corporate law 
blum said the couple was saddened by the synagogue when they 
traveled to poland last year to meet ms kans family 
all of my jewish education did not prepare me for what you see 
here he recalled we thought this is the last generation of 
jews in poland considering their history here it is very sad 
blum said he hopes the wedding festivities will help rejuvenate 
the jewish community in poland he said he had found that some 
younger jews are coming out of the woodwork to rediscover their 
religious roots 
it feels different here in the synagogue than it did six months 
ago blum said 
there is still much uncertainty about antisemitism in poland 
however 
an officially inspired antisemitic purge in 1968 following 
campus protests prompted most of the remaining jews to leave in 
recent years there has been official and private reflection on 
poles attitudes toward jews during and after the war 
there is a certain amount of underlying tension said 
mitchell blank a boyhood friend of blum from new york 
prior to the wedding there was a lastminute hunt for yarmulkes 
in a synagogue unaccustomed to a crowd of more than 200 it included 
two dozen family members and friends from the united states more 
from poland several jewish youth groups on tours from abroad and 
members of warsaws jewish community which had received an open 
invitation

americans believe that hollywoods golden age is 
gone victim of the videocassette recorder and the movie industrys 
own excesses 
even as the summers blockbusters smash boxoffice records a 
majority in a media generalassociated press poll gave unfavorable 
reviews to most new films and most said the overall quality of 
movies has been declining 
three reasons were sex violence and profanity overwhelming 
majorities said most new movies have too much of each and most of 
the 1084 adults in the poll said they prefer not to attend such 
films 
ticket prices were another complaint while threequarters of 
respondents paid 5 or less for their last ticket a sizable 45 
percent said the price was unreasonable moreover six in 10 of the 
most avid moviegoers those under 30 years old said ticket prices 
were too high 
many film critics say hollywood reached its pinnacle a 
halfcentury ago when the years new flims included gone with the 
wind the wizard of oz and wuthering heights but it is 
this summers hits batman indiana jones and the last 
crusade and ghostbusters ii that have set ticketsale 
records in their opening weeks 
despite such popular new fare the poll found that americans 
watch movies on home videocasette recorders far more often than they 
go to the theater and half of vcr owners said they go out to movies 
less since buying their machines 
ten percent of all respondents said they had gone out to a movie 
in the previous week a third said they had rented a movie cassette 
in the previous week to watch on a home vcr 
the same pattern held over time just 3 percent reported visiting 
a movie theater more than 30 times in the previous year but 25 
percent said they had rented a movie for their home vcr more than 30 
times in the year 
in all 75 percent said they owned a vcr 
the polls reviews were not all bad for the film industry six in 
10 gave favorable marks to the last movie they had seen but about 
as many had an unfavorable impression of new movies in general 
criticism of content was extraordinarily high with eight in 10 
saying most new films have too much violence and too much profanity 
and seven in 10 saying most new movies have too much nudity 
women were considerably more critical than were men strong 
majorities of women said they would be less likely to attend a film 
if it contained nudity violence or profanity most men by 
contrast said those factors would not matter in their choice of a 
movie 
seventyseven percent of women said if a movie were violent they 
would be less likely to see it but just 41 percent of men agreed 
on profanity the femalemale split was 6944 on nudity 7242 
older respondents also were much more critical of content and 
movie attendance declined with age respondents under age 45 were 
much more frequent moviegoers than those over 45 
fiftysix percent overall said the quality of movies has been 
getting worse that sentiment ranged from 42 percent of the youngest 
group to 76 percent of the oldest and from 48 percent of men to 64 
percent of women 
similarly 27 percent overall rated most new movies as poor 
and 34 percent rated them only fair an unfavorable review by 61 
percent on the favorable side 31 percent rated the movies good 
and just 3 percent said excellent the few others had no opinion 
respondents who identified themselves as liberals were more 
tolerant of profanity and nudity in the movies although they 
objected to violence as much as others 
the poll conducted may 513 had a margin of sampling error of 3 
percentage points

over the last two centuries there have been 
10393 attempts to amend the us constitution and only 26 successes 
president bush isnt bothered by those odds as he presses for an 
amendment to protect the stars and stripes from destruction by 
political protesters 
the president says hes outraged over the supreme courts 
decision permitting flag burning as an acceptable if unattractive 
expression of the free speech guaranteed by the first amendment 
bush wants a 27th amendment permitting congress and the states to 
pass laws banning the desecration of old glory 
a check of the records shows that more attempts are being made 
now than ever before to change the constitution with actual changes 
just as infrequent as ever 
no change has been made since the 26th amendment giving 
18yearolds the vote was ratified 18 years ago 
in the first hundred years 17891889 1736 proposed 
amendments to the constitution were filed with congress 
from 1963 until the house adjourned last thursday 5001 
amendments have been offered 
those figures include of course multiple submissions of the 
same ideas and repeat filings congress after congress after 
congress 
about two dozen resolutions have been filed in the house and 
senate to forbid flag desecration since the supreme court handed 
down its decision on june 21 
such an amendment would have to be approved by the house and 
senate by twothirds majorities the amendment would be ratified and 
made part of the constitution only with the approval of 
threefourths of the 50 states 
the difficulty of hurdling the barriers erected by the 
constitutions authors have not kept people from trying 
former president reagan campaigned for eight years for an 
amendment to require a balanced federal budget as a private 
citizen he is campaigning still 
reagan also wanted an amendment allowing a president to lineitem 
veto individual sections of appropriations bills instead of dealing 
with them on an allornothing basis he didnt get that either at 
least not yet 
president bush now has endorsed four amendments to the 
constitution flag desecration antiabortion balanced budget and 
lineitem veto 
the equal rights amendment forbidding discrimination based on sex 
was first introduced in 1923 congress finally approved it in 1972 
and sent it to the states for ratification its highwater mark to 
date came in 1982 when the number of states voting to ratify reached 
35 three states short of the required 38 
proposed amendments are pending in various forms to ban busing to 
achieve racial balance in schools to set a single sixyear term for 
the president to set terms for house members at four years to 
forbid abortion to make the district of columbia the 51st state to 
make english the official language of the united states and to 
permit prayer in public schools 
other ideas floated over the last 20 years or so include 
requiring a threefifths vote for congress to borrow money 
requiring a twothirds vote to approve appropriations and budgets 
abolishing the income tax and limiting congressional immunity for 
traffic offenses 
until now the hurdles have proven too steep for all of the above 
but one of the earliest proposed amendments it appeared to have 
died on the vine early in the 19th century is showing new signs of 
life because of 20th century controversy over congressional pay 
raises 
drafted by james madison and submitted to the first congress it 
states no law varying the compensation for the service of the 
senators and representatives shall take effect until an election of 
representatives shall have intervened 
its effect would be to give the voters a chance to retaliate 
before a legislative pay raise takes effect 
congress approved the proposition on sept 25 1789 and sent it 
to the states only six states voted to ratify until a drive began 
a few years ago to breathe new life into it 
in recent years five additional states have voted to ratify it 
that brings the total after two centuries to 11 and holds out at 
least a slim chance that madisons idea may someday become a part of 
the constitution

teachers must reject reaction and act as a 
constructive force in school reform according to outgoing national 
education association president mary hatwood futrell 
the nea was choosing a new president today to take over when 
futrell steps down at the end of the summer after six years at the 
helm of the 2millionmember union 
running to succeed futrell were union vice president keith geiger 
of michigan and executive committee member john wilson of north 
carolina 
i am still mary the teacher the departing nea president told 
8400 delegates sunday at the annual nea representative assembly 
remember me as someone who has chalk dust on the sleeves of 
her soul 
dont rain on the parade of educational reform lead it she 
urged in her final speech 
we must embrace change and reject reaction she said we 
must continue to expand politically and professionally as we have 
over the last 20 years especially the last five years we must 
push hard we must take risks we must never let up 
as the nations largest union and one of its most politically 
active the nea has considerable clout both in washington and at the 
grassroots level 
of the two candidates geiger was generally considered more 
moderate and likely to continue on the course set by futrell while 
wilson promised passionate leadership with no bows to public opinion 
geiger in accepting his nomination sunday described himself as 
an experienced collective bargainer who would be tough but 
flexible as president 
you deserve a president who will confront issues squarely but 
will never confuse confrontation with results geiger told the 
delegates your next president must know when to stand firm and 
when to bend how to recognize necessary and legitimate reform and 
how to recognize political posturing 
wilson vowed to teach politicians and corporate leaders that we 
deserve good pay for the work we do and we shouldnt have to jump 
through a lot of hoops to get it 
he attacked merit pay as wrong and divisive and pledged to do 
everything in my power to defeat it he also attacked 
educational bureaucrats who stand in our path to reform by 
piling on paperwork and cutting back budgets 
both candidates praised futrell and echoed her theme of teacher 
empowerment geiger told the delegates that you must play the key 
roles in deciding how your schools are run while wilson said he 
will not rest until the classrooms of the future are shaped by 
those who work in them 
in a speech interrupted more than 60 times by applause and 
standing ovations futrell spoke on broad issues ranging from gun 
control to the global economy to subjects specifically affecting 
children and education 
she said the nea must stand firm in its opposition to vouchers 
tuition tax credits and halfbaked suggestions from the elitists 
the politically ambitious and the educationally inexperienced 
but futrell exhorted the union once labeled the status quo 
incarnate by former education secretary william bennett to be a 
constructive force in school reform 
futrell said systemwide restructuring must be conceived and 
executed by educators and that nea should take the lead 
she also reiterated nea calls for full funding of federal 
education health and nutrition programs for disadvantaged children 
she scolded president bush for failing to accept an invitation to 
speak to the group whose membership is about onethird republican

traffic here has gotten so bad that officials 
are discussing using the 500 miles of flood control channels as 
parttime freeways 
promoters think los angeles countys concrete waterways are a 
congestion reliever detractors say if you see aqua duck 
its an idea that has surfaced from time to time during the past 
20 years always to be scuttled because of better options says jim 
sims director of transportation programs for the county 
transportation department 
now were at the point that we may be running out of 
attractive alternatives and we may be at the point where we could 
live with something we cant use all the time sims said 
in the past it hasnt been shown to be feasible said kathy 
delegal spokeswoman for the countys department of public works 
which maintains the channels but traffic congestion has worsened 
so it should be looked at again she said were openminded 
all agree that traffic in los angeles county is on the brink of 
busting through its barriers of the 10 busiest freeway interchanges 
in the united states six are in the county and two are in 
neighboring orange county according to the state department of 
transportation 
the nations busiest interchange is the west los angeles junction 
of the santa monica and san diego freeways used by about 513000 
vehicles daily 
the los angeles county transportation commissions newly approved 
budget includes 100000 for a feasibility study on channel 
conversions the study is to be completed early next year and will 
focus only on engineering and hydrology 
environmental concerns safety and other barriers would be 
considered if the engineering feasibility is positive sims said 
for example the impact of an oil or diesel fuel spill on the harbor 
most be reviewed 
one of the channels targeted for possible conversion is the los 
angeles river largely paved over in the 1950s it starts where the 
calabasas and bell creeks come together in the san fernando valley 
passes east of downtown and heads to the harbor ms delegal said 
in sections it ranges from 45 feet to 160 feet across and is 
between 30 and 40 feet deep she said 
the channel often is used by police and the rapid transit 
district for driver training movie studios use it for location 
shooting 
they like it for car chases said jean granucci of the 
department of public works 
sims said the channels would be used by specialized 
transportation trucks car pools or van pools obviously it 
wouldnt be usable 365 days a year he said 
deputy mayor mike gage called the concept ludicrous and said 
mayor tom bradley would prefer to see the channels used for rafting 
and swimming 
state assemblyman richard katz criticized bradley for rejecting 
the idea so quickly 
unlike people at city hall i dont profess to know the answers 
until i get the facts he said the whole point of the study is 
to find out what will work 
sims said ramps with gates would have to be built for the 
parttime freeways and plans devised to clear people out when it 
rains 
knxam traffic reporter bill keene likes the idea its great 
if the weather stays decent he said he suggested the waterways 
be turned over to trucks since they are responsible for 33 percent 
of our accidents and 66 percent of our major tieups 
but the flood control channel conversion is not the ultimate 
answer sims cautioned we are trying to look at every idea we can 
to reduce congestion including ideas that havent been thought of 
before 
among the other options authorities have studied are doubledeck 
freeways commuter and metro rails and invehicle television 
screens that show congestion and suggest alternate routes

the nations farm economy is in its third year 
of recovery and an agriculture department analyst says no serious 
downturn is likely in the next few years 
greg hanson of the departments economic research service says 
us agriculture has shown a strong recovery from the early 1980s 
since the start of 1987 farm incomes and finances have 
rebounded more strongly than anticipated he said net cash 
income is projected to average 56 billion annually during 
198789 about 10 billion higher than the 198486 average while 
debt fell more than 10 percent in 198788 
farm exports have rebounded by 40 percent since the mid1980s 
and there has been a reduction of 33 billion bushels in the us 
stockpile of corn wheat and soybeans 
higher prices brought about by lower stocks and strong export 
demand likely will extend the financial recovery through the end of 
1989 and into 1990 hansen said in the july issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine 
but how solid is the recovery the 1980s began with a bloated 
cost structure that was a precondition for the ensuing financial 
crisis he said will farmers avoid a repetition in the 1990s 
hanson hedges a bit noting that there are many factors beyond 
the control of individual farmers global weather patterns 
multilateral trade negotiations and currency exchange rates for 
example 
but he also notes that many fundamentals of the farm economy are 
stronger and that agriculture is now a growth industry 
crop sales receipts have increased 23 percent and livestock 
sales 12 percent since 1986 with farm output expected to be 
slightly higher this year than in the mid1980s 
capital investment is up onethird with spending on new 
tractors machinery and buildings expected to be about 3 billion 
more than in 1986 
farm real estate values are forecast up onesixth since 1986 
with land values rising slightly faster than inflation this year 
hanson said the reduced stockpile of commodities and a growing 
demand for those products undergird current sales strength and 
investment growth in us agriculture longterm factors suggest 
that supply will not soon dwarf demand and that farmers will not 
soon experience another deep financial crisis like the one in the 
mid1980s 
one reason for optimism he said is the conservation reserve 
program which will idle 30 million or more acres a year through the 
mid1990s under longterm agreements with farmers to protect fragile 
crop land the goal actually is 40 million to 45 million acres 
comparatively an average of 23 million acres were idled between 
1979 and 1985 
a cheaper us dollar bodes well for farm exports hanson said 
one dollar bought about 40 percent less german and japanese currency 
in 198789 than in 198485 
this makes us exports more competitive with european 
producers and us farm commodities cheaper for japanese 
consumers he said given the continuing us trade and budget 
deficits it is not likely that the dollar will rebound for an 
extended period to mid1980 levels 
another hopeful sign is the improved state of farm finances 
hanson said between 1985 and 1988 the number of commercial farmers 
with annual sales of at least 40000 who faced loan default 
declined by about 50 percent to 60000 
farm debt also fell by 45 billion over a sixyear period 
putting producers in a much stronger financial position than in the 
mid1980s 
this provides a cushion that will enable most farmers to 
withstand one or more years of reduced profits should agricultural 
growth slow or stall in the next few years he said 
another factor is difficult to judge but its there farmers are 
survivors 
todays farmers have survived a costprice squeeze and the 
financial problems brought about by landvalue deflation after debt 
tripled in the 1970s hanson said they have survived all the 
business problems of a major crisis and in the process have learned 
valuable lessons 
for example he said record net cash incomes in 1986 1987 and 
1988 tended to be used conservatively to pay down debt and make 
needed investments and improvements 
while land values and investments have rebounded from 1986 low 
marks farm debt continued to fall in 1988 and is forecast to be 
stable in 1989 up to 75 percent of this debt reduction is from 
farmers paying off loans not loan losses 
farmers likely will continue to avoid an overinvestment 
trap hanson said there is heightened awareness of the 
longterm importance of daily cost control and sound management 
he added this is an intangible factor that is as important as 
higher commodity prices lower stocks more competitive exchange 
rates and less financial stress 
lest he appear too rosy about the future hanson said a number of 
things could happen to cloud the situation 
recurrence of a costprice squeeze could be one of the threats 
along with continued heavy reliance on government payments lower 
profits in the livestock sector unsuccessful trade negotiations or 
major scientific breakthroughs that could cause lower prices

eastern airlines has nearly tripled its flights in a 
move that was met with outrage from union workers who have been on 
strike against the carrier for four months 
fly cheap die cheap about 100 striking pilots yelled sunday 
at the first eastern passengers to fly out of fort lauderdale since 
the strike began 
our purpose is to get the public aware of our problems and to 
let them know we are still on strike said robert fay a pilot for 
32 years were not here for greed were here on principle 
in san francisco one of the cities where service resumed 300 
striking machinists and pilots formed a line passengers had to push 
through 
at hartsfield atlanta international airport passengers crowded 
easterns gates 
it gives you an uneasy feeling to walk across a picket line 
said jeff handler who passed through hartsfield on his way from 
sarasota to greenville sc he noted his tickets cost 79 each way 
much less than fares of competing airlines 
such is life he said smiling as he made his way through the 
crowded concourse 
in all eastern increased its scheduled daily flights to 225 from 
80 serving 49 cities instead of 27 the move was in line with a 
rebuilding plan the carrier has submitted to us bankruptcy court 
eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization march 9 five days after 
the strike began 
also sunday continental airlines which like eastern is also 
owned by texas air corp announced 76 oneway fares on us 
flights for three days following the fourth of july holiday united 
airlines plans to match the offer said united spokesman joseph 
hopkins 
before the machinists union strike miamibased eastern operated 
1040 daily flights to 102 cities and had 30000 employees 
currently eastern is operating with about 8000 employees 
including 300 pilots who did not honor the strike and 150 new pilots 
recruited and trained since the strike began about 550 other pilots 
are in training and a recruiting drive continues said eastern 
spokesman robin matell said 
by december eastern plans to reach its goal of 800 flights a day 
serving 77 cities matell said 
everything is going as planned were right on target to come 
back strong he said 
the only thing you might notice is some gray hair in the 
cockpit matell said noting the average age of its new hires is 
about 40 these guys are older and they have more experience 
air line pilots association spokesman ld williams said 
easterns decision to increase its flights is unsafe because of the 
shortage of qualified pilots 
theyre not able to get enough qualified people to replace us 
and theyre not going to be around for the amount of time it takes 
to do that williams said they have lowered their standards 
they are desperate for pilots 
matell said passenger traffic on the new flights has been strong 
weve been offering comeback fares real bargains and the 
public has been gobbling them up the spokesman said 
houstonbased continental is offering the 76 oneway fare on all 
of the carriers flights in the us mainland where seats are 
available for trips beginning thursday friday or saturday 
continentals sale fare requires no advance purchase but it must 
be bought within 24 hours of the time the reservation is made 
travelers may return as early as sunday or can stay as long as they 
like

president bush says hes sorry adm william j 
crowe jr has decided to retire this fall as chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff 
he did an outstanding job and is doing an outstanding job and 
very candidly id like to have had him stay the president told 
reporters at his family home in kennebunkport maine after crowe 
announced his retirement plans on sunday 
crowe interviewed on nbctvs meet the press said i am 
going to retire i have not said that before publicly 
the military chief said he will retire on sept 30 at the end of 
his second twoyear term as chairman 
crowe was appointed to the post in october 1985 by thenpresident 
reagan and was reappointed in september 1987 crowe 64 had 
reportedly been urged by bush for months to spend another two years 
in the post 
crowe also said sunday that despite the change afoot in the 
soviet union an agreement soon on reducing the two superpowers 
longrange nuclear arsenals is unlikely 
my own instincts are that it will require protracted 
negotiations said crowe who recently returned from an 11day 
tour of soviet military facilities 
crowe said there is no question that the climate for negotiations 
has improved between the recess last fall of the ussoviet 
strategic arms reduction talks and their resumption in geneva 
earlier this month 
but the same fundamental issues that have plagued us are still 
there he said we have some very difficult questions on 
accounting rules we start from different baselines on practically 
every question that we address the devil is in the details 
general principles dont hack it 
crowe said his trip to the soviet union did not alter his basic 
view on ussoviet relations even though he acknowledged the 
changes taking place there are the biggest event during his tenure 
as top us military officer 
we should move warily and carefully exploiting opportunities 
as they present themselves but we should be very deliberate in our 
own actions and take steps as the horizon clears not prematurely 
he said 
crowe said he is concerned that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev has underestimated the difficulties in switching his 
countrys priorities from a military to a domestic economic footing

the rebel group that for 23 years fought 
for independence from south africa has opened namibias election 
campaign with a generally conciliatory stance toward the territorys 
white minority 
in announcing its platform on sunday the southwest africa 
peoples organization known as swapo also pledged to improve the 
lot of the impoverished black majority and to champion socialism 
swapo does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of 
socialism over capitalism the groups campaign manifesto said 
with banners waving about 25000 people almost all black 
attended swapos first official campaign event sunday in the 
fourmonth campaign for elections that are to lead to independence 
this is the beginning of victory swapo spokesman danny 
tjongarero told the crowd at a community center in katutura a black 
township outside windhoek the capital 
swapos platform is generally kind to opposition groups such as 
the 75000 whites who make up just 6 percent of the population but 
own the majority of private land and businesses 
no wholesale nationalization of the mines land and other 
productive sectors is envisaged in the foreseeable future said 
hage geingob the leader of swapos election campaign 
in the election swapo is widely favored to win the most votes 
and possibly the twothirds majority needed to control the writing 
of a new constitution 
sundays crowd dressed in the red blue and green colors of 
swapo frequently broke into song and chants of swapo must win 
many supporters wore tshirts with the face of swapo leader sam 
nujoma who has yet to return from more than 20 years in exile 
despite the pledges against nationalization swapos platform 
also advocates a strong government role in shaping and controlling 
the economy 
geingob said the organizations main objectives were to close the 
gap between wealthy whites and impoverished blacks and to upgrade 
basic services such as education health care and housing 
he did not say where the money would come from 
south africa which has provided up to 25 percent of the 
territorys 700 million budget in recent years says it will cease 
its aid when the territory gains independence probably early next 
year 
the south africans who have ruled namibia since 1915 agreed to 
grant independence under a peace plan signed in december with cuba 
and angola 
the usbrokered accord calls for cuba to withdraw its 50000 
soldiers from angola where they have been supporting the marxist 
government the cuban pullout has been proceeding on schedule and 
last month angola and the usbacked rebels there agreed to a 
ceasefire in their 14year civil war 
swapo said it did not want to create a oneparty communist state 
it called for a democratic state with a bill of rights that would 
guarantee freedom of religion in the mostly christian territory of 
13 million people 
it did not say whether it would tolerate political opposition and 
press freedom 
swapos main political rival the democratic turnhalle alliance 
says it fears swapo will crack down on opposition groups if it gains 
power the alliance is a multiracial coalition that favors a 
multiparty democracy and a marketoriented economy 
swapo draws its strongest support from the ovambo people of 
northern namibia and also has a solid base in windhoek 
political parties have been campaigning for several weeks but

loans by the world bank to third world 
countries now at a record level are expected to keep escalating in 
the next year bank officials say 
the world bank the biggest source of aid to the third world 
countries announced sunday that its loans had reached a record 
219 billion in the year that ended friday up from 192 billion 
the year before 
bank vice president moeen qureshi predicted the total will be 
about 175 billion higher in the year to come 
this years figure would have been higher if the board of 
executive directors representing the united states and 150 other 
member governments had approved 780 million worth of loans 
scheduled for china in june world bank president barber conable a 
former new york state congressman deferred the matter after the 
violent chinese crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing 
then president bush asked for a delay 
the united states is the largest contributor to the world bank 
qureshi a pakistani called the events in china very 
distressing 
the situation is going back to normal insofar as the 
implementation of bank projects is concerned he told reporters 
he added that the delay in loans to china was not a sanction 
against that country the loans will be reconsidered later in 
consultation with the chinese government one of the members he 
said 
the bank is supposed to make decisions on economic grounds and 
work on a business basis 
qureshi estimated that last year the bank got back about 1 
billion more in repayments and interest than it loaned out and 35 
billion the year before qureshi said this years figures include 
prepayments of 14 billion from romania 700 million by south 
korea and 400 million by thailand without those repayments the 
bank would have paid more than it took in 
though romania is one of europes poorest countries president 
nicolae ceausescu announced in april the completion of an eightyear 
program of paying off the countrys 11 billion foreign debt south 
korea and thailand are among the pacific rim countries of asia which 
have been increasingly prosperous

one thousand officers from the florida panhandle to the keys 
arrested 2000 people on charges of using or dealing crack and 
police in los angeles arrested more than 400 people in antigang 
sweeps 
many of the florida suspects were nabbed by undercover officers 
posing as dealers while others were captured in raids and dramatic 
foot chases 
many also were back on the street within hours 
after the 48hour roundup ended early sunday officers counted 
2076 arrests in addition to the arrests they seized 3500 rocks 
of crack cocaine 327 vehicles more than 55000 in cash nearly 10 
pounds of powdered cocaine and 50 firearms 
its gone way above our expectations said broward county 
sheriff nick navarro who organized operation rock pile 
believed to be the largest coordinated effort against streetlevel 
drug users and dealers 
at some places saturday night authorities were taking in 
suspects at the rate of 100 an hour with more than a third of the 
arrests in south florida 
the florida sheriffs association plans to meet later this month 
to plan more large drug sweeps said al gordon broward sheriffs 
spokesman 
look how much crack we took in it shows these type of 
operations work you can expect more gordon said 
gang members were the targets of the police sweeps in los 
angeles part of a continuing operation hammer which began last 
summer of the 412 people arrested authorities said 221 were gang 
members 
but a religious leader said a bill that was enacted last year and 
allows police to designate particular gangs as criminal doesnt go 
far enough the rev carl washington urged state lawmakers to revise 
the bill so that anyone can be charged for belonging to a gang 
theres no such thing as a gang for social gathering 
washington said sunday evening 
gangs were believed to be the cause of violence that erupted 
saturday during a sixhour soul concert at the los angeles memorial 
coliseum nearly 250 officers assigned to the sweeps were diverted 
to the arena when warring gangs stabbed three people and fired shots 
at others said detective tony celli 
details of the disturbance were unavailable from police although 
a los angeles times review of the concert said hundreds of skittish 
people ran for exits as fights broke out on the field 
the florida crackdown involved 67 sheriffs offices and several 
police departments 
i am delighted with it said volusia county sheriff bob 
vogel were attacking both ends supply and demand 
vogel who has gained notoriety for seizing suspected drug money 
from interstate motorists near daytona beach said the statewide 
effort will be repeated until streetlevel buyers and sellers get 
this message if you sell crack cocaine or purchase crack cocaine 
youre going to jail 
many of the suspects were charged with either cocaine possession 
or dealing and used bail bondsmen to post their 5000 to 10000 
bond 
authorities targeted highcrime urban areas but were surprised 
by the more than 400 arrests in the mostly rural panhandle 
it shows that crack is not just an urban problem said gordon 
the tactics used in the sweep particularly undercover stings 
raised concern with some civil rights groups 
anytime you have reverse stings with police used as a lure for 
drug users youre entering a very sensitive area said charleen 
carres legislative counsel for the florida chapter of the american 
civil liberties union in tallahassee 
the aclu is in favor of battling drugs but we dont feel 
peoples rights should be violated in the rush to stop drug 
traffic

with the rev martin luther king jrs grave as a 
backdrop black leaders marked the 25th anniversary of the civil 
rights act by urging president bush to back up his words with deeds 
and support affirmative action 
mr bush has got to get up and make the white house the right 
house said the rev joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference its not enough to talk that 
talk we need him to walk that walk 
the civil rights act which president johnson signed into law 
july 2 1964 banned segregation in public places and discrimination 
in the workplace 
lowery one of several rights leaders who met with bush on 
friday said recent us supreme court decisions against affirmative 
action programs have left blacks doubting whether the president 
would work to protect progress made under the law 
im going to remain hopeful for the time being lowery said 
mr bush has good instincts he wants to do whats right in this 
regard 
friday bush called on congress to reauthorize the civil rights 
commission which is set to expire nov 30 
attorney general dick thornburgh said last week the 
administration would not push congress to overturn the supreme court 
decisions which make it more difficult to prove discrimination in 
employment 
lowery said civil rights leaders are concerned that bush is 
paying lip service to their cause and added the president is 
going to have to make up his mind by either bolstering black 
membership in the gop or pleasing ultraconservatives 
lowery was joined at kings gravesite by rosa parks whose 
refusal to sit in a segregated section of a montgomery ala bus in 
1955 sparked the civil rights movement 
mrs parks said bushs statements sounded good but we are 
waiting for real real action 
about 200 people gathered for sundays prayer service during 
which lowery blasted supreme court justice sandra day oconnor for 
her position against affirmative action 
glory be to god if it werent for affirmative action shed 
still be in arizona presiding over a microwave lowery said 
adding that the american public should remind sandra who she is 
lowery scolded the crowd for not singing this little light of 
mine with enthusiasm saying that if civil rights leaders had 
sung with that kind of spirit during the movement we would 
still be in slavery 
the crowd responded by singing with threepart harmony

president bushs nomination of his chief 
political fundraiser to be us ambassador to luxembourg is in 
deep trouble because of the mans involvement in the housing and 
urban development scandal says senate republican leader bob dole 
i would guess it may be a while before he goes to luxembourg 
dole said sunday referring to frederick m bush who is no relation 
to the president but was finance director for both his 1980 and 1988 
presidential campaigns 
and if he goes it may just be as a visitor dole quipped 
speaking on cbs face the nation program 
frederick bush was questioned extensively last thursday and in 
may by the house government operations committee about hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in consultant fees which his lobbying firm 
bush amp co reaped in 1986 and 1987 for hud projects in puerto rico 
frederick bush acknowledged in his testimony that he had 
contacted political appointees at hud but he said he did not feel 
his campaign efforts on behalf of george bush or his job as deputy 
director of the vice presidents staff from 1982 to 1984 gave him 
political influence with hud officials

attorney general dick thornburgh says he has 
directed the justice department to compile a list of federal 
prisoners convicted of burning the us flag in anticipation that a 
recent supreme court decision will lead to their freedom 
if someone is entitled to relief then all are entitled to 
relief thornburgh said the courts 54 decision in a texas case 
said flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of political 
protest 
thornburgh said however that he doubted that more than a 
handful of federal prisoners are involved 
thornburgh made the comments on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley in response to a question about carlos mendozalugo a 
puerto rican nationalist now at the us penitentiary in atlanta 
mendozalugo who was given a oneyear prison sentence after 
pleading guilty to a federal charge of flag desecration last week 
filed a petition in us district court for his release 
my expectation is that he probably will be entitled to that 
relief thornburgh said of mendozalugo who burned a us flag 
two years ago in front of a us post office as a protest for puerto 
rican independence

and other vietnamese refugees from a small open boat in the stormy 
pacific 
now the newly naturalized us citizen who has taken the first 
name eugene from a character in a the novel look homeward 
angel is bound for the us naval academy 
he hopes to become a pilot a dream since he watched american 
planes streak over his saigon home but says he never considered 
joining the air force 
the navy rescued me if it hadnt been for that destroyer i 
would probably be dead nguyen 20 said in an interview just 
before independence day 
after saigon fell to the communists in 1975 the family moved to 
the coastal city of nha trang nguyens father who had served in 
the south vietnamese navy was sent to a reeducation camp 
intended to indoctrinate him in communist thought he wasnt 
released until 1982 
he and his father and a brother made several attempts to flee in 
small boats twice they were turned back by government ships and 
other times they were chased off the beach by gunfire 
finally in september 1983 the father and two sons made it to 
the open ocean with 35 other people in a fishing boat hoping to 
reach the philippines five days later they were picked up by a us 
destroyer nguyen remembers it well the uss benjamin stoddard 
the flag was what i saw first nguyen said i dont think i 
ever saw my father so happy 
nguyens mother a younger brother and a sister are still in nha 
trang 
the three refugees settled in the atlanta suburb of norcross and 
nguyen started eighth grade learning english along the way 
he did well at sequoyah high school especially in math he made 
the soccer team worked for the school newspaper and joined the beta 
club an honor society this spring he graduated fourth in his 
class of 350 
but after taking naval academy entrance exams two things stood 
in his way his height 5foot1 a quarterinch shy of the navy 
requirement and a mediocre verbal test score 
nguyen contacted sens sam nunn and wyche fowler of georgia for 
help fowlers committee on military academy appointments agreed to 
meet with him last november 
i was kind of scared about it if i failed that i wouldnt get 
another chance nguyen recalled 
fran weiss a fowler staffer said the youths eloquence and 
desire to serve the united states swayed committee members into 
nominating him the story that he told it moved us she said 
in may naval academy officials agreed to approve the appointment 
nguyen recalled that when he heard the news my head was just 
exploding it just went apart 
help from fowlers office also helped nguyen get a swearingin 
scheduled promptly after he first became eligible to become a us 
citizen last month on june 23 nguyen took the oath of allegiance 
to the united states and gave a speech to the 150 other new citizens 
i told them there couldnt be a greater title than the title of 
citizen of the united states he said 
nguyen becomes a midshipman this month and he plans to stay in 
the navy beyond the fiveyear service requirement after he is 
commissioned 
somebody picked me out of the ocean got me here educated me

the governing liberal democrats reeling from 
financial and sex scandals suffered a setback in tokyo elections 
viewed as a barometer for national elections later this month 
official results showed today 
of 128 seats in the tokyo metropolitan assembly the party won 43 
seats a loss of 20 in sundays vote and the japan socialist party 
increased its representation from 12 to 29 seats according to the 
tokyo board of elections 
also winning seats were seven independent candidates backed by 
the socialists the countrys largest opposition party 
opposition parties now hold a combined majority of 85 seats in 
the tokyo assembly in the outgoing 127member assembly they 
together held just one more seat than the liberal democrats 
the komei clean government party won 26 seats the japan 
communist party 14 seats and the democratic socialist party three 
seats four minor parties had one seat each and independent 
candidates not backed by the socialists captured two seats 
prime minister sousuke uno plagued by allegations he has kept a 
number of paid mistresses blamed an unpopular sales tax imposed 
april 1 for the liberal democrats setback 
uno the party president did not stump for liberal democrats at 
the request of the tokyo branch of the party 
a senior governing party official in tokyo shigeru kasuya told 
the nhk television network that the partys losses were partly due 
to skepticism about the liberal democrats campaign promise to 
consider doing away with the tax 
he said tokyo residents were suspicious of the partys true 
intention 
chief cabinet secretary masajuro shiokawa said voter distrust 
in politics led to the liberal democrats losses adding that the 
government will do its best to achieve political reforms and regain 
public confidence 
japan socialist party chairwoman takako doi told nhk our 
partys gains are a result of anger against the current political 
situation 
prominent in the oppositions campaign were criticisms of the 
liberal democrats for the new 3 percent tax the broad recruit 
influencepeddling scandal and unos alleged extramarital affairs 
news reports have cast doubt on whether uno premier for only one 
month will be in office by july 14 for the paris summit of 
industrial nations 
kyodo news service reported that representatives of several 
liberal democratic factions met late last week and agreed uno should 
resign as soon as possible for the benefit of the party 
uno has denied reports he will resign 
the recruit bribery scandal forced unos predecessor noboru 
takeshita to resign june 2 
soon after uno took over as premier a former geisha claimed in a 
published interview that uno paid her sex reports that uno kept 
other mistresses filled the press last week 
business leaders called the liberal democrats electoral losses 
serious and shocking eiji suzuki president of the japan federation 
of employers associations and others said the election was a sign 
the public had lost confidence in the probusiness liberal democrats 
although a local election the tokyo poll was dominated by 
national issues and considered a sign of how the liberal democrats 
who have governed japan since 1954 will fare in a national election 
for half the seats in the upper house of parliament on july 23 
the partys large majority in the more powerful lower house could 
also be challenged in elections later this year if parliament is 
dissolved over public discontent with the government 
shiokawa the governments chief spokesman said late last week 
that a lower house election might come before long 
about 518 million people or 587 percent of the total eligible 
voters cast their ballots sunday on a drizzly day up from 535 
percent in previous elections held in 1985 the tokyo board of 
elections said 
more than 61 percent of registered women voted compared with 56 
percent of men the board said 
of 33 women candidates for seats in the assembly enlarged to 128 
seats this year 17 won seats

the dollar fell against the japanese yen and the 
tokyo stock exchanges key index rose sharply today despite a big 
setback for japans governing liberal democratic party in tokyo 
elections 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which fell 762 
points last friday rose 28773 points or 087 percent closing at 
3323642 
the dollar closed at 14250 yen down 145 yen from fridays 
close of 14395 yen it opened at 14475 yen and fluctuated between 
14250 yen and 14490 yen 
the dollar rose in the morning on news that the opposition 
parties were pulling ahead in vote counting from sundays tokyo 
metropolitan election 
but it fell sharply in the afternoon confounding expectations 
that a defeat for the probusiness ldp would hurt the yen 
to a certain extent markets predicted last week that the ldp 
would be defeated from the ldp defeat in niigata parliamentary 
byelection and people bought dollars and sold yen said 
sumitomo banks toshiaki kakimoto 
people say that the market is unstable before you know the 
result but it quiets down once the result comes in he added in 
explanation of todays turnabout for the dollar 
kakimoto also said the bank of japan had intervened heavily 
selling an estimated 500 million to 600 million in the morning and 
another 200 million to 300 million in the afternoon 
the bank of japan forced the dollar down they seem to feel 
that the 140yen range is not favorable for the united states he 
said 
they also probably wanted to prevent the yen from going too 
low which might happen in overseas markets if the bank of japan 
decided not to intervene kakimoto added 
on the stock market an analyst at nomura securities who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said the markets may have been reacting 
positively to the ldps defeat 
the political issues didnt revolve around whether the ldp was 
bad or whether japanese democracy was no good rather they focused 
on common sense and morality issues he said 
with a humbler ldp government it may be possible to have 
discussions on whether for instance the consumption tax is 
favorable he added 
but the analyst said the fundamental problems of the united 
states economic slowdown and lower interest rates still were 
affecting the stock market 
steel issues were the only stocks to receive particular attention 
today he added

gobs of brown seaweed are piling up on 
some beaches quicker than they can be hauled away and officials 
dont know what is causing the seaweed assault 
for weeks tons of seaweed have washed up on beaches from the 
padre island national seashore below corpus christi to holly beach 
la and beyond on the gulf of mexico coast 
it began in earlytomid may and although it may have tapered 
off some in spots it hasnt quit yet 
its a losing battle said thomas garza a mustang island 
state park ranger you cant fight mother nature 
its keeping three dump trucks busy garza said theyve 
been doing the same thing the last three or four weeks nueces 
countys doing the same thing on their beaches 
in galveston high tides from tropical storm allison last week 
helped by pushing most of the seaweed from the surf line into 
parking areas at ra apffel and stewart beach parks storm tides 
also pushed the seaweed toward the back of the narrower western 
beaches but left most of the rotting material lying on the sand in 
front of the dune line 
still small new deposits have washed up and officials fear that 
seaweed carried back to sea will come ashore again 
the seaweed is really sargassum or brown algae that grows in a 
calm part of the midatlantic ocean 
there are many theories as to why the seaweed has come ashore in 
such large amounts with some blaming storms and other weather 
conditions 
if i had to guess id guess that theres a slightly unusual 
current pattern thats bringing more of the seaweed into the gulf 
and more of it into this part of the gulf said bill wardel a 
texas aampm universitygalveston marine botanist 
although the seaweed has plagued swimmers it helps prevent 
erosion by promoting growth of sand dunes said kenneth conway 
cameron county park system director

lord callaghan the former british prime minister 
and foreign secretary today remembered andrei a gromyko as a tough 
negotiator who softened toward the end of his tenure in the soviet 
leadership 
he was a good executor of a bad foreign policy that has now 
changed said callaghan who as james callaghan was foreign 
secretary in a labor government from 197476 and prime minister from 
197679 
callaghan said gromyko the longtime soviet diplomat foreign 
minister and president was a very hard man to negotiate with 
he represented soviet foreign policy at a time when it was 
expansionist and dogmatic he said toward the end of his 
period especially as president he softened and i was astonished 
when he described me as a good friend 
callaghan said that in private gromyko could relax and unbend 
he and his wife had a love of art and they particularly wanted to 
see the tate gallery when he came to london to study the works being 
displayed there 
gromyko died sunday at age 79

a group of 13 americans leaves for greenland this 
week to try to dig out a squadron of eight world war ii airplanes 
buried in polar ice since 1942 
the us planes two bombers and six fighters are buried 
beneath 260 feet of polar ice the atlantabased greeland expedition 
society wants to dig out all the planes and bring them to the united 
states maybe even repairing one of the fighters on site and flying 
it off the ice 
but expedition members will be happy simply to cut a piece of 
metal from one of the eight aircraft if we could get a control 
wheel out of a b17 it would be ideal said richard taylor an 
architect and pilot who will make the trip 
the eight aircraft are estimated to be worth a total of 5 
million if repaired 
the eight planes have been in greenland since july 15 1942 where 
their crews bellylanded them on the icecap when they ran out of 
fuel the planes had been headed for england but were forced to turn 
back because of bad weather 
on the way back the crews received incorrect weather 
information later there was speculation the information was sent by 
a german uboat 
all 25 crew member were rescued after nine days 
the eight airplanes were covered with snow and essentially 
forgotten until the early 1970s when their story got to pat epps 
an aviation pioneer and owner of epps aviation in atlanta 
several attempts to find the planes were made and last summer 
an expedition located the aircraft by subsurface radar and pushed a 
steam probe down to bump one of the aircraft 
on wednesday the expedition of 13 nine of them pilots leaves 
for the first threeweek trip to greenland they will carry 3 tons 
of food and equipment other supplies have been shipped to iceland 
and will be ferried in as needed 
among the adventurers was norman vaughan 84 of trapper creek 
alaska in 1942 the air force sent thenmaj vaughan a dog musher 
raised in alaska by dog sled to recover a secret bombsight left 
with one of the b17s 
the group will use a 475pound thermal borer to melt a onemeter 
wide hole straight down through the ice to one of the aircraft a 
b17 called big stoop 
once the craft is reached a 2inch disk of metal will be cut 
using a small coring device 
if everything else fails we will have at least one piece of 
tangible proof we have found the aircraft taylor said in a 
weekend interview 
then the group will use electric chain saws to cut a toward the 
plane in a bid to extract if from the ice

abe stolar is coming home to celebrate the fourth 
of july after 58 years in the soviet union a time that began with 
depressionera dreams of finding a workers paradise and ended with 
a fight to emigrate 
despite it all the 77yearold stolar is still a chicagoan when 
he talks the accent is pure west side 
stolar left the soviet union in march departing abruptly after 
fighting for 14 years to go to israel with his wife his son his 
daughterinlaw and two grandchildren 
he and his wife gita rozovskaya are arriving in chicago on 
tuesday the first stop in a 12city us tour that will take them 
from anchorage alaska to miami before it winds up in los angeles 
on aug 13 
his memory of chicago is just frozen in time in 1931 said 
david carle a spokesman for sen paul simon dill who helped 
draw attention to stolars efforts to leave the soviet union 
home chicago has changed 
the depression is over the skyline is taller humboldt park a 
workingclass neighborhood populated largely by eastern european 
jews when he left is largely hispanic 
but wrigley field looks much the same though the venerable 
ballpark now has lights stolar is to watch wednesday nights game 
there between the cubs and the san diego padres 
still baseball is not his passion said linda opper of 
chicago action for soviet jewry which is financing and arranging 
his visit his passion is opera the art institute the chicago 
theater 
stolar also has vivid memories of the grand 3000room stevens 
hotel now the conrad hilton and towers which has invited him to 
stay in its chicago suite on the 23rd floor the hotel was recently 
refurbished but its grand ballroom and grand salon dazzling with 
mirrors and gold leaf are virtually unchanged said assistant 
manager peter borup 
no special menu is planned since stolar is a junkfood 
junkie who likes hamburgers and hot dogs borup said 
while he gets reacquainted with chicago stolar plans to visit 
with old friends ms opper said and there is even talk of a high 
school reunion 
stolar was 19 when at the height of the depression his 
russianborn parents headed home to help build a new soviet society 
abe planned to stay only a short time ms opper said 
but russia was changing and history got in the way 
in 1937 stolars father disappeared in the stalinist purges his 
mother and a sister died in siberian camps he served in the red 
army and lost the sight in one eye to a german hand grenade 
after world war ii he worked as an announcer and translator for 
radio moscow married and had a son michael 
hes a very up person no matter whats happening hes also a 
wonderful complainer but thats talk ms opper said 
he is philosophically an optimist i think that has helped him 
stay healthy i think that has helped him stay young 
one day stolars son came home excited at winning a school 
contest 
he looked at his son so full of hope so full of enthusiasm 
and he thought this boy will never go anywhere in this country 
weve got to get out ms opper said 
he made his first move in 1975 but he and his family were held 
up over a slight problem with his wifes visa 
the problem concerning information she had access to at her job 
as a chemist took more than 10 years to resolve years that brought 
stolar a daughterinlaw julia and grandchildren sarah 3 and 
choni 1 
then julias mother refused to sign a financialrelease waiver 
she needed to leave the country 
finally in march the family was allowed to leave 
despite the changes that appear to be coming to the soviet union 
under mikhail gorbachev stolar believes a lot of the changes are 
cosmetic ms opper said 
many of abes friends have immigrated but there are thousands 
of people who still cannot leave

the founder of the new african american 
catholic congregation says he will adhere to catholic teachings on 
issues such as abortion and priestly celibacy while incorporating 
african and southern black religious traditions 
the rev george a stallings celebrated the imani temples first 
service on sunday before about 2000 people at howard university law 
school 
stallings said he created the church because he believes the 
establishment catholic church had failed to meet the spiritual and 
cultural needs of blacks imani means faith in swahili 
but cardinal james a hickey of washington has condemned 
stallings plans for the new church which were announced two weeks 
ago and forbade stallings to celebrate mass 
in spite of his claims to the contrary father stallings 
action is a serious step toward separating himself from the roman 
catholic church hickey said recently in a statement 
stallings has said that he has been fired by hickey as evangelist 
for the archdiocese 
sundays service began with an entrance procession that included 
one participant wearing dreadlocks and others who shook bells 
and used rattles traditionally used in african ceremonies 
the ceremony included catholic prayers and liturgy along with 
words borrowed from african and southern black revival traditions 
black representatives of other faiths including baptists and 
muslims attended to show support for stallings move 
at one point stallings chanted we cant wait how much longer 
does the roman catholic church need 
stallings in an interview broadcast on wrc television on sunday 
said he plans to abide by catholic teachings on issues such as 
abortion birth control and celibacy for priests 
but stallings said just because we will follow the church 
teaching does not mean we wont challenge laws are not good when 
they bind and constrict men and women 
he said his imani temple church will allow women to serve in 
various church ceremonies although they will not be ordained as 
priests 
but stallings said the roman catholic church will inevitably lose 
black members if strict bans on abortion and premarital sex are not 
loosened some blacks also believe celibacy for priests should be 
optional he said 
stallings a convert to catholicism attracted national attention 
as pastor of st teresa of avila parish in southeast washington when 
he began to incorporate into the traditional mass the gospel music 
and preaching and worship styles familiar to many blacks 
in 12 years at st teresas membership increased from 200 to 
2000 stallings said there are about 80000 black catholics in the 
washington archdiocese 
stallings said he has not been formally excommunicated by hickey 
the church cant throw me out and even if they do throw me out i 
have my own opinion they have theirs he said 
excommunication is a term used by the powerful to threaten the 
powerless stallings said

said bomb experts later found another explosive nearby and defused 
it authorities said 
an statement from the ira which is outlawed in ireland and

ireland to a freelance journalist in northern ireland the caller 
used a codeword to authenticate the claim 
it was the second attack on british military in west germany in 
two weeks

british public are restricted by their government from learning of 
its failure in ireland and the resistance to its rule the ira 
statement said 
the car was parked along a quiet residential street where many 
british military families live on the outskirts of this northern 
city 
the ministry of defense in london identified the soldier as cpl 
steve smith of the royal tank regiment a native of yorkshire county 
in northern england

moenchengladbach said today the soldiers wife and four children 
were still being treated at area hospitals police said smiths 
wife 30yearold tina and the couples children ages 2 through 
11 were in satisfactory condition 
bomb disposal experts called to the scene found another explosive 
device hidden under a car and defused it and residents of nearby 
apartments were evacuated while police searched the area for other 
bombs officials said 
hanover police said today that they were looking for two suspects 
in their 30s whom witnesses saw nearby shortly before the attack 
police have composite sketches of the pair officials said 
on june 19 a bomb exploded in the living quarters at a british 
military barracks near osnabrueck no one was injured in the blast 
police suspect the ira in that attack 
on june 14 west german prosecutors indicted two suspected ira 
members on attempted murder charges in connection with 1987 and 1988 
bombing attacks aimed at the british military that wounded 46 
people most of them west germans 
the ira has attacked british troops on the continent in its 
campaign to force the british out of northern ireland and unite the 
predominantly protestant province with mostly roman catholic ireland

andrei a gromykos unsmiling countenance and 
staunch party line positions personified the soviet union for 
nearly three decades 
the 79yearold former foreign minister whose death was 
announced today lived only nine months after being retired from the 
largely ceremonial presidency to make way for mikhail s gorbachev 
the communist party chief who wanted to turn the job into a powerful 
post 
but the man known to western diplomats as old stoneface 
mr nyet and grim grom paved the way for soviet leaders to 
make a graceful exit until gromyko left the ruling politburo with 
official praise on sept 30 and was retired the next day from the 
presidency most senior soviet officials either died in office or 
fell from power into obscurity 
gromykos stature was confirmed today when gorbachev announced 
his death to the legislature the supreme soviet and deputies stood 
in unison for a moment of silence 
gromyko died 16 days shy of his 80th birthday 
one of the bestremembered pictures of him was one of the last 
he sat amid members of the ruling communist party politburo the 
only person not casting an affirmative vote for his removal from the 
presidency he abstained 
gromyko appeared again in public in january to attend a 
conference of americans soviets and cubans who were involved in the 
1962 cuban missile crisis 
two days before the crisis erupted gromyko calmly told president 
john f kennedy the soviets had no missiles in cuba at the 
conference in january other soviet officials disclosed that 
onethird of the kremlins nuclear arsenal was deployed in cuba at 
the time with another third aboard ships bound for the island 90 
miles off florida 
although he served nearly four years as president providing a 
visible symbol of continuity as gorbachev overhauled the soviet 
leadership and bureaucracy gromyko was best known outside the 
soviet union as his governments career foreign policy chief 
born july 18 1909 into a byelorussian peasant family andrei 
andreyevich gromyko joined the communist party as a young man and 
rose quickly through government ranks 
he served every leader from josef stalin to gorbachev he dealt 
with hundreds of foreign officials whose faces changed with the 
world order after world war ii and he was regarded as a skillful 
spokesman for his countrys interests 
gromyko was respected by those who faced him across the 
bargaining table for his ability to enunciate his governments 
policy and for his voluminous knowledge of historical detail but 
his stubborn refusal to bend on key issues frustrated adversaries 
who sometimes blamed him for blocking arms control by walking away 
from the table 
after joining the foreign ministry and being posted to washington 
after the outbreak of world war ii gromyko rose quickly to the rank 
of ambassador to the united states and was named his countrys first 
permanent representative to the united nations in 1946 
during the world bodys formative years he earned the nickname 
mr nyet for the 26 vetoes he cast in the security council 
nikita khrushchev who elevated gromyko to foreign minister told 
the united nations the man was so loyal he would drop his pants and 
sit on a block of ice if ordered him to do so gromyko sat 
impassively as khrushchev spoke as he did again several years later 
when khrushchev startled the un general assembly by pounding a 
shoe on his desk there have been reports the infamous shoe was not 
khrushchevs but gromykos 
gromyko was a player in every superpower confrontation for more 
than a quartercentury but rarely shared his private side his 
memoirs published after he left the foreign ministry were most 
notable for their lack of spicy detail 
although he was generally regarded as a communist party 
hardliner gromyko nominated the relatively youthful reformer 
gorbachev to take over the soviet leadership in march 1985 
and although gorbachev then removed gromyko from the foreign 
ministers post he had held 26 years gromyko continued to serve in 
a visible role as chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet 
which made him head of state the equivalent of president 
gromykos advancing age and gorbachevs announcement in june 1988 
that he planned to create a strong presidency as part of an overhaul 
of the soviet political structure made gromykos replacement 
inevitable 
he said he was sad to leave 
age is a stubborn thing the veteran communist said in a 
televised statement on the night his retirement was announced

the us embassy filed a protest today over what 
it called a premeditated army attack on apartments of american 
diplomats and other foreigners last month 
the protest is likely to further worsen relations already made 
tense by us criticism of chinas crackdown on unarmed 
prodemocracy protesters 
also today two taiwanese reporters said a colleague was taken 
away by security forces after he reportedly met with fugitive 
student leader wang dan the reporters said they feared wang also 
was arrested 
the evening television news reported five people have been 
arrested including three students allegedly for stealing a 
submachine gun from an army vehicle during the first days of the 
crackdown four other people turned themselves in for stealing army 
guns and were released the report said 
us embassy spokesman sheridan bell said charge daffaires 
raymond burghardt delivered the protest note to the foreign 
ministry which did not respond immediately 
chinese soldiers fired into jianguomenwai apartment compound on 
june 6 a day after the state department said the us embassy had 
given refuge to two chinese dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li 
shuxian 
a us embassy report charged the shooting was premeditated but 
did not link it to chinas anger over us protection of fang and li 
the united states filed one protest shortly after the shooting 
the new protest challenges for the first time the chinese account 
that soldiers were responding to sniper fire from within the 
apartment compound 
at the time radio beijing said one soldier was killed and three 
were injured and plainclothes officers who went into the compound 
brought out a chinese man they claimed was the sniper 
no witnesses reported seeing chinese soldiers hit however 
the us report said the arrest appeared to have been staged it 
also said the soldiers fired not only from the ground but from a 
building across the street where they had taken up positions the 
day before 
a diplomat from another western country speaking on condition of 
anonymity confirmed that some bullets were fired from the opposite 
building and whizzed over the heads of children playing in the 
foreigners apartments no one was hurt but most foreigners 
evacuated the compound later that day 
there is no doubt in this embassys opinion that certain 
apartments were deliberately targeted the us report said 
it said one us defense attaches apartment was hit by 18 
bullets ten other us diplomats apartments also were hit as were 
apartments of other nationals such as spaniards 
shortly after the shooting the european economic community asked 
the chinese government for an explanation but received no response 
china has agreed to pay for damage caused by the shooting 
the bush administration in other responses to the chinese 
crackdown has criticized it and cut off military aid 
wang a history student at beijing university was a leader of 
seven weeks of studentled protests in beijing for a freer society 
he went underground after the army crushed the protests on june 34 
killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
wangs name appeared on a list of 21 students wanted by police 
antonio jiang a reporter for taiwans journalist weekly said 
security officials searched taiwan independence morning post 
reporter huang tehpeis hotel room at 3 am today 
police grabbed him as he left his hotel just before noon and 
pushed him into an unmarked car 
huang reported that he met with wang on sunday and was driving in 
the posts car when they realized they were being followed 
according to jiang huang got out and the driver left with wang 
the driver has not returned jiang said 
beijing police and the city government foreign affairs office 
said they did not know if wang was arrested jiang said police 
denied any knowledge about huang 
taiwan government spokesman shaw yuming urged beijing to expel 
huang as it has western reporters who interviewed prodemocracy 
students 
chinese guards stationed outside the us and australian 
embassies who normally carry only revolvers were armed today with 
longbarreled automatic pistols and wore military helmets for a 
third straight day extra uniformed and plainclothers guards also 
were posted 
the guards refused to explain their new gear which may be linked 
to the presence of fang and li at the us embassy and unconfirmed 
reports the australians also were sheltering fugitives 
in other developments chinas official newspapers gave over most 
of their front pages today to pictures and biographies of 10 young 
officers and soldiers killed during the june 34 attack 
senior leader deng xiaoping gave them the title guardian of the 
peoples republic of china which western diplomats said they 
believed was a newly created honor 
the government said the 10 were beaten or burned to death by 
protesters

iranians today gathered at bandar abbas 
airport to remember 290 people killed one year ago when the us 
navy shot down a civilian jet moments after it left the city tehran 
radio reported 
the director of civil aviation announced that the airport where 
the illfated flight originated had been renamed the international 
airport of the tir 12 martyrs after the date of the incident 
according to the lunar persian calendar tir 12 last year 
coincided with july 3 1988 the day the uss vincennes mistook iran 
air flight 655 for an iranian fighter plane coming in for an attack 
and shot it down 
newspaper editorials today called the incident a crime or an 
act of terrorism 
the jetliner was on a commercial flight from bandar abbas where 
a large air base is located to dubai in the united arab emirates 
the majority of passengers aboard the a300 airbus were iranians 
all 290 people aboard died 
relatives of the victims clergymen and air force and civil 
aviation officials attended the airport ceremony tehran radio said 
it did not provide a crowd estimate 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said the civil aviation 
director mohammad nabi habibi unveiled a painting depicting the 
incident and displayed what he said were several parts of the 
aircraft pulled from the persian gulf 
the martyrs of this incident were another group of innocent 
people who fell victims to american atrocities he said 
the daily abrar in an editorial carried by irna and monitored in 
nicosia said the iranian nation will never forget us crimes 
this has kindled a fire in the heart of the iranian nation 
which would not be extinguished without the elimination of us 
criminals it said 
the englishlanguage kayhan international said the iran air 
tragedy proved that tehrans relations with washington are 
irreparable 
those who feel the situation may change in the near future are 
advised to go through the pictures of mutilated bodies of iranians 
on board the airbus it said in an editorial 
more than 200 relatives of the iran air tragedy are suing 
designers and manufacturers of the ships radar system a spokesman 
for the group said sunday in abu dhabi 
nagib ghafoor spokesman for the flight 655 litigation group 
said the suit was filed june 28 in us district court in san 
francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the victims 
pentagon analysts have said that splitsecond decisions aboard 
the vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to 
immediately match the planes radar trace with digital direction 
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen 
ghafoor said the suit was filed against the general electric co 
and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar 
equipment on board the uss vincennes 
ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment 
indicated the aircraft approaching the vincennes was an f14 diving 
in an attack mode rather than the iran air flight which was 
climbing 
he said claims against the united states on behalf of the 
families are in the process of being filed as well 
ge is based in fairfield conn it refused comment sunday saying 
it had not seen the suit 
the iranian government has been seeking a world court verdict 
against the united states and demanded financial compensation for 
the dead washington has indicated it is willing to pay compensation 
to victims families but wants to be sure no money goes to the 
iranian government

merchants are of two minds when asked 
how they feel about having president bush as a summer neighbor 
his presence allows them to hawk dozens of bush knickknacks 
ranging from photo opportunities with a lifesized bush likeness to 
bush whiskey jiggers to bush christmas tree balls to bumperstickers 
and tshirts rechristening this tiny seaside town kennebushport 
but some merchants worry the bush presence will keep tourists 
away they blame news stories chronicling the circus atmosphere 
surrounding the president the secret service and the white house 
press corps 
it may be possible that some people have been scared away by 
stories in the press but we dont know that yet said susan m 
savell executive director of the kennebunkkennebunkport chamber of 
commerce 
ms savell said merchants wont be able to fully judge the impact 
of the bush factor until after the independence day weekend which 
the bushes were spending at their home on walkers point 
the town has vacancies she said but businesses were hoping 
things will pick up as the season wears on 
bush has been visiting kennebunkport since boyhood but the new 
security demands since he became president have prompted complaints 
from local authorities last week democratic rep joseph brennan 
introduced legislation seeking 160000 a year for kennebunk and 
kennebunkport police 
brennan said that local law enforcement officials are proud to 
help provide security but that the responsibility has placed a 
heavy financial burden on these departments which are already 
hardpressed for funds 
on saturday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
president wants to help and feels very strongly for 
kennebunkport but cannot spend federal funds on local government 
without an act of congress 
at the tourist shop whats in store proprietor jack bigioni is 
offering for sale all things bush 
i expected it to be a bangup spring bigioni said 
unfortunately a lot of the papers are writing that its a mob 
scene and theres lots of traffic and no parking and im afraid 
its had an adverse effect 
still bigioni sells quite a bit of bush memorabilia including 
photographs of people posing by a likeness of the president and 
house shoes that feature pinkish plastic caricatures of the 
president and the first lady peering out from under red white and 
blue bedsheets theres even a george bush mask billed as a 
kinder gentler coverup 
the bush slippers have sold out twice but the picture 
opportunities are the best seller even though an ordinance prevents 
bigioni from putting the bush likeness on the sidewalk 
bigioni hopes to get bush himself to come pose 
itd be a great picture bigioni said hopefully by the end 
of the summer hell do it 
at the kennebunk book port books on bush are popular before he 
became president bush autographed 500 copies of his autobiography 
looking forward written with victor gold the books sold out 
employee julia collins said bush post cards also are a big seller 
we probably sell more pictures of his house than pictures of 
him she said everyone knows what he looks like 
one tourist who definitely will keep coming is bush the 
president plans to spend about two weeks of august and early 
september at walkers point 
bush may not be buying much of the kitsch that bears his name 
but he did autograph a pair of the george and barbara slippers for 
mabel hanson who has been serving fresh seafood and homemade 
desserts for 20 years at mabels lobster claw the bushes who are 
regular customers exploded into laughter when they saw the 
slippers ms hanson said 
they just broke up she said you could hear them laughing 
downtown she said george my nose doesnt look like that he 
said it does too

a witness today testified he saw the man 
charged with killing prime minister olaf palme at a train station 
around the time palme was shot outside a movie theater 
algot asell 68 was the first witness in the trial to support 
the alibi of the defendant christer pettersson pettersson denies 
killing palme 
the prosecution said it would call witnesses to cast doubt on 
asells credibility 
asell said he saw pettersson waiting for a train at the marsta 
station between 11 pm and 1130 pm on feb 28 1986 palme a 
fourterm prime minister was fatally shot at 1121 that night while 
walking home with his wife from a movie 
the train station is about 18 miles from the crime scene and more 
than 30 minutes by train 
other witnesses have testified they saw pettersson waiting for 
palme outside the movie theater and following him down the street 
mrs palme identified pettersson as the man she saw a few feet away 
just after her husband was shot 
asell said he did not notice the exact time when he saw 
pettersson but he said he bought a chocolate bar near the train 
station just before the store closed at 930 pm then went into a 
nearby restaurant until one of the last trains left the station at 
11 pm or 1130 pm 
asell said he remembered the night because it was the first time 
in many years he had been in marsta 
assell knew pettersson from the time they lived in the same 
neighborhood and he once helped a security guard break up a fight 
in which pettersson was involved 
also today a man who shared an apartment with pettersson for 
seven months ulf akansson said pettersson was an admirer of palme 
and that palme never carried a gun

mayor teddy kollek says the 140000 arabs in 
jerusalem should participate in any elections held to choose 
palestinians to negotiate the future of the west bank and gaza strip 
we must accept that the arabs of east jerusalem see themselves 
as palestinians kollek was quoted as saying over the weekend by 
his spokeswoman bonnie boxer 
a showdown over the election issue is expected wednesday in the 
rightwing likud bloc party rebels have said they will force prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to amend his election plan to exclude arabs 
in east jerusalem from voting 
under shamirs plan the vote would be followed by negotiations 
between the palestinians elected and israeli officials on the future 
of the occupied territories however the plan rules out creation of 
an independent palestinian state 
i think the anger and hostility we would provoke by denying 
jerusalem arabs the opportunity to participate in the proposed 
elections is far more ominous than any supposed danger from their 
joining a democratic process kollek 78 a member of the 
leftleaning labor party was quoted as saying 
but rightwingers say israel would weaken its claim to 
sovereignty over all of the city by allowing participation of 
residents of the eastern sector of jerusalem which was captured 
from jordan in the 1967 war 
most residents of east jerusalem have jordanian citizenship but 
are permanent residents of israel and carry israeli identity cards 
they are allowed to vote in city elections but not national 
balloting in israel 
what the israeli government is proposing now is elections to 
choose palestinian arab leaders to negotiate with israel on the 
shaping of the palestinian future said kollek 
the arabs of jerusalem clearly deserve the opportunity to share 
in the decisonmaking process this is no way prejudices israel 
sovereignty in united jerusalem he said

the supreme court ruled today that some 
governmentsponsored religious displays are permissible as long as 
they do not have the effect of promoting or endorsing religious 
beliefs 
by a 54 vote the court said displaying a christmas nativity 
scene inside the allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh violates 
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it 
appears to endorse christian principles 
but the court unanimously permitted a hanukkah menorah on the 
front steps of the citycounty building in pittsburgh because that 
display also included a christmas tree and a sing saluting liberty 
the ruling came on the final day of this court session along with 
a longawaiting ruling on the controversial abortion issue in the 
abortion case the justices gave states far greater power to limit 
abortions but stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision 
legalizing abortion 
the court said the menorah a ninecandle candelabra used during 
the celebration of the jewish holiday hanukkah does not appear to 
endorse judaism because of its particular physical setting 
the menorah display includes a christmas tree and a sign saluting 
liberty the court said the inclusion of the tree and sign give the 
overall display a secular purpose the court said

the menorah display includes a christmas tree and a sign saluting

overall display a secular purpose the court said 
while the justices were split sharply in declaring the nativity 
scene unconstitutional the court substantially upheld its longused 
test for determining when the wall between church and state is 
breached 
justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in

the supreme court ruled today that some 
governmentsponsored religious displays are permissible as long as 
they do not have the effect of promoting or endorsing religious 
beliefs 
by a 54 vote the court said displaying a christmas nativity 
scene inside the allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh violates 
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it 
appears to endorse christian principles 
but the court unanimously permitted a hanukkah menorah on the 
front steps of the citycounty building in pittsburgh because that 
display also included a christmas tree and a sing saluting liberty 
the ruling came on the final day of this court session along with 
a longawaiting ruling on the controversial abortion issue in the 
abortion case the justices gave states far greater power to limit 
abortions but stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision 
legalizing abortion 
the court said the menorah a ninecandle candelabra used during 
the celebration of the jewish holiday hanukkah does not appear to 
endorse judaism because of its particular physical setting 
the menorah display includes a christmas tree and a sign saluting 
liberty the court said the inclusion of the tree and sign give the 
overall display a secular purpose the court said 
while the justices were split sharply in declaring the nativity 
scene unconstitutional the court substantially upheld its longused 
test for determining when the wall between church and state is 
breached

creche showed an unjustified hostility toward religion a 
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents 
todays ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the 
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in pawtucket ri 
the creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such 
as santa claus reindeer and snowmen 
the pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself 
justice department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the 
pittsburgh displays contending since the use of the creche as a 
symbol of the holiday does not constitute a government endorsement 
of the religious content of that symbol the government is not 
required to surround it with candy canes reindeer or other purely 
secular symbols

the supreme court decision today giving states 
expanded authority to restrict abortions is a blueprint for 
controversy in the 50 state legislatures and in hundreds of 
political races for years to come 
even before the ruling was handed down antiabortion crusaders 
said they were ready to pressure state legislatures to tighten 
restrictions on abortion 
the courts decision gave them plenty to work with so much so 
that moments after the justices had ruled one key prochoice 
advocate molly yard of the national organization for women said 
it chips away this is war against women 
in its ruling the court stopped short of overturning a 
16yearold case that established a womans right to an abortion 
but in a ruling in a missouri case it said states can take a number 
of steps to restrict abortions particularly in cases where they are 
not needed to save life 
more than a dozen states have laws on the books to restrict and 
even outlaw abortions designed to take effect if the court 
overturned the 1973 ruling 
however enforceable they are they provide an early look at the 
direction that some legislatures are likely to take following the 
courts ruling and demonstrate the difficulty of the job 
confronting now and other prochoice groups 
sarah weddington a texas lawyer who successfully argued the 1973 
case predicted a tremendous surge of legislative activity and 
said the new ruling could lead to abortion being almost if not 
actually illegal in at least some states and maybe many of the 
states 
the court also said it would review two more abortion cases next 
term meaning that the political struggle about to ensue will take 
place on terms that could shift again before the year is out 
unde this cloud of uncertainty abortionrights groups are vowing 
to make their issue a litmus test for candidates for state 
legislatures 
their premise if you cant trust the high court to protect your 
right to abortion at least you can vote for state and local 
officials who will 
we intend to make this a decisive issue for the publics voting 
decisions in 1989 and 1990 says kate michelman executive 
director of the national abortion rights action league the 
prochoice sleeping giant is awakening 
but the prochoice leaders will face antiabortion advocates 
whose hand has been strengthened by the court 
ive always said that if the court overturns the 1973 ruling 
on tuesday wed introduce legislation on wednesday to outlaw 
abortions says pennsylvania lawmaker stephen freind 
public opinion polls on abortion have found virtually no shift in 
attitudes over the years more than threequarters of americans have 
said since 1975 that abortion should be legal under all or certain 
circumstances for the past decade some 60 percent have said they 
approve of legal abortion if a woman and her doctor agree to it 
but intense debate has continued in state legislatures resulting 
in a welter of varying statutes and a sizable contingent of 
lawmakers who looked with dread at the idea of refueling the 
abortion debate at the state level 
naral estimates more than 250 abortionrelated bills have been 
introduced in state legislatures since 1988 state lawmakers of both 
parties have used terms like nightmare and gridlock to 
describe the prospect of even greater state control over abortions 
nearly three dozen states have laws requiring parental consent 
for abortions for minor women parental notification or both and 
all but a dozen have cut off medicaid financing of abortions for 
poor women 
but as one state legislator put it the states were not playing 
with real bullets the court decision expanding state authority 
is expected to make the controversy over restrictions like parental 
consent pale beside the battles to come

on the steamy marble plaza facing the supreme 
court today there were cries of triumph groans of anguish 
but for once those favoring abortion and those fervently against 
it appeared to agree 
the supreme court had just given the prolife movement a major 
boost 
i think its a serious setback for us said former 
congresswoman bella abzug a proabortion advocate 
this is a creeping invasion a creeping invasion of womens 
rights thats what it is she said 
it was a major victory for the prolife movement said tom 
glessner executive director of the christian action council 
the moment of decision shortly after 10 am brought a 
momentary silence to the plaza a momentary quieting of the 
competitive chanting 
men and women in dark suits feverishly turned the pages of the 
courts decision in william webster attorney general of missouri 
et al vs reproductive health services et al 
im not clear what happened exactly said a young woman in 
purple shorts 
im trying to figure this out said a young man i want to 
read it in the paper tomorrow 
but then the approximate meaning of the decision giving states 
more power to limit abortion rights but stopping short of 
overturning the landmark roe vs wade proabortion decision began 
to take hold 
the chanting began again 
not the courts not the states women will decide our fate 
shouted the group of 50 or so proabortion demonstrators on the 
broad sidewalk facing the courts romantemple facade 
ah too bad a teenager gloated you guys lost 
what does this mean someone asked molly yard president of 
the national organization for women 
it means if youve got money you can get an abortion she 
said if youre poor too bad youre down the drain 
what do you do now 
there are lots of things we can do she said as she marched 
through a forest of microphones and television cameras were 
going to mobilize all over the country 
the pro and antiabortion demonstrators they numbered about 
200 tried unsuccessfully to drown each other out 
hey hey ho ho roe vs wade has got to go 
one two three four abortion rights for rich and poor five 
six seven eight separation church and state 
a bearded man wearing the brown robe of a catholic friar knelt 
on the sidewalk fingering the beads of a long rosary a sign held 
above his head read the baby had no choice 
to his left a competing sign keep abortion legal 
across the plaza organizers of both groups prolife and 
prochoice talked about next time 
more abortion cases will be argued before the court this fall and 
both sides said they saw opportunity and hope in that

washington secular symbols 
lower courts across the nation have been confused about just 
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental 
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional 
promotion or advancement of religion 
most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one 
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious 
blackmun acknowledged today that the 1984 ruling is none too 
clear but he said todays ruling may help dispel the confusion 
he said these are the guiding principles the governments use 
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of 
endorsing religious beliefs and the effect of the governments use 
of religious symoblism depends upon its context 
in pittsburgh from 1981 to 1987 a 9footwide creche depicting 
the birth of jesus christ was displayed inside the county courthouse 
in the city for about six weeks during the christmas season 
a block away an 18foot menorah was displayed each year from 
1982 to 1987 on the front steps of the building that houses city and 
county offices it stood next to a 45foot christmas tree 
a federal judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays 
in late 1987 but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled by a 
21 vote that they were unlawful that ruling prevented the 
displays being shown last christmas season 
the creche is owned by the holy name society a roman catholic 
mens group that arranges for its display the menorah is owned by 
chabad a small jewish sect that loaned the symbol to the city free 
of charge 
the legal controversy began when the american civil liberties 
union asked for removal of the creche and menorah in 1986 the 
request was denied 
the aclu several lawyers who conduct business at the courthouse 
a unitarian minister and a moslem then sued seeking to block the 
displays

the supreme court today ordered reargument in 
its next term of an important battle over state taxing powers 
the justices will hear arguments over related cases from arkansas 
and florida when they return to the bench in october for their 
198990 term 
rulings in the two cases are likely sometime next year 
at issue is whether a business that successfully challenges a 
state tax as an undue burden on interstate commerce is entitled to 
be refunded money it paid before the tax was invalidated 
the court announced today that it will broaden its inquiry next 
term the court said it also will consider whether a state rather 
than refund tax revenues to those hurt by discriminatory levies 
may retroactively raise taxes of those who benefited from the 
discrimination 
in the arkansas case trucking companies are seeking 160 million 
in tax refunds after the state supreme court declared the states 
mileagebased tax on trucks unconstitutional 
the state court based its ruling on a 1987 ruling by the nations 
highest court that struck down a similar tax in pennsylvania 
the arkansas court ordered state officials to pay 49 million in 
refunds from a special escrow account created in the summer of 1987 
but the state court said the trucking companies are not entitled to 
additional refunds on taxes the state collected before the escrow 
account was created 
in the florida case a state tax that granted an exemption to 
instate liquor dealers was struck down outofstate dealers then 
sought refunds on the money they had paid under the tax

the attorney who successfully argued the roe vs 
wade case said she was disappointed by the supreme courts ruling 
today that gives states greater power to limit abortions 
the new ruling could eventually lead to abortion being almost 
if not actually illegal in at least some states and maybe many of 
the states said sarah weddington reached by telephone shortly 
after the courts decision was announced 
ive invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been 
handed a major defeat she said 
ms weddington represented norma mccorvey a dallas woman who 
took the pseudonym jane roe in the landmark 1973 abortion case 
establishing womens constitutional right to abortions 
the court today in a series of mostly 54 votes restored 
several missouri abortion regulations that a lower court had 
invalidated for unduly interfering with womens constitutional right 
to abortion 
she predicted the decision will not immediately affect women 
seeking abortions until state legislatures pass new laws 
but the austin texas attorney said the decision signals a 
major change in direction for the court 
roe vs wade basically said that there is a right of privacy in 
the constitution that allows women to make certain choices for 
themselves and one of those was the choice of whether to continue or 
terminate a pregnancy she said 
while the supreme court did not say there is no right of 
privacy they didnt say we think there is or we think there 
isnt what they said was were going to allow the states to 
regulate in major ways

the supreme court today agreed to review a 1984 
federal law requiring that student religious groups be given the 
same access as other extracurricular clubs to public high school 
facilities 
the justices setting the stage for an important ruling on 
churchstate relations said they will decide whether a student 
bible study group must be allowed to meet at an omaha neb high 
school after class hours 
the court will hear an appeal by school officials who say giving 
such access to the club violates the constitutionally required 
separation of church and state 
a decision is expected sometime in 1990 
students at westside high school sought in 1985 to organize a 
christian bible study club officials refused to approve the club 
suggesting the students meet instead at a church next door 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the school officials but the 
8th us circuit court of appeals overturned the decision in 
february saying the club must be allowed to meet on school premises 
the appeals court noted that the high school has let some 30 
other extracurricular groups such as a chess club and a scuba 
diving club meet on school grounds after class hours under a 
faculty members supervision 
congress in 1984 passed the equal access act barring public high 
schools that accept federal aid from discriminating against groups 
based on the religious political philosophical or other content 
of the speech at such meetings 
the law is designed to force schools to give the same privileges 
to religious clubs as other noncurriculumrelated student 
groups 
the supreme court ruled in 1981 that staterun universities 
cannot ban student groups from using campus facilities for religious 
worship and study 
but the justices have not decided whether the same rule should 
apply to high schools 
they examined the issue in 1986 in a pennsylvania case but 
because of a procedural flaw did not answer the question 
at that time four court members said they would let high school 
students conduct such meetings two of those former chief justice 
warren e burger and justice lewis f powell no longer sit on the 
court the two others were nowchief justice william h rehnquist 
and justice byron r white 
justice department lawyers in the former reagan administration 
which also protested the courts ban on organized prayer in public 
schools had pressed for permitting student bible study and worship 
meetings 
the bush administration has not stated its position on the 
nebraska case acted on today 
the 8th circuit court rejected the contention that high school 
students are more impressionable than college students and therefore 
should be given more protection from student religious groups that 
may appear to be sanctioned by school authorities 
we reject this notion because congress considered the 
difference in the maturity level of secondary students and 
university students before passing the equal access act the 
appeals court said we accept congress factfinding 
besides nebraska the 8th circuit court ruling set a binding 
precedent in arkansas iowa minnesota missouri north and south 
dakota 
the case is westside community schools vs mergens 881597

justice harry a blackmun author of the 1973 
supreme court decision legalizing abortion said in a strongly 
worded dissent today that signs are evident and very ominous 
that the court will move to reverse a womans right to abortion 
blackmun said that with its decision today the court was 
inviting further challenges to its landmark roe vs wade decision 
he criticized the court majority for not acknowledging this 
the silence is callous it is also profoundly disruptive of 
this court as an institution he said from the bench 
he said that with its decision the court was inviting charges 
of cowardice and illegitimacy 
blackmun said that overturning the roe vs wade decision would 
cast in darkness the hope of every woman in this country 
for today at least the law of abortion stands undisturbed 
blackmun said for today the women of this nation will retain the 
liberty to control their destinies but the signs are evident and 
very ominous and a chill wind blows 
he predicted that reversal of roe vs wade would force hundreds 
of thousands of women each year to defy the law and place their 
health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands of 
backalley abortionists or they would attempt to perform abortions 
upon themselves with disastrous results 
every year many women especially poor and minority women 
would die or suffer debilitating trauma all in the name of enforced 
morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion as it may be 
as blackmun read his remarks justice thurgood marshall watched 
intently but the five other justices did not look at him justices 
sandra day oconnor and anthony kennedy were not on the bench 
although his words were strong blackmun at no time raised his 
voice or showed any signs of overflowing passion

legislators approved a new law allowing 
opposition political parties a move that will end the oneparty 
rule existing in this north african state since its independence in 
1962 
todays newspapers reported 40 groups intend to form parties to 
challenge the political dominance of president chadli bendjedids 
national liberation front which has ruled algeria since the country 
won independence from france 
the vote came sunday after deputies considered 34 amendments to 
the bill it is the latest progression since widespread rioting in 
october left 170 people dead and led to calls for reform 
in a series of referendums since november algerias 13 million 
voters have backed sweeping political changes proposed by bendjedid 
who was elected to a third fiveyear term in december 
the first multicandidate balloting will be in municipal elections 
in december 
according to the bill groups wanting to form political parties 
now can apply to the interior ministry which has two months to give 
a reply 
the state will contribute to each political party in proportion 
to its membership in parliament parties are not allowed to accept 
financial or material support 
the new law forbids members of the military policemen 
magistrates or members of the constitutional council from belonging 
to political movements 
it also does not allow the formation of parties based on 
regional linguistic racial or religious grounds some deputies 
felt that article was aimed at algerias berber minority or islamic 
fundamentalists in this country one of the more liberal arab states 
as ruling party deputies debated the bill several hundred 
people many of them women demonstrated peacefully in front of 
parliament building calling for respect for womens rights and 
equality before the law 
in february algerians approved a new constitution which made no 
mention of the socialist policy underpinning the previous 1976 
constitution drawn up by president houari boumedienne who ruled 
algeria from 196578 
this month parliament also is to consider reforms on laws 
governing freedom of expression and the electoral code

lawmakers in several states today predicted fierce legislative 
battles as antiabortion activists seek laws based on the us 
supreme courts ruling legalizing new restrictions on abortion 
in alabama republican state rep greg beers promised prompt 
legislation to impose limits on abortion in coming months he said 
i believe youll see every state in america introducing 
legislation like this 
pennsylvanias leading abortion foe rep stephen freind said 
that while the 1973 roe v wade decision legalizing abortion was 
still partially in place theyve tremendously chipped away at it 
we can go a hell of a lot further in restricting abortions as 
long as there is a rational basis for doing so freind said 
it does throw it back in our laps said rep richard m 
dillinger an indiana republican but he said the outcome was 
unclear i dont know about the sentiment of this legislature 
nothings been done on abortion recently 
florida house speaker tom gustafson said before the ruling that 
he would call for a special session of the legislature if the court 
authorized new restrictions on abortion otherwise he said the 
issue would overshadow other work of the regular session 
the battle is now going to go to the state legislature 
declared eric johnke of planned parenthood of pennsylvania a 
supporter of legal abortion we are committed to fighting it out 
there 
in iowa gov terry branstad who said he has a consistent 
prolife position hailed the ruling but took a middle position on 
possible new laws he said he first will consult with a wide range 
of people adding i think we have to consider all points of 
view 
similarly sen lu hardin an arkansas democrat who has 
introducted antiabortion legislation in the past said he would 
study the ruling before acting on new laws for his state am i 
just going to automatically sponsor them the answer is no he 
said 
the high court upheld several abortion restrictions in a missouri 
law including provisions banning any public employee from 
performing or assisting in abortions not neccessary to save the 
mothers life and banning the use of any public hospital or other 
facility in such abortions 
the ruling also said the states may ban the use of tax money for 
encouraging or counseling women to have abortions not necessary 
to save their lives and may require doctors to determine when 
possible whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old can live outside the 
womb 
as a result of the ruling what we are going to see is a 
tremendous surge of legislative activity said sarah weddington 
the texas lawyer who argued the case known as roe v wade that 
legalized abortion in 1973 
new state laws she said could eventually lead to abortion 
being almost if not actually illegal in at least some states and 
maybe many of the states 
while roe v wade was not reversed we are considering it a 
victory said molly kelly of the prolife coalition of southeast 
pennsylvania 
were obviously going to try to get our legislature not only to 
uphold the missouri provisions but also to challenge roe so that 
the next time this case comes up we think roe will go down she 
said

the supreme court ruled today that some 
governmentsponsored religious displays are permissible as long as 
they do not have the effect of promoting or endorsing religious 
beliefs 
by a 54 vote the court said displaying a christmas nativity 
scene inside the allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh violates 
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it 
appears to endorse christian principles 
but the court unanimously permitted a hanukkah menorah on the 
front steps of the citycounty building in pittsburgh because that 
display also included a christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty 
which the court said produced an overall secular purpose 
the ruling came on the final day of this court session along with 
a longawaiting decision on the controversial abortion issue 
in the abortion case the justices gave states far greater power 
to limit abortions but stopped short of reversing their 1973 
decision legalizing abortion they also agreed to hear three other 
abortion cases from minnesota illinois and ohio when the 
courts next term begins in october 
in other actions the court 
accepting its firstever right to die case agreed to decide 
whether a missouri family may order removal of a lifesupport system 
from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition 
agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student 
religious groups be given the same access as other extracurricular 
clubs to public high school facilities the justices will decide 
whether a bible study group must be allowed to meet at an omaha 
neb high school after class hours 
ordered a battle over state taxing powers reargued on broader 
issues next term related cases from arkansas and florida raise the 
issue of whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax 
as a burden on interstate commerce is entitled to a refund of 
previously paid taxes 
the court said the menorah a ninebranched candelabra used 
during the celebration of the jewish holiday hanukkah does not 
appear to endorse judaism because of its particular physical 
setting 
the inclusion of the christmas tree and sign saluting liberty 
give the overall display a secular purpose the court said 
while the justices were split sharply in declaring the nativity 
scene unconstitutional the court substantially upheld its longused 
test for determining when the wall between church and state is 
breached 
justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in 
striking down the nativity scene by justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor 
justice anthony m kennedy participating in his first 
churchstate case since joining the court in 1988 dissented in 
voting to permit the nativity scene 
the other dissenters were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
thank god for the supreme court said charles saul a 
pittsburgh attorney representing a jewish group which owned the 
menorah the court is saying that when you put a menorah and a 
christmas tree and these kinds of things together that all faiths 
are welcome and that the government is not endorsing one particular 
religion 
blackmun said the nativity scene or creche violates the 
constitution because nothing in the context of the display 
detracts from the creches religious message 
that message blackmun said is spelled out unmistakably in the 
display 
glory to god in the highest says the angel in the creche 
glory to god because of the birth of jesus he said this praise 
to god in christian terms is indisputably religious indeed 
sectarian 
by contrast he said display containing the menorah includes 
symbols that support the nations pluralist tradition 
the citys overall display must be understood as conveying the 
citys secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating 
the winter holiday season he said 
kennedy said the court in barring goverment sponsorship of the 
creche showed an unjustified hostility toward religion a 
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents 
todays ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the 
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in pawtucket ri 
the creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such 
as santa claus reindeer and snowmen 
the pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself 
justice department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the 
pittsburgh displays contending since the use of the creche as a 
symbol of the holiday does not constitute a government endorsement 
of the religious content of that symbol the government is not 
required to surround it with candy canes reindeer or other purely 
secular symbols 
lower courts across the nation have been confused about just 
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental 
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional 
promotion or advancement of religion 
most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one 
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious 
blackmun acknowledged today that the 1984 ruling is none too 
clear but he said todays ruling may help dispel the confusion 
he said these are the guiding principles the governments use 
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of 
endorsing religious beliefs and the effect of the governments use 
of religious symoblism depends upon its context 
in pittsburgh from 1981 to 1987 a 9footwide creche depicting 
the birth of jesus christ was displayed inside the county courthouse 
in the city for about six weeks during the christmas season 
a block away an 18foot menorah was displayed each year from 
1982 to 1987 on the front steps f the building that houses city and 
county offices it stood next to a 45foot christmas tree 
a federal judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays 
in late 1987 but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled by a 
21 vote that they were unlawful that ruling prevented the 
displays being shown last christmas season 
the creche is owned by the holy name society a roman catholic 
mens group that arranges for its display the menorah is owned by 
chabad a small jewish sect that loaned the symbol to the city free 
of charge 
the legal controversy began when the american civil liberties 
union asked for removal of the creche and menorah in 1986 the 
request was denied 
the aclu several lawyers who conduct business at the courthouse 
a unitarian minister and a moslem then sued seeking to block the 
displays

in the hindu kush mountains 
shattered crumbling huts tell tales their inhabitants probably 
never will of the savagery that turned thousands of villages into 
graveyards 
families that tilled the orchards and fields for unknown 
generations have disappeared the silence is broken by an occasional 
burst of gunfire or a military convoy roaring through the valleys 
where shattered villages cling to the 15000foot mountains like an 
image of armageddon 
what happened to villages like lalma babagilala babamardan and 
babashangrul will not be known until the war between the government 
and moslem guerrillas ends and accounts can be pieced together from 
villagers who escaped 
after a decade of war the barbarity has become widely known but 
in the hindu kush mountains along the river valleys and across the 
plains where the armies of alexander the great and genghis khan once 
marched the scenes of devastation go beyond what was previously 
known about the conflict 
international relief workers fear they are only beginning to 
learn of the destruction wrought on the rebelcontrolled countryside 
there are black holes places no one has been for years and 
probably wont get to until the war is over but if what we know now 
is a barometer of the level of destruction this war has been almost 
genocidal said one international aid worker speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
according to asif zahir minister of planning and reconstruction 
at least half the countrys 35500 villages have been bombed 
shelled and rocketed into oblivion fields orchards and irrigation 
canals vital to this agriculturally dependent society are in ruins 
once peace is restored relief workers say it will take years 
and billions of dollars to bring what was already one of the worlds 
poorest countries back to the point it was in april 1978 when 
marxists seized power and civil war broke out 
government and military officials say the devastation occurred 
progressively over 11 years of fighting as the guerrillas occupied 
the villages and the afghan army and soviet troops sent in to help 
battled to uproot them 
across afghanistan in villages and towns of the western 
southern and eastern provinces the conflict has destroyed all 
semblance of civilized living entire districts lie in rubble 
schools medical facilities and public utilities have disappeared 
soldiers of the sovietbacked kabul government say much of the 
destruction occurred in the final weeks before feb 15 when the 
kremlin withdrew the last of its troops from afghanistan 
fearing attacks on retreating convoys by guerrillas hiding in the 
villages the soviets ordered bombing raids and artillery barrages 
on the villages and other suspected guerrilla hideouts along the 
departure routes 
those that were lucky got out and those that couldnt probably 
died brig gen mohammad shafi who commands the second infantry 
division said in a matteroffact tone 
after the red army was gone the usbacked guerrillas slipped 
back to their posts the afghan army mounted another offensive and 
forced the rebels to retreat into the snowcovered mountains a 
second time 
the enemy used to be here we had to come and punish them and 
destroy their hideouts said shafi pointing to the ruins around 
haijan scene of some of the fiercest battles since the soviet 
pullout 
along the sinuous salang highway which climbs through the hindu 
kush and winds north toward the soviet union soldiers now stand 
guard at military outposts interspersed with hundreds of burned out 
tanks and armored personnel carriers 
but the wreckage littering the road and the hulks of tanks and 
trucks blasted into the icy rushing water of the salang river are 
little compared to the destruction that lies above the road 
relief workers estimate it will take at least 1 billion to start 
rebuilding and billions of dollars more for several years 
zahir the reconstruction minister predicts most reconstruction 
could be completed within five years but he added that some things 
can never be replaced 
you cant rebuild a society with mere money there are many 
values that have been destroyed by this war he said 
you can always rebuild a road or a well of a piece of land but 
millions of people some of the brightest minds in afghanistan have 
left how do you bring them back more than a million afghans have 
died we cannot revive them

officials at the clinic that figured in todays 
supreme court abortion ruling called the decision the beginning of 
a war that will be fought for years to come 
this is a serious serious setback for women and families in 
this country said judith widdicombe founder of reproductive 
health services the clinic that challenged a 1986 missouri law 
which imposed a variety of restrictions on a womans right to obtain 
an abortion this is an outrage 
theres a movement in this country that will not tolerate this 
it will become our vietnam of the 1990s 
missouri gov john ashcroft hailed todays ruling saying that 
by beginning the dismemberment of roe vs wade the supreme court 
gives the american people greater ability to save innocent lives 
thats something missourians take very seriously 
the high court stopped short of overturning its 1973 roe vs wade 
decision which barred the states from outlawing abortion 
state attorney general william webster who was the chief 
defendant in a suit brought by reproductive health services 
challenging the law called the decision a great victory but 
declined further comment until he had read the full text of the 
opinion 
jane 30 a st louis woman who had an abortion earlier this 
year was at the clinic for the announcement of the decision 
this is going to go on and on said jane who asked that her 
real name not be used and the quiet silent majority is going to 
have to speak up every organization thats prochoice is going to 
have to fight a thousand times harder its like dominoes if you 
give up once they keep falling down one by one 
she said the restrictions are going to cause abortions to cost 
more and become more difficult to get 
its clear that in missouri a woman is not going to have the 
option that i had a couple of months ago said jane 
widdicombe said she did not believe the antiabortion movement 
would be satisfied with the tighter restrictions on abortions 
their goal is no abortions widdicombe said next will come 
birth control 
she said her main fear now was that the legislature would 
interpret the supreme court ruling as restrictively as possible 
mary bryant of planned parenthood who lobbied against missouris 
1986 law said she expected an avalanche of legislation 
introduced in missouri that would attempt to even further restrict 
abortions in the state 
in todays decision the justices restored missouri regulations 
that 
require doctors to determine when possible whether a fetus at 
least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving outside the womb by 
testing lung capacity and conducting other tests 
ban the use of tax money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions not necessary to save life 
ban any public employee doctor nurse or other health care 
provider to perform or assist an abortion not necessary to save a 
womans life 
ban the use of any public hospital or other facility for 
performing abortions not necessary to save life 
the decision also upheld the constitutionality of a declaration 
in missouri law that the life of each human being begins at 
conception

the 18 millionmember united church of 
christ today elected a president and decided whether to move its 
headquarters 
results of the balloting this morning by delegates to the uccs 
17th general synod were not immediately available 
the 703 delegates were asked to decide whether to combine the 
denominations national offices now scattered in three new york 
city locations into a single new york location or move them to 
cleveland 
other protestant denominations have moved from new york in recent 
years 
the rev yvonne delk of union city nj faced the rev paul h 
sherry of chicago for president raising the possibility that the 
ucc one of the most liberal of the mainline churches would elect 
the first woman president of a major protestant group 
while the ucc president has no doctrinal power over the 
denominations members the position is widely viewed as an 
important theological platform 
supporters of the move to cleveland say it would save millions in 
rent and other costs and bridge a symbolic gap between the national 
and local church 
critics say a move from new york would diminish the uccs 
standing in the ecumenical community 
the ohio delegation with more than 70 people is the synods 
largest and it has lobbied hard for a move to cleveland 
the denomination was formed in the 1957 merger of the 
congregational christian churches and the evangelical and reformed 
church 
in 1987 after the new yorkbased united presbyterian church 
usa merged with the atlantabased presbyterian church us 
the new presbyterian church usa set itself up in louisville ky 
three lutheran denominations including the new yorkbased 
lutheran church in america merged in 1987 and established 
headquarters in chicago

the supreme courts decision today to cut back 
womens constitutional rights to abortion doesnt end the matter 
other action taken court ensures that abortion will dominate the 
courts 198990 term as well 
the court in its final day of the 198889 term agreed to review 
abortion controversies from illinois ohio and minnesota during the 
session that begins in october 
the illinois case clearly poses the largest direct threat to roe 
vs wade it would be extremely difficult for the court to revive 
the illinois laws without substantially dismantling its 1973 
decision 
the illinois case stems from that states attempt to enforce 
extensive regulations on abortion clinics 
lower courts said three illinois laws when applied to abortion 
clinics impermissibly interfered with womens abortion rights 
a federal trial judge and the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
said the regulations imposed by the illinois laws would have forced 
abortion clinics to become the functional equivalent of small 
hospitals for no valid purpose 
the three laws the medical practice act the ambulatory 
surgical treatment center act and the health facilities providers 
act generally apply to all medical centers where outpatient 
surgery is performed 
the regulations covered staffing and equipment requirements and 
even the size of the facility 
one regulation required patient counseling that included a 
discussion of alternatives description of the procedure to be 
performed and an explanation of risks and possible complications 
the ohio abortion law generally required doctors to notify a 
parent of young unmarried girls before performing abortions 
lower courts said the law impermissibly interfered with some 
girls constitutional right to seek an abortion 
passed by the states legislature in 1985 the ohio law never 
took effect due to a successful legal challenge by an akron abortion 
clinic and one of its doctors 
the law would have required any doctor asked to perform an 
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girls 
parents at least 24 hours before the operation 
doctors could satisfy the laws notification requirement by 
telling the girls brother or sister if over 21 or a designated 
stepparent or grandparent 
young girls could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking 
the permission of a state judge to have an abortion 
among other flaws found by the lower courts was the fact that 
ohio had made no showing that its interest in protecting immature 
minors is advanced by requiring the attending physician as opposed 
to another qualified responsible person to do the notifying 
the minnesota law at issue requires some girls to tell both 
parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion it was upheld 
by a federal appeals court 
the minnesota legislature passed a law in 1981 requiring 
unmarried girls under 18 and still living with a parent to provide 
written notice to both parents if possible before obtaining an 
abortion 
the law also imposed a 48hour waiting period and made doctors 
who perform abortions criminally liable for violations 
after a judge blocked enforcement of the law a judicial bypass 
option took effect it allowed girls to avoid notifying their 
parents by convincing a judge they were mature and capable of 
giving informed consent or that an abortion without notice to both 
parents would serve the girls best interest 
the notification law with the judicial bypass option was in 
effect in minnesota for five years before a federal judge ruled that 
it was unconstitutional 
the law had been challenged in behalf of minors a parent four 
abortion clinics and two doctors 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld that ruling but the entire appeals court last aug 8 upheld 
the law by a 73 vote 
the 8th circuit court postponed the effect of its ruling so 
opponents of the law could seek supreme court review 
the high court previously has upheld a states parental 
notification law but it never before has handled a case involving 
such a law that had been in effect

losses of more than 20 percent of produce before the goods reach the 
market 
we have asked a number of ministries including defense to 
help out gorbachev said several military plants are being 
converted to civilian use to help ease food and consumer goods 
shortages 
details of fridays conference of the communist partys 
policymaking central committee were published monday in the party 
newspaper pravda 
further increases of agriculture production is senseless unless 
we deal with processing since much of the produce is lost he 
said 
gorbachev said entrenched party bosses were hampering 
agricultural reform particularly lease farming approved by the 
central committee in march 
there are opponents to lease farming when they cannot 
intimidate those people who are not afraid of responsibility and 
hard work they offer such conditions of lease that there is no way 
for anyone to agree to them he said 
under the march reforms farmers who till land owned by the state 
were allowed to lease the property from the state for 50 years with 
the right to pass it on to descendants officials say the program 
has started slowly in part because of bureaucratic meddling 
gorbachev said party bosses who obstruct reform should be dealt 
with at the regional level party bodies should not be afraid of 
those communist leaders who are doing harm to our cause because it 
does harm both to the cause and party credibility 
ligachev said diverting military resources to civilian use could 
help get more food into the shops defense ministries are expected 
to provide sophisticated uptodate equipment for food industries 
because of their general efficiency they have been given that task 
it is well known the country has shortages of many things 
unfortunately there is no shortage of rhetoric labels and 
sometimes libel he said 
ligachev said government critics were demanding the land be 
turned over to farmers 
at the same time it appears that in real life the vast 
majority of farmers do not want to take that land and leave 
collective and state farms he said 
the deputy chairman of the georgian republics council of 
ministers guram d mgeladze said farmers were unwilling to risk 
leaving secure jobs on state farms for leased land because they 
have been deceived so many times

the supreme court today rejected appeals by 
hispanics challenging floridas designation of english as the 
states official language 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that an election 
giving officiallanguage status to english did not violate the 
federal voting rights act 
florida voters last nov 8 approved the proposal by an 8416 
percent margin the initiative amended the state constitution and 
left it up to the florida legislature to implement the change 
voters in colorado and arizona approved similar measures the same 
day bringing to at least 17 the number of states that have passed 
laws or adopted constitutional amendments designating english as the 
official language 
the other states are arkansas california georgia hawaii 
illinois indiana kentucky mississippi nebraska north carolina 
north dakota south carolina tennessee and virginia 
spearheading the drive for such measures is a group calling 
itself us english which also has been urging congress to make 
english the nations official language 
the ballot proposal in florida was challenged on grounds that 
petitions seeking signatures to place the initiative on the ballot 
were not translated into spanish in six of the states 67 counties 
covered by the federal voting rights act 
the law requires a state that distributes materials or 
information relating to the electoral process to provide a 
bilingual translation for minority groups in covered areas 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that 
florida officials did not violate the law 
the appeals court said the law does not apply to initiative 
petitions and in floridas case the involvement by state officials 
was marginal 
the state officials had a ministerial role in placing the 
initiative on the ballot but were not responsible for the drive that 
collected signatures on the petitions the appeals court said 
congress has never shown any intent to expand coverage of 
the voting rights act to materials distributed by private 
citizens the appeals court said it is hard to imagine that in 
passing the act congress could have intended that private citizens 
seeking to further their own political goals through the initiative 
petition process be subject to specific language requirements 
the appeals court upheld a ruling by a federal judge who said the 
initiative was legal 
the 11th circuit court also rejected arguments that the judge 
lacked authority to rule in the case opponents of the initiative 
said the voting rights act requires that the dispute be decided 
initially by a special threejudge federal court not a lone judge 
leaders in south floridas latin community said approval of the 
initiative touched off an increase in antihispanic incidents 
the cases are delgado vs smith 881327 and in re delgado 
881329

the supreme court today told a federal appeals 
court to restudy a lawsuit accusing billionaire hotel owner harry 
helmsley and his business partners of fraud in connection with a new 
york city condominium conversion 
the justices said the 2nd us circuit court of appeals should 
restudy helmsleys case in light of their june 26 ruling in a 
minnesota telephone rates case 
the appeals court ruled that helmsley and the others may be sued 
under a federal law the racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act or rico 
the appeals court last january ruled that the law permits five 
tenants of the parkchester condominium complex in the bronx to sue 
on grounds the business partners concealed structural defects in the 
buildings the presence of asbestos in insulation and the need to 
replace electrical systems 
the appeals court said the accusations constitute a pattern of 
racketeering activity as defined by the rico statute 
the supreme court issued a similar ruling june 26 the justices 
said a single fraudulent scheme that has the threat of continuing 
illegal activities is covered by the 19yearold law 
the high court also said the law is aimed at more than the 
traditional forms of organized crime and may target fraudulent 
business activities as well 
the case acted on today is separate from a federal indictment 
against helmsley his wife leona and two of their former aides 
mrs helmsley is accused in that case of evading taxes by billing 
personal luxuries as business expenses 
her husband who is 80 has been found incompetent to stand trial 
on the criminal charges because of memory loss and reasoning 
problems caused by several slight strokes 
opening arguments in the criminal case were scheduled for 
wednesday in federal court in new york city 
the case acted on today is helmsley vs beauford 881523

the supreme court ruled today that some 
governmentsponsored religious displays are permissible as long as 
they do not have the effect of promoting or endorsing religious 
beliefs 
by a 54 vote the court said displaying a christmas nativity 
scene inside the allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh violates 
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it 
appears to endorse christian principles 
but the court unanimously permitted a hanukkah menorah on the 
front steps of the citycounty building in pittsburgh because that 
display also included a christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty 
which the court said produced an overall secular purpose 
the ruling came on the final day of this court session along with 
a longawaiting decision on the controversial abortion issue 
in the abortion case the justices gave states far greater power 
to limit abortions but stopped short of reversing their 1973 
decision legalizing abortion they also agreed to hear three other 
abortion cases from minnesota illinois and ohio when the 
courts next term begins in october 
in other actions the court 
accepting its firstever right to die case agreed to decide 
whether a missouri family may order removal of a lifesupport system 
from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition 
agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student 
religious groups be given the same access as other extracurricular 
clubs to public high school facilities the justices will decide 
whether a bible study group must be allowed to meet at an omaha 
neb high school after class hours 
ordered a battle over state taxing powers reargued on broader 
issues next term related cases from arkansas and florida raise the 
issue of whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax 
as a burden on interstate commerce is entitled to a refund of 
previously paid taxes 
rejected appeals by hispanics challenging floridas designation 
of english as the states official language 
without comment rejected arguments that the government 
unlawfully tried to silence political extremist lyndon larouche who 
was convicted with six others in a scheme to defraud lenders of more 
than 30 million 
told the 2nd us circuit court of appeals to restudy a a 
lawsuit accusing billionaire hotel owner harry helmsley and his 
business partners of fraud in connection with a new york city 
condominium conversion 
the court said the menorah a ninebranched candelabra used 
during the celebration of the jewish holiday hanukkah does not 
appear to endorse judaism because of its particular physical 
setting 
the inclusion of the christmas tree and sign saluting liberty 
give the overall display a secular purpose the court said 
while the justices were split sharply in declaring the nativity 
scene unconstitutional the court substantially upheld its longused 
test for determining when the wall between church and state is 
breached 
justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in 
striking down the nativity scene by justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor 
justice anthony m kennedy participating in his first 
churchstate case since joining the court in 1988 dissented in 
voting to permit the nativity scene 
the other dissenters were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
thank god for the supreme court said charles saul a 
pittsburgh attorney representing a jewish group which owned the 
menorah the court is saying that when you put a menorah and a 
christmas tree and these kinds of things together that all faiths 
are welcome and that the government is not endorsing one particular 
religion 
blackmun said the nativity scene or creche violates the 
constitution because nothing in the context of the display 
detracts from the creches religious message 
that message blackmun said is spelled out unmistakably in the 
display 
glory to god in the highest says the angel in the creche 
glory to god because of the birth of jesus he said this praise 
to god in christian terms is indisputably religious indeed 
sectarian 
by contrast he said display containing the menorah includes 
symbols that support the nations pluralist tradition 
the citys overall display must be understood as conveying the 
citys secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating 
the winter holiday season he said 
kennedy said the court in barring goverment sponsorship of the 
creche showed an unjustified hostility toward religion a 
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents 
todays ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the 
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in pawtucket ri 
the creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such 
as santa claus reindeer and snowmen 
the pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself 
justice department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the 
pittsburgh displays contending since the use of the creche as a 
symbol of the holiday does not constitute a government endorsement 
of the religious content of that symbol the government is not 
required to surround it with candy canes reindeer or other purely 
secular symbols 
lower courts across the nation have been confused about just 
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental 
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional 
promotion or advancement of religion 
most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one 
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious 
blackmun acknowledged today that the 1984 ruling is none too 
clear but he said todays ruling may help dispel the confusion 
he said these are the guiding principles the governments use 
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of 
endorsing religious beliefs and the effect of the governments use 
of religious symoblism depends upon its context 
in pittsburgh from 1981 to 1987 a 9footwide creche depicting 
the birth of jesus christ was displayed inside the county courthouse 
in the city for about six weeks during the christmas season 
a block away an 18foot menorah was displayed each year from 
1982 to 1987 on the front steps f the building that houses city and 
county offices it stood next to a 45foot christmas tree 
a federal judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays 
in late 1987 but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled by a 
21 vote that they were unlawful that ruling prevented the 
displays being shown last christmas season 
the creche is owned by the holy name society a roman catholic 
mens group that arranges for its display the menorah is owned by 
chabad a small jewish sect that loaned the symbol to the city free 
of charge 
the legal controversy began when the american civil liberties 
union asked for removal of the creche and menorah in 1986 the 
request was denied 
the aclu several lawyers who conduct business at the courthouse 
a unitarian minister and a moslem then sued seeking to block the 
displays

the longgoverning institutional 
revolutionary party claimed victory today in four states after 
regional elections that raised outcries of fraud from both the 
incumbent party and its opponents 
though the governing party said its candidate won the baja 
california governors race the challenger said partial returns 
indicated he was leading 
the institutional revolutionary party known as pri claimed 
victory in 10 of 18 legislative districts in michoacan state where 
it was gauging its strength after losing to the left in general 
elections last july 
the centrist pri said it swept voting in chihuahua and zacatecas 
states and held strong leads in the chihuahua mayoral races in 
ciudad juarez and the city of chihuahua itself 
returns were not yet available in campeche state 
the elections tested the pledge of president carlos salinas de 
gortari to end fraudulent elections and respect opposition victories 
however opposition parties charged that the pri inflated voter 
registration lists sent groups of voters to cast ballots in several 
polling places and cheated in other ways 
congressman norberto corrella of the conservative national action 
party or pan told reporters today he spent all night recovering 
stolen ballot boxes and filing complaints with the district 
attorneys office in mexicali the capital of baja california 
we recovered 17 ballot boxes that were taken away he said 
alleging that deputies appointed by local election boards stole the 
boxes from precincts where their party was losing these deputies 
appeared hours later at the electoral commission with a ballot box 
containing altered ballots and all of a sudden they are 
winning 10to1 he said 
promises by salinas and chihuahua gov fernando baeza of clean 
elections were just words said jesus hernandez a pan spokesman 
in ciudad juarez these elections were dirty 
however opposition party officials contacted in several states 
indicated that overall the irregularities were less widespread and 
serious than in the past 
incidents of direct violence were fewer but the institutional 
violence that is hidden by false documents is intact said pedro 
cesar acosta a pan spokesman in chihuahua state 
the pri had some of its own charges in michoacan jose 
guadarrama a member of the pri national committee accused 
opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas of campaigning at polling 
places in the state 
with 10 percent of the vote counted in the baja california 
governors race the victory of margarita ortega is clean and 
unchallengeable said eduardo manuel martinez palomera a pri 
district committee president 
but ernesto ruffo the pan challenger said a count of 25 percent 
of the vote by his party showed him winning 
a ruffo victory would hand the pri the first loss in a governors 
election in its 60year history 
the pri also said complete but unofficial results showed it had 
won or was leading in 10 other chihuahua mayoral races 
pan in baja california said its unofficial results indicated it 
was leading in ensenada where ruffo had been mayor and in tijuana 
the pri said it had no early returns for the cities 
official results were not expected for a week 
the liberal democratic revolutionary party in michoacan and the 
pan in chihuahua and baja california complained of irregularities in 
voter registration lists 
pan said the lists were padded by hundreds of thousands of names 
while names of opposition supporters vanished 
some people in michoacan showed reporters voter registration 
cards but said they had been told they were not on the lists and 
were not permitted to vote 
other critics said the indelible ink used to mark voters fingers 
to prevent them from voting more than once had been removed in some 
cases 
attempts to steal ballot boxes were reported in ciudad juarez and 
in baja california but both failed 
about half the eligible voters cast ballots in baja california 
the pri said while no figures were available opposition leaders in 
the other states said turnout was far lower

the supreme court today allowed the government 
to enforce antidumping regulations in a way foreign companies and 
importers of foreign goods say improperly impedes international 
trade 
the court without comment rejected a canadian steel producers 
appeal which was supported by an american exportimport association 
and an international consumers group 
algoma steel corp ltd of canada challenged a decision by the 
international trade commission a us agency responsible for 
enforcing some antidumping rules 
the commission said that canadian steel tubing was being dumped 
sold at below fair market value in the united states the 
commission said such sales were injuring or threatening injury to 
us industry 
the finding permits imposition of antidumping duties to penalize 
foreign companies and importers of the steel products 
the commerce department which shares responsibility for 
enforcing antidumping rules said some of algoma steels exports to 
the united states were sold above fair market value 
commerce officials said that over one sixmonth period more than 
half of algoma steels exports were sold above fair market value 
algoma steel said that fact in effect was ignored when the 
international trade commission determined dumped goods were causing 
injury to us industry 
the canadian company said any fairly traded products should be 
excluded from the commissions assessment 
but a federal appeals court here upheld the commissions finding 
in january ruling the commission did not act arbitrarily or 
capriciously when it included the fairly trade goods in its 
calculations 
many such fairly traded sales might be the best evidence 
possible that the lessthanfairvalue sales had served their 
purpose and the united states competitor was in full retreat the 
appeals court said it is therefore not at all obvious that the 
morethanfairvalue sales are automatically legally irrelevant 
algoma steels appeal was supported by the american association 
of exporters and importers representing 1200 us companies 
involved in international trade 
the inclusion of fairly traded imports to decide injury in a 
dumping case blurs the distinction between fair trade and unfair 
trade thereby penalizing honest us importers who follow 
internationally acceptable practices the association said 
also backing the appeal was consumers for world trade which said 
us trade law was being misused to erect protectionist barriers 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal 
the case is algoma steel vs us 881781

levels and other information some collecting data at 7 am local 
time others between 5 pm and 6 pm local time 
their information is compiled with readings taken at national 
weather service offices and by observers around the world to

noaa annually honors its volunteer observers selecting five for 
the thomas jefferson award named for the third president who was 
an avid weather observer

the african national congress 
guerrilla group has ordered a halt to attacks that are likely to 
harm innocent civilians according to a group of whites who returned 
today from talks with the rebels 
the delegation also said the anc said it will not oppose white 
antiapartheid candidates in national elections because it thinks 
they could make a difference in parliament 
several western countries including the united states and 
denmark paid for the meeting between 115 white south africans and 
the 85 members of the anc the largest of the exiled guerrilla 
organizations fighting to overthrow the white minority government in 
south africa most anc members are black 
it was the largest group of white south africans to have talks 
with the anc 
the anc tends to be demonized in this country which is a very 
serious problem considering we are going to need to negotiate with 
them in the future said gael neke an executive member of the 
five freedoms forum which organized the conference in lusaka 
zambia the meeting began thursday and ended sunday 
ms neke said a major topic at the conference was the ancs use 
of violence particularly limpet mines and car bombs aimed at 
targets in which civilians are more likely to be hurt than the 
military or police 
these include restaurants sports stadiums public toilets and 
trash cans 
some delegates expressed dissaproval of this policy and were told 
by anc delegates that orders went out last year to end such 
violence she said adding that in fact it has stopped 
there have been 28 bombings in south africa this year with 20 
injuries most of the recent bombs have been placed under police 
vehicles or at the homes of politicians 
the most serious occurred june 11 when a bomb exploded under a 
parked police van at a soccer stadium in a black township injuring 
three black teenagers and a 20yearold man 
the white delegation chief mike olivier said the anc members 
including president oliver tambo and south african communist party 
leader joe slovo said some white antiapartheid members of 
parliament could make a difference although the organization 
believes parliament as a whole is not representative of south 
africans 
he said the anc representatives would not call for a boycott of 
the sept 6 parliamentary elections for the white house of assembly 
but they would continue to condemn voting in elections for the 
indian and mixedrace houses because the anc contends most people 
in those communities do not vote and the elected members are 
therefore not representative 
under law blacks have no vote in national affairs 
olivier said the anc insisted that certain conditions must exist 
in south africa before it is willing to negotiate with the south 
african government those conditions include the release of 
political prisoners legalization of the anc and other 
antiapartheid political organizations the lifting of the national 
state of emergency the return of exiles to south africa and 
withdrawal of soldiers from black townships 
another five freedoms forum member gavin evans said anc 
delegates indicated if those conditions were met on entering into 
a period of negotiations they would be prepared to suspend 
violence 
he said the delegates didnt discuss what suspend meant

antiabortion groups today hailed the supreme 
courts abortion ruling as a major victory while prochoice 
advocates said greater restrictions on the right to end a pregnancy 
will send women into back alleys 
we are smiling we are thumbs up all the way john willke of 
the national right to life committee said shortly after the courts 
divided ruling that expanded state authority to restrict abortions 
womens rights in every state are now in jeopardy said 
judith l lichtman president of the womens legal defense fund 
women across the country are outraged that this fundamental right 
can be taken away 
in its ruling the court stopped short of overturning a historic 
1973 decision that granted women the right to abortions but it 
permitted the state of missouri to enforce several provisions 
designed to restrict abortions not necessary to save life and 
opened the way for other states to follow suit 
the court also said it would hear two new abortion cases next 
term 
sen orrin hatch rutah a key abortion opponent in congress 
called the decision a major victory for the prolife cause 
judith widdecombe founder of reproductive health services the 
missouri clinic involved in the court case said theres a 
movement in this country that will not tolerate this it will become 
our vietnam of the 1990s 
this ruling will sentence thousands of teenagers each year to 
bear children they are not ready emotionally physically or 
financially to raise said the center for population options 
lori schroyer spokeswoman for the california abortion rights 
action league said access to abortion is going to be limited to 
those of privilege it will force people across state lines and into 
back alleys 
patricia schroeder dcolo said the decision made women wards 
of the state their rights are all dependent on what states decide 
to do and i think thats a very sad day for americas families 
young people and everyone else whos concerned about rights and 
choices 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said the decision chips away at abortion rights noting the 
cases still to be heard she said the court will have more 
opportunities to limit abortion rights until pretty soon nothing 
much will be left for a woman in controlling her reproductive life 
sen gordon humphrey rnh who calls abortion the greatest 
human rights violation in history said the ruling is the first 
big step toward overturning roe vs wade and another step toward the 
end of the killing of prenatal infants 
olivia gans a spokeswoman for the national right to life 
committee said the decision recognized that the states have an 
interest in protecting the life of the unborn child 
this is a very important day for our group were talking about 
allowing the people of america the decision whether or not they are 
comfortable with allowing abortion on demand she said 
but susan liss director of people for the american way said the 
ruling paves the way for a state by state bloodletting that could 
be among the most painful in our history 
abortionrights groups said the ruling shifts the battlefield on 
the issue from the courts to the political arena and promised to 
make abortion an issue in elections throughout the country 
every person who stands for election in this country is going 
to have to answer yard said 
lichtman said the handwriting is on the wall we can no longer 
depend on the courts to protect this fundamental right of women to 
make the most private and intimate decisions about their 
reproductive lives 
randall terry founder and national director of operation rescue 
said the decision opens the door to a reversal of roe vs wade 
its a faltering step under which children will continue to be 
murdered but this decision indicates that roes days are 
numbered said terry whose organization is known for its protests 
outside abortion clinics 
but sarah weddington a dallas attorney who successfully argued 
the roe vs wade case in 1973 said that while the decision is 
effective immediately said it will have no practical implication 
until state legislatures pass new laws 
so in terms of is abortion legal or illegal in the various 
states tomorrow its going to be the same as today but what we are 
going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative activity in all of 
the state legislatures depending on which ones are in session and 
which ones are not she said 
despite that reassurance many women appeared to be fearing the 
worst 
at womens health services inc a pittsburgh abortion clinic 
executive director sue roselle said the telephones are ringing 
off the hook women are saying i want my abortion now before they 
change the law 
women will mourn this day said janet benshoof of the 
american civil liberties union the right of privacy should be 
secured by the constitution american women should not have their 
rights up to a vote in every state legislature 
the national abortion federation said that whether a woman can 
exercise her constitutional right to abortion will increasingly 
depend on where she lives how much money she has and how far she is 
able to travel

here is a chronology of the supreme courts 
major abortion decisions 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs wade the court for the first time 
legalized abortion nationwide the court in an opinion by justice 
harry a blackmun based its 72 ruling on a womans constitutional 
right to privacy 
the court said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may impose certain regulations during the second 
trimester to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester state authority to 
regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute 
however 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs bolton the court that same day struck 
down by a 72 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to 
perform abortions the decision gave rise to a new kind of medical 
facility the abortion clinic 
july 1 1976 in planned parenthood vs danforth the court by 
a 63 vote said states cannot give husbands veto power over their 
pregnant wives decision to abort their pregnancies by a 54 vote 
the court said that neither can parents of minor unwed girls be 
given an absolute veto over abortions 
june 20 1977 in maher vs roe the court ruled 63 that states 
have no legal obligation to pay for nontherapeutic abortions 
jan 9 1979 in colautti vs franklin reached by a 63 vote 
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion 
in determining the timing of fetal viability when a fetus can 
live outside the mothers womb the justices said states may seek to 
protect a fetus that has reached viability but the determination is 
up to doctors not courts or legislatures 
july 2 1979 in bellotti vs baird the court by an 81 vote 
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976 it implied that 
states may be able to require a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain 
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an 
alternative procedure to parental approval such as letting the 
minor seek a state judges approval instead 
june 30 1980 in harris vs mcrae the socalled hyde amendment 
was upheld by a 54 vote the court said the federal government and 
individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even 
medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare 
march 23 1981 in hl vs matheson the court ruled by a 63 
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls those 
still dependent on their parents and too immature to decide such 
matters for themselves to try to inform parents before performing 
a requested abortion 
june 15 1983 in three decisions called city of akron vs akron 
center for reproductive health planned parenthood of kansas city 
vs ashcroft and simopolous vs virginia the court in a 63 
ruling said states and local communities may not require that all 
abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in 
a hospital 
the court also struck down regulations that among other things 
imposed a 24hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion 
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell 
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a human life 
june 11 1986 in thornburgh vs american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the court voted 54 to strike down 
pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it 
invalidated in 1983 the court said states may not require doctors 
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about 
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and 
childbirth 
in that decision the court also struck down requirements that 
doctors performing thirdtrimester abortions which are rare use 
procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the 
womb and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed 
in the third trimester also invalidated was a regulation requiring 
doctors to make a record which could become available to the 
public of every abortion they perform 
dec 14 1987 in hartigan vs zbaraz the court split 44 the 
effect was to invalidate an illinois law that could have made 
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the decision was announced two months before justice anthony m 
kennedy joined the court and replaced justice lewis f powell who 
had retired the previous june 
july 3 1989 in a series of votes on webster vs reproductive 
health services the court provided states with new authority to 
limit a womans right to abortion but stopped short of reversing its 
1973 decision legalizing abortion 
the justices restored key provisions of a law that a lower court 
had invalidated for unduly interfering with the constitutional right 
to abortion 
the overall effect was to allow missouri to restrict the use of 
public money medical personnel or facilities in performing abortion 
procedures 
one ruling requires doctors to determine when possible whether 
a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving outside the 
womb by testing lung capacity and conducting other tests 
other states now may follow missouris lead the court also 
appeared to invite further challenges to its 1973 ruling

the push for democratic change in such places 
as eastern europe and china comes about mainly from two major 
changes around the globe says a television documentary producer 
whose study of democracy begins next week on the public broadcasting 
system 
the major factors are increasing international trade and the 
increasingly widespread and electronic delivery of information 
patrick watson a veteran canadian producer said in a telephone 
interview as you increase the contact among people and increase 
the flow of information you get a push for democracy 
watson turned his threeyear 30nation project into a 10hour 
10part series the struggle for democracy which will begin 
airing july 11 on pbs stations 
watson is particularly interested in china where in 1964 he 
produced and directed the seven hundred million the first film 
by a north american since the communists took over the worlds most 
populous nation eight years ago he hosted a canadian broadcasting 
corporation series the chinese 
as he sees it the bloody repression last month of students in 
beijing resulted from the threats to the aging chinese leadership 
represented by the young intellectuals 
actually the students are not particularly popular in china 
he said if there were an election the students would be rejected 
because the government has so tightly controlled the flow of 
information over the years and has succeeded in painting outside 
influences as subversive 
no reforms are likely in china until the current leadership dies 
out or looses power he said when the old guard goes youll 
likely see a push for change that will primarily take the form of 
economic reforms because the economy has such trouble 
that push in turn will open up trade and contact with 
outsiders and increase prosperity and that will begin the process 
of change watson said but it will be very slow in the near 
term youll see some softening up of the harsh process that youve 
seen lately but it will be a very long time and a very long road 
before you see any real change 
watson said his project taught him that democracy wears a 
different face in whatever culture it exists 
if the soviets or the chinese do some type of democracy north 
americans will likely look at it and say that it doesnt look at all 
like ours but it may actually turn out to be a very functional 
democracy for that culture he said 
the prime factors needed for democracy according to the 
producer are a reasonable level of prosperity and economic 
stability it doesnt mean that democracy will occur if you have 
those factors but they are preconditions 
another factor is some form of freedom of information 
it is absolutely essential to have an informed constituency 
watson said thats one of the things you saw in china where 
information was being faxed from the western nations back to 
beijing

where 444 american flags fly this fourth of 
july and all year round verna wagner teaches her grandchildren to 
count the 50 stars and 13 stripes and never burn the flag no matter 
what the supreme court ruled 
we want them to learn about our country and about what the flag 
stands for mrs wagner 63 said this weekend if they want to 
burn the flag wed tell them to go to cuba or iran where its okay 
to do it 
bill stratter 64 a former world war ii navy boatswains mate 
relaxing nearby at the veterans of foreign wars public golf course 
vowed never to let the colors burn for freedom of speech or anything 
else 
if you were desecrating the flag id probably shoot you if i 
had a gun in my hand he said 
old glory snaps rowonrow in the summer breeze at hillcrest 
memorial park cemetery where a new flag was raised each of the 444 
days american hostages were held in iran from nov 4 1979 to jan 
20 1981 
tom flynn owner of the 65acre cemetery later added a small 
bronze marker and a perpetual flame for eight american servicemen 
who died trying to rescue the hostages in 1980 
one former hostage still returns occasionally and daily a few 
tourists or residents of this city of about 17500 people near ohio 
stop by lately newly hatched swans and mallards paddling in a 
shallow pool among the flags keep visiting children happy 
mrs wagners grandchildren jason jackson 3 and justin 2 
were encouraged to look skyward 
were very patriotic said their mother linda jackson i 
want them to know about the united states 
the flags are beautiful and sometimes its very inspiring 
here said cemetery superintendent jim bigler 40 who keeps each 
banner flying atop 18foot steel poles year round 
i never think of myself as a big giant patriot i stand at 
ballgames but i dont always sing bigler said 
the flag stands for 200 years of history good times and bad 
times lives lost and lives born he said its very 
disrespectful to burn it youre protesting all the things it stood 
for in one shot and it stands for too much 
don wilson 60 an army veteran of korea and manager of the vfw 
golf course said the supreme court went too far with last weeks 
54 ruling that flag burning is legal under the constitutions first 
amendment protections of freedom of speech 
i believe in the socalled civil rights but where does it 
stop wilson said when you burn the flag youre never going to 
have a peaceful demonstration people feel this deep down inside 
john kukol 66 incoming vfw commander and a navy veteran of 
world war ii said freedom of speech means its okay to call 
president bush an obscenity for example 
but dont start monkeying around with the flag buddy kukol 
said thats different 
i dont think our forefathers ever meant free speech to mean 
having commies burning the flag it just shows how stupid the 
supreme court is said robert price democratic mayor of adjacent 
sharon 
several residents said they agreed with bush in calling for a 
constitutional amendment to protect the flag from desecration 
if thats what it takes we ought to do it mrs wagner said 
okay the supreme court made the ruling wilson said but 
if enough people feel this way lets change the constitution we 
can overrule the supreme court 
but bigler said its easier to raise a flag than to amend the 
constitution to protect it 
i think you should be very cautious when youre amending the 
constitution you shouldnt rush into it willynilly he said 
but i guess if you just want to say wait a minute on this issue 
you could come out looking very bad very bad indeed

political extremist lyndon larouche and six 
others convicted in a scheme to defraud lenders of more than 30 
million lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the 
government unlawfully tried to silence larouches political movement 
larouche is serving a 15year federal prison sentence for mail 
fraud conspiracy and scheming to defraud the internal revenue 
service his codefendants were given either threeyear or fiveyear 
sentences 
us district judge albert v bryan jr in alexandria va 
rejected larouches claim that the government waged a politically 
motivated vendetta against the fourtime presidential candidate 
in sentencing the defendants last january bryan said larouches 
vendetta claim is errant nonsense 
the idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to 
anything that would warrant the government bringing a prosectuion to 
silence them just defies human experience the judge said 
prosecutors said larouche and the others conspired to default on 
some 34 million in loans from political supporters 
larouche has taken extreme views on a variety of issues for 
example he has supported a quarrantine of aids victims and has 
charged that queen elizabeth is involved in drug trafficking 
his political organization the national caucus of labor 
committees has its headquarters in leesburg va

housing construction fell for the fourth 
straight month in may but public building projects led overall 
construction spending to a 13 percent increase the government 
reported monday 
the commerce department said total private and public 
construction totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4213 
billion in may after falling 08 percent in april mays spending 
level was 33 percent above the pace of may 1988 
but private construction remained flat at 3351 billion at an 
annual rate following a 16 percent drop in april residential 
building was off 16 percent from april including a 25 percent 
drop in new housing units to an annual rate of 1386 billion 
the decline in new housing represented the fourth consecutive 
drop it included a 15 percent decrease in singlefamily homes to 
an annual rate of 115 billion and a 67 percent drop in multifamily 
units to 236 billion 
analysts believe the pace of residential building will pick up 
later this year as mortgage interest rates decline fixed rates 
peaked in march at an average of 1122 percent and fell to 1007 
percent by last week according to a survey by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
rates had been driven up by the federal reserve as it tightened 
credit in an attempt to halt inflation 
i think well see private construction numbers moving up again 
probably by the end of the summer as rates continue to fall said 
david berson chief ecnomist for the federal national mortgage 
association 
nonresidential construction spending rose 26 percent to an 
annual rate of 987 billion the department reported and berson 
said he expects that to continue as industry expands in anticipation 
of rising exports 
we would expect some improvement as firms try to meet export 
demands he said some of that will necessitate increased 
spending on new plants new industrial buildings 
public construction was up 67 percent in may to an annual rate 
of 862 billion despite a drop in the highway and street spending 
from 279 billion to 274 billion the conservation and 
development category more than doubled from 3 billion to 66 
billion 
that was probably due to one or two big construction projects 
that came on line and will go back down next month berson said 
berson said he expects overall public construction to remain flat 
for the remainder of the year because of federal budget constraints

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration whether it thinks a nebraska state agency should be 
able to test its employees for aids 
the court said it wants to hear what justice department lawyers 
think about rulings that blocked the agency from imposing mandatory 
blood testing of employees who come into direct contact with the 
mentally retarded people the agency serves 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will review the 
nebraska case until sometime in the courts 198990 term which 
begins in october 
the eastern nebraska human services agency in 1987 adopted a 
policy requiring certain employees to submit to blood testing for 
the virus associated with aids or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the virus most often is spread through close contact 
with blood blood products or semen from infected persons 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv discovered in france 
and the united states 
the nebraska agencys rationale for imposing aids testing is that 
retarded clients who engage in violent or aggressive conduct such 
as biting or scratching risk contracting the disease from an 
infected employee 
the policy also sought to test employees for hepatitis 
after employees of a fivecounty subagency called the eastern 
nebraska community office of retardation sued us district judge 
lyle strom barred enforcement of the policy 
the judge said the evidence showed that the risk of an agency 
staffer transmitting aids to a client assuming that any staffer is 
infected with the disease is extremely low approaching zero 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld stroms ruling last 
feb 6 
under the facts established in this case the district court 
properly enjoined the policy as an unreasonable search and seizure 
under the constitutions fourth amendment the appeals court 
said 
in the appeal acted on today the state agency urged the justices 
to create a special needs exception to the fourth amendments 
general ban on government searches and seizures in the absence of 
probable cause 
the appeal said the 8th circuit court ruling imposes an unduly 
stringent standard on the agency to justify the mandatory blood 
testing for ensuring a safe training and living environment 
for mentally retarded citizens 
the chief victims of aids have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users although a small percentage of cases are 
attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual 
contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of may 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 97193 americans 
of whom more than half or 56468 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids 
the case is eastern nebraska community office of retardation vs 
glover 881805

the ruling liberal democratic party battered by sex 
and bribery scandals lost the weekend municipal election in tokyo 
and appeared to be in a shaky position for parliamentary contests 
later this month 
the liberal democrats who have governed japan since 1955 
dropped nearly onethird of their 63 seats in the 128member tokyo 
metropolitan assembly 
national issues such as an unpopular new sales tax dominated 
the tokyo election and it was considered a sign of the partys 
prospects in the vote july 23 for half the seats in parliaments 
upper chamber 
if parliament is dissolved over public discontent with the 
government the large liberal democratic majority in the more 
powerful lower house also could be at risk later this year 
although the liberal democrats won 43 seats in the tokyo assembly 
in sundays election the opposition socialist party nearly tripled 
its strength to 29 
the tax and the question of political reform had their 
effect on our assemblymen said yasunosuke daigo an 11term 
liberal democratic member of the city assembly daigo a member 
since 1947 lost his seat 
ryutaro hashimoto party secretarygeneral described the result 
as a total defeat and said we must study it and use it as a 
lesson as we prepare for the national elections 
along with 29 socialist members up from 11 in the outgoing 
127seat assembly seven socialistbacked independent candidates 
were elected giving the party a total of 36 votes 
komei or clean government won 26 seats the communist party 14 
and the democratic socialist party three four minor parties got one 
seat each and independent candidates without socialist backing 
captured two seats 
opposition parties hold a combined 85 in the last assembly 
their total was just one more than the liberal democrats 
things are going to change said keiko chiba a member of the 
national parliaments upper house in a speech at socialist 
headquarters congratulating a party candidate 
many socialists attributed the partys gains to voter 
dissatisfaction with the liberal democrats rather than socialist 
policies 
after all this time under the ldp administration the voters 
decided they could no longer sit by and watch in silence said 
takako doi party chairwoman 
ichiro shimizu a tokyo ward politician said much of the vote 
that went to us was antildp 
the ruling partys popularity has suffered from the recuit 
influencebuying scandal which reached the highest ranks of the 
establishment and forced the resignation a month ago of prime 
minister noboru takeshita and a sex scandal afflicting his 
successor sousuke uno 
before the tokyo elections several liberal democratic leaders 
acknowledged the possibility of a loss but said they hoped to win at 
least 50 seats when the results came in party leaders said they 
had underestimated the effect of the scandals and opposition to the 
new 3 percent sales tax 
this isnt a question of right or left said asae uemura who 
won an assembly seat on the socialist ticket its an angry 
reaction from the wallets of mothers like me who must do the daily 
shopping 
she said opposition to the tax imposed april 1 was tens and 
tens times more important than the scandals 
uno is plagued by reports that he kept several paid mistresses 
he denies the reports 
he also blamed the tax for his partys defeat although the prime 
minister is party president the tokyo branch asked him to stay out 
of the municipal campaign 
representatives of several party factions including two former 
prime ministers were reported to have agreed last week that uno 
should resign for the good of the party 
about 518 million people or 587 percent of tokyos eligible 
voters cast ballots up from 535 percent in 1985 when the last 
city election was held 
thirtythree women were among the candidates this time and 17 
won

president bush has called on the 
soviet union to begin withdrawing its troops from poland asserting 
there is no danger at all of an invasion of poland from the west 
bush said he was not seeking to inflame the situation in 
poland or do anything that is going to cause a crisis 
but he said in an interview with a group of polish reporters 
very candidly id like to see soviet troops out 
bush granted the interview last friday in washington the 
transcript was released today by bushs vacation white house the 
president is enjoying an extended independence day holidy at his 
oceanside summer home 
the president said that when he visits poland next week on his 
way to the sevennation economic summit in paris im going to 
feel free to speak out aboutwhat we hold dear and what polish 
americans think and what we want to see about a freer a more whole 
europe 
it was the first time bush has called for an immediate complete 
withdrawal of soviet troops from poland last month while attending 
a nato summit in brussels the president proposed a reduction in 
conventinal forces in eastern europe to no more than 275000 each 
for nato and warsaw pact nations 
bush said in his interview with polish reporters that he still 
hoped to press forward with that very bold proposal 
at the same time he conceded it was probably unrealistic to 
envision a complete withdrawal of all soviet forces in eastern 
europe as long as we have this tremendous disparity in 
sovietdeployed troops 
but he said poland would be a good place for the soviets to 
start 
i would like to see them start withdrawing of the troops from 
poland because i think there is no danger at all of an invasion of 
poland from the west bush said and i dont think anybody in 
poland thinks theres a danger of invasion of poland from the west

the supreme court today agreed to take a fresh 
look at how far states may go to prohibit advertising by lawyers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by an illinois lawyer 
censured for saying on his professional letterhead he is a civil 
trial specialist certified by the national board of trial advocacy 
a private organization 
the court will hear arguments in the case during its next term 
beginning in october with a ruling likely in 1990 
the illinois supreme court which disciplines that states 
lawyers last february upheld the state rule against advertising 
oneself as a certified civil trial specialist 
the state court censured gary e peel of edwardsville ill who 
since 1983 included the specialist reference on his letterhead 
the state court said peels use of the reference is misleading 
because it makes it appear he is more qualified than other lawyers 
who do the same type of work the state court also rejected peels 
arguments that the rule violates his constitutional freespeech 
rights 
the state court said peels claim that he is certified as a 
civil trial specialist by the national board of trial advocacy is 
misleading because it tacitly attests to his qualifications as a 
civil trial advocate because not all attorneys licensed to practice 
law in illinois are certified by the nbta the assertion is 
tantamount to a claim of superiority by those attorneys who are 
certified 
the state court noted that only lawyers who specialize in patent 
trademark and admiralty law in illinois are allowed to advertise 
their specialties 
the reason for allowing those exceptions is to help the public 
find attorneys who practice those unusual specialties the state 
court said 
the nbta based in boston said it uses rigorous standards to 
determine whether any civil or criminal trial advocate is entitled 
to its certification 
it said it has certified more than 1000 lawyers nationwide 
the supreme court in a key 1977 ruling struck down a ban on all 
lawyer advertising ruling that it violated freespeech rights 
since then the court has upheld some regulation of lawyer ads but 
struck down other rules 
the case is peel vs attorney registration and disciplinary 
commission of illinois 881775

a team of american scientists and congressmen 
prepared monday to fly to the black sea for experiments on whether 
radiation devices can detect the presence of nuclear warheads aboard 
ships 
rep bob carr dmich described the experiment as a 
confidencebuilding measure to aid the superpowers as they 
negotiate a strategic arms reduction treaty to slash nuclear 
arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent 
four soviet navy ships will take part in the experiment 
wednesday said albert g makerov of the soviet academy of sciences 
which is sponsoring the project along with two liberal private 
american organizations the natural resource defense council and the 
federation of american scientists 
a spokeswoman for the us embassy said there would be no comment 
on the experiment because it does not involve us authorities the 
united states is aware of the project and embassy officers have 
met with the congressmen said the spokeswoman margot squire 
us navy officers have balked at allowing soviet inspectors 
aboard us warships and have objected to soviet proposals to limit 
nucleartipped cruise missiles under the proposed start agreement 
the reagan and bush administrations have maintained that 
virtually no verification regime could prevent either superpower 
from disguising shipboard nuclear warheads as conventional weapons 
thus frustrating any attempt control nuclear weapons at sea 
the soviets have cited the impasse over sealaunched cruise 
missiles as a major obstacle to completion of the strategic treaty 
makerov and physicist tom cochran who leads the us team said 
the experiment would begin wednesday at the black sea port of yalta 
the scientists will use radiation detection devices to determine 
their ability to spot nuclear weapons material aboard the soviet 
missile cruiser slava which will be carrying a nucleartipped 
cruise missile american scientists said they believed the weapon 
would be either an ssn12 or the newer ssn22 
cochran said his group would use portable devices to detect the 
emission of gamma rays given off by some forms of uranium and 
neutrons given off by plutonium 
the american team which includes physicists from stanford 
university and princeton university plans to use two types of 
detectors to be carried aboard the slava 
it was unclear how close the soviet navy would allow the american 
scientists to approach the slavas cruise missiles which are stored 
and launched from the deck 
while the american devices are in use soviet scientists will 
conduct similar tests using detectors in a helicopter and a vessel 
near the slava 
preliminary results are expected thursday although later 
calculations would be made to compare the us and soviet findings 
cochran said 
we need to take this one step at a time said cochran 
acknowledging that radiation devices alone were unlikely to provide 
adequate verification of the numbers of nuclear weapons aboard any 
naval vessel 
cochran said the tests cannot guard against efforts to evade 
any treaty by squirreling nuclear weapons in the bowels of a 
warship 
the slava will be a good test subject because there are no 
belowdecks magazines on this cruiser where other nuclear tipped 
weapons might be concealed he said 
a sister ship to the slava the marshal ustinov is due to visit 
norfolk va home of the us atlantic fleet on july 25 the port 
call is part of growing military cooperation between the united 
states and the soviet union that was reached new heights last month 
with a visit to previously closed soviet bases by the chairman of 
the us joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe 
despite growing militarytomilitary cooperation the pentagon 
opposes the yalta experiments because us officials are trying to 
get the best of both worlds the benefits of the tests without the 
responsibility carr said 
also observing the test are reps john spratt dsc and james 
olin dva

the treaty oak whose canopy has provided 
friendly shade during the dog days of summer is itself getting some 
cover by way of giant sunscreens to help save the venerable tree 
from a poisoning attack 
park employees today began erecting 65foot poles next to the 
ailing 400yearold treaty oak and later this week will hang 
40foot screens 
there is tender foliage up there it would be real easy to fry 
it said paul roberts a city environmental specialist 
leaves have turned brown and fallen off the beloved 65foot tree 
since a potent herbicide was poured at its base in what police said 
was an attempt by a 45yearold farmsupply salesman to cast a spell 
or a curse 
police on thursday charged paul stedman cullen with criminal 
mischief in the attack he could receive 20 years in prison 
roberts said the screens will reduce the sunlight hitting the 
tree by 50 percent to 60 percent were coming into a real 
stressful period for the tree we can expect upper 90s 100 degrees 
for the next two months he said 
the soil also is being replaced to a depth of about 30 inches 
and 12 sprinklers are shooting water on the tree five minutes every 
hour 
legend has it stephen f austin the father of texas made peace 
with the indians under the trees branches indians regarded the 
tree with superstitious reverence contending that tea made from its 
acorns had the power to return straying lovers or protect warriors 
the austin americanstatesman reported 
over the years couples have married or gotted engaged under the 
canopy of the tree which has a 127foot limb spread and is 525 
inches in diameter at chest height

a witness monday backed the alibi of the 
man charged with killing prime minister olof palme saying he saw 
the accused at a train station 18 miles away about the time of the 
downtown shooting 
the witness algot asell later had his credibility questioned by 
a newspaper reporter who testified asell had changed his story 
asell was the first witness in stockholm district court to 
support the alibi of defendant christer pettersson who served a 
jail sentence for manslaughter and has a long record of drug and 
alcohol abuse 
pettersson 42 has denied killing palme asell was the last 
scheduled witness in the trial which began may 29 and is to end in 
midjuly following summaries 
palme who dominated swedish politics for more than a decade was 
shot feb 28 1986 as he walked home with his wife from a late 
movie 
asell 68 said he saw pettersson waiting for a train at marsta 
station between 11 pm and 1130 pm on the night of the murder 
palme was killed at 1121 that night 
the train station is about 18 miles from the crime scene and more 
than 30 minutes by train 
newspaper reporter sakari pitkanen later cast doubt on asells 
credibility saying his testimony differed from what the witness had 
said in an interview 
pitkanen a reporter for the aftonbladet newspaper testified 
that asells account particularly on the train schedule and his 
sighting of pettersson differed from what he said in a june 
interview 
asell said he took the last train from marsta and listened to the 
midnight radio news after arriving home according to pitkanen 
he said asell changed his story after it was pointed out there 
was no midnight radio news that night 
other witnesses have testified they saw pettersson waiting for 
palme outside the movie theater and following palme down the street 
palmes wife identified pettersson as the man she saw a few feet 
away when her husband fell fatally wounded 
asell said he did not notice the exact time he saw pettersson 
but he said he bought a chocolate bar near the train station just 
before the store closed at 930 pm then went into a nearby 
restaurant until one of the last trains left the station at 11 pm 
or 1130 pm 
asell said he knew pettersson because they lived in the same 
neighborhood also monday ulf akansson who shared an apartment 
with pettersson for seven months said pettersson was an admirer of 
palme and never carried a gun

the irish republican army claimed responsibility 
monday for a bomb that killed a british soldier in west germany as 
his family watched and for a bomb attack at a belfast airport 
cpl steven smith died sunday in west germany when he opened his 
car door and a bomb exploded his wife and their four young children 
were injured hanover police said they found and defused a bomb in 
another soldiers car nearby 
three bombs exploded early monday at belfasts harbor airport 
damaging two parked airplanes and shattering windows in airport 
buildings but causing no injuries 
prime minister margaret thatcher called the bombers cowards and 
said smiths killing was doubly horrific because the family both 
were injured and saw what happened 
it just shows precisely the mentality of a terrorist mrs 
thatcher said it was another cowardly attack on people who were 
very vulnerable who do everything possible to defend us and keep 
freedom and democracy safe 
the ira which is fighting to oust britain from northern ireland 
and unite the predominantly protestant province with the roman 
catholic republic of ireland made its claims to belfast news media 
we are forced to take our struggle beyond ireland because the 
british public are restricted by their government from learning of 
its failure in ireland and the resistance to its rule it said in 
a statement 
this apparently referred to the ban imposed by the british 
government last october on broadcast interviews with members of the 
ira their supporters and other groups involved in violence in 
northern ireland 
the ira statement said smith 31 a rations officer with the 
royal tank regiment could be the last soldier to die as a result 
of the british occupation of ireland if the british government was 
to accept that after 20 years its military and political policies in 
our country have failed 
next month marks the 20th anniversary of the arrival of british 
troops in northern ireland more than 2700 people have since been 
killed 418 of them soldiers five soldiers have died in ira actions 
in west germany holland and belgium in the past 14 months 
smiths father brian said from his home in dewsbury northern 
england i never dreamed in a million years that this would happen 
to my son he has become another innocent victim the bombers who 
did this cant have a heart when they must have known children could 
have been victims 
the explosion occurred on a residential street on hanovers 
outskirts where many british military families live 
pete brown a spokesman for the british rhine army in 
moenchengladbach said smiths wife tine and their four children 
aged 2 to 11 were hospitalized in satisfactory condition 
hanover police issued composite sketches of two suspects in their 
30s whom witnesses saw nearby shortly before the attack 
three bombs exploded at belfasts harbor airport about 230 am 
eight minutes after the airport received a telephone warning police 
said 
one bomb damaged two prototype aircraft developed by shorts 
brothers ltd the other two bombs exploded near the air traffic 
control tower and on the airfield police said 
short brothers northern irelands largest employer owns harbor 
airport the secondlargest in the province after aldergrove airport

eight southern pilots begin a fourday flight to 
greenland on wednesday for an expedition aimed at reaching one of 
eight aircraft buried deep in the icecap since they crashlanded 
during world war ii 
the two b17 bombers and six p38 lightning fighters are buried 
under 265 feet of ice and snow that has accumulated since bad 
weather and low fuel forced them to abort a flight to england in 
1942 
the greenland expedition society headed by atlanta architect 
richard taylor and pat epps an aviation pioneer and owner of epps 
aviation located the planes with subsurface radar and magnetometers 
last summer 
this year they want a piece of one aircraft a b17 named big 
stoop in part to help persuade investors to finance an effort to 
bring the planes back to the united states next year 
they are estimated to be worth 5 million if repaired 
if we could get a control wheel out of a b17 it would be 
ideal taylor said but even just a piece of metal cut out of its 
skin would be tangible proof we found the aircraft 
the team plans to bore a 2inch hole to the plane with a steam 
borer and cut out a piece of metal with a coring device then bore a 
wider shaft so they can reach the plane and try to get inside 
their 3 tons of equipment ing above the clouds are insulated 
from the sights sounds and smells of rural america it has not 
always been so come along on a nostalgic trip with the jones 
family whose expeditions in the early and middle 1920s from tulsa 
okla to grandmothers house in eau claire wis were as removed 
from the present day as that day was removed from the pony express 
and covered wagons

the missing keys to the new 1925 paige sedan not only caused an 
uproar in the jones family but the whole payroll of the commercial 
hotel of nebraska city was engaged in a futile search 
my fathers famous temper climbed through the night and was not 
improved the next morning when the local locksmith confessed he was 
baffled by the trick lock on the gearshift after considerable 
shouting into feeble long distance lines an expert was summoned 
from omaha 
dick my big brother who had driven the paige into town was the 
obvious object of suspicion and outrage his usual ploy you had 
it last pointing at me wouldnt work for i was too young to 
drive the expert came installed a new lock relieved my father of 
150 and the family drove out of town a day late in a cloud of 
steam 
at dusk two days later dick and i were walking across a bridge 
at zumbrota minn dick paused and drew out of his pocket the 
original paige keys 
whered you find them 
the darned things slipped down a hole in the lining of my 
pants he said 
the keys arced prettily into the murky waters of the zumbro 
river as far as i know they are still there 
the expeditions of the jones family in the early and middle 1920s 
from tulsa okla to my grandmothers house at eau claire wis 
were as removed from the present day as that day was removed from 
the pony express and covered wagons 
prudence dictated that we go by rail but all except dad would 
spend the summer and grandmothers willis knight wouldnt be large 
enough so starting in 1921 we made touring history and tested the 
familys mutual toleration severely 
in the midwest there was no highway system federal or state 
some enthusiast had blazed what was called the omahatulsa trail 
and ots splashed crudely in green paint appeared occasionally on 
telephone poles between towns but mostly you picked your way from 
village to village by asking farmers occasionally you used the 
blue book 
a blue book in good condition should be worth its weight in 
platinum now for practically all motorists dropped them in the 
ashcans when numbered highways came as a bit of americana of the 
times they were marvelous example 
bugville mile 0 proceed north on main from elm 43 miles to 
large white house right side with red barn left to mile 91 at 
cherry creek bridge right across railroad 
the trouble with the blue book was that people repainted houses 
barns burned and the county often put in a better road a mile east 
but blue book users saw so much more because they paid attention 
city people tulsa in 1920 with pop 72000 was a city lived in 
the ambiance of the 20th century but you didnt get far out of town 
before you were back in the 19th after the sun went down the 
country grew dark except for the firefly flickers of coaloil wicks 
motels had not been invented so daring motorists stayed with the 
railroadriding drummers in town hotels generally named after the 
proprietor with the word house tacked on the end 
indoor plumbing had arrived generally one bathroom to a floor 
for the benefit of those just dropping in to lunch there was often a 
tin basin on the back stoop and you threw the soapy water on the 
grass 
fortunately i was born into the postbedbug era for by the 
early 20s country hotel sheets were changed every day but neither 
were accommodations homogenized the modern phenomenon of climatized 
rooms as alike as peas from coast to coast was far in the future 
upscale county seat hotels had menus but most others served 
family style at 6 am the board groaned with calories and 
cholesterol stewed prunes oatmeal thick cream fried eggs ham 
bacon corn fritters waffles and at 630 most of the spearing 
reaching toothpicksucking mob would dash off with their battered 
sample cases for the early trains 
there was still much individuality in hotel design and decor at 
the leading hostelry in red wing minn one entered the bedroom 
through the bathroom 
the principal hotel in atlantic iowa had once been a 
chiropractic college a fullsize skeleton lurked around the corner 
as you came upstairs no doubt filling late arrivals with amusement 
when we came exhausted and on a superheated evening to sabetha 
kan we were directed to what was described as the best hotel on 
the grand island we didnt know that the grand island railroad 
was only 100 miles long and passed through practically nothing 
that night we three children lay in our underwear crosswise on 
the bed gasping for breath there was a movie going on beneath the 
thin floor and you could sort of follow the plot with the help of 
the girl at the piano 
when she played rachmaninoffs prelude you knew the rustlers were 
sneaking up on the corral when she played the finale of william 
tells overture you could tell the posse was in full cry heavy 
banging on the bass keys told you the gun battle was joined and 
when she swung softly into hearts and flowers it said that 
wedding bells were not far off and the movie would soon be over 
getting up to grandmas wouldnt have been as exciting if only 
the parents and children had been traveling but since we were 
making a summer of it the car also contained the cat our black 
belgian shepherd blig and tony the african gray parrot 
the cat which loved comfort more than it loved the family had 
to be recaught every morning for it remembered the day before 
until the wheels moved we would stuff it in a covered basket 
the survival power of tony was amazing for dad was a furious 
driver and the car was in the air most of the time tony braced 
himself with one foot on the perch and the other clinging to the 
wire of the cage

andrei a gromyko the toughnegotiating former 
foreign minister who survived five kremlin leadership changes and 
weathered the dramatic turns of eastwest relations in a 
halfcentury of public life has died at age 79 
soviet news reports said gromkyo who oversaw soviet foreign 
policy for 28 years died sunday 
the cause of death was not announced but a foreign ministry 
spokesman said friday that gromyko had been hospitalized after 
surgery for a vascular problem heart or circulatory system that 
was not further identified 
president mikhail s gorbachev announced the death to the supreme 
soviet legislature today 
the deputies at the session with a minute of silence paid 
homage to the memory of the outstanding government and party 
leader radio moscow said 
the official tass news agency said the grimfaced gromyko was 
one of the major soviet diplomats and statesmen of the senior 
generation and added that the country lost one of its most 
prominent leaders 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said of gromyko 
he was part of our history with all its good sides and all its 
bad sides he said gromyko recently had been criticized for 
emphasizing soviet relations with the united states at the expense 
of kremlin ties with other countries 
the television news program vremya reported gromykos funeral 
will be wednesday it said he will be buried at novodevichy 
cemetery where former leader nikita s khrushchev expresident 
anastas i mikoyan and exforeign minister vyacheslav m molotov are 
interred 
gorbachev will not delay a trip to france on tuesday to attend 
the funeral gerasimov said 
president bush said he was sending condolences to gromykos son 
anatoly and us ambassador jack matlock praised gromyko as 
courteous and considerate even when relations were difficult 
as a diplomat ambassador and foreign minister gromyko helped 
forge the sovietamerican world war ii alliance joined in drafting 
the un charter and sat in on superpower talks that shaped the face 
of the modern world 
gromyko survived several purges and outlasted soviet leaders 
josef stalin khrushchev leonid i brezhnev yuri v andropov and 
konstantin u chernenko he served as soviet ambassador to the 
united states britain and the united nations which he helped found 
tass once said he took part in the most important foreign 
political developments of our time 
abba eban israelis foreign minister from 1966 to 1974 praised 
gromyko as no doubt the high priest of diplomacy he cited 
gromykos statement before the 1947 un decision on the partition 
palestine that a possibility was to divide the land into a jewish 
and arab state 
this was a pleasant surprise because the assumption was 
that the stalinist regime was antizionist and antijewish in 
principle said eban 
after gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 and revamped the 
leadership gromyko was gradually eased into retirement 
he was replaced as foreign minister that summer by eduard a 
shevardnadze a newcomer to foreign affairs and named to the then 
largely ceremonial post of president 
he stepped down from the communist partys ruling politburo sept 
30 and was replaced as president by gorbachev a day later in april 
gromyko lost his last post membership in the policymaking central 
committee 
gromyko ended his career gracefully unlike many other soviet 
officials who were abruptly stripped of posts and written out of 
official history books as new kremlin chiefs came on board 
archie brown a soviet affairs specialist at oxford university in 
britain said today that gromyko will be remembered as a fairly 
formidable figure and certainly as an operator and as a survivor 
but he added in an interview with british broadcasting corp 
gromyko was not an especially enlightened soviet leader 
gromyko generally took a backseat to the leaders he served during 
the years that the soviet union cemented its grip on eastern europe 
and rose to become a nuclear power 
indeed some observers attributed his longevity to his political 
flexibility and his apparent failure to make a bid for personal 
power 
khrushchev once said in his presence if i tell him to sit on 
an iceberg hell stay there and freeze but he wont move 
gromyko instead served as the articulator of kremlin positions to 
the world through his speeches but perhaps his most important work 
came at bargaining tables from yalta to geneva where he helped 
negotiate everything from allied war strategy to the salt nuclear 
weapons treaties 
gromyko gained a reputation as mr nyet for his tough 
negotiating style he was nicknamed grim grom for his stony 
countenance 
his craggy face beneath hornrimmed glasses became instantly 
recognizable to the outside world 
andrei andreyevich gromyko was born july 18 1909 to 
byelorussian peasants 
joining the communist party in 1931 he first studied economics 
but switched to a foreign ministry whose ranks were depleted by 
stalins purges 
at 39 gromyko was the youngest ambassador in soviet history but 
he proved his expertise by helping put together the alliance against 
nazi germany 
his career took him to tehran potsdam and yalta where one story 
says winston churchill threw cigar stubs at him after he repeatedly 
whispered into stalins ear that he should demand germanys 
unconditional surrender 
rising through the ranks of the foreign service gromyko served 
as ambassador to britain in 195253 
khrushchev appointed gromyko foreign minister in 1957 and he 
helped the kremlin leaders turn the soviet union into americas 
equal as a world power 
two days before the cuban missile crisis broke out in october 
1962 gromyko calmly told president john f kennedy there were no 
soviet missiles in cuba 
while he presented his poker face to the world many of those who 
knew gromyko said his stoic features masked a sharp wit 
among the anecdotes that became favorites with journalists was 
his reply when asked if he had enjoyed breakfast one day 
perhaps gromyko said 
gromyko and his wife lydia dmitriyevna had a son anatoly who 
has directed the african institute of the soviet academy of 
sciences they also had a daughter emilia and several 
grandchildren 
the private lives of soviet leaders are shrouded in secrecy and 
it was not immediately known which relatives survived

iran on monday marked the first 
anniversary of the us downing of a civilian jetliner with a 
memorial service at the airport where the flight originated and it 
demanded full compensation for the victims 
the july 3 1988 shootdown by the uss vincennes in which 290 
people were killed was a crime that showed the great satan 
the united states exercised state terrorism irans foreign 
ministry said 
at a memorial ceremony at the airport in bandar abbas the 
director of civil aviation announced the airport had been renamed 
the international airport of the tir 12 martyrs tehran radio 
reported according to the lunar persian calendar last years date 
of tir 12 coincided with july 3 1988 
iran air flight 655 had left the city of bandar abbas en route to 
dubai in the united arab emirates when the uss vincennes in the 
persian gulf picked it up on radar and mistook it for an iranian jet 
fighter 
the sailors who had been involved in a skirmish with iranian 
gunboats earlier that day opened fire downing the a300 airbus and 
killing all 290 people aboard most of the victims were iranians 
at the airport ceremony civil aviation director mohammad nabi 
habibi unveiled a painting depicting the incident and displayed 
several parts of the aircraft pulled from the gulf said the 
broadcast monitored in nicosia 
the martyrs of this incident were another group of innocent 
people who fell victims of american atrocities it quoted him as 
saying 
relatives of the victims clergymen and air force and civil 
aviation officials attended the ceremony tehran radio said 
the foreign ministry demanded full compensation for all victims 
but it did not mention a figure washington has indicated it is 
ready to pay compensation but it wants to be sure none of the money 
goes to the iranian government 
the iranian daily newspaper jomhuri islami urged other countries 
to counter us brutalities 
the daily abrar said an editorial the iranian nation will 
never forget us crimes 
this has kindled a fire in the heart of the iranian nation 
which would not be extinguished without the elimination of us 
criminals it said 
the englishlanguage kayhan international said the incident 
proved that tehrans relations with washington are irreparable 
those who feel the situation may change in the near future are 
advised to go through the pictures of mutilated bodies of iranians

manufacturers of the ships radar system a spokesman for the group 
said sunday in abu dhabi 
nagib ghafoor spokesman for the flight 655 litigation group 
said the suit was filed june 28 in us district court in san 
francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 victims 
pentagon analysts have said splitsecond decisions aboard the 
vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to match 
the planes radar trace with digital direction altitude and speed 
information displayed on another screen 
ghafoor said the suit named the general electric co and other 
entities which designed and manufactured the radar equipment on 
board the uss vincennes

norma mccorvey the jane roe whose case 
led to the 1973 us supreme court ruling legalizing abortion said 
she took todays court decision allowing states to restrict abortion 
very personally 
it saddens my heart very deeply to know that poor women are 
once again going to be out there going to backstreet abortions and 
possibly be mutilated and not have the right to choose she said 
in appearance on the cable news network show sonya live in la 
mccorvey a housekeeper in dallas said she was disappointed by 
todays decision but i am however somewhat grateful they are 
not reversing roe vs wade at this point i do realize at another 
point they will be chipping away from it 
in its 54 decision today the high court gave states new 
authority to limit a womans right to an abortion including 
authority to ban use of public facilities for abortions 
but the court stopped short of reversing its 1973 roe vs wade 
ruling which said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
the landmark decision resulted from a lawsuit filed by mccorvey 
under the pseudonym jane roe in 1969 mccorvey unmarried 
unemployed and pregnant went to her family doctor and asked for an 
abortion which was illegal in texas her doctor refused and she 
didnt like what she saw at an illegal abortion clinic spurring the 
lawsuit 
mccorvey said today that during her first pregnancy i wasnt 
financially able to go to new york or any other state where

leading hungary for 32 years senior communist leaders said he was 
gravely ill but they did not specify the ailment 
in may 1988 kadar was named honorary chairman of the ruling 
hungarian socialist workers party which he had led since kremlin 
troops and tanks crushed an antisoviet revolt in 1956 
under karoly grosz who succeeded kadar as party general 
secretary but has himself been forced to share power with three 
prominent party reformers kadars political legacy increasingly has

it was a hitormiss affair until dianne reeves 
came on stage then the promise that had been a 50th anniversary 
concert for the blue note record label became reality 
miss reeves mature talent and elegant presence redeemed the 
concert which amply illustrated the pitfalls such amalgam 
programming invites 
the friday night event at carnegie hall part of the jvc jazz 
festival began auspiciously with brazilian pianist eliane elias 
playing some driving music with a fivepiece band she then changed 
pace warming the audience with a lyrical solo piece 
the tony williams quintet succeeded the brazilian sound with its 
own highintensity brand of jazz the quintet led by drummer tony 
williams went its own way it failed to build on the mood 
after the intermission electrical guitarist stanley jordan 
played a long rambling selfindulgent set although a trio was 
listed on the program to back him up they failed to appear on 
stage it wasnt clear whether his solos had used up his time 
allotment or whether he had just forgotten about his fellow 
musicians 
just when it appeared the evening might be a musical failure 
miss reeves appeared 
she sang some standards my funny valentinethe nearness 
of youhow high the moon and gave them her own signature 
she sang a slaves field song and some blues 
throughout her performance her wit and warmth charmed the 
audience 
shortly after she came on stage she confided that it was her 
carnegie hall debut by the end of her segment the crowd was 
willing to give her the deed to the place

this appeal concerns the constitutionality of a missouri statute 
regulating the performance of abortions the united states court of 
appeals for the eight circuit struck down several provisions of the 
statute on the ground that they violated this courts decision in 
roe v wade 410 us 113 1973 and cases following it we noted 
probable jurisdiction and now reverse 
in june 1986 the governor of missouri signed into law missouri 
senate committee substitute for house bill no 1596 hereinafter act 
or statute which amended existing state law concerning unborn 
children and abortions 
the act consisted of 20 provisions 5 of which are now before the 
court the first provision or preamble contains findings by 
the state legislature that the life of each human being begins at 
conception and that unborn children have protectable interests 
in life health and wellbeing the act further requires that all 
missouri laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the 
same rights enjoyed by other persons subject to the federal 
constitution and this courts precedents among its other 
provisions the act requires that prior to performing an abortion 
on any woman whom a physician has reason to believe is 20 or more 
weeks pregnant the physician ascertain whether the fetus is viable 
by performing such medical examinations and tests as are necessary 
to make a finding of the gestational age weight and lung maturity 
of the unborn child the act also prohibits the use of public 
employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not 
necessary to save the mothers life and it prohibits the use of 
public funds employees or facilities for the purpose of 
encouraging or counseling a woman to have an abortion not 
necessary to save her life 
decision of this case requires us to address four sections of the 
missouri act a the preamble b the prohibition on the use of 
public facilities or employees to perform abortions c the 
prohibition on public funding of abortion counseling and d the 
requirement that physicians conduct viability tests prior to 
performing abortions 
the acts preamble as noted sets forth findings by the 
missouri legislature that the life of each human being begins at 
conception and that unborn children have protectable interests 
in life health and wellbeing the act then mandates that state 
laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with all the 
rights privileges and immunities available to other persons 
citizens and residents of this state subject to the constitution 
and this courts precedents in invalidating the preamble the court 
of appeals relied on this courts dictum that a state may not 
adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of 
abortions it rejected missouris claim that the preamble was 
abortionneutral and merely determined when life begins in a 
nonabortion context a traditional state prerogative 
in our view the court of appeals misconceived the meaning 
which was only that a state could not justify an abortion 
regulation otherwise invalid under roe v wade on the ground that it 
embodied the states view about when life begins 
it will be time enough for federal courts to address the meaning 
of the preamble should it be applied to restrict the activities of 
appellees in some concrete way until then this court is not 
empowered to decide abstract propositions or to declare for 
the government of future cases principles or rules of law which 
cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue before it we 
therefore need not pass on the constitutionality of the acts

section 188210 provides that it shall be unlawful for any 
public employee within the scope of his employment to perform or 
assist an abortion not necessary to save the life of the mother 
while 188215 makes it unlawful for any public facility to be used 
for the purpose of performing or assisting an abortion not necessary 
to save the life of the mother the court of appeals held that 
these provisions contravened this courts abortion decisions we 
take the contrary view 
the appeals court reasoned that the ban on the use of public 
facilities could prevent a womans chosen doctor from performing 
an abortion because of his unprivileged status at other hospitals or 
because a private hospital adopted a similar antiabortion stance 
it also thought that such a rule could increase the cost of 
obtaining an abortion and delay the timing of it as well 
we think that this analysis is much like that which we rejected 
in four other cases as in those cases the states decision here 
to use public facilities and staff to encourage childbirth over 
abortion places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman 
who chooses to terminate her pregnancy 
missouris refusal to allow public employees to perform abortions 
in public hospitals leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as 
if the state had chosen not to operate any public hospitals at all 
the challenged provisions only restrict a womans ability to obtain 
an abortion to the extent that she chooses to use a physician 
affiliated with a public hospital this circumstance is more easily 
remedied and thus considerably less burdensome than indigency which 
may make it difficult and in some cases perhaps impossible 
for some women to have abortions without public funding having 
held that the states refusal to fund abortions does not violate roe 
v wade it strains logic to reach a contrary result for the use of 
public facilities and employees 
three previous cases all support the view that the state need 
not commit any resources to facilitating abortions even if it can 
turn a profit by doing so thus we uphold the acts restrictions 
on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or 
assistance of nontherapeutic abortions

the missouri act contains three provisions relating to 
encouraging or counseling a woman to have an abortion not 
necessary to save her life section 118205 states that no public 
funds can be used for this purpose 188210 states that public 
employees cannot within the scope of their employment engage in 
such speech and 188215 forbids such speech in public facilities 
the court of appeals held that all three of these provisions 
were unconstitutionally vague and that the ban on using public 
funds employees and facilities to encourage or counsel a woman to 
have an abortion is an unacceptable infringement of the womans 14th 
amendment right to choose an abortion after receiving the medical 
information necessary to exercise the right knowingly and 
intelligently 
missouri has chosen only to appeal the court of appeals 
invalidation of the public funding provision a majority of the 
court agrees with appellees that the controversy is now moot 
we accordingly direct the court of appeals to vacate the judgment of 
the district court with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of 
the complaint 
section 188029 of the missouri act provides 
before a physician performs an abortion on a woman he has 
reason to believe is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeks 
gestational age the physician shall first determine if the unborn 
child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care skill 
and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinarily skillful 
careful and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under the 
same or or similar conditions in making this determination of 
viability the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such 
medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of 
the gestational age weight and lung maturity of the unborn child 
and shall enter such findings and determination of viability in the 
medical record of the mother 
as with the preamble the parties disagree over the meaning of 
this statutory provision 
the court of appeals read 188029 as requiring that after 20 
weeks doctors must perform tests to find gestational age fetal 
weight and lung maturity the court indicated that the tests 
needed to determine fetal weight at 20 weeks are unreliable and 
inaccurate and would add 125 to 250 to the cost of an abortion 
 
we must first determine the meaning of 188029 under missouri 
law our usual practice is to defer to the lower courts 
construction of a state statute but we believe the court of appeals 
has fallen into plain error in this case 
we think the viabilitytesting provision makes sense only if the 
second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful 
in making subsidiary findings as to viability 
the viabilitytesting provision of the missouri act is concerned 
with promoting the states interest in potential human life rather 
than in maternal health 
in roe v wade the court recognized that the state has 
important and legitimate interests in protecting maternal health 
and in the potentiality of human life during the second trimester 
the state may if it chooses regulate the abortion procedure in 
ways that are reasonably related to maternal health 
in the first place the rigid roe framework is hardly consistent 
with the notion of a constitution case in general terms as ours is 
and usually speaking in general principles as ours does the key 
elements of the roe framework trimesters and viability are not 
found in the text of the constitution or in any place else one would 
expect to find a constititional principle 
in the second place we do not see why the states interest in 
protecting potential human life should come into existence only at 
the point of viability and that there should therefore be a rigid 
line allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting it 
before viability 
the tests that 188029 requires the physician to perform are 
designed to determine viability we are satisfied that the 
requirement of these tests permissibly furthers the states 
interests in protecting human life and we therefore believe 188029 
to be constitutional 
the dissent takes us to task for our failure to join in a great 
issues debate as to whether the constitutional includes an 
unenumerated general right to privacy

the dissent also accuses us of cowardice and illegitimacy in 
dealing with the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of 
our time there is no doubt that our holding today will allow some 
governmental regulation of abortion that would have been prohibited 
under the language of other cases 
the dissents suggestion that legislative bodies in a nation 
where more than half of our population is women will treat our 
decision today as an invitation to enact abortion regulation 
reminiscent of the dark ages not only misreads our views but does 
scant justice to those who serve in such bodies and the people who 
elect them 
both appellants and the united states have urged that we overrule 
our decision in roe v wade the facts of the present case however 
differ from those at issue in roe here missouri has determined 
that viability is the point at which its interest in potential human 
life must be safeguarded in roe on the other hand the texas 
statute criminalized the performance of all abortions except when 
the mothers life was at stake this case therefore affords us no 
occasion to revisit the holding of roe which was that the texas 
statute unconstitutionally infringed the right to an abortion 
derived from the due process clause and we leave it undisturbed to 
the extent indicated in our opinion we would modify and narrow roe 
and succeeding cases 
because none of the challenged provisions of the missouri act 
properly before us conflict with the constitution the judgment of 
the court of appeals is reversed

excerpts from justice sandra day oconnor concurring in part and 
concurring in the judgment 
nothing in the record before us or the opinions below indicates 
that subsections 1 1 and 1 2 of the preamble to missouris 
abortion regulation statute will affect a womans decision to have 
an abortion justice stevens suggests that the preamble may also 
interfere with contraceptive choices because certain 
contraceptive devices act on a female ovum after it has been 
fertilized by a male sperm 
the missouri act defines conception as the fertilization of 
the ovum of a female by the sperm of a male and invests unborn 
children with protectable interests in life health and 
wellbeing from the moment of conception 
justice stevens asserts that any possible interference with a 
womans right to use such postfertilization contraceptive devices 
would be unconstitutional under griswold vs connecticut and our 
subsequent contraception cases 
similarly certain amici suggest that the missouri acts preamble 
may prohibit the developing technology of invitro fertilization a 
technique used to aid couples otherwise unable to bear children in 
which a number of ova are removed from the woman and fertilized by 
male sperm this process often produces excess fertilized ova 
unborn children under the missouri acts definition that are 
discarded rather than reinserted into the womans uterus 
it may be correct that the use of postfertilization contraceptive 
devices is constitutionally protected by griswold and its progeny 
but as with a womans abortion decision nothing in the record of 
the opinions below indicates that the preamble will affect a womans 
decision to practice contraception neither is there any 
indication of the possibility that the preamble might be applied to 
prohibit the performance of invitro fertilization i agree with the 
court therefore that all of these intimations of 
unconstitutionality are simply too hypothethical to support the use 
of declaratory judgment procedures and injunctive remedies in this 
case 
similarly it seems to me to follow directly from our previous 
decisions concerning state or federal funding of abortions that 
appellees facial challenge to the constitutionality of missouris 
ban on the utilization of public facilities and the participation of 
public employees in the performance of abortions not necessary to 
save the life of the mother cannot succeed

in its interpretation of missouris determination of 
viability provision the plurality has proceeded in a manner 
unnecessary to deciding the question at hand i agree with the 
plurality that it was plain error for the court of appeals to 
interpret the second sentence of the missouri statute as 
meaning that doctors must perform tests to find gestational age 
fetal weight and lung maturity 
unlike the plurality i do not understand these viability testing 
requirements to conflict with any of the courts past decisions 
concerning state regulation of abortion 
it is clear to me that requiring the performance of examinations 
and tests useful to determining whether a fetus is viable when 
viability is possible and when it would not be medically imprudent 
to do so does not impose an undue burden on a womans abortion 
decision 
accordingly because the court of appeals misinterpreted the 
missouri statute and because properly interpreted the 
statute is not inconsistent with any of this courts prior 
precedents i would reverse the decision of the court of appeals

justice marshall join concurring in part and dissenting in part 
today roe vs wade 410 us 113 1973 and the fundamental 
constitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate a 
pregnancy survive but are not secure although the court 
extricates itself from this case without making a single even 
incremental change in the law of abortion the plurality and justice 
scalia would overrule roe and would return to the states 
virtually unfettered authority to control the quintessentially 
intimate personal and lifedirecting decision whether to carry a 
fetus to term 
although today no less than yesterday the constitution and the 
decisions of this court prohibit a state from enacting laws that 
inhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right a 
plurality of this court implicitly invites every state legislature 
to enact more and more restrictive abortion regulations in order to 
provoke more and more test cases in the hope that sometime down the 
line the court will return the law of procreative freedom to the 
severe limitations that generally prevailed in this country before 
jan 22 1973 
never in my memory has a plurality announced a judgment of this 
court that so foments disregard for the law and for our standing 
decisions 
nor in my memory has a plurality gone about its business in 
such a deceptive fashion at every level of its review from its 
effort to read the real meaning out of the missouri statute to its 
intended evisceration of precedents and its deafening silence about 
the constitutional protections that it would jettison the plurality 
obscures the portent of its analysis 
with feigned restraint the plurality announces that its analysis 
leaves roe undisturbed albeit modified and narrowed but 
this disclaimer is totally meaningless the plurality opinion is 
filled with winks and nods and knowing glances to those who would 
do away with roe explicitly but turns a stone face to anyone in 
search of what the plurality conceives as the scope of a womans 
right under the due process clause to terminate a pregnancy free 
from the coercive and brooding influence of the state 
the simple truth is that roe would not survive the pluralitys 
analysis and that the plurality provides no substitute for roes 
protective umbrella i fear for the future i fear for the liberty 
and equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of age 
in the 16 years since roe was decided i fear for the integrity of 
and public esteem for this court

excerpts from justice stevens concurring in part and dissenting 
in part 
the reasons why i would also affirm the court of appeals of the 
viability testing provision and of the preamble require separate 
explanation 
it seems to me that the plurality strains to place a 
construction on 188029 that enables it to conclude we would 
modify and narrow roe and succeeding cases that statement is 
illadvised because there is no need to modify even slightly the 
holdings of prior cases in order to uphold 188029 
my interpretation of the plain language is supported by the 
structure of the statute as a whole particularly the preamble 
which finds that life begins at conception and further 
commands that state laws shall be construed to provide the maximum 
protection to the unborn child at every stage of development 
thus it is not incongruous to assume that the missouri 
legislature was trying to protect the potential human life of 
nonviable fetuses by making the abortion decision more costly i 
am also satisfied for the reasons stated by justice blackmun that 
the testing provision is manifestly unconstitutional 
to the extent that the missouri statute interferes with 
contraceptive choices i have no doubt that it is unconstitutional 
under the courts holdings in three previous cases 
indeed i am persuaded that the absence of any secular purpose 
for the legislative declarations that life begins at conception and 
that conception occurs at fertilization makes the relevant portion 
of the preamble invalid under the establishment clause of the first 
amendment to the federal constitition this conclusion does not and 
could not rest on the fact that the statement happens to coincide 
with the tenets of certain relgions or on the fact that the 
legislators who voted to enact it may have been motivated by 
religious considerations rather it rests on the fact that the 
preamble an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet of some 
but by no means all christian faiths serves no identifiable secular 
purpose that fact alone compels a conclusion that the statute 
violates the establishment clause 
the preamble to the missouri statute endorses the theological 
position that there is the same secular interest in preserving the 
life of a fetus during the first 40 to 80 days of pregnancy as there 
is after viability indeed after the time when the fetus has 
become a person with legal rights protected by the constitution 
 
as a secular matter there is an obvious difference between the 
state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the 
state interest in protecting a 9monthgestated fully sentient 
fetus on the eve of birth there can be no interest in protecting 
the newly fertilized egg from physical pain or mental anguish 
because the capacity for such suffering does not yet exist 
respecting a developed fetus however that interest is valid 
the states suggestion that the finding in the preamble to 
its abortion statute is in effect an amendment to its tort 
property and criminal laws is not persuasive 
bolstering my conclusion that the preamble violates the first 
amendment is the fact that the intensely divisive character of much 
of the national debate over the abortion issue reflects the deeply 
held religious convictions of many participants in the debate the 
missouri legislature may not inject its endorsement of a particular 
religious tradition into this debate for the establishment clause 
does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement 
in my opinion the preamble to the missouri statute is 
unconstitutional for two reasons to the extent that it has 
substantive impact on the freedom to use contraceptive procedures 
it is inconsistent with the central holding in griswold a previous 
case to the extent that it merely makes legislative findings 
without operative effect as the state argues it violates the 
establishment clause of the first amendment contrary to the 
theological finding of the missouri legislature a womans 
constitutionally protected liberty encompasses the right to act on 
her own belief that to paraphrase st thomas aquinas until a 
seed has acquired the powers of sensation and movement the life of 
a human being has not yet begun

excerpts from justice scalia concurring in part and concurring 
in judgment 
i share justice blackmuns view that it effectively would 
overrule roe vs wade 410 us 113 1973 i think that should be 
done but would do it more explicitly 
the outcome of todays case will doubtless be heralded as a 
triumph of judicial statesmanship it is not that unless it is 
statesmanlike needlessly to prolong this courts selfawarded 
sovereignty over a field where it has little proper business since 
the answers to most of the cruel questions posed are political not 
juridical a sovereignty which therefore quite properly but to the 
great damage of the court makes it the object of the sort of 
organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy 
ought to receive 
justice oconnors assertion that a fundamental mental rule 
of judicial restraint requires us to avoid reconsidering roe 
cannot be taken seriously by finessing roe we do not as she 
suggests adhere to the strict and venerable rule that we should 
avoid deciding questions of a constitutional nature 
we have not disposed of this case on some statutory or procedural 
ground but have decided and could not avoid deciding whether 
the missouri statute meets the requirements of the united states 
constitution 
the real question then is whether there are valid reasons to go 
beyond the most stingy possible holding today it seems to me there 
are not only valid but compelling ones 
ordinarily speaking no more broadly than is absolutely required 
avoids throwing settled law into confusion doing so today preserves 
a chaos that is evident to anyone who can read and count 
alone sufficient to justify a broad holding is the fact that our 
retaining control through roe of what i believe to be and many of 
our citizens recognize to be a political issue continuously 
distorts the public perception of the role of this court 
we can now look forward to at least another term with carts full 
of mail from the public and streets full of demonstrators urging us 
their unelected and lifetenured judges who have been awarded 
those extraordinary undemocratic characteristics precisely in order 
that we might follow the law despite the popular will to follow the 
popular will 
indeed i expect we can look forward to even more of that than 
before given our indecisive decision today and if these reasons 
for taking the unexceptional course of reaching a broader holding 
are not enough then consider the nature of the constitutional 
question we avoid in most cases we do no harm by speaking more 
broadly than the decision requires anyone affected by the conduct 
that the avoided holding would have prohibited will be able to 
challenge it himself and have his day in court to make the argument 
not so with respect to the harm that many states believed 
preroe and many may continue to believe is caused by largely 
unrestricted abortion that will continue to occur if the states 
have the constitutional power to prohibit it and would do so but 
we skillfully avoid telling them so perhaps those abortions cannot 
constitutionally be proscribed that is surely an arguable question 
the question that reconsideration of roe vs wade entails 
but what is not at all arguable it seems to me is that we 
should decide now and not insist that we be run into a corner before 
we grudgingly yield up our judgment the only reason for the latter 
course is to prevent a change in the law but to think that 
desirable begs the question to be decided 
on the question of constitutionality of the missouri statute 
i concur in the judgment of the court and strongly dissent from 
the manner in which it has been reached

voters began registering monday to vote 
in independence elections for namibia the strategic territory south 
africa has used as a buffer against blackruled states 
registration offices throughout the territory saw a steady stream 
of voters monday said eberhard hoffmann a spokesman for namibias 
south african administrator 
mobile units will begin moving into rural areas tuesday he said 
except for a few minor hitches the program has started 
smoothly hoffmann said refusing to describe the problems 
there is no official figure for how many people are eligible to 
vote in the unsupervised elections estimates put the number at 
400000 to 650000 tens of thousands of refugees still are expected 
to be airlifted home before registration ends on sept 15 
they will vote in november for legislators who will draw up a 
constitution for the new country expected to become independent 
early next year 
supporters of the guerrillabacked southwest africa peoples 
organization widely expected to win most assembly seats are 
unhappy with some registration provisions particularly one allowing 
anyone who has lived in the territory for four years to register to 
vote 
they say it may permit an estimated 30000 angolans refugees to 
vote and also would include south african soldiers police and 
civil servants the registration law requires anyone qualifying 
under the residency rule to promise they intend to stay in namibia 
after the elections but it is not enforceable 
also eligible is anyone over 18 who was born in the territory or 
is the natural child of parents born there 
the figures are significant as namibia has a population of only 
13 million in a vast semidesert covering an area the size of texas 
and louisiana 
south africa which has ruled namibia since 1915 agreed to grant 
independence under a peace plan signed in december with cuba and 
angola the accord calls for cuba to withdraw its 50000 soldiers 
from angola and south africa to stop supporting usbacked rebels 
fighting angolas marxist government angolas government and rebels 
declared a ceasefire june 22

the us embassy filed a protest with the chinese 
government monday alleging soldiers deliberately fired semiautomatic 
rifles into american diplomats apartments last month china denied 
the charge 
eleven apartments in a diplomatic compound were struck by bullets 
june 7 according to a us embassy report obtained by the 
associated press 
there is no doubt that certain apartments were deliberately 
targeted by the pla peoples liberation army said the report 
no one was injured in the compound the report said two american 
children in one of the apartments were shielded by their chinese 
nursemaids 
one apartment was hit with 18 bullets and another was examined 
and found to have been hit by several rounds fired from across the 
street and not on the ground below as the chinese have claimed 
according to the report 
embassy charge daffaires raymond burghardt delivered a note of 
protest to the chinese foreign ministry but there was no immediate 
response said embassy spokesman sheridan bell 
the governmentrun xinhua news agency said the allegations were a 
lie and that the soldiers were firing in selfdefense after snipers 
began firing at them from both sides of the street 
under such circumstance they certainly have the right to fire 
in selfdefense at the direction from where the snipers shots 
came xinhua said it said one soldier died and two were wounded 
the attack came a day after the state department announced that 
chinas leading dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi had taken 
refuge in the us embassy after the military crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators american diplomats would not link that 
to the shooting 
the studentled prodemocracy movement was crushed june 34 when 
the army and police moved into central beijings tiananmen square 
and drove out students and their supporters 
chinese reports say about 300 people died in the violence 
including many soldiers and police officers chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence reports say the death toll could be as high as 
3000 mostly civilians 
more than 1900 people have been reported arrested since then 
and 27 people have been executed but some of the student protest 
leaders have avoided capture 
a reporter from taiwan who said he interviewed one of the wanted 
students was missing after reportedly being forced into a car early 
monday by undercover police 
huang tehpei who works for the taiwan independence morning 
post said he interviewed student leader wang dan who is on a 
nationwide wanted list on sunday 
police would not confirm huang was detained but antonio jiang a 
reporter for taiwans journalist weekly said he feared huang and 
wang had been arrested 
huang met wang in beijing on sunday and was driving with him in a 
car when they noticed they were being followed jiang said huang 
got out of the car and wang was driven off by the cars driver but 
the driver has not been seen since jiang said 
he said huangs room was searched early monday and he was forced 
into a car with no license plates outside his hotel around noon 
wang 20 is among the most wanted people in china a history 
major at beijing university he was among 21 students named in 
allpoints bulletins as organizers of the sevenweek democracy 
protests 
wang said he had been in hiding in southern china and recently 
returned to beijing according to jiang it would have been highly 
unusual for wang to come to beijing where there is an intense 
police dragnet unless he was desperate for help to leave the 
country 
while public reports of arrests have reduced to a trickle they 
are known to be continuing 
two men in handcuffs were led across a street by soldiers monday 
night and residents report many people have been taken away 
questioned and sometimes beaten before being released without being 
charged 
china protested monday to the french government over a june 29 
incident in which demonstrators occupied part of the chinese embassy 
in paris for more than two hours 
chinese media said the french demonstrators forced their way into 
the embassys education section and hung banners attacking and 
vilifying china french news reports said about 30 people took 
part in the protest neither they nor xinhua said what the protest 
was about 
a senior foreign ministry official told the french ambassadr in 
beijing that china demanded the french government punish the 
culprits and take practical and effective measures to ensure that no 
similar incident would occur in future xinhua reported 
premier li peng who ordered martial law in beijing on may 20 
submitted a draft bill monday prohibiting protests that impinge 
upon the interests of the state 
it said no protests may oppose the leadership of the communist 
party or socialist system advocate the splitting of china or take 
place near important facilities such as government or party offices 
airports train stations state guesthouses or diplomatic missions

when the supreme courts decision on abortion 
finally came it brought momentary silence to the waiting crowd on 
the sun drenched plaza outside 
then the two sides prolife prochoice began screaming 
at each other once again 
but first lawyers in dark suits stood on the whitemarble paving 
stones hurriedly flipping through the 78 pages of the courts 
decision in william webster attorney general of missouri et al vs 
reproductive health services et al 
as it became clear that the court had strengthened the power of 
the states to limit abortion though stopping short of overturning 
the landmark roe vs wade decision a young man in the crowd held up 
a prepared sign 
thank you supreme court it read 
too bad you guys lost a grinning teenager gloated as he 
passed a group of abortionrights demonstrators their banner 
drooping 
not the courts not the states women will ddecide our fate 
prochoice demonstrators shouted 
a bearded man in the brown robes of a monk knelt facing the 
court praying aloud 
he was flanked by nine men and women most holding antiabortion 
placards 
a young man tossed a dozen paperwrapped coat hangers the symbol 
of unsafe abortions on the marble steps in front of the group 
the praying man reached into his robes removed a bottle of 
water and sprinkled the coat hangers 
volunteers picked up them up and hauled them away 
coat hangers were tossed down removed replaced and soon the 
steps leading to the plaza of the court were carpeted with coat 
hangers hundreds of them most of them lettered in red never 
again 
leaders of the fight for or against abortion trooped to clusters 
of waiting microphones to hail the courts decision or to mourn it 
scores of spectators lined the rims of nearby marble fountains 
straining to hear 
it is very clear the prolife cause is galvanized said tom 
glessner executive director of the christian action council it 
was a major victory for the prolife movement 
i think its a serious setback said bella abzug the former 
democratic congresswoman from new york i think women should 
mobilize all over the country and make it clear that the people are 
supreme not the court this is a creeping invasion of womens 
rights thhats what it is a creeping invasion 
molly yard president of the national organization for women was 
asked what impact the decision will have 
it means that if youve got money you can get an abortion 
she replied if youre poor youre down the drain 
inside the court more than a hundred people waited in a basement 
corridor to obtain copies of the decision 
near them carved in gilt letters on white marble were words 
from an 1821 decision of the court a constitution is formed for 
ages to come the course cannot always be tranquil 
outside on the plaza there was no tranquility 
two men shouted opposing slogans at each other amplifying their 
screams with bull horns 
groups of shouters appeared here and there becoming more 
animated and shrill with the approach of television cameras 
a redfaced young man to a darkhaired woman is that what 
youre saying because im a man youre not going to listen to my 
argument 
its murder thats what it is murder a man shouted at 
another group 
its not yet a person came the shouted reply 
yes it is its a baby its a life 
over their heads the repeated chant could be heard not the 
courts not the states women will decide our fate 
and the reply we will we will we will rescue babies 
the supreme court of the united states had ruled 
but the socially divisive battle over abortion rights was clearly 
not over

called him and told him he was going to commit suicide nadolny said 
the man had just learned he had cancer and did not have enough money 
to fight to the disease 
i told him i wanted to talk to him i told him i would give him

needed a lot of help nadolny said 
although nadolny was able to help prevent that suicide two other 
young men in the naugatuck area shot themselves in june both had

sudans new military leader promises an end 
to a ruinous civil war and better living standards for some of the 
worlds poorest people 
but lt gen omar hassan ahmed bashirs announcements are short 
on details and some experts fear they may prove to be window 
dressing to adorn another authoritarian military regime in khartoum 
shortly after bashir overthrew prime minister sadek mahdis 
civilian government friday the littleknown paratroop brigadier 
imposed a state of emergency he disbanded the countrys 36 
political parties banned independent newspapers and slammed an 
indefinite nighttime curfew on the capital 
coup leaders declared themselves a 15member command council of 
the national salvation revolution chaired by bashir he quickly 
skipped a rank to become a threestar general and appointed himself 
prime minister defense minister and military commander in chief 
bashir then went about consolidating power in the classic way he 
retired 28 of his military superiors and promised speedy trials for 
politicians and officials he accused of stealing public funds and 
destroying the economy soldiers arrested 20 or so senior 
politicians but mahdi himself remains at large 
any coup has to start out like this said peter woodward a 
sudan expert lecturing at britains reading university 
it could be the basis of authoritarianism when information 
becomes clear on exactly how many people they have arrested the way 
they are treating them whether they will reopen educational 
institutions that will show the degree of authoritarianism he 
said monday in a telephone interview 
the june revolution is the fourth military coup in sudans 33 
years of independence from britain generals have ruled all but 10 
years 
it looks like this leader has all the characteristics of the 
military regimes in the 50s and 60s said tim niblock director 
of middle eastern politics at britains exeter university 
its not just that he has taken all these measures niblock 
said he seems to be saying that political parties are a waste of 
time and bound to be corrupt its difficult to see him loosening 
these controls anytime soon 
woodward agreed he said the civilian government bashir has 
promised to appoint on an unspecified date could turn into a group 
of civil servant puppets with the junta pulling the strings 
yet sudans military once before has kept such a promise the 
junta that overthrow military dictator gaafar nimeiri in april 1985 
pledged to restore civilian government in a year they surprised 
observers by overseeing fair multiparty elections that brought mahdi 
to power in april 1986 
woodward said he is not surprised bashir suspended moves to end 
the civil war canceling a new round of talks with the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army that was to begin tuesday in the ethiopian 
capital addis ababa mahdi initiated the new initiative under 
pressure from the military and trade unions 
woodward said the new leadership is bound to take stock of the 
governments position in the bloody costly sixyear conflict before 
returning to the bargaining table which bashir has promised to do 
the war against the minority animists and christians of the 
south cost the government a ruinous 1 million a day and caused 
widespread famine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives 
bashir is from the dominant northern arabs who are moslem 
exeters niblock said the new leadership is making the right 
noises about ending the war and emphasizing mahdis failure to 
deal with the fighting and the economy as reasons for the coup 
but he stressed bashirs coup faces the same problems as other 
military takeovers in africa and the middle east 
the new leadership makes a hit with the media niblock said 
then the regime loses impetus problems build up and the military 
is not equipped to deal with them it has no political experience 
sudans 22 million people complained mahdis indecisiveness 
crippled his ability to end the war or improve the economy mahdis 
government was buffeted by street demonstrations protesting high 
prices and severe shortages of basic goods 
when bashir broadcast news of the coup friday morning over 
official radio omdurman there were no obvious signs of opposition 
or happiness 
its difficult to try and secondguess them woodward said of 
the juntas plans maybe they havent thought it out themselves

through eight election campaigns abortion has 
stirred bitterness and venom into american politics and the 
supreme courts decision monday points to even angrier contention 
state by state by state 
by allowing states to write abortion curbs into their laws the 
court guaranteed every legislature a flood of abortion bills that 
will divide and sometimes dominate each of the 50 state capitols 
the organizations the strategies the campaign war chests and 
the wrath built over 16 years of legalized abortion in the national 
arena will be turned now toward the legislatures and their members 
activists on both sides said they intend to force every candidate 
at every level of politics to choose a side 
abortion stands at the intersection of morality theology 
privacy and womens rights there are few if any neutral parties 
on that corner 
one advocate of a right to abortion said the issue will be to the 
1990s what vietnam was to an earlier political generation 
that is an ominous prospect for the leaders whom americans have 
elected to deal with the traditional task of governing a job 
requiring compromise and civility even in disagreement in the 
abortion struggle there is no room for compromise it is the 
political equivalent of war and there is no consorting with the 
enemy 
activists on the subject wrote the book on singleissue politics 
the electoral school in which it makes no difference how close a 
candidates views may be to that of the voter if they disagree on 
one litmustest topic abortion is that kind of topic 
since the court legalized abortion in 1973 basing that decision 
on a womans constitutional right to privacy the antiabortion 
movement has taken to the streets has shouted down candidates 
demonstrated blocked the doors to abortion clinics 
its forces have shouted accusations of murder at democratic 
presidential candidates waving grisly placards at campaign rallies 
in an effort to penalize politicians who would not support a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortion 
abortionrights organizations have been trying to defend what 
they won in the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
the antiabortion side has been on the attack campaigning to 
overturn that decision by constitutional amendment to impede it in 
the streets and to challenge it in the courts the supreme court 
decision on monday does not overturn the 1973 ruling but permits 
and according to the dissent of justice harry blackmun invites the 
states to limit it 
more than a dozen states already have standby laws restricting 
abortion nearly three dozen require parental consent for abortions 
for minors most of the states have sought to bar financing of 
abortions under the medicaid program of care for the needy 
according to the national abortion rights action league more 
than 250 restrictive bills have been introduced in state 
legislatures just since last year 
at least 29 abortionlinked political action committees pro and 
con are registered with the federal election commission 
there will be more bills more fundraising committees more

the supreme court on monday accepted its 
firstever righttodie case agreeing to decide whether a 
missouri couple can remove their braindamaged daughter from a 
lifesupport system 
nancy cruzan 31 has been in what doctors describe as a 
persistent vegetative condition since a january 1983 car crash 
her parents joe and joyce cruzan want to remove the feeding 
tube surgically planted in her stomach without it doctors said she 
would die of starvation or dehydration with it they said she may 
live for 30 years or more 
the court said it would review a 43 ruling of the missouri 
supreme court that forbid doctors from removing the tube a decision 
is expected next year 
we are pretty elated around here her father said in a 
telephone interview from carterville mo after learning the case 
will be heard by the nations highest court we are trying to do 
what nancy would want us to do 
ms cruzan is able to breathe on her own and has periods of 
wakefulness in which her eyes move randomly in all directions 
doctors say she is incapable of reacting or relating to her 
environment and can experience no thoughts or emotions 
her hands and feet have constricted bent into claw shapes 
because of the brain damage 
her parents said their daughter at one time had said she would 
not want to be kept alive in such a condition 
but the missouri supreme court said we find no principled 
legal basis which permits the coguardians in this case to choose 
the death of their ward the states interest is in the preservation 
of life not only nancys life but also the lives of persons 
similarly situated yet without the support of a loving family 
it added we choose to err on the side of life respecting the 
rights of incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a 
severely diminished quality of life 
the state supreme court overturned a judges ruling that would 
have allowed the cruzans to order the feeding tube removed 
the missouri legislature has enacted a law a socalled living 
will statute that permits the withdrawal of artificial 
lifesupport systems from hopelessly ill and injured patients but 
the law specifically forbids withholding food and water from them 
the american medical association and other organizations joined 
the cruzans in urging the supreme court to overturn the state court 
ruling 
the medical groups said us hospitals care for from 5000 to 
10000 people in a persistent vegetative state 
the organizations said many state legislatures and a handful of 
state appeals courts have approved the withdrawal of lifesupport 
systems in such cases 
the supreme court has declined in the past to study the 
righttodie issue 
missouri attorney general william webster whose office argued 
against removing the feeding tube said he is glad the court decided 
to hear the case 
there are families all across the country that deserve a 
definite statement from the supreme court on the issue webster 
said there is a split among the lower courts on this issue and it 
is appropriate that the highest court in the land consider the 
issue 
in the most publicized case to reach them the justices let stand 
a 1976 new jersey supreme court ruling that allowed the removal of a 
respirator helping karen ann quinlan breathe 
ms quinlan also in an irreversible vegetative state continued 
to be fed through a tube and lived an additional nine years 
the case is cruzan vs missouri department of health 881503

indian soldiers swept through the 
northern jungles and detained 125 suspected tamil tiger rebels 
indian officials said monday five of the militants were killed in 
the operation 
the offensive codenamed storm was launched after the 
rebels stepped up attacks on the indian peacekeeping troops said a 
spokeswoman at the indian high commission or embassy 
indian newspapers said the sweep against the dominant liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam group began 10 days ago and involved at least 
20000 troops backed by helicopter gunships 
five militants were killed during the operation and troops have 
been ordered to continue the pressure on the tamil tigers said 
the spokeswoman who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
she had no other details about the operation but said 108 rebels 
were killed and 47 were captured last month while the indians 
suffered 40 casualties 
a tamil rebel leader in colombo said the indian gunships shelled 
and destroyed villages in the jungles of vavuniya mullaitivu and 
kilinochi 
the offensive was confined to aerial bombardment but we have 
yet to face the worst said the rebel leader speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
a sri lankan military official said a dusktodawn curfew had 
been imposed in many towns in the area since saturday 
last week president ranasinghe premadasa asked india to cease 
operations against the tamil tigers the main rebel militia fighting 
for an independent nation in the northeast 
india rejected premadasas request saying a decision could be 
taken only if the tamil tigers surrendered arms and refrained from 
violence 
premadasas appeal came a day after his government opened 
independent negotiations with the rebels aimed at ending the 
separatist campaign 
an earlier attempt to end the movement was made by premadasas 
predecessor junius r jayewardene which resulted in an 
indiabrokered peace accord that brought the indian troops to sri 
lanka 
the accord signed on july 29 1987 promised local autonomy to 
the ethnic minority tamils in exchange for an arms surrender by the 
the various tamil rebel groups 
while most groups gave up the violence the tamil tigers reneged 
on the accord and began attacking indian soldiers at least 800 
soldiers and 1500 rebels have died in the twoyearold bush war 
india has also rejected premadasas request to withdraw its 
estimated 45000 troops by the end of july saying a hasty pullout 
could lead to even greater violence 
india became involved in the tamil war because of the sympathies 
of its own 60 million tamils 
tamils in sri lanka form 18 percent of the countrys 16 million 
people and claim they are discriminated against by the majority 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and the military 
at least 9000 people have been killed in the tamil separatist 
war and another 3500 have died in a backlash by radical sinhalese

a deliberately set blaze caused minor damage 
to an abortion clinic monday eight hours before the us supreme 
court announced its ruling limiting the right to an abortion 
authorities said 
police said they were notifying federal authorities because of 
the circumstances 
where its at a feminist health center and theres been this 
nationwide thing involving them abortion clinics we felt that we 
should notify them said jim moran director of investigations for 
the concord police 
fire officials received an alarm at 220 am said capt jack 
davis fire prevention officer the fire confined to a bookcase in 
one room in the unoccupied building was put out with a portable 
extinguisher officials said 
the case was incendiary meaning it was intentionally set 
said davis 
moran said there was a hole in a window near where the fire began 
patty baum who works at the center said she believes abortion 
opponents were responsible 
they say theyre so peaceful and prolife yet theyre willing 
to destroy buildings and risk lives there potentially could have 
been someone in there she told the concord monitor 
but russell pond director of the new hampshire prolife council 
called it irresponsible to cast blame before anyone is caught 
it could have been set by those who want to cast a bad light on 
the prolife movement he said 
a number of arrests were made earlier this year at the clinic 
which is a frequent target of antiabortion picketing

the us postal service temporarily suspended 
home mail delivery on a street in this bluecollar boston suburb

druginfested area 
our first responsibility is to protect our letter carriers 
said lynn postal supervisor richard coppinger

fight broke out between two occupants of an apartment building 
vine street residents said they were angered by the decision to 
end mail delivery to the entire street 
its very unfair for us said nathan guy 23 there are 
only certain people responsible and theyve made the whole street

british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said 
monday there was no way hong kongs 37 million people could 
move to britain to escape communist rule 
protesters interrupted howes speech to community leaders 
unfurling a banner reading shame on the thatcher government 
this speech is insulting the intelligence of hong kong 
chinese we protest and we walk out shouted lee wing tat a 
community leader who stormed from the hall with about eight other 
demonstrators 
local politicians criticized the speech as totally 
unconstructive and disappointing 
howe indicated some hong kong chinese who have provided valuable 
service to the colony would be allowed to settle in britain but he 
provided no details 
he also said britain would open its doors to hong kong residents 
and mobilize the international community to do the same if things 
did go catastrophically wrong in the territory once china resumes 
political control of hong kong in 1997 
the plain fact is that there is simply no way that the british 
government could grant to several million people the right to come 
and live in britain howe told about 250 community leaders 
it dismays me that some have suggested that this is a matter of 
race it is nothing of the sort howe said it is a practical 
problem that would test britians capacity in housing employment 
and transportation 
howe said britain is considering plans to speed up local 
democratic reform and draft a bill of rights for the colony 
he also pledged a thorough reexamination of a clause in the 
constitution for post1997 hong kong being drafted by china that 
allows beijing authorities to declare a state of emergency in the 
territory 
hong kong residents have demanded the right to live in britain 
since china unleashed a violent crackdown on the movement for 
freedom in beijings tiananmen square 
although more than 3 million hong kong chinese are eligible for 
british passports they are not allowed to live in britain 
under the 1984 britishchinese agreement china guarantees that 
hong kong can keep its capitalist system and freedoms for 50 years 
after the turnover and enjoy a high degree of autonomy 
howe on a threeday mission to gauge opinion in the colony after 
the beijing crackdown said china has a huge economic stake in hong 
kong he said china remains committed to keeping the territory 
prosperous and stable 
hong kong has seen hard times before youve always shown the 
resilience and the resourcefulness to live through such times and 
emerge from them stronger than ever before he said hong kongs 
future will im sure continue that bold tradition 
the heckling at howes speech was extremely rare in this british 
colony it demonstrated the degree of bitterness many of hong kongs 
people feel toward londons refusal to grant them the right to live 
in britain 
albert cheng head of the rightofabode organization said he 
found the speech totally unconstructive 
when someone comes to hong kong from so high up and delivers a 
speech like that i am sure it will hamper the confidence of the 
people once more he said 
he described the feelings of hong kongs people as frustrated 
disappointed and angry 
legislative councillor dame lydia dunn said she found the speech 
disappointing because it included nothing new

herman cohen the new us 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs said monday he 
believes angolas civil war will be settled by the end of the year 
angolas cuban and sovietbacked government has been fighting 
rebels armed by south africa and the united states for 12 years but 
the two sides agreed last month at an african summit in zaire to a 
ceasefire and negotiations 
there have been some tremendously important developments in 
angola and i believe its on the right track cohen said i 
expect a final settlement in angola certainly before the end of this 
year 
the process is slower in mozambique he said both countries are 
former portuguese colonies where guerrillas wars broke out when the 
portuguese hastily withdrew in the late 1970s south africa 
supported rebels in both countries but now states that policy has 
ended 
in mozambique i believe things seem to be moving toward a 
political settlement a bit more slowly than angola but i think its 
on the right track as well cohen said 
he arrived in south africa on sunday night and is to visit 
angola mozambique zambia the congo and ivory coast he said in 
general he is optimistic about the southern african situation but 
would not comment specifically on us policy toward south africa 
until president bushs administration completes a policy review 
expected by the end of september 
however he did say there must be a negotiated settlement 
nothing can be done unilaterally in this country anymore 
foreign minister pik botha who had just met with cohen for more 
than an hour nodded in agreement cohen spoke to reporters as he 
walked out of the foreign ministry building 
cohen met monday with law and order minister adriaan vlok and 
invited govan mbeki a member of the outlawed african national 
congress and the south african communist party to dinner monday 
night 
mbeki was among eight anc leaders given life sentences in 1964 
for plotting to overthrow the government he was released in 1987 
because he was ill mbeki is banned from speaking publicly being 
quoted by the press or leaving his home in port elizabeth without 
police permission

prochoice groups monday said the supreme 
courts abortion decision is a giant step backward that 
threatens the livelihoods and health of american women but abortion 
foes cheered the ruling as a victory for life 
this is an outrage said judith widdicombe founder of 
reproductive health services the missouri clinic involved in the 
court decision this is the beginning of a war it will become our 
vietnam of the 1990s 
the courts decision is a victory for life and the biggest 
winners today are the tiniest people of all children within the 
womb said archbishop john l may of st louis president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops 
the court stopped short of overturning its 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion but in allowing missouri to 
restrict the use of public money medical personnel and facilities 
in performing abortions the justices gave states new freedom to 
restrict a womans right to end a pregnancy 
people for the american way a nonpartisan constitutional 
liberties group predicted a state by state bloodletting that 
could be among the most painful in our history 
the court also appeared to invite further challenges to its 
landmark ruling it said it will hear three new abortion cases next 
term 
the ruling begins the process of restoring a fundamental right 
of the american people the right to protect human life said 
john willke president of the national right to life committee 
we are horrified said lori schroyer spokeswoman for the 
california abortion rights action league access to abortion is 
going to be limited to those of privilege it will force people 
across state lines and into back alleys 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said the ruling is a giant step backward for 
this country and a tremendous loss of liberty for every american 
womens lives hang by a thread and the justices this morning 
handed politicians a pair of scissors she said 
randall terry founder and director of operation rescue whose 
members have blockaded abortion clinics across the country said the 
ruling is the first step toward ending abortion nationwide 
its a faltering step under which children will continue to be 
murdered but this decision indicates that roes days are 
numbered he said 
sen orrin hatch rutah and a key abortion foe in congress 
called the ruling a major victory for the prolife cause and 
said he remains hopeful the court will soon overturn roe 
outright 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said the series of votes that restored key provisions of a missouri 
law restricting abortion shows we are only one justices vote away 
from complete reversal of roe 
this is the first of a onetwo punch that will completely knock 
out abortion rights she said 
now and the many other groups favoring abortionrights for women 
said they will begin lobbying statehouses across the country and 
promised to make abortion a major issue in elections nationwide 
every person who stands for election in this country is going 
to have to answer yard said 
norma mccorvey who as jane roe brought the case that led to 
the 1973 ruling said she was deeply disappointed by mondays 
decision 
it saddens my heart very deeply to know that poor women are 
once again going to be out there going to backstreet abortions and 
possibly be mutilated mccorvey a dallas housekeeper told cable 
news network 
the center for population options said the ruling will sentence 
thousands of teenagers each year to bear children they are not 
ready emotionally physically or financially to raise 
access to abortion is going to be limited to those of 
privilege it will force people across state lines and into back 
alleys lori schroyer spokeswoman for the california abortion 
rights action league 
patricia schroeder dcolo said the decision made women wards 
of the state their rights are all dependent on what states decide 
to do 
sarah weddington a texas attorney who successfully argued the 
roe vs wade case in 1973 said that while the decision is effective 
immediately it will have no practical implication until state 
legislatures pass new laws 
so in terms of is abortion legal or illegal in the various 
states tomorrow its going to be the same as today but what we are 
going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative activity in all of 
the state legislatures depending on which ones are in session and 
which ones are not she said 
despite that reassurance many women appeared to be fearing the 
worst 
at womens health services inc a pittsburgh abortion clinic 
executive director sue roselle said the telephones are ringing 
off the hook women are saying i want my abortion now before they 
change the law

international monetary fund fund because it has fallen behind on 
repayments of 163 million borrowed earlier 
panamas total debt is over 5 billion 
there are 151 member governments in the fund including panama 
the united states has the largest bloc of votes 
the funds external relations department announced that the ban 
on panama was decided by the 22 members of the executive board who 
meet behind closed doors they usually act by consensus 
us financial sanctions against noriega since 1987 following 
his indictment on drug charges in this country have so far failed 
to dislodge him from his commanding position at the head of panamas 
armed forces 
acting president manuel solis palma said in march that the us 
ban on payments to the panama government caused a 20 percent drop in 
the countrys production last year 
panama becomes the ninth government to be banned from receiving 
new loans from the fund the others are vietnam guayana liberia 
sudan peru zambia sierra leone and somalia arrears in repayments 
to the fund have been authoritatively estimated at close to 3 
billion both from these nine countries and from others which have 
not yet fallen far enough behind to be sanctioned 
in the past debtor countries gave priority to meeting their 
obligations to the fund but arrears have piled up in the continuing 
debt crisis that began in 1982

prosecutors may seek felony charges against 
rep donald lukens if he successfully appeals a misdemeanor 
conviction of having sex with a 16yearold girl the prosecutors 
office said monday 
the charges would stem from accusations that lukens had sex with 
the same girl when she was 13 said tom tornabene a spokesman for 
franklin county prosecutor michael miller 
if on appeal the conviction is overturned we will consider 
pursuing felony charges no final decision has been made yet 
tornabene said 
thomas tyack an attorney for the 58yearold republican 
congressman said disclosing such a plan was an attempt to 
discourage lukens from pursuing an appeal 
lukens was sentenced friday to 30 days in jail and fined 500 on 
a charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor he is free on 
bond pending appeal 
on may 26 a franklin county jury convicted lukens after hearing 
rosie coffman testify that lukens paid her 40 and gave her gifts 
after having sex with her at his columbus apartment last november 
ms coffman now 17 told the jury that lukens knew she was 
underage 
in february the grand jury that indicted lukens on the 
misdemeanor charge also considered allegations that he had sex with 
ms coffman not only last year when she was 16 but in 1985 when she 
was 13 when it would have been a felony charge 
but the grand jury cited conflicting testimony from the girl and 
did not indict lukens on the more serious charge 
tournabene said that since february however another witness 
with information about the alleged 1985 incident has been located 
who would be available to testify before a second grand jury 
little testimony relating to ms coffmans relationship with 
lukens before last november was admitted at trial but the girl 
referred to it several times on the stand 
lukens served two terms in congress in the 1960s and early 1970s 
before dropping out in an unsuccessful try for the ohio 
governorship he was elected to the house again in 1986 and was 
reelected last november

sarah weddington the texas attorney whose 
victorious arguments in roe vs wade legalized abortion 16 years 
ago called the supreme court decision monday carving back that 
right a personal defeat 
saying she was wrung out by the ruling upholding missouri 
regulations limiting abortion rights ms weddington said at a news 
conference that it was up to the young to carry on the fight 
ms weddington 44 represented norma mccorvey a dallas woman 
who took the pseudonym jane roe in the landmark 1973 case 
she called mondays ruling a personal defeat and said the day had 
been burned into her memory 
my heart stopped and my mouth went dry she said ive 
invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been handed a 
major defeat 
ms weddington said she had expected the court to whittle 
away the case that established the abortion precedent 
but she added i did not expect what they did and that was to 
chop away at that decision 
she said the future of the abortion issue rests with young 
adults but she vowed to continue to speak out for the cause 
the court in a series of mostly 54 votes restored several 
missouri abortion regulations that a lower court had invalidated for 
unduly interfering with womens constitutional right to abortion 
ms weddington questioned the implications of the missouri law 
which defines life as beginning at conception on some forms of 
birth control and in vitro fertilization 
frankly it makes me tired to think about the future ms 
weddington told reporters at texas womans university where she is 
an adjunct professor 
young adults must pick up the fight to maintain abortion rights 
she said 
if people dont really say no were not going to have this 
if they dont lobby their own state legislatures abortion will 
become illegal she predicted

taxpayersupported facilities comes as an apparently declining 
number of such hospitals are performing the procedure 
the number of public hospitals providing abortions in 1985 was 
265 down from 331 in 1982 according to the latest complete 
statistics from the alan guttmacher institute a private research 
organization specializing in sexual issues 
the total number of hospitals providing abortions in 1985 was 
1191 versus 1405 in 1982 according to the institute 
the institute had no figures on how many abortions are performed 
in public hospitals 
about 12 percent of the roughly 16 million abortions performed 
in the united states each year are paid for with public money 
statistics indicate 
the supreme courts rulings on monday gave states the right to 
ban the use of public hospitals or taxpayersupported facilities to 
perform abortions not necessary to save a womans life states may 
also ban public employees from performing those abortions 
in 1985 66171000 in public money paid for 187997 abortions 
according to the guttmacher institute states paid for all but 484 
which were paid for by the federal government 
in 1985 there were 1588550 abortions reported in the country 
118 percent of which were publicly funded that percentage has 
likely remained steady in succeeding years the institute said 
thirteen percent of all abortions were performed in hospitals 60 
percent in abortion clinics 23 percent in other clinics and 4 
percent in physicians offices the institute reported 
abortion clinics made up only 15 percent of the providers but 
accounted for 60 percent of all abortions of all abortions 
performed in 1985 75 percent took place in facilities having annual 
caseloads of at least 1000

defense minister dmitri t yazov won his bid for 
reappointment monday but his support among soviet lawmakers was so 
lukewarm that he would have been rejected without a lastminute 
procedural change 
yazov criticized by some members of the supreme soviet as too 
conservative and too old for the post garnered 256 votes in his 
favor with 77 against and 66 abstentions soviet television 
reported 
legislators main objections concerned the age of the 
candidate and his traditional way of thinking the official 
news agency tass said 
others accused yazov 65 of paying too little attention to 
soldiers living conditions tass said 
earlier monday the legislature decided that to be confirmed 
nominees needed only a majority of those members actually attending 
the session formerly nominees needed a majority of the entire 
542member supreme soviet 
the procedural change followed last fridays failure by vladimir 
kamentsev the nominee for head of the foreign economic commission 
to receive the required 272 votes from among about 400 legislators 
attending tass said monday a second vote would be held on his 
confirmation 
yazov who holds the rank of general of the army was appointed 
defense minister in may 1987 he replaced sergei sokolov who was 
fired after west german teenager mathias rust evaded soviet air 
defenses and landed his light aircraft in red square 
several legislators said other generals were more qualified than 
yazov including the head of the joint chiefs of staff gen mikhail 
moiseyev and gen boris gromov who commanded soviet troops in 
afghanistan 
but a majority regarded the candidates stand set out in his 
answers to deputies questions as convincing enough for his 
appointment to the post of defense minister tass said 
president mikhail s gorbachev endorsed yazov saying he holds 
progressive views and has made impressive contributions in 
restructuring the soviet armed forces tass said 
yazov replying to questions from deputies said the military 
doctrine of the soviet union should be defined only by the political 
leadership and that the job of the defense minister is to implement 
that doctrine 
the supreme soviet which has been revamped under gorbachevs 
political reforms into a smaller fulltime legislature has broken 
in the past days from its traditional automatic approval of the 
leaderships nominees 
last week its committees rejected seven nominees including a 
gorbachev protege who was nominated to head the governments food 
program under pressure from lawmakers premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
withdrew their names from consideration by the full body 
the rejected nominees included culture minister vasily zakharov 
and vladimir gribov head of the state bank 
in other action at mondays session the supreme soviet approved 
as finance minister valentin pavlov who told the legislature he was 
against introducing currency reforms until the economy improves 
tass reported 
it appointed lev ryabev as the cabinets energy chief after 
grilling him on his positions on atomic power stations and nuclear 
waste disposal 
as yazovs nomination was debated the defense ministry released 
draft changes in military manuals to bring them in line with the 
latest changes in the countrys political structure tass said 
the drafts give greater legal protection for individual soldiers 
and call for improved living conditions for soldiers and their 
families 
the supreme soviet is aiming to complete the formation of the new 
soviet government involving about 50 additional appointments by 
the end of this week gorbachev announced monday

president bush welcoming the supreme 
court decision allowing abortions to be restricted said today the 
court appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability 
to protect the unborn 
bush has voiced support for a constitutional amendment to 
overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized abortions 
we continue to believe that roe v wade was incorrectly decided 
and should be reversed bushs statement said 
but it said by upholding the missouri statute the court 
appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability to 
protect the unborn 
chief of staff john sununu told a white house briefing bush would 
continue to actively support a constitutional amendment he said 
todays ruling might help build support for one now that the 
court has moved incrementally in this direction 
in the written statement bush said americans obviously differ 
over the difficult issue underlying this case the morality and 
appropriate legal status of abortion 
any decision in this area will stir strong feelings 
nevertheless i have confidence that the american people will 
continue to express their deeply held convictions on this subject 
within the bounds of civility and our legal institutions bush 
continued 
earlier he voiced condolences to the family of the late soviet 
president andrei a gromyko 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president would 
be playing golf this afternoon and had no plans to react personally 
to the abortion decision 
he hasnt had a chance to look at it yet fitzwater said when 
asked if bush had any immediate reaction to the courts decision 
bush told reporters he first met gromyko in 1971 when bush was 
us representative to the united nations gromyko longtime soviet 
foreign minister died sunday at age 79 
id just like to send condolences to his son anatoly who i 
also know and to the rest of the family bush told reporters as 
he began the day with a 20minute jog 
bush was asked for his reaction on the supreme court decision as 
he played golf with professional doug sanders at a local course 
my position is very well known bush said and now id 
like to concentrate on something else he added brushing off 
further questions 
bush also planned to treat his neighbors to a dayearly 
independence day fireworks celebration 
im tired bush 65 confessed sunday after a day of jogging 
tennis swimming fishing golf and then more fishing 
bush said sunday he regretted the decision of adm william j 
crowe to step down as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in 
september 
very candidly id like to have had him stay bush told 
reporters on the golf course he did an outstanding job and is 
doing an outstanding job 
crowe announced his decision sunday on nbctvs meet the 
press 
hundreds of people were expected to line the shoreline of this 
oceanside resort to watch the bush fireworks this evening to be set 
off from his sixacre compound on walkers point by the same company 
that did the 1986 statue of liberty fireworks in new york harbor 
fitzwater said an anonymous donor helped subsidize the 20000 
display by the new castle pa company of pyrotechnics specialist 
george zambelli zambelli has said he expects to set off two tons of 
aerial explosives in the 15minute display 
bushs stand on abortion has changed since he supported the right 
of a woman to choose an abortion when he first ran for president in 
1980 more recently he has favored a constitutional amendment to 
outlaw the procedure 
it is one of four constitutional amendments bush is advocating 
the others call for a balanced federal budget lineitem veto 
authority on spending bills and most recently an amendment to 
restore the right of states and congress to ban flagdesecration a 
power the supreme court stripped away last week in a controversial 
54 decision 
the presidents flag pronouncements won bush a fair degree of 
public support including from bartleys dockside restaurant in 
downtown kennebunkport which displays a different sign out front 
each time the president visits 
this weekends offering protecting our flag means protecting 
our freedom thanks mr president were glad youre here 
bush on sunday jogged went to church swam played tennis got a 
carryout lunch in his boat went ocean fishing played nine holes 
of golf and then waded into the kennebunk river to cast for striped 
bass 
aides said the president also planned during his fiveday 
extended holiday to bone up with briefing books for his upcoming 
trip to poland hungary and the sevennation economic summit but so 
far his days have been crammed with recreational activities 
thirtyfive members of the bush family are in town for the 
independence day festivities 
after morning services at st anns episcopal church bush 
plunged into a crowd of several hundred onlookers who had gathered 
outside shaking hands and wishing people well 
i hope we get out there on the water do some fun stuff bush 
told one person in the crowd 
the independence day fireworks have become a bush family 
tradition in recent years 
however because this years display was to be more ambitious 
than previous ones the bush fireworks were moved up to monday night 
so they would not compete with town fireworks scheduled for the 
fourth of july

former foreign minister andrei a gromyko the dour 
diplomat who served and survived every soviet leader from josef 
stalin until mikhail s gorbachevs new thinking pushed him out 
has died at age 79 
a tough negotiator he helped guide soviet foreign policy through 
the twists of cold war and detente whoever was in charge at the 
kremlin 
gromyko spent 28 years as foreign minister and held several other 
government and communist party posts over half a century including 
the thenlargely ceremonial post of president but was a private 
citizen in retirement when he died sunday 16 days before his 80th 
birthday he lost his last position a seat on the party central 
committee in april 
no cause of death was announced but a foreign ministry spokesman 
said friday that gromyko had undergone surgery for an unspecified 
vascular problem soviet tv in a fiveminute announcement reviewing 
gromykos life said he died after a long illness 
gorbachev announced the statesmans death monday in a session of 
the supreme soviet legislature 
his whole life was connected with history with our 
achievements our problems with everything that falls on the lot of 
a person in the thick of events for whole decades gorbachev said 
after deputies observed a minute of silence 
tass the official news agency called gromyko one of the major 
soviet diplomats and statesmen of the senior generation 
gromyko was the ultimate technocrat and a model bureaucrat 
executing policy without shaping it with no political constituency 
of his own he posed no threat to the kremlin hierarchy a surefire 
formula for surviving 
as a diplomat and foreign minister gromyko helped forge the 
alliance that won world war ii he joined in drafting the un 
charter and participated in superpower talks that shaped the modern 
world 
he outlasted stalin nikita s khrushchev leonid i brezhnev 
yuri v andropov and konstantin u chernenko as an ambassador he 
served in the united states britain and the united nations 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said gromyko 
was part of our history with all its good sides and all its bad 
sides and historians should judge whether his influence was 
good or bad gerasimov spoke to reporters in paris where he had 
gone in advance of a visit by gorbachev 
the funeral will be held wednesday after the body lies in state 
for five hours in the red banner hall at soviet army headquarters 
the nightly news program vremya reported 
burial will be at novodevichy cemetery the second most 
prestigious resting place after the kremlin it said khrushchev 
anastas i mikoyan and vyacheslav m molotov are buried there 
in a condolence statement on behalf of the us government 
president bush noted that gromyko knew every us president from 
franklin roosevelt to george bush and every secretary of state from 
cordell hull to james baker 
gromykos death marks the passing of a generation that 
witnessed many of the most historic events of this century bush 
said 
james callaghan the former british prime minister and foreign 
secretary said gromyko was a good executor of a bad foreign 
policy that has now changed 
jean francoisponcet a former french foreign minister said 
gromyko was certainly one of those who incited the soviet union to 
invade afghanistan and as a consequence one of those whom mr 
gorbachev wanted to put aside us ambassador jack matlock 
said even when relations were difficult he was always 
professionally courteous and considerate 
andrei andreyevich gromyko was born july 18 1909 into a 
byelorussian peasant family 
during world war ii he took over the foreign ministrys us 
section and was appointed ambassador to washington in 1943 at 39 
the youngest ambassador in soviet history 
his career took him to tehran potsdam and yalta where one story 
says winston churchill threw cigar butts at gromyko after he 
whispered into stalins ear that he should demand germanys 
unconditional surrender 
gromyko stepped down as the first soviet ambassador to the united 
nations in 1948 but returned almost annually to rail against us 
policies 
some observers attributed gromykos political longevity to his 
flexibility diplomatic expertise and apparent disinterest in 
obtaining power for himself he was not admitted to the politburo 
until 1973 
khrushchev who appointed gromyko foreign minister in 1957 and 
often insulted him once said in his presence if i tell him to 
sit on an iceberg hell stay there and freeze but he wont move 
gromyko gained a reputation as mr nyet for casting frequent 
vetoes as un ambassador he was nicknamed grim grom because he 
rarely smiled and his craggy face was instantly recognizable to the 
world 
during andropovs leadership in 198284 gromykos star rose in 
march 1983 he became first deputy premier in addition to foreign 
minister and politburo member 
when gorbachev gained power in 1985 gromyko supported his 
reforms and displayed official respect even when the new leadership 
condemned some foreign policy decisions taken during his tenure 
including the soviet intervention in afghanistan 
gromyko did not escape unscathed 
a delegate to a party conference last summer suggested he and 
others who shaped policy in the brezhnev era resign the delegate 
was rebuffed but gromyko was dropped from the ruling politburo and 
presidency a few months later 
to replace gromyko as foreign minister in 1985 gorbachev chose 
eduard a shevardnadze a party official with no previous foreign 
experience to represent new thinking intended to dispel the 
kremlins enemy image and improve relations abroad 
gromyko served as president a largely ceremonial post after 
shevardnadze replaced him gorbachev in taking over the job of 
president oct 1 has transformed it into a powerful executive 
position 
gromyko had not appeared in public for months and little was 
known about his health he is believed to have suffered a mild 
stroke several years ago that may have partially paralyzed his face 
and affected his speech 
at the un general assembly in september 1978 he slumped while 
speaking and had to be escorted away he returned to the podium an 
hour later and finished the speech 
many officials have been dismissed and written out of official 
history books when new leaders took over the kremlin but gromyko 
ended his career gracefully after helping vote gorbachev into power 
former secretary of state cyrus r vance praised gromykos skill 
as a thoroughly professional practitioner of the diplomatic 
trade he has few peers in the modern world vance said he 
represents his country with great skill high intelligence and 
spirit tempered in decades of experience 
behind gromykos poker face was a sharp wit asked once whether 
he had enjoyed his breakfast he replied perhaps

a divided supreme court ruled monday that 
states are free to impose new restrictions on abortions igniting 
intense reaction and throwing the volatile issue back to the 
legislatures 
in an endofthe term decision cheered by abortion foes the 
justices stopped short of overturning a 1973 ruling under which 
women have the right to seek abortions but in a series of rulings 
many of them 54 they upheld several provisions of a missouri law 
that imposed new restraints and signaled they might be willing to 
impose greater restrictions in cases to be heard next year 
justice harry a blackmun author of the 1973 ruling said 
mondays very ominous decision in a missouri abortion dispute 
suggests the court may scrap roe vs wade as early as next year a 
chill wind blows he said 
an impatient justice antonin scalia who voted monday to reverse 
the 1973 ruling wrote it appears that the mansion of 
constitutionalized abortion law constructed overnight in roe vs 
wade must be disassembled doorjamb by doorjamb 
antiabortion activists hailed the decision we are thumbs up 
all the way said john willke president of the national right to 
life committee elaine bingham a spokeswoman for operation rescue 
said this is the first step in overturning roe vs wade 
such a reversal would leave states free to impose stringent 
regulations on or even outlaw abortion 
for the past decade some 15 million legal abortions have been 
performed each year in the united states 
abortion rights advocates reacted angrily 
this is war against women said molly yard president of the 
national organization for women pretty soon nothing much will be 
left for a woman in controlling her reproductive life 
by 54 votes the justices reversed a federal appeals court 
ruling that had invalidated key provisions of a missouri abortion 
law 
perhaps most significantly the courts slim majority ruled that 
states may require doctors to determine through various testing 
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is viable or capable of 
surviving outside the womb missouri and many states make it a crime 
to abort a viable fetus 
roe vs wade which said women have a constitutional right to 
abortion prohibited states from protecting fetal life until the 
24th week of a pregnancy 
the 1973 landmark said a womans decision to have an abortion 
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and 
her doctor it said states may regulate abortions during the second 
trimester only to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester 
state authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester 
was not made absolute however

justice harry a blackmun author of the 
supreme courts abortionlegalizing opinion in 1973 said monday the 
courts new decision sets the stage for an outright ban that would 
cast in darkness the hope of every woman in this country 
for today the women of this nation still retain the liberty to 
control their destinies blackmun wrote but the signs are 
evident and very ominous and a chill wind blows 
blackmun 80 acknowledged that the landmark roe vs wade 
decision of 1973 remains in place and abortion remains legal but he 
was critical of what he called the courts silence on the 
implications of its ruling upholding missouri restrictions on 
abortion 
by refusing to explain or justify its proposal blackmun 
said the court invites charges of cowardice and illegitimacy to 
our door 
the silence is callous blackmun said during an unusual 
nineminute reading of his opinion from the bench it is also 
profoundly disruptive of this court as an institution 
in his opinion blackmun said three court members chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white and anthony m 
kennedy were trying to overrule roe vs wade silently and 
accused that triumvirate of going about its business in a 
deceptive fashion 
justice thurgood marshall who joined in the dissent watched 
intently as blackmun read it in a calm voice in the supreme court 
chamber other justices had impassive expressions 
blackmun said that reversal of roe vs wade would force hundreds 
of thousands of women each year to defy the law and place their 
health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands of 
backalley abortionists or they would attempt to perform abortions 
upon themselves with disastrous results 
every year many women especially poor and minority women 
would die or suffer debilitating trauma all in the name of enforced 
morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion as it may be 
blackmun was considered a conservative when named to the court by 
thenpresident nixon but he soon carved out an place among court 
moderates 
when one is here he develops his constitutional philosophy i 
would hope that in that respect i at least have grown he said in 
a 1986 interview id like to think that i am a little more 
sensitive to basic rights than i was before

the historic treaty oak which has provided 
shade for generations of texans will itself be shaded as part of 
the effort to save the majestic tree that was poisoned with a 
herbicide 
the whole plan of attack is to try and minimize the stress on 
the tree paul roberts an environmental specialist with the 
austin parks and recreation department said monday 
later this week 40foot screens will be stretched across sets of 
poles on the east and west sides of the 65foothigh centuriesold 
tree the mesh screens are made of a fabric similar to the kind used 
to block sun and wind at tennis courts 
there is tender foliage up there it would be real easy to fry 
it roberts said he said the screens will reduce sunlight hitting 
the tree by 50 percent to 60 percent 
were coming into a real stressful period for the tree we can 
expect upper 90s 100degrees for the next two months he said 
legend has it stephen f austin the father of texas made peace 
with indians under the trees branches 
leaves have turned brown and fallen off the tree since it was 
poisoned with the potent herbicide velpar in what police say was a 
ritual act to cast a spell or curse police have charged a man with 
criminal mischief he could get 20 years in prison 
workers are replacing soil that was excavated around the tree to 
a depth of about 30 inches to remove any herbicide residue 
in addition 12 sprinkler heads have been placed in the trees 
canopy to mist the foliage with water five minutes per hour to cool 
the tree roberts said 
latest test results indicate the tree was poisoned with more 
velpar than first suspected nearly three times the amount needed to 
kill the tree 
but tree experts determined the poison did not seep as far down 
in the ground as had been feared said bill edelbrock another 
environmental specialist with the parks department 
the poison travels through a plants roots and into the leaves 
and when the leaves fall the poison they contain soaks into the 
ground and the cycle begins again edelbrock said were out there 
raking up leaves every day he said

the supreme court on monday refused to bar 
states from imposing rules on labeling hazardous workplace 
substances that are more rigorous or extensive than federal 
regulations 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to a new jersey 
law by business and industry representatives who said federal law 
preempts such state rules 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last february upheld a 
federal judges ruling that allowed new jersey officials to enforce 
that states worker and community right to know act of 1983 
the appeals court said the judge was not clearly erroneous in 
deciding the state law does not stand as an obstacle to the 
accomplishment of the purposes of the federal occupational safety 
and health act of 1970 
the two laws are similar in their aim requiring employers to 
warn workers of hazardous materials the new jersey law also is 
intended to warn the public about potential threats to the 
environment 
the state law goes further than the federal law in some respects 
new jersey requires all chemical containers to be labeled while the 
federal law requires only containers of hazardous chemicals to be 
labeled 
the state requires that the five most predominant substances in a 
mixture be labeled the federal law does not 
and new jersey requires most labels to include the chemical name 
and a special number used to identify the substance the federal law 
requires the chemical or common name but not the number 
the state law was challenged by the new jersey chamber of 
commerce and numerous chemical flavor and fragrance manufacturers 
they said dual labeling would confuse and overwhelm workers 
the 2nd circuit court said there was adequate testimony by 
opposing experts that proper worker training would clear up any 
confusion 
the cases are new jersey chamber of commerce vs hughey 881845 
and fragrance materials association vs van note 881868

president bush on monday hailed the 
supreme court decision on abortion as a beginning to restore to 
the people the ability to protect the unborn 
but a top aide said bush does not plan to campaign on the issue 
in the states that now will have the power to restrict abortions 
the president also cautioned americans who have strong feelings 
on the issue to continue to express their deeply held convictions 
on this subject within the bounds of civility and our legal 
institutions 
in a twoparagraph statement released by his staff while he was 
on the golf course during his fiveday maine vacation bush said 
we welcome this decision the court appears to have begun to 
restore to the people the ability to protect the unborn 
chief of staff john sununu told reporters that bush continues to 
support a socalled human life amendment to the constitution that 
would bar abortion 
antiabortion members of congress have repeatedly pressed for 
such an amendment without success 
bush supports the approach of rep henry hyde rill said 
sununu however hyde has not introduced a constitutional amendment 
but rather an amendment to the health and human services 
approprations bill that would bar use of federal funds for abortion 
except when the mothers life is endangered 
bushs position on abortion is that it should be allowed only in 
cases of rape incest or endangerment to the life of the mother 
while sununu was briefing reporters bush was playing golf for 
much of the afternoon the president deflected questions on the 
abortion issue from reporters who accompanied him to the golf 
course referring them to the statement his staff released 
not when im doing this he said swinging his golf club his 
written statement he said would express his very strong 
feelings my position is very well known and now id like to 
concentrate on something else 
sununu said bush had been on the telephone with white house legal 
counsel boyden gray and other advisers talking about the legal 
nuances of the ruling he said it would merit further analysis 
but that bush wished initially to put out a statement expressing his 
support for the direction the court took 
this is the kind of issue that he is strongly supportive of but 
he understands that it moves now out into the states 
with mondays court decision restoring to the states the powers 
to restrict abortion rights sununu noted many states now will see 
legislative efforts to restrict abortion bush does not intend to 
personally lead the crusade for legal changes in those states said 
sununu 
he would probably continue to speak on it as a national issue 
rather than carrying the concern into the state capitals sununu 
said 
asked about a controversy that arose in last years presidential 
campaign when bush indicated during a debate with democratic 
contender michael dukakis that a woman who has an abortion should be 
penalized sununu said that bush did not want that result from 
future state laws on abortion 
when laws are written we would hope that they would focus on 
those who perform the abortion 
bushs staff hastened after last years debate to say that bush 
had not intended to call for penalties against women who had 
abortions 
the monday ruling stopped short of overturning the historic 1973 
supreme court roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
bush said in his statement that that decision was incorrectly 
decided and should be reversed

here are excerpts from mondays supreme court 
decision limiting religious displays on government property 
from justice harry a blackmuns majority opinion 
precisely because of the religious diversity that is our national 
heritage the founders added to the constitution a bill of rights 
the very first words of which declare congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof perhaps in the early days of the republic these 
words were understood to protect only the diversity within 
christianity but today they are recognized as guaranteeing 
religious diversity and equality to the infidel the atheist or the 
adherent of a nonchristian faith such as islam or judaism 
whether the key word is endorsement favoritism or promotion the 
essential principle remains the same the establishment clause at 
the very least prohibits government from appearing to take a 
position on questions of religious belief 
the governments use of religious symbolism is unconstitutional 
if it has the effect of endorsing religious beliefs and the effect 
of the governments use of religious symbolism depends upon its 
context accordingly our present task is to determine whether the 
display of the creche and the menorah in their respective 
particular physical settings has the effect of endorsing or 
disapproving religious beliefs 
the creche in this lawsuit uses words as well as the picture of 
the nativity scene to make its religious meaning unmistakably 
clear here nothing in the context of the display detracts from 
the creches religious message the county sends an unmistakable 
message that it supports and promotes the christian praise to god 
that is the creches religious message 
government may celebrate christmas in some manner and form but 
not in a way that endorses christian doctrine here allegheny 
county has transgressed this line 
the display of the chanukah menorah in front of the citycounty 
building may well present a closer constitutional question the 
menorah one must recognize is a religious symbol but the 
menorahs message is not exclusively religious the menorah is the 
primary visual symbol for a holiday that like christmas has both 
religious and secular dimensions 
moreover the menorah here stands next to a christams tree and a 
sign saluting liberty the display of the menorah is not an 
endorsement of religious faith but simply a recognition of cultural 
diversity 
for purposes of the establishment clause the citys overall 
display must be understood as conveying the citys secular 
recognition of different traditions for celebrating the winter 
holiday season 
 
from justice william j brennans partly concurring and partly 
dissenting opinion 
the citys erection alongside the christmas tree of the symbol of 
a relatively minor jewish religious holiday far from conveying the 
citys secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating 
the winter holiday season or a message of pluralism and freedom of 
belief has the effect of promoting a christianized version of 
judaism 
 
from justice anthony m kennedys partly concurring and partly 
dissenting opinion 
the majority holds that the county of allegheny violated the 
establishment clause by displaying a creche in the county courthouse 
because the principal or primary effect of the display is to advance 
religion this view of the establishment clause reflects an 
unjustified hostility toward religion a hostility inconsistent with 
our history and our precedents and i dissent from this holding the 
creche display is constitutional and for the same reasons the 
display of a menorah by the city of pittsburgh is permissible as 
well 
obsessive implacable resistance to all but the most carefully 
scripted and secularized forms of accommodation requires this court 
to act as a censor issuing national decrees as to what is orthodox 
and what is not what is orthodox in this context means what is 
secular the only christmas the state can acknowledge is one in 
which references to religion have been held to a minimum the court 
thus lends its assistance to an orwellian rewriting of history as i 
understand it

the inner workings of ptl founder jim 
bakkers televangelism empire will provide the backdrop for the 
federal tax evasion trial of two of his former aides that opens 
wednesday 
brothers david and james taggart are accused of diverting about 
11 million in ptl money to pay their personal expenses including 
55000 for items bought at the exclusive cartier jewelry store in 
new york 
the defendants were known for extravagant purchases and their 
wardrobes included mink coats and designer clothes they bought a 
660000 condominium on fifth avenue in new york and a 317000 home 
in southeast charlotte in 1986 they gave each other jaguars for 
christmas at a cost of nearly 90000 
the taggarts were indicted in december on charges they evaded 
about 494000 in income taxes from 198387 the indictment came out 
the same day that bakker and his former top aide richard dortch 
were indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud 
bakker and dortchs trial on charges of diverting more than 4 
million of ptl money to their own use and conspiring to defraud ptl 
contributors is scheduled to open aug 28 in charlotte however a 
hearing will be held wednesday to decide whether to move their trial 
because of extensive national and local publicity 
us magistrate paul taylor wanted to conduct the hearing behind 
closed doors but several news organizations appealed his decision 
on june 27 a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals in richmond ruled the hearing should be open 
dortch is also trying to get a separate trial taylor may rule on 
that motion wednesday 
the witness list for the taggarts trial looks like a whos 
who of televangelism as justice department attorneys david brown 
and joseph bender may call evangelists jerry falwell john wesley 
fletcher rex humbard and rex humbard jr 
defense attorney ben cottens witnesses could include bakkers 
daughter tammy sue chapman and a former ptl board member the rev 
aimee cortese 
cotten has said he believed the taggarts lifestyles and their 
relationship with bakker would be the focus of the case 
if i were the government i would try to stress that these 
people live high on the hog and now its time to pay the piper 
he told the charlotte observer 
but cotten insisted his clients are innocent 
there never was an intent to do anything he said theres 
no question some taxes may be owed the question is how and why that 
came about thats what this case is going to be about 
prosecutors argue that david taggart 32 who was bakkers 
personal aide and james taggart 35 ptls former interior 
decorator used ptl credit cards to get large cash advances the 
indictment alleged they used the cash to pay personal bills 
prosecutors allege the taggarts also used blank ptl checks to pay 
american express bills and that two of those checks totaled 95000 
during jury selection us district judge robert potter asked 48 
potential jurors more than 80 questions including whether they were 
familiar with brand names such as gucci jaguar cartier and 
mercedesbenz he also asked if they used credit cards checks or 
cash to pay for purchases and if they shopped in fine stores 
if convicted the taggarts each could be sentenced to 30 years in 
prison and face fines totaling 135 million

producers of rabbiteye blueberries are urged to 
be on the lookout for an newly discovered insect friend a bee with 
a long tongue 
the agriculture department said monday that honey bees cant 
pollinate rabbiteye blueberries because their tongues are too short 
but the new bees tongue is longer and can reach into the 
blueberrys flower for nectar 
as it probes the flower with its long tongue the bee also buzzes 
it to loosen a cloud of pollen said jerry a payne an entomologist 
with the departments agricultural research service 
when the bee moves on it carries pollen from one blueberry 
flower to another achieving pollination payne who works at the 
agencys southeastern fruit and tree nut research laboratory byron 
ga said in a report issued here that poor crops of rabbiteye 
blueberries often result from poor cross pollination 
the groundnesting bee habropoda loboriosa was found during a 
threeyear study with auburn university in alabama the bee is 
prevalent in the southeastern united states where rabbiteye 
blueberries are grown on approximately 5000 acres 
payne said the bee which has been named the southeastern 
blueberry bee is larger than a honey bee but smaller than a bumble 
bee the female has a black face minus a creamcolored dot that 
distinguishes the male only the female gathers pollen 
depending on the season consumers pay from 2 to 5 a pint for 
rabbiteye blueberries 
we dont know much about the bees nesting habits payne 
said therefore we dont have any way yet to reintroduce it if 
nests are destroyed so we advice growers not to use insecticides 
when blueberries bloom

the army announced monday it has temporarily 
grounded its entire fleet of ah64 attack helicopters while it 
investigates the cause of a crash in florida last week 
the ah64 apache is the nations newest and most sophisticated 
helicopter gunship the army now has 486 of them in its inventory 
the grounding follows last thursdays crash in northern florida 
of an apache gunship assigned to the florida national guard the 
copilot was killed and the pilot was seriously injured when the 
tail rotor came off the aircraft the army said 
the army said it is analyzing the tail rotor assembly from the 
gunship that crashed in florida the enginering study is expected to 
take several days to complete the service added but could be 
finished in as little as two days 
the apache fleet was last grounded in august 1987 while 
investigators studied the failure of one component of the tail 
rotor the army said monday however it had already ruled out that 
problem as a factor in last weeks crash 
the apache fleet was grounded twice in 1986 both times for 
relatively minor problems 
the apache is replacing the cobra helicopter gunship as the 
armys primary attack helicopter designed to destroy enemy tanks 
the apache is a twinengine copter and is loaded with hellfire and 
hydra 7 missiles and a 30mm cannon 
it is built by mcdonnell douglas helicopters formerly hughes 
helicopters and costs roughly 13 million apiece 
the army said its engineering analysis was being performed at the 
corpus christi texas army depot under the guidance of the us 
army safety center at fort rucker ala 
while the army has acquired 486 apaches to date 94 of those are 
currently out of service because of damage sustained during a freak 
wind storm on may 13 at fort hood texas

the bush administration should set up a weapons 
procurement corps independent of the pentagon to eliminate 
conflicts of interest in defense department buying practices a 
private group study said monday 
the only way to stop the arming of our military with defective 
weapons is to take responsibility for buying those weapons away from 
the military said louis nemeth coauthor of the study by the 
ralph naders center for study of responsive law 
were spending billions of dollars for planes that cant fly 
missiles that cant find their destinations and tanks that cant 
roll nemeth said the pentagon has over and over proven itself 
unwilling or unable to improve our procurement process 
the study cited a number of reasons for the pentagons weapons 
problems including overreliance on new technologies insufficient 
testing of new weapons inadequate competition among contract 
bidders and a revolving door between the pentagon procurement 
system and private defense contractors 
it also blamed members of congress for judging new weapons 
projects on the potential economic payoff for their own state or 
district rather than the actual need for the weapons 
defense secretary dick cheney recently forwarded to president 
bush a package of recommendations for improving management of the 
pentagon including changes in the procurement process details of 
cheneys recommendations have not been made public 
the nader groups study cited numerous weapons systems that have 
been plagued by previously reported problems including the 
midgetman and mx peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles 
the m1 abrams tank the f14 tomcat fighter jet and the bradley 
fighting vehicle it said this formed a pattern of ineffective 
pentagon control of procurement that undermines us security 
among the studys recommended reforms 
establish a procurement corps of weapons experts independent 
of the defense department and the military services to manage all 
phases of weapons system acquisition it would analyze the services 
weapons requests determine when development of new systems was 
needed award production contracts and oversee testing 
increase competitive bidding in part by inviting foreign 
military contractors to participate in design competitions 
end the practice of beginning production of a new weapon system 
before the development stage has been completed

the following is a transcript of 
president bushs written statement in reaction to mondays supreme 
court decision restoring state powers to regulate abortion 
we welcome this decision by upholding the missouri statute the 
court appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability to 
protect the unborn we continue to believe that roe vs wade was 
incorrectly decided and should be reviewed 
americans obviously differ over the difficult issue underlying 
this case the morality and appropriate legal status of abortion 
any decision in this area will stir strong feelings nevertheless i 
have confidence that the american people will continue to express 
their deeply held convictions on this subject within the bounds of 
civility and our legal institutions

secretary of state james 
a baker iii was flying to japan monday intent on keeping 
usjapanese relations on an even keel despite the setbacks 
suffered by the government of prime minister sosuke uno 
talking to reporters while en route here for a refueling stop 
baker said it is important to studiously avoid involving ourselves 
in the internal affairs of the government of japan 
unos liberal democratic party was handed a stinging defeat in 
municipal elections monday and the prime minister has been fighting 
allegations that he kept several paid mistresses uno has denied the 
reports 
baker was asked whether inviting uno to a dinner tuesday evening 
was an attempt to deflect attention from unos problems 
baker indicated that he disagreed with the premise of the 
question 
he said stability in usjapanese relations is important not 
just for the pacific region but for the world as a whole 
during his talks in tokyo baker said he will emphasize the need 
for the worlds two largest economies to form a global 
partnership 
some analysts believe that the accumulation of problems over the 
past month may force uno to resign soon 
the main purpose of bakers visit is to take part in a conference 
of donor nations on a proposed 10 billion fiveyear multilateral 
assistance and investment program for the philippines 
the meeting is being held under the sponsorship of the world bank 
with participation by the european economic community canada 
australia and the united states among others 
the bush administration has asked congress for 200 million as 
the us contribution for the first year 
baker said he strongly supports the multilateral effort arguing 
that the philippines is now on a democratic path and still faces a 
determined communist insurgency 
questioned on another subject baker said he didnt find it 
particularly disturbing that two communists have been named to 
the newly formed cabinet in greece a nato ally 
baker noted that the coalition government in greece has only a 
threemonth life expectancy and that in any case neither of the 
posts occupied by communists deals with defense or foreign policy 
after a day in tokyo baker will fly to brunei where he will meet 
with his colleagues from the sixnation association of southeast 
asian nations 
one goal of that meeting is to try to find ways of avoiding civil 
war in cambodia after vietnamese forces complete their scheduled 
troop withdrawal in september 
after two days in brunei baker heads for poland where he will 
link up with president bush for his fournation european visit 
he has a rest stop of a day and a half in oman en route to poland

the rev george stallings founder of an 
unauthorized new congregation for black catholics is virtually 
assured of being suspended as a priest a roman catholic official 
said monday 
the penalty is given in such cases not for punishment but in 
hopes of reconciliation said the rev william lori secretary to 
cardinal james a hickey archbishop of washington he said he 
thought hickey would act quite soon 
lori said hickey might make a decision by wednesday three days 
after stallings celebrated the first mass of his imani temple 
should stallings be suspended he would lose his right to preach 
celebrate mass or officiate at weddings and funerals lori said 
efforts to reach stallings by telephone for comment were 
unsuccessful 
stallings a convert to catholicism said sunday the church 
cant throw me out and even if they do throw me out i have my own 
opinion they have theirs 
he said he created his congregation because the established roman 
catholic church is not responsive to the cultural and spiritual 
needs of black parishioners 
the church hierarchy is not opposed to stallings efforts only 
the way he is going about them said lori the cardinals secretary 
as catholics we look to the bishop for overall guidance on 
when to establish a new parish lori said we cant have a 
priest setting up a new parish and saying hey we have a better 
product over here 
eileen marks a spokeswoman for the archdiocese said that more 
than 40 parishes in the washington area incorporate elements of the 
africanamerican culture stallings plans to emphasize in his 
services 
the ceremony at his church sunday included traditional catholic 
prayers and liturgy along with elements borrowed from african and 
southern black revival traditions black representatives of other 
faiths including baptists and muslims attended to show support for 
stallings move 
at one point stallings told his congregation we cant wait 
how much longer does the roman catholic church need 
later he said we cant just be sitting on the pew anymore 
weve got to start standing up on the promises 
since stallings announced his plans two weeks ago he has been on 
a collision course with church leaders 
in spite of his claims to the contrary father stallings 
action is a serious step toward separating himself from the roman 
catholic church hickey said recently in a statement 
this situation has more to do with the needs and expectations 
of father stallings than with broader questions about the adequacy 
of catholic ministry within the black community hickey said 
lori said monday suspension is virtually assured 
stallings said last week he had been fired by hickey as 
evangelist for the archdiocese but lori said no official action had 
yet been taken 
if stallings is suspended church officials will continue meeting 
with him in hopes of solving their differences lori said

two public hospitals in missouri will 
stop performing abortions because of mondays supreme court ruling 
and the governor set up a task force to consider further 
restrictions on abortion 
we in missouri will press on to protect the lives of our future 
generations and literally to protect the future of the state gov 
john ashcroft said at a news conference after the court upheld key 
portions of missouris 1986 abortion law 
in its ruling the high court stopped short of overturning its 
1973 roe vs wade decision which barred the states from outlawing 
abortion but it restored missouri regulations that among other 
things prevent the use of public facilities for abortions require 
doctors to determine when possible whether a fetus at least 20 
weeks old is capable of surviving outside the womb and ban the use 
of tax money for encouraging or counseling women to have 
abortions not necessary to save life 
state health officials said only 90 of the 17382 abortions 
performed in missouri last year were performed in two public 
hospitals truman medical center in kansas city and the university 
of missouri hospital and clinics in columbia 
dr james mongan executive director of the 360bed truman 
medical center said the hospital will stop performing abortions 
which in the past have been paid for by the client abortions in 
missouri have not been financed with public money since the mid 
1970s 
mongan said the number of requests for abortions at the hospital 
has dropped over the years because the procedure can be done 
elsewhere umc officials said their physicians will also stop 
performing abortions 
this is a tragedy that will affect mostly lowincome 
women said bj isaacsonjones executive director of 
reproductive health services the private st louis clinic that was 
party to the case i am filled with grief rage and bitter 
disappointment 
rhs would continue to provide all choices to women regardless 
of their ability to pay she said 
the cost of abortions for lowincome women at the private st 
louis clinic is determined on a sliding scale the standard fee for 
firsttrimester abortions is 260 
judith widdicombe founder of the clinic called the decision an 
outrage 
theres a movement in this country that will not tolerate this 
it will become our vietnam of the 1990s she said 
their goal is no abortions widdicombe said next will come 
birth control 
a 30yearold st louis woman who had an abortion earlier this 
year was at the clinic for the announcement of the decision 
this is going to go on and on said the woman who asked that 
her name not be used and the quiet silent majority is going to 
have to speak up every organization thats prochoice is going to 
have to fight a thousand times harder its like dominoes if you 
give up once they keep falling down one by one 
ashcroft said he will form a task force to recommend additional 
measures to protect the health of mothers and protect the lives of 
unborn children by reducing the number of abortions 
i think theres a clear message the pendulum has changed 
direction said lou defeo of the missouri catholic conference 
which helped draft missouris abortion law the court has 
apparently extended the invitation for legislatures across the 
country to further protect human life from its beginning it opens 
new doors 
missouris abortion statute quickly drew a legal attack after it 
passed in 1986 and a federal court blocked its implementation even 
before it took effect 
that was what supporters wanted because the law was passed with 
the intention of making it a vehicle for challenging roe vs wade 
the missouri case drew national attention and a flood of briefs 
for and against abortion poured into the supreme court which heard 
arguments on the issue last april 
the law was the missouri legislatures third effort to restrict 
abortions since the 1973 decision parts of a 1974 law enacted to 
get around roe vs wade were overturned by the supreme court in 
1976 another law requiring that abortions during the fourth to 
sixth months of pregnancy be conducted in hospitals was overturned 
in 1983 
the legislature voted overwhelmingly to pass the latest law 
which included a provision that the life of each human being 
begins at conception the supreme court on monday ruled that 
provision was constitutional 
attorney general william webster who argued the case before the 
supreme court said the decision means substantial prerogative 
will be returned to all 50 states 
it doesnt take us back before roe but it does suggest states 
will have more power than they have had in the past two decades 
said webster a republican

the supreme court on monday agreed to use a 
race discrimination case from north carolina to explore the right to 
a jury trial by those filing civil lawsuits 
the court said it will hear during its next term beginning in 
october an appeal by a machinist who said he was fired because he 
is black a ruling in the case is likely in 1990 
the machinist john s lytle had worked for more than two years 
at the household manufacturing inc plant in arden nc he was 
fired after failing to show up for work on aug 12 1983 
he said he was ill and wanted the day off to see a doctor lytle 
said he planned to work on aug 13 a saturday to make up the 
time but was prevented from telling his supervisor of his plan 
because the supervisor was angry with him over another incident 
lytle then filed a complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission charging his employer with racial bias in 
the firing 
he also said the company in retaliation for his eeoc complaint 
refused to provide him with a letter of recommendation to help him 
get another job 
lytle filed a federal suit under a centuryold civil rights law 
first used to protect freed slaves 
that same law was the center of a heated controversy last month 
when the supreme court reaffirmed the act can be used to charge 
private employers with bias in that same ruling the justices 
limited the law by ruling that the statute cannot be invoked to 
charge onthejob racial harassment 
the case acted on monday involves a different application of the 
law 
lytle was denied a jury trial by a federal judge who in 1986 
ruled that the 19th century law did not offer him a remedy the 
judge then examined lytles complaint under the civil rights act of 
1964 which also forbids onthejob racial discrimination 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1987 that the 
judge was apparently erroneous in barring lytles complaint 
based on the older law 
but the appeals court refused to reinstate lytles suit 
the appeals court said the suit may not be revived because the 
federal judge examined lytles complaint under the 1964 statute and 
ruled there was insufficient evidence to support his bias claim 
the appeals court said the handling of the employment 
discrimination charge under the 19th century law and under the 1964 
act are identical 
where the elements of the two causes of action are the same 
the findings by the trial judge in one preclude the trial of the 
other the appeals court said 
the case is lytle vs household manufacturing 88334

world leaders recalled andrei gromykos toughness and tenacity 
upon word of his death monday but former president richard m nixon 
summed it all up gromyko was above all a survivor in the most 
ruthless sytem in the world 
nixon himself no stranger to crises noted that as soviet 
foreign minister gromyko served leaders as different as josef 
stalin nikita khrushchev leonid brezhnev yuri andropov and 
konstantin chernenko 
while i generally knew him as an adversary i also respected 
him as one of the most tenacious and able diplomats of the 
postworld war ii era nixon said 
gromyko later soviet president died at the age of 79 in the 
soviet union on sunday president mikahil s gorbachev announced the 
death monday in a session of the supreme soviet legislature 
president bush also noted gromykos long service in a statement 
expressing his condolences and those of his wife barbara 
gromykos career paralleled the course of ussoviet relations 
for nearly 50 years bush said mr gromyko knew every us 
president from franklin roosevelt to geroge bush andrei 
gromykos death marks the passing of a generation that witnessed 
many of the most historic events of this century 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar messaged gorbachev 
to express profound sorrow over the death he described gromyko 
as one of the foremost architects of world society after world 
war ii 
the absence of another such global conflict as well as the 
peace and stability enjoyed by his own continent over the past four 
decades owes much to his experience and wisdom the message said 
perez de cuellar arrived in geneva on monday for the 1989 session 
of the un economic and social council 
former british prime ministers ted heath a conservative and 
lord callaghan a laborite harkened back to their experiences with 
gromyko 
he was more notorious perhaps for saying no than for his 
constructive work but in the negotiations which led to the 
successful conclusion of the first test ban treaty in 1963 he 
played a positive part for the next 15 years he pursued the 
same purpose with the consequent decrease in tension between east 
and west said heath who was prime minister from 197074 
he was a good executor of a bad foreign policy that has now 
changed said callaghan who as james callaghan was foreign 
secretary in a labor government from 197476 and prime minister from 
197679 
callaghan called gromyko a very hard man to negotiate with 
he represented soviet foreign policy at a time when it was 
expansionist and dogmatic toward the end of his period especially 
as president he softened and i was astonished when he described me 
as a good friend 
spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez sent a 
message expressing condolences to his soviet counterpart eduard 
shevarndnadze 
abba eban israels foreign minister in 19661974 said on israel 
radio that gromyko no doubt was the high priest of diplomacy he 
was no prophet or reformist and he owed his remarkable survival to 
his ability to adjust to many successful leaders 
recalling the days leading to the november 1947 un decision on 
the partition of palestine eban said 
the image of gromyko is engraved in the memory as a positive 
one 
the surprising day was in april when gromyko rose up at the 
preparatory un meeting and announced that there are two 
possibilites one is a federal state with jewish and arab cantons 
and if there is no agreement on it we should not rule out the 
possibility of dividing the land into two states a jewish one and 
an arab one it changed all the prognoses and for the first time we 
saw a real chance for success 
this was a pleasant surprise because none of us could predict 
this development the assumption was that the stalinist regime was 
antizionist and antijewish in principle 
but eban noted that the main strategic task of the soviet union 
was to drive out the west that was then represented by great 
britain 
and eban also recollected about gromyko 
he had that sorrowful expression it was so characteristic of 
him 
i had said once that he smiled like a blue lamp in a 
refrigerator

the security council on monday postponed a 
scheduled meeting on the israelioccupied territories and diplomats 
said the united states sought to water down criticism of israels 
latest deportations 
the meeting was rescheduled for wednesday at 11 am 
european diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
delay was caused by a us bid to tone down language in a resolution 
on israels expulsion of eight palestinians from deplore to 
regret 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas r pickering 
would not comment on language used in the draft resolution and said 
only we will continue to hold discussions 
other diplomatic sources suggested the united states wanted to 
hold off on the resolution until after israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc meets to consider shamirs 
peace plan shamir has proposed elections in the occupied 
territories to choose arab representatives to negotiate limited 
autonomy with israel 
last week israel deported eight palestinians from the gaza strip 
and west bank to neighboring lebanon saying they were leaders of 
the palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
the united states as one of five permanent members of the 
security council could veto any measure critical of its israeli 
ally last year the united states supported one resolution calling 
on israel not to expel palestinians and it abstained from another 
measure of condemnation 
israel has deported 55 palestinians from the occupied territories 
since the palestinian uprising began 19 months ago at least 538 
palestinians and 23 israelis have been killed in the socalled 
intefadeh for independence from israel 
the proposed resolution sponsored by syria and the arab league 
deplores the deportations by israel it calls upon israel to ensure 
immediate return to the territories of deported palestinians and to 
stop deporting arab civilians 
it cites the geneva convention of 1949 which covers treatment of 
civilians in time of war and prohibits their explusions 
the council members are algeria brazil canada colombia

a sharply divided supreme court on monday 
strictly limited christmas nativity scenes and other religious 
displays on government property banning them if they convey an 
endorsement of religion 
by a 54 vote the justices said a christmas nativity scene 
standing alone inside the allegheny county courthouse in pittsburgh 
violated the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
but by a separate 63 vote the court allowed a hanukkah menorah 
one city block away on the front steps of pittsburghs citycounty 
building 
justice harry a blackmun said the menorah a ninebranched 
candelabra used during the jewish holiday hanukkah was part of a 
display conveying the citys secular recognition of different 
traditions for celebrating the winter holiday season 
the menorah was surrounded by a much taller christmas tree and a 
sign saluting freedom blackmun noted 
by contrast he said the nativity scene or creche carrying 
signs hailing jesus as the son of god gave the impression the 
county was endorsing christian principles 
government may celebrate christmas in some manner and form but 
not in a way that endorses christian doctrine he said here 
allegheny county has transgressed this line 
the important churchstate ruling came on the final day of the 
court term but was overshadowed by a longawaited decision in which 
the court expanded state power to regulate abortions 
the court stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion but agreed to hear three other abortion cases from 
minnesota illinois and ohio when the justices take the bench 
again in october 
in other actions the court 
accepted its firstever right to die case and agreed to 
decide whether a missouri family may order removal of a lifesupport 
system from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition 
agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student 
religious groups be given the same access as other extracurricular 
clubs to public high school facilities the justices will decide 
whether a bible study group must be allowed to meet at an omaha 
neb high school after class hours 
in the religion case the court reaffirmed a test it has used 
since 1971 to determine when the wall between church and state is 
breached 
blackmun was joined in striking down the nativity scene by 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall john paul stevens 
and sandra day oconnor 
justice anthony m kennedy participating in his first 
churchstate case since joining the court in 1988 voted to permit 
the nativity scene he was joined in that dissent by chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white and antonin scalia 
voting to strike down the menorah display were brennan marshall 
and stevens 
thank god for the supreme court said charles saul a 
pittsburgh attorney representing a jewish group that owned the 
menorah the court is saying that when you put a menorah and a 
christmas tree and these kinds of things together that all faiths 
are welcome 
but other jewish groups were less enthusiastic 
sholom d comay president of the american jewish committee said 
we believe that the court erred in permitting the menorah 
display there is simply no religious need for the display of 
sacred symbols of any faith in or at government buildings 
blackmun said the creche violates the constitution because 
nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creches 
religious message 
that message blackmun said is spelled out unmistakably in the 
display 
glory to god in the highest says the angel in the creche 
glory to god because of the birth of jesus he said this 
praise to god in christian terms is indisputably religious indeed 
sectarian 
kennedy said the court in barring goverment sponsorship of the 
creche showed an unjustified hostility toward religion a 
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents 
mondays ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the 
court upheld the constitutionality of a citysponosred creche in 
pawtucket ri that display included various secular symbols 
including santa claus and his reindeer 
lower courts across the nation have been confused about just 
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental 
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional 
promotion or advancement of religion 
most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one 
and have disallowed various displays deemed too religious 
blackmun acknowledged monday that the 1984 ruling is none too 
clear but he said the new ruling may help dispel the confusion 
he said these are the guiding principles the governments use 
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of 
endorsing religious beliefs and the effect of the governments use 
of religious symoblism depends upon its context 
the pittsburgh creche was displayed in the county courthouse from 
1981 to 1987 for about six weeks during the christmas season 
the 18foot menorah was displayed each year from 1982 to 1987 on 
the front steps of the building that houses city and county offices 
it stood next to a 45foot christmas tree 
the american civil liberties union and others went to court 
seeking removal of both

the court monday also split 54 in ruling 
states may ban any public employee doctor nurse or other 
health care provider from performing or assisting most abortions 
states may ban the use of any public hospital or other facility 
for performing most abortions 
a declaration in missouris law that the life of each human 
being begins at conception and that unborn children have 
protectable interests in life health and wellbeing wrongly was 
struck down by the appeals court because it has no legal impact 
on each point chief justice william h rehnquist scalia and 
justices byron r white anthony m kennedy and sandra day oconnor 
joined to form a majority 
there was no one opinion speaking for the five however 
rehnquist wrote the courts main opinion but only white and kennedy 
joined his reasoning on each point 
the court also ruled that a dispute over one missouri provision 
prohibiting the use of tax money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions not necessary to save their lives had 
become moot 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall joined 
blackmuns strongly worded dissent to the overall opinion 
in all the decision yielded five opinions totaling 78 pages the 
authors were rehnquist scalia oconnor blackmun and stevens 
the justices also ensured that abortion will dominate the courts 
198990 term which begins in october by agreeing to review three 
abortion disputes from illinois ohio and minnesota 
in each roe vs wade is under attack 
i fear for the future said blackmun i fear for the 
liberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived and 
come of age in the 16 years since roe was decided 
he added for today the women of this nation still retain the 
liberty to control their destinies but the signs are evident and 
very ominous and a chill wind blows 
rehnquist cited high court abortion rulings since 1973 in 
upholding the bans on using public money public hospitals and 
public employees for abortions 
the constitution does not forbid a state or city from 
expressing a preference for normal childbirth the chief justice 
wrote 
in upholding the missouri provision requiring fetal testing 
rehnquist white and kennedy criticized the trimesterbytrimester 
approach of roe vs wade 
we do not see why the states interest in protecting potential 
human life should come into existence only at the point of 
viability and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowing 
state regulation after viability but prohibiting it before 
viability rehnquist said 
scalia provided a fourth vote to junk the trimester approach but 
oconnor who has criticized that approach in previous abortion 
rulings refused to go along 
although she voted to uphold the missouri fetaltesting 
requirement oconnor said there will be time enough to 
reexamine roe and to do so carefully 
as had been suspected even before mondays ruling oconnor 
clearly will be the key vote in any future abortion ruling 
while missouri officials were preparing their appeal to the 
nations highest court former reagan administration lawyer william 
bradford reynolds suggested that the states appeal include a call 
for the overturning of roe vs wade 
in a brief filed two days after the presidential election last 
nov 8 the reagan administration supported missouris appeal 
the bush administration also backed missouris efforts to restore 
its abortion regulations 
in an attempt to sway the justices americans in record numbers 
wrote and telephoned the court to express their views before the 
april arguments the court was receiving tens of thousands of 
letters each day and the courts two switchboards were so flooded 
with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated 
scalia referred to the public pressure stating we can now 
look forward to at least another term with carts full of mail from 
the public and streets full of demonstrators 
in a more formal form of lobbying the court also received a 
record number of friendofthecourt briefs unsolicited advice 
from individuals and organizations not part of the missouri 
litigation 
in all 78 such briefs were filed

opposition leaders from left and right 
accused mexicos longgoverning institutional revolutionary party on 
monday of committing fraud in state elections that officials 
promised would be clean 
the charges came after the party known as pri in spanish 
claimed victories in four of the five states that held elections for 
new legislatures and mayors sunday 
in baja california which also chose a new governor margarita 
ortega 38 of the pri and ernesto ruffo 37 of the conservative 
national action party both claimed victory 
parties in this border state were basing claims on their own 
counts and projections by law election boards have until july 9 to 
announce official returns 
if he wins ruffo a former mayor of ensenada will become the 
first opposition governor in mexico since the pri was founded and 
took power 60 years ago 
national action leaders in baja california and leaders of the 
leftist democratic revolutionary party running a tight race for the 
state legislature in michoacan complained of balloting irregularies 
the pri has taken the decision to impose itself at whatever 
cost cuauhtemoc cardenas told a news conference monday 
cardenas is the democratic revolutionary leader and a native son 
of michoacan 
pridominated electoral commissions in baja california and 
chihuahua said irregularities existed but denied they were 
important or affected the results in michoacan the pri accused the 
leftist opposition of irregularities 
the opposition complained that ballot boxes were stolen voter 
credentials were burned and voter registration rolls were tampered 
with so many people could not cast ballots when they showed up at 
polling stations 
congressman norberto corrella said he and other national action 
workers spent the night recovering ballot boxes stolen by pri 
workers corella said pri workers stuffed the boxes and planned to 
turn them over to the election commission in mexicali the state 
capital 
we recovered 17 ballot boxes corrella said and complained 
that tampered boxes all of a sudden showed the pri winning 
10to1 he said he filed complaints with the election commission 
and the district attorneys office 
similarly the citizens action committee of human development 
reported 266 irregularities that included multiple voting people 
casting ballots without registration cards and harassment of 
opposition poll watchers at the states 1166 polling places 
the pri said it also won a majority of the state legislatures 19 
seats but gave no figures 
in michoacan the pri said it won in 10 districts and led in 
others and would get a majority of the 24 seats in the state 
legislature 
opposition leaders and many reporters who watched the polls said 
voter registration rolls were altered other documents were tampered 
with and many people were kept from voting 
in elections for mayors in chihuahua where pri said it was 
ahead national action leaders complained that many pri sympathizers 
voted several times and that indelible ink to mark voters fingers 
to prevent fraud either was removed or was not indelible 
the pri claimed victories in its strongholds of campeche and 
zacatecas also electing state legislatures 
reports of turnouts ranged from 30 to 65 percent depending on 
which party was doing the reporting official figures were not 
available 
president carlos salinas de gortari has been promising clean 
elections since he took office dec 1 but national action spokesman 
jesus hernandez in ciudad juarez called this just words 
these elections were dirty he told reporters sunday night 
baja california and michoacan held center stage sunday because 
voters in both states gave salinas onethird or less of their votes 
in july 1988 presidential elections

a fire investigator concluded seven years ago that 
a 10story office building which burned last week killing five 
people was a firetrap officials confirmed monday 
a woman who had been in critical condition since the fire died 
monday at piedmont hospital said sgt steve martin of the fulton 
county medical examiners office 
fire officials said their investigation continues to point to an 
electrical worker who apparently triggered an explosion while 
changing a fuse 
an inspector from the atlanta bureau of fire examined the 
peachtree 25th building in july 1982 and concluded a disaster was 
possible if fire broke out in the sprinklerless building acting 
fire chief tom perrin said monday 
when he conducted his investigation some years back he felt 
like it was a firetrap perrin said he added that at the time the 
investigator now a lieutenant with the fire department did 
stipulate some things that needed to be done 
perrin said the lieutenant reminded him of the 1982 inspection on 
friday hours after the fatal fire at the midtown building 
officials want more information from the lieutenant but he has since 
left on vacation and will not be back for a few days the chief said 
the building apparently underwent some renovations in july 1982 
around the time of the lieutenants inspection but the 
investigative file is inconclusive as to whether the renovations 
would have placed the building under any additional code 
requirements said deputy chief ad bell 
were still looking at how much renovation was conducted at 
that time and that would determine what type of codes would have to 
be abided by bell said once we can determine that we can 
ascertain what should or should not have been done 
american management co of torrance calif which manages the 
peachtree 25th building referred reporters to a representative of 
its atlanta office ken poole who did not return a reporters call 
perrin said investigators were getting close to knowing 
exactly what happened friday and believe the electrical repairman 
was involved when he tried to change a fuse following a power outage 
on that floor where he had inserted the 200amp fuse we feel 
when he inserted that fuse with the current still on thats 
what caused the explosion and thats what caused the fire perrin 
said 
perrin said errors on someones part apparently contributed to 
the fire but declined to elaborate 
the investigation could be finished this week he said 
perrin said firefighters responding to the fire turned in a 
textbook performance in saving people but might have been able to 
work faster if theyd had more help bureau officials estimate that 
atlantas fire department with about 1070 employees is about 105 
short of its minimum needs 
were really strained perrin said we dont have the 
manpower we need for a major city its time to quit playing 
games 
bureau of fire officials have been asking for more manpower for 
about seven years but have been thwarted by budget considerations 
officials said monday 
several of the more than 30 people injured remained hospitalized 
monday

leftist guerrillas attacked a 
military guard post in the capital early monday after they tried and 
failed to ambush a car carrying the nations chief justice 
three people were reported killed and three wounded in the two 
attacks 
an army news release said rebels opened fire with automatic 
weapons and rocketpropelled grenades on the military post guarding 
a san salvador residential suburb southwest of the capital where 
many army officers live 
witnesses said the grenade explosions and rattle of gunfire at 
dawn sent many residents in the arce neighborhood tumbling out of 
their beds they said several officers rushed out of their homes in 
pajamas or shorts assault rifles in hand and helped repel the 
attack 
the army said no military men were hurt and the dead body of a 
guerrilla seen lying across the street from the guard post 
appeared to be the only casualty of the 30minute gun battle 
in a broadcast over their clandestine radio venceremos the 
farabundo marti national liberation front rebels said the attack was 
part of a renewed action against the officers who command the 
salvadoran war 
at estimated 75000 people have been killed since the rebels 
started fighting for power in october 1979 
on sunday supreme court chief justice mauricio gutierrez castro 
said another group of rebels tried but failed to ambush him and his 
family as they drove back from a day at a beach near the port of la 
libertad 
gutierrez told a television news show monday morning he was 
grazed by a bullet in the neck but that one of several bodyguards 
riding in a second car behind the family was killed and another was 
wounded 
authorities said a woman driving a car on the same road also was 
killed and a male companion was wounded during the attempted ambush 
about 10 miles south of the capital 
gutierrez said his bodyguards opened fire when they saw the 
rebels had blocked the road with a parked bus and the guerrillas 
returned the fire he said his driver made a quick uturn and sped 
away from the fighting 
i dont think it was an attack on me personally as they had no 
way of knowing i would be traveling on that road gutierrez said 
president alfredo cristiani named gutierrez a conservative 
chief justice last week cristiani was sworn in june 1 after being 
elected on the rightist republican nationalist alliance ticket 
gunmen in june killed antonio rodriguez porth cristianis chief 
of staff and several others were slain later in similar attacks 
the government has blamed the guerrillas for the assassinations but 
the rebels have denied responsibility

the supreme court said monday it will take up 
three more abortion cases next term providing ample opportunity for 
further adjustments in the law 
the cases from illinois ohio and minnesota will be heard by 
the court after the 198990 term begins early in october 
mondays decision freed states to impose restrictions on a 
womans right to abortion but stopped short of reversing the 
courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
i think its going to go down randall terry president of 
the antiabortion group operation rescue said of the 1973 
precedent antiabortion groups hope hes right 
solicitor general kenneth starr said it was too soon to determine 
whether the bush administration would seek to intevene in next 
falls cases the administration supported missouri in defense of 
the state regulations largely upheld monday 
the illinois case clearly poses the largest direct threat to roe 
vs wade the 16yearold ruling it would be extremely difficult 
for the court to revive the illinois laws in question without 
substantially dismantling its 1973 decision 
the illinois cse stems from that states attempt to enforce 
extensive regulations on abortion clinics 
lower courts said three illinois laws when applied to abortion 
clinics impermissibly interfered with womens abortion rights 
a federal trial judge and the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
said the regulations imposed by the illinois laws would have forced 
abortion clinics to become the functional equivalent of small 
hospitals for no valid purpose 
the three laws the medical practice act the ambulatory 
surgical treatment center act and the health facilities providers 
act generally apply to all medical centers where outpatient 
surgery is performed 
the regulations covered staffing and equipment requirements and 
even the size of the facility 
one regulation required patient counseling that included a 
discussion of alternatives description of the procedure to be 
performed and an explanation of risks and possible complications 
the ohio abortion law generally required doctors to notify a 
parent of young unmarried girls before performing abortions 
lower courts said the law impermissibly interfered with some 
girls constitutional right to seek an abortion 
passed by the states legislature in 1985 the ohio law never 
took effect due to a successful legal challenge by an akron abortion 
clinic and one of its doctors 
the law would have required any doctor asked to perform an 
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girls 
parents at least 24 hours before the operation 
doctors could satisfy the laws notification requirement by 
telling the girls brother or sister if over 21 or a designated 
stepparent or grandparent 
young girls could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking 
the permission of a state judge to have an abortion 
among other flaws found by the lower courts was the fact that 
ohio had made no showing that its interest in protecting immature 
minors is advanced by requiring the attending physician as opposed 
to another qualified responsible person to do the notifying 
the minnesota law at issue requires some girls to tell both 
parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion it was upheld 
by a federal appeals court 
the minnesota legislature passed a law in 1981 requiring 
unmarried girls under 18 and still living with a parent to provide 
written notice to both parents if possible before obtaining an 
abortion 
the law also imposed a 48hour waiting period and made doctors 
who perform abortions criminally liable for violations 
after a judge blocked enforcement of the law a judicial bypass 
option took effect it allowed girls to avoid notifying their 
parents by convincing a judge they were mature and capable of 
giving informed consent or that an abortion without notice to both 
parents would serve the girls best interest 
the notification law with the judicial bypass option was in 
effect in minnesota for five years before a federal judge ruled that 
it was unconstitutional 
the law had been challenged in behalf of minors a parent four 
abortion clinics and two doctors 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld that ruling but the entire appeals court last aug 8 upheld 
the law by a 73 vote 
the 8th circuit court postponed the effect of its ruling so 
opponents of the law could seek supreme court review 
the high court previously has upheld a states parental 
notification law but it never before has handled a case involving 
such a law that had been in effect

antiabortion lawmakers seized the us supreme courts abortion 
ruling monday as a blueprint for restrictions in their states and 
advocates on both sides predicted the debate would turn their 
legislatures into battlefields 
i would expect warfare said rep arthur m read ii a rhode 
island republican who is state house minority whip there are two 
irreconcilable positions that are very strongly held 
its going to be the same old fight but more intense said 
sen ben vidricksen a kansas republican in fact its going to 
be a bloody battle in the legislature 
in michigan republican sen jack welborn said he already has 
drafted a law based on the missouri abortion statute that the 
supreme court largely upheld from new york to alabama to the west 
other legislators had similar plans 
while the high court left a womans basic right to abortion 
intact we can go a hell of a lot further in restricting 
abortions said rep stephen freind a pennsylvania republican and 
a leading abortion foe in his state 
the righttolife philosophy has been on the defensive since 
roe vs wade the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion said sen tom 
rasmussen a montana republican this gives us greater impetus to 
go on the offensive 
with most legislatures in recess few if any laws appeared likely 
to change immediately florida house speaker tom gustafson a 
democrat has suggested a special session in tallahassee to take up 
the issue freind in pennslyvania abandoned that idea for fear of 
alienating his vacationing colleagues 
while lawmakers around the country said their legislatures 
undoubtedly will consider the issue many said the outcome is 
unclear montanas sen rasmussen gave new abortion restrictions 
only a 5050 chance in his state 
the state attorney general in neighboring idaho predicted tougher 
abortion laws will be enacted there as a result of the ruling 
lawmakers in wyoming made the same prediction there does appear 
to be a righttolife majority in the legislature said republican 
sen charles scott i suspect there will be a move to do whatever 
the supreme court will allow 
in iowa however i doubt that we will be passing any 
restrictions said democratic house speaker don avenson a 
candidate for governor we will be very cautious about even 
thinking of restricting womens reproductive rights 
the court upheld bans on any public employee performing or 
assisting in abortions not neccessary to save the mothers life and 
on the use of any public hospital or other facility in such 
abortions 
it also said the states may ban the use of tax money for 
encouraging or counseling women to have abortions not necessary 
to save their lives and may require doctors to determine when 
possible whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old can live outside the 
womb 
sarah weddington a texas attorney who successfully argued the 
roe vs wade case in 1973 noted that the decision will have no 
practical implication until state legislatures pass new laws 
in terms of abortions legal status in each state tomorrow 
its going to be the same as today she said but what we are 
going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative activity in all of 
the state legislatures 
one piece of legislation outlined by an ohio legislator monday 
took the opposite tack from the abortion restrictions proposed 
elsewhere rep joan lawrence a republican said she would 
introduce a law assuring women the right to an abortion before their 
25th week of pregnancy 
the government has no business getting into the business of 
deciding whether a woman should termiate a pregnancy she said 
but if they want us to regulate this is the regulation 
in some states new restrictions face even more powerful 
opponents maine gov john r mckernan jr decried the ruling as a 
setback for abortion rights and said he would fight any effort to 
adopt restrictions in his state 
gov steve cowper of alaska said changes were unlikely given 
alaskans highly developed sense of privacy and maryland senate 
president thomas v miller saw little chance for tougher abortion 
laws there given the makeup of the legislature any attempt to 
change the law in maryland will be an exercise in futility he 
said 
while lawmakers in many states are expected to consider local 
versions of the missouri law activists said some may be presented 
with far more sweeping restrictions intended as further challenges 
to legal abortion 
not only will alabama introduce bills that will bring alabama 
into a more conservative mode with regards to abortion i believe 
youll see every state in america introducing legislation like 
this said republican rep greg beers of birmingham i believe 
the next 12 months will be a very tumultuous time in state 
legislatures

the international coffee organization monday 
suspended all export limits foreshadowing a drop in coffee prices 
worldwide 
the 74nation organization approved a twoyear extension of the 
current agreement minus the quotas limits were suspended as of 
midnight monday 
members earlier rejected two proposals for a new agreement to 
succeed the 6yearold pact that expires sept 30 both failed 
proposals would have retained quotas to stabilize coffee prices 
its a free market and all the surplus will now be available 
for consumers said nestor osorio who headed colombias 
delegation to the oneday emergency meeting he indicated that south 
american and central american coffee producers are sitting on large 
stockpiles 
the united states the most powerful consumer nation and 
11nation group of mild arabica producers took a hard line against 
quotas the united states wanted lower consumer prices and the 
central american nations wanted a larger market share 
the united states was very determined not to have an 
agreement osorio said 
the international coffee organization established in 1963 tries 
to stabilize coffee prices by limiting sales of green coffee beans 
by the producers to the consumers the organization suspended quotas 
twice before first for 19 months in 198687 and then for six years 
in the 1970s 
the limits keep surplus coffee from world markets and maintain 
the average world price above the target minimum of 120 per pound 
the lifting of quotas could cost coffee producers who currently 
earn about 10 billion annually up to 2 billion in lost revenues 
said west german negotiator hugo roerig coffee is a main 
exportearner for dozens of countries and in uganda and other 
african nations it accounts for up to 90 percent of sales abroad 
the market fell dramatically before the coffee organization 
announced its decision and traders said it would likely collapse 
further when trading opens tuesday nearly 10 percent was knocked 
off the price of coffee on the london market 
the organization failed to agree on two proposals that would have 
left the door open to continuing the present pricesupport regime 
one proposal would have extended the existing agreement as is 
with no change in quotas the other called for extension with 
changes that would increase the availability of mild arabica coffees 
one of the most popular varieties 
the suspension of quotas was part of a fallback package drawn up 
last week by the coffee organizations 16nation executive board in 
case an extension was not adopted 
delegates said this means a free market until at least september 
1991 unless a completely new accord is negotiated and enters into 
force before then

the sailor who said the navy tried to 
make him a scapegoat in the blast that killed 47 men aboard the 
battleship iowa charged monday that drug use was widespread on the 
ship 
gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt also accused the navy of 
having a motive of the week in its investigation of the 
explosion and he and his wife and their parents complained of 
harassment by the navy and the news media 
truitt said drug users aboard the iowa included sailors who 
worked in the 16inch gun turret where the explosion occurred 
truitt also worked in the turret 
on the iowa a lot of the guys with us had serious drug 
problems ts pretty bad when your guys are dealing with gunpowder 
and half of the individuals are doing drugs truitt said at a news 
conference 
the sailor said his friend gunners mate clayton hartwig who 
was killed in the april 19 explosion had informed the naval 
investigative services of drug use by other seamen while stationed 
at the navys base at guantanamo cuba truitt said he had talked to 
an officer aboard the iowa about the problem 
he said the two men were among the few in the turret who did not 
use drugs 
a navy spokeswoman with the atlantic fleet public affairs office 
in norfolk va said she could not comment on the druguse 
allegations or any of the statements made by truitt of his family 
its a navy policy not to comment until an investigation is 
completed chief petty officer glenna houston said 
also at the news conference truitts attorney ellis rubin 
again demanded that the navy formally apologize for smearing 
truitts name by leaking false allegations that he was under 
investigation in connection with the iowa blast 
rubin said last week that two nis agents had apologized to truitt 
and he demanded the navy officially clear truitt and tell the public 
he was not homosexual and was not involved in a murdersuicide pact 
that resulted in the explosion 
published reports earlier said that the navy was investigating 
the relationship between truitt and hartwig and the possibility of a 
suicide or murder pact between the two sailors truitt was the sole 
beneficiary on hartwigs doubleindemnity life insurance policy 
the attorney also said he was considering legal action against 
the news media which published and broadcast the leaked information 
there are so many things in this investigation that are untrue 
that it is ridiculous truitt said adding that most of the leaks 
had been debunked 
truitt was accompanied by his wife carole his mother charlotte 
truitt and his wifes parents ray and micki smith 
truitts wife said navy investigators last week extensively 
questioned her about her sex life including whether of not she had 
ever been involved in a menage a trois or whether she had sex with 
hartwig 
she said she wanted an apology from president bush 
truitt was reassigned to the mayport naval station in june

a federal court on monday ordered 
the defense ministry to explain why a former junta member sentenced 
to life in prison for human rights abuses was seen walking in the 
city last week 
defense minister horacio jaunarena said sunday that former navy 
chief emilio massera 63 was given permission to leave magdalena 
military prison to be treated for a liver ailment at the naval 
hospital in the capital 60 miles away 
but a photographer spotted massera on friday outside a building 
about 60 blocks from the hospital the newspaper nuevo sur published 
the pictures on page one saturday 
massera a member of the junta that ousted president isabel peron 
in march 1976 was convicted in december 1985 of human rights abuses 
under the military dictatorship 
security forces arrested at least 8960 purported leftists who 
then vanished and are presumed to have been killed 
a civilian government ended military rule in december 1983 
the massera incident caused an outcry 
attorney eduardo barcesat a member of the argentine league for 
the rights of man called it an affront to civilian rule and shows 
the military is mocking justice 
hernan patino mayer a military adviser to presidentelect carlos 
menem said i knew the outgoing government had lost control of 
the situation but i didnt think it had gone so far menem 
elected on may 14 is to take office on saturday succeeding 
president raul alfonsin 
justice ministerdesignate julio oyhanarte said if it is 
confirmed that massera was released from prison on his own 
recognizance that would be really scandalous 
civilian courts sentenced massera and six other officers for 
human rights offenses before alfonsin sensing military unrest 
pushed through congress a partial amnesty that sheltered about 1100 
others from prosecution 
the army staged insurrections in april 1987 and january and 
december 1988 to force trials to end three admirals and 15 generals 
still face prosecution 
menem says he will act quickly on the issue but gives no 
specifics he and his aides indicated he favors calling off the 
trials and possibly pardoning officers already convicted

the supreme court decision monday reinstating 
key provisions of a missouri abortion law yielded five separate 
opinions 78 pages in all 
the five basic votes in the majority came from chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices sandra day oconnor antonin 
scalia byron r white and anthony m kennedy the four basic 
dissenting votes were cast by justices harry a blackmun john paul 
stevens thurgood marshall and william brennan 
rehnquist oconnor scalia blackmun and stevens filed written 
opinions 
here is a breakdown of the significant votes in the case 
the court ruled unanimously that the missouri provision banning 
the use of tax money for encouraging or counseling women to have 
abortions not necessary to save life has become moot 
the court voted 54 that missouri and other states as well may 
ban abortions in public hospitals or by public employees 
the majority consisted of rehnquist oconnor scalia white and 
kennedy the minority included blackmun marshall brennan and 
stevens 
by a 54 vote the court upheld the missouri provision that 
doctors may have to determine whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old 
is capable of surviving outside the womb by determining lung 
maturity and other testing 
oconnors reasons differed from the other four 
by a 54 vote the court ruled that part of the missouri law 
declaring that the life of each human being begins at conception 
and that unborn children have protectable interests in life 
health and wellbeing is not a live controversy because the 
declaration has no legal impact stevens blackmun marshall and 
brennan dissented 
four justices rehnquist white kennedy and scalia voiced 
support for scrapping the trimesterbytrimester approach in roe vs 
wade only scalia called for the outright reversal of roe vs wade

west germany said monday that 
chancellor helmut kohl has dropped any plans to visit poland this 
month and obstacles persist in talks aimed at binding up wounds 
between the two countries 
the two nations have been negotiating for six months on west 
german economic aid in exchange for polish recognition of its german 
minority 
it is believed the polish government is not satisfied with the 
amount of economic aid not disclosed that has been offered by 
the west germans poland is in an economic crisis 
a final agreement and a visit by kohl would be a symbolic boost 
toward patching up bad feelings that predate nazi germanys 1939 
invasion of poland 
but chief government spokesman hans klein said kohl no longer is 
thinking about going to poland this month 
klein on monday cited questions remaining in the negotiations 
and a changing political scene in poland 
he said a visit this year cannot be excluded but acknowledged no 
definite date has been set for that or for the next round of 
negotiations 
the last round recessed on june 26 
klein said a kohl visit should not be put under any pressures 
of time 
he also said kohl believes it will be in the best interests of 
both sides to wait and see what changes will result in poland 
because of the changing political scene there 
the solidarity trade union has been scoring major political gains 
in poland at the expense of the governing communist party 
klein told reporters that bonn solidly supports reforms under way 
in poland 
the chancellor has underlined his great interest in supporting 
the polish reform process klein said 
lack of movement in polish relations has been a nagging foreign 
policy disappointment for kohls coalition government the coalition 
has built on earlier agreements with other east european countries 
and considerably expanded its political economic and cultural ties 
in the region 
west german officials want more recognition of ethnic germans in 
poland including teaching of german language in schools 
polish officials said they agreed to bonns conditions but 
disagreement remains on the issue of economic assistance

space shuttle columbia fresh out of 
a threeyear remodeling job was rolled closer to the launch pad 
monday for final touches before carrying a secret pentagon payload 
into space 
the national aeronautics and space administration is hoping for a 
july 31 launch but some space agency officials believe liftoff will 
be delayed until early august because flight preparations have taken 
longer than expected 
columbia last flew jan 10 1986 the last mission before sister 
ship challenger exploded and the shuttle fleet was grounded 
in another development monday investigators confirmed reports 
that a bad turbopump bearing caused a shuttle engine to shut down 
prematurely and catch fire during a june 23 test at nasas stennis 
space center in bay st louis miss 
the incident is not expected to affect columbias launch because 
the test involved a developmental engine not flight hardware said 
armis l worlund chief investigator for a team of experts at the 
rocketdyne division of shuttle maker rockwell international corp in 
canoga park calif which dismantled and inspected the engine last 
weekend 
the turbopump circulates liquid oxygen through the shuttles fuel 
lines before launch keeping them ready for main engine ignition 
nasa has had trouble with other turbopumps before one carrying 
liquid hydrogen shorted out during a launch countdown last april 
forcing a oneweek delay in the flight of shuttle atlantis 
at the cape workers joined by four of the five astronauts who 
will fly columbia towed americas oldest orbiter into the huge 
assembly building at dawn monday 
columbia a source of spare parts for sister ships since 1986 
will be hoisted into a noseup position and mated with its fuel tank 
and twin booster rockets final preparations for the trip to the 
launch pad are expected to take seven to 10 days

a former monkey handler at a research lab 
sued the company alleging he was not told that many of the animals 
carry a deadly virus until after it killed a coworker 
terrence young said in a complaint filed in us district court 
on friday that unsafe working conditions at international research 
and development corp of mattawan may have exposed him to the herpes 
b virus 
the virus is found in more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys a 
type of macaque which are used in many laboratory experiments the 
virus is relatively harmless to the animals but has an estimated 70 
percent mortality rate among humans once symptoms appear 
herpes b commonly is transmitted through bites and scratches 
only about 30 cases of human infection have been documented in the 
last 57 years 
young was employed at the company from april 28 to may 28 he 
alleges in the complaint that he often was bitten and scratched 
while handling monkeys 
on one occasion a monkey bit him so hard that a tooth penetrated 
his thumbnail and went completely through his thumb young said he 
said he was treated by a staff nurse who told him the wound was 
nothing to worry about 
young also said protective gear for monkey handlers was 
inadequate including leather gloves with holes in them and a body 
suit that was neither bite nor punctureproof 
about a month after he quit young was given company forms 
detailing the hazards of working with monkeys and the proper 
procedure for caring for monkey bites and scratches the complaint 
said 
company officials didnt return telephone calls monday seeking 
comment but have said in the past that every new employee is warned 
of the virus before handling the monkeys 
youngs coworker thomas mcgeorge 23 died of the virus june 20 
and another coworker who quit after one week at the company has 
been diagnosed with the virus and has been hospitalized since late 
june 
young said he has been informed he also may have been exposed and 
has been given a prescription for an antiviral drug 
other current and former employees of the company also have said 
they werent told about the potential risks associated with handling 
the monkeys until after mcgeorge was diagnosed 
michigan department of public health officials are awaiting 
results from blood tests on about 50 current and former company 
employees 
young is asking for at least 10000 in damages and for pain and 
suffering alleging he lives in continual fear 
in addition to allegations of failing to maintain a safe 
workplace intentional infliction of emotional distress breach of 
implied contract general negligence and misrepresentation the 
lawsuit also alleges the company violated the michigan occupational 
safety and health act and the federal occupational safety and health 
act

a moderate earthquake struck an 
unpopulated region of northern utah on monday afternoon but no 
injuries or damage were reported authorities said 
the quake measured 45 on the richter scale and was centered 11 
miles west of this town in the blue spring hills said jim pechmann 
of the university of utah seismology center 
a june 21 temblor measuring 37 occurred in the same area june 
21 pechmann said 
mondays quake was felt in box elder and salt lake counties 
pechmann said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable damage

pete roses lawsuit against baseball 
commissioner a bartlett giamatti was moved into federal court 
monday but it may be sent right back to state court 
acting on a motion by baseballs lawyers us district judges 
carl b rubin and herman j weber said the court was accepting the 
case because technical requirements had been met even though there 
was substantial doubt the lawsuit should be in federal court 
because rose is closely indentified with the cincinnati reds and 
cincinnati the judges said the case would be moved to federal court 
in columbus ohio where it was assigned to us district judge john 
d holschuh 
rose attorney reuven j katz said papers would be filed wednesday 
with holschuh asking that the case be sent back to state court 
we do not believe there is any merit to baseballs motion 
katz said judge norbert a nadel of the hamilton county court of 
commons pleas issued a temporary restraining order june 25 that 
prevented giamatti from holding a hearing on gambling allegations 
against the cincinnati manager rose claims that giamatti has 
prejudged the accusations against him 
the restraining order is good for 14 days and nadel has scheduled 
a hearing for thursday on roses request for a preliminary 
injunction that would indefinitely put off giamattis hearing 
nadels hearing can take place only if the lawsuit is sent back to 
state court 
baseball appealed the restraining order but a threejudge panel 
of the 1st ohio district court of appeals ruled that it had no 
authority to hear appeals of temporary orders 
louis l hoynes jr baseballs lead lawyer said monday that any 
challenge to the commissioner should be decided in federal court 
the commissioners powers traditionally have been reviwed by 
federal court hoynes said federal court is a more appropriate 
forum 
katz however disagreed 
its not at all unexpected he said its one of the 
alternatives that they had 
the whole thing now is put on hold katz continued it was 
put on hold by their appeal now its put on hold by their attempt 
to remove it to federal court 
rubin the chief judge among the three federal judges in 
cincinnati is at the center of the dispute on april 18 giamatti 
sent a letter to rubin saying that ronald peters one of roses 
accusors has been candid forthright and truthful with baseball 
investigators and provided critical sworn testimony about mr rose 
and his associates 
rubin who was to sentence peters criticized baseball and said 
he believed giamatti was conducting a vendetta against rose rubin 
later removed himself from peters case and that of thomas p 
gioiosa another former associate of the reds manager

heavy artillery exchanges broke out 
between syrian and christian forces in beirut monday night after 
syrias militia allies said they will lift a land blockade of the 
christians as a goodwill gesture 
police said it was not clear what triggered the barrages hours 
after the announcement in damascus syrias capital that the 
15weekold land blockade of the christian sector would be lifted at 
noon tuesday 
police said shellfire pounded residential districts in christian 
east beirut and the western moslem sector but they had no immediate 
word on casualties 
in baghdad iraq president saddam hussein told arab league 
envoys monday peace will not come to lebanon until all foreign 
forces including the syrians withdraw informed official sources 
there reported 
syrians and christians engaged in artillery clashes and warring 
shiite moslem factions in west beirut had a second day of gunbattles 
justice minister nabih berri leader of the shiite amal militia 
said roads into the 310squaremile christian enclave would reopen 
tuesday to all people including crossings on beiruts dividing 
green line and the airport 
but berri said after he and five other syrianbacked moslem 
militia leaders met syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa that a 
blockade of christian ports would remain to stop arms supplies 
getting through 
the christian enclave north of beirut has been besieged since 
march 14 
the airport in beiruts moslem section has been closed since 
fighting began between syrians and christians on march 8 
mondays move appeared to be a guarded syrian response to an 
offer sunday by iraq syrias main arab rival to stop arms 
shipments to the christians if the syrians withdraw from lebanon 
iraqs hussein called for an end to outside interference in 
lebanese affairs when he met monday with the foreign ministers of 
algeria morocco and saudi arabia the official iraqi news agency 
reported 
hussein said he believes all foreign forces in lebanon should 
pull out syria has 40000 troops deployed there the israelis also 
occupy a border strip in south lebanon and iran has about 2000 
revolutionary guards in east lebanon 
iraq supports lebanons christians and moved to aid them after 
the aug 20 ceasefire in the eightyear iraniraq war syria backed 
iran in that conflict 
the three arab ministers are seeking to get syria and iraq to 
stop supporting their warring lebanese allies to end the latest 
flareup in the countrys 14yearold civil war the 22member arab 
league has asked leaders of algeria morocco and saudi arabia to 
settle lebanons crisis by november 
berri spokesman for the sixgroup lebanese national front said 
maintaining the sea blockade is still necessary to prevent the 
arrival of weapons and means of destruction 
that indicated syrian forces and their allies will continue 
shelling the christian coastline as they have done each day for 
nearly four months 
the situation of the ports will remain unchanged until the 
christian leader gen michel aoun lifts his blockade of

a leading opposition theorist monday 
proposed that solidarity support a communist candidate for president 
in exchange for a solidarity candidate becoming prime minister and 
forming the next government 
the proposal by historianessayist adam michnik in a frontpage 
column in the oppositions election gazette drew no immediate 
response from communist party officials who have failed to name a 
presidential candidate to succeed gen wojciech jaruzelski 
also monday the white house reported president bush urged the 
kremlin to withdraw its troops from poland 
the white house released the text of bushs interview with polish 
reporters whom he told friday very candidly id like to see 
soviet troops out i would like to see them start withdrawing 
troops from poland because i think there is no danger at all of an 
invasion of poland from the west bush is to visit warsaw on 
sunday 
polands pap state news agency said the military council of 
generals who oversee the armed forces held an extraordinary meeting 
to discuss the armys position after a party plenum failed to name a 
presidential candidate 
in an apparent indirect endorsement of jaruzelski the council 
said it expects the chairman of the state defense committee and 
the chief of the army to be a person of proper competence and giving 
constitutional guarantees for the safe development of the country 
it stressed the significance of strengthening of polands 
international position within the warsaw pact 
the next president will have charge of the military and the 
other candidate mentioned for the post interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak has no foreign policy experience 
about 200 people demonstrated against jaruzelski outside 
parliament monday and a small group of youths later hurled tear gas 
and threw stones at police no one was reported injured 
jaruzelski must go and soviets go home chanted 
protesters from the banned confederation for an independent poland 
they also opposed the candidacy of kiszczak jaruzelskis longtime 
associate 
the polish leader declared friday he is too closely linked with 
the 1981 martial law crack down on solidarity to lead the country 
during an era of reconciliation 
the communist party has asked him to reconsider however and 
party consultations continued monday to try to persuade him 
with solidaritys support evidenced by overwhelming victories in 
parliamentary voting and growing independence shown by the two 
parties allied with the communists it does not appear that internal 
discipline is strong enough to translate the communists 300259 
national assembly majority into a sure victory for jaruzelski 
the assembly composed of the existing sejm and a new freely 
elected senate is to convene for the first time tuesday a vote on 
the presidency is expected thursday 
solidarity legislators say they will not vote for jaruzelski 
though a formal decision was postponed until wednesday 
poland needs now a strong and trustworthy arrangement of 
authority michnik wrote no facadelike changes are sufficient 
discussing the personal advantages of generals jaruzelski and 
kiszczak is a false road he wrote what is needed is a new 
arrangement that can be accepted by all main political forces 
he suggested a communist party candidate become president and a 
solidarity candidate become prime minister under polands revised 
constitution the president has charge of the army and foreign 
affairs and the prime minister names the cabinet 
walesa previously has rejected suggestions the independent 
movement become part of a governing coalition insisting it remain 
an opposition force 
but michnik who is close to walesa said his plan is the only 
way to practice the postulate of a grand coalition and receive 
western help to rebuild polands economy 
the government negotiated political and economic freedoms with 
the opposition after realizing it could not control social unrest or 
end polands financial plight 
the atmosphere of reform has attracted western interest in 
renewing aid and investment cut off since martial law

president bush has challenged the 
soviet union to withdraw all its troops from poland and take 
advantage of an historic opportunity to help end the postwar 
division in europe 
bush who visits poland on sunday on his way to the sevennation 
economic summit in paris made the proposal in an interview with a 
group of polish reporters last friday in the white house the 
transcript was released monday by bushs vacation white house 
the soviets should withdraw their troops from poland because 
there is no danger at all of an invasion of poland from the 
west bush asserted it was the first time the president called 
for a total soviet withdrawal of troops from poland 
bush here for an extended independence day holiday issued a 
statement monday welcoming the supreme court decision restricting 
womens right to end pregnancies 
by upholding the missouri statute the court appears to have 
begun to restore to the people the ability to protect the unborn 
he said 
bush has voiced support for a constitutional amendment to 
overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized abortions 
chief of staff john sununu told a white house briefing the president 
would continue to actively support such an amendment 
earlier the president voiced condolences to the family of the 
late soviet president andrei a gromyko saying his death marks 
the passing of a generation that witnessed many of the most historic 
events of this century 
bush boated jogged and played golf for the third day in a row as 
he continued to enjoy a fiveday july fourth holiday 
he also mounted a 20000 fireworks display for his neighbors 
monday evening from his sixacre compound on a point jutting out 
into the atlantic ocean 
thousands of people lined the shore to watch the 15minute 
display with more in hundreds of small boats in nearby waters 
the fireworks produced by zambelli international of new castle 
pa the same company that did the 1986 statue of liberty fireworks 
in new york habor were paid for by an anonymous donor white house 
aides said 
poland is bushs first stop on a trip that will also include 
visits to hungary france and the netherlands he arrives in warsaw 
on sunday and will remain in poland through tuesday 
bush in the interview with polish reporters said he was not 
seeking to inflame the situation in poland or do anything that 
is going to cause a crisis 
but he said that when he visits poland next im going to feel 
free to speak out about what we hold dear and what polish 
americans think and what we want to see about a freer a more whole 
europe 
the challenge of soviet troop withdrawal builds on the plan he 
proposed last month while attending a nato summit in brussels that 
called for reducing nato and warsaw pact forces in europe to no more 
than 275000 apiece 
very candidly id would like to see soviet troops out 
bush said in his interview with reporters for three polish news 
organizations 
the soviet union currently maintains 40000 troops in poland 
according to the londonbased institute of international and 
strategic studies 
bush conceded it was probably unrealistic to envision a complete 
withdrawal of all soviet forces in eastern europe as long as we 
have this tremendous disparity in sovietdeployed troops 
he said however poland would be a good place for the soviets to 
start 
in poland theres an historic opportunity now to help end the 
postwar division of europe bush said 
he said he hopes to carry through on a package of economic aid to 
poland as a reward for its recent steps toward democracy but bush 
told the polish reporters we need to know that youre going to be 
able to not only continue existing reforms but expand on reforms so 
that the economic system that works will be given a chance to work 
unfettered 
bush said that he wasnt going to be naive in suggesting that 
we have no differences with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev on the 
future of divided europe 
it doesnt bother me as president of the united states that he 
gorbachev gets a good standing on the applause meters over there 
in europe western europe bush continued nor should it bother 
him when i take my message of freedom and democracy to eastern 
europe

abe stolar is coming home for his first fourth of 
july in america in 58 years both he and the city have changed since 
1931 when dreams of a soviet workers paradise inspired a journey 
into disenchantment 
since leaving his west side neighborhood at 19 stolar lost his 
father during the stalinist purges his mother and sister to camps 
in siberia and the sight in one eye to a german hand grenade 
a chicagoborn us citizen he served in the red army during 
world war ii then worked as a translator and announcer for radio 
moscow even after nearly six decades in the soviet union however 
his accent is pure west side 
after a 14year fight to emigrate stolar 77 left the soviet 
union for israel in march with his wife son daughterinlaw and 
two grandchildren 
hes a very up person no matter whats happening i think 
that has helped him stay healthy i think that has helped him stay

is financing and arranging his visit

chicago the first stop wednesday on a 12city tour by stolar and 
his wife gita rozovskaya that covers both coasts they also will 
visit anchorage alaska and miami before winding up with an aug 13 
trip to los angeles 
stolars hometown has changed 
his memory of chicago is just frozen in time in 1931 said 
david carle a spokesman for sen paul simon dill who helped 
draw attention to stolars efforts to leave the soviet union 
it will be a new look at the old town which will really be all 
new to me stolar said in a letter to simons staff 
the depression is over the skyline is taller marked with new 
silhouettes humboldt park a workingclass neighborhood of mostly 
eastern european jewish immigrants in the 1930s is largely 
hispanic tuley high school his alma mater has been replaced by 
roberto clemente high 
but wrigley field looks much the same and the recent addition of 
lights at the venerable ballpark will make it possible for him to 
catch wednesdays night game between the cubs and the san diego 
padres 
stolar dreamed of one day staying in the posh 3000room stevens 
hotel a dream that will come true 
the hotel now the conrad hilton and towers has offered the 
stolars its 23rdfloor chicago suite despite recent refurbishing 
the grand ballroom and grand salon glittering with mirrors and 
gold leaf are virtually unchanged said assistant manager peter 
borup 
no special menu is planned during stolars weeklong stay hes 
a junkfood junkie who likes hamburgers and hot dogs borup said 
stolar plans meetings with old friends throughout his visit and 
there is talk of a high school reunion while he is in chicago ms 
opper said 
when stolars russianborn parents headed home to help build a 
new soviet society he planned to stay only a short time ms 
opper said 
but change was shuddering through the soviet union and history 
got in the way years passed there was little hope of leaving and 
stolar gave it little thought 
then he married and had a son michael one day the boy came 
home excited at winning a school contest 
he looked at his son so full of hope so full of enthusiasm 
and he thought this boy will never go anywhere in this country 
weve got to get out ms opper said

monday night at a formal dinner preceding the award of the first 
philadelphia liberty medal to the polish solidarity leader 
danuta walesa and one of her sons yaroslaw 15 will stand in 
for walesa at the citys traditional fourth of july ceremony 
tuesday they are to be presented with the medal and the 100000 
cash award that accompanies it

admirers in halting polish which was translated into english 
tuesdays ceremonies will cap the fourday freedom festival 
which included a hotair balloon race parade food festival 
concerts and several fireworks shows 
walesa who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 had said he could 
not attend the ceremonies because of the effort to install a new 
government in poland following the communist countrys first largely 
democratic elections in more than four decades 
philadelphia civic leaders intended the award to focus national 
attention on philadelphia on independence day 
more than 80 nominations were reviewed by an international 
selection committee the award is meant for an individual or 
organization that has demonstrated leadership and vision in the 
pursuit of liberty of conscience or freedom from oppression 
ignorance or deprivation 
the committee said walesa was chosen not only because of his 
courage over many years but also because of his recent 
accomplishments in poland expanding the prospects of political and 
economic liberty 
solidarity was born in the occupation strike at the lenin 
shipyard in gdansk in august 1980 walesa a shipyard electrician 
from the port city led the strike and emerged a folk hero the 
union was recognized as the soviet blocs only legally independent 
union but polish officials later suppressed solidarity activities 
interned walesa and banned the union 
in january 1989 the government decided solidarity could be 
formally registered again as an independent trade union

in the hindu kush mountains 
shattered crumbling huts tell tales their inhabitants probably 
never will of the savagery that turned thousands of villages into 
graveyards 
families that tilled the orchards and fields for unknown 
generations have disappeared the silence is broken by an occasional 
burst of gunfire or a military convoy roaring through the valleys 
where shattered villages cling to the 15000foot mountains like an 
image of armageddon 
what happened to villages like lalma babagilala babamardan and 
babashangrul will not be known until the war between the government 
and moslem guerrillas ends and accounts can be pieced together from 
villagers who escaped 
after a decade of war the barbarity has become widely known but 
in the hindu kush mountains along the river valleys and across the 
plains where the armies of alexander the great and genghis khan once 
marched the scenes of devastation go beyond what was previously 
known about the conflict

almost 500 years ago the 250000 jews who had 
flourished in spain for hundreds of years were forced to convert to 
christianity flee the country or be burned at the stake 
called sephardic jews wherever they later moved over the 
centuries they never lost their passion for their od folk songs 
food and ladino a spanishhebrew language mixture that served as 
their counterpart to yiddish 
now theyre nurturing their culture in america 
after leaving spain many went to north africa italy turkey and 
greece where they learned the customs and language of new 
homelands often faring better in moslem nations than under 
christianity 
many sephardic jews eventually moved to europe south america and 
the united states 
a recent meeting of more than 500 of them in seattle called 
emergence american sephardic jewry today was seen as a kind of 
american comingout affair for them 
hal lewis the new executive vice president of the american 
sephardi federation says the conference was the largest gathering 
of sephardic jews in the nations history and marks the beginning of 
a sephardic renaissance 
there was a time when sephardic traditions were the shining 
light of jewish life and tradition lewis said in an interview 
the jewish community in spain preexpulsion were leaders in 
jewish life they were scientists poets artists philosophers 
advisers to kings it was the golden age of spain 
an estimated 25 million of the worlds 16 million jews are 
sephardim including 60 percent of those who have settled in israel 
but they remain mostly outside dominant circles 
also considered sephardim are jews who trace their ancestry to 
the middle east and northern africa they lack spanish ancestry and 
speak arabic but share religious practices with the spanish 
descendants because both groups looked to the religious center of 
babylonia for rabbinic leadership and rituals 
ashkenazim the majority of jews worldwide today are descended 
from those who looked more to religious centers in northern and 
eastern europe 
since the expulsion from spain in 1492 sephardim have been 
largely overlooked partly because of numbers partly because of 
their internal divisions lewis said 
sephardim although a majority in israel are nonetheless a 
minority in the knesset sephardic studies arent incorporated in 
jewish schools much of the jewish establishment is ignorant of 
sephardic culture and many sephardic communities are isolated he 
said 
seattle has an estimated 4000 sephardic jews the thirdlargest 
community in the nation and 14000 ashkenazim 
seattle is the strongest community in the nation for its size 
and one of the most vibrant in the world lewis said 
that strength is largely because sephardic religious leaders have 
long targeted youth said rabbi solomon maimon spiritual leader of 
sephardic bikur cholim synagogue for more than four decades and back 
from retirement in israel to attend the conference 
we played baseball and basektball with them maimon said 
we had schools and camps and through the youth we got to the 
parents it was healthy it kept people within the fold 
children are called to help lead prayers for the sabbath and 
holidays and many can conduct the prayers in ladino even if they 
dont understand what theyre saying maimon said 
weve done an outstanding job in preserving our heritage 
here maimon added everyone can do it its the vehicle of 
selfpreservation and transition to the future traditions are our 
tools 
he said the conference was an opportunity for participants to 
celebrate where theyve come from and to ask some serious questions 
about where the sephardic community in the united states is going 
the sephardim have much to learn from their ashkenazi 
counterparts in organization fund raising education philanthropy 
and helping israel and jews in distress lewis said 
but he added that the ashkenazi world has a lot to learn from 
sephardim too 
the sephardim always prided themselves on tolerance respect 
for opinions and ways of others lewis said its possible to be 
both a part of and apart from society in which they live thats an 
aspect of jewish life that ashkenazi can learn from 
in many cases sephardic history is a lot richer in terms of 
culture and tradition than eastern europe

with all flags flying fireworks bursting in 
air congress in recess and president bush in kennebunkport theres 
a holiday pause in the legislative race toward a constitutional ban 
on flag burning 
but not in the patriotic speechmaking 
house speaker thomas s foley wants calm careful deliberations 
in place of the emotional rush to amend the constitution and 
overrule the supreme court 
the political tide is not running that way 
theres an amendment ready to go bush went to the flagraising 
iwo jima monument overlooking washington on friday to urge swift 
congressional approval of a simple direct and to the point 
amendment 
it declares 
the congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the 
physical desecration of the flag of the united states 
at a hastily arranged rally the president said for the sake of 
the fallen for the men behind the guns for every american we will 
defend this flag 
the defense is symbolic theres no sign that the flag is in 
danger of wholesale desecration the court license notwithstanding 
while in recess house members who joined an allnight flagathon 
can attest to their patriotism by shipping home television tapes of 
the speeches they made during a session that kept going until nearly 
9 am thursday there was nobody on the floor to listen but the 
tapes wont show that 
before recessing for independence day the senate and house both 
adopted resolutions assailing the supreme courts june 21 decision 
that burning an american flag is a permissible expression of protest 
under the first amendment 
the issue is easy and automatic the agenda in congress is filled 
with close questions and hard choices but not this one it is black 
and white or red white and blue 
most everybody signed on three senators and five house members 
voted against the resolutions saying that the right to dissent was 
too precious for tampering even on flag desecration which they all 
denounced 
one of them sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire offered a 
conservatives common sense but was drowned out by the chorus of 
flag speeches 
no one likes desecration but this just seems to me an exercise 
in silliness and even a little bit of hypocrisy if i may say so 
humphrey told the senate 
in the house foley said congress should act carefully on the 
issue with hearings on the best way to protect the flag 
there does seem to be time for that but it doesnt fit the 
political mood 
behind it all lies a question the supreme court doesnt answer 
why the justices chose to deal with the flag case in the first 
place it was not an urgent issue indeed hardly a visible one 
until the court ruled even though 48 states and the federal 
government had flag desecration laws it involved a flag burning 
conviction that already had been overturned by a texas appeals court 
which got no national attention 
and there are other ways to punish people who burn flags in 
public places the court said it wasnt suggesting a flag burner 
couldnt be prosecuted for stealing the flag involved was snatched 
from in front of a dallas texas bank or for trespassing 
disorderly conduct or arson 
but the court has said all it will say and the next move is up 
to congress it will reconvene on july 11 the house offering its 
regular pledge of allegiance to the flag at the start of its 
session during the flag outcry more than one member noted that 
practice no member noted its origin 
the house pledge is hardly a tradition it began last sept 13 
when bush was making the pledge of allegiance into a campaign issue 
against gov michael dukakis who once vetoed a bill to require it 
in massachusetts classrooms 
until that happened the house said the pledge once a year on 
flag day june 14

it will be a seething second half of the year in 
corporate society in new york in washington and tokyo and 
wherever else the captains of industry and their lawyers meet to 
scrap 
corporate society once a comradely caste who sat on each others 
boards talked yachting at the club and shared the same parlor 
car from summerhome communities are now brawling like street 
fighters 
why you can hardly lift your arm in a toast to continued good 
profits without some scoundrel picking your pocket you never know 
if the rascal youre chatting with might raid your operation 
tomorrow and dump you on the streets 
corporate good manners steadily eroding since the great 
industrial revolution have now been abandoned the devices employed 
by todays new and avaricious tycoons are ungentlemanly even 
scandalous and often illegal 
nobody knows how to behave michael milken the most successful 
financier of all time measured by the billions he has raised has 
been indicted paul bilzerian has resigned as singer co chairman 
after being convicted of criminal charges and of course several 
big financiers are residing in the cooler 
the decline is international in japan t boone pickens the 
texas investor was denied three seats on the board of koito 
manufacturing tokyo although he owns 20 percent of the company an 
insult to be sure but it gets worse 
pickens said he was prepared for the rebuff but he probably 
wasnt ready for the accompaniments days before the meeting rumors 
spread that the company had hired toughs to disrupt his 
presentation then the companys japanese and american advisers 
issued claims that he had ties to the japanese underworld 
it was no better in new york where j richard munro time inc 
chairman erupted in anger when the nervy martin davis paramount 
communications chief thwarted munros dream of a quick timewarner 
communications merger 
munro unloaded all his ammunition he wrote a personal letter to 
davis who offered 175 a share and later 200 for shares then 
selling at about l25 saying he had serious questions about your 
integrity and motives davis he added was motivated more by 
spite than strategy and his offer was cynical if not downright 
deceptive 
indicating that some of the good old days somehow managed to 
survive time had the foresight to induce several big banks to 
refuse money to anyone seeking to raid the company 
time also determined that it could avoid giving shareholders a 
say in the timewarner deal although it is sometimes alleged that 
shareholders own the companies in which they invest 
times lawyers asked various communities in which time held 
cabletv franchises to complain to federal officials about davis 
offer the time board rejected paramounts offer out of hand it 
declined to speak with davis 
throughout this maneuvering the world wondered whatever happened 
to shareholder rights to the obligation of multimillionaire 
executives to those who helped make them that way to noblesse 
oblige or the appearance of it 
as the first half of the corporate social year drew to a close 
an answer to those questions was scheduled for the courts maybe the 
securities and exchange commission would get involved too and the 
federal communications commission 
and that of course meant more uncivil scrapping right out 
there in the public arena for all the hoi polloi to witness 
couldnt anything be kept quiet anymore didnt anyone have a sense 
of propriety 
for the executive class it was downright embarassing and 
degrading and it seemed to be getting worse

it looks more like a network newscast than its 
predecessors and the news reports are the freshest yet live in 
fact the first showing each week 
but firsttime viewers of not necessarily the news on home box 
office wont be confused for long particularly when the news anchor 
reports that the chinese are claiming the leader of the student 
uprising was morgan fairchild or that yassir arafats mother is 
upset that he didnt come to dinner sunday 
the hbo comedy series that began seven years ago started its new 
season may 31 with a new cast and new format but with the old 
irreverence still intact 
not necessarily the news also airs live each wednesday to 
give it a topicality it didnt have before it will be repeated but 
only within the same week 
the new version has two anchors annabelle gurwitch and tom 
parks plus some contributing editors lucy webb is the only 
returning member of the old cast 
the trouble before was that it had no linear construction no 
link said coexecutive producer john moffitt you had four or 
five cast members who played all parts from newsmen to crazy 
general our trademark was taking real news footage and manipulating 
it and cutting it with phony questions from our newsmen cast 
but there was no audience identification with our people it 
never achieved an audience following it was bounced around the 
schedule and there was never anyone in the cast you could get 
attached to because no one ever had enough air time 
nevertheless the show is the most honored program on cable its 
won 12 ace awards plus numerous other citations 
the show was adapted by moffitt and his partner pat tourk lee 
from the british program not the nine oclock news it was 
originally sold to abc but the network didnt know how to program 
it and turned it back to moffitt and lee they sold it to hbo 
wed previously done fridays for abc and it was censored 
said moffitt we have no censorship on hbo but now that we dont 
have to push to get things on were more circumspect take china 
for instance now that things have turned sour there and the 
students were killed and people are being executed were being more 
delicate 
we used president bushs response to the china situation which 
was so wishywashy he expressed deep regret which we said falls 
just short of total regret we made a point and made people 
think 
the show was less forthright in poking fun at the proposed 
timewarner merger and the subsequent bid by paramount to take over 
time hbo is a division of time inc its hard to bite the hand 
that feeds you said moffitt 
we did have a test tone like that of the emergency broadcast 
system the announcer said this is a test from the corporate 
takeover service if this had been an actual takeover you would have 
been advised what action to take 
abcs fridays was a copy of nbcs saturday night live it 
lasted two years 198082 and is best known for the amazing 
realistic fight scene that the late comedian andy kaufman engineered 
on the show there are still people who refuse to believe we 
didnt set that up said moffitt 
moffitt and lee also produce the annual comic relief for hbo 
which has raised more than 10 million for medical aid to the 
homeless 
not necessarily the news began on hbo in september 1982 and 
in its first four years was a halfhour show later it became a 
series of onehour specials which made it difficult to be topical 
the show was severely affected by the writers strike last year but 
returned in time to wrap up the reagan legacy

untold stories about the people places and events making news

functional illiteracy in this country is widely 
recognized as a serious problem but beyond this there are many who 
can read enough to get by but find theyd rather do anything else 
for this group a remarkable program based on childrens books 
offers a way of entry to the cultural mainstream

marie isenor wife mother and convenience 
store clerk dropped out of high school five months before 
graduation shes kept a low profile ewhen i go to meetings im always 
the one in the back not 
saying much ive always been interested in graphic arts but i 
never since 
ver did anything about it i didnt think i was smart enough 
shes beginning to see herself differently due largely to a 
series of childrens book discussions at the library the 
gatherings led by an area scholar brought together a wide range of 
people from adult basic education students like isenor to college 
graduates 
i wasnt there five minutes before i was involved in the 
discussion says isenor who lives in quechee rather than drop 
out after mily reading project in her 
case as in most the experiment seems to be working 
i learned a lot about how other people think some thought a 
lot along my lines i pretty much always thought i was on my own 
that i was the only person who had those kinds of thoughts 
discussion leader nick boke who teaches history at a community 
college learned something too theres a statistic that gets 
thrown around that only 20 percent of the population can think 
abstractly this confirmed my belief its because only 20 percent 
of the population has ever been asked 
the family reading project is based on a modest formula choose 
10 classic childrens books on a single theme courage for 
example or friendship give them to 20 or 30 adults from a 
crosssection of the community then invite them back for three 
monthly discussions led by a humanities scholar 
that simple recipe is yielding rich intellectual fare its also 
shattering stereotypes building selfesteem and easing isolation 
i can go all winter and never see anyone says pv hall a 
mother of two who lives near killington ski area 
i started coming to the reading group thinking i was doing it 
for the kids i ended up feeling it was more for me 
the discussions also give adults from all layers of society the 
same chance to discover the wonder of books and to pass it along to 
their children 
reading is transformative says project director sally 
anderson a former librarian and reading teacher its so 
meanspirited to make it a class issue 
yet classconsciousness often trespasses into public education 
were so middle class our schools are so middle class we take so 
many things for granted anderson says we say to parents just 
tell your kids to turn off the tv but some parents dont have the 
selfesteem to take control of their families 
others may lack the necessary vocabulary or reading ability to 
decipher a complex puzzling world she says we have all these 
visual signs if you dont know the signs you are really cut off in 
ways most of us dont even understand 
the family reading project has its roots in a similar reading and 
discussion program begun 11 years ago by a vermont librarian to 
encourage people to read better books the program she started has 
now been held in more than half of vermonts 251 communities 
in 1986 an adult basic education tutor asked organizers to 
create a similar program for her students many lived on back roads 
not served by public transportation and felt cut off from their 
communities and their neighbors 
a discussion group for these people complete with child care 
could provide an entree to libraries and other cultural centers 
anderson thought 
it also could show newly literate adults that reading can be more 
than a survival skill something new readers get too few 
opportunities to find out 
it takes a special genius to make reading boring says 
anderson an energetic forthright woman who realized early in her 
career that no one ever came to the library looking for the sequel 
to dick and jane 
most adult reading texts are no more compelling she says for 
every see spot run theres a grownup equivalent bill had a 
gun it was black 
once you take the richness out of language who cares 
anderson says nobody comes home at night and says oh god ive 
got a new stove i cant wait to read the manual 
textbooks may teach reading she thought but they dont teach 
the love of reading thats literatures job but what sort of 
literature surely no one who reads at a fourthgrade level should 
be expected to plow through the grapes of wrath 
but why not charlottes web or make way for ducklings 
why not the best of childrens literature 
would grown men and women be insulted at the prospect of reading 
the same books as their gradeschoolers anderson didnt think so 
childrens literature is complex any of these books can be 
discussed on deep psychological levels 
how about the college professors writers and other highbrows 
whod be leading the discussions how would they feel about focusing 
their analytical skills on the biggest bear 
good literature is good literature says nick boke 
wellchosen words work the main difference between adult 
literature and childrens literature is that childrens books have 
fewer words

the issues are the same they are the human issues loneliness 
love fear bravery the small triumphs of daytoday existence 
and so with a grant from the vermont council on the humanities 
the new program connections made its debut in six towns in 1986 
some books were more advanced than others but participants were 
given tapes to help them through the tougher ones they also got 
extra coaching from their tutors 
the scholars got some coaching too organizers urged them to act 
as discussion leaders rather than teachers as soon as a program 
like this smacks of school people cant hear they shut down 
anderson says 
at first boke recalls participants were wary there they sat 
book in hand with a nowwhat look on their faces 
it didnt take long for the books to work their magic 
make way for ducklings the story of a duck who escorts her 
brood through boston traffic to a new home in the public garden 
sparked a lively discussion about the trials of getting kids to 
mind ramona and her father about a girl whose father loses his 
job prompted a revelation i never knew that kids worried one 
mother said 
tales of ducks bears and spiders encouraged talk of love trust 
and courage and the more people talked the more evident it became 
connections could do more than help people become better readers it 
also could help them become better parents 
the next year the program expanded to 14 towns then to the 
state hospital and the prisons where corrections officials 
witnessed a minor miracle inmates refrained from both ethnic slurs 
and swearing during their book discussions 
for a while at the state hospital it was unclear who were the 
staff members and who were the patients for a while it didnt much 
matter 
folks were connecting with books with ideas with each other 
that might have been that had it not dawned on organizers that the 
program was popular not only with adults 
it also scored points with their kids 
some parents who sat down to read their new books to their 
children discovered the kids already knew the stories theyd been 
busy memorizing the tapes 
one mother engrossed in ramona and her father told her 
hungry family shed be happy to fix their dinner as soon as she 
finished her book i couldnt feed those kids til 7 that night 
she said 
a mother unwilling to tear herself away from her book sends a 
powerful message reading is fun 
for some people these were the first books theyd ever 
owned says michael bouman executive director of the state 
council on the humanities 
one man moved his bowling trophies so he could more prominently 
display his new books all kinds of things were happening that we 
didnt have the vision to anticipate 
which gave bouman the welleducated father of two nonreading 
teenagers an idea why not start a childrens book discussion 
group for experienced readers with the goal of encouraging people 
throughout vermont to read to children 
the vermont council on the humanities family reading project 
came off the drawing board last fall with a grant from the national 
endowment for the humanities and a lot of crossed fingers at the 
last minute its architects decided to combine new readers with old 
in some groups 
some organizers were worried what if abe students felt too 
intimidated to take part in the discussions what if integrating the 
two groups produced only painful reminders of past school failures 
anderson was convinced the new readers could hold their own 
the idea that poor people are dull that they have no intellectual 
curiosity is absolutely false 
leading an earlier connections discussion group had helped her 
clear the last vestiges of social stereotyping from her own mind 
here was a chance to help others do the same 
at first nick boke says abe students did stand out but only 
by their incredible shyness the sad thing is that in many cases 
theyve done little less than those who made it through school 
the ones who made it just lucked out a little or put in that 
extra 14th of a percent effort to get the degree abe students are 
not dramatically different from a lot of high school graduates 
except in how they feel about themselves 
watching feelings change and shyness disappear has been the 
highlight of the project says boke its very exciting to watch 
people find the joy of using their minds and being recognized for 
it 
by years end organizers hope to complete 32 family reading 
programs in 27 towns with more planned for next year similar 
programs are being developed in the other new england states along 
with a study to gauge their effectiveness abe tutors already report 
that the switch from textbooks to storybooks has greatly increased 
students motivation 
you have quite a brain on you nick boke remarked to one 
participant at the last session what are you going to do with 
it 
marie isenor who never thought she was smart enough has given 
bokes comments some thought shes studying for her high school 
equivalency diploma 
and she recently took her first graphic arts course

in this the bicentennial of the french 
revolution frances influence as a world power is waning be that 
as it may a large proportion of frenchmen insist charles de gaulle 
proved a generation ago that even a france on the ropes is a vital 
force in the world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
divided at home humbled abroad the french 
resolutely resist the judgment of a growing number of outsiders that 
the nation has slipped into the second ranks of world power 
frances economy is threequarters the size of west germanys a 
third of japans its latest foreign adventure a relief attempt in 
lebanon ended in debacle its influence in africa is melting away 
although france keeps its own nuclear arsenal it is edging 
closer toward nato seeking a part in the vast electronic air 
defense and battlefield command system planned by atlantic allies 
steadily its once influential foreign policy is slipping into 
the shadow of west germany 
the comfortable old channels of domestic politics are blurred by 
rebellion at the center a new appeal by ecologist candidates toward 
the left and antiimmigrant extremism at the far right 
traditional values are changing at an unprecedented pace young 
rockers new conservatives rootless travelers the new tribes 
according to pop commentators splinter sectors of society 
and the nation that traces itself back to feisty gauls who stood 
up to caesar is joining 11 european partners in a dream of unity a 
popular french thinker calls a darwinian nightmare 
whatever indicators might show however a sizable proportion of 
frenchmen insist charles de gaulle proved a generation ago that even 
a france on the ropes is a vital force in the world 
jacques chirac the former premier who lost presidential 
elections last year to francois mitterrand told reporters recently 
that france was a waning power only because it acted like one 
gaullism is not an ideology but a way of behaving said 
chirac now mayor of paris before leaving for new york to talk 
about france on the bicentennial of its revolution 
chirac a conservative who heads frances neogaullist rally for 
the republic party argued that countrymen from across the political 
spectrum subscribed to what the former president represented in 
rebuilding postwar france 
general de gaulle followed two basic concepts a certain idea 
of the nation and a certain idea of man he said 
exactly said philippe gillieron marketing director for the 
eiffel tower who considers the soaring steel girders a symbol of 
what france means to the world he explained 
economically if maybe were bigger than togo or even greece 
were no major power but in culture for our ideas on human rights 
and the evolution of humanity we have an active distinct role 
when the eiffel tower opened 100 years ago gillieron said it 
marked a new epoch of industrial prowess today he said centennial 
festivities heralded a revolution in global communications 
after all he concluded the eiffel tower is as well known 
to the world as cocacola 
mitterrand is hard at work realizing an old dream to build the 
worlds most modern library according to the plan work starts in 
1991 on the billiondollar complex covering 173 acres 
to emphasize its role as at least a symbolic power france is 
celebrating its bicentennial with everything from a string of 
summits to sheep on the champs elysees 
a twohour july 14 parade named la marseillaise included 
chinese breakdancers among the 8000 participants from around the 
world 
counting such monuments as the opera bastille a glass pyramid 
for the louvre and new gold leaf for the invalides dome the cost 
ran into the billions of dollars 
frenchmen who date their history back 2000 years not 200 tend 
to dismiss the revolutionary rage as unseemly many regard 
imagebuilding abroad as a diversion from pressing problems at home

its a fiasco said serge barbarin a 27yearold winemaker 
in medoc north of bordeaux celebrations were planned at the last 
minute to lure tourists these people in power are not serious 
barbarin heir to the bistonbrillette vineyards at moulis is 
not worried about grandeur france he said has never failed to 
change with the times and come out at the head table 
instead he fears a race to compete on uncertain ground might 
damage the quality proportion and pace of life that once made 
france so pleasant for frenchmen 
he leads a visitor among the oaken casks where deep red wine 
takes its time to mature in centuriesold cellars suddenly he 
glances at his watch and says sorry to rush but my computer is 
arriving 
in almost every aspect france today takes the cliche land of 
contrasts to extremes 
along the champs elysees franchise burgers are sold at seven 
outlets between the arc de triomphe and the concorde but to most 
frenchmen fast food means leaving the table after the first hour 
north of paris supersonic concordes swoop over the farmlands of 
picardy studded with stone cathedrals and still partly tilled by 
peasants for whom a restaurant meal is an unthinkable luxury 
fast trains streak by canals where tiny boats carry produce to 
the floating market at amiens not all that unlike traditional 
markets in the farflung places that france once colonized 
up along the english channel and just inland from the riviera 
speculators pay inflated prices for stately old houses and flimsy 
eyesores that are popping up in empty spaces once left for gardens 
on the beach near san raphael just down the coast from cannes a 
developer is building a tourist village of 10000 beds 
but across vast sections of the center historic hamlets collapse 
in disrepair and small farm families throw in the towel after 
centuries on the land 
at the edge of little towns all over the french countryside vast 
tinsided hypermarche shopping centers are becoming as 
ubiquitous as the mossy church on the square 
in the picardy town of roye marcelle carpentiervasset in her 
70s still sizes up her customers to determine how many eggs to put 
in the omelete when impressed she goes up to five 
im afraid for my kids she says things are going badly in 
france no jobs few prospects i dont know what to expect 
unemployment in fact seems to be easing slightly from its 
persistent level of 10 percent and officials insist things will 
improve after 1992 when european partners forge a single market 
premier michel rocard along with most of frances political 
leaders pushes hard for a tightly linked europe in which france 
they say will inevitably play a leading role 
chirac wields a sheaf of studies that predict paris will evolve 
back into its natural role as the capital of europe 
but that seems to be at the heart of the malaise barbarin 
mentioned which few of the people who share his sentiment can put 
in specific terms 
the attraction of paris is largely geographic its fast trains 
and large airports will accommodate a polyglot tide ebbing and 
flowing from portugal to the baltic sea 
already the treasured city of light is slipping from real life 
into tourist brochures paris awakes to rebroadcasts of dan rather 
in english its menus are subtitled in german and japanese 
on the outskirts eurodisneyland is hiring 12000 people and 
training them to smile at strangers all day long 
if the french capital is the capital of a borderless europe a 
lot of people are beginning to ask what happens to their certain 
idea of france

few are those who can think of france and not 
immediately think of food 
french art may be on the wane french literature leans heavily on 
past reputation and a french intellectual of international stature 
is hard to find 
but the countrys reputation as one of the best places in the 
world to eat is both enduring and well deserved 
he who invents a new dish will have rendered humanity a greater 
service than the scientist who discovers a planet said anthelme 
brillatsavarin the 18th century lawyer and government official who 
wrote physiology of taste 
that is perhaps the best expression of a frenchmans attitude 
toward the dinner table 
to be sure not everything that comes from france is better and 
while haute cuisine may be as good as it ever was restaurants 
of medium quality where customers could always get a good meal for a 
moderate price are fast disappearing 
but there is little doubt the french brought the culinary art to 
its apex top chefs food historians and critics agree that the 
basic reason is an accident of geography 
we are privileged from the point of view of climate says 
threestar chef emile jung 
adds bernard naegellen director of the michelin red guide all 
of the agriculture of temperate countries is represented here and i 
think its that the great variety of agricultural products meat 
game that has given the french the habit of eating well 
but to the products must be added the creativity 
there is in the french genius for gastronomy something of the 
cartesian dream to order the universe to refine the physical until 
it is trembling on the brink of the ideal wrote historian sanche 
de gramont 20 years ago perhaps getting a bit carried away 
the genius of french cooking according to jung lies in the 
wine both simmering in its sauces and in the glass 
also the french are not afraid to spend an inordinate amount of 
time thinking about what others may consider a frivolous subject 
there is no place where they talk as much about food says 
food historian philip hyman the french are very knowledgeable 
about food

few events in recent medical history captured the 
publics interest more than the implantation of artificial hearts in 
humans but the recipients all died within months and the procedure 
has not been tried again in several years now with a shortage of 
donors of human hearts for transplantation some in the medical 
community want to resume using permanent mechanical hearts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the three years since the last of the 
recipients of artificial hearts died the manmade blood pumps have 
been used only to keep patients alive until they could get a human 
heart transplant 
william j schroeder 52 the second of five permanent artificial 
heart recipients was the longest to live he died on aug 7 1986 
of a stroke 620 days after the operation 
now with a shortage of human heart donors a pioneer in the 
transplant field says its time to resume implanting permanent 
artificial hearts despite their shortcomings 
but the inventor of the most successful artificial heart to date 
disagrees saying research efforts should be concentrated on 
developing a better pump 
and the surgeon most noted for implanting permanent artificial 
hearts has indicated little interest in resuming the work 
nonetheless dr jack g copeland says the time has come to try 
again 
copeland in 1985 became the first surgeon to use an artificial 
heart successfully as a temporary bridge to transplantation of a 
human heart he says that despite its shortcomings he has now 
changed his thinking about permanent implantation of the primary 
artificial heart now in use the airdriven symbion j7 formerly 
known as the jarvik7 
one of those shortcomings is that the recipient is tethered 
through the abdominal wall to a pneumatic drive unit weighing about 
300 pounds 
in a recent interview copeland said the device should be used 
for patients with endstage heart disease who do not qualify for 
transplants because of their age or other health problems 
i think in small terms about individual lives one at a time 
and why is somebody whos dying of heart disease any less valuable 
to us than somebody who has an aortic valve replacement or a 
coronary bypass says copeland who heads the hearttransplant 
program at the university of arizona 
i know theres something i can do for him i just dont have 
the money i dont have the support i dont have somebody who says 
ok dr copeland we give you approval for so many cases 
the biggest obstacles to anyone resuming implanting artificial 
hearts he says are money the pressures of life in a fishbowl and 
the publics inability to view such procedures as experimental and 
allow us to fail 
the international society for heart transplantation says 2650 
transplants were performed worldwide last year including 1630 in 
the united states there were 1441 in this country in 1987 
experts say the number of donor hearts is reaching a plateau 
though surveys have suggested that from 20000 to 75000 americans 
could benefit annually if the supply was available 
copeland believes the problems that plagued longterm recipients 
of artificial hearts including infection bleeding strokes and 
clotting can be solved and patients could be released to live in an 
apartment within about three weeks after surgery 
if i could get somebody to come up with enough bucks to do it 
i would do it he says 
i think that hes perfectly justified to do that says dr 
robert jarvik inventor of the jarvik7 and jarvik770 artificial 
hearts 
but because of the expense of artificial heart implantation and 
care as well as their lack of mobility jarvik says its unlikely 
the currently designed pump will be pursued for permanent use 
if dr copeland has resources and the availability to work on 
it thats fine its ethically justified he can help some 
people jarvik says but i think in general most people want to 
work on electric powered systems 
copeland concurs but argues that until a better internally 
powered device is developed tested and available lives can be 
prolonged by permanently implanting the current devices 
i think we agree says gerson rosenberg assistant chief for 
the division of artificial organs at pennsylvania state universitys 
hershey medical center dr william pierce the director designed 
the penn state artificial heart and its second recipient lived with 
it for 397 days 
rosenberg says most people in the field agree that the longterm 
answer will lie with development of electrically driven permanently 
implantable hearts but he says the current devices could be put to 
worthwhile use in some patients until then 
dr william devries performed four of the five permanent jarvik 
implants schroeder survived a record 620 days but he three other 
americans and leif stenberg who received a jarvik7 in sweden all 
developed strokes and other fatal complications from the 
plasticandmetal pumps 
jarvik notes that the federal food and drug administration which 
authorizes use of experimental medical devices wont allow clinical 
testing of a device unless it is intended for widespread use

on one trip as we reached the kansasnebraska line dad decided 
to look up a distant cousin whom he hadnt seen since boyhood 
ed is the burlington railroad station agent in beatrice said 
dad 
i thought he lived in wymore said mother 
dad snorted in disgust at fallible female memories we roared 
through wymore and proceeded 14 miles on an unbelievably bad road to 
beatrice cousin ed ran the station in wymore 
furious dad retraced the route as though he were driving ben 
hurs chariot and i remember poor tony hanging upside down and 
squawking good night good night 
blig was not a pet but a fourfooted family member when the 
snooty desk clerk at the hotel fontenelle in omaha made it plain 
that dogs were unwelcome dick and i managed to get the terrorized 
animal seven floors up the fire escape the next morning we all 
came grandly down the elevator to the astonishment if not delight 
of the staff 
bligs trust in us was deep but not bottomless once following 
a sudden rain when our car had slipped off the road three times in 
a mile blig took his place in the truck at the head of the tow 
line gazing back at us anxiously through the rear window the bones 
that served him for 16 years lie beneath a handsome oak in south 
tulsa he deserves his rest 
the good earth of the midwest as the world knows grows fine 
corn and wheat and properly graded it makes a tolerable road if 
you can stand the dust but the first sprinkles of an earnest rain 
back in the early 20s meant things would happen fast to cars with 
narrow highpressure tires guaranteed for 8000 miles 
one time the storm hit us when the lamoni iowa water tower was 
already in sight we didnt make it and had to be hauled to the 
beginning of lamonis brick pavement by a team there we stayed for 
three days waiting for the roads to dry out enough to get us to des 
moines 
in three days you can get pretty well acquainted with lamoni 
which got its name out of the book of mormon and still possesses a 
latterday saints college in driving i35 i have occasionally 
turned off two miles to see if lamoni has changed it hasnt 
another town i knew intimately was wamego kan where we 
remained for five days while a differential gear was making its way 
on the union pacific from kansas city at wamego there was a summer 
chautauqua a strictly american invention named for the vacation 
colony in new york state they flourished best in the premovie and 
preradio days and brought culture and entertainment to the 
boondocks 
chautauquas featured famous preachers humorous speakers 
exgovernors swiss bellringers and dramatic selections like east 
lynne and simon slick from punkin crick but for the faulty gear i 
would never have seen one 
much of cityliving young america today alas rides the 
interstates which is like going through a pipeline or flies over 
the clouds either way without contact with rural life it was 
different if you crosscountried in the 20s 
our favorite touring car was a large open marmon painted in two 
shades of green we called it the cucumber it was marvelously 
commodious but its make was rare and when we snapped a fan belt 
and sought a replacement in village garages we might as well have 
asked for new main bearings for the mauretania 
thus it was that we once went boiling across southern nebraska 
from windmill to windmill making the acquaintance of astonished 
farmers and harvest hands of course we were invited to lunch 
rural hospitality was great partly out of native kindness and 
partly because our windblown party with its traveling zoo generated 
irrestible curiosity but there were dangers too 
on one occasion when the cucumber spent the night in the ditch 
near storm lake iowa a concerned farm wife accommodated dick and 
me on a straw tick in the attic with a kerosene lamp for company 
there was nothing to read but dr winfields home counselor and 
for weeks thereafter i came down successively with polio leprosy 
appendicitis tuberculosis and various dementias 
no modern youngster has any idea of the confusion when all 
america simultaneously was trying to struggle out of the mud road 
improvements meant detours and a detour french for turn from 
was invariably worse than the road for which it substituted once 
when they were trying to build a passable road between nowata and 
coffeyville we literally drove down a creek bed 
at that time it was impossible to get a car from tulsa to st 
louis for there was no road at all over the ozarks citizens of 
springfield determined to visit relatives in lebanon or rolla took 
the frisco 
on our second or third trip dad did succeed in getting in one 
day from tulsa to horton kan 265 miles the speed impressed him 
so much that he wrote an editorial about it 
usually it took us from seven to nine days to reach grandmas 
barring a major breakdown in the meantime unexpected intelligence 
came to us 
i remember a lions club luncheon to which we found ourselves 
listening in the hotel dining room at iola or was it yates center 
enthusiastic evangelists from claremore described the therapeutic 
effects of radium water in such technicolor detail the 
bleeding sores the running pus that we had a short lunch 
we would finally arrive at the wonderful victorian house that 
grandpa had ordered built for 4000 a prodigy of extravagance for 
a young lawyer it is now 125 years old and occupied by a bishop 
in spite of dads clenched teeth and unpredictable explosions i 
think as i look back on it that he was a paragon of patience 
the best im sure dad never intended but by daring to drive 
his family to wisconsin when roads featured dust or gumbo when 
accommodations were chancy or worse when tires were thin and gear 
boxes fragile we all had a look at an america that the city kids 
were missing and that would never come again 
after almost seven decades our journeys to grandmas still live 
with me they added much to the wonder of it all

pepsi cola recently found a buyer for 20 outmoded 
soviet warships giving down the hatch a new meaning indeed 
pepsi has had its toe in the soviet union for years now operating 
21 plants there in exchange it helps moscow import stolichnaya

are the fizzy cola wars about to be fought on a brandnew 
battleground 
pepsi recently helped the soviet union sell 20 warships that 
puts them 13 more than sevenup on cocacola coke has no navy so 
far 
has arms dealing opened a new chapter in american business will 
avis try harder by leasing tanks will whoppers come with sesame 
seed bombs 
pepsi cola entered the arms race backward actually by 
finding a norwegian scrap buyer for 17 soviet submarines not the 
kind of subs that in boston come with sandwich meats lettuce and 
dressing the kind that come with torpedoes 
pepsi was also middleman for sale of a soviet cruiser destroyer 
and frigate which is not exactly a glass of carbonated nost it 
gives down the hatch a new meaning for a soft drink guzzler 
pepsi scored a kremlin coup over coke in 1959 when boss donald m 
kendall adroitly cooled off the heated and worldtelevised 
khrushchevnixon kitchen debate by offering the combatants some 
of his cola pepsi has had its toe in the iron curtain ever since 
pepsi now has 21 plants in the soviet union in exchange it helps 
moscow import stolichnaya vodka into the united states which gives 
parents pain relief from coping with the pepsi generation call it 
fair trade 
recently mikhail gorbachev decided to sell off for scrap and hard 
currency the 20 outmoded warships it has been reported pepsi 
actually bought them nyet it just found a buyer for free 
customer relations like taking a client to a ball game 
still 
normally the weapons of business success in the united states 
have been a better mousetrap or a smart lawyer there have however 
been infrequent corporate calls to arms 
the very associated press that brings you this dispatch had its 
origins in 1848 partly because packet boats of rival new york papers 
hunting the seas for incoming european news began shooting at one 
another in an excess of competitive zeal damn the torpedoes and 
the expense cried manhattans many publishers lets buy one packet 
and pool the news and the costs 
one of the most memorable corporate defense forces belonged to 
jim fisk unarguably profiled by his biographer as an improbable 
rascal 
fisk rose from circus hand and yankee peddler after the civil war 
to become a boardroom buccaneer great of mirth and girth and a 
waxed mustache the color of a jersey cow 
when he acquired two steamers that plied between new york and new 
england he ornamented the staterooms with 250 singing canaries and 
himself in the dress uniform of a us admiral further embellished 
with diamonds that festooned his corpulence 
admiral fisk who his biographer says couldnt distinguish a 
compass from a capstan later added a land force new yorks 
languishing ninth regiment he became its colonel and recruited from 
his grand opera house where he oversaw both his erie railroad whose 
stock he lavishly watered and the demon cancan girls whom he as 
liberally champagned 
he enlisted the opera house orchestra as regimental band which 
saluted him by playing hail to the chief the coloneladmiral 
even took the boys with him on bivouac to fashionable long branch 
nj where maneuvers were described by cynics as a monumental 
weeklong drunk in the command post at the continental hotel 
fisks army alas could not protect their leader from being 
slain by a jealous rival for the pudgy but bejeweled hand of josie 
mansfield an aspiring actress delicately said to have bartered 
purity for subsistence 
since fisks day the corporate uniform of the day has quieted 
down to dark suits enlivened by a necktie somber enough to be buried 
in rather than 250 canaries and a regimental orchestra pepsi has 
only michael jackson to sing its praises 
but pepsi has struck first in the battleship biz while it is 
helping to recycle old warships coke has only its familiar aluminum 
cans to send to the smelter is there an arms racer on the horizon 
kendall reportedly chortled to brent scowcroft the white house 
security adviser that pepsi is disarming the soviet union faster 
than you are 
if that is so and nosetickling cola turns out to be the missing 
key to world peace pepsi can boast it started the dove rolling 
ahead of cocacola somehow coke is going to have to get into the 
peace race strive for the higher ground 
maybe for starters make a bid on scrapping the iron curtain

when social workers in floridas pinellas county 
realized that homeless people werent coming to the free medical 
clinics they decided to take a clinic to the people a mobile 
medical team now seeks out people in need of health care whether 
they have the means to pay or not 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dr geoffrey greene makes house 
calls but only to people who dont have homes 
greene heads a mobile medical team that makes the rounds of 
pinellas county shelters and soup kitchens to bring medicine and 
hope to those down on their health as well as their luck 
they work out of a 70000 van set up like a doctors office 
i was destitute i got immediate help here and im very 
grateful says otis simone 53 an outofwork barber who suffers 
from bleeding ulcers and glaucoma 
no one else cared says jim daniels as he accompanied his 
fiancee elizabeth craps to the blueandwhite miniclinic parked in 
front of st vincent depauls soup kitchen she was treated for 
anemia and seizures 
greene registered nurse faith bennett social worker phyllis 
kleckley and secretarydriver ann campbell make up the team their 
workshop includes an exam table scale refrigerator for medicines 
cabinet for supplies telephone bathroom and a tiny desk with a 
folder of files 
medical care is free to the homeless in what county officials say 
is the only such mobile outreach operation of its kind in the 
southeast 
the concept is to go where the people are greene says a 
lot of these people would have no medical treatment at all if not 
for a program like this 
they see an estimated 15 patients daily many with problems 
related to alcohol and cocaine abuse others come with cuts from 
fights or muggings feet or skin problems lice viruses sometimes 
tumors in kids the team finds everything from colds to chicken pox 
the program began last june and is operated by the countys 
department of social services under an annual budget of 265000 
said supervisor jim dates 
the only other program i know of thats like it is in new york 
city dates says there arent a lot of us 
the county has two clinics that help the indigent but we felt 
very strongly that because the homeless people werent coming to 
them we had to go out to them dates says 
greene was at the university of south florida in 1986 doing his 
residency in internal medicine when he grew disillusioned 
i felt the emphasis was misplaced he says we need 
specialties but a lot of medical problems we see are treatable and 
preventable long before they get to the intensive care stage 
when he heard about the program he applied 
the mobile medical team also tries to plug in patients to other 
assistance programs financial vocational or established medical 
clinics if the ailment is long term such as diabetes 
greene had expected to treat mostly middleaged alcoholics but 
he also found people with drug and mental problems women with 
dependent children on the run from abusive husbands families who 
couldnt make ends meet on unskilled minimum wage jobs and those who 
just chose to drop out and live on the edge 
like everyone i had misconceptions about the homeless the 
doctor says you just dont realize how bad it is until you start 
working with it 
dates who has been involved in social work for nine years said 
families account for the biggest increase in street people 
in 198182 you almost didnt see homeless families he says 
now all of a sudden family shelters are bursting at the seams 
and i dont see any program coming along thats going to get these 
people out of the situation they are in 
tanya freeman a 40yearold grandmother suffers from hearing 
impairment heart disease epilepsy and shortness of breath she 
first met greene at a shelter in july after she moved to florida 
from the bronx in new york city 
i was raped and beaten and they helped me she says i had 
no place to go now im in school studying electronics i volunteer 
at the soup kitchen and im getting a healthy body back 
they let me feel comfortable ever since i met them my life is 
going up up up and i refuse to let it go back

until nbcs la law came along blair 
underwood wondered if he was destined to play gang leaders the rest 
of his career 
i was 22 years old and thats all i was playing underwood 
says i was a street kid on the soap opera one life to live a 
parolee in the primetime series downtown 
then i was cast as attorney jonathan rollins in la law 
young arrogant harvardeducated and black its funny now all 
people see me as a man in a suit and tie 
underwoods character was first conceived as an entertainment 
lawyer but that idea was dropped 
the closest hes gotten to that is defending a ventriloquist 
he says the ventriloquist had trouble communicating with people 
and talked through his dummy he had attacked a policeman because 
the cop had attacked his dummy which is an extension of himself 
the judge let him go 
ive been doing a lot of courtroom work this year my character 
hasnt had a personal life until the last four episodes they 
brought in a love interest renee jones whos a law clerk at the 
firm shes new and going through a divorce the way we ended the 
season is that weve decided to become friends and take it slowly 
lawyer rollins has also taken a few lumps during the past season 
it was a blow to jonathans ego when the law firm sent in jimmy 
smits to help out in a case he says hed gotten in over his 
head jimmy told him to calm down the jury was looking at him like 
he was a monster hed been bullying witnesses and losing sight of 
the case and his clients interests 
the case involved a woman suing a company because the boss 
pressured employees to go rock climbing her husband had fallen off 
and was killed jonathan was able to turn himself around and 
apologize for getting sidetracked he ended up winning the case 
underwood finishing his second year as the cocky lawyer is 
currently playing civil rights worker james chaney who with mickey 
schwerner and andrew goodman was murdered near philadelphia miss 
in 1964 
the movie murder in mississippi tells of the events leading 
up to the killings by white supremacists the aftermath is told in 
the theatrical movie mississippi burning 
underwood was born in tacoma wash but grew up mostly in 
virginia his father was an army officer so his early years were 
also spent in colorado michigan kansas and west germany he 
received his degree in theater arts from carnegie mellon university 
underwood has set up his own production company to create 
projects for himself his brother frank underwood jr a writer is 
putting some of the movies together 
you have to create your own screenplays to play the kind of 
parts you want to play he says were working on a western in 
which i would play a cowboy were also developing a major epic 
about hannibal the carthaginian who brought the elephants over the 
alps to attack rome 
underwood calls la law a great comfort zone because it 
allows him to say no to projects he doesnt really want to do he 
doesnt have to take them to make a living 
it was different three years ago he says you never know 
how your careers going to take off but its a good feeling to be 
able to say no to things 
there are very few shows that tap into reality involving blacks 
like la law or the cosby show writers dont always write for 
blacks or write realistically for them every black or hispanic 
isnt low income i wouldnt object to playing a street kid again 
but it would have to be a good role 
he has appeared in several feature and television films and on 
various tv series in guest star roles he spent three months on the 
soap opera one life to live as street kid bobby blue 
i get annoyed when people say ive been lucky underwood 
says there was a lot of hard work and a lot of risk taking

when debbie shapiro won a tony award for jerome 
robbins broadway last month she screamed parked her chewing gum 
with husband beau gravitte ran to the stage of the luntfontanne 
theater and fell apart 
im not prepared at all because i didnt want to tempt the 
gods she burbled to an enthusiastic audience 
i want to thank jerry robbins for letting me be whatever i 
am she continued i still havent figured it out 
the tony may help miss shapiro is blessed with what broadway 
veterans call a big voice the kind of lung power that used to 
stop shows when performers rather than elaborate scenery got most of 
the applause 
in jerome robbins broadway a collection of musical numbers 
from some of the famed directors biggest hits miss shapiro shares 
the stage with more than 60 other singers and dancers she still 
manages to stand out 
it could be the way she belts her way through ya got me from 
on the town or her funny pouty contribution to america from 
west side story or her backbreaking trumpet playing in you 
gotta have a gimmick from gypsy 
more likely its her stunning solo of a littleknown irving 
berlin song mr monotony a number cut from his miss 
liberty and call me madam and never heard on broadway until 
now 
she worked on the song for a long time the extended rehearsal 
process for jerome robbins broadway is already legendary no 
other recent musical has had such a painstaking and lengthy period 
of auditions reconstruction of lost dance numbers and rehearsal 
miss shapiros audition back in march of last year lasted two 
and a half days she learned nine songs including several like 
dreams come true and i can cook too that never made it to 
opening night and two dance numbers 
jerry was extremely warm she says of the audition the 
first day there was a room full of happy people it was one of those 
magical moments i did four songs and then i went and learned a 
dance and a scene it was happy happy happy 
she was told mr robbins would like to see you again 
but the next day everyone was miserable miserable 
miserable she recalls except jerry 
after five more songs another dance and another scene or two 
the master was satisfied but it wasnt until may that she knew she 
had the role her rehearsals began in august even though the show 
didnt open until february 
miss shapiro savors the success of jerome robbins broadway 
which finally fulfills the promise that started more than 20 years 
ago in los angeles 
at age 13 miss shapiro used to watch her best friend sing and 
then say to herself i think i can do that she did her first 
show the pajama game the following year at a local community 
theater and didnt stop 
i was always into theater songs and standards she says i 
still am when i first got to new york i worked in a ramada inn in 
darien connecticut trying to sing pop songs these people didnt 
know what to make of me nobody wanted to dance and buy booze they 
just wanted to listen 
miss shapiro had headed east in 1977 at the suggestion of 
choreographer tony stevens and musical director jack lee who worked 
with her in a california production of annie get your gun she 
went into spotlight a musical starring gene barry but the 
musical died during its washington tryout 
i had no idea that if you do a broadway show that it might not 
come to new york she says 
six months later she joined the chorus of theyre playing our 
song also understudying star lucie arnaz for a year she left to 
go into swing another broadwaybound show that didnt get past 
washington 
new yorkers finally noticed her in perfectly frank a revue 
featuring the songs of broadway composer frank loesser although she 
stopped the show and earned a love letter from the new york times 
critic audiences had to look quickly the show lasted 16 
performances 
but she never thought of leaving new york 
i did have a period of frustration she recalls i had 
finished doing a revival of zorba and a lot of stuff where i just 
sang i had a problem with people thinking i couldnt speak and my 
answer to them is when people sing its just talking but holding 
the notes that was always upsetting to me 
in 1986 she married gravitte an actor now in the cbs sitcom 
doctor doctor and went to los angeles with him she got a role 
in a shortlived television series trial and error 
i just talked and didnt sing she says it was so easy to 
do i had forgotten when i started doing jerome robbins how hard 
the theater is 
not only is the show physically demanding but there is no place 
backstage at the imperial theater to relax 
there are 120 people running around back there when i was in 
theyre playing our song which also was in the imperial i was in 
the chorus and i had my own dressing room now im finally starring 
on broadway but there are three of us in one room she says 
miss shapiro shares a dressing room with faith prince and susann 
fletcher each plays a variety of roles in the show but all three 
are strippers in the you gotta have a gimmick number 
susann was not nominated for a tony which was somewhat of a 
shock and faith was so it was a little bit awkward with faith and 
a little bit awkward with susann it was weird and it could have 
been a lot worse but we were all pretty sane about it in the end

older americans will associate brazilian music 
with carmen miranda whose trademark was a headdress that looked 
like an overflowing bowl of fruit younger ones will recall the 
girl from ipanema and bossa nova of the early 1960s carmen 
miranda and the girl from ipanema are still a part of brazilian 
music but theres much more to it these days and it has americans 
swaying more than ever to its beat an ap correspondent who worked 
2 years in brazil and now is assigned to new york traces the 
musics evolution from colonial times to the present

brazils melodious blend of african portuguese and native indian 
rhythms is seducing american ears and pop stars such as david 
byrne paul simon and sting noted for discovering new sounds are 
looking southward 
but hard to capture in the brazilianinspired american tunes and 
the compilations are the cultural and political roots of brazilian 
music which stretches from throbbing samba to the softer bossa 
nova some of brazils top singercomposers were jailed or exiled 
for their allegorical ballads during the 21year military 
dictatorship that ended in 1985 
three months ago byrne of the us rock group the talking heads 
released an anthology of brazilian music from the 1970s beleza 
tropical which has sold 100000 copies he is putting together 
two others a compilation of carnival samba and another of swinging 
syncopated forro from brazils northeast 
byrne and simon have made pilgrimages to the northeast state of 
bahia the source of brazilianafrican rhythms sting has traveled 
in the brazilian amazon region studying indian music and ceremonies 
brazilian singers caetano veloso and djavan have made names for 
themselves in the united states and recently recorded new albums on 
american labels milton nascimento gal costa and hermeto paschoal 
have just completed us tours to wide critical acclaim 
singersongwriter gilberto gil began a us tour in late june 
record producer quincy jones recently described the new interest 
in the music of brazil as the second wave the first was bossa 
nova which saxophonist stan getz helped bring to the united states 
in his jazz samba records of the early 1960s 
byrne said he sees a new openness among the american 
thirtysomething generation to foreign sounds and lyrics that 
arent necessarily in english 
theyre not very interested in guns and roses or michael 
jackson and theres little else byrne said referring to the 
heavy rock band and us light pop star they like things that 
seem genuine not a contrived commodity 
larry gold of the new york nightclub sounds of brazil agrees he 
said since the barriers fell between black rap and carribean sound 
and what was considered white music the american public has 
opened to regional sounds ticket sales at his 300seat club are up 
30 percent over last year he said 
though some fear the new interest in brazilian music will lead to 
a more generic international sound in brazil gilberto gil 
disagrees 
i think the new curiosity will bring out more of the 
complexities and contradictions in the music he said 
brazil a mixedrace nation of 141 million was colonized by the 
portuguese and now has 55 million people of african descent about 
220000 native indians live mostly in remote amazon regions 
the music reflects brazil said morton marx an american 
musicologist who has studied brazilian music 
much of brazilian music has been characterized as swing and its 
lightness is often confused with american easylistening music 
but as byrne points out many of brazils top singercomposers went 
to jail or were sent into exile for their work 
its melodious yet theres a sense of depth byrne said 
its very innovative and theres an acceptance of anything it 
reinforces the basic notion of throwing out the rule book 
beyond the melody much of brazilian pop integrates the 
rudimentary percussion instruments used in afrobrazilian spirit 
cults such as wooden drums known as atabaques a threebell 
instrument called an agogo and something similar to maraca 
rattles used by chacha bands 
at the same time the harmonic tones of milton nascimento and 
freewheeling improvisation of instrumentalists such as hermeto 
pascoal long have inspired jazz musicians pat metheney and miles 
davis among others 
the melange of peoples economic hardship and a history of 
government repression in brazil have created the innovations in 
structure lyrics and arrangements of its music 
in coastal bahia the rhythms are heavily african brought by the 
36 million slaves who came from western africa to work on the 
sugar cotton and coffee plantations and later to mine for gold and 
diamonds in brazil slavery spanned three centuries from the 1500s 
through abolition in 1888

in the northeastern interior where the cattle ranges were vast 
and there was less need for slave labor the music forro is of 
european descent brought by the portuguese owners the accordion is 
central to the swinging improvisational style that is now the 
principal musical form of the northeastern poor their dance is 
similar to a quadrille a square dance of french origin 
but it is perhaps black african culture that has survived in its 
purest form in the vast nation 
the portuguese crown encouraged plantation owners to keep 
together slaves from the same tribes hoping this would prevent a 
larger binding of blacks as a result tribes were able to preserve 
their own rituals religions dance and music 
some of brazils bestknown and most creative singers and 
musicians are from bahia including caetano veloso gilberto gil and 
bossa nova great joao gilberto among many others 
in rio de janeiro samba the music of the urban poor is rooted 
in the rhythmic drumming and dances used in african spirit religions 
such as candomble samba like the african religions once was 
repressed as backward 
but in the 1930s and 1940s president getulio vargas promoted 
nationalist sentiment to compliment stateled industrial growth he 
encouraged samba as uniquely brazilian and promoted carnival 
parades which began to feature themes in brazilian history 
white middleclass brazilians traditionally looked to the united 
states and europe for their music 
it wasnt until the late 1950s and early 1960s that samba stepped 
from the hillside slums and toward the musical mainstream with bossa 
nova 
antonio carlos jobim vinicius de moraes and joao gilberto 
combined a slow soft samba with jazz tones and relied heavily on 
strings and piano such songs as the girl from ipanema and 
dindi hit the international scene 
but only in the 1960s when brazil staggered under a military 
government that seized power in 1964 was samba firmly incorporated 
into the musical mainstream 
the country looked for a form of popular expression and turned to 
protest singers such as chico buarque de hollanda veloso and gil 
who wrote allegorical lyrics on political themes in an effort to to 
get around censorship they also picked up the songs of traditional 
samba composers such as noel rosa and jorge ben 
the music itself became a political statement it integrated 
samba and native indian wind pipes and rattles to illustrate an 
acceptance of brazils african and indian origins 
samba which had been popular just once a year at carnival was 
showcased year round 
many singercomposers such as veloso and gil were imprisoned then 
forced into exile 
the years 196768 saw the flowering of tropicalismo led 
principally by gil and veloso who incorporated international 
instruments such as electric guitars into the new national music 
today the music almost universally reflects disillusion with 
brazils civilian government that most feel has not responded 
effectively to the poverty in which 60 percent of the population 
lives or to the effects on the masses of the nations 115 billion 
foreign debt inherited from 21 years of military rule 
new albums by buarque de hollanda veloso and nascimento who 
have remained at the forefront of the musical scene capture that 
pessimistic spirit 
in the album in yauarete released last year on a cbs label 
the lyrics of nascimentos carta a republica letter to the 
republic perhaps best illustrates the deception 
yes its true life is freer and fear no longer lives in homes 
in bars in streets but i cant hide a bitterness at seeing the 
dream slip backward 
the end of the military government saw the rise of a new 
generation of directly political and angry brazilian rock musicians 
singers such as pepeu gomes lobao palaramas do successo legiao 
urbana and cazuza sing about contemporary ills pollution aids and 
destruction of the brazilian rain forests 
cazuza who is dying of aids describes his guitar as a machine 
gun of resentment

across asia these days a us college education has 
become a ticket to the top 
national leaders with american college or university degrees 
include president corazon aquino of the philippines president lee 
tenghui of taiwan and prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan 
they also include rene saquisaq a us student in the 1960s who 
turned down a highpaying job in law and now is the poorest but most 
popular member of the philippines senate because of his activism 
and satyen g pitroda an indian electronics engineer who sold off a 
multimilliondollar electronics company in the united states to 
return home to help prime minister rajiv gandhi modernize indias 
telecommunications system for a government salary of one rupee 6 
cents a year 
asian students who stay in the united states after graduation are 
recognized as helping to keep american standards up in science and 
technology fields especially favored by students from china and 
india 
many more of asias brightest are in the usbound pipeline 
the new wealth of many asian countries enables governments and 
parents to pay the fastrising tuition room and board at american 
universities approaching 20000 a year for ivy league and similar 
schools and at the same time add significantly to the revenues of 
the american institutions 
asians are drawn to american campuses partly by the availability 
of places partly by growing consciousness of membership in the 
pacific rim community partly by admiration for the us higher 
education system 
atsuko matsumoto 24 said she hadnt been forced to study hard 
for her degree at yokohama city college and hoped for more 
stimulation in an advanced american business course she already has 
been to an intensive english course at spring hill college in 
mobile ala 
i heard that american university students study very hard so i 
think its good to go to school there ms matsumoto said 
thumbing through university catalogs in the office of the 
japanunited states educational commission 
the offices library was jammed with young japanese exploring 
course listings or paying 1000 yen about 7 for a 90page 
handbook on how to get ready for an american university education 
its a scene mirrored many places in asia as youth in the heavily 
populated arc from pakistan to china plan their schooling some 
intend to return home after us study some stay in the united 
states for highpaying jobs or research that cannot be done at home 
others seek to leave behind forever the deprivation or oppression or 
political uncertainty in their homelands 
soon after the dust settled in beijing following the massacre of 
prodemocracy demonstrators young people braved watchful police and 
lined up at us consulates in chinese cities to apply for student 
visas 
they face many barriers especially if they need the government 
financing that is given to 35000 of the 80000 chinese studying 
abroad this year 
most chinese who are permitted to study abroad have to pass 
competitive tests also important are family connections relations 
in china who will ensure the students eventual return and being 
ideologically and morally sound in the words of rules issued in 
1987 
despite such barriers china had more students in the united 
states than any other country this year an estimated 40000 
one is jiang mian the son of chinas new community party leader 
jiang zemin he is completing work on a doctorate in electrical and 
computer engineering at drexel university in philadelphia where he 
has studied since 1986 and lives in a modest brick row house near 
the campus he declined to discuss his future with an ap reporter in 
philadelphia in late june 
the chinese government gives financial support mostly to graduate 
students in engineering and business returned students play a major 
role in advanced study within china accounting for 30 percent to 50 
percent of the teachers of postgraduate courses said yu fuzeng 
director of the state education commissions foreign affairs bureau 
in beijing 
in the 198788 school year asian students numbered 180500 or 
507 percent of all foreign students in the united states compared 
with 286 percent in 197980 according to statistics in a 
newsletter of the national association for foreign student affairs 
the academic year 198788 was the first in which asians were the 
majority of foreign students and asian countries held eight of the 
first 10 places in the ranking of nations with the most students in 
us colleges 
william k cummings director of the office of international 
education at the harvard graduate school of education wrote in the 
newsletter that one can reasonably anticipate continuing expansion 
of the asian appetite for overseas study 
many more may be from south korea which liberalized overseas 
travel in january and now permits anyone to apply for a passport 
the foreign ministry in seoul reports issuing 27000 passports to 
students this year 132 percent more than last year

the nationalist chinese government and 
party hierarchy have a distinct us background and this has been 
reflected in the more liberal policies of president lee tenghuis 
administration 
lee 66 who is also chairman of the nationalist party was 
educated at iowa state university at ames and cornell university in 
ithaca ny and 17 of the 25 members of his cabinet studied in the 
united states 
observers say time spent in the united states has made taiwans 
new leaders more pragmatic and liberal than the older generation of 
nationalist leaders who fled to taiwan in 1949 when they lost a 
civil war to the communists on the chinese mainland 
one of the new leaders regarded as the brightest is james soong 
47 secretary general of the party no 2 behind lee 
soong was educated at the university of california at berkeley 
and catholic university of america in washington dc before 
earning a doctorate in political science from georgetown university 
in the us capital 
his us education has made him bold to make reforms while most 
bureaucrats merely followed old practices to avoid backlashes from 
changes said kan yulung chairman of the china daily news kan 
spent five years as deputy to soong when the latter was director of 
the government information office which controls the media in 
taiwan 
insiders say soong when he was the partys deputy secretary 
general in 1987 encouraged lees predecessor chiang chingkuo to 
end 38 years of martial law and allow taiwanese and mainland chinese 
to exchange visits 
last year after chiang died soong risked his political career 
by rebuking the partys old guard for their reluctance to support 
lee chiangs handpicked successor as chairman of the nationalist 
party the party in the end made lee chairman 
soong son of a nationalist general has shunned interviews and 
maintained a low profile but this had not hurt his popularity he 
also has won over party elders 
he is a man of vitality who still retains many traditional 
chinese virtues such as modesty and respect to elders said kan

can dead bodies be funny alfred hitchcock thought so and in 
1955 he made a minor classic the trouble with harry harry 
being a murdered man nobody could get rid of 
one of the most sidesplitting sequences of tvs fawlty 
towers concerned john cleeses attempt to hide a guest who had 
checked out mortally at the hotel 
comedy corpses had less success in blake edwards sob 
with richard mulligan as the errant cadaver and wc fields and 
me in which fields and friends took the deceased john barrymore 
on a last tour of nightclubs it supposedly happened 
now comes weekend at bernies to prove that yes stiffs can 
be hilarious credit goes to the feathery direction of ted kotcheff 
fun with dick and jane a wildly improbable script by robert 
klane wheres poppa and the razorsharp work of two young 
farceurs andrew mccarthy and jonathan silverman 
mccarthy and silverman are ambitious young employees at a 
manhattan insurance company while preparing a moneymaking venture 
for the firm they uncover evidence of a complicated fraud scheme 
when the pair present their boss bernie with the discovery he 
suggests they join him for labor day weekend at his pleasure palace 
at the hamptons on long island what they dont know is that bernie 
has been running the scam with the help of the mafia 
mccarthy and silverman arrive at bernies and find him dead 
plugged by a hit man with pride in his job to save themselves the 
two must make it appear that bernie is still alive and well they 
somehow accomplish this at parties on streets and in boats 
thats about it except for a romantic sideplot with silverman 
and catherine mary stewart the office beauty but the interplay 
between the two young men and their late boss is enough to keep one 
helplessly laughing 
what keeps weekend at bernies from being a perfect comedy 
such as big is the sketchy characterization of the two leads 
mccarthy is an overbearing slob and silverman is so timid he cant 
ask the gorgeous stewart for a date both actors flawlessly handle 
the comedy too bad their roles werent better defined 
special credit must go to terry kiser as bernie playing dead 
through most of a feature movie is no joke and he admirably meets 
the challenge 
victor drai produced the 20th century fox release for gladden 
entertainment the rating is pg13 with some swearing and much 
macabre humor running time 100 minutes

the cocoanuts mca home video vhsbeta 1995 
 
dare we call a film starring the marx brothers with music and 
lyrics by irving berlin and with a book by george s kaufman a 
bore 
we dare 
the movie in question is the cocoanuts made in the infancy 
of the talk era 
now to the balance sheet 
no film with groucho marx could be all bad groucho who plays 
the proprietor of the hotel de cocoanut has an absolute 
monopoly on the funny moments in this spoof of the 1920s florida 
land boom 
he and chico do their classic why a duck bit and as usual 
groucho labors tirelessly and hilariously for the affections of 
margaret dumont the rich and available heiress in practically every 
marx brothers film 
you wouldnt love me if i was poor she protests 
i might but id keep my mouth shut replies groucho 
its also kind of fun to see the flapper costumes the women wore 
and hollywood historians can probably find all sorts of interest in 
how paralyzed cameramen and sound crews were at that time 
but beware of the long long long long music and dancing 
interludes every marx brothers film featured musical bits by chico 
and harpo as well as several songs by an annoying tenor facts 
that groucho himself often bemoaned 
in the cocoanuts the longforgotten oscar shaw the 
ostensible love interest sings and acts so ridiculously and 
badly that you will reach for your fastforward button it hardly 
seems possible to make berlin tunes sound rotten but shaw does it 
the choreography is unwatchable a kind of dopey callisthenics 
rather than dancing and not very strenuous at that 
this is definitely not a marx brothers picture to create new fans 
for the boys repeated viewing could even lose some old ones made 
in 1929 in living black and white

talk radio mca home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
talk radio eric bogosians dialogue with the depraved and 
the depressed as a talk show host is one hour and 40 minutes of 
compelling chatter 
he roves out loud through the ravages of his own twisted 
consciousness and the net effect leaves one feeling like he or she 
has scaled the tower of babel 
talk radio is oliver stones adaptation of bogosians oneact 
play of the same title about a provocative radio personality it 
also is based in part on the story of radio talk show host alan 
berg who was killed in 1984 by white supremacists 
bogosian goads his racist callers ridicules his fans and offers 
a sympathetic ear to the truly troubled his monologues build a 
frenetic pitch of words then stall for a gasp and then begin all 
over again 
the talk show format is anything goes so long as whats going is 
controversial a rapist calls to beg for help and describe his last 
attack antisemites reel off strings of jewhating epithets 
paranoids detail their convoluted fears including one woman who is 
obsessed with what shell find at the bottom of her garbage disposal 
much of movie itself in fact resembles the verbal equivalent of 
that goo and grime languishing in the dank crevices of a garbage 
disposal its humanity at its worst which leads bogosian to 
wistfully conclude i guess were stuck with each other 
its riveting for a while as voyeuristic thrills go but after 
the din dies the final sensation is exhaustion that and an intense 
desire to shower off all that scum

merv griffin made 250 million in 
one week 
cocacola offered to buy his production company and paid 250 
million in seven days he became a great american fortune for 
me and im sure for greatgreatgreat grandchildren if i dont 
blow the whole thing 
griffins transformation from band singer to talk show host to 
billionaire is one of the remarkable stories of show business it 
amazes him too the latest phase he admits is all due to a few tv 
game shows he concocted wheel of fortune and jeopardy 
those were the prizes for which cocacola paid all that money 
even with an empire that includes film and television companies 
the beverly hilton hotel resorts and casinos in the bahamas and 
atlantic city and four radio stations griffin still yearns to sing 
with a band he was to do just that over the fourth of july weekend 
at his resorts international in atlantic city 
you know something he muses exactly 40 years ago i played 
the atlantic city steel pier with freddy martins band we appeared 
before 150000 people over the july 4th weekend 
how much was i getting lets see i started with freddy at 
125 then got a raise to 150 when i had a hit record with ive 
got a lovely bunch of coconuts he raised me to 200 
griffin 64 talked about a variety of matters during a lunch at 
his regular table in mr hs the beverly hilton restaurant he is a 
bit stouter than in his talkshow days its a constant battle 
but he spoke just as ebulliently as when he was questioning authors 
about their new selfhelp books 
he gazed with pride at the swimming pool area that had once 
looked like a motel with its allweather carpet now it resembled an 
oasis with lush greenery griffin also was adding a small forest on 
the wilshire boulevard frontage and everywhere in the hotel signs 
of change could be seen 
i have the most valuable property in beverly hills nine acres 
in the best location he said i had an offer two weeks ago from 
the japanese i said no thanks i havent finished it yet 
the merv griffin show went off the air in 1986 after 23 
years and he devoted his attention to his busy production company 
then the cocacola buyout provided a shower of cash that was almost 
but not quite embarrassing 
i called arthur laffer who was largely responsible for mr 
reagans economic program griffin said arthur told me spread 
it around merv some in treasury bonds a little in the stock 
market a little in this he sent a lot of people to me and i 
chose the ones i liked 
i did all that and i was never so bored in my life first of 
all they dont come and pile the money on a desk so you dont 
know you got it they call and say they wired it to your bank they 
wired my bank and the computer broke down then they roll it over 
and you get interest statements and all that 
i said im not going to sit and do this for the rest of my 
life thats when barron hilton said merv do you wanna buy the 
beverly hilton i couldnt believe it 
i had a little tussle with the japanese they topped my offer 
by a lot but then they had their black monday the same time we did 
so they pulled out and i went back with my original offer 102 
million 
then came the battle with donald trump over possession of resorts 
international in the end they settled the dispute with griffin 
getting most of resorts except for the unfinished taj mahal in 
atlantic city 
griffin who doesnt seem to get mad at anybody has mellowed in 
his relationship to trump 
were not buddies we dont talk on the phone every day said 
griffin we speak through our representatives but we get along 
fine his goals are a bit different from mine hes a young man and 
he must constantly let the crowd out there perceive that he has won 
on everything hes only here on earth to win 
thats ok because thats the business hes in i am not in 
that same business i buy what i enjoy 
griffin reported gleefully that he and trump will join in a 
mutual enterprise as judges in the miss america pageant well 
both vote for each other 
the golden touch of merv griffin will soon fall on another tv 
game show based on monopoly the venerable board game that uses 
street and place names of atlantic city pilot programs have been 
produced under his supervision 
its so funny he said on the show we move these little 
red houses around on boardwalk and north carolina and connecticut 
avenue in real life i own them anyway

the light playing off the glass entryway to the new 
national gallery of canada was dazzling as photographer yousuf karsh 
arrived for his first glimpse of the largest retrospective ever 
prepared of his work 
no two mornings are alike the 80yearold photographer 
observed 
given the choice of taking an elevator or walking up the ramp 
full of light and shadow karsh started walking without hesitation 
this after all is a man who describes his craft with such words 
as dedication curiosity responsibility and challenge then adds 
that none of it should be evident 
the human face is the great challenge in the world karsh 
said conducting the interview as he toured the gallery i never 
tire of it and everyone is different 
he described his recent trip to photograph pakistani prime 
minister benazir bhutto as enthusiastically as his recollections of 
getting winston churchill to pose in 1941 
its still to date my greatest diplomatic triumph karsh said 
of the session nearly half a century ago that ended up on the cover 
of life magazine and clinched his reputation 
the photo of a defiant churchill appealed to the whole world 
he said it caught all the bulldog determination of the british 
empire it was done without premeditation but with great 
admiration and respect 
the portraits of the rich talented powerful and famous 
certainly are the most prominent among the 198 photographs on 
display at the national gallerys main exhibition space through 
september but the retrospective shows that karsh has other 
interests as well 
this is a very tender picture he said stopping at a 
photograph for a commissioned faces of canada series taken at a 
hospital in edmonton alberta in 1952 she was just a sick lady 
but look at the serenity of that face 
karsh said the idea that he only photographed celebrities is 
totally wrong because i have photographed the people who are less 
famous for all of my life 
closest to the entrance to the exhibit are photos taken for 
muscular dystrophy fundraising campaigns a special interest of 
recent years and virtually the only ones he has taken not on 
assignment or commission 
the retrospective at the yearold national gallery takes on 
additional significance because it is just blocks away from karshs 
studio in ottawas landmark chateau laurier hotel 
the studio features karsh trademark photos in its foyer the 
writer ernest hemingway churchill the artist georgia okeeffe and 
cellist pablo casals 
the photographer described his living situation as ideal being 
able to maintain a home in peaceful ottawa while traveling the world 
on his assignments 
karsh is from an armenian family that fled turkey in 1922 he 
came to canada two years later where he joined an uncle who was a 
photographer although karsh originally planned to become a doctor 
by 1932 he had opened his first ottawa photography studio 
his training was to photograph using available light but 
involvement with the ottawa little theater taught him to use studio 
lighting to create a mood as a result the lighting is often 
dramatic in his photographs 
he said he preferred to photograph his subjects as much as 
possible in their own environment 
the question is to know as much about the people as possible 
to do your homework in advance and to listen he said you have 
to have true understanding of the subject you photograph 
karshs advice also is to be a student of the humanities to 
learn about history music art and travel all this allows you to 
be a more sensitive recorder of what you are doing he said 
the actual moment of taking a photograph he said becomes 
intuitive more than anything else you dont have time to analyze 
as he sat at the exhibition before his portraits of a young fidel 
castro and author vladimir nabokov to have his own picture taken 
karsh asked to be involved in conversation to be provoked so that 
more action and expression could be captured 
the cuban president he said is never tiresome nabokov was 
a beautiful sensitive colorful writer but as a human being hes 
not my number one choice 
karshs wife estrellita travels with him and had memories of 
her own on seeing the photographs hanging at the national gallery 
artist man ray was so wonderful the artist joan miro gradually 
relaxed as he sat in the paris studio where he did lithographs and 
the manifestations of a famous artist faded into the kindly man seen 
in his portrait 
estrellita karsh stopped for a moment in front of the 1946 
photograph of a young spectacularly beautiful ingrid bergman 
was she that gorgeous yousof she asked jeepers 
yes she was karsh quietly replied about the late actress

chris isaaks dark and dreamlike music has 
long been a hit with audiences in the san francisco area but 
national fame and a spot on the pop charts have eluded him 
a hit single would be swell says the 32yearold singer and 
songwriter but its not the most important thing 
i like to sing if i had a hit thatd be great isaak says 
id be really overjoyed to have a hit tickled pink but im not 
worried about that im more worried about just keeping my job 
maybe hes not a household word but isaak has a solid reputation 
as someone who borrows the best from countrywestern and rock n 
roll to produce an original sound 
his newly released album heart shaped world is more upbeat 
than earlier efforts and possibly his best guitarist james wilsey 
adds a polished heavily tremoloed background to isaaks 
velvetysoft vocals 
wilsey is largely responsible for the sound that has grabbed the 
attention of critics he has a sharp ear for what works with isaaks 
lyrics but he says a sophisticated computer system is partly 
responsible for the sound he achieves on stage 
this is the bands third album since 1985 and the third time 
observers have said isaak is teetering on the edge of national 
acclaim 
but the man often compared to roy orbison and elvis presley two 
of his many idols has a hard time being serious when describing the 
new album 
this is pretty much me singing a bunch of songs i wrote just 
like the first two albums he said if you liked the first two 
albums this is pretty much the same route if you didnt like the 
first two albums this is all different 
if isaak in person was like the isaak in his music one would 
probably meet a somewhat somber person dressed in black his songs 
often speak of lost or nearly lost love one imagines the 
songwriter sitting in an unlighted room peering out a window at a 
grimy predawn city street 
but the inperson isaak is a regular cutup the stockton 
calif native talks with a slightly goofy rural california accent 
which disappears when he sings and gets a kick out of telling 
stories like the one about how he learned to play guitar by 
sneaking into his older brothers room 
nick isaak had told his younger brother to stay away from his 
prized instrument 
every day it was forbidden but hed go to school and id play 
his guitar id put it back exactly where it belonged the singer 
said one day i was sitting there watching tv i had put the 
guitar back and the string just popped theyll do that sometimes 
i heard it go brrroooiing i thought id been playing it but i 
wasnt playing it right now 
he worked me over pretty good for that one 
then theres the one about how he acquired his first guitar the 
silvertone hes played on all three albums and the inspiration for 
his first bands name hed been eyeballing it every day as he 
walked by a local pawnshop finally he asked his brother for help 
my brother was better at arguing on prices so i said why 
dont you go see if you can get a deal so he called the fire 
department and told them the pawn shop was a fire hazard so they 
had to get rid of a bunch of stuff 
he bought the guitar for 80 
we didnt like the people at that pawn shop anyway theyd 
sold my mother a single guitar string for 4 isaak said 
fans are familiar with isaaks brand of humor he often 
introduces songs with long whimsical tales involving members of the 
band he drives a 1964 nova at a recent record release party at the 
fairmont hotel he showed up in a floralpatterned suit made from 
window drapes 
and for some undisclosed reason isaak thinks tikis are neat he 
keeps dozens of the polynesian idols big and small on his dining 
room table and in his kitchen he even owns a painting of a tiki an 
awful thing that looks like it might have been drawn under the 
influence of mescaline 
but the zaniness doesnt carry over into the music 
isaak has always thought of his style as countrywestern 
however numerous influences are apparent including rockabilly and 
rhythm and blues 
i try not to make things that are too angrysounding he 
said it makes me nervous when i hear music that is just people 
banging away if i listen to it its got to be pretty like bing 
crosby 
i dont like people who cant sing but say ill make records 
despite that fact 
critics often speak of the dark side of isaaks music one deejay 
in washington dubbed him the baron of brood and singles such as 
you owe me some kind of love off his second lp and wicked 
ways off the new album exemplify that lonelier side 
as a young man living in stockton a place he describes as 
fresno without all the glitter isaak attended the university of 
pacific and took up boxing but like early ideas of being a 
filmmaker the boxing career petered out he went to japan as a 
transfer student and spent much of his time singing and playing the 
guitar 
isaak came to san francisco in 1980 and later hooked up with erik 
jacobsen who produced his albums and eventually became his manager 
until he met wilsey isaak was the lead guitarist in his band 
jimmy and i met in 1982 i had a threepiece band and he said 
hey let me in i can play guitar better than that 
wilsey who started out running the sound system for isaaks 
first band said he was immediately taken with the budding singer 
i realized he was the funniest person id ever met it was nice 
to hang around him and laugh when other things seemed depressing 
wilsey said 
aside from the music isaak has enjoyed a successful sideline 
career as a film actor hes appeared in two episodes of the tv show 
private eye and had a cameo in jonathan demmes married to the 
mob

as a columnist for the new york times and a 
pulitzer prizewinning author russell baker has settled into a 
comfortable way of life 
no more cruising the streets of baltimore in search of crime 
stories no coronations to cover no waiting in the halls of 
congress for politicians to lie to him 
he and his wife mimi have a home of their own now in leesburg 
va just what his mother dreamed of when she raised him during the 
great depression baker has stuck with journalism for more than 40 
years always remembering his mothers advice to never be a quitter 
to make something of himself 
but he still has some unfinished business growing up the 
bestselling account of his childhood ended in the late 1940s with 
his marraige and his early days with the baltimore sun 
in a summer of sequels on the big screen baker continues his 
life story with the good times 1995 morrow 
this book was inevitable after growing up he said i was 
amazed at the mail i had received and still receive so many people 
led the same life 
memoirs are by famous men and cast light on great events these 
are more letters to my family 
baker was just another rewrite man and police reporter at the 
sun horrified at the hopeless poverty he had witnessed in the slums 
of baltimore when buck dorsey the managing editor phoned and 
invited him to lunch at the posh chesapeake restaurant 
after several martinis dorsey stunned his young employee by 
offering the assignment of london bureau chief 
i really dont know why he did it baker said ive got 
some guesses just guesses buck was a gambling man all real 
baltimoreans are gamblers he picked me out as somebody to bet on 
he was sort of running me testing his eye 
the london experience changed my life it gave me an education 
humanized me exposed me to theater ballet and music a few weeks 
earlier i had been writing stories about purse snatching now im 
covering winston churchill and anthony eden being briefed by john 
foster dulles 
the good times is a book of turning points a chronicle of 
unexpected breaks baker puts himself back in the mind of the 
ordinary man astonished at his own good fortune 
i wanted to get inside the skin of how events are happening at 
the time if i wrote it as an essay now as an old granddad looking 
back it wouldnt be the same i wanted to convey the sense of what 
was going on as a youngster 
i was like somebody thrown into swirling water i was just 
swimming i didnt have any sense of going any place i was 
learning and it was fascinating 
after returning to the united states in 1954 baker was hired by 
the new york times and served as a correspondent in washington 
unlike his colleagues however he didnt concern himself with 
the differences between democrats and republicans instead he 
studied personalities and was fascinated by lyndon johnson then the 
senates powerful majority leader 
he was a million things it was like peeling an onion he could 
tell you a story and reduce himself to tears then he could turn on 
you with a snarl he was one of the great mysteries baker said 
of all the politicians i covered he was the one character that 
would have interested shakespeare sometimes hes like king lear 
then hes like macbeth then hes a buffoon like falstaff 
baker also found himself oddly attracted to richard nixon then 
vice president under president eisenhower like baker the gloomy 
awkward nixon grew up poor and struggled to advance himself 
john f kennedy was a rich mans son he had been a hero in 
world war ii everything had come easy to him i could identify with 
nixon he had suffered and was terribly scarred by the experience i 
could feel for him i could sympathize for him but it was almost 
impossible to like him baker said 
but presidents and congressmen never interested baker the way 
writers did for a man whose heroes included ernest hemingway and 
eb white the intrigues of washington never entirely consumed him 
by 1962 he knew his days as a reporter were numbered that a 
leisurely lunch meant more to him than any senate subcommittee when 
the sun asked him to write for their editorial page the times 
topped it giving baker the observer column he still has today 
when i went to london for the sun baker recalled once a 
week there was a column we had called from a window in fleet 
street the home of newspapers in london 
that was my first experience at writing a column i discovered 
i liked it it was a wonderful release from the rigors of objective 
reporting i could deal with character and color 
baker has no plans for a russell baker iii or sequel to his 
lifes story 
im just a columnist now nothing happens to me anymore 
baker said nothing ever happens to a columnist they just 
ossify

ok buckaroos and buckarettes return 
with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear when cowboys rode 
into the sunset in a wild untamed land 
riders in the sky a buckskin singing trio have rejuvenated the 
western radio serial with their weekly riders radio theater on 100 
national public radio stations 
for 30 minutes each week the three sing such western tunes as 
tumbling tumbleweed perform zany skits and present serials with 
old west and contemporary themes 
weve staked out a patch of range on the airwaves says 
ranger doug who calls himself the idol of american youth 
ranger doug who really is douglas green is joined by cowboy 
cohorts woody paul the king of the cowboy fiddlers and too 
slim bassist and mercantilist supreme 
the gunslingers and desperadoes dont stand a chance against 
these guys 
i think were bringing back a tradition that had been forgotten 
for the last 25 or 30 years said too slim who is fred labour in 
real life 
taped in nashville in the format of an oldtime radio show the 
program has become one of the most popular on public radio since 
garrison keillors prairie home companion 
the show which airs in canada and australia besides the united 
states just won awards from the corporation for public broadcasting 
for technical achievement and general music 
commercial radio stations are beginning to sign up for the 
program as well 
this is a real breakthrough said woody paul who really is 
paul woodrow chrisman he has a doctorate in physics from 
massachusetts institute of technology but would rather earn his 
living playing the fiddle 
playing cowboy has enabled him and his faithful sidekicks to do 
battle against the villainous slocum their arch enemy on the show 
since its premiere last october 
in a continuining saga titled meltdown on the mesa slocum 
and other bunkhouse badmen tried to use a nuclear reactor against 
prairie dogs they attempted to buy off the good guys by generously 
offering a condominium 
the trio got able assistance from sidemeat their devoted trail 
cook who bakes biscuits referred to as the hardest substance known 
to man 
another show fixture is the announcer bix bender the voice 
that sold a million baby chicks 
but the program is more than humor the trio sing with pristine 
precision while playing acoustic guitar fiddle and standup bass 
several people say its the fastest halfhour in radio 
ranger doug said 
the three all around 40 years old say the show has developed a 
cult following 
there are people who know the plots and want to discuss them 
too slim said they miss a week and want to know what happened 
some people make up their own plots and send them in like sidemeat 
and the beanstalk 
they write long literate letters about the show he said 
the public radio audience is quick and appreciative when you do a 
quality show 
the trio have been donning 10gallon hats kerchiefs and faded 
chaps to sing their western music for more than 10 years they 
perform regularly on the grand ole opry and were hosts of a western 
movie show tumbleweed theater for three seasons on the 
nashville network on cable tv 
they have recorded about a dozen albums including the current 
riders go commercial they were in the movie sweet dreams 
about the life of country star patsy cline and in the kenny rogers 
tv movie wild horses 
they also were favorites on prairie home companion 
the trio believe they have filled a void by representing western 
heroes for youngsters for the past few years kids have embraced 
such characters as luke skywalker han solo indiana jones and now 
batman as their heroes instead of such buckskin baritones as tex 
ritter who were idolized by their parents the three said 
they just dont know any singing cowboys ranger doug said 
a kid age 7 doesnt even know roy rogers they know he man and 
batman 
a key to the show has been its family orientation 
were in an age where there is not a lot of mass popular 
culture that parents feel comfortable enjoying with their 
children ranger doug said riders radio theater has something 
for everybody 
for woody paul his role fulfills a childhood ambition 
i dreamed of playing a cowboy when i was a kid and here i am 
he said i ask the kids at the concerts what they want to be when 
they grow up and they say they dont know i say i dont know 
either

italys largest chemical and agroindustrial 
group on monday announced plans to produce and market a new 
biodegradable plastic made from corn starch 
the ferruzzi group which controls the chemical giant montedison 
said the biodegradable plastic will be used initially to make 
plastic bags packing and napkins 
we are studying the market sectors to which the new plastic 
could fit said amilcare collina head of montedisons research 
division production of the biodegradable plastic would be started 
next year it would initially amount to a few million tons a year 
collina said that the major chemical groups worldwide are 
studying and developing new brands of biodegradable plastic but as 
far as we know our brand derived from starch should be the first 
ever of its kind 
ferruzzi experts said the biodegradable plastic will be more 
costly than the plastic currently used for bags and packing but did 
not cite any figures 
collina also said that the production of corn starch will be 
increased as a result of the ferruzzi group venture however he 
said he could not immediately estimate how much maize corn 
cultivation would have to increase to meet higher demands for corn 
starch 
ferruzzi also has interests in cereals and controls italys 
largest sugar concern eridania 
the groups plan for the biodegradable plastic comes amid growing 
protests by environmentalists over the use of plastic materials and 
an italian government decision to levy a tax on plastic bags 
as a result the price of plastic bags in italian supermarkets 
soared to 170 lire 12 us cents from 50 lire 35 cents paper 
bags sell for 150 lire 107 cents

by seven rigs this week to 817 marking the sixth straight weekly 
gain according to baker hughes inc 
the nationwide count increased by 15 last week a year ago the 
count totaled 921 baker hughes reported monday 
the companys rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil tool making company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states california saw the biggest gain 
with eight additional rigs followed by wyoming five oklahoma 
three colorado two and louisiana and ohio one each 
texas had the biggest drop with nine fewer rigs followed by

an increase in work on government projects rose 13 percent in may 
the government reported today 
the commerce department reported that spending on both public and 
private construction rose to a seasonally adjusted 4213 billion in 
may following a 08 percent drop in april and a 02 percent rise in 
march 
while public construction rose 67 percent in may to 862 
billion private construction remained flat at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 3351 billion the department said private 
construction had fallen 16 percent in march 
the construction industry has been among the sectors of the 
economy hardest hit recently by the federal reserves campaign to 
halt inflation by tightening credit and thus boosting interest rates 
mays spending level was 33 percent above the pace in may 1988 
spending on private nonresidential construction projects rose 
26 percent in may to an annual rate of 987 billion 
but construction of new housing units fell 25 percent to a

lin broadcasting corps board of directors has 
rejected as inadequate a 585 billion takeover offer from mccaw 
cellular communications inc and is calling on stockholders to do 
likewise the company said monday 
lin said its board concluded at a special meeting on saturday 
after conferring with financial advisors wasserstein perella amp co 
that the 120ashare offer was not in the best interest of 
shareholders 
lin originally decided on june 19 to reject the offer from 
mccaws parent mmm holdings inc and explore other alternatives 
lin which has interests in cellular telephones television and 
publishing said its alternatives included staying independent 
recapitalizing or selling itself to other potential buyers 
on friday lin lost a legal fight with metromedia co over lins 
claims to interests held by metromedia in cellular telephone 
companies in new york and philadelphia 
had lin prevailed over metromedia its stock value might have 
risen as much as 40 a share some analysts said a defeat they 
predicted could prompt mccaw to amend its offer 
lins stock price tumbled 712 a share on friday to 11587 in 
national overthecounter trading 
lin said monday that the company had rejected mccaws offer last 
month without taking the metromedia litigation into consideration 
some might assume we thought our stock was worth more than 120 
a share with the possible favorable outcome with metromedia said 
michael plouf a lin vice president we think it was worth more 
than 120 regardless of the metromedia litigation 
lin said further that mccaw had not received approval from the 
federal communications commission and state regulatory authorities 
to purchase lin common stock and had not obtained adequate financing 
james abernathy a spokesman for kirkland washbased mccaw 
said there was no new comment from the company after fridays 
ruling mccaw had said it was disappointed in the outcome of the 
litigation and would review the courts decision 
it also noted that mccaw reserved the right to amend its june 8 
offer which expires thursday in the event of adverse developments 
in the linmetromedia litigation

in the gogo days they said what happened to 
savings and loans in texas could never happen here 
highflying thrifts loaned millions on tracts of desert but 
arizona was different they thought land flipped from buyer to 
buyer at higher and higher prices sampls offered loans without down 
payments and some even made themselves partners in risky ventures 
even the oldest most conservative savings banks got caught up in 
the pandemonium 
but the multibilliondollar bust in texas the birthplace of the 
nations sampl crisis would never happen here they said 
it did 
five of the eight sampls based in the phoenix area are now 
insolvent and have been taken over by regulators the real estate 
market is in a free fall losses have run into the hundreds of 
millions of dollars each quarter estimates of the cost to taxpayers 
to clean up just the arizona thrifts climb up to 6 billion 
i think what happened in phoenix is very similar to what 
happened in texas said gene rice chairman of merabank arizonas 
largest thrift the market became overbuilt because of too much 
optimism in financial institutions and outoftown investors then 
when it collapsed everyone ran for a corner 
arizona added thrift analyst william ferguson appears headed 
in almost the exact direction texas went in the ratios look about 
the same 
experts say the collapse of the thrift industry in the grand 
canyon state far removed from the plunge in oil prices that helped 
trigger the texas debacle points out how pervasive the sampl crisis 
is and how few lessons the industry has learned from texas 
in arizona the worst is not over and in the end taxpayers will 
be stuck with a lot of tracts of dusty desert far outside phoenix 
to be sure the bill awaiting taxpayers for the arizona problem 
is only a fraction of the 50 billion to 75 billion tab for texas 
and experts say arizona didnt suffer as much fraud as the lone star 
state but on a percentage basis the arizona crisis actually looks 
worse than texas 
texas has 204 thrifts arizona has only 11 savings institutions 
based in the state five of them all in phoenix are insolvent 
according to the federal home loan bank board 
theres tremendous concentration in this market said bob 
stallings chairman of western savings who was recruited last 
spring from a dallas thrift im seeing some of the same problems 
here and in fact even worse 
repossessed assets at arizona thrifts have skyrocketed from 207 
million at the end of 1986 to 1 billion at the end of 1988 
regulatory capital a measure of the institutions solvency has 
plunged from 113 billion in 1986 to 343 million in 1988 earnings 
have reversed from a 110 million 1985 profit to a 657 million 1988 
loss with another 195 million loss in the first three months of 
this year 
and a recent poll in phoenix found that despite the governments 
100000 deposit insurance six of 10 consumers believed sampls were 
risky places for their savings 
arizona officials have gone to washington to ask for special 
consideration in the bush administrations sampl bailout plan and to 
plead for a guarantee the land wont be dumped at firesale prices 
regulators now control the bulk of thrifts real estate assets in 
arizona more than 10 billion worth 
the most important economic factor in arizona is what happens 
with the bush plan said state banking commissioner hank rivoir 
the regulators could kill arizonas economy for years to come 
or they could give us just a flesh wound 
like texas arizona has a liberal real estate law that allowed 
the risky sampl lending practices 
when texas was booming developers fueled with easytoget loans 
overbuilt and when oil turned down the market crashed in arizona 
an overbuilt market began to crash after the 1986 tax law removed 
some incentives for real estate 
real estate values actually have fallen faster than in texas 
stallings said 
the crash is the result of concern about the future of the 
insolvent thrifts and whether the government will end up dumping 
assets for now potential buyers are on the sidelines watching 
prices plummet 
everyone is pushing down trying to find the bottom you keep 
pushing and theres nothing there he said dallasfort worth 
was never as bad as values indicated they were and im seeing the 
same thing here 
western savings stallings thrift is much like some texas sampls 
one of arizonas oldest thrifts and today the states 
secondlargest western plunged into aggressive real estate lending 
much of which turned sour it needed big returns on investments to 
repay depositors it even ventured into the junk bonds and preferred 
stock of a muchtroubled dallas real estate investment firm 
southmark corp 
western lost a total 465 million investment in southmark is 
now worth less than 10 million 
like other arizona thrifts western has offered depositors some 
of the highest interest rates in the country just to keep money in 
the bank 
regulators forced the ouster of westerns top management and 
encouraged stallings hiring but it was too late in june 
regulators declared western insolvent and took control 
merabank had losses of 209 million last year and 292 million 
in the first quarter of this year analysts say that despite its 
more conservative management merabank teeters on the verge of 
insolvency 
with the way the arizona market has tanked even the bestrun 
thrifts have trouble surviving said snl securities analyst james 
marks 
longtime merabank chairman rice says hes been through five 
downturns in the sampl industry now each one worse than the previous 
in good times everyone thinks it will last forever in bad 
times everyone thinks it will never turn around and theyre both 
wrong rice said 
the thrift does have the advantage of an agreement between 
regulators and its parent company pinnacle west capital corp 
which also owns the states largest public utility the agreement is 
that pinnacle will maintain adequate levels of capital 
rivoir the banking commissioner has assembled an advisory 
committee and gone to washington to press for mercy stallings has 
proposed his own plan and met with business leaders he says are 
eager to help 
thrifts are hiring loan workout experts from texas and importing 
some of the techniques developed there to survive the thrift crisis 
according to phoenix banking consultant deborah bateman 
but investors and thrift executives can do little more than wait 
for washington to decide their fate ms bateman said she knows of 
investors who are ready to grab banks thrifts and their assets dirt 
cheap but regulators have put everything on hold until the bush 
plan is passed 
weve got conservators that are babysitters right now she 
said nothing is going on

the weather channel is just what its name implies 
weather reports nonstop 24 hours a day thats not 
entertainment but its attracting enough viewers and advertisers to 
keep things sunny at the 7yearold cable television station 
the concept of roundtheclock weather may sound unlikely to have 
viewers glued to their sets but the weather channel has grown to be 
the nations 14thlargest cable network in terms of subscribers 
the channel owned by virginiabased landmark communications 
inc is affiliated with 3650 cable systems across the nation and 
reaches 385 million households 
by comparison the nations top cable channel espn is available 
to 50 million subscribers according to the national cable 
television association an industry organization 
people laughed at landmark when we launched the weather channel 
no way said michael j eckert the president of the station 
industry observers really didnt give us more than a year and we 
proved them wrong 
but we always knew we were the ones who did the homework and 
the research he said we werent entertainment we werent 
flashy we werent glamorous you know its kind of everyday 
breadandbutter information 
eckert interviewed in his office below the channels suburban 
atlanta studios as a steady rain fell outside said he sees the 
attraction of fulltime weather in fairly simple terms like 
automated bank tellers fast food and speedy oil changes its a 
reflection of todays society in which quick information is at a 
premium he said 
america is becoming more and more an ondemand iwantitnow 
instantgratification society eckert said people are also in a 
position of requiring ondemand information 
frequent travelers outdoor workers farmers rescue agencies and 
those in the aviation industry are among the stations regular 
viewers eckert said families also want current weather information 
to help dress the kids for school or plan weekend outings 
eckert said the stations planners knew from the start viewers 
wouldnt watch weather programming like other tv fare 
we knew we couldnt expect people to watch us as they watch a 
halfhour tv program eckert said anybody that would watch us 
for a halfhour is probably one of those weather nuts who is really 
into weather as a dynamic 
they went out and filled a very valuable niche said john 
wolfe spokesman for the washingtonbased cable association if 
you live on the gulf coast in the hurricane season you develop a 
real appreciation for them 
there is much competition for reporting the weather eckert said 
but local radio and television reports provide weather information 
only a few minutes each day and newspaper weather pages are printed 
hours before the reader sees them he added 
while there is competition its not there all the time he 
said in some cases we supplement or complement whats there in 
others we replace it 
recently the station has incorporated a series of documentaries 
on such subjects as drought coastal erosion and earthquakes but 
the heart of the operation remains the continual weather reports and 
forecasts 
we live weather eckert said thats our business 
the channel employs 50 meteorologists and is now offering to 
cable systems a computer system called the weather star 4000 that 
taps into the nations more than 700 local weather zones to 
coordinate the local forecasts that are incorporated into the 
national programming about every five minutes eckert said 
because the typical weather channel viewer stays tuned in for 
only about 10 minutes at a time according to eckert the station 
sells its advertising space more like radio than the average tv 
station 
rather than selling for example one spot in a popular program 
the weather channel sells advertising spots to run many times a day 
to catch the viewers during their brief periods of watching the 
station eckert said instead of long breaks for clusters of 
commercials the weather station has frequent oneminute commercial 
breaks 
we generate audience like radio lots of turnover so 
advertisers buy us that way eckert said 
he said the channel currently has about 200 national advertisers 
though the main work of the station is to provide fast accurate 
weather information eckert said the channel is trying to make its 
presentation more visually attractive 
the reports are generally given from a set resembling a news 
program with maps the primary visual aid but the station is making 
increased use of graphics taped reports and live shots such as 
footage from the scene of severe weather during hurricane gilbert 
in 1988 the channel had two crews in jamaica to deliver live 
reports eckert said 
eckert said many of the weather channels viewers probably tuned 
in the first time during a period of severe weather he said he 
hopes that once someone sees what that channel has to offer they 
will come back for more 
we spend millions of dollars a year on viewer research 
eckert said we are in a continual state of evolution were very 
consumerdriven

in another sign of an economic slowdown the 
nations purchasing managers reported monday that the us 
manufacturing economy declined in june for the second straight month 
analysts said the monthly report by the national association of 
purchasing management provided more evidence of an acrosstheboard 
economic slackening but not a recession 
its telling us what weve already been sensing that the 
economy has been growing less rapidly said robert chandross 
chief economist with lloyds bank plc in new york but i dont 
think it is an indication that would signal were in a recession 
the purchasing managers index slumped to 488 percent from 497 
percent in may the decline put the index at its lowest level since 
july 1986 when it was 48 percent the may decline was the first in 
33 months 
a reading above 50 indicates the economy is generally expanding 
below 50 that the economy is generally declining the difference 
from 50 indicates the intensity of the change 
production by the nations factories was the only indicator to 
increase while new orders declined for the first time since may 
1986 and inventories also fell vendor deliveries were faster for 
the second month a sign of declining demand after 31 months in 
which they were reported slower 
the total economy continued down the path toward slower growth 
as it ended the second quarter said robert j bretz chairman of 
the tempe arizbased trade group 
the best news is that inflation appears to be slowing at a 
faster pace than the overall economy said bretz director of 
materials management at pitney bowes inc 
the purchasing managers price index fell for the second 
consecutive month to 485 percent down sharply from 576 percent 
in may and the lowest since it was 428 percent in april 1986 
it was the first time in 34 months that more purchasers reported 
price decreases than increases indicating that inflation may be 
ebbing 
while the purchasing report surveys only the manufacturing sector 
and gives equal weight to small and large firms it is the first 
economic gauge released each month and generally receives wide 
attention as an early signal 
the groups figures are compiled through a monthly survey of 
purchasing executives at more than 250 industrial companies the 
report was released monday morning for immediate use in a policy 
change from previous months when it was released on friday and 
ordered held for publication until monday 
the report follows economic news last month indicating further 
softness 
orders to factories for manufactured goods slumped 27 percent in 
may the key index of leading economic indicators dropped 12 
percent its steepest decline since the october 1987 stock market 
crash durable goods orders plunged at the steepest rate in 10 
months and consumer spending also declined sharply 
many analysts believe the declines are consistent with the 
federal reserves attempt to engineer a socalled soft landing with 
slower growth and less inflation that wont drive the economy into a 
recession 
we do expect to see a very slow economy in the next three 
quarters but we do not expect to see a recession said david wyss 
chief financial economist for drimcgrawhill inc in lexington 
mass 
the purchasing management group said its overall index has 
averaged 514 percent for the first half of 1989 but 505 percent 
for the second quarter it said the secondquarter figure indicates 
annual growth of about 2 percent in the gross national product the 
value of all goods and services produced 
the group said the index would have to fall below 44 percent 
before signaling a decline in the inflationadjusted gnp 
new orders declined in june after 48 months of expansion falling 
to 472 percent from 534 percent in may it was the indicators 
lowest level since 472 percent in september 1984 
production though expanded in june for the 35th straight month 
rising to 524 percent from 511 percent in may inventories were 
497 percent the nearest level to growth since last decembers 508 
percent the groups inventories index was 419 percent in may 
the group said 65 percent of members that use steel plan to 
increase inventories to guard against possible production slowdowns

weeks losses to close significantly higher monday on the london 
stock exchange

government bonds gave a mixed performance during 
an abbreviated session monday with longterm issues falling while 
other maturities made modest gains 
the volume of business in the credit markets was light and 
trading ended earlier than normal ahead of the independence day 
holiday when us financial markets will be closed 
the 30year treasury bond the markets benchmark issue fell 
1332 point or just over 325 for every 1000 in face value its 
yield which moves in the opposite direction to price finished 
trading at 806 percent up from 803 percent late friday 
marilyn cohen president of the beverly hills calif brokerage 
capital insight said that after a brief flurry of government bond 
trading early on the market settled down with most issues merely 
marking time 
i think most of the people who ended up staying home did the 
right thing said cohen its been a nonevent 
a monthly report from the national association of purchasing 
management had limited impact on bond prices or interest rates 
because it didnt reveal anything unexpected 
the purchasing managers index sagged to 488 percent in june 
from 497 percent in may the decline put the index at its lowest 
level since july 1986 when it was 48 percent the may decline was 
the first in 33 months 
economists interpreted the decline in the widelywatched 
indicator as the latest in a series of statistics pointing to 
weakening business activity 
but bond traders have already been operating under that 
assumption so there was little incentive to buy or sell monday based 
on the news 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds rose 132 point the average yield to 
maturity declined to 720 percent from 729 percent late friday the 
size of the decline was due in part to the replacement of some 
highcoupon bonds in the index that were sparsely traded by newer 
issues with lower coupon rates the bond buyer said 
in corporate trading industrials were up moodys investment 
grade corporate bond index which measures total return on a 
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer rose 008 to 32752 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues rose 116 point to 532 point 
intermediate maturities rose by 132 point to 332 point and 
longterm issues fell 1132 point to 1332 point according to 
telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer edged down by 023 to 118564 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 821 percent as the 
discount slid 3 basis points to 795 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills held at 807 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 
767 percent yields on 1year bills declined to 802 percent as the 
discount slipped 6 basis points to 747 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at the end of trading at 9 716 percent up from 
9 percent late friday

cheap badly labeled and inferior tuna and 
other canned sea foods mostly from thailand and peru are flooding 
the market providing disloyal competition for mexicos 
fishermen and canners a spokesman for the industry said monday 
andres armenta gonzalez president of the chamber of fishing 
industries also complained in an interview with the excelsior news 
agency that new seafood farming in several nations and and cheap 
fish meal from peru are giving mexican fisheries a rough time 
gonzalez said this years sea catches are very good with about 
65000 tons harvested up to now and an estimated 150000 projected 
for the entire year 
but he complained that canned tuna from thailand and peru comes 
in to mexico without proper labeling and in some cases is 
unhygienically packed 
gonzalez also said products from seafood farms in china and 
ecuador produced at lower costs are tending to edge mexican 
seaharvested items out of traditional markets 
in addition to that fish meal from peru is entering this 
country without any kind of quality control he added fish meal 
is used principally as feed for the poultry industry 
mexican industrialists have been complaining about foreign 
competition ever since mexico joined the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade in 198687 and opened its doors to foreign imports

the supreme court on monday rejected three 
appeals raising the issue of whether skyrocketing punitivedamage 
awards in personal injury lawsuits violate dueprocess rights 
the decisions came one week after the court suggested it would be 
willing to decide such cases 
without comment the justices turned away the case of a 178 
million award won by ventriloquist paul winchell over the 
destruction of all videotapes of his popular childrens television 
show of the 1960s 
the court refused to hear arguments by metromedia inc that the 
bulk of the california jury award 14 million in punitive damages 
is unconstitutional 
the court also refused to hear an appeal by goodyear tire amp 
rubber co which was ordered to pay 4 million in punitive damages 
to a minnesota service station attendant injured by an exploding 
tire 
and the justices refused to study the issue in an appeal by a 
salt mining company ordered to pay 10 million in punitive damages 
to kansas farmers whose crops were ruined 
in other businessrelated decisions the high court 
allowed the government to enforce regulations barring sales at 
below market value in a way foreign companies and us importers 
claim improperly impedes international trade 
the court rejected a canadian steel producers appeal that was 
supported by a us exportimport association and an international 
consumers group 
agreed to reexamine how far states may go to prohibit 
advertising by lawyers in an appeal by an illinois lawyer censured 
for saying on his professional letterhead he is a civil trial 
specialist certified by a private organization 
ordered reargument of related cases from arkansas and florida on 
whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax as an 
undue burden on interstate commerce is entitled to be refunded money 
it paid before the tax was invalidated 
told a federal appeals court to restudy a lawsuit accusing 
billionaire hotel owner harry helmsley and his business partners of 
fraud in connection with a new york city condominium conversion 
on punitive damages the high court june 26 ruled that the 
awards no matter how large do not violate the constitutions ban 
on excessive fines the court said 72 that the ban does not apply 
to civil lawsuits between private citizens or corporations 
but it left open the possibility that dueprocess guarantees 
the constitutions assurance of fair play may limit juries 
discretion to award enormous sums in civil suits 
the court was being urged in the three cases to impose a broad 
standard for judges and juries particularly in states that have not 
imposed ceilings on damage awards not to rule on the 
constitutionality of such limits 
business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumer 
groups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a range 
of lawsuits 
opponents say the bigmoney awards are catastrophic for us 
competitiveness and discourage development of potentially risky 
products particularly new forms of medical treatment they also say 
juries penalize the wealthy in order to benefit victims 
consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a 
powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public 
safety they say large corporations may view smaller compensatory 
awards as an acceptable cost of doing business 
the winchell case stemmed from a 1965 contract calling for him to 
produce and host the winchellmahoney time television show 
which featured winchells dummy jerry mahoney 
a dispute between winchell and metromedia arose in 1969 over 
future broadcast rights of tapes of 288 shows metromedia erased all 
288 tapes in 1972 when winchell learned in 1976 that the tapes had 
been destroyed he sued metromedia for breach of contract 
in the case of the exploding tire goodyear was ordered to pay 
337 million in compensatory damages and 4 million in punitive 
damages to dale hodder 
hodder who worked at a service station in remer minn was 17 
at the time of the accident on dec 19 1981 the metal rim of a 
truck tire manufactured in 1955 exploded while he was mounting the 
tire on a customers logging truck goodyear has since discontinued 
making that type of tire called a krim 
in the kansas case general host corp and its subsidiary cudahy 
co were ordered to pay rice county farmers 306 million for actual 
damages from 1975 through 1983 plus the 10 million punitive award 
salt mining operations run by the companies were found to have 
polluted an underground stream making the water unusable for 
irrigation

coffee futures prices collapsed to an 8year low monday as the 
international coffee organization suspended export quotas and 
traders positioned themselves for an expected surge in available 
supplies 
i think its a bonanza for the american consumer said bert 
ruiz a vice president with the new york brokerage firm balfour 
maclaine corp who predicted that wholesale prices of canned 
roasted coffee would drop by 20 cents a pound 
on other markets pork futures plunged their permitted daily 
limits corn and soybean futures rallied strongly and precious 
metals advanced 
oil futures were not traded monday because the new york 
mercantile exchange was closed for the independence day holiday all 
of the nations commodity exchanges were scheduled to be closed on 
tuesday 
green unroasted coffee settled 6 cents to 1607 cents lower on 
new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for 
delivery in july at 9763 cents a pound and the most active 
contract for september delivery at 9384 cents a pound it was the 
lowest close since mid1981 when coffee futures sank as low as 
8050 cents a pound 
the collapse was triggered by the international coffee 
organizations decision to suspend quotas on exports of coffee from 
its producer members to its consumer members the decision came 
after representatives of the 74 nations that comprise the 
organization meeting in london failed to muster majority support 
for either of two proposals for a new agreement to succeed the 
6year pact that expires sept 30 
both failed proposals would have retained a quota system for 
stabilizing coffee prices instead the group approved a 2year 
extension of the current agreement minus the quotas which will 
keep the organization alive as a recordkeeping body 
the largest coffeeconsuming nations including the united 
states had opposed any new agreement that did not increase the 
availability of highquality arabica coffees consumer nations also 
wanted tighter restrictions on sales of coffee at cutrate prices to 
countries that are not members of the organization 
quotas have been suspended twice before for a total of 8 years 
since the ico was established in 1963 the most recent suspension 
which ended in october 1987 lasted about 1 years 
ruiz said the suspension of quotas will increase the availability 
of highquality coffees at lower prices citing indications that 
some of the major south american and central american coffee 
producers are sitting on large stockpiles 
but other analysts said the world coffee surplus could be much 
smaller than some believe and that there was no reason to assume the 
coffee market will soon be flooded 
the market had a very hysterical reaction and it was mostly 
speculative said an analyst for a large trade house who asked not 
to be named i dont think it necessarily means anything 
pork futures tumbled their permitted daily limits on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in reaction to fridays quarterly agriculture 
department hogsandpigs report which showed more animals than the 
market had expected 
live cattle were 22 cent to 55 cent lower with august at 6982 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 35 cent to 65 cent lower with 
august at 8035 cents a pound live hogs were 150 cents lower 
across the board with july at 4717 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with july at 3385 cents 
a pound 
corn and soybean futures surged on the chicago board of trade 
amid forecasts for an extended spell of hot dry weather in the 
midwest 
some forecasters dont see any rain at all for the next week or 
so said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago 
wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents lower with july at 394 a 
bushel corn was 4 cents to 8 cents higher with july at 272 a 
bushel oats were 7 cents to 8 cents higher with july at 157 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 19 cents higher with july at 
740 a bushel 
gold and silver futures posted strong gains on new yorks 
commodity exchange largely in reaction to the weaker dollar 
gold settled 370 to 380 higher with august at 38110 a troy 
ounce silver was 71 cents to 75 cents higher with july at 523 a 
troy ounce

the supreme court on monday refused to let 
officials in burlington vt regulate the rates a cable television 
company charges customers in that city 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that federal law 
barred the local officials from setting cable tv rates 
burlington officials in june 1985 signed a contract with mountain 
cable co to provide cable service to city residents 
mountain cable took over the city cable franchise after acquiring 
the company that had provided the service burlington has had cable 
tv service since the 1950s 
city officials said the agreement between the city and mountain 
cable barred the company from raising customer rates until dec 29 
1987 
the company raised its monthly rate from 1050 to 1250 on jan 
1 1987 
the vermont supreme court ruled last year that a federal law that 
took effect oct 30 1984 barred the city from regulating cable tv 
rates 
burlington officials said the federal law limiting local rate 
regulation was aimed only at franchising authorities 
the city officials argued that a vermont state agency the public 
service board had the power to award franchises therefore they 
said the city should be free to control rates charged by mountain 
cable 
the state court said while the city may be correct in arguing 
that the public service board is a franchising authority here the

canola may become an economic lifesaver 
for farmers in the south and midwest as the lowfat cooking oil 
squeezed from the plants seeds becomes more popular with 
healthconscious consumers 
canola oil is lower in saturated fat than other popular cooking 
oils including coconut oil soybean oil and corn oil experts say 
saturated fat has been linked to cholesterol a substance that 
can contribute to clogged arteries and heart disease 
we think it will be a viable crop for the midsouth and at 
yields that will be successful for economic returns said john f 
bradley superintendent of the university of tennessee agriculture 
experiment station at milan it will give our farmers in this area 
an alternative crop 
we are not saying its going to be the salvation of the farmer 
but it is real promising he said 
canola is a variety of rapeseed from which the oil is squeezed 
canada and europe are the largest producers of canola before 
1985 the us food and drug administration listed the seeds oil as 
toxic to humans and banned its growth but genetic engineering 
produced an edible variety and the fda removed the restrictions 
this released us from having to import from canada and 
europe bradley said we have found that it can be grown in the 
midsouth and the midwest 
nevertheless only about 70000 acres are now grown in the united 
states us department of agriculture statistics show 440 million 
pounds of canola oil were imported this year 
researchers say canolas seed production is high and that on a 
profit basis it outperforms soybeans 
kentucky and illinois are the chief producers of canola in the 
united states kentucky growers planted about 2000 acres of canola 
in 1987 then 8000 acres as it caught on in 1988 according to a 
study by the university of kentucky 
farmers in indiana tennessee ohio and michigan so far have only 
dabbled in the crop but bradley believes over the next five years 
canola will become commonplace throughout the midsouth 
canola has become more popular with consumers recently as health 
concerns have arisen over the use of tropical oils found to be high 
in saturated fats 
i think we will see probably more people going over to canola 
oil as their cooking oil said wayne flinchum professor of plant 
and soil science at the university of tennessee agriculture 
extension service in jackson tenn 
i dont think we will see a shift by the billions but youll 
see more and more people over time shift to canola oil as their 
deepfat frying oil food companies have begun switching to canola 
and other lowerfat oils in response to concerns over health risks 
associated with highly saturated tropical oils procter amp gambles 
puritan brand cooking oil is 100 percent canola oil and a company 
spokesman said demand is good and is expected to grow 
the taste of canola oil differs slightly from soybean oil and 
will develop a fishy taste if used for more than one frying said 
sharon melton a professor of food technology and science at the 
university of tennessee at knoxville 
before canola which grows best from october through june wheat 
was the only crop that could be grown in the winter 
canola yields about the same amount or slightly less per acre 
than wheat and uses the same equipment and supplies such as 
herbicides 
the growing season is also attractive because domestic canola is 
harvested in summer just after canadian farmers have planted their 
crop 
it also brings more per bushel at current market prices than 
winter wheat about 7 per bushel of canola versus 4 per bushel of 
wheat bradley said 
perhaps the only problem is making farmers aware of canola 
farmers are real traditional and it takes them awhile to try 
something new bradley said
