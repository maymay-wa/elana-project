ramon salcido said in a statement 
played for jurors thursday that anger and drugs sparked the rage 
that led him to kill seven people 
i dont feel like i wanted to kill nobody i wanna have 
some beers you know and forget everything else but wifes made 
me feel that way when she start when she left me at home with my 
kids and take off ramon salcido said in the twohour tape that 
jurors followed with the help of a transcript 
salcido 29 is being tried in san mateo superior court for the 
murder of his wife angela two of his daughters his motherinlaw 
and her two daughters and a coworker at the grand cru winery 
he also faces three counts of attempted murder for attacks on a 
third daughter another coworker and the coworkers wife 
salcido was arrested in his native mexico four days after the 
april 14 1989 slayings in sonoma county the trial was moved here 
because of extensive pretrial publicity 
in the taped statement salcido made while being returned to 
california he said he was angry with his wife because she had 
married him while pregnant with another mans child he said he was 
angry at his motherinlaw for not telling him about the childs 
parentage and angry at his supervisor because he thought the man 
tried to have him fired 
defense attorney marteen miller concedes his client committed 
the crimes but claims salcido was not capable of planning the 
murders and therefore should not be convicted of firstdegree 
murder or face the death penalty 
salcido had been an alcoholic since age 18 and had consumed 
three grams of cocaine and three bottles of champagne in the hours 
before the slayings miller claims 
prosecutor peter bumerts said the tape supports his contention 
the slayings were premeditated 
anybody that says i decided to go kill my children because i 
was mad at my wife and then goes to a place where he will not be 
seen is not mentally impaired bumerts said 
near the end of the statement when asked if he wants to add 
anything more salcido said the drug dealers who supplied him are 
partly responsible claiming he would not have committed the 
attacks sober 
several times salcido expressed remorse said he was scared and 
that he felt as though he were someone else 
im ready to receive anything and everything you guys to do 
he said i dont feel like i wanted to try not being guilty when 
i know i know that im guilty

president alberto fujimori whose country is 
starved for foreign capital says he will ease restrictions on 
foreign investment in perus petroleum fishing mining and tourism 
industries 
fujimori said wednesday that he would promote legislation to 
speed up negotiations with foreign investors and eliminate laws 
that limit the potential profitability of these investments 
foreign corporations will soon be able to repatriate profits 
from their peruvian operations fujimori told a luncheon given by 
the american chamber of commerce in lima 
upon taking office on july 28 fujimori began a series of 
measures to curb hyperinflation and open perus economy to world 
markets 
the measures have included drastic rises in the costs of 
government services and the end of most price controls and 
subsidies 
fujimori also slashed import tariffs forcing perus 
traditionally highly protected industries to compete with foreign 
products 
the measures sent prices soaring 397 percent in august but 
prices in september are expected to rise less than 5 percent 
the austerity plan has left perus economy virtually paralyzed 
many factories are closed and thousands of small businesses are 
expected to go bankrupt 
at wednesdays lunch fujimori assured businessmen they were 
safe from the risk of of expropriation illegal change of 
ownership or conversion into national currency of foreign profits 
in peru 
fujimoris predecessor alan garcia threatened to nationalize 
various foreign concerns in peru these included the mines of 
southern peru copper corporation the largest us company 
operating in peru 
fujimori said the results of his austerity measures were 
encouraging 
he said peru needed fiscal and monetary discipline to create a 
climate of confidence for foreign investment 
president george bush has said prosperity in latin america 
depends on trade not aid fujimori said we agree on that 
one 
fujimoris prime minister juan hurtado miller is in washington 
this week for talks with the international monetary fund 
peru cut relations with the imf in 1987 after unilaterally 
limiting payments on its 20 billion foreign debt the year before 
hurtado hopes to come home with fresh loans if the imf approves

production has been stalled by his insistence on a black director 
the playwright said he is seeking a director who would 
approach my work with the same amount of passion and measure of 
respect with which i approach it and who shares the same cultural

israeli peace activists have renewed dialogue 
with palestinian leaders following disagreements over the plos 
position in the persian gulf crisis 
after a twohour meeting the leftist peace now movement and 
palestinians headed by activist faisal husseini agreed late 
wednesday to resume talks on the occupied territories and other 
issues 
we want to keep up our meetings even if is against the emotion 
in the street right now husseini told an assembly of 100 
israelis 
the going will be tough yitzhak galnoor a peace now 
activist but once all the dust settles we see that three years 
of an uprising cannot be ignored we still have the same problem to 
solve 
during the 34monthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip at least 996 
palestinians have been killed and 52 israelis and foreigners have 
died 
quarrels among the peace groups began when the palestine 
liberation organization sided with iraqi leader saddam hussein 
following the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
husseini said the plo objects to war and to iraqs occupation of 
kuwait but he also said palestinians were angrier with the united 
states than they were supportive of iraq 
american forces are there for their own interests the price 
of oil but they are completely neglecting our case he said 
husseini was unable to persuade israelis at the meeting to issue 
a joint statement urging the united states to resolve the persian 
gulf crisis peacefully and then turn to the palestinian issue 
another palestinian activist ghassan khatib asserted there 
were some mistakes made by palestinians and the plo about the gulf 
crisis and we should acknowledge that 
we feared from the start we were going to be losers khatib 
added noting the gulf problems have overshadowed the palestinian 
issues 
both sides agreed to continue their meetings leaders of peace 
now resolved to press on trying to persuade israelis that the 
government should end its diplomatic boycott of the plo 
were going to have to get back to this issue there is no 
other solution but to talk to the palestinians the plo said 
galia golan a professor of political science at jerusalems hebrew 
university

there will be fewer maps for troops in the 
middle east a million children wont be vaccinated against polio 
measles and diphtheria there may not be enough government lawyers 
to argue before the supreme court airline flights will be reduced 
and most space shuttles wont fly at all 
all this and more is predicted if there is no budget agreement 
and the president orders automatic spending cuts monday the first 
day of the governments 1991 fiscal year 
for 24 million federal employees with mortgage payments and 
mouths to feed the impact could range from a few days off without 
pay to the devastation that faces jeannette gordon she could be 
laid off 255 days out of a work year of 260 
most agencies of the government expect to be forced to trim 
expenses by 324 percent theyll do it by cutting services to the 
taxpayer suspending programs furloughing employees putting off 
that needed paint job or turning out the lights at night 
the grammrudman law doesnt much care it requires whatever it 
takes to slim down federal spending by 100 billion or so in fiscal 
1991 most federal employees can be laid off for 22 days with a 
simple notice after that the rules get more complicated 
the prospect facing mrs gordon who works for perhaps the 
smallest agency in government is unique 
we dont have contracts we can cut and we dont have employees 
to lay off says mrs gordon one of two people who run the 
susquehanna river basin commission my budget for 1991 is 
211000 our 324 percent is 68364 she says what remains 
goes into office expenses and the salary of commissioner warner 
depuy who wont be furloughed because he is a presidential 
appointee 
that she says with a sigh doesnt leave anything to hire 
me 
ironically mrs gordon used to work at the office of management 
and budget which tells the president what kind of a cut to order 
i worked at omb for 17 years she says i was always on the 
other end of pennsylvania avenue i never knewit worked like 
that 
the way it works is this to save money 
there would be fewer maps produced by the defense mapping 
agency which has worked overtime to make 20 million maps for 
operation desert shield since the middle east crisis began the 
agencys 8000 employees are on notice they might be furloughed 
meat counters would be emptier as 7344 federal meat and 
poultry inspectors shave weeks off their annual duties a 
sequester which is what the cutback in funds is called would 
result in the absence of inspection services and the shutting down 
of meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants for about 140 
days the house appropriations committee predicts 
nasa would have to cancel the space station and drop or 
postpone all 21 shuttle flights scheduled in 1991 and 1992 
according to the committee but the agency says it has enough money 
left over to launch the first shuttle in the new fiscal year on 
oct 6 
commercial airplanes would not be able to fly at night because 
the national weather service will close 250 stations from 6 pm to 
6 am pilots need uptodate weather information the federal 
aviation administration would start cutbacks with 20 percent fewer 
flights the first three days because controllers will be furloughed 
two days each in every twoweek pay period 
many important government activities are immune to cutbacks the 
postal service which gets its money from the business it conducts 
is not affected social security benefits federal retirement and 
disability payments veterans compensation and pensions state 
unemployment and many lowincome entitlement programs are 
untouched 
the affairs of state wont suffer the state department plans to 
exempt people whose jobs deal with crisis spots but cut back on 
travel and overtime the white house will furlough people one day a 
week on different days a joke making the rounds is that 
presidential dog millie will have to give back one of her pups 
the justice department said furloughs during the first two weeks 
of the new fiscal year would range from one day per drug 
enforcement administration employee to nine days at the foreign 
claims settlement commission layoffs will hobble prosecutions of 
savings and loan fraud and make it difficult to operate the 
nations overcrowded federal prisons officials say 
the furloughs hit us at the worst possible time said deputy 
solicitor general john roberts whose lawyers are scheduled to 
argue 10 of the 20 cases scheduled to be heard before the supreme 
court in the first two weeks of october 
the arguments will be 20 percent shorter roberts quipped 
checks written to farmers under various commodity programs 
including price support loans and direct payments will be reduced 
by the percentage of the sequester 
about 84 million in federal grants to states for foster care 
adoption and child protective services would be eliminated 
straining state child welfare systems biomedical research would be 
cut by 35 billion and 30000 drug abusers would not get 
treatment 
the government has pulled its perils of pauline act nearly every 
year in recent times threatening to run out of money but congress 
always comes to the rescue sequestration has been required only 
twice before in the current fiscal year which ends sunday and in 
1986 
the general accounting office checked five departments to see 
how they were affected by the 1990 cutback and found few dire 
effects 
although many agencies will hold staff meetings on friday to 
finalize their plans the likelihood is that no one will know the 
extent of the required cuts if any until sunday 
if there is no action before friday said laura kopelson of 
gao our instructions are to be watching the news on monday 
morning

as the change of season cools the 
sunscorched saudi desert and fills the sky with clouds us 
military planners have a new weather worry sandstorms 
a sarrayat arabic for the night comer could occur at 
critical moments for ground forces whose tactics are heavily 
geared toward fighting under cover of darkness 
the night sandstorms are brief but violent and are sometimes 
accompanied by lightning and thunder 
even in daylight strategists must reckon with seasonal storms 
called shamal the arabic word for north which pick up sand 
and turn the sky yellow for hours or an entire day 
a us navy captain said recently that his ship had turned from 
the official gray to a subtle shade of brown after a few weeks in 
the persian gulf 
american troops have learned to protect their vehicles and 
aircraft from the incessant dust and sand using such 
modifications as pantyhose for filters but they have not yet 
experienced the fury of the sustained desert winds that sometimes 
reduce visibility to near zero and cause even the hardiest bedouins 
and their camels to hunker down 
were not overly concerned just aware that theres a 
possibility of dust storms said 1st lt todd fasking an air 
force meteorologist 
the percent of time that they occur is really very small but 
if a storm comes at absolutely the worst time the percentage 
doesnt matter 
saudi experts say the desert storms this time of year are less 
severe than those of the khamseen or 50 days from late may 
through early july when the indian ocean monsoons generate a 
lowpressure system over the desert 
american strategists have not forgotten the 1980 iranian hostage 
rescue attempt that ended in disaster when the helicopters suddenly 
became caught in a sandstorm that one pilot later described as 
like flying in a bowl of milk 
and history suggests that the northern saudi region where more 
than 150000 us troops are deployed may be overdue for bad 
weather 
jaber jum ah a consultant on desert weather for aramco the 
saudiowned oil company said severe storm seasons come every six 
or seven years he last one was in 1983 he said 
they usually occur between oct 10 and nov 10 he said 
the worst season in modern times was 1925 the year of the 
sinkings socalled because hundreds of small craft were 
swamped and lost in a gulf storm that lasted about half an hour 
the gulf is not so deep and the seas can run as much as 15 
feet not serious for big ships but very dangerous for small 
ones jum ah said 
while the storms may arise suddenly meteorologists say 
threatening weather patterns can be predicted and monitored 
fasking said winter frontal systems develop in saudi arabia much 
as they do in united states generally moving from west to east 
and can be observed by satellite 
we can see a front coming and track it fasking said with 
the satellite we can see suspended sand as it kicks up out of 
northern saudi arabia into central saudi 
he said advisories are issued when winds reach velocities that 
could jeopardize visibility for air operations

thousands of filipinos are fleeing 
the persian gulf area but thousands more are still flocking to the 
middle east searching for jobs to escape poverty and hopelessness 
in this troubled island nation 
over the last year an average of 15000 filipinos a month left 
for jobs in the gulf and that figure still holds true despite the 
crisis precipitated by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait according 
to the staterun philippine overseas employment agency 
chartered jets which recently flew hundreds of exhausted and 
penniless refugees home from camps in jordan have been returning to 
the middle east packed with new jobseekers 
if you remain in our country you will never prosper said 
letty solis whose mechanic husband leopoldo is still looking for 
work after returning from kuwait last month 
statistics show why filipinos leave families behind to work in 
the gulf 
the unemployment rate here stands at more than 8 percent and is 
expected to increase as thousands of workers return from kuwait and 
iraq 
before the crisis an estimated 90000 filipinos were working in 
kuwait and iraq about 16500 have returned to the philippines 
the mimimum pay you get here is not enough to buy the basics 
for yourself much less your family said miguel ramos 35 an 
unemployed electrician who has just been hired by a firm in saudi 
arabia 
a job here for ramos would pay about 88 a month he expects to 
make more than four times that in the gulf 
ramos acknowledged its a gamble i know its risky but id 
rather take it besides things are so unstable in our country 
anyway that it doesnt make any difference where you are if you 
are used to hardships then it doesnt matter if theres war 
president corazon aquinos government has promised to help 
workers who fled kuwait and iraq find other jobs abroad but of the 
16500 workers who have come home since the invasion fewer than 
100 have found new jobs overseas through government efforts 
for most conditions are desperate many of those who left 
kuwait lost most of their savings when banks wre closed and the 
kuwaiti dinar declared invalid 
gulf labor laws make it nearly impossible for refugees from 
kuwait to land jobs in saudi arabia the united arab emirates or 
other gulf countries without first returning to the philippines 
every day the semiprivate overseas workers welfare 
adminstration headquarters teems with returnees inquiring about 
jobs abroad and applying for 120 in emergency displacement loans 
which returning workers are authorized to obtain 
that would feed an averagesized filipino family of five for two 
weeks many must borrow money or move in with friends and relatives 
after years of relative comfort and prosperity abroad 
i will still go back there if things normalize said mars 
ariola who worked in kuwait as a truck driver for five years if 
i cannot get into the middle east then i will try europe or any 
other country 
except for banning travel to kuwait iraq and parts of saudi 
arabia the government has done nothing to prevent thousands of its 
citizens from working in the persian gulf despite fears that the 
region may explode into fullscale war 
filipinos working in the middle east send home about 13 
billion a year a major source of foreign exchange remittances 
from kuwait and iraq accounted for about 5 percent of the foreign 
exchange official figures show 
we have to consider the need for them to earn and also for the 
country to get revenues from the foreign exchange earnings of our 
workers presidential spokesman adolf azcuna said we just hope 
that the workers will be deployed to areas far from trouble

the persian gulf crisis is forcing 
saudi arabia which traditionally has relied on quiet diplomacy to 
take aggressive steps even against arab states once considered 
allies 
jordan and yemen have already experienced the newfound saudi 
punitive power indications are that the palestine liberation 
organization or at least its leader yasser arafat will be next 
sudan another recipient of saudi financial aid that has not 
broken with iraq over its aug 2 invasion of kuwait could soon see 
its relations with riyadh sour 
there will be a settlement of accounts when this is over a 
saudi diplomatic official said wednesday we have to stand up for 
principle it is no more mr nice guy there is no longer the 
fear of offending arabs 
as saudi arabia deliberately strains relations with some 
traditional arab allies it is moving quickly to improve its 
position on the world stage reestablishing ties with moscow and 
beijing 
senior saudi officials believe the crisis has dashed any hopes 
for arab unity and created an atmosphere in which arab states will 
seek to bolster their standing outside the region 
the bubble of panarabism is burst said the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity now maybe all of us can be 
more honest 
the international rush to help defend saudi arabia from iraq has 
persuaded saudi officials they can take on fellow arab states over 
disputes they might have glossed over in the past 
the whole world has underwritten the security of the gulf 
region a saudi prince said monday 
in the past saudi arabia shied away from a forceful public role 
in arab policy debates choosing quiet diplomacy and use of its 
huge foreign aid budget to sway friends 
now angered by king husseins refusal to break with baghdad and 
by the jordanian monarchs criticism of the saudis for opening 
their country to foreign troops the saudi government has come out 
swinging 
prince bandar bin sultan the saudi ambassador to the united 
states wrote an open letter to hussein attacking the king he 
ended i no longer can feel that you are the same man i knew 
choosing bandar to deliver the message was a sign of the saudis 
new interest in aggressive diplomacy 
the playing field was american public opinion the saudi 
official said king hussein was trying to go over our head and 
over the head of george bush so we chose our spokesman who was 
most eloquent in dealing with american matters 
bandars public denouncement came after a series of jolts in 
saudijordanian relations 
saudi arabia first cut off jordans oil supplies saying ammans 
bills were overdue then expelled most jordanian diplomats for 
alleged espionage 
none of this convinced hussein to change course and we 
lost patience another saudi official said he said jordan has 
received little if any saudi aid since the invasion right now 
our line is the check is in the mail soon hell find out we 
forgot to put a stamp on it 
with yemen which initially opposed slapping santions on iraq 
saudi arabia ended its open border policy and then expelled most 
yemeni diplomats for alleged espionage 
yemen sided with the saudis when the un security council voted 
tuesday to impose an air embargo against iraq the saudi diplomatic 
official said riyadh viewed those votes as encouraging but was not 
yet ready to forgive yemen 
our actions might have had something to do with the vote but 
there was a lot of american pressure too one of the officials 
said 
the saudis are far more reluctant to criticize arafat but say 
privately that he is unwelcome in their country and could face 
sharp cutbacks in aid 
one idea under consideration is to give direct aid to 
palestinian housing and other social services projects but little 
or nothing to the plo chief directly 
the saudi officials said they have been satisfied with their 
handling of the gulf crisis to date but it was too soon to grade 
diplomatic efforts 
we have to be aggressive now it is a matter of life and 
death the diplomatic official said but we cant say what will 
happen in the future we are all learning a lesson right now

new census bureau figures show that the gap 
between the rich and the poor is widening says the chairman of the 
congressional joint economic committee 
those at the top of the scale are receiving an everlarger 
share of the pie rep lee hamilton dind said wednesday after 
the bureau released its annual report on income and poverty 
meanwhile families in the middle and at the bottom are barely 
keeping ahead of inflation hamilton said the gap between the 
rich and the poor is widening when it should be shrinking 
robert greenstein executive director of a liberal research 
group the center on budget and policy priorities said the 128 
percent poverty rate reported by the bureau is a bad sign 
with the economy running out of steam and a new recession 
threatening the poverty rate is likely to start rising again 
greenstein said that means an already high poverty rate is 
likely to climb higher and if the recession is a deep one it could 
reach poverty levels not seen for a quarter of a century 
both liberals and conservatives continued to clamor for a change 
in the way the census bureau figures out who is poor 
for the third year in a row the bureau said the decline in the 
poverty rate between 1988 and 1989 was so small that it was not 
statistically significant the 1988 rate was 13 percent 
the bureau said 315 million americans were below the poverty 
level last year for a family of four that level is an annual 
income of 12675 in 1988 317 million were below it 
it is time to update our official poverty measure to provide a 
more accurate reflection of todays economic needs hamilton 
said 
a joint economic committee study last year suggested that the 
poverty thresholds might increase as much as 50 percent if they 
took into account such things as the increasing share of income 
that is now paid for housing 
on the other hand kate obeirne deputy director for domestic 
policy studies at the conservative heritage foundation said 
owing to the method they use the census bureau dramatically 
overstates the number of people in poverty 
the problem she said is that the bureau counts only money as 
income and does not include such things as food stamps and medicaid 
and medicare benefits 
in an appendix to its report the census bureau said that with 
the addition of these and other noncash items the poverty rate 
would be as low as 104 percent 
both daniel weinberg chief of the housing and household 
economic statistics division of the bureau and greenstein said 
that adopting such an alternative method would not affect the trend 
of poverty rates 
the bureau reported that median household income in 1989 was 
28910 up 13 percent from 1988 after adjusting for rising living 
costs household income had been unchanged in the previous two 
years 
the bureau said the wealthiest onefifth of households received 
468 percent of the income while this was no higher than in 1988 
it was significantly higher than the percentages of 442 percent in 
1979 and 43 percent in 1969 
those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder received 
somewhat lower shares of the aggregate income 
there seems little doubt that the income distribution has 
become somewhat less equal over the past 20 years the bureau 
said it said the reasons for this are not clear

the air force is estimating that the cost of 
its c17 transport has risen to 400 million per plane and fears 
the aircrafts manufacturer mcdonnell douglas may go bankrupt by 
years end a house committee chairman says 
in a letter released wednesday rep john dingell dmich 
cited the companys cost overruns and excessive work hours as 
evidence of a management collapse in the program to build 120 
of the widebody planes 
dingell based his assessment on internal pentagon documents 
reports from mcdonnell douglas and an inquiry conducted by the 
staff of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight 
and investigations dingell is chairman of both the full committee 
and the subcommittee 
an unidentified air force official who had been working with the 
company told the panels staff that in his opinion mcdonnell 
douglas management was committing corporate suicide dingell 
said 
the official said the options left to the air force were to 
either suspend or significantly cut progress payments on the c17 
program but a financial analysis of the company concluded that if 
the payments were cut mcdonnell douglas might go bankrupt 
regardless of the progress payments issue the air force 
believes that mcdonnell douglas may go bankrupt by the end of the 
year dingell said in the letter 
he also cited internal pentagon reports that estimated the 
c17s cost at more than 400 million per plane air force 
officials testified to congress last june that the plane which 
will replace the current c141 aircraft will cost an estimated 
249 million 
richard hill a mcdonnell douglas spokesman in long beach 
calif said the company has estimated that when the c17 program 
is completed the cost will be below the ceiling levels in the 
government contract 
hill acknowledged past reports of schedule problems and delays 
but said that since november 1989 the company has met every 
milestone set in the past few months the landing gear was placed 
on the airplane its going to fly in june the progress is 
there 
hill declined to comment on the bankruptcy issue 
mcdonnell douglas in an internal report dated april 1990 
estimated a cost overrun of 836 million on the c17 contract in 
the last month however the contractor spent 118 million to 
complete work that was estimated at 47 million 
overhead expenses of 51 million in the internal report far 
exceeded the cost of 15 million while administrative expenses of 
9 million were about three times the projected cost of 3 million 
dingell in his letter to rep les aspin dwis chairman of 
the house armed services committee bristled at the number of hours 
it took to produce work that mcdonnell douglas own industrial 
engineers said should take only one 
for example he said 258 assembly hours were spent on the 
aircraft when one was determined to be sufficient 
we found an appalling picture in factory labor performance 
dingell said 
problems with the program were raised in june when the air force 
decided to take away the approval it had previously granted to 
mcdonnell douglas on its purchasing system for the c17 
the decision meant the company must get air force approval for 
purchases in excess of 100000 the air force told congress that 
the action would not delay the program 
nevertheless concerns about the program prompted the senate in 
adopting a 289 billion defense authorization bill last month to 
defer buying two planes in fiscal 1991 because of development and 
testing delays 
the house in a 283 billion defense bill approved last week 
cut president bushs request for about 700 million for the two 
planes to about 500 million 
but the house also restricted spending any money in the fiscal 
year beginning next monday until defense secretary dick cheney 
certifies the successful completion of the first flight of the 
production aircraft

intense political differences over abortion 
derailed a bill in the senate that would extend a 20yearold law 
providing federal aid to clinics that offer family planning 
services to the poor 
the senate adopted provisions sought by both opponents of 
abortion and advocates of abortion rights in two days of debate 
but then pushed the bill aside wednesday when a vote to limit 
debate failed 
i dont think a bill on family planning services is going to 
clear congress after this said doug johnson legislative 
director of the antiabortion national right to life committee 
the bill would renew the family planning programs funded under 
title x of the public health service act its authorization 
actually expired five years ago and the services have been 
continued each year through passage of catchall spending bills but 
advocates sought reauthorization with increases in federal support 
the senate on tuesday approved 6236 an amendment that would 
nullify bush administration regulations prohibiting family planning 
clinics that receive federal money from offering any information or 
counseling involving abortion legal challenges to those 
regulations are before the supreme court 
on wednesday the senate accepted an amendment requiring the 
notification of the parents of any girl under age 18 who seeks an 
abortion from an organization receiving federal familyplanning 
money 
the measure sponsored by sen william armstrong rcolo an 
abortion opponent was passed on a unanimous voice vote but the 
key vote came earlier when the senate rejected 5443 a motion to 
table or kill the amendment 
the family planning organizations are prohibited from using 
federal money for abortions but armstrong said more than 30 
perform abortions at the same clinic that provides federally 
supported family planning services 
in almost every jurisdiction you have to have the permission 
of your parent to give blood he said but there is a 
surgical procedure for which that is not required and it is 
abortion 
when backers sought a vote to set a time to end debate a move 
needed to bring the overall bill to a direct vote they failed by 
10 votes to get the required 60 votes 
sen edward kennedy dmass the bills sponsor said the 
action means the senate turns our back on millions of 
teenagers 
but sen orrin hatch rutah suggested democrats had only 
pushed the bill to force president bushs veto and said the 
services would again be funded regardless of the bills outcome 
nobody is going to be denied those funds hatch said 
in the house meanwhile a similar measure was approved by the 
energy and commerce committee without any of the controversial 
senate provisions on abortion

bernard gifford is a product of a government 
push 30 years ago to create more nuclear scientists so he is 
convinced that congress can propel his idea to put technology 
specialists in each school district 
gifford vice president of education marketing for apple 
computer inc addressed more than 70 members of congress on 
wednesday 
i believe the time has come for universities and school 
districts to create a new job that of chief technology officer on 
the same par as an academic dean or superintendent of 
instruction he said 
gifford said such a the technology officer would be far more 
than just a person in charge of computers but also one who 
understands the use of technology and have visions of where were 
headed 
my argument is we will not understand how to use the 
technology or how to implement it unless we create people at a high 
enough level whose obligation it is to add intelligence to the 
technology he said 
gifford said there are only about a few million computers in use 
in the nations schools for the 44 million students in public and 
private primary and secondary schools rapid advancement of 
technology makes it difficult for schools to keep their equipment 
up to date and many of the teachers are not adequately trained to 
use the sophisticated technology 
asked about the cost of his idea gifford acknowledged the tight 
budget problems but stressed said congress is in a unique 
position to champion the development 
the federal government in the past has stimulated the creation 
of a generation of specialists in eastern european languages 
molecular biology and nuclear science when there was a great need 
for those professions he said 
just as the government encouraged a generation to pursue those 
scholarly pursuits i hope similar incentives will be available for 
those educators who want to guide schools and colleges into the 
information age he said 
when the government pushed in the 1960s for more nuclear 
scientists gifford said he received a fellowship that paid his way 
through graduate school and gave him a 4000 yearly stipend 
all i had to do was major in biophysics said gifford a 
brooklyn native who has worked as a teacher a deputy commissioner 
of education for new york city public schools and dean of the 
school of education at the university of california at berkeley

blacks are breaking down the iron curtain 
that once barred them from important jobs in the television and 
movie industries but more progress is needed the naacp said in 
joining a campaign to keep the multiracial daytime drama 
generations on the air 
the 17monthold soap opera which employs many blacks in front 
of and behind the cameras is being dropped by some stations 
nationwide and needs public support naacp officials said at a news 
conference wednesday 
generations costar jonelle allen who received a 
congressional citation for her work from rep mervyn dymally 
dcalif urged viewers to contact their local nbcaffiliated 
stations and let it be known that you love generations 
benjamin l hooks executive director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people was too ill to 
attend the news conference but sent a message that was read by an 
aide bill pollard 
while it is agreed that african americans have made some 
strides in the breaking through what was previously an iron curtain 
that prevented them from exercising any real power in these 
industries it is obvious a great deal still remains to be done 
hooks said we are therefore in total support of any and all 
efforts that will accomplish these goals 
generations deals with two families one black the other 
white with multigenerational ties nbc describes it as the first 
daytime drama to focus equally on two families of different races 
pollard said the american public needs to see blacks portrayed 
as we are every day and not as a subclass or a second class 
he said the naacp would urge its 1700 chapters to lobby nbc 
affiliates to try to prevent generations from being dropped 
from any more daytime lineups 
sally sussman the shows creatorexecutive producer said 
generations was broadcast on 99 percent of nbcs 200plus 
affiliated stations after it debuted in march 1989 but now it is 
seen on 92 percent of the stations 
she said that even though the network totally supports the 
program it had been dropped recently by nbc affiliates in boston 
phoenix tulsa okla and tampast petersburg fla 
if more defections occur sussman said at some point it will 
not be economically feasible for nbc to carry the show 
nbc officials did not immediately comment wednesday but nbc 
entertainment group chairman brandon tartikoff was quoted recently 
as saying he would give the show six more months before 
reevaluating its future

south africa has been developing nuclear 
weapons for years and may have begun producing them in 1979 or 
earlier says a newly disclosed cia document 
the memorandum obtained by the environmentalist natural 
resources defense council under the freedom of information act was 
written in december 1979 at the request of the national security 
council it sought to determine who was responsible for a nuclear 
explosion detected on sept 22 1979 by a us vela satellite off 
the african coast 
the document did not appear to present a conclusive answer 
unless it was hidden in the portions that were blacked out for 
reasons of national security while all the intelligence agencies 
appeared to agree south africa could have done it they differed on 
whether it did 
late in 1977 the cia found the south african government 
suspended preparations to test a nuclear weapon because of strong 
pressure from the united states 
but the cia said it didnt believe south african denials about 
the 1979 explosion 
the commander of the south african navy made allegations 
which we believe to be false that a soviet nuclear submarine has 
been seen in the vicinity implicitly denying that the south 
african navy was involved in a nuclear test conducted at sea the 
memo said 
the defense intelligence agency an arm of the defense 
department believes that south africa probably would have had 
enough confidence in israeli security to consider conducting a 
joint test 
south africa and israel both ostracized on the international 
stage in the 1970s have cooperated on many defense projects under 
strong international pressure israel promised last year to stop 
israelis have not only participated in certain south african 
nuclear research activities over the last few years but they have 
also offered and transferred various sorts of advanced nonnuclear 
weapons technology to south africa the cia said in the 1979 
report 
the natural resources defense council said wednesday it was 
making the document public to prevent south africa from hiding 
large amounts of enriched uranium from international inspection 
south africa has announced it wants to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty which would place its nuclear facilities 
under international inspection to ensure they were only used for 
nonmilitary purposes 
if theyre going to sign this treaty lets not forget they 
had this program way back when lets get accountability for what 
they produced then said richard fieldhouse a nuclear 
proliferation specialist at nrdc 
south africa has cloaked its nuclear program in secrecy and 
ambiguity over the years preferring to keep its adversaries 
guessing 
the 1979 memo said that until recently south africa lacked 
the relevant technology and fissile material but estimated it 
has by this time acquired sufficient fissile material for the 
fabrication of several nuclear devices 
one fissile material is uranium that is enriched to such a 
concentrated level that it can be used to make weapons south 
africa is the worlds third largest producer of uranium 
south african president fw de klerk visited the white house 
ths week and the united states pressed again for his country to 
sign the nonproliferation treaty officials said 
last week the customs service accused an export business in 
florida of selling longrange ballistic missile guidance components 
to south africa for at least the last year 
in its affidavit against the company york ltd the agency said 
it was aware of projects under way relating to the development of 
guided missile delivery systems for standard and nuclear weapons 
in south africa

the sixweekold un economic embargo 
has not kept iraq from receiving food and supplies by truck from 
jordan jetliner from south america via smugglers from syria and 
iran and even by mule from turkey 
the embargo has halted virtually all of iraqs oil exports and 
drastically reduced cargo shipments to the country but supplies 
are slipping in thanks to sympathetic governments proiraqi groups 
and opportunistic smugglers 
there are a lot of ways for an innovative shipper to avoid a 
blockade and as the price goes up they become more innovative 
said capt paul prokop commander of us coast guard teams 
enforcing the embargo in the persian gulf 
the amount of slippage is difficult to determine before iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 prompting the international community to 
impose the sanctions it imported about threequarters of its food 
supplies 
the trade cutoff has forced strict rationing but embargo 
violators may help iraq resist the pressure aimed at forcing it to 
quit kuwait 
while the united nations authorized the naval blockade the air 
embargo it approved this week does not condone military enforcement 
and little is being done to stop overland shipments through 
neighboring jordan and iran 
jordans king hussein an ally of iraqi president saddam 
hussein has reluctantly agreed to honor the boycott but much food 
is believed to be going in through jordan 
a convoy of trucks loaded with food left jordan for iraq on 
monday to raucous cheers in one of the more defiant gestures 
flouting the embargo 
western officials believe libya sudan and yemen are also 
sending food 
most aircraft flying to iraq would have to cross jordanian 
airspace possibly filing bogus flight plans for jordan then 
continuing to iraq 
iran has a 730mile border with iraq and is believed to be 
allowing food across overland routes 
officially iran says it supports the un embargo on monday 
it announced the arrest of 29 people for smuggling rice flour 
dates oil and other foodstuffs into iraq 
but tehran baghdads foe in an eightyear war than ended in 
1988 shares iraqs opposition to the us military presence in the 
gulf and there is heated internal debate over whether to help iraq 
beat the sanctions 
iranian newspapers have suggested that tehran send 
humanitarian shipments of food and medicine and there have 
been reports that iran has struck a deal with iraq to trade refined 
oil for food 
baghdad residents say food appearing recently in markets in the 
iraqi capital has come from neighboring iran 
also some shipping sources say iraqi tankers are delivering oil 
to ports in iran by hugging the coastline and staying out of 
international waters 
syrian president hafez assad iraqs major rival in the arab 
world made a weekend trip to iran to try to persuade leaders in 
tehran to better cooperate with international efforts to isolate 
iraq 
but he was unable to obtain a pledge to abide by the un 
sanctions 
there are also illegal food shipments from turkey which 
strongly backs us policy in the region the number of trucks 
carrying food into iraq has tripled since the embargo was imposed 
cumhuriyet a major turkish newspaper reported over the weekend 
it quoted the owner of a meat exporting firm as saying turkish 
trucks carrying cattle to iran were diverted to iraq by iranian 
border guards 
other turkish media reports say smugglers carry contraband 
foodstuff by mule across the mountainous border region which is 
difficult to police and notorious for such activity 
smallscale smuggling from syria also has been reported in 
recent weeks consisting mainly of opportunisic farmers selling 
their produce across the common border 
even the air embargo adopted tuesday by a 141 vote at the un 
security council is largely symbolic as it cannot be effectively 
enforced the united nations does not allow the shooting down of 
civilian passenger aircraft 
in one brazen example of defying the sanctions an argentinian 
presidential adviser on saturday acknowledged sending 154 tons of 
beef to iraq over the past two weeks 
president carlos menem fired the adviser alberto samid for the 
embarrassing admission made more acute because argentina has 
pledged two warships to the multinational force standing up to 
saddam in the gulf region 
samid said the beef was flown to iran for overland delivery to 
iraq although irans foreign ministry claimed no knowledge of the 
deal 
but experts say saddam cannot rely on airlifts to feed his 
nation of 17 million people nor will his order this week to 
farmers to devote 80 percent of their land to wheat help much 
according to us agriculture department officials

massachusetts institute of technology has 
replaced bennington college of vermont as the nations most 
expensive college with total expenses nearly 23000 a year a 
survey shows 
overall college costs this fall rose an average of 5 percent to 
8 percent continuing a sixyear moderating trend according to the 
annual college board survey released wednesday 
but with a possible recession and resurgent inflation some 
college officials fear tuition may climb more sharply in the next 
few years 
the survey found that fixed charges at fouryear private 
institutions including tuition fees room and board average 
13544 an 8 percent increase from last years 12557 the 
increase a year ago was 9 percent 
the priciest such school mit costs an estimated 22945 
counting tuition fees room and board books and supplies 
transportation and other expenses 
bennington a small selective liberal arts college had been 
the most expensive private college every year since the 198586 
school year mit was tops for the three years before that 
this year bennington is fifth at 22550 yale university is 
second at 22900 new york university third at 22775 and 
brandeis university fourth at 22690 
rounding out the top 10 in order are harvard and radcliffe 
colleges boston university sarah lawrence college columbia 
university and stanford university all cost more than 22000 a 
year 
several of the highestpriced schools however posted some of 
their smallest tuition increases in years columbias rates were up 
just 57 percent stanfords 525 percent 
at fouryear public universities fixed costs including room and 
board average 4970 up 5 percent from 4715 
at twoyear private colleges fixed costs including room and 
board average 8484 up 7 percent from 7912 last year 
tuition and fees at twoyear public institutions average 884 
up 5 percent from last years 841 few such institutions provide 
room and board 
the surveys averages are weighted to take enrollment into 
account colleges with large enrollments count more heavily than 
smaller schools 
at their worst costs at public and private institutions rose in 
double digits from 1981 through 1984 rates at fouryear public 
colleges shot up 20 percent in 198283 they settled into the 5 
percent to 9 percent range the past six years 
richard rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities in washington labeled the 
moderation in cost increases progress though not dramatic 
wed never expect to see the increases fall sharply he 
said 
but resurgent inflation and a looming recession could upset the 
pattern rosser said universities in northern states especially 
will probably feel the pinch of rising oil prices 
arthur hauptman author of the recently published book the 
college tuition spiral agreed 
assuming there is a decent jump in inflation i would expect 
that this would lead to tuitions not further reducing themselves 
and they might well go up though not as fast as the overall 
inflation rate said hauptman a consultant to the american 
council on education 
he added that a recession might cause sharper tuition hikes at 
public universities especially since economic downturns often 
prompt states to cut education spending 
in response to the survey us secretary of education lauro f 
cavazos urged parents to save money and familiarize themselves with 
financial aid sources 
while the rapid rise of college costs experienced in the 1980s 
has slowed many still perceive these costs as beyond their 
financial reach he said in a statement 
nearly half of all families with collegeage students receive 
public or private loans and grants which totaled about 28 billion 
last year the college board said 
the college board is a private nonprofit education association 
whose members include more than 2600 colleges school systems and 
other education associations

the battle for dan quayles old senate 
seat pits wellfinanced republican incumbent dan coats against an 
obscure state legislator who took a 400mile hike to meet indiana 
voters 
baron hill won the democratic nomination to challenge coats only 
after two betterknown democrats decided not to run 
coats a former congressman has a comfortable lead over hill in 
recent polls and a 900000 bank balance heading into the fall 
campaign 
hill a businessman at a familyowned insurance and real estate 
agency is short on campaign money 
the flamboyant hill resorted to literally walking the campaign 
trail hiking north from the ohio river to lake michigan where he 
dived into 60degree water 
whatever happens this has been a great experience for me 
hill said as he dried off 
hills camp disputes polling daa showing coats with a wide 
lead 
thats nuts said tim phillips the democrats campaign 
manager who says the undecided vote is actually above 40 percent 
coats was appointed to the senate seat last year after quayle 
resigned to become vice president state law required a special 
election this year the winner will face reelection in 1992 the 
year quayles term was to expire 
in a march 1989 special election for coats congressional seat 
democrat jill long captured the heavily republican district which 
had once been held by quayle longs victory stunned gop chairman 
lee atwater and others in the party 
hill and jill democrats in 1990 reads a political slogan 
summarizing democrats hopes 
hill attacked coats early for supposedly lavish office expenses 
and taking generous advantage of the franking privilege to send 
voters millions of pieces of mail a hill television spot showed a 
farmer opening his mailbox only to be blown back by a rushing 
torrent of coats mailings 
a radio spot even offhandedly suggested the mailings posed an 
environmental threat by clogging landfills 
that didnt stop the coats mailings but the senator soon took 
the offensive on an environmental issue sponsoring legislation to 
stop outofstate trash haulers many identified as new jersey 
haulers from using indiana landfills 
hills tv spot grabbed enough voter attention to put coats on 
the defensive said political pollster brian s vargus so 
coats came back with his new jersey garbage men 
coats lately has concentrated on employing the perks and powers 
of incumbency to woo support 
the outofstate trash legislation passed sept 18 and two days 
later coats upstaged the opposition by handing the democratic mayor 
of gary ind a 25 million check for an airport expansion hes 
even scrounged for money to save a local army reserve center 
coats is better known than hill but hasnt proven he can draw 
voters outside his former congressional district 
im pretty well convinced that a large proportion of the 
electorate arent even aware at this point theres an election in 
november says vargus 
coats has struggled to build the loyal following he will need to 
win if voter turnout is low 
name recognition does not always translate into political 
recognition says vargus a sociologist at indiana 
universitypurdue university at indianapolis who predicted quayles 
largely unexpected senate victory in 1980 even if supporters 
say they approve they dont necessarily vote 
the upset victory of boston university president john silber 
over former state attorney general francis bellotti in the 
democratic primary for governor raises warning flags for incumbents 
everywhere says vargus 
lightning can strike that does prove it said vargus

legislation authorizing new water projects for 
flood control storm damage reduction inland navigation and port 
development in 18 states and puerto rico is heading to a conference 
committee 
a bill approved 35055 by the house on wednesday will be taken 
up by a joint housesenate panel soon to blend with similar 
legislation passed by the senate 
however the 25 billion package of 25 army corps of engineers 
water projects still must get over some other hurdles before work 
can begin 
the projects are to be joint statefederal efforts but no 
federal money has been appropriated yet and president bush has 
threatened to veto the bill in its present form 
by far the most expensive project in the house bill is a 12 
billion flood control effort in new jersey that would divert waters 
from the northern passaic valley into newark bay 
the project with an estimated federal cost of 890 million 
calls for construction of two large tunnels to divert water 
modifications to the channels of the passaic river and its 
tributaries and construction of levees and floodwalls 
rep robert a roe of wayne nj ranking member of the house 
public works and transportation committee hailed passage as a 
major step in protecting the lives and property of the residents 
of the passaic river valley 
a 1984 flood in the area cost three lives forced the evacuation 
of 9000 residents and caused an estimated 355 million in damage 
to homes and businesses 
flood tunnel opponents have urged the federal government to buy 
the property but several new jersey members of congress say the 
purchase would cost about 46 billion three times more than the 
flood tunnel 
another major project in the bill is a 545 million flood 
control effort in the buffalo bayou and its tributaries in texas 
encompassing most of the houston metropolitan area 
as an authorization bill the measure does not directly result 
in expenditures in order for the authorized money to be spent it 
must be appropriated later in other legislation 
the bush administration has threatened to veto the bill for a 
number of reasons including environmental and economic feasibility 
of some of the projects 
the administration also opposes federal responsibility for 
developing recreation facilities replacing a bridge levee 
beautification and agricultural land improvements required in some 
of the projects 
other projects authorized in the bill are 
navigation work for bayou la batre ala

security forces in zaire continue to violently 
repress government opponents despite recent promises to expand the 
oneparty political system and make other reforms amnesty 
international charged today 
although abuses have diminished in recent years incidents of 
banishment torture and detentions without charge or trial are 
coming to light the international human rights group said in a 
report 
appeals to the government to investigate these incidents have 
been ignored and the authorities have shown themselves unwilling to 
take disciplinary action against security forces the group 
said 
the government of president mobutu sese seko which has ruled 
the central african country since 1965 last spring promised a 
series of political reforms 
in april mobutu made a series of improvements including giving 
citizens the right to form opposition political parties and trade 
unions 
in may he promised an end to internal banishment and 
incommunicado detention and the release of all uncharged political 
prisoners pledges which remain unfulfilled said the londonbased

the zairean security services which are directly responsible 
to the president maintain extensive powers to arrest and detain 
political suspects and hold them in arbitrary and incommunicado 
detention where many have been illtreated and tortured amnesty 
said 
security forces involved in the abuses include a special service 
responsible for immigration an elite presidential guard and a 
paramilitary police group which helps to control borders it said 
since january 1988 amnesty has received reports of several 
hundred people arrested and imprisoned for political reasons the

most of those targeted are members of the opposition union for 
democracy and social progress in july more than 12 members were 
arrested and some were allegedly beaten while holding a meeting 
said the human rights group it did not detail whether the members 
were detained 
security forces have also killed government opponents the 
report says 
most recently the forces were implicated in the reported 
killing of at least 12 students on may 1112 at lubumbashi 
university it says 
the government initially denied responsibility for the killings 
but a parliamentary inquiry led to the arrests of the governor of 
the shaba region and other government officials 
belgium zaires former colonial ruler has called for an 
international investigation of the incident and zaires refusal has 
helped sour relations between the countries amnesty said 
in addition at least five students were reportedly killed in 
february 1989 when soldiers dispersed unarmed demonstrators at 
kinshasa said the report

the senate has effectively killed the motor 
voter bill which would link voter registration to filling out 
applications for drivers licenses 
the senate voted 5542 wednesday to limit debate on the question 
of whether to take up the legislation the margin was five votes 
short of the 60 needed 
the senate will revisit this measure in the next congress 
said sen wendell ford dky the chief sponsor 
it provides that individuals would automatically be registered 
as voters when applying for drivers licenses to avoid becoming 
registered they could check off a box designated for that purpose 
on the license application 
state governments would have to use the same forms to license 
drivers and register voters 
voters also could register through the mail and at the offices 
of various federal agencies 
backers of the measure say the needy and unsophisticated are 
discouraged by difficult and overly complex registration procedures 
in many communities 
critics say the legislation could lead to voter fraud they 
questioned whether safeguards would be effective which are designed 
to verify that those who register actually live where they say they 
do 
democratic leaders wanted a time limit on debate fearing that 
the bills largely republican critics would talk it to death by 
filibustering with only a few weeks left in this years 
congressional session 
among republicans only oregon sens mark hatfield and bob 
packwood voted in favor of taking up the bill three others did not 
vote sens david durenberger of minnesota mitch mcconnell of 
kentucky and pete wilson of california 
all other republicans were opposed while the measure was 
supported by all but two democrats sens max baucus of montana 
and howell heflin of alabama 
similar legislation was passed by the house on feb 6 with 
bipartisan support 
next year ford will continue the fight to strengthen our 
democratic process by making the voting booth more accessible to 
all americans he said in a statement 
lawmakers acted out of fear that registering millions more 
voters would upset the political status quo league of women 
voters president susan s lederman said in a statement 
i think voters will find it unacceptable that the same 
legislators who argue so righteously for greater turnouts on 
election day vote to kill the one bill that would make voter 
registration fairer and simpler she said

american taxpayers have paid 194 billion to 
store oil in six underground salt caverns in louisiana and texas 
now they will get their first payback 
president bushs decision wednesday to tap the strategic 
petroleum reserve for 5 million barrels of oil in hopes of calming 
soaring prices is the first time the countrys petroleum safety 
net has been put to use 
the reserve has a rocky history and its existence stems from 
this countrys first major oil shock the arab oil embargo in 
197374 that first brought home to millions of americans the 
dangers of relying too heavily on foreign oil 
it is the first use of the oil reserve as an economic weapon 
although the government tapped it for 1 million barrels of crude in 
1985 to test the system a year later the reagan administration 
used the threat of a drawdown to curtail a price spiral that was 
occurring because of the iraniraq war industry analysts said 
congress authorized the petroleum reserve in 1975 and the first 
drop of oil went into storage areas two years later over the 
years a series of salt caverns were excavated along the texas and 
louisiana coasts to store the oil 590 million barrels as of 
today 
creation of the reserve has been a massive undertaking early 
oil shipments went into abandoned salt mines when those were 
filled the caverns were carved out of rockhard salt through 
massive injection of water oil does not dissolve salt so the salt 
created a permanent subterranean enclosure 
a typical cavern is 2500 feet high and 246 feet wide about as 
wide and more than twice as tall as the world trade center in new 
york city 
creation of the reserve has not been without its problems and 
controversies originally envisioned to cost 6 billion to 7 
billion the price tag is close to 20 billion and rising congress 
recently voted to enlarge the reserve from a maximum of 750 million 
barrels to 1 billion barrels by the end of the decade 
there have been huge cost overruns and delays originally the 
reserve was scheduled to have been full by this year instead it 
is about 150 million barrels short of the goal 
over the years there have been charges of fraud and 
mismanagement millions of dollars of equipment missing 
allegations that inferior oil even toxic waste was being put 
into the salt caverns the government was accused of paying 
inflated prices for oil 
when oil was cheap briefly in the late 1970s the government 
wanted to speed up filling the reserve but couldnt build new 
caverns fast enough to take advantage of the low price 
and when the second oil shock hit in 1979 with the fall of the 
shah in iran prices soared and the carter administration suspended 
purchases for the reserve altogether 
the reagan administration repeatedly sparred with congress over 
how much oil to put into the reserve in 1984 the administration 
sought to again halt purchases arguing that petroleum was too 
expensive and the purchases were a drain on the budget congress 
disagreed 
today the reserve holds 590 million barrels of oil enough to 
supply the country for 73 days should there be a total cutoff of 
oil imports 
the government must buy oil on the open market for the reserve 
much of it has come from mexico and british fields in the north 
sea only 66 percent is domestically produced 
the salt caverns are connected by a maze of pipelines that can 
be directly connected to commercial refinery distribution systems 
officials said it would take 16 days for the energy department to 
award oil contracts under an auction system 
the reserve can make available 35 million barrels of oil a day 
when in full operation bush has only asked for 5 million barrels 
as a test designed to send a signal to the petroleum markets 
according to officials

president bush is warning that hardfought 
clean air legislation may fall apart unless congress steps up 
efforts to work out a compromise 
the president wednesday bemoaned the slow progress of 
housesenate negotiations on a final clean air package and offered 
a compromise proposal to help break the logjam that once again 
has appeared 
house and senate members have been struggling since early july 
to resolve differences in separate clean air bills that won 
overwhelming approval in each chamber earlier this year 
the legislation which calls for tough new air pollution 
controls on factories electric utilities and automobiles 
represents the first tightening of federal air pollution laws in 13 
years 
but the talks have bogged down on details of the massive 
legislation 
in a letter to the leaders of the house and senate negotiating 
teams the president said the talks have strayed away from what the 
administration wants and that the slow progress may 
jeopardize enactment of a bill before congress adjourns next 
month 
the administrations new plan took provisions from both the 
house and senate bills did not contain any new initiatives 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house delegation 
said he wondered why the administration didnt send up the proposal 
when the issue was before the house last spring 
environmentalists also were not impressed by the white house 
initiative they picked the weakest part of each bill except on 
acid rain said daniel weiss who has followed the clean air 
debate for the sierra club 
administration officials said their new proposal was 3 billion 
cheaper than either the house or senate bill the white house all 
along has expressed concern about the cost of the widereaching air 
pollution controls estimating that both the senate and house 
versions will cost industry more than 25 billion a year when all 
the new requirements take effect 
while there is general agreement between both the house and 
senate on tough new controls to reduce acid rain toxic industrial 
chemical releases and urban smog disagreements remain on details 
in each of these areas 
were concerned that theyre not taking action fast enough 
said william rosenberg an assistant administrator at the 
environmental protection agency he characterized the 
administration proposal as an attempt to bridge the gap between 
the house and senate 
a white house official acknowledged that the proposal in part 
was an attempt to get the bush administration more closely involved 
in the clean air discussions on capitol hill 
the president has been frozen out in the process and the 
results have been stalemated said the official who spoke under 
the condition that he not be named he said the view from the white 
house was that the clock is ticking and the conferees were not 
delivering 
earlier this month the negotiators announced a tentative 
agreement on reducing smogcausing pollution from industrial 
sources and on permitting requirements for industry previously 
they reached agreement on how to deal with chemicals that damage 
the atmospheric ozone layer 
but the two sides have yet to take up in detail a number of 
other controversial issues including how far to go to ensure the 
public protection from toxic chemical releases by industry and 
whether to provide jobloss assistance to workers who become 
unemployed because of the tougher pollution controls

subway gunman bernhard goetz contradicting the 
defense that got him acquitted in 1987 conceded he stuck his gun 
in a wounded teenagers ribs and shot him telling the victim 
you dont look too bad heres another 
goetz in a deposition released wednesday also undercut defense 
attorney barry slotnicks assertion at trial that the gunman never 
hesitated between shots when he opened fire on four young men in a 
subway car in 1984 
goetz who is white also acknowledged making racist comments 
before the day he shot the black teenagers 
the deposition is part of a 50 million lawsuit filed against 
goetz by one of his victims darrell cabey 22 
i hope the jurors in that trial wake up screaming in the night 
when they read this said attorney william kunstler who 
questioned goetz for cabey 
cabey was left paralyzed and brain damaged by goetz the three 
other youths recovered and were later arrested on various criminal 
charges goetz asserts he fired because the four were about to mug 
him 
goetz 42 was acquitted of attempted murder assault and other 
charges he served 8 months in jail for a weapons offense 
he never testified at his trial answering questions under oath 
monday for the first time about the shootings 
goetz said he was on the subway less than 30 seconds before 
opening fire with his 38caliber revolver kunstler asked goetz 
about the last shot he fired at cabey who was struggling to get 
out of a seat 
i walked directly in front of that person put the gun in his 
ribs and pulled the trigger again with the words you dont look 
too bad heres another goetz replied 
after his arrest in new hampshire he was videotaped by police 
as giving a similar account 
slotnick had argued at goetzs trial that his client 
fantasized making that statement slotnick also argued that 
goetz emptied his gun rapidfire without pause meaning he could 
not have spoken to anyone before firing 
the mind of bernhard goetz full of stress and fear might 
have recounted a lot of things that didnt actually happen 
slotnick told the jury 
goetz specifically repudiated that and said he stood by all the 
statements he made on the new hampshire video he had also told 
police there he wanted to gouge out the eyes of one of his victims 
goetz also was asked by ronald kuby cabeys cocounsel did 
you say at a block meeting or community meeting or building 
meeting in words or substance the only way we are going to clean 
up the street is to get rid of the spics and niggers 
yes i did goetz responded that was at a community 
meeting 
cabeys lawyers believe this demonstrates racism was at play 
when goetz opened fire 
the youths said they didnt plan to rob goetz and that they were 
only panhandling for money to play video games 
goetz also discussed his finances his defense fund collected 
about 60000 in donations his annual income since the shooting 
has dropped from as high as 100000 to about 20000 and his 
assets are down from 250000 to 6000

heres a political prediction that can 
be taken to the bank question j on the montgomery county md 
ballot will pass nov 6 overwhelmingly 
one elderly couple who are the only voters eligible to cast 
ballots on the issue guarantee it 
sometime before polls close nov 6 montgomery county elections 
administrator doug jernigan will type out two ballots and 
personally deliver them to martin and mildred darnall 
those ballots will be unique because theyll be the only ones 
containing question j which would put the hitching post restaurant 
back into prince georges county 
since the darnalls are the only property owners affected they 
are the only eligible voters 
while the ballot question is not the most burning issue of the 
political season for mrs darnall itll mean a chance to putter 
around the garden 
the darnalls have owned the combination cafeliquor store near 
burtonsville md for more than 41 years and theyve been ready 
to retire for four years now 
i got sick i had a real bad time i was a cancer patient 
recalled mrs darnall 73 in a telephone interview with our age 
and the physical handicaps we thought we should sell we had 
numerous buyers just hollering to buy the place 
but when negotiations began to get serious mrs darnall and her 
75yearold husband were shocked to learn their establishment was 
part of montgomery county 
for nearly four decades the darnalls thought they were part of 
prince georges county they paid taxes to prince georges county 
they were registered to vote in prince georges and their liquor 
license was issued by prince georges county 
but in the early 1980s there was a slight shifting on the 
boundary between the two counties and the darnalls werent 
informed 
the difference is significant for wouldbe buyers montgomerys 
zoning and liquor control ordinances are much stricter than 
neighboring prince georges instead of making an easy sale the 
darnalls became frustrated as one prospective buyer after another 
lost interest after learning they would be subject to montgomery 
county regulations 
so the darnalls enlisted the help of state delegate sheila ellis 
hixson dmontgomery who pushed a bill through the general 
assembly last spring that put question j on the ballot 
theres no doubt how the darnalls will vote mrs darnall is 
more concerned now about getting another buyer given the areas 
current real estate slump 
while she refused to reveal the asking price other sources say 
the property is worth slightly more than 1 million there have 
been no complaints on the price except now nobody has any 
money mrs darnall said 
if the couple is able to unload their business mrs darnall has 
her retirement planned 
id just like to one time in my life to have a house a garden 
and just live a normal life i just wanted to be a harried 
homeowner

bernard sanders the avowed socialist who 
is running for congress is calling for us troop reductions in 
the middle east 
sanders said president bush deserves credit for his initial 
handling of the crisis adding that he supports having other 
countries contribute more to the multinational force to prevent 
iraq from further expansion 
it is impossible of course to estimate what an effective 
un united nations force would number but my initial guess 
would be that it would not be necessary for the us to have more 
than 40000 to 50000 troops in the region said sanders his 
answers were in response to questions from three vermont 
newspapers 
in an interview wednesday sanders said he would like to see 
replacement of american troops with troops from europe 
i would like to see more of a presence from france and 
england he said 
sanders a former fourterm mayor of burlington is running 
against firstterm incumbent rep peter smith a republican 
sanders is running as an independent 
about 165000 us soldiers are stationed in the saudi desert 
and aboard ships in the region thousands of arab and european 
troops have also been deployed as part of the usled

californias republican candidate for 
governor threatened to fight fire with fire and crank up fund 
raising like his democratic opponent after a judge threw out limits 
on campaign contributions 
democrat dianne feinsteins staff began telling supporters 
wednesday they can exceed the states voterapproved limits because 
of the judges ruling 
us sen pete wilson who is thought to have a fundraising 
lead over feinstein challenged the former san francisco mayor to 
abide by the limits despite the ruling but he left open the 
possibility he also would exceed them 
we may have to fight fire with fire he said 
us district judge lawrence karlton on tuesday struck down as 
unconstitutional proposition 73 approved by voters in 1988 it 
allowed an individual to give up to 1000 per candidate per fiscal 
year it set higher limits for parties and political action 
committees 
dee dee myers a spokeswoman for feinstein said wilson as a 
senator had been able to set up a network of individual 
contributors 
were not going to abide by fundraising limits that have been 
thrown out as unconstitutional because its in pete wilsons 
advantage to do so she said he obviously has an interest in 
locking in the status quo 
meanwhile state officials urged a delay of the ruling which 
came six weeks before the nov 6 election 
the state fair political practices commission asked karlton to 
suspend his decision pending an appeal saying the ruling so close 
to the election would give an advantage to candidates who can 
raise large sums on short notice 
karlton refused to suspend the ruling immediately instead he 
scheduled a hearing on the motion for friday 
state sen quentin kopp and assembly minority leader ross 
johnson authors of the contribution limits asked an appeals court 
to delay the judges ruling saying the integrity of the 
electoral process could be at stake 
wilson who had only token opposition in the june primary 
reported raising 125 million through june and said he had 39 
million in the bank as of july 1 feinstein raised 81 million in 
the same period and had only 645344 left after defeating state 
attorney general john van de kamp in the primary 
spokesman for both candidates claimed not to know how much had 
been raised since june 
the california governors race has been targeted as a top 
priority of both national political parties because of the 
governors authority to sign or veto the congressional 
redistricting bill the 1991 legislature must enact 
california is expected to gain seven seats in congress based on 
the 1990 census boosting its delegation to 52 seats leaders of 
both parties say control of 10 or more of those seats could be 
determined by which party occupies the governors office

about the only thing getting a 
trim at charlenes house of beauty these days is charlenes 
profits 
for charlene luongo and other merchants who rely on the adjacent 
marine base for their livelihood the persian gulf crisis delivered 
a onetwo punch first the town lost thousands of marines then it 
lost many of their wives and girlfriends 
the way i understand it they went home to mama said ms 
luongo her beauty chair empty at midday ive lost about 50 
percent of my business 
the military wont give numbers but business officials guess at 
least 6000 marines left for saudi arabia about 12500 people live 
in twentynine palms and a like number at the marine corps training 
center the nations biggest marine base 
with such a large bite taken out of the local population signs 
of change are everywhere in this mojave desert city 140 miles east 
of los angeles in high desert terrain of jagged ridges and hills 
dotted with joshua trees 
streets are quieter many parking lots are vacant and 
everywhere theres yellow ribbon 
yellow ribbons are tied on front door handles taped to display 
windows and attached to car attennas even the gate to the pet 
motel on the outskirts of town has yellow ribbon fluttering in the 
warm desert wind 
the marines are very much a part of this community said ed 
haley a retired marine and owner of twentynine palms liquor where 
business is off 25 percent theyre sort of missed we do want to 
see more get here and we hope to get the others get back 
though shopkeepers are trying to remain optimistic business is 
down at least 20 percent at many stores according to the chamber 
of commerce merchants fear that unless the military sends more 
troops to the base some shops will close before years end 
the important thing is what the next step is going to be 
said bill gutgesell the citys community development director 
is it going to stay in limbo like this or will they complement 
the activity on the base and supply it with more reserves of 
course they dont tell us anything 
first and hardest hit were the businesses that cater directly to 
the marines tattoo parlors bars nightclubs tire stores barber 
shops that advertise regulation cuts and laundries with specials 
for uniforms 
other businesses also are feeling the pinch womens clothing 
shops convenience markets gas stations and fastfood restaurants 
the 150perceremony wedding chapel packed with couples in the 
early days of the deployment stands empty save for the white 
benches and peach bows 
mayor lester w krushat said the loss of troops has yet to be 
felt on the tax base of this young city incorporated in 1987 
but time will tell he said 
city leaders here are quick to point out that theirs is more 
than just a marine base community 
they say many residents are retirees drawn by the warm dry 
weather clean air and friendly neighbors the city also is near 
the joshua tree national monument a camping destination in 
october the town celebrates pioneer days an oldtime western 
festival 
yes business is down but well survive said karen van den 
hout executive director of the chamber of commerce our main 
concern is that these guys troops are supported that they know 
it and that they get back in one piece 
the deployment many residents say has been hardest on the 
young wives and girlfriends the women without children or any 
strong ties to the community 
the military sponsors counseling sessions and support groups for 
the women but many just packed up and went home to their parents 
officials estimate at least 5 percent of the marine dependents have 
left town 
to a young girl out here it seems a little difficult for them 
because theres not the things to do that theyre used to said 
grace jernigan at something special an arts and crafts store 
something special owned by jernigans daughter is one of the 
few stores where business hasnt dropped she said many women in 
town are turning to such hobbies as needlepoint and quiltmaking 
its good therapy said jernigan if you keep your mind 
off things youre not sitting around worried all the time

it was triumph over tragedy for baritone juan 
pons who portrayed the title role in the first of 11 performances 
of rigoletto by the metropolitan opera this season 
pons stood out among the cast wednesday night as the hunchbacked 
court buffoon in giuseppe verdis tragic masterpiece so what if he 
shouldnt have stood so straight his voice was great 
he sounded convincingly tormented in his act 1 solo after he is 
cursed 
particularly compelling was his duet at the end of act 2 with 
soprano june anderson who portrayed rigolettos daughter gilda 
although miss anderson had some trouble with the high notes 
throughout the night her act 1 solo especially the cadenza and 
trill just before gildas abduction was just heavenly 
the story based on victor hugos play le roi samuse is 
set in 16th century italy and begins at the duke of mantuas 
palace whats supposed to be an orgy led by the womanizing duke 
actually seemed a bit tame in the otto schenk production 
the duke already has seduced the daughter of count monterone 
paws the wife of a courtier and lusts for the maiden he has 
spotted in church monterone bursts into the party and after being 
derided by rigoletto responds by vowing maledetto revenge 
after the duke finds out the maiden is his jesters daghter 
she is abducted with the unwitting help of rigoletto cries the 
clown ah la maledizione the curse 
gilda is carried back to the palace is conquered by the duke 
and tells all to her father still she says she loves the duke 
rigoletto eventually hires an assassin to kill his employer but 
his daughter is murdered instead after the assassins sister 
maddelena is courted by the duke 
bass nicolai ghiaurov as the unscrupulous hitman sparafucile 
gave a brawny performance wendy white was an especially tempting 
maddelena and the boyish conductor guido ajmonemarsan did a firm 
job melding the large ensemble in his metropolitan opera debut 
somewhat disappointing was tenor jerry hadley as the duke of 
mantua hes a good actor but he sounded nasal at times he got 
off to a weak start with the aria questa o quella and during 
the operas most famous aria la donna e mobile in act 3 his 
voice just didnt project 
baritone alan held who played monterone had the opposite 
problem his voice was solid but his acting was a bit wooden 
especially when he cast the hex on rigoletto 
the scenery slightly different than last years was realistic 
and the sky looked especially ominous 
the mets other performances of rigoletto are sept 29 oct 
3 6 16 20 23 26 jan 4 9 and 12

earthquake that rattled people in six states saying it isnt 
necessarily a precursor to the catastrophic big one predicted for 
december 
no major damage or injuries were reported from wednesday 
mornings quake or a second smaller one that night the quakes 
felt in missouri arkansas illinois kentucky tennessee and 
indiana were in the new madrid fault zone 
for months people along the seismic zone have been worrying 
about scientist iben brownings contention that theres a 5050 
chance for a major quake there on or about dec 3 many scientists 
have dismissed the prediction 
doug wiens professor of earth and planetary sciences at 
washington university in st louis said there is no extra cause 
for alarm 
im worried about this sort of hysterical tone thats come 
out where people are planning to take trips close schools close 
businesses on december 3 because it is completely ridiculous he 
said 
the us geological survey said the first quake wednesday 
measured 46 on the richter scale the second was believed to be an 
aftershock and measured a preliminary 30 said david stewart 
director of the center for earthquake studies in cape girardeau 
although the quakes were off the new madrid fault proper they 
fell within the fault zone 
each year about 200 measurable quakes occur in the zone 
stewart said but only about three a year pack enough power to be 
felt in fact before wednesday three were felt this year a 28 
quake on jan 9 a 31 on aug 7 and a 34 on aug 29 
said stewart we expect them every now and then when they 
happen they normally mean nothing 
although the quake was relatively minor it was the second 
largest in the new madrid fault zone this century said stewart 
the largest 50 hit in 1976 and was centered near marked tree 
ark 
a quake of magnitude 71 which was mentioned in brownings 
predictions would be about 3000 times more powerful than a quake 
of 46 
did wednesdays shaker make residents more nervous 
of course it does are you kidding said carolyn tinsley 
who owns a video rental store in scott city about 10 miles from 
the quakes epicenter of new hamburg id like to move if i 
could 
in new hamburg a town of about 200 in the missouri bootheel 
students at the kelso c7 elementary school felt the quake 
it sounded like people moving their desks up on the second 
floor said eighthgrader john koepp i wasnt scared 
moments before the temblor teacher donna robert had been asking 
a student whether her mother who experienced a major earthquake in 
alaska might be interested in coming to class to talk about 
earthquakes 
it was like the voice of god speaking i couldnt believe 
it she said 
in dover tenn flossie rouse said it felt like somebody was 
taking the mattress and shaking it dishes and things in my china 
cabinet were rattling like crazy the whole house was shaking 
the new madrid fault runs from marked tree ark across 
southeastern missouri to southern illinois its named for the town 
of new madrid about 40 miles south of new hamburg and 140 miles 
southeast of st louis 
in 181112 a series of quakes estimated up to 8 on the richter 
scale struck the new madrid region causing the mississippi river 
to appear to flow backward and ringing church bells in washington 
dc more than 850 miles away 
browning a climatologist and business consultant in new mexico 
said there was a 5050 chance of an earthquake measuring 70 or 
greater on or about dec 3 browning was unavailable for comment 
wednesday his secretary said 
browning said tidal forces coming to a head on or about dec 3 
could unleash various kinds of geological violence around the 
globe 
earthquake experts have for the most part dismissed his theory 
wiens said experts have found no link between tidal forces and 
earthquakes in fact tidal forces were low wednesday 
but school has been canceled for dec 3 in at least one district 
in arkansas vacations by city employees in carbondale ill have 
been prohibited that week earthquake preparedness seminars have 
been playing to packed crowds 
the mexico city earthquake in 1985 measured 81 last octobers 
earthquake in san francisco measured 71

millions of older women can keep their bones 
strong and help avoid the crippling effects of osteoporosis simply 
by consuming every day the amount of calcium contained in three 
glasses of milk a study today concludes 
osteoporosis the brittle bone disease is one of the most 
common afflictions of growing old it affects an estimated 15 
million to 20 million americans and primarily strikes women after 
menopause when their bodies make less estrogen 
the research found that by bringing up calcium consumption to 
the recommended daily allowance 800 milligrams or the equivalent 
of 24 ounces of milk can completely stop the loss of bone in the 
hips wrist and spine after about age 55 
the people who benefited most substantially were those who had 
a low usual intake of calcium in their diets under 400 milligrams 
a day said dr bess dawsonhughes the studys director 
thats about a serving and a half of calcium rich food the 
depressing thing is that millions of women in the united states in 
this age group have an intake this low 
while older women are often advised to eat plenty of calcium 
some experts have doubted whether it really does prevent 
osteoporosis 
its very important that they showed a calcium effect that 
should be trumpeted commented dr robert recker of creighton 
university 
dawsonhughes and colleagues conducted the study at the us 
department of agriculture human nutrition research center on aging 
at tufts university it was published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
evidence is mounting that calcium matters said 
dawsonhughes here is the first real proof that it makes a 
difference in older women 
according to a national survey the average calcium consumption 
among women over age 44 is 475 milligrams 
dairy products are a primary source of calcium and a quart of 
milk contains 1200 milligrams other sources include dark green 
vegetables such as broccoli bony fish such as sardines calcium 
tablets and foods that are fortified with extra calcium 
women often lose bone rapidly after they go through menopause 
typically around age 50 the latest study found that adding calcuum 
does nothing to prevent this during the first five years after 
menopause but by about age 55 enough calcium in the diet can stop 
the erosion completely 
dr william peck dean of washington university medical school 
said that while the latest finding is important women can still 
benefit from estrogen supplements to preserve their bones 
immediately after menopause 
you dont want a women to think she can walk into the sunset 
eating a lot of calcium he said she wont be protected 
the study was conducted on 301 women with low dietary calcium 
intake doctors tested 500milligram daily doses of two forms of 
calcium calcium carbonate the type usually sold in calcium 
supplements and calcium citrate malate 
calcium citrate malate worked better stopping loss of bone in 
the spine wrist and hip doctors said this form of calcium is 
absorbed more readily although women may be able to achieve the 
same effect by taking larger doses of calcium carbonate 
calcium citrate malate is commercially available only in citrus 
hill plus calcium brand of grapefruit and orange juice procter amp 
gamble which makes the juices cosponsored the latest study with 
the usda according to the company 14 ounces of the juice contains 
400 milligrams of calcium 
dawsonhughes said she would like to see calcium citrate malate 
made available in tablet form however she added my first 
choice for people to get their calcium is to use food sources 
because their general nutritional requirements are more likely to 
be met than by popping pills

secretary of state james a baker iii says 
iraqs threat to execute foreigners hiding in diplomatic embassies 
is repugnant and rejected a demand for the names of people 
given sanctuary in the embassies in baghdad and kuwait 
asked about the threat wednesday baker said weve received a 
note to that effect it falls under the heading of the principle of 
the three rs i think baker continued weve read it its 
repugnant and we reject it 
the note was delivered to the us embassy in baghdad 
in washington however iraqs ambassador mohamed almashat 
denied wednesday night that any such threats have been made by 
iraqi officials 
were not threatening anyone almashat told reporters after 
a meeting a the state department he refused further comment 
later us officials said almashat when asked about the iraqi 
warning note to the embassy claimed to be unaware of its 
existence these officials spoke on condition that they not be 
named 
some 300 to 350 us citizens are stranded in iraq and an 
additional 600 to 700 in kuwait according to figures released 
monday by the state department 
the department released this text of the iraqi note from the 
ministry of foreign affairs 
revolutionary command council resolution no 341 dated 82690 
stipulates that housing a foreigner for the purpose of hiding him 
or her from the authorities is a crime of espionage the punishment 
of death shall be imposed on the individual who commits such a 
crime 
the ministry will appreciate it if the esteemed mission would 
kindly inform the ministry of whether any of its citizens or any 
other nations citizens are residing in the missions embassies and 
your diplomatic residences whether or not these citizens have 
contracts with the government or are working with foreign companies 
operating in iraq 
the united states has refused to discuss whether nondiplomats 
have been given refuge in the embassies 
iraq has been attempting to force foreign embassies in kuwait to 
shut down for more than a month contending there is no need for 
such operations because kuwait is part of iraqi territory 
at the us embassy in kuwait difficult conditions have 
prevailed for the past five weeks because water and electricity 
have been shut off and food supplies are scarce 
during the meeting with almashat the us officials also 
demanded that iraq allow the us embassy in kuwait to function 
normally by restoring water and electricity the sources said 
earlier state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
criticized iraq for refusing to provide the us embassy in baghdad 
with the names of the 93 americans iraqi authorities have detained 
for use as human shields to deter attacks against military 
installations

pizza hut is trying to swallow a big slice of 
moscow bureaucracy battling to keep its two new restaurants open 
after health inspectors shut them a company official says 
restaurant officials say the inspectors are unfamiliar with 
modern technology such as automatic dishwashers or western ways of 
preparing restaurant food and that its just a simple 
misunderstanding 
the pizzerias part of a 10 million joint venture between 
pepsico incs european branch and the moscow city restaurant 
department opened sept 11 and feature americanstyle pizzas 
garlic bread and salad bars for both dollars and rubles 
since they opened soviets have waited in long lines to dine at 
the redandwhite checkered tables amid brass railings and fake 
tropical plants 
on sept 20 however the larger of the two pizza huts on 
kutuzovsky prospekt near a large foreigners compound was shut down 
for 2 days on wednesday the second one on gorky street near the 
kremlin also was closed 
city sanitary inspector t piskaryova told the tass news agency 
that raw semicooked and cooked food was found sidebyside in 
violation of city standards the pizza huts also were found to lack 
large sinks to wash dishes as a backup to their automatic 
dishwashers 
andrew rafalat the britishborn deputy general director of the 
restaurants said wednesday that he was surprised by the closures 
and believes the inspectors are unfamiliar with pizza huts 
techniques 
weve set up joint ventures to transfer new ways of running 
restaurants new technologies new ways of training people and 
clearly what were doing is very different from the soviets he 
said in an interview at the reopened kutuzovsky prospekt restaurant 
as westerntrained waiters scurried by with pans of pizza and trays 
of soft drinks and beer 
now i think that realization is just starting to dawn and 
when they find that our ways of doing things doesnt jell with 
theirs unfortunately the immediate reaction has been to close 
down which is kind of disappointing to us because if theres 
any areas that dont jell lets talk about it rafalat said 
one of the problems has been the lack of a manual dishwashing 
system 
were being told we have to have fivecompartment sinks he 
said well were saying sorry chaps we use dishwashers 
actually in todays world i mean a dishwasher does the job 
better probably but that isnt taken into account in the soviet 
regulations 
rafalat said kitchen plans were submitted to city officials 
months ago and we assumed that those had been looked at 
approved but in reality no one told us that they hadnt 
tass citing fears of salmonella poisoning that occurred in 
moscow a year ago said unwashed vegetables were found next to 
prepared foods in violation of standards 
those are things that once we know about well do to comply 
with the soviet law although we dont do it that way in any other 
country rafalat said we have open kitchens because again 
our philosophy is that you have an open planned work area our 
employees are trained in hygiene and they handle it accordingly 
once pizza hut officials were able to explain their operations 
to the inspectors they were allowed to reopen the kutuzovsky 
prospekt restaurant he said 
nothing has changed at all since last thursday were running 
exactly the same restaurant but we now have a clean bill of health 
and we have an agreement to work jointly with the authorities to 
explain our technologies and the way we do things which really 
should have happened a lot earlier he said 
rafalat could not say when the gorky street restaurant would 
reopen adding that workers there had to throw out about 220 pounds 
of dough wednesday its a pretty substantial amount of food in a 
city which i dont think should be wasting food he said 
the larger restaurant has been serving around 2000 customers a 
day and many want two or three pizzas forcing officials to 
restrict the number of pies a person can take out he said 
rafalat said his objective was to find a common language 
with city officials because thats the future of this country 
here if they dont find a common language then theres not going 
to be many more businesses opening up 
soviet bureaucracy is renowned for its ability to try and 
strangle businesses he said 
but he noted pepsico has 16 years of dealing with the soviet 
bureaucracy long enough to know that its a factor of business 
life here and were going to keep punching our way through

an economist delving into why americans pay more 
than canadians for health care has discovered one important reason 
us doctors charge twice as much for doing less 
despite their bigger fees us doctors earn only about 
onethird more than their canadian counterparts said the study 
this is largely because they see fewer patients and have higher 
overhead for such things as fancier offices 
health care for americans costs an average of 1780 per year 
while for canadians it costs 1286 according to the study by 
economist victor r fuchs of stanford university 
overall physician fees are 24 times higher in the united 
states he said differences in hospital bills and other expenses 
also contribute to the lower cost of medical care in canada 
however canadian doctors do not save money by skimping on 
patient care fuchs said in fact he found that they provide about 
25 percent more services to their patients 
canada provides complete fully paid health coverage for all 
citizens in the united states one in seven people has no health 
insurance and even those with coverage typically have to pay at 
least part of the bill 
if physician fees in the united states were the same as in 
canada by how much would total health care expenditures be 
reduced said fuchs if the fees were cut in half and lowered 
to the canadian level total expenditures would be reduced by about 
10 percent 
his calculations which converted canadian figures into us 
dollars were based was based on 1985 data and published in todays 
issue of the new england journal of medicine 
among the findings 
us fees for surgery and other hightech services such as 
xrays and anesthesia were more than three times higher 
on a per capita basis canada had more doctors but fewer 
specialists 
in 1985 net income for officebased doctors was 112199 in 
the united states and 73607 in canada 
us doctors are paid five times more than canadians for 
visiting patients in the hospital 
canadian fees are uniform for each service within provinces and 
are set through negotiations between doctors and the government 
fuchs said he doubts the canadian system could be adopted in the 
united states 
there is reason to question whether the quality of our civil 
services is up to the quality of the canadian civil services he 
said there is also reason to question whether the organization 
and degree of discipline in the profession is as strong as in 
canada we are very much individualists and that includes 
physicians

proposals to require food manufacturers to 
disclose the nutrition content of their products should be extended 
to restaurants says a committee of experts 
the institute of medicine panel also said wednesday that 
nutrition labeling should be required for fresh and frozen meat and 
poultry as well as prepared products 
foodlabeling proposals on capitol hill and by the food and drug 
administration already include many of the provisions the panel 
recommended for packaged food seafood and produce 
but neither the pending legislation nor the draft regulations 
addresses meat poultry or restaurants 
the institute is an affiliate of the national academy of 
sciences the congressionally chartered private body established to 
provide scientific advice to government agencies 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the agency planned to consider 
nutritioncontent disclosure for restaurants some time in the 
future but grocery stores are our higher priority 
the fda part of the department of health and human services 
last july proposed regulations that would require nutrition 
labeling for nearly all packaged foods and fresh produce and 
seafood

fbi director william s sessions is defending 
the bureaus undercover tactics including the sting operation 
which videotaped washington mayor marion barry smoking crack 
cocaine 
but sessions acknowledged wednesday that a jurys refusal to 
convict barry of the charge arising from that sting may have 
underscored the need to be very careful and look very carefully 
before you elect to use a particular technique 
sessions also backed the fbis use of undercover operations to 
catch people in the act of other misdeeds as in the abscam 
corruption investigation of a decade ago 
when we gather evidence it is not always simply a matter of 
walking up and asking the farmer if his eggs are fresh sessions 
said 
the videotapes of barry smoking crack were not suppressed 
under the law they were allowed by the court they were available 
to the jury and it did what it wanted to do with it which is the 
genius of our system sessions said 
on other subjects the director said the fbi had no indication 
of iraqisponsored terrorism since iraqs invasion of kuwait last 
month

opponents of a plan to burn 
dioxintainted waste at a closed herbicide plant had five cleanup 
workers arrested for testing an incinerator 
the employees of vertac site contractors a cleanup company 
were arrested wednesday on misdemeanor charges of violating a city 
ordinance regarding incineration police chief frank neely said 
the company has a state contract to dispose of nearly 30000 
barrels of hazardous waste at the plant where herbicides 
including the vietnamera agent orange were made for decades much 
of the waste is contaminated with dioxin a chemical believed to 
cause cancer and a range of other ailments 
the plant last owned by vertac chemical corp is high on the 
federal governments priority superfund list for cleanup of 
hazardous waste sites 
the company on wednesday burned waste not containing dioxin in 
order to determine whether an incinerator can meet standards 
required for disposal of dioxin 
the people opposed to the burn were able to obtain an 
affidavit for arrest for burning solid waste in the city neely 
said 
city ordinances allow the burning of dioxintainted waste only 
all other incineration is illegal authorities said 
the five workers arrested were released on their own 
recognizance he said 
mayor tommy swaim an incinerator supporter criticized 
municipal judge robert batton for acting on the arrest request from 
two opponents who contend that burning the waste is dangerous 
this is a ridiculous arrest totally ridiculous swaim said 
the judge is totally out of line 
laura nelson a spokeswoman for the cleanup company said test 
burning will be halted while we take the matter under legal 
advisement and some decision is made 
michael smith a lawyer for the workers also criticized the 
arrests what theyve done is sworn out warrants against innocent 
people just doing their jobs he said

pierre rinfrets darkhorse 
gubernatorial campaign took another strange turn when he sat out a 
unity meeting with republican leaders demanding to be declared 
the undisputed head of our party 
rinfret who is challenging democratic gov mario cuomo but has 
been fighting with his own party had agreed to attend wednesdays 
meeting of westchester county gop leaders but instead sent a 
spokesman with a resolution he wanted passed immediately 
it urged republicans to endorse his plan to freeze state 
spending cut taxes and reduce state government 
rinfret also demanded that county party leaders recognize 
pierre rinfret as the undisputed head of our party and designate 
his race for governor as being of equal opportunity with any and 
all other races in the state 
state party chairman j patrick barrett said no action was taken 
on rinfrets resolution because the meeting was informal 
we had a lively discussion on how to elect our republican 
state ticket barrett said we strongly reaffirm our support 
for pierre rinfret for governor 
in the four months since desparate gop officials recruited him 
to challenge cuomos bid for a third fourthyear term rinfret has 
garnered attention with proposals like arming and training 100000 
vigilantes to fight crime in new york city and selling the city 
subway system 
rinfret 66 an economist and former unpaid adviser to president 
nixon also invited a tv reporter to his inauguration and 
suggested her husband stay home and the academic creditials in his 
campaign biography have been questioned 
last week rinfret threatened to drop out of the race and lashed 
out at his partys leaders accusing them of hoarding a 325 
million campaign war chest for their own benefit he later dropped 
the threat 
republican state sen roy goodman said wednesdays meeting was 
called to talk about the unity of this party 
as the meeting got under way a rinfret aide handed out copies 
of a letter rinfret sent to barrett and gop county chairmen 
rinfret said events in the last 24 hours have made my attendance 
a political impossibility 
the legislative leaders of the republicancontrolled senate 
have tried to buy me off with a handful of money he wrote 
yesterday i was offered a grand total of 40000 to shut up go 
away and run a dismal campaign for governor 
nassau county gop chairman joseph mondello said he had offered 
rinfret 25000 to help the campaign kavanau wouldnt say who 
offered the additional 15000 
an aide said rinfret was unavailable for comment

a gunman who holed up in a mcdonalds in 
what police assumed was a hostage standoff actually hid his gun in 
a bathroom lay on the floor with 20 others inside and threatened 
no one authorities says 
prosecutors said wednesday they wont press for hostagetaking 
charges against douglas edward girard 32 
there was no crime period inside mcdonalds said sandi 
gibbons spokeswoman for the district attorneys office 
police had assumed the worst monday when a gunman fled into the 
fastfood restaurant moments after a robbery of about 200 at a 
clothing store nearby 
police originally alleged girard held mcdonalds customers and 
employees hostage for nearly seven hours the wait ended early 
tuesday when officers lobbed flashbang grenades inside and 
wrestled girard to the ground 
but on wednesday gary hearnsberger a deputy district attorney 
said it does not appear that from any of the statements that he 
ever threatened anybody or said you cant leave 
he was kind of going along with the program hearnsberger 
said he laid on the floor with the other people 
girard pleaded innocent wednesday to armed robbery and weapons 
charges stemming from the clothing store robbery and a holdup of a 
flower shop sept 8 
police lt ron ingels said that a few people ran from the 
restaurant but most ducked under tables or fled to a basement after 
a cashier noticed the 38caliber revolver in girards waistband 
and shouted a warning 
he didnt wave the gun and order them to stay there ingels 
said i suppose they thought that if they got up and walked out 
something bad could happen 
knowing that girard was inside and armed arriving officers 
assumed they were dealing with a hostage situation ingels said 
we arrive and we dont know what caused them to lay on the 
floor we dont know if the guy ordered them to lay on the floor or 
what ingels said

boston herald in the locker room 
meanwhile the newspaper and national womens groups are 
demanding action against patriots owner victor kiam and the player 
zeke mowatt 
kiam who also owns the company that makes remington shavers 
has been criticized for not condemning mowatt he was also quoted 
in news reports as referring to the herald reporter lisa olson as 
a classic bitch 
nfl commissioner paul tagliabue may decide to suspend fine or 
reprimand mowatt next week after he hears the players side of the 
story league spokesman joe browne said wednesday 
olson has said that several members of the football team 
approached her naked in the locker room sept 17 and made lewd 
suggestions the herald reported five players were involved mowatt 
was said to be among them 
the team said earlier this week that it had fined a player for 
harassing olson the player was not identified and the amount of 
the fine was not disclosed 
meanwhile the herald ran an editorial wednesday asking fans to 
stay away from sundays patriots game and sports editor bob sales 
said he sent a letter to tagliabue calling for kiams suspension 
michele himmelberg president of the association for women in 
sports media said her group would demand that tagliabue make an 
example of kiam to prevent unjust harassment from hindering 
women reporters in their work 
the boston chapter of the national organization for women is 
considering a boycott of remington products 
kiam denied the comment attributed to him saying he called 
olson agressive only he apologized for any mistreatment by his 
employees but olson refused to accept 
how can i accept his apology after he questioned my 
professionalism in front of hundreds of thousands of television 
viewers olson said its obvious the patriots are trying to 
bury the sexual harassment issue by trying to discredit me with 
blatant lies 
she said the patriots should name the players she said verbally 
and sexually harassed her force them to undergo counseling slap 
them with substantial fines and give the proceeds to a shelter for 
battered women 
i was humiliated she said i was put through something so 
vile like that only because i am a woman 
after the incident kiam was quoted as saying the herald had 
been asking for trouble in sending a woman reporter into the 
locker room many newspapers have women sportswriters who regularly 
enter mens locker rooms for interviews

theater owners and filmmakers are giving the 
new movie rating nc17 mixed reviews saying it offers improvements 
over the ruinous x rating but still may prove troublesome 
the motion picture association of america eliminated the x 
rating on wednesday replacing it with nc17 for no children under 
17 admitted 
it said the new label does not immediately carry the commercial 
stigma of x which is so strong that many theater chains 
including the nations two largest wont show xrated films and 
many newspapers wont carry ads for them 
the mpaa also said it will give film companies and theater 
owners more details on films it rates r noting violence sex and 
language the pg13 pg and g ratings will remain the same 
universal pictures xrated henry amp june a historical drama 
featuring some sex scenes will be the first film bearing the nc17 
rating universal said 
its a great step said philip kaufman director of henry 
amp june im just really delighted that we can show this film 
uncut in america and show the film the way i made it it is not 
intended as a prurient film 
critics of the mpaa had been trying for months to change the 
system they said the x rating never copyrighted had become 
synonymous with pornography because makers of hardcore adult films 
used it freely 
the new rating will be copyrighted that means it cannot be used 
by porno producers unless they submit their films for mpaa review 
something they never do because it costs up to 2000 per film 
film critics gene siskel and roger ebert hosts of a syndicated 
moviepreview show applauded the new category 
it represents a victory for everyone who cares about truly 
adult films im using adult here in the sense of mature 
thoughtful serious and intelligent not in the sense of dirty 
movies ebert said 
its good news said dan harkins president of the 
23theater harkins theatres chain in phoenix it takes some of 
the politics out of the rating system and our advertising will be 
strengthened 
it was unclear whether newspapers and tv and radio stations 
would be more inclined to carry ads for movies bearing the nc17 
mark 
laura morgan a spokeswoman for the los angeles times predicted 
advertisements would be judged on a combination of their artwork 
and critics opinions on the movies artistic worth 
bert manzari president of the 28screen seven gables chain in 
seattle said such an evaluation system could become unworkable 
its really going to cause a dilemma for the papers manzari 
said 
william kartozian president of the national organization of 
theater owners agreed that advertising nc17 titles could be 
difficult 
i hope the media will perceive that theres a difference 
between these films and skin flicks said kartozian whose 
organization represents the owners of 13000 theater screens 
kartozian said the initial response to the new rating had been 
positive and he expected most theaters to show nc17 films he 
also said some states may amend the nc17 rating to nc18 barring 
children under 18 
the last time the ratings were changed was in 1984 when the 
pg13 rating was added between the pg and r ratings that change 
was prompted by indiana jones and the temple of doom 
xrated films have included midnight cowboy in 1969 last 
tango in paris in 1973 and a clockwork orange in 1971 
mpaa president jack valenti said the rating system had been 
justifiably criticized its no ones fault but the x rating has 
a patina a complexion which frankly we never intended it to 
have he said 
nc17 was especially welcome at miramax films which had several 
recent releases rated x 
miramax sued the mpaa over its x rating for tie me up tie me 
down the company lost but a new york supreme court judge warned 
that the rating system bordered on censorship 
this just goes to show that being tenacious without waving the 
flag can get the job done said harvey weinstein miramax

an 11week standoff over mohawk tribal lands 
and sovereignty ended in a brawl as warriors lay down their weapons 
and left a detoxification center but resisted when soldiers tried 
to arrest them 
about 400 mohawks who live on a nearby reservation watched 
wednesday nights clash on television grabbed baseball bats lead 
pipes and rocks and attacked troops guarding a bridge that links 
their community with montreal 
a soldier suffered facial injuries in mercier bridge incident 
which ended after soldiers trained rifles on the protesters 
threatening to shoot 
only minor injuries were reported in the earlier brawl at oka 
which began after some of the more than 50 militants who had been 
holed up for a month at the drug and alcohol treatment center tried 
to push past troops 
the warriors at the indian settlement 18 miles west of montreal 
had agreed to end the standoff peacefully but after leaving the 
center many tried to evade soldiers and pass through barbedwire 
barricades 
brawls broke out when soldiers some with fixed bayonets 
seized warriors and women and children accompanying them some 
mohawks had small children in their arms and were knocked to the 
ground witnesses said 
police arrested six mohawks outside army lines on unspecified 
charges and a seventh for obstructing officers three warriors were 
arrested and placed in provincial police custody 
at least 50 mohawks were in army custody late wednesday and some 
could face charges later in connection with a prolonged power 
struggle that amounted to a series of sporadic clashes 
the standoff began july 11 when police tried to storm an indian 
barricade outside oka and a quebec provincial police officer was 
killed blame has not been fixed in the officers death 
the barricade put up by indians opposed to the planned 
extension of a golf course onto what they claim as tribal land was 
dismantled by troops last month thats when the warriors retreated 
to the treatment center 
dozens of indians troops and police have been injured in the 
dispute which has gripped the canadian nation with its questions 
of how far the government should go in guaranteeing native rights 
and sovereignty 
no arrests were reported at the mercier bridge which indians 
had blockaded for most of the summer in support of their oka 
brethren 
maj alain tremblay said it was possible a few of the oka 
warriors had escaped into the woods surrounding the treatment 
center he said a search was planned for sometime today 
at the mercier bridge soldiers were ordered to take aim at the 
angry indians from the kahnawake reservation who were showering 
them with rocks 
it was the first time in the mohawk crisis we had to give 
the order to point weapons said army lt col greg mitchell 
thank god it had the effect of getting the people to withdraw 
the checkpoint was set up to ensure that the bridge a major 
commutation route for people who work in montreal and live on the 
st lawrence rivers southern bank remains open 
after the confrontation ended the mohawks milled about 
watching coverage of the end to the standoff at oka on a portable 
blackandwhite television set jeers erupted when a television 
announcer said the standoff with mohawks had cost the quebec 
government 180 million 
its only a fraction of what they owe us said one mohawk 
man 
the oka confrontation had mobilized the support of native 
communities across the country said an indian spokesman 
there is no question that we have won said francis boots a 
spokesman for the warrior society from the akwesasne reservation 
south of cornwall ontario 
we have acquired an awareness among canadian public we can 
now talk without bureaucrats sweeping issues like land rights under 
the rug he said 
the decision to leave the center near oka was made earlier 
wednesday chief negotiator terry doxtator had said it was made 
because of fear the army would withdraw and be replaced by quebec 
provincial police 
some of the indians were concerned about what treatment they 
would receive by a force that had lost a member in the initial 
clash in july 
us lawyer stanley cohen who walked out of the treatment 
center monday night was released on 3000 bail wednesday 
cohen 40 pleaded innocent tuesday to charges of participating 
in a riot obstructing justice and possession of a firearm in 
manner dangerous to public security he has been advising the 
mohawks since the crisis began

iraq today gave kuwaitis a month to become 
iraqi citizens a new measure aimed at further breaking down 
kuwaits national identity and making the country part of iraq 
a new law published by the interior ministry said citizens of 
kuwait which iraq proclaimed its 19th province after seizing the 
oilrich emirate eight weeks ago have until oct 31 to adopt 
iraqi citizenship 
the ministry did not say what would happen to kuwaitis still in 
the occupied kingdom who do not change their citizenship by the 
deadline 
the law stipulated that only kuwaitis born in kuwait of kuwaiti 
mothers and fathers are eligible for iraqi citizenship 
according to ministry statistics the 1988 census numbered 
socalled pure kuwaitis at 270000 out of a total population of 
about 500000 citizens 
hundreds of thousands of foreigners also live in kuwait they 
include an estimated 300000 palestinians the largest foreign 
community still in kuwait there are also about 120000 indians 
many of whom are trying to leave scores of thousands of asians 
have already fled 
baghdads interior ministry said kuwaitis abroad can get iraqi 
nationality cards from iraqi embassies on condition they return 
their kuwaiti nationality documents 
baghdad also stepped up its verbal attack on the soviet union 
today in response to statements made by soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze at the united nations earlier in the week 
the althawra daily the paper of the ruling arab baath 
socialist party accused the soviets of conducting a policy of 
appeasement towards the united states 
the newspaper said in an editorial that the soviet union 
which has lost its power and influence in the world had 
succumbed to bribery from the west and gulf arab countries to help 
its own troubled economy 
there was a similar attack by the official iraqi news agency on 
wednesday

iraqi officials said today that a note 
asking embassies in baghdad for a list of nondiplomats living in 
their compounds had been misinterpreted as a death threat 
the foreign ministry refused official comment on the note which 
was condemned by us secretary of state james baker on wednesday 
as a threat to hang diplomats harboring foreigners 
however officials did say that the ministry had distributed a 
memo to the embassies informing them that they should submit a list 
of nationals who are not diplomats but who are either in embassies 
diplomatic premises or houses of diplomats 
the memo contained a reminder of an iraqi law issued when iraq 
annexed kuwait last month which stipulated that those who provide 
refuge for foreigners could be punished by death 
the officials said the memo was misinterpreted in that it was 
not a threat against foreign diplomats but was just pointing out 
what the law was as it applied to iraqis 
on wednesday baker said the note falls under the heading of 
the principle of the three rs i think weve read it its 
repugnant and we reject it 
today the french foreign ministry also said its embassy had 
also received the note a spokesman termed it utterly 
intolerable and said france was consulting with friendly 
countries about the matter 
britains foreign office said today that its diplomats had 
received a note but declined to characterize it immediately as 
a death threat 
iraqs ambassador to washington mohamed almashat denied 
wednesday night that any such threats has been made by iraqi 
officials 
were not threatening anyone almashat told reporters after 
a meeting a the state department he refused further comment

a housing firm violated a new law by 
refusing to rent apartments to a drug treatment program a federal 
jury has decided 
the decision wednesday against southern management corp of 
silver spring md was the first court test of a fair housing law 
barring discrimination against handicapped individuals officials 
said 
since the law went into effect in march 1989 the justice 
department has defined handicapped to include recovering 
substance abusers an interpretation upheld by us district judge 
albert v bryan jr 
after a twoday trial before bryan a jury on wednesday ordered 
southern management to pay 36280 in damages to the fairfaxfalls 
church community services board a northern virginia public agency 
that runs a drug rehabilitation program a southern management 
official last year had refused to rent three apartments to 
crossroads telling program officers im not discriminating 
against you i wont rent to any drug program according to 
testimony 
neighborhood opposition has emerged in recent years as one of 
the biggest barriers to expanding drug treatment one of the prime 
goals of the bush administrations antidrug strategy over the 
past year the justice department has attempted to use the 1988 law 
to help break down those barriers officials said 
this is significant to fair housing enforcement its the 
first time a case like this was ever presented to a jury said 
paul hancock chief of housing and civil enforcement of the justice 
departments civil rights division 
a lawyer for southern management said the firm probably will 
appeal the verdict 
crossroads is a longterm rehabilitation program that treats 
about 40 serious drug and alcohol abusers at its residential 
facility said tim harmon a director of the fairfaxfalls church 
services board who oversees the program after graduating from the 
residential facility patients are placed in apartments while they 
work in the community and continue their recovery under 
supervision

prime minister toshiki kaifu unveiled a plan today 
to dispatch japanese military personnel overseas for the first time 
since world war ii but he said they would be unarmed and kept away 
from combat 
the proposal which must be approved by the parliament calls 
for the establishment of the un peace cooperation corps a group 
of military and civilian personnel to participate in un 
peacekeeping activities 
kaifu acknowledged criticism that japan is supplying little more 
than money to the usled force deployed in the middle east in 
response to iraqs invasion of kuwait kaifu flies friday to the 
united states where some of the harshest criticism has been 
voiced 
i myself thought we had to do something requiring a little 
sweat kaifu told a televised news conference 
the japanese proposal is likely to arouse fears among asian 
countries about renewed militarism in japan the asian countries 
suffered from japanese aggression before and during world war ii 
the opposition japan socialist party citing the countrys 
nowar constitution expressed opposition to the plan in a meeting 
with kaifu earlier today cabinet spokesman misoji sakamoto said 
that could mean difficulty in winning approval for the plan in 
parliament because the governing liberal democratic party does not 
have a majority in the upper house the legislation may not be 
voted on until midnovember 
kaifu described the proposal which has yet to be formally 
drafted as part of japans effort to define its role in the 
postcold war era 
under the proposal the corps would be under the prime 
ministers office and would not be allowed to use force activities 
could include communications medical support and transportation of 
goods and personnel sources have said 
kaifu did not give a size for the corps although sources have 
said it could include 1000 to 2000 people 
although there has been debate within the government about 
whether the corps members could carry pistols kaifu said they 
would be unarmed 
i know there are many opinions about their role but my 
position is i dont want them to go to places where they have to 
have weapons he said 
but nobutoshi akao directorgeneral of the united nations 
bureau in the foreign ministry refused to rule out the possibility 
members of the corps would carry sidearms under certain 
circumstances 
masashi nishihara a professor of international relations at the 
national defense academy said im not sure its going to be a 
big contribution to the usled multinational force in the gulf 
kaifu when asked why japan was not willing to play a military 
role responded i agree that japan should do more than just make 
comments about the situation but i cannot accept the criticism 
japan is not doing enough just because it is not taking military 
measures 
japans postwar constitution which was written by us 
officials prohibits the use of force to settle international 
disputes 
before kaifus announcement the government pledged 4 billion 
in assistance to the usled multinational force and middle east 
nations having economic troubles because of the international 
embargo on trade with iraq 
japan last month also pledged to send about 100 civilian medical 
personnel to the middle east

the federal deposit insurance corp today 
raised the insurance premium for commercial banks by more than 60 
percent in a move aimed at bolstering its deteriorating insurance 
fund 
starting next year the rate will be 195 cents per 100 of 
deposits up from 12 cents this year it is the maximum increase 
allowed by law 
the action came after the fivemember board heard a financial 
report showing that losses to the fund from bank failures were even 
heavier than anticipated in the first half of this year 
the fund decreased from 132 billion at the end of 1989 to 
114 billion at the end of june a 14 percent drop 
l william seidman fdic chairman said he anticipated losses 
for the year would be closer to 3 billion rather than the 2 
billion he expected only one month earlier 
the 184 billion loss in the first half of the year has reduced 
the level of reserves in the fund to only 60 cents for 100 insured 
deposits the minimum level considered safe is 125 per 100 
the level of reserves is at the lowest point in the funds 
history the congressional general accounting office has warned 
that if the economy dips into a recession the fund could be wiped 
out and require a taxpayer bailout 
on wednesday a senior treasury department official and sen 
donald w riegle chairman of the senate banking committee urged 
enactment of legislation giving the fdic power to raise premiums 
higher and more often 
a measure to do that passed the house last week riegle 
dmich and treasury undersecretary robert r glauber said 
congress must enact one before it adjourns early next month 
meanwhile glauber gave riegles panel an early look at a more 
comprehensive plan to reform the banking system which the 
administration expects to propose for action next year 
it would raise deposit insurance fees for reckless banks and 
limit the number of insured accounts per depositor glauber also 
suggested that the administration may seek to force banks to 
conduct commercial real estate lending through separate affiliates 
that would not use insured deposits 
glauber said the administration favors charging banks making 
risky loans or operating with low capital more for insurance than 
conservatively run banks he said the treasury is closely 
examining proposals that would combine government deposit 
insurance with private insurance to provide guidance for setting 
premium levels 
the administration also favors limiting the number of insured 
accounts per depositor depositors can now insure far more than the 
100000 per account limit by dividing their money among several 
banks or among single joint and trust accounts at a single 
institution 
other proposed changes listed by glauber were 
limiting passthrough insurance for pension funds and other 
large institutional investors under current rules a deposit by a 
pension fund with 100 members would have protection equaling 100 
times the 100000 insurance limit 
forcing regulators to crack down on weak institutions before 
they fail 
requiring annual onsite examinations of large banks and 
ailing banks 
a study by the congressional budget office supported many of 
glaubers points it backed riskbased insurance premiums less 
discretion by regulators over when to close an institution and 
assumption of some portion of deposit insurance by private 
companies the study was presented wednesday to rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking committee 
in another development bankers and regulators from nine other 
countries told us officials at an international conference that 
the united states had gone too far in protecting depositors said 
seidman the fdic chairman 
seidman served as host of the closeddoor conference attended 
by about 80 officials from the united states japan west germany 
britain france canada italy belgium luxembourg and 
switzerland 
at a news briefing seidman said most countries have private 
systems protecting only the smallest depositors although bank 
regulators generally have the flexibility to decide on a 
casebycase basis whether to rescue the largest banks if needed to 
prevent a shock to the banking system 
most attendees believed the united states should follow their 
lead by employing constructive ambiguity as to whether a bank 
will be rescued seidman said

police defused a bomb today planted under a 
lectern that a government minister londons police chief and top 
british and american experts were to use while addressing an 
international conference on terrorism 
commander george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards 
antiterrorist squad said the device contained enough explosives 
to cause death and injury and was probably planted by the irish 
republican army no group claimed responsibility for the bomb 
the plastic lunch box containing the bomb was discovered by 
security guards as delegates arrived for the conference at the 
royal overseas league building on park place near piccadilly in 
central london police and conference organizers said 
the conference was postponed as police searched for a possible 
second device said frank brenchley chairman of the research 
institute for the study of confict and terrorism the institute 
organized the conference 
scheduled speakers at the oneday conference included foreign 
office minister william waldegrave metropolitan police 
commissioner sir peter imbert and professor richard shultz of 
tufts university in boston 
churchillcoleman told a news conference he didnt believe the 
device was aimed at a particular individual 
the target of the device was the conference he said the 
conference which was widely advertised would be seen as a 
legitimate target by irish republican terrorist groups 
the ira has targeted government officials and security forces in 
its fight to end british rule in northern ireland 
churchillcoleman said the lunch box contained a sufficient 
high explosive that had the device exploded which we believe would 
have been around 1030 am it would have caused death and serious 
injury 
he appealed for information on anyone seen in the area and 
warned potential ira targets if you want to live you must 
continue to look and keep on looking 
joan bates spokeswoman for the research institute for the study 
of confict and terrorism said the package had been found 
underneath the lectern where speakers would have been 
all other buildings on park place were also evacuated and the 
streets sealed off by police 
professor paul wilkinson of the university of st andrews in 
scotland who is the institutes director and a leading british 
expert on antiterrorism said extremely thorough security 
arrangements had been made for the conference 
an incident like this does remind you of the need for 
alertness at all times and the professionalism and courage of those 
whose daily duty it is to deal with emergencies of this sort he 
said 
when you are studying a subject you recognize there is a 
constant problem and a large number of groups use this sort of 
weapon that is why it is important to study it and ways of 
combating the threat more effectively

in vaticansoviet relations under the new law the church can 
apply to local authorities to regain lawful status

former president ahmed ben bella 
returned home today after a decade in exile and urged tens of 
thousands of cheering supporters to volunteer to fight in support 
of iraq 
he also called on algerias government to resign 
many people in a throng that greeted his ferry after an 
overnight voyage from spain waved posters of iraqi president saddam 
hussein along with portraits of ben bella leader of the algerian 
war for independence against france 
iraq needs support said ben bella 73 a fiery hourlong 
speech after coming ashore telephone the iraqis send telegrams 
and tell them you are with them go by the hundreds of thousands to 
the iraqi embassy and dont leave until they sign you up as 
volunteers 
he urged supporters to stage a protest at the us embassy 
denouncing the american military deployment in the persian gulf 
more than 100000 people massed along a seaside boulevard 
chanting ben bellas name as the car ferry hoggar arrived from 
barcelona other boats in the harbor blared horns and sirens in 
welcome 
ben bella said he hoped to weld a new political coalition that 
would defeat the longruling national liberation front to which 
he once belonged legislative elections are scheduled for early 
next year but ben bella said the government should resign 
immediately 
im nervous to come back but im very moved he said as the 
boat docked we have huge problems in algeria and i hope i can 
do something to restore our dreams 
he embraced his wife and children who made the voyage with him 
supporters on the ferry tossed posters and books over the railing 
to people gathered on the dock 
bodyguards then escorted ben bella to shore his first time back 
in algeria since he voluntarily went into exile in europe in 1981 
he became algerias first president in 1962 after the eightyear 
independence war against france but was overthrown in a military 
coup in 1965 and imprisoned until shortly before he went into 
exile 
in his speech delivered from a platform erected outside the 
national assembly building ben bella described the international 
mobilization against iraq as a zionist plot supported by the 
united states 
if they strike saddam that means they strike at us he 
said we will hit back at everybody 
one of ben bellas former comradesinarms abdelkhadir hadj 
rejoiced as the ferry docked the country is free again said 
hajd 50 i knew one day democracy would triumph 
as the bestknown leader of the war for independence ben bella 
adds a volatile ingredient to algerias experiment with democracy 
he returns home as islamic fundamentalists stand poised to win 
legislative elections in six months with or without them ben 
bella hopes to forge a common front of dozens of disparate 
opposition parties against the ruling party 
ben bella had disappointed partisans by not returning for local 
and regional elections june 12 algerias first multiparty 
balloting since 1962 
he advocated a boycott of those elections claiming they would 
be rigged by the national liberation front 
the fundamentalist islamic salvation front swept a majority of 
local and regional councils in the vote becoming the countrys 
dominant political group 
ben bella has since raised his profile he recently flew to iraq 
for talks with saddam and has appeared on televised news shows in 
algeria and france 
ben bella told saddam that thousands of algerians were ready to 
fight on behalf of iraq a moroccan newspaper reported last week 
despite his erratic threeyear rule ben bella retains an 
immense personal stature among algerians 
admirers say he alone can unite political factions and lift the 
country out of economic misery marked by 25 percent unemployment 
but critics note that he gave algeria the marxist command 
economy secret police and oneparty rule it is only now shaking 
off thanks to political reforms that began after october 1988 
riots

the guardian angels have voted to take their 
volunteer anticrime patrols out of baltimore saying they face 
hostility from police and the mayor refuses to intervene 
the decision comes a week after the conviction of two angels and 
two former members on assault and false imprisonment charges for a 
citizens arrest of a suspected drug dealer that went awry 
founder curtis sliwa said the group will make daily visits to 
mayor kurt schmokes office until monday when the 15 members of 
the baltimore chapter will join chapters elsewhere in maryland 
our only hope is mayor schmoke sliwa said after wednesday 
nights vote 
schmoke who usually doesnt deal directly with the news media 
was in a meeting and unavailable for comment this morning 
his spokesman clint coleman said the mayor opposes the angels 
policy of making citizens arrests he said he did not know if 
schmoke would meet with the angels 
the mayor has always welcomed citizen patrols in our 
community but he has not been supportive of the guardian angels 
tactics of making citizen arrests and thats simply because he 
considers it too dangerous to both the guardian angels and 
citizens coleman said 
most other chapters of the group in 67 cities in the united 
states and canada work successfully with police sliwa said he 
formed the group recognizable by their red berets in new york 
city in 1979 to guard against muggings on the citys subways 
the catalyst for the angels departure was a judges comments 
last week comparing the group to the ku klux klan baltimore 
circuit court judge david mitchell made the remarks when he 
accepted the guilty pleas from the two angels and two oormer 
members 
guardian angels that is a misnomer mitchell said in my 
mind to this judge i see no difference between what this 
organization is and the ku klux klan 
he called the group little boys dressed up like soldiers 
sliwa responded that the judge obviously needs to get 
mugged 
an angel and two former members received sentences of probation 
before judgment meaning they wont have a record if they complete 
three years of supervised probation a second angel who had a 
previous criminal conviction was given a threeyear suspended 
sentence and three years probation 
the convictions stemmed from a july 24 citizens arrest of a man 
who needed 40 stitches to close cuts suffered during the incident 
the angels said the man was sniffing glue but police said they 
found no evidence of that prosecutor barry watson said the man 
was not charged the angels claim police lied

seeking to quell rumors of a military coup soviet 
media gave prominent coverage today to the defense ministers 
assurance that recent troop movements were related to parade plans 
and the potato harvest not a plot 
no army should use arms against its own people marshal 
dmitri yazov told parliament wednesday in a 10minute speech 
his remarks were reported prominently today in the communist 
party daily pravda and the capitals communist youth daily 
moskovsky komsomolets sovietsksya rossiya a russian federation 
party and government paper displayed a picture of paratroopers 
digging potatoes near moscow on its front page 
soviet television today broadcast yazovs remarks in a midday 
newscast 
yazovs comments followed two weeks of reports in liberal 
newspapers and accusations by politicians that the military is 
plotting to overthrow the government which faces growing political 
and economic crises 
such rumors have circulated sporadically throughout president 
mikhail s gorbachevs 5year rule fueled in part by his supposed 
alienation of the military brass because of his moves to cut troops 
and the defense budget and use of soldiers to restore order in 
restive republics 
such theorists hold that the military fed up with soaring 
crime growing shortages and ethnic unrest would ally itself with 
the kgb and orthodox communist party apparatus and move against 
gorbachev 
only recently have newspapers such as komsomolskaya pravda 
literaturnaya gazeta and moscow news freed from strict official 
supervision begun examining the possibility of a military 
overthrow 
the reports have spoken of paratroopers dressed in combat gear 
bulletproof vests and helmets arriving at a military airfield near 
moscow some have even reported that the military leadership 
already has a concrete plan to take control regionbyregion 
embroiled in confusion protest and economic hard times the 
soviet public has leaned toward believing the rumors even though 
the soviet union has never had a military coup 
the latest publication prompting yazovs appearance before the 
supreme soviet was in komsomolskaya pravda a youth newspaper on 
wednesday 
it spoke of alleged military plans to move against democratic 
forces plotting to take over strategic points such as power 
stations television offices and railway terminals troops from 
ryazan and tula were reportedly put in a state of combat readiness 
the article ended by asking readers who by design out of 
fear or guided by dangerous political ambitions issued the order 
to take measures the sooner we find an answer the safer we 
shall feel 
yazov speaking to the supreme soviet confirmed there were 
troop movements in moscow in recent weeks but said they were 
related either to soldiers participation in the traditional nov 7 
revolution day parade or their help in gathering this years record 
harvest he said it was normal for certain types of troops to 
travel with ammunition and in military vehicles and denied soldiers 
were put in a state of military readiness 
all facts spelled out in this article are made up declared 
yazov wearing his drab green uniform emblazoned with a dozen rows 
of medals 
i again report fully and officially that our paratroopers and 
other troops received no missions 
he then quoted from a statement by some legislators expressing 
concern about the reported troop movements 
no army should use arms against its own people i agree with 
this he said at the same time however yazov did not take the 
opportunity to reiterate his support for gorbachev who was not 
present for the speech 
supreme soviet chairman anatoly lukyanov spoke for the political 
leadership 
passions are now being fanned deliberately said lukyanov 
who holds powers similar to those of a vice president the 
passions are connected with some kind of plots and so forth 
the tense mood prevailed as well at a wednesday evening meeting 
of radical lawmakers from the national and russian federation 
parliaments several speakers mentioned their fears of a military 
coup 
moscow mayor gavriil popov was critical of the supreme soviet 
for granting gorbachev extraordinary powers and for being unable to 
choose among competing economic plans

britain today joined the united states in 
rejecting an iraqi threat to execute diplomats giving sanctuary to 
westerners in baghdad 
iraqs threat makes it impossible to take seriously any 
pretensions on its part to be a civilized state the foreign 
office said in a statement 
secretary of state james a baker iii first disclosed the threat 
wednesday saying it was contained in an official statement iraq 
delivered earlier in the day to the us embassy in baghdad 
a british foreign office spokesman said today that british and 
other western european diplomats in baghdad received the 
threatening note late wednesday from the iraqi foreign ministry 
france also said its embassy in baghdad received the note today 
and a foreign ministry spokesman in paris called the threat 
utterly intolerable he said france would consult with other 
countries facing the same threat 
the note said that giving sanctuary to a foreigner was 
espionage and iraq would execute anyone commiting such a crime 
the iraqi foreign ministry refused to elaborate on the message 
today but iraqi officials said it was referring to iraqis 
harboring westerners not to diplomats giving westerners refuge 
the iraqi officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the memo only contained a reminder of an iraqi law issued when 
iraq annexed kuwait last month which stipulated that those who 
provide refuge for foreigners could be punished by death the 
officials said the law applies only to iraqis 
on wednesday baker called the iraqi threat repugnant and 
rejected a demand for the names of people given sanctuary in the 
us embassies in baghdad and kuwait 
the foreign office spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said britain regarded the note as a threat to kill its 
diplomats we have no option but to regard this as such a 
threat said the spokesman 
he said some 50 britons were being given refuge in the british 
embassy in baghdad the embassy also contains 11 diplomats and 11 
support staff 
the spokesman said britain also would refuse to give iraq a list 
of the people who have found refuge in the embassy 
the foreign office said it had received no subsequent indication 
from the iraqi authorities that the note was not intended as a 
death threat

a blaze at an oil refinery sent 
sheets of flame into the sky forcing plant workers to evacuate and 
officials to shut down a nearby highway for nearly three hours 
early today 
no injuries were reported in the fire that erupted wednesday 
night at the san joaquin refining co said carl nicita a 
dispatcher for the kern county fire department 
ten workers were evacuated after the fire erupted in a refinery 
tower at 1115 pm nicita said some 100 firefighters 
extinguished the blaze by 230 am 
the fires cause was under investigation although a leaky pump 
that feeds oil from ground tanks to the 70foot tower may have 
contributed to the blaze nicita said there was no immediate 
damage estimate 
state route 99 which runs adjacent to the refinery was closed 
until just after 2 am as a precaution said california highway 
patrol dispatcher lolly craig 
dave hacker of radio station kbak said the flames could be 
seen from several miles away prompting telephone calls from

bombs exploded early today at two 
us pharmaceutical firms and another device was defused at a 
local branch of a us bank in the sixth attack on an american firm 
within 24 hours police said 
there was no claim of responsibility and no injuries in the 
predawn blasts which followed explosions and attempted bombings 
argeting american japanese and hong kong business interests 
police believe the attacks have been carried out by military 
extremists seeking to topple president corazon aquino by 
frightening away foreign investors and embarrassing the government 
abroad 
in a separate development in angeles 50 miles north of manila 
unidentified men burned tires and threw homemade bombs before dawn 
today along a highway about two miles from the usrun clark air 
base police said there were no injuries during the protest which 
was apparently against the governments decision last week to raise 
oil prices 
us ambassador nicholas platt said he discussed the manila 
attacks today with defense secretary fidel ramos and urged american 
firms to hang in there and be careful 
share prices plunged today to a 3year low on the manila stock 
exchange because of investor fears of more instability 
in the first incident today police defused a small bomb after 
witnesses saw two men hurl a packet into the compound of the boston 
bank of the philippines in suburban kalookan 
police said the bomb contained 10 sticks of dynamite and c4 
plastic explosives which are issued to the armed forces and not 
generally available from commercial sources 
about a half hour later two joggers threw a bomb at the 
headquarters of the squibb drug firm in suburban makati the bomb 
exploded inside the compound but caused only minor damage police 
said 
minutes later witnesses said two joggers also threw a device at 
the headquarters of another american pharmaceutical firm wyeth 
suaco laboratories it also caused little damage 
police said the two bombs at the drug firm also contained 
dynamite and c4 
obviously the exercise is to frighten foreign investors 
away said aurelio periquet president of the philippine chamber 
of commerce and industry the purpose is to destabilize the 
political situation here 
the latest bombings brought to 31 the number of blasts in the 
capital since aug 13 manilas police commander brig gen marino 
filart said it appeared most of the bombings were carried out by 
rightwing extremists 
late wednesday a small bomb hurled from a passing car exploded 
at the colgatepalmolive plant in makati shattering windows but 
causing no injuries 
earlier wednesday small bombs also exploded at the cocacola 
and pepsi bottling plants and another device was defused at a 
factory operated by the american electronics and communications 
firm motorola 
another bomb was discovered and defused in front of a japanese 
computer chip plant in the taguig district 
on sunday bombs exploded at the mandarin oriental a hong kong 
hotel chain and the nikko manila garden a japaneserun hotel 
eight people four japanese and four filipinos were slightly 
injured in the nikko garden blast

a blaze that destroyed an unfinished subway 
tunnel and shut down a major highway last summer probably was 
caused by a cutting torch officials say 
the july 13 fire in the downtown metro rail tunnel caused no 
injuries or deaths but produced more than 2 million damage the 
750foot tunnel which passes under us 101 partially collapsed 
the freeway was closed for days until it could be shored up 
the report by the socalled independent investigation team was 
commissioned by rail construction corp a subsidiary of the los 
angeles county transportation commission 
the investigation did not rule out arson but said the fire most 
likely began with the use of a torchtto trim steel spikes in the 
tunnel 
the tunnel was shored up with timber a polyethylene membrane 
was installed over the timber to keep methane gas in the soil from 
entering the tunnel 
the report said the torch flame or hot metal slag probably 
caused a timber to smolder seven or eight hours later the fire 
burned through the membrane and spread rapidly through the two 
materials 
the report said two earlier fires in the same 24hour period had 
been quickly extinguished 
the fire department hasnt completed its investigation and the 
district attorney is investigating whether safety violations were a 
factor 
ed mcspedon rail constructions president and chief executive 
officer said wednesday the firm has implemented a fire safety plan 
that includes a constant fire watch at construction sites 
in the future precast concrete liners will be used instead of 
the timber and polyethylene combination mcspedon said 
the first 44mile segment of the 33 billion subway is 
scheduled to open in 1994 it is 135 million over budget and 18 
months behind schedule metro rail will eventually stretch 17 miles 
from downtown to the san fernando valley

president bush resumed his attack on 
congressional democrats today saying they had delayed a budget 
deal that would avoid deep spending cuts congressional leaders 
however expressed optimism that a compromise may be near 
there may be senior citizens wondering why their social 
security checks are late bush said referring to one effect of 
federal cuts that will otherwise be triggered monday we cant 
afford business as usual the american people deserve better 
while bush spoke at a campaign breakfast for republicans in 
minneapolis leading lawmakers said progress was being made in the 
4monthold budget negotiations 
were a little bit in the precincts of reaching a conclusion 
rather than at the wrapup stage said house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash a good deal has been agreed to tentatively 
theyre basically there outside of capital gains said rep 
silvio conte rmass get rid of that darned thing were home 
free 
bush has tempered his demand for a lower capital gains tax rate 
which has been the major obstacle to a budget pact 
should no action be taken by monday the start of the 1991 
fiscal year government spending will be slashed by 85 billion and 
many of its 24 million civilian workers will face payless days off 
as the grammrudman deficitreduction law takes effect 
wednesdays bargaining session capped a day in which 
participants said bush was moving toward defusing the prickliest 
issue remaining between the two sides whether tax rates on capital 
gains should be dropped 
but the president and democratic congressional leaders also 
traded accusations that the other side was jeopardizing the 
negotiations 
if and when the ax falls the democratic congress knows that 
it will be held accountable bush told a republican campaign 
rally in akron ohio 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine fired back saying the remarks 
could damage the talks 
ironically i thought we were making progress mitchell 
said 
bargainers also reported progress at recent sessions in 
narrowing differences between the two sides over defense cuts and 
reductions in domestic programs the overall goal is to take a 500 
billion bite out of the federal deficit over five years 
since talks began in may bush has sought to honor a campaign 
pledge and lower the rates of the capital gains tax which is 
charged on profits from the sale of real estate and other 
investments 
democrats say the proposal which bush contends would spur the 
economy would merely put money in the pockets of wealthy property 
owners they have demanded tax hikes for the rich as a tradeoff 
administration bargainers offered to leave the capital gains tax 
rate at current levels in exchange for exempting the increased 
value of assets due to inflation said officials who asked not to 
be identified 
i think its still a very viable option said one republican 
official 
democrats brushed aside the idea one official said but there 
were other signs of a new white house flexibility on the issue 
republican lawmakers who met with bush at the white house early 
wednesday said that rather on insisting on a capital gains tax cut 
the president was demanding a package with items intended to spur 
economic growth these might include tax breaks for companies that 
conduct research or do business in deteriorating cities or rural 
areas the republicans said 
a number of options have come up foley said during a break 
in the closeddoor budget talks but whether they can be called a 
true alternative to a capital gains tax cut is debatable 
the two top republicans in congress michel and senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan have already said a reduction in the 
capital gains tax rate should not be an absolute demand at the 
negotiations 
bargainers racing to hammer out a deal faced a dwindling number 
of days in which to act with congress planning to recess from 
friday afternoon through saturday for the jewish holiday of yom 
kippur a fullfledged sunday session seemed likely 
the house was ready to vote on a bill temporarily financing the 
government beyond sunday when its authority to spend money 
expires 
the measure contained language delaying the spending cuts 
administration officials said that unless a budget deal was 
reached they would oppose a postponement of the reductions as a 
way of pressuring the bargainers 
domestic programs would be slashed by 324 percent and defense 
programs by 353 percent if the grammrudman spending cuts take 
effect monday 
social security the military payroll and many benefits for 
veterans and lowincome people are exempt from the cuts

president bush concerned about price 
speculation has ordered the sale of 5 million barrels of oil from 
the strategic petroleum reserve to fight escalating prices the 
administration said today the oil would be available on the market 
in about two weeks 
bush said wednesday he was prepared to take additional steps if 
intensive and unwarranted speculation continues 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated the move was as 
much to warn off price escalation as to test the reserve system 
but energy secretary james watkins told the house energy and 
commerce committee today the sale is just a test set in the law by 
congress earlier this month 
this is not an emergency drawdown of the reserve watkins 
said but it will clearly be an important factor should it 
become necessary in the future to conduct an emergency strategic 
stock drawdown in coordination with our allies 
bob porter an energy department spokesman said the department 
expects to put the oil on sale between oct 12 and 15 
under the sale about 167000 barrels of oil far short of the 
500000 barrels analysts say would be needed to drive prices down 
significantly will be released daily for 30 days porter said 
at a fundraising breakfast this morning for minnesota 
republican gubernatorial candidate jon grunseth bush praised the 
commitment of us servicemen and women to contain aggression 
he also said the most meaningful and most hopeful sign for 
change in the world is the cooperative effort demonstrated by the 
united states and the soviet union in opposing iraqs aggression 
the petroleum reserve now containing 590 million barrels was 
established in 1975 to ward against potential future oil shortages 
the president said he wanted to test the process of drawing down 
the reserve he said the country has sufficient oil to meet 
current needs and added that there is no justification for the 
intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures 
oil prices have skyrocketed to nearly 40 a barrel since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 and the united nations imposed a trade 
embargo against baghdad 
bushs decision marks the first time the government has tapped 
into the reserve it comes at a time when the administration says 
there is not an oil shortage but as officials are warning the 
middle east crisis could result in tight supplies by the end of the 
year 
weve been suggesting this to him said rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee but 
he said the administration needs to call on west germany and japan 
to also tap their stockpiles 
administration oficials do not use the word gouging but claim 
that the price escalation is unwarranted 
bush said wednesday at home and abroad let me caution those 
who might take advantage of the current crisis in the persian gulf 
those who might seek profit by subverting the sanctions or here at 
home those speculators who might try to drive up the price of 
oil 
oil supplies were reduced by the international embargo against 
kuwait and iraq following iraqs invasion of its neighbor but 
industry experts estimate production in other countries has 
restored about twothirds of the 48 million daily barrels of oil 
production removed from world markets by the embargo 
the united states uses more than 17 million barrels a day about 
half of it imported 
with winter heating needs approaching we do anticipate that 
there could be shortages and that we could have a need to rely on 
the petroleum reserve in a more permanent fashion fitzwater 
said

a federal judge says he is going to resign from 
the bench mainly because hes unhappy with sentencing guidelines 
enacted by congress 
us district judge j lawrence irving said wednesday he plans 
to notify president bush that he will resign effective dec 31 
irving 55 a 1982 reagan appointee said the strict guidelines 
which sharply reduce a judges discretion in sentencing convicted 
criminals have taken much of the enjoyment out of being a federal 
judge 
to me the job just isnt as much fun as it used to be he 
said the purpose of the guidelines is admirable to do away 
with disparity in sentencing it just doesnt work out that way 
in a march 1988 case irving declared the sentencing guidelines 
unconstitutional joining three other federal judges in san diego 
who had issued similar rulings they were among the first in the 
nation to challenge the standards which were upheld by the us 
supreme court in january 1989 
irving said he believes hes the first judge in the nation to 
quit because of the rules 
federal judges appointed by the president and approved by the 
senate have life tenure they earn about 96000 a year and that 
will rise to 120653 in february 
the sentencing reform act of 1984 established a sentencing 
commission that set the new guidelines which took effect in 
november 1987 
the guidelines use a point system based mainly on the severity 
of the crime to determine sentences a persons background role in 
the crime past record or remorse cannot be used to reduce the 
sentence below the minimum guideline 
it used to be that a judge could do some good in sentencing 
by being lenient when leniency was called for he said now i 
cant do that 
ill tell you it really tugs at your heart when you have to 
sentence a firsttime offender to a 10year minimummandatory 
sentence or a 15year minimummandatory with no parole

mayor marion barry met today with protest 
leaders at the university of the district of columbia where 
students were occupying two buildings and demanding the resignation 
of most of the schools trustees 
mark thompson a protest leader at the 12000student public 
university said the demonstration was prompted by our disgust 
with the board of trustees 
this school is in a situation of disarray thompson said 
our accreditation is in jeopardy and that is a direct result of 
the board of trustees 
he also said months of attempts to resolve some of their 
grievances through negotiation had failed 
thompson said the students would remain in the buildings until a 
list of demands were met by the administration including one that 
barry dismiss 11 of the schools 15 trustees 
a university spokesman john britton announced that the 
university would be closed for the day 
were asking students to boycott classes thompson said 
students should not come to any classes until all our demands 
were met 
members of the student government and others took control of a 
building that houses the university radio station bookstore and 
several offices and classrooms late wednesday after blocking 
entrances earlier 
about 200 students subsequently shoved their way past four 
security guards standing in a doorway to take control of the main 
administration building 
the students met briefly with udc interim president miles fisher 
iv outside his office after forcing their way into the building 
they agreed to leave a thirdfloor area housing offices of the 
schools top administrators after fisher agreed to surrender the 
rest of the building to them 
udc trustees who attended an emergency meeting off campus sent 
two of their members to the school to discuss the terms and 
conditions of a meeting but they were rebuffed by students 
students entered and left the occupied buildings freely taking 
in pillows and blankets and market baskets filled with groceries 
and taking out bags of garbage 
part of the protest involved the universitys plans to spend 
16 million to renovate a library so that a controversial artwork 
the dinner party can be installed there 
the house of representatives voted to cut that same amount from 
udcs operating budget after some lawmakers described the artwork 
as obscene 
the work is a large ceramic sculpture that depicts the history 
of women in 39 place settings some of which contain images of 
female genitalia 
the students also complained about the turnover rate for faculty 
and administrators and the schools athletic program

a county judge said he would take over 
questioning of potential jurors today if lawyers in the nations 
first obscenity trial of a museum and its director failed to make a 
more serious effort to seat a jury 
im going to have to do something to move this along 
hamilton county judge david albanese said 
he had said wednesday that the court would remain in session as 
long as necessary today to get a jury seated 
the contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie 
face misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and displaying nude 
photos of children in an exhibit of photographer robert 
mapplethorpe a homosexual who died of aids last year 
by wednesday lawyers had rejected eight prospective jurors and 
tentatively seated seven 
albanese warned attorneys to limit their questions to those that 
would determine whether a juror could be fair and impartial 
theyre not going to be educated in the law or indoctrinated 
into cases of the state or defense the judge said 
while defense lawyers had sought to expose bias toward 
homosexuals potential jurors must distinguish between art and 
obscenity in weighing the charges over seven of the 175 photos from 
the exhibit 
one photo shows a man urinating into another mans mouth others 
show anal penetration with objects and other homosexual or 
sadomasochistic images 
on wednesday the defense persuaded the judge to remove two 
prospective jurors who admitted they were prejudiced against 
homosexuals 
marc mezibov the gallerys lawyer asked one potential juror 
was that a strike against the contemporary arts center to know it 
was exhibiting works of a homosexual 
she replied that it was not 
each side is allowed six peremptory removals for which the 
lawyers need not give a reason and an unlimited number of 
challenges for cause in which they must convince a judge that the 
juror is biased 
prosecutors have used three peremptory challenges to remove a 
man and a woman who saw the exhibit and a man who said adults do 
not need the protection of obscenity laws 
if convicted of both charges barrie 43 could be sentenced to 
a year in jail and fined 2000 the gallery could be fined 
10000 
the exhibit now concluding a national tour in boston drew more 
than 80000 viewers during its sevenweek cincinnati exhibition 
ending in may 
lawyers also have tried to determine potential jurors opinions 
about pornography the role of an art museum and the types of 
photographs that should be allowed to be exhibited 
barries attorney h louis sirkin asked one woman if she had 
stayed away from the exhibit because of its content 
no she said it rained the day i was going to go 
defense attorneys rejected two potential jurors who indicated 
they were unfamiliar with the communitys social standards and one 
woman who said she would give gods law priority over mans 
law in deciding if the photos are obscene 
under a us supreme court ruling material alleged to be 
obscene must be judged according to the communitys standards

the widow of a kentucky coal miner said today 
federal inspectors are partly to blame for a methane explosion that 
killed 10 miners because of their lax inspection policy 
sharon scott 36 said the mine safety and health administration 
knew prior to the september 1989 blast near wheatcroft ky that 
water had backed up in the mine jeopardizing ventilation 
msha inspectors routinely failed to order remedial measures 
for safety violations that they did see mrs scott told the 
house education and labor committees health and safety 
subcommittee 
william j tattersall assistant labor secretary for mine safety 
and health acknowledged there were shortcomings in mshas 
enforcement of regulations at the pyro mining co mine where the 
blast occurred 
but he said those shortcomings did not cause the explosion 
tattersall said enforcement had been stepped up at the mine but 
the sanctions imposed by inspectors were not strong enough to 
change pyros poor attitude about safety poor safety management 
and disregard of the law 
james greenlee executive vice president of costain coal inc 
based in evansville ind and owner of pyro mining declined to 
comment at length on the hearing obviously we would not agree 
with mr tattersalls analysis of our performance he said 
the federal government has proposed fines of more than 500000 
against pyro for 121 alleged violations of federal safety laws 
some of them which allegedly were directly linked to the explosion 
mrs scott who is a coal miner was working in a different part 
of the mine when the blast occurred and she escaped she fought 
back sobs as she told the committee about the events leading up to 
the explosion that killed her husband curtis and nine others 
she said that pyro managers frequently made miners hide safety 
violations from federal inspectors on one occasion mrs scott 
said she was ordered to stick blasting caps inside her blouse so 
that the inspectors would not discover that blasting had been done 
i do not believe that msha should be held responsible for 
facts that were hidden from them by mine management mrs scott 
said but she added that federal inspectors simply overlooked many 
dangerous violations 
i believe this lax inspection policy and carefree attitude 
about ordering management to correct dangers makes msha partially 
responsible for the deaths of my husband and friends she said

a transsexual lost her sixyear battle 
for the right to marry a man when the european court of human 
rights on thursday endorsed a british law barring the marriage 
caroline cossey 36 who works as a model and who has campaigned 
to be treated officially as a woman sought the right to have her 
birth certificate changed to show she is now female 
she underwent a sex change operation in 1974 but is forbidden 
by law to marry in britain because her birth certificate says she 
was born a male 
the strasbourg court following its decision in a similar 
transsexual case two years ago ruled on a 144 vote that british 
policy is fair and that cosseys human rights had not been 
violated 
the court also rejected her claim that she was being denied the 
fundamental right to marry contained in the european convention on 
human rights 
the court affirmed its support for the traditional concept of 
marriage it noted that there was no legal obstacle preventing 
cossey from marrying a woman 
born with the name barry kenneth she adopted the name caroline 
at the age of 18 she initiated the legal challange with the 
strasbourg court in 1984

parliament it was an act of defiance hardly imaginable in most of 
the persian gulf ruled by a collection of dictators hereditary 
monarchs and fundamentalist leaders 
but kuwaits 64yearold emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
was different a contradictory jumble of benevolent father 
autocrat and parlor liberal the emir has tolerated other voices 
shrewdly the alsabah family has shared kuwaits vast wealth 
with their countrymen ensuring a measure of loyalty 
even at the height of prodemocracy demonstrations last winter 
no one was calling for the alsabahs ouster they were asking for 
more power sharing 
president bush has invited alsabah here friday to show iraq 
that the united states still views the emir as the legitimate ruler 
of kuwait us insistence that alsabah be restored to power is 
second only to its demand that iraq withdraw from kuwait 
some lawmakers criticize the us stance toward the autocratic 
government 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house mideast affairs 
subcommittee has said that unconditional support for alsabah 
would put us in conflict with the worldwide trend toward 
democracy as well as with out own democratic values 
but unlike latin america and other parts of the world where the 
united states has made demands for democracy a pillar of its 
foreign policy stability is the main us goal in the oilrich 
persian gulf 
secretary of state james a baker iii said this is not the time 
to insist on reforms 
the one thing we have to be careful about is getting into the 
position of saying that because a particular former government 
was not a form of government that we prefer therefore we somehow 
change that or participate in changing that form of government 
he said that would be nothing more than rewarding saddam 
husseins aggression 
since assuming leadership in 1977 alsabah walked a precarious 
line between progressive forces at home who wanted democracy and 
repressive forces next door in saudi arabia who feared democracy 
might spread and endanger their conservative theocratic rule 
but unlike the saudi king alsabah allowed a lively media 
albeit one periodically reined in with censorship unlike saudi 
laws kuwaits allowed women to drive and vote 
there was nothing clandestine about the kuwaiti opposition 
which enjoyed wide support among the countrys merchants and 
leading families 
they discussed argued talked back to the emir said judith 
kipper a mideast expert at the brookings institution 
the alsabah clan which has ruled kuwait for more than 200 
years experimented with parliamentary elections several times 
since gaining independence from britain in 1961 but each time the 
legislature was decreed shut when lawmakers became too critical of 
the government or of other regional leaders 
last june the emir tried again this time he named one third 
of the 75 deputies and the rest were elected the professors were 
among several groups to voice outrage at the emirs decree which 
they said violated the constitution 
kuwaitis have one of the highest per capita incomes in the 
world about 20000 a year and the alsabah clan is greatly 
admired for its shrewd investment of the oil wealth 
the family business some 1000 alsabah princes fill key 
government and financial posts brought in more from investments 
last year than from oil revenue 
the clans legitimacy derives in large measure from its 
longevity it ruled uninterrupted from 1751 through british 
control from 1899 to 1961 and until it was forced to flee ahead of 
invading iraqi troops aug 2 most got away to saudi arabia 
the emirs young brother was killed defending the family palace 
it was a measure of alsabahs acceptance that when iraq tried 
to install a provisional government of kuwaiti dissidents not one 
serious participant was found 
but the alsabah benevolence did not extend to the expatriates 
who accounted for more than 60 percent of kuwaits 19 million 
people foreigners were excluded from the perks of citizenship such 
as land ownership 
two serious violations of traffic laws for example could 
result in summary deportation for thousands of impoverished asians 
and arabs menial work in kuwait was a livelihood they could ill 
afford to lose 
kuwaitis looked down on other arabs said hooshang 
amirahmadi head of the middle east studies department at rutgers 
university kuwaitis had a special name for the palestinians 
egyptians and other arabs who worked there khadama meaning 
servants he said 
that attitude accounts in part for the bitter resentment of 
kuwait that led some arab governments to gleefully support the 
iraqi invasion 
kuwaitis too were growing dissatisfied with alsabah 
especially after seeing the revolutions that overthrew the 
communist rulers of eastern europe last winter 
if alsabah is reinstated kuwaitis are certain to demand 
change 
kipper predicts upheavals throughout the region 
the invasion she said will be their fall of the berlin 
wall

prime minister brian mulroney received permission 
today from queen elizabeth ii to expand the canadian senate 
mulroney wants the eight additional senators to push through a 
controversial new tax 
the eight have been notified of their appointments and they 
will likely be named today government sources in ottawa said an 
opposition leader called mulroneys unprecedented move 
unbelievable 
mulroney made the request based on an obscure section of the 
1867 constitution as a last resort to save the unpopular goods and 
services tax 
such a request had only been made once before in canadas 
123year history and that appeal was not granted 
the section of the constitution allows the british monarch to 
add four or eight members to the senate on a request by the 
governorgeneral the canadian representative to the commonwealth 
john haslam a spokesman for the queen said in london that 
elizabeth as the constitutional monarch of the former british 
colony was following the provisions of the canadian constitution 
in making the decision 
the measure would expand the senate to 112 seats from 104 and 
establish a slim tory plurality the new senators will be appointed 
by mulroney and therefore be members of his conservative party 
but even with the additional seats the fate of the tax could 
rest on the votes of a handful of independents 
the liberals now hold 52 seats and the tories 46 with one 
reform party representative four independents and one independent 
liberal 
mulroney said he wanted to increase the number of conservative 
senators to push through the tax despite liberal opposition in the 
senate 
liberal party leader jean chretien was incredulous after 
learning of mulroneys latest move particularly in view of the 
prime ministers low standing in recent public opinion polls 
its unbelievable that theyd do that he said at 15 
percent in the polls using the queen 
such a move was tried only once before prime minister alexander 
mackenzie a liberal made such a request in 1873 but the british 
cabinet did not advise the queen to appoint the additional 
senators 
such a move by mulroney could touch off a legal dispute 
british columbia has said it will challenge ottawas ability to 
create the extra senate seats and ontario has said it may join 
that campaign alberta has promised a separate challenge on some 
aspects of the tax itself

king edward viii who abdicated in 1936 to marry 
an american divorcee lied about the size of his fortune pleading 
poverty to secure a royal income before going into exile his first 
official biography said thursday 
author philip ziegler has written king edward viii the 
official biography with the approval of queen elizabeth ii 
edwards niece 
working from the archives of buckingham palace and government 
papers ziegler reveals that edward told a meeting of his family 
and their advisers that his income would hardly be 22500 a year 
and that his total fortune was 405000 
as a result he was guaranteed a yearly income of 94500 on 
condition that he went abroad and would not return without 
government consent he immediately left for france taking the 
title duke of windsor 
ulick alexander keeper of the privy purse later calculated 
that edwards fortune amounted to nearly 5 million excluding real 
estate in canada the sum would be equivalent to 43 million at 
presentday values 
when this was told to king george vi who had succeeded his 
brother on the throne he wrote to edward three months after the 
abdication you were under great strain and i am not seeking to 
reproach you or anyone but the fact remains that i was badly 
misled 
ziegler says the financial arrangements for edwards future did 
more than anything else to poison the atmosphere between him and 
his family their relations remained strained for the rest of his 
life 
in june 1937 six months after abdicating edward married wallis 
warfield simpson of baltimore in a private ceremony at the chateau 
de cande near paris 
mrs simpson had divorced her first two husbands lt winfield 
spencer of the us navy and ernest simpson a usborn british 
citizen who was a stockbroker in london 
edward abdicated because his insistence on marrying a divorcee 
created a constitutional crisis the monarch is temporal head of 
the state church of england which opposes divorce 
the duke was governor of bahamas during world war ii and 
subsequently lived in france where he died at age 77 in 1972 the 
duchess of windsor died in 1986 at age 89 
the duke was always bitter that king george vi did not grant the 
title her royal highness to his wife and ziegler says the 
royal advisers and law officers had grave doubts about the legality 
of depriving the duchess of the title 
but a conviction that the marriage would not last long seemed to 
have been an important factor in the decision the author says 
king george vi told prime minister stanley baldwin 
is she a fit and proper person to become a royal highness 
after what she has done in this country and would the country 
understand it if she became one automatically on marriage i 
my family and queen mary his mother all feel that it would be a 
great mistake to acknowledge mrs simpson as a suitable person to 
become royal the monarchy has been degraded quite enough 
already 
zieglers book published by collins at about 38 is the most 
complete account of the abdication crisis to date 
the 60yearold author is a former publishers editor he has 
written 11 books of history and biography and edited the diaries of 
adm lord louis mountbatten a relative of the royal family and 
last viceroy of india

president bush asked congress today to approve 
a 75 billion package of new arms for saudi arabia including 
missiles tanks and other weapons to beef up the saudi military 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
bushs arms sale proposal included 150 m1a2 tanks 1750 
advanced tow antitank missiles and 6 patriot antimissile 
batteries according to a formal request to congress 
the package also included 200 bradley armored fighting vehicles 
12 apache groundattack helicopters nine multiplelaunch rocket 
systems seven kc130 tanker planes and 10000 trucks transporters 
and trailers 
in another development house members hit snags when they sought 
to move ahead with a resolution backing bushs moves in the persian 
gulf crisis the house foreign affairs committee adjourned without 
action on a proposed resolution of support 
speaking of the saudi arms proposal rep mel levine dcalif 
said this is a significant improvement levine a staunch 
supporter of israel who had objected to an earlier 21 billion 
saudi arms package that also drew objections from israel said 
this is what should have been proposed in the first place 
levine said lawmakers concerned about israels security support 
bushs military moves to counter iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but the earlier larger arms sale proposal appeared to be an 
attempt to use the crisis as justification for sending items not 
needed for the crisis he said 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said the proposed sale 
is urgently needed 
but some supporters of israel said there still was concern about 
offensive weapons included in the new package they said those 
worries could be calmed if the administration comes up with a 
counterbalancing security package for israel 
meanwhile a tentative agreement that had been reached late 
wednesday between the white house and the democraticcontrolled 
foreign affairs committee began to unravel amid democrats fears 
that the document implied congressional consent for future military 
action in the middle east 
some members think theres an implication of the use of 
force later in the crisis said rep lee hamilton dind 
rep william broomfield rmich fumed that it was amazing 
that we can get approval through the united nations for the 
presidents actions but not through the congress i think its 
unfortunate that we cant even get approval when weve got 80 
percent of the american people behind the president 
the administration has decided to divide the saudi arms package 
into two parts one to meet immediate saudi defense needs in the 
current crisis including weapons that can be delivered from 
current stocks or quickly taken off the production line and a 
second 14 billion package to be proposed in january to meet the 
countrys longerterm needs 
the latter package will include f15f fighter planes and more 
tanks said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
delay will give lawmakers more time to deliberate how the sale 
might change the military balance in the volatile region levine 
said 
at the same time the administration has been discussing a new 
package of military aid to israel and senior officials have 
promised to maintain israels qualitative military advantage over 
neighboring states 
in deliberations a day earlier two foreign affairs subcommittees 
sought to make it clear their support for bushs moves so far did 
not imply authorization for future military action 
we have no interest in providing conditional authority to the 
president with regard to future military actions committee 
chairman dante fascell dfla said during a meeting of the middle 
east and arms control subcommittees on wednesday 
we will deal with that judge that as the american people 
will if and when that time arrives fascell said 
action by the full committee would culminate a weeklong 
internal debate between lawmakers who believe congress should take 
a formal part in the gulf situation and those who prefer to keep 
their political distance from it similar talks are under way in 
the senate 
i think its important for congress to act here said 
hamilton chairman of the middle east subcommittee i know some 
of our colleagues would prefer not to take any action but this is 
one of the most significant foreign policy moves in a long 
time i would be uncomfortable if we ignored it 
the resolution condemns the invasion of kuwait and supports 
bushs diplomatic efforts and use of the united nations to bring 
international pressure on iraq to leave kuwait and release 
hostages 
the united states shall to the extent possible use 
diplomatic and other nonmilitary means in order to achieve those 
objectives and policies while maintaining credible united states 
and multinational deterrent military force the resolution says 
fascell said he does not consider the resolution to trigger the 
war powers act which would start the clock running on a 60day 
limit to the us troop deployment he said bush has consulted well 
with congress and met the objectives of the war powers act and a 
confrontation with the white house over the laws technicalities 
would not be useful 
the resolution also calls for continued international efforts to 
contain iraqs military might including proliferation of ballistic 
missiles and weapons of mass destruction and reaffirms the us 
policy of maintaining israels qualitative military edge over its 
neighbors

administration officials expressed outrage 
thursday over a sudanese government request for 150 million in 
food aid at a time when they said its air force is bombing 
humanitarian relief sites including a red cross food barge in 
rebel areas 
sudanese officials submitted their request this week as bush 
administration officials held highlevel meetings to devise ways to 
help that country out of what may become the worst of several food 
crises in recent years 
the problem is so big were really at a loss on how to 
proceed said one official 
the officials said one target of the bombing raids is a food 
barge donated by the norwegian government to the international 
committee for the red cross the barge has been located in the nile 
river adjacent to the southern sudan town of bor a main transit 
point for relief supplies they said 
i think its almost unimaginable that a government facing a 
famine disaster of epic proportions would have the audacity to 
bomb food shipments at the same time they are asking for more food 
assistance said andrew natsios head of the us office of 
foreign disaster assistance 
natsios and other officials said air force bombs have rained 
down on bor and other towns where international relief programs are 
in operation they are run by the world food program the united 
nations childrens fund unicef and the international committee 
for the red cross 
according to natsios the areas which have been subject to air 
raids recently all had been designated as off limits to offensive 
military operations by the government and had been regarded as safe 
for the relief operations 
two officials who discussed the issue on condition of 
anonymity 
disagreed as to whether the headquarters of these relief 
operations were targets of the air raids one official said he 
believes the real targets were rebel military encampments but 
another said the sudanese government is eager to stop the relief 
efforts because they assist people in rebelheld areas 
the objective is to run unicef out the official said 
unicef runs intensive feeding programs child immunization programs 
and other militarily threatening programs he noted with heavy 
sarcasm 
sudanese president omar elbashir plans to join about 70 other 
heads of government this weekend at the united nations for the 
world summit for children president bush also plans to attend 
a sudanese embassy official had no comment on the us 
allegations saying we have no news from the sudan at this 
time 
the united states has for years been attempting to persuade both 
sides in sudans civil war to agree to a cease fire the war 
involves the largely moslem north against the mostly nonmoslem 
south 
richard reid the regional unicef director for the middle east 
and north africa said he was aware of bombing raids in the bor 
area but was unable to say who the planes belonged to 
he said 250000 persons died in sudan two years ago from disease 
and starvation but that a major international effort called 
operation lifeline sudan succeeded in preventing a similar calamity 
last year 
this year he said were facing a repetition of 1988 because 
crop failures have set in were facing a human tragedy that could 
surpass 1988 the 150 million sudanese food aid request would 
provide about 970000 tons of wheat 10 times more than the amount 
sent last year under the lifeline program

democrat howell heflin pokes fun at 
guccipoochie republicans and cultivates the image of a 
backslapping southern politician as he asks voters to reelect him 
to the us senate 
but his republican challenger is hoping to cut short heflins 
senate career with the same kind of upset that democrat richard 
shelby pulled off in alabama in 1986 against republican sen 
jeremiah denton 
every poll shows us closing says state sen bill cabaniss 
the race is winnable 
cabaniss has a lot of distance to close polls put heflins 
lead at about 31 this summer 
his longshot campaign is getting some highlevel help 
president bush vice president dan quayle and federal drug czar 
william bennett have come to alabama to campaign for him and 
former president reagan is coming saturday 
heflin who at times plays the role of a country store humorist 
fills his campaign speeches with jokes about republicans or as he 
calls them the grey poupon crowd the guccipoochiecoochie 
shoewearing mercedesdriving poloplaying jacuzzisoaking 
perrierdrinking aspenskiing ritzy rich highsociety 
republicans who eat broccoli 
cabaniss does live in mountain brook birminghams wealthiest 
suburb and was a director of alabamas largest bank until he 
resigned to prevent any conflict with his senate bid he also 
belongs to an allwhite country club but he drives an 
americanmade car and has long worn plain support shoes 
if thats all heflin has to run on personalities and 
personal criticism he has no business being a us senator 
cabaniss said i consider politics serious business 
cabaniss 52 has earned a reputation as being all business 
during his four years in the alabama house and eight in the state 
senate his starched white shirt and short slickedback hair have 
become trademarks of a man who explores the smallest details of 
state budgets 
heflin 69 resembles the stereotypical southern politician with 
his hefty frame creamcolored suits and warm personality but his 
work on the senate judiciary committee has earned him a reputation 
as a thoughtful questioner of presidential appointments and as one 
who often casts the deciding vote 
heflins senate voting record shows him siding with the 
republican administration more than 70 percent of the time and 
often being more loyal than some republican senators including 
quayle in 1988 
but his crucial votes on the judiciary committee against robert 
borks nomination to the supreme court and us attorney jeff 
sessions nomination to a federal judgeship in alabama have become 
central issues in the campaign bork himself has campaigned on 
cabaniss behalf 
when you look at the votes that define a persons philosophy 
you are going to see mr heflin lined up with ted kennedy and 
joseph biden cabaniss said 
pat cotter a university of alabama political scientist and 
pollster said heflins conservative voting record on economic and 
social issues has left cabaniss without the usual campaign issues 
raised by republicans 
one indication of that is cabaniss use of the environmental 
issue which is not normally a republican issue cotter said 
cabaniss spent a month paddling alabama rivers during the summer 
campaign he has picked up endorsements from environmental groups 
including the alabama sierra club that were upset by heflin votes 
against stronger amendments to the clean air act and to delay 
legislation that would expand a federal wilderness area in north 
alabama 
heflin who was first elected to the senate in 1978 dismissed 
the endorsements as coming from extremist groups he said the 
groups ignored many strong points in his environmental record 
including getting double liners installed at alabamas giant 
hazardous waste landfill 
last week cabaniss called on heflin to resign as chairman of 
the senate ethics committee because he accepted a 2000 
contribution last year from a political action committee affiliated 
with sen aln cranston who is under investigation by the 
committee for his intervention with bank regulators 
heflin said the donation was unsolicited and the name of the 
donor the national committee for democratic consensus gave no 
indication it was tied to the california senator after discovering 
the donations origin in july 1990 we returned it out of an 
abundance of caution heflin said 
along with a lead in the polls heflin is running well ahead in 
campaign funds financial reports on june 30 showed him with 27 
million compared to cabaniss 444000 
cotter and margaret latimer an auburn university political 
scientist specializing in alabama politics said heflin appears to 
have nothing to worry about 
i perceive him to be very safe latimer said i dont 
think cabaniss has brought up much he can hold against heflin 
except the environmental issue

iraq has threatened to execute us and other diplomats unless 
they hand over westerners theyre sheltering and an american 
warship fired across the bow of an iraqi tanker today to force it 
to stop and submit to a search 
the threat against the diplomats was contained in official 
statements to the us french and british embassies in baghdad 
wednesday and today 
the iraqi foreign ministry today refused to comment on the 
statement but iraqi officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the memo only contained a reminder of an iraqi law issued 
when iraq annexed kuwait last month which stipulated that those 
who provide refuge for foreigners could be punished by death the 
officials said the law applies only to iraqis 
the iraqi statement first disclosed by secretary of state james 
a baker iii on wednesday was denounced by western governments 
today

personnel to participate in un peacekeeping activities 
kaifu acknowledged criticism that japan is supplying little more 
than money to the usled force deployed in the middle east in 
response to iraqs invasion of kuwait kaifu is to travel friday to 
the united states where some of the harshest criticism has been 
voiced 
hurt by new and tougher trade sanctions iraqs leaders said

the man described by witnesses as an iranian in his 30s was 
shot when he got close enough to a window that we were able to

veteran police negotiators concluded there was no other way to 
resolve the standoff 
the gunman who had been drinking beer all night would 
alternate between hyper and coming down said polk it was 
felt that if we let it go much longer he might go off and start 
shooting people 
a young man and his girlfriend who had been hostages in the 
besieged durant hotel appeared redeyed and upset as they were 
hustled into a nearby building by authorities both declined to 
give their names 
you cant believe something like that can happen the young 
man said 
it was like living in a dream but its over now his 
companion added 
doran offered no clear motive for the attack 
we really dont know except that he is apparently upset 
because he didnt get a student loan he said 
the gunman was apparently hit by a burst of gunfire heard around 
720 am seconds later hostages some of whom had been forced to 
sit in the windows of henrys bar in the hotel as human shields 
began to run from the hotel 
the standoff began shortly after midnight when the man armed 
with a halfdozen weapons including handguns and rifles stormed 
in

the ordeal 
the gunman shot six people after entering the durant hotel 
doran said police reported two other people were shot during 
another round of gunfire about 315 am in henrys bar and grill 
on the hotels second floor 
witnesses said the shooting was punctuated by the gunman 
screaming when is it going to end how long how long 
doran said one hostage escaped at the onset of the second 
shooting spree and did not require medical attention 
the gunman who periodically sent hostages outside with messages 
for police threatened to execute a hostage if authorities did not 
turn off outside lights but those hostages were not freed and were 
ordered to return

women in the hotel to take off your pants 
another woman who managed to flee said the gunman then had

the stalled shuttle program has 
prevented nasa from ending the scorned practice of 
cannibalizing spaceship parts 
discovery due to lift off oct 6 with a satellite to study the 
sun received an auxiliary power unit and a metal grounding strap 
from atlantis in august atlantis was grounded by leaking hydrogen 
fuel in june a month after columbias hydrogen leaks were 
detected 
atlantis in turn got an auxiliary power unit this week that 
was removed from columbia atlantis is due to fly around nov 7 
four months later than planned 
were concerned because every time you remove a part from one 
orbiter and put it into another orbiter you get two chances to 
introduce a problem when you took it out of the one and when you 
put it in the other said william lenoir head of the national 
aeronautics and space administrations space flight program 
the problem is that nasa has eight serviceable auxiliary power 
units but needs nine three for each shuttle the units 
pressurize the shuttles hydraulic system 
if i dont have one on my spares shelf in stock then i 
either dont fly or i have to go get one from another orbiter 
unfortunately thats where weve found ourselves recently 
lenoir said wednesday 
the presidential commission that investigated the challenger 
explosion recommended that nasa stop removing parts from one 
shuttle to supply another nasa was forced into the situation 
because of an increasing flight rate and an insufficient supply of 
spare parts the commission concluded 
when challenger lifted off for the last time on jan 28 1986 
it had 25 cannibalized parts none of which are believed to 
have contributed to the disaster 
the number of swapped parts per flight is going down it has not 
exceeded 10 in the past two years nasa figures show the last 
shuttle flight in fact had no borrowed parts and the three before 
that each had only one 
since the last shuttle flight in april nasa also has replaced 
columbias leaky hydrogen fuel line assembly with one from 
endeavour the shuttle under construction in california 
its hard from a logistics standpoint to try to keep three 
vehicles outfitted any one of which youre trying to launch 
said roger enlow logistics director and overseer of the 220000 
shuttle parts 
if you had had the first flight go when the first flight was 
supposed to you would have had them parts in the right ones 
said ann montgomery deputy director of logistics 
of the 220000 parts that make up each shuttle about 55000 are 
stocked at kennedy space center there is not enough room and money 
to stock more montgomery said besides some components need to be 
replaced so infrequently it would be impractical to keep extras on 
hand she said 
although more spares are available now one of the many changes 
resulting from the 1986 challenger accident there never can be 
enough enlow said 
cannibalization can never totally be avoided theres just not 
enough money to do that enlow said 
the current logistics budget totals 193 million nasa is 
seeking 210 million for fiscal 1991 which begins monday 
the last time nasa had an extra auxiliary power unit or apu 
was in july another is expected in november from the manufacturer 
sundstrand corp of rockford ill but nasa officials are 
uncertain whether it like many of late will be unusable because 
of cracked valve seats 
nasa is reluctant to order more apus at 2 million each 
since an upgraded model is due out early next year 
formal approval from about a dozen nasa officials is necessary 
before parts can be swapped the board is much less prone to grant 
such sanctions than it was before challengers seven crew members 
were killed said jay greene deputy manager of the shuttle program 
office at johnson space center in houston 
david acheson said he and others on the presidential commission 
opposed the practice because of the degree of uncertainty 
introduced each time a part is swapped 
if you multiply those uncertainties however small they may 
appear individually you are necessarily increasing the risk of 
some maladjustment or some slight injury to a component or some 
little glitch in the assembly said acheson executive director 
of george washington universitys institute for technology and 
strategic research 
nasa recently learned the risk of tampering with installed 
components while searching for contamination in columbias engine 
compartment following the shuttles january flight workers 
apparently crushed a seal on a valve which contributed to the 
hydrogen leak more such damage is feared

evangelist pat robertson charged thursday that 
a childrens puppet show featuring simulated oral sex was performed 
last week at an atlanta arts festival allegedly subsidized by the 
national endowment for the arts 
robertsons claims were vigorously denied by the nea the 
georgia state arts council and puppeteer jon ludwig of atlanta 
this is just the latest example of the continual distortion of 
fact by the arts endowments most virulent critics those intent on 
eliminating the agency at any cost even that of the truth said 
chief nea spokesman jack lichtenstein 
robertson said the puppet show performed at the atlanta arts 
festival last friday before 800 people including children 
featured approximately five minutes of simulated foreplay between 
two puppets followed by an exhibit of oral sex acts 
robertson a 1988 presidential candidate said his christian 
coalition in chesapeake va responded by generating 27000 
petitions demanding that the nea be abolished and sending them 
tuesday to every member of congress 
the atlanta arts festival is supposed to be a family affair 
robertson said in a statement if the weirdos on the federal dole 
do not stop peddling obscenity and pornography members of congress 
will hear from angry voters in november 
robertson said 8 percent of the festivals 760000 budget came 
from public sources including nea money funneled through the 
georgia council on the arts a state government agency 
but lichtenstein and frank ratka the councils execttive 
director denied that any nea funds went to the festival ratka 
said the council gave the festival 33500 in state funds only this 
year 
the lichtenstein ratka and patrician gann executive director 
of the atlanta festival said the puppet show was financed entirely 
by earned income such as ticket sales and concessions and 
received neither federal nor state funds 
ludwig artistic director of the center for puppetry arts in 
atlanta who wrote and directed the festival puppet show denied 
that it contained simulated oral sex he characterized it as a 
morality play intended only for adult audiences 
the show was titled zeitgeist or the spirit of our times 
the spirit that always denies and contained a 60second scene in 
which a demon used the bottom half of a female mannequin to lure 
the plays artist hero 
this was a scene about temptation ludwig said it was 
intended to be satirical after all what literally happened is 
that two pieces of plastic rubbed against each other 
the intent was to satirize all the lust and all this hoohaw 
over lust in our society he said it was not simulated oral 
sex its impossible how can puppets do that they dont even have 
the parts it was like finding children playing with ken and barbie 
dolls in the back room and calling pat robertson 
ludwig said the puppet show got a standing ovation from the 
audience a rave review in the local press and only one complaint 
which ms gann said came from a marietta ga clergyman 
ms gann said the festival theater stage was fenced off from 
general view because of the adult nature of evening performances 
about a halfdozen children were among the audience of 800 people 
at the puppet show despite warning signs and preperformance 
announcements to parents that the material was unsuitable for 
children she said 
robertsons latest attack on the nea came as house members 
braced for an emotional floor battle over legislative proposals to 
extend the endowments life past sunday when its statutory 
authority expires 
plans to begin floor debate late this week were scrapped partly 
to give house negotiators more time to draft a compromise bill 
aimed at satisfying conservative lawmakers demands for assurances 
that the nea wont spend federal funds on obscene or blasphemous 
art 
the debate was expected to begin sometime next week 
robertson said that in addition to flooding congressional 
offices with petitions demanding a fund cutoff for the nea the 
christian coalition is distributing literature and photographs from 
a controversial exhibit of works by photographer robert 
mapplethorpe to the districts of wavering members of congress 
in several states 
conservative criticism of an nea grant underwriting the 
mapplethorpe exhibit prompted congress to approve a ban last fall 
on federal support for works that may be considered obscene 
including depictions of homoeroticism and sadomasochism and sexual 
exploitation of children

a decoy doesnt count as wildlife a 
judge said as he reversed the convictions of two hunters who were 
bagged by state game officers for shooting at a stuffed deer 
aaron j stiffey sr 46 of bolivar and james wagner 31 of 
new florence were arrested dec 7 1989 during buckhunting 
season 
they were charged with shooting at the decoy from a vehicle on a 
public road not wearing proper hunting garb or having their 
hunting licenses and having loaded firearms in their pickup truck 
wildlife officers testified that the decoy nicknamed officer 
buck was shot twice and that they saw stiffey fire one of the 
shots and they said that when stiffey was cited he remarked i 
guess you got me 
westmoreland county common pleas judge richard e mccormick jr 
on wednesday ruled on appeal that there was no evidence against 
wagner and he overturned stiffeys conviction because the stuffed 
deer was not alive and did not meet the state definition of 
wildlife 
assistant district attorney patrick noonan said the use of the 
stuffed fivepoint buck was not entrapment as the men had argued 
the use of this decoy is no different than an undercover 
policemen soliciting for prostitution he said 
stiffey had been fined 64850 and wagner was fined 54850 
after they were convicted by a magistrate

president mikhail s gorbachev began using his 
sweeping new powers to rescue the collapsing soviet economy on 
thursday ordering businesses to fulfill supply contracts and the 
government to ensure distribution 
but it was far from clear that people would comply with his 
order many are uncertain how they will fit in the market economy 
gorbachev is trying to establish and they find it more profitable 
to trade goods on the black market rather than distribute them in 
the established structure 
a western specialist called the order a waste of time 
in his first decree since the supreme soviet legislature on 
monday granted him new powers to shore up the economy and maintain 
law and order gorbachev said told government businesses 
regardless of their administrative subordination and location 
to preserve economic ties he said the businesses should meet all 
contract obligations for raw materials and other goods in the last 
quarter of this year and throughout 1991 
it is during that period that the country will be trying to 
switch from a centrally planned to a market economy under a plan 
the supreme soviet is to select after oct 15 
gorbachevs decree read on the nightly tv newscast vremya 
and released by the tass news agency was an attempt to preserve 
the status quo at a time when many businesses are trying to bypass 
moscow and trade directly with each other 
the restive republics for instance have been signing economic 
cooperation agreements in a preliminary step toward a common 
market that leaves the moscow ministries which since the 1920s 
have issued fiveyear plans that told thousands of factories farms 
and businesses what to produce where to sell it and how much to 
charge out of the picture 
gorbachev said it was impermissible that managers had 
disrupted economic ties and referred to the extraordinary nature 
of the situation 
in a harkening back to bolshevik appeals to the proletariat 
gorbachev urged workers to join their bosses in making sure 
contracts are kept he also said the council of ministers the 
soviet cabinet should if necessary introduce a special regime 
for the operation of railways and other allstate lifesustaining 
systems of the country 
bottlenecks in railroad deliveries in part caused by a shortage 
of railroad cars have reportedly disrupted the distribution of 
food and other goods nationwide soviets face shortages of housing 
food and consumer goods and the government daily izvestia on 
thursday warned that power failures are possible this winter 
because fuel reserves are running low and twothirds of power 
equipment is worn out and unreliable 
jan vanous director of the economics research firm planecon 
called gorbachevs decree misdirected 
what the soviets need is price liberalization vanous said 
in a telephone interview from his washington office passing some 
decree on relations between enterprises is a waste of time 
several proposals before the supreme soviet legislature would 
free prices of goods now set by the government the most radical 
blueprint written by economist stanislav shatalin calls for 
junking the central planning system and moving to a market economy 
within 500 days by selling factories to private owners and breaking 
up collective farms 
gorbachev had said he would not wait for the economic rescue 
plan to be approved before issuing decrees to stablize the economy 
but vanous said gorbachev is making a mistake 
what is needed for stabilization is destabilization unleash 
market forces and let the economy take a deep plunge then it 
stabilizes he said 
several statistics point to a breakdown of the system 
interior ministry officials said investigators have found 
corruption at half the 160000 businesses they inspected this year 
and incidents of serious embezzlement are running at twice last 
years level 
from january through june the gross national product dropped 1 
percent and labor productivity fell 15 percent government reports 
have said at the same time the government printed 9 percent more 
rubles and the average wage for industrial and service workers shot 
up

the latest republican proposal for breaking 
the deadlock over deficit reduction would give president bush the 
capitalgains tax cut he demands only the method would be 
different 
instead of excluding a flat 30 percent of longterm capital 
gains from taxation as the president proposes the new plan would 
exclude an amount that would vary with the inflation rate 
backers of a capitalgains cut say the new proposal called 
indexing would increase incentives for investment although in the 
short run the punch might not be as strong as under bushs 
plan opponents who have shown no sign of endorsing the new 
proposal say it has the same flaw as its predecessor the lions 
share of the tax cut would go to those with incomes over 100000 a 
year 
its still a capitalgains cut rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee an opponent of a reduction 
said after the indexing proposal was offered to deficit negotiators 
earlier in the week 
indexing is designed to prevent taxation of capital gains that 
result only from inflation 
present law taxes capital gains which are profits from the 
sale of investments at the same rates applying to wages and other 
income 15 percent 28 percent and 33 percent 
assume for example that a piece of real estate was bought in 
1983 for 50000 and sold in 1990 for 100000 under present law 
the 50000 profit would be taxed fully a person in the 28 percent 
bracket would pay 14000 
under bushs original plan 30 percent of the 50000 or 
15000 would be excluded from taxation resulting in a tax of 
9800 for a person in the 28 percent bracket 
because consumer prices have risen about 25 percent since 1983 
onequarter of the 50000 profit is illusory that portion has not 
increased the sellers purchasing power at all 
under a proposal for fully indexing against inflation that 25 
percent would not be taxed leaving the seller in the 28 percent 
bracket with a tax bill of 10500 instead of 14000 
sellers of longheld property might be better off with indexing 
than under bushs original plan in other cases a flat exclusion 
would be more profitable 
details of the indexing proposal being considered by the 
negotiators have not been made public leaving key questions 
unanswered would investors be protected fully against inflation 
or perhaps only against inflation above 2 percent or 3 percent a 
year would capital losses caused solely by inflation by 
deductible 
before 1986 only 40 percent of gains were taxed with a maximum 
incometax rate of 50 percent that had the effect of a top 
capitalgains tax rate of 20 percent 
if bushs original proposal for a 30 percent exclusion were to 
become law the richest americans who pay a maximum incometax 
rate of 28 percent would pay 196 percent on capital gains 
however some uppermiddleincome people who face a top rate of 33 
percent would pay a top capitalgains rate of 231 percent 
past attempts to index capital gains have prompted protests that 
this would discriminate against other investors whose money is in 
savings accounts or other investments that also are hurt by 
inflation

a former us foreign aid official was 
sentenced thursday to nine months in prison for accepting 11130 
from a medical consultant who was awarded contracts for 
publichealth assistance programs 
john massey who was also fined 2000 by us district judge 
george revercomb was the last of three defendants who received 
prison terms for corrupting the award of contracts for aid projects 
in central america 
earlier this year the no 2 official who supervised 
humanitarian aid to the nicaraguan contras was given a 12month 
sentence by another federal judge 
that official donald f enos the former deputy director of the 
agencys task force for humanitarian assistance to central america 
pleaded guilty to accepting nearly 100000 in bribes from medical 
consultant george f kraus 
a firm owned by kraus who began cooperating with investigators 
after he was videotaped paying a 3000 bribe to an undercover 
operative once had 35 million worth of consulting contracts with 
aid officials said 
revercomb sentenced kraus on sept 11 to eight months in prison 
and fined him 6000 for bribing the undercover operative of the 
aid inspector generals office 
masseys sentencing thursday came on his guilty plea to 
conspiring to defraud the government a charge that carried a 
maximum sentence of five years imprisonment 
the aid project officer in guatemala city guatemala from 1987 
to 1989 massey 51 admitted receiving the money during a time 
when he was giving kraus inside information about contracts the 
agency was preparing to put out for bids massey also admitted 
helping kraus write bid proposal documents 
defense attorney howard katzoff sought leniency for his client 
noting that massey was recently divorced and a recovering alcoholic 
when he first met kraus in 1987 
katzoff argued that while massey had some influence over how the 
contracts were awarded he did not control the process 
but justice department prosecutor david green said that massey 
held a position of trust and he abused that trust 
this kind of government corruption calls for some period of 
incarceration as the only way to send the message that this type of 
conduct is totally intolerable in our system green argued

the us chamber of commerce has waged an 
elaborate secret campaign for the 1990 nobel peace prize 
according to internal documents and former officials of the 
business group 
the business federation which nicknamed its campaign special 
project courted us lawmakers world leaders and a former 
prizewinner to get itself nominated for the award the documents 
show it hired an editor to research and prepare a narrative of the 
chambers overseas activities 
the award worth 653000 this year will be announced on oct 
15 in oslo norway 
candidates may be nominated by previous laureates members of 
parliaments or political science faculty members of selected 
universities the chambers pitch was that it has helped bring 
democracy and a free enterprise economy to eastern europe and third 
world countries 
nominations closed on feb 1 the chamber was nominated by david 
a morse a new york attorney who was director general of the 
international labor organization which won the prize in 1969 and 
sen richard lugar rind 
id be embarrassed if i were promoting myself that much 
said barry king the organizations media relations director until 
june it seems to me the people who have won it didnt need to 
toot their own horn so much 
but milt mitler chamber vice president for public liaison said 
wednesday it was not a campaign we were nominated for the prize 
by sen lugar and mr morse we had to give them both historic 
information on what the chamber does or has done 
being nominated is a feather in our cap mitler said 
last year the chamber drafted a nominating letter that said it 
richly deserves international recognition for its bold and 
visionary leadership in the cause of human freedom which is a 
prerequisite to world peace the nominating process is secret 
and it is uncertain whether morse or lugar used the letter 
the campaign was the chambers secret project they were 
consumed by it during a threemonth period said king who 
resigned from the chamber to become a private consultant in 
atlanta details of the campaign were also provided by a second 
former chamber official on condition of anonymity 
however mitler said how could we push ourself you cant 
contact the committee we did not go out and canvass people we did 
not advertise 
last years winner was the dalai lama tibets religious and 
political leader polish solidarity leader lech walesa and indias 
mother teresa also are recent winners 
rep lee hamilon dind declined a request by chamber 
president richard lesher and other chamber officials to nominate 
the business group hamilton told lesher that he just could not 
nominate because it would be inappropriate according to a 
chamberprepared chronology that chronicled the campaign from 
september 1989 through last january 
in december 1989 hamilton had been visited by lesher mitler 
and other chamber officials and presented a document about the 
business group and a proposed nominating letter hamilton who 
declined comment this week said at the time that he doesnt 
think he has the clout in norwayto make a difference according 
to a chamber outline of the meeting 
the chamber devoted time to gathering information on the award 
from various sources including the committee in norway 
strategizing on how best to secure nominator support and making the 
appropriate contacts its chronology said 
the chamber is a federation of 180000 businesses trade and 
professional associations and satellite chambers in the 50 states 
and overseas members pay dues and receive publications and a 
voice in chamber programs and lobbying 
according to the chronology the chambers original list of 
potential nominators included former president reagan turkish 
president turgut ozal egyptian president hosni mubarak and oscar 
arias the former costa rican president and a nobel winner before 
narrowing the list the chamber assigned officials to try to win 
nominations from each leader as well as from morse and lugar 
the nobel selection committee whose members are elected by the 
norwegian parliament says it is not swayed by lobbyists or by 
thousands of letters promoting favorites among candidates 
norwegian news reports said this years nominees include soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and czechoslovakias president vaclav 
havel and former foreign minister jiri hajek

from independence hall to yosemite national 
park americas best known landmarks are already feeling the sting 
of the federal budget crisis 
the roof at independence hall leaks yosemite had to scale back 
its 100th birthday party and a texas memorial had to cancel a 
popular folk festival for the first time in 18 years 
things could get worse 
the cash crunch threatens to make the washington monument into a 
massive symbol not only of americas first president but of a 
government unable to operate its historic treasures 
absent a congressional budget agreement before monday the 
monument would have to close on the two days producing the least 
number of visitors probably mondays and tuesdays the national 
park service said thursday 
for years the park service has been accused of gamesmanship 
by threatening to close such a visible and popular monument said 
park service spokesman duncan morrow 
the washington monument has been the great symbol of the 
budget game for several years but under the basic rules of 
grammrudman the budget deficit law each park is a separate item 
that has to get the same degree of cut morrow said 
the statue of liberty would also shut down two days a week the 
park service said 
budgets are already lean at national parks and monuments but 
administrators are preparing for the possibility that the president 
may have to order automatic spending cuts monday the first day of 
the governments 1991 fiscal year 
that would force most government agencies including the park 
service to trim expenses by 324 percent 
already philadelphias independence national historical park 
has announced the indefinite closing of the second bank of the 
united states the marine corps museum the armynavy museum and 
old city hall 
the parks most popular attractions the liberty bell and 
independence hall remain open but independence halls roof is in 
disrepair prompting an urgent plea from rep thomas foglietta 
dpa not to allow a vital part of this countrys history to 
slide into ruin 
provisions of the grammrudmanhollings budget deficit law 
require the park service to impose reductions evenhandedly on its 
nearly 600 parks programs and activities parks could choose to 
absorb the cuts in different ways 
at grand canyon national park the 324 percent cut would 
probably mean reductions in the number of seasonal staff said 
spokesman chuck lundy that could jeopardize operation of the park 
entrance stations which collect 5 fees from motorists 
in hawaii the uss arizona memorial to americans killed at pearl 
harbor would close one or two days a week said chief ranger gary 
warshefski 
interior secretary manuel lujan would be unable to attend 
yosemites longplanned 100th anniversary celebration scheduled 
for next week 
how can you justify to a furloughed worker the price of a 
plane ticket to fly across the country for a ceremony morrow 
asked 
administrators of the chamizal national memorial in el paso 
texas canceled next weeks 70000 music and dance festival 
celebrating a bridge of us and latin american cultures the 
memorial marks the settlement of an americanmexican border 
dispute 
its sort of a heartbreaker to everybody after 17 years we 
were starting to think we were secure said memorial

the world bank signalled for the first time 
thursday that it may not have sufficient resources to handle the 
economic shocks resulting from the persian gulf crisis without 
appealing to rich countries for extra donations 
officials of both the world bank and its sister lending 
organization the international monetary fund expressed worries 
about the possibility that the turmoil in the mideast could result 
in a global recession 
but the two institutions continued to insist that such a 
calamity could be avoided with sensible policies to control the 
inflation expected to result from the doubling of oil prices since 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
we face the risks of recession and higher inflation it is 
time for a steady response we need to maintain confidence imf 
managing director michel camdessus said at the close of the 45th 
annual meetings of the two institutions 
countries will suffer from the gulf crisis but this is 
manageable as long as debtor nations follow good policies and the 
international support matches the efforts of the countries 
themselves camdessus said 
world bank president barber conable said that if oil prices 
remain at current high levels over the next three months then his 
institution would likely not have sufficient resources to cushion 
the impact on developing countries 
he said that if that proves to be the case he would seek 
approval from the countries that make up the banks board of 
directors to establish a special fund for voluntary contributions 
from oilrich nations and others 
the money would be used to provide nointerest loans to nations 
having the greatest difficulty coping with the jump in oil prices 
and other economic fallout from the persian gulf crisis 
conable did not mention any possible candidates for such aid 
but a world bank report earlier in the week singled out 10 
countries whose economies stood to suffer the most from the iraqi 
invasion 
the list included jordan turkey and egypt the nations the bush 
administration has been focusing its fundraising effort on in a 
belief that without significant aid the resolve of these nations to 
support the campaign against saddam hussein could crumble 
the world bank report also listed morocco bangladesh india 
pakistan the philippines sri lanka and sudan as countries that 
would be seriously affected from such factors as higher oil prices 
loss of export markets and returning refugees 
if the price of oil stays up and there continues to be turmoil 
and uncertainty and an impact on the global economy clearly it 
will have a major impact on significant parts of the developing 
world conable told reporters 
his comments thursday represented a change from an earlier 
stance that the world bank did not need to create programs and 
could handle the crisis with existing resources 
in part the change of view reflected the escalating economic 
fallout that has seen world oil prices climb toward 40 per barrel 
other world bank officials suggested that the proposed new 
lending program could be used to disburse funds raised by the gulf 
crisis financial coordination group a steering committee unveiled 
in a speech by president bush to the opening session of the 
imfworld bank on tuesday however they said discussions on this 
possibility were still in a very preliminary stage 
on monday both the imf and the world bank endorsed usbacked 
proposals to boost their lending in response to the gulf crisis 
but those increases were to be made in the context of existing 
programs at both institutions 
on another matter both camdessus and conable said they had held 
discussions with a delegation from the soviet union which was 
attending this years annual meeting for the first time 
however both officials indicated it would be some time before 
the soviet union would qualify for membership something the 
soviets desire because it would allow them to tap the huge loan 
resources of both agencies 
while membership is not immediately possible both conable and 
camdessus said their institutions would provide technical advice to 
help the soviets in the massive job of reforming their economic 
system

the resumption of diplomatic ties between britain 
and iran on thursday raised modest hopes of freedom for british 
hostages in lebanon but left unresolved the original dispute over

archbishop of canterbury robert runcie the archbishops envoy 
terry waite is among three britons believed held in lebanon by

of course it does not mean all the problems are solved

democratic party chairman ronald h brown has 
no intention of sitting back and watching his party selfdestruct 
in the 1992 presidential election but he concedes his 
determination to play a major role in selecting the democratic 
nominee is a risky business 
im not advocating smokefilledroom politics he said in an 
interview i am advocating commonsense pragmatic politics which 
says were serious about winning the white house and which says if 
youre serious about that youve got to take some risks and youve 
got to be willing to take some heat 
we havent been real successful five of the last six times and 
to ignore that fact is really lacking in good judgment brown 
said this week referring to the fact the democrats have elected 
only one president since 1968 
certain to generate the most intense heat was browns idea that 
not onlyillion barrels in its strategic 
reserve japan has 208 milion barrels west germany claims 53 
million barrels sweden has 1 million barrels and the rest of 
western europe 6 million barrels according to statistics from the 
us energy information administration in washington 
the iea official said president bushs decision wednesday to 
sell 5 million barrels from the us strategic petroleum reserve 
wasnt out of line with the agencys position he said bush wanted 
to test the reserve system to be sure it works 
the official said he hadnt heard of any us effort to convince 
other countries to follow suit 
us rep john dingell a democrat from michigan who is chairman 
of house energy and commerce committee said the bush 
administration should ask west germany and japan to tap their 
stockpiles 
the international energy agencys members include the united 
states canada japan australia new zealand and virtually every 
major western european country except france and finland 
the agency estimates the total crude output by the 13 members of 
opec at 22 million barrels a day in september up from 197 million 
in july this has helped offset the loss of embargoed kuwaiti and 
iraqi oil which totalled about 48 million barrels daily 
the official said opecs increased production came primarily 
from saudi arabia which has produced an average 73 million 
barrels a day this month compared to 56 million a day in august 
given the rise in opec output the official said the world oil 
supply was manageable though not comfortable he said oil 
companies have had to draw on stockpiles during a period normally 
reserved for building up supplies ahead of the highdemand winter 
season 
the us petroleum reserve was established in 1975 as a cushion 
against potential future oil shortages bush said he may expand 
sales from the reserve if intensive and unwarranted speculation 
continues 
the united states uses more than 17 million barrels a day about 
half of it imported

the senate judiciary committee voted 131 
today to approve president bushs nomination of judge david souter 
to the supreme court 
the panel sent its recommendation to the full senate where 
confirmation was expected within a few days republicans urged a 
speedy vote so souter could take his seat before the court opens 
its term on monday 
sen edward m kennedy dmass cast the only vote against 
souter 
souter did not attend the committee session he remained in new 
hampshire listening to the proceedings from a radio in the law 
office of his close friend former state attorney general tom rath 
souter issued a statement several hours after the vote thanking 
members of the committee for their courtesy and consideration 
and said i am gratified by their action i await the decision of 
the full senate 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel joined with six other 
committee democrats and all six republicans in supporting souter 
like many of his democratic colleagues biden said he was troubled 
by uncertainty surrounding souters positions on rights issues 
including abortion 
hes about the best though that were going to be able to do 
from this administration biden said 
president bush in cleveland to campaign for republican 
candidates said the committee vote is good news for all of us 
who are committed to the constitution of the united states hell 
be a superb justice for the supreme court 
he urged the full senate to act as quickly as possible to 
confirm this man so that he could be seated when the court opens 
its session next week 
we probably have as moderate a choice as george bush will send 
to the senate said sen paul simon dill 
while souter did not attend the meeting many of the activist 
groups that worked for or against his nomination were present in 
the packed hearing room 
for nearly two hours prior to the vote 13 of the 14 senators 
read statements on their positions before the television cameras in 
the paneled committee room sen gordon humphrey a republican from 
souters home state of new hampshire submitted a written statement 
for the record saying he wanted to speed action on the vote 
kennedy broke ranks with his colleagues who wanted to give 
souter the benefit of the doubt the lesson of the past decade 
is that we must vote our fears not our hopes he said 
molly yard head of the national organization for women praised 
kennedy for his opposition telling reporters afterward that his 
action was a profile in courage a reference to a book on great 
americans written by his late brother president john f kennedy 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said womens groups and civil 
rights groups urged him to vote against souter but he said my 
sense is that david souter is a fair and openminded jurist who 
knows well the weight of the responsibilities which will be placed 
upon him 
i hope im not wrong he added 
sen orrin hatch rutah chided any democrats who use a 
litmus test on abortion in opposing souter i do not believe 
that he will impose his own policy preferences on the american 
people in the guise of judging 
souter 51 who spent 12 years on the new hampshire bench before 
joining the federal appeals court in boston this year would be the 
105th supreme court justice if confirmed by the full senate 
souter is bushs first nominee to the high court and the 
president asked the senate to confirm him before monday the first 
day of the supreme courts 199091 term 
the only announced opposition to souter in the senate was from 
lawmakers supporting abortion rights souter who would succeed 
prochoice justice william brennan would swing the court against 
abortion rights if he voted to overturn the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion 
during his confirmation hearings souter said he had not made up 
his mind on roe vs wade but given bushs antiabortion stance 
lawmakers were suspicious 
sen brock adams dwash said he will vote against 
confirmation of souter because i can find no basic commitment to 
preserving the right to privacy and the right of women to make 
their own decisions in the area of reproductive rights adams 
said in a senate floor speech 
sen bill bradley dnj said wednesday in announcing his 
opposition to souter that overturning roe vs wade would return 
us to the day when illegal backalley abortions put the lives of 
thousands of women at risk 
thats a chance im not willing to take he said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd one of two women in the senate 
said we must fear the worst because judge souter refused to 
talk about whether and how the constitution protects the women of 
america 
the senate majority appeared to be firmly in souters camp 
however 
several other democrats including four on the judiciary 
committee announced their support in advance of todays vote one 
souter ally tracking the nomination said he would be surprised if 
there were 20 votes against the nominee in the 100member senate 
sen herbert kohl dwis a committee member who announced his 
support for souter on wednesday reflected the views of many 
abortionrights lawmakers who planned to support the nomination 
at least we didnt hear him say that a woman does not have 
that right he said he told me that he would not prejudge the 
issue and maybe that is the best we can hope for at this time

indian refugees angered by harsh conditions 
and long delays in a desert transit camp attacked an airportbound 
van thursday staged demonstrations and angrily confronted a 
visiting official 
the incidents betrayed a growing frustration among the nearly 
14000 refugees at the camp some of whom have waited up to eight 
days in the heat and dust with only cucumbers tomatoes and canned 
sardines to eat 
children at the transit camp who now number in the thousands 
are suffering heat exhaustion and diarrhea another 14000 refugees 
wait in similar conditions at the adjacent camp of azraq ii while 
thousands more have been placed in camps in amman 
refugees surrounded a van as it was leaving the azraq i camp 
pulling out the nine people who were on their way to amman airport 
for the trip home according to witnesses 
the eight men and one elderly woman on the bus were named 
gujral the same as indias foreign minister kumar gujral and the 
refugees mistakenly thought they were relatives being given 
preferential treatment said dr ak amrohi first secretary at 
the indian embassy in amman 
people complain of bureaucratic bungling insufficient food and 
water and cramped conditions that make sleep impossible and the 
spread of contagious diseases increasingly likely 
some people say their passports have been lost at least one man 
saw his baggage leave on a bus without him another hasnt seen his 
family since they were put on different buses from the iraqi border 
to the transit camp 
we are trying to sort things out amhori said standing in 
an airless hot military tent where five of his staff worked at 
tables piled with blue indian passports 
but the problem is of such a huge dimension we really cant 
move things in an orderly or organized manner he said 
the indian government has been flying two planeloads of refugees 
a day out of amman but many people fear that they are being 
forgotten 
we are being told there are flights if so they must be 
moving buses straight from the border to the airport and not taking 
us out said vincent pinto who saw 100 or more refugee surround 
the van 
some people come in and go out the same day whereas others 
wait here six or seven days said ernest george a bank teller in 
kuwait until the aug 2 iraqi invasion we are all behaving 
poperly but how long how long we are desperate 
jordanian officials blame the indians for the delay while the 
indians blame the jordanian police for handing them sacks of 
unsorted passports taken from refugees on arrival 
vir singh jubal another witness to the van incident said 
jordanian police arrested an unknown number of refugees pinto said 
the detainees were released after refugees surrounded the police 
post near the camp and threatened to storm it 
camp officials denied anyone had been detained they said the 
nine people on the van were allowed to leave within a few hours 
after indian officials met with angry demonstrators 
the camp in the desert outside the oasis of azraq is buffeted 
by sandstorms that have turned the white tents orange and coated 
the beards of the men and the faces of the children with sand and 
grit 
annamma james arrived in azraq i eight days ago with 31 members 
of her family including 11 children 
the children have diarrhea there is not enough to eat look 
at us we are all dirty because there is no water to bathe the 
food we brought with us is gone tomorrow there will be nothing 
left 
gazing through glasses covered with dust she said what are 
we going to do

south african officials attending annual world 
financial meetings say theye getting an unusually warm reception 
this year but that they dont plan to create any embarrassment by 
applying for loans 
south african finance minister barend du plessis said the 
wellreceived visit of president fw de klerk to washington 
earlier this week would have no shortterm economic impact but he 
said it would help build credibility as the country dismantles its 
white supremacist system of apartheid 
chris stals head of the south african government bank said 
there were no plans to apply for imf loans because of the us 
sanctions 
it would unavoidably lead to discussions of the situation with 
the us congress and could embarrass us stals said 
stals who was attending his 22nd imfworld bank meeting said 
private bankers generally talked to him in the past because they 
wanted to be polite or were curious about south africa 
but this year theyre much more interested in the basic 
realities he said theyre updating files and preparing to 
do business again 
du plessis stals and other south african officials talked to 
reporters during the annual meeting of the international monetary 
fund and its related institution the world bank 
despite south africas past political isolation because of 
apartheid du plessis said the country has had normal relations 
with world financial institutions and was a founding member of both 
the imf and the world bank 
it has however been denied a seat on the banks board of 
directors and any application for imf loans must be referred to the 
us treasury secretary congress has imposed sanctions against 
south africa because of apartheid 
du plessis said south africa could use help in its efforts to 
grow economically 
it is a strange thing for us to be regarded as a developed 
country with very definite needs he said 
south africa has complied with all commitments to the two 
institutions paying off its last loans several years ago he said 
however its ineligible for world bank loans because its per 
capita income exceeds 2000

polands finance minister said thursday the 
effects of the persian gulf crisis combined with failure to ease 
the massive polish debt were endangering his countrys attempt to 
turn capitalist 
the loss of revenue from business contracts with iraq and 
kuwait in addition to the rising price of oil will cost poland 2 
billion over the coming year said leszek balcerowicz 
poland has been very severely hit at a very delicate time 
of the reform program he told reporters 
iraq had been selling oil to poland at cutrate prices in return 
for a writeoff of an estimated 600 million debt incurred during 
the eightyear iraniraq war poland also sold iraq large 
quantities of weapons and polish companies were engaged in 
construction projects for iraqs postwar rehabilitation officials 
said 
the aug 2 invasion of kuwait has stopped all that and sent 
some 1000 polish workers home 
the crash reform program initiated jan 1 by polands first 
noncommunist government is designed to turn the centralized 
economy into a marketdriven capitalist system government 
subsidies to businesses have been cut off raising prices sharply 
and forcing enterprises to become competitive or go bankrupt 
resulting layoffs have driven unemployment to 5 percent a level 
unknown under the communist party which ruled poland until last 
year 
balcerowicz who also serves as deputy prime minister said 
polands top priority was to trim its 40billion debt twothirds 
of which is owed to other governments and the rest to banks 
how can we convince people theres a light at the end of the 
tunnel with the growing debt overhang he said

reporters who cover events that lead to 
civil lawsuits cant be jailed for refusing to provide notes 
photographs or news sources to parties in the suits the state 
supreme court ruled thursday 
the unanimous decision said a shield law added to the california 
constitution by voters in 1980 protects reporters from being held 
in contempt of court for withholding confidential sources notes or 
unpublished material 
the court ruled in may that the law can be breached in a 
criminal case requiring a reporter to provide evidence necessary 
to protect a defendants constitutional right to a fair trial but 
the justices said thursday that parties in a civil case have no 
similar constitutional right 
this is a complete victory for the journalists and the 
public said c michael cooney lawyer for the new york times 
co publisher of the santa barbara newspress 
the ruling was prompted by a lawsuit involving newspress 
photographer robert ponce 
the photographer took pictures of an auto accident on a us 101 
ramp in june 1984 two of which appeared in the newspaper 
volkswagen of america sued by an injured passenger sought ponces 
unpublished photos as evidence 
santa barbara county superior court judge patrick mcmahon 
ordered the newspaper to release the photos saying they showed 
public events and were not confidential the 2nd district court of 
appeal overturned his ruling and was upheld by the state supreme

democrats asked the federal election 
commission on thursday to halt a republican fundraising scheme 
they said could illegally raise millions of dollars for gop senate 
candidates 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee asked the 
commission to put an immediate stop to the republican 
senatorial inner circle which already has disbursed about 1 
million to dozens of candidates 
the inner circle is a dressedup version of a 1986 gop 
operation that the fec found in violation of limits on party 
contributions said bob bauer general counsel for the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee 
republicans defend the inner circle as a legitimate joint 
fundraising operation exempt from the contribution limits 
federal law allows party committees to give candidates 17500 
and spend an additional amount on their behalf according to 
individual state populations 
a federal judge last year ruled in a lawsuit filed by common 
cause that the national republican senatorial committee illegally 
funneled 27 million in individual contributions to a dozen 1986 
senate candidates through a maneuver known as bundling the fec 
has asked the court to fine the nrsc as much as 27 million 
the differences between the 1986 and 1990 operations are no 
more than cosmetic the democrats said in a complaint filed with 
the fec 
the inner circle cannot qualify as a joint fundraising 
operation if nrsc controls where the money goes provides the staff 
and receives just 1 percent of the money it raises the complaint 
said 
the scale of the effort is extraordinary the complaint 
said it is the most monumental fundraising effort ever mounted 
by a national party committee on behalf of its individual federal 
candidates 
nrsc spokeswoman wendy burnley called the complaint a last 
gasp desperate attempt to gain press attention particularly in the 
states where the most hotly contested campaigns are going on 
democrats are worried about the money that the inner circle 
could infuse into campaigns for television advertising that could 
tip some close races she said 
the operation replaces a fundraising program started 11 years 
ago in which 1000 donors were invited to washington for briefings 
on issues and social events with republican lawmakers and 
officials burnley said the inner circle is run separately from 
the nrsc which is reimbursed for staff costs she said 
the operation expects to raise as much as 115 million this 
year with most of that going to gop candidates according to a 
letter mailed to potential contributors under the signature of vice 
president dan quayle 
four dozen campaigns are members of the inner circle including 
the 27 candidates running this year and 21 gop senators who face 
reelection in 1992 or 1994 contributions are divided according to 
a formula based on the needs of the candidates 
candidates received shares of 7200 to 43500 in june and 
additional amounts in august mostly in amounts of 4000 to 
10000 according to fec records

the airline industry thursday asked president 
bush to exempt air traffic controllers from furloughs if a budget 
agreement isnt reached by monday 
your action would ensure continuity in the daytoday 
operation of our air traffic control system robert j aaronson 
president of the air transport association of america said in a 
letter to the president 
aaronson said traffic controllers maintenance technicians 
safety inspectors and weather personnel are vital to the safe and 
efficient operation of the nations air traffic control system 
this is essential to protect the overall public interest as 
well as the continuing viability of the nations airline industry 
and the many other industries which depend on it he said 
stephen hart deputy white house press secretary said the 
administration would not respond until and unless mondays deadline 
is reached without agreement to avoid deep budget cuts 
progress was reported thursday in the continuing talks 
a good deal has been agreed to tentatively said house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash 
one administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the air traffic controllers were likely to be 
exempted even if an agreement isnt reached 
the administration has said it will continue essential services 
on the basis of an opinion issued by attorney general benjamin 
civiletti during the carter administration 
if budget negotiators fail to reach an accord by the start of 
the new fiscal year monday the federal aviation administration has 
proposed to furlough each of its controllers for two days every two 
weeks that would mean an average 25 percent reduction in the 
number of controllers available for work each day 
jack ryan association vice president for air traffic 
management said plans called for dealing with the situation by 
delaying flights next monday tuesday and wednesday 
on thursday he said flight cancellations would begin 
he said delays at major airports would be in excess of three 
or four or five hours if the weather was good and even longer if 
it was bad 
aaronson told reporters its absolutely ludicrous to hold the 
air traffic control system of the country hostage to a budget 
crisis

the dramatic runup in oil prices is 
boosting alaskas treasury and has prompted the administration to 
propose restoring millions of dollars to programs that were cut in 
july 
one of eight barrels of north slope oil goes to the state which 
also derives revenues from severance taxes on oil production the 
state derives 85 percent of its revenue from oil and gas 
production a 1 a barrel increase in oil prices adds 150 million 
in yearly revenues to the state treasury 
oil prices shot up from 13 a barrel in july to current spot 
market prices of 37 a barrel fueled by fear of war with iraq 
state budget director alison elgee said a proposed 50 million 
supplemental spending package of more than 50 million is being 
prepared for the next governor who will be elected in november any 
new spending plan would have to be approved by the legislature 
which convenes in midjanuary 
elgee said about half the proposed supplemental expenditures 
would go toward restoration of programs and services cut by 
democratic gov steve cowpers vetoes in july the rest would cover 
such things as state employee wage increases and expenses for oil 
spill litigation she said 
current state spending is pegged at 26 billion for the current 
fiscal year cowper cut 325 million in july citing sagging oil 
prices and overspending by the legislature 
cowper who is not seeking reelection said he wants the state 
to save most of the windfall generated by the middle east crisis 
i think most people believe there will be a substantial 
surplus cowper said my view is that most of the money should 
be saved were not going to recommend enormous sums be put back 
into the budget

part of a cargo door that tore away from a 
united airlines jet over the pacific ocean in 1989 has been 
recovered from the ocean floor 100 miles south of honolulu the 
national transportation safety board announced today 
nine people died when the door and a large chunk of fuselage 
broke off from the boeing 747 shortly after takeoff from honolulu 
international airport on feb 14 1989 
the board said the recovered piece the lower half of the door 
measures 6 feet by 10 feet 
the announcement said the fragment was recovered overnight from 
a field of debris at a depth of 14100 feet officials said they 
hoped to retrieve the other half of the door by the end of the 
week 
the board said the navy submarine sea cliff videotaped the piece 
of the airplane on the ocean floor and raised it to the surface 
with hydraulic jaws it was brought onto the deck of the navy 
vessel the laney choust at about 5 am edt today midnight 
honolulu time 
the safety board said a preliminary examination by one of its 
investigators showed the door had fractured longitudinally near the 
midspan latch the eight sectors of the latch lock were all in the 
locked position and were deformed 
the board said the sea cliff had also detected a strong sonar 
target near the spot where the door portion was found it said the 
submarine would return to try to locate the remainder of the door 
after being recharged for about 20 hours 
after investigators examine the recovered debris parts of it 
will be sent to boeing in seattle for a more detailed review under 
board direction officials said 
the door flew off after united airlines flight 811 experienced 
an explosive decompression at about 23000 feet

the persian gulf buildup will be insulated 
from possible mandatory budget cuts but other military operations 
will be severely affected the defense department said thursday 
one of the goals is to try to prevent any impact on operation 
desert shield said pentagon spokesman pete williams we are 
attempting to isolate that from the effects of a sequestration 
but williams said other spending would be cut by as much as 353 
percent in all areas except military personnel 
the readiness of military forces outside the persian gulf area 
where about 150000 us military personnel are on guard against an 
attack by iraq against saudi arabia would have to be degraded 
he said 
cuts in such operations of a third to one half could be 
expected he said 
if cuts are made the pentagon said 
disruption of the work force would be avoided as much as 
possible but civilian employees of some small defense agencies 
could expect furloughs of several days 
a temporary halt of payments in all medical benefit claims made 
by army civilians and their families and by the families of army 
personnel would be ordered 
depot maintenance and other logistics programs would be done 
out at the lowest practicable level while still supporting 
desert shield the pentagon said that would mean revoking nato 
agreements adding that posed the potential for grounding aircraft 
all base engineering and housing construction and maintenance 
would be deferred except for work to correct lifethreatening 
conditions or to address major environmental concerns 
travel transportation rents and utilities would be severely 
restricted 
there is a possibility congress may extend the deadline for 
budget cuts beyond monday the start of the 1991 fiscal year to 
give white house and congressional negotiators more time to reach a 
budget compromise williams said 
but if sequestration is not suspended then the impact would 
be very severe here he said

public school officials have approved of a plan 
to create two schools next year that will cater to the needs and 
experiences of young black male students 
the milwaukee school board voted 53 wednesday night to 
designate an elementary school and a middle school beginning with 
the 199192 school year as africanamerican immersion schools 
milwaukee is believed to be the first public school district in 
the nation to approve a specific curriculum for black males 
supporters said the district of columbias school board is 
considering a similar plan 
its fair to say that the achievement levels of 
africanamerican males have not been good said milwaukee school 
spokesman dave begel this is an attempt to improve it 
while the two experimental schools will be open to all students 
to comply with antidiscrimination laws their curriculum will 
stress african heritage and the special educational social and 
emotional needs of young black males begel said 
more than 50 percent of the milwaukee public school districts 
98000 students are black supporters claim many blacks suffer low 
achievement in the district because they lose their identity or 
become discouraged by a curriculum that stresses the heritage of 
whites 
a citizens task force initiated the africanamerican school 
plan after its study found that fewer than 20 percent of the 5716 
black male students in milwaukee high schools had a grade average 
of c or better 
the group also found 50 percent of all students suspended from 
district schools last year were black males even though they make 
up only 276 percent of the total enrollment the districts high 
school dropout rate also stood at 144 percent last year the task 
force didnt study the rates for black female students 
leaders of milwaukees black community have supported the plan 
throughout its development saying the schools will be an 
alternative to traditional public education that has stressed 
european heritage 
a lot of africanamerican students male and female just 
dont have any sense of what we have gone through and come through 
as a people said alderman marvin pratt who represents a mostly 
black innercity district 
whats missing for a lot of young people is the pride in 
african history that i think an afrocentric curriculum will 
foster he said 
the approved proposal was modified from an earlier plan to 
establish three allblack allmale schools the earlier plan was 
scrapped after educators and lawyers advised it would be challenged 
as unconstitutional 
board member doris stacy opposed the proposal arguing its 
unconstitutional its educationally unsound its morally wrong 
to isolate students by race in america in 1990 is wrong 
ms stacy said the district needs to focus on black males but it 
would be better to create a program that incorporates a nurturing 
environment for all our children 
the poor performance of black students was cited in another 
educational experiment began this year the wisconsin legislature 
this spring approved a plan to provide 2500 vouchers to as many 
as 1000 poor milwaukee students allowing them to leave public 
schools for private nonsectarian schools 
the plan survived a court challenge and began this month with 
about 400 students enrolled in private schools

former east german secret police officers 
still hold top jobs in business while others have thwarted police 
investigations a parliamentary report said thursday 
there is the possibility that parts of the stasi apparatus are 
still functioning said joachim gauck head of the lawmakers 
commission overseeing the breakup of the secret police the secret 
police was known as the stasi 
east germans have become obsessed with the brutal legacy of the 
communist organization and have unmasked former members and 
collaborators 
west germanys ard television this week ran a documentary with 
interviews of east germans complaining that former secret police 
members still retain a grip on the nations factories 
almost daily new disclosures emerge about the stasi which had 
about 200000 members collaborators and informers before the 
government said it would disband 
of the 2448 elite stasi officers put in top positions 
throughout the country by the communists onehalf have been 
targeted for investigations said gauck chairman of the 
parliamentary commission 
the other half remains active especially in the nations 
businesses he told a news conference gauck is a member of the 
leftist party alliance 90 
east german companies are attempting to break free from 40 years 
of centrally planned communist administration to be transformed 
into capitalist enterprises 
there have been concerns that members of the old government 
especially former stasi members could try to disrupt the economic 
transition with west germany the merger between the two germanys 
is set for wednesday 
another parliamentary commission member jes moeller of the 
social democratic party said that former stasi members still on 
the job had hindered investigations into economic crimes 
in police offices the stasi officers are responsible for 
economic crimes and they have thrown out criminal complaints 
against managers of stasirun companies moeller said 
for months east germans have complained that the same people who 
were in key functions under the communists have stayed in those 
posts under the democratically elected government 
the masscirculation bild newspaper reported thursday that the 
stasi transferred about 100 million to the renamed communist 
party 
leaders of the party then distributed the money to numerous 
people apparently to keep it from being seized by investigators 
according to bild

the art institute of chicago hopes a free 
breakfast will go a long way toward steering visitors in its 
direction 
the museum treated about 100 taxi drivers to danish pastry 
juice coffee and a tour wednesday in the hope that the 
steeringwheel philosophers will talk up the place to their fares 
chicago taxi drivers really are roving ambassadors museum 
spokeswoman eileen harakal said not only do they answer 
passengers questions on chicagos attractions but they help steer 
people to them 
the art institutes current special exhibit from poussin to 
matisse the russian taste for french painting is sponsored by 
sara lee corp which provided the breakfast to cabbies and 
chauffeurs the museum waived the exhibits 6 entry fee and opened 
the show an hour early for the drivers 
its a great idea said cab driver bill hogan as he 
contemplated henri matisses still life with a blue tablecloth 
when people ask what there is to see in chicago i usually say the 
sears tower the museum of science and industry and the shedd 
aquarium now ill mention the art institute 
talk of taxi lease increases and rising gas prices intermingled 
with conversation about french art as the cabbies strolled past the 
exhibits 51 paintings 
cab drivers bring the art institute quite a bit of business 
said cabbie charles thomatis i always tell passengers how nice 
it is now ive got the chance to come in and take a peek for 
myself 
enjoyment of the paintings seemed to override worries about 
missed fares for some drivers 
youve got to take a little time out for yourself said 
cabbie bill davis drivers spend 1012 hours sitting behind the 
wheel of a cab so this is fantastic its one of the best things 
people have done for us 
not all taxi drivers were impressed 
if they really wanted to thank us they wouldve served 
breakfast at the curb john martins said they could have let 
us roll by pick up our coffee and doughnuts and go back to work

regulators learned thursday the government 
fund protecting bank accounts is dwindling faster than thought only 
two months ago and they voted a 1991 increase of more than 60 
percent on the deposit insurance premiums charged banks 
the federal deposit insurance corps bank fund dropped from 
132 billion at the end of last year to 114 billion at the end 
of june a 14 percent decline 
fdic chairman l william seidman said he now expects that by the 
end of the year the fund will have lost closer to 3 billion 
rather than the 2 billion he earlier predicted 
this is the result of an increased number of institutions 
being likely to fail and continued erosion in real estate 
markets seidman told members of a house panel in a meeting which 
followed the fdic vote to boost premiums 
if continuing bank failures were to exhaust the insurance fund 
congress and the bush administration would have to consider a 
taxpayer bailout as they have with the sampl insurance fund 
after receiving the new financial report the fivemember fdic 
board raised the insurance premium charged banks by more than 60 
percent 
banks in 1991 will pay 195 cents for every 100 in deposits up 
from 12 cents this year and 83 cents last year the higher rate 
will raise the funds premium income from 28 billion in 1990 to 
48 billion in 1991 
under last years sampl bailout law the premium had been 
scheduled to rise to 15 cents regulators began considering an 
added emergency increase after seidman told senators in july that 
the bank fund likely would suffer its third consecutive loss 
in midaugust they proposed the maximum increase allowed by law 
to 195 cents by comparison savings institutions pay a 23cent 
premium 
the bank funds 184 billion loss in the first six months of 
1990 has reduced the level of reserves in the fund to only 60 cents 
for every 100 of insured deposits the minimum considered safe is 
125 per 100 at the end of 1987 the level was 110 
sixty cents is the lowest point in the funds history and the 
congressional general accounting office has warned that if the 
economy dips into a recession the fund could be wiped out 
banks have a variety of options for absorbing higher premiums 
including charging savers higher fees and paying them less 
interest charging borrowers more for loans reducing dividends to 
stockholders or cutting payroll and other expenses 
undoubtedly some part of it will be passed along to bank 
customers but certainly all of it wont be passed along 
seidman told the house banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions 
the agencys staff calculated that if all of the difference 
between the 195cent assessment and the previously scheduled 
15cent assessment were passed to depositors the annual return on 
a 10000 deposit would decline by 450 
if the 195cent rate had been in effect last year instead of 
the 83cent rate and banks absorbed all of it 69 additional banks 
would have recorded losses instead of a profit and four more banks 
would have failed 
administrationbacked legislation that passed the house last 
week and is pending in the senate would give the fdic power to 
raise premiums as high as it decided was necessary 
if the legislation passes before congress adjourns next month 
seidman said his board would consider further premium increases 
with a 195cent premium the fund would not reach the minimum safe 
level until after 1995 he told the house panel 
however he warned that at some point forcing banks to pay more 
becomes counterproductive by weakening the industry 
rep frank annunzio dill has proposed assessing banks a 
onetime charge of 1 for every 100 in deposits raising 25 
billion for the insurance fund they would be expected to replenish 
the money as it is spent 
that seidman warned could drive 28 banks into insolvency and 
push 241 banks below minimum capital requirement 
rep jim leach riowa said regulators should force banks to 
raise more capital from investors or retain earnings as a buffer 
against losses regulators should threaten to remove senior bank 
management unless they raise capital he said 
one has to be a logical nincompoop to think that more premiums 
are a preferable route more premiums make the system weaker more 
capital makes the system stronger he said

the national science foundation is awarding 
86 million in grants to encourage middle schools and high schools 
to begin making sweeping changes in the way science is taught 
officials said thursday 
the grants represent the foundations largest single effort to 
reform precollege science education since the sputnik era of the 
1950s said luther williams assistant director for education and 
human resources 
the project wants to update teaching methods increase the time 
students spend on science and strengthen teacher training 
six threeyear grants were awarded from 12 proposals

coordinator of the project received 15 million baylor college 
of medicine 13 million the california department of education 
14 million the university of iowa 14 million the university 
of north carolina at wilmington 15 million and the university 
of puerto rico 14 million 
the education department funded 16 million of the earlier 
stages of the project 
the grant recipients will develop programs that will be tested 
in schools 
current science education follows a pattern in grades seven 
through nine life science in grade seven earth science in grade 
eight and another year of science in grade nine either life 
science or physical science said william aldridge executive 
director of the science teachers group

cake approach that teaches facts and terminology without relating 
the information to the students daily lives 
using the grants new science curriculum materials will be 
tested in regional middle and high schools national curriculum 
materials based on the regional materials then will be developed 
and distributed by the science teachers association

offered over three or four years instead of just one year which 
would lead to a more integrated high school science education

reform efforts of 214 high school and junior or middle schools 
across the state said tom sachse of the california education 
department a key focus will be on teacher training he said

the 78day standoff between mohawks and 
authorities in quebec left ill feelings that may not quickly fade 
but one positive offshoot was that it focused attention on the 
plight of canadas native tribes experts said thursday 
after the surrender of the last mohawk holdouts on wednesday 
federal and provincial governments were congratulating themselves 
for avoiding major violence and creating a new program designed to 
be more sensitive to indians 
meanwhile indians and other observers warn it wont take much 
for similar situations to erupt again 
the indians are starting to say that weve come down to the 
wire and we are going to hold the white man to his word said 
bruce clark a london ontario lawyer who has studied historical 
documents relating to indian relations with the government 
the white man talks about the rule of law as his great gift 
lets see if we can hold him to it he said 
georges erasmus grand chief of the assembly of first nations 
the national grouping of canadian indian bands said there is a 
tremendous onus now on the canadian government and the quebec 
government 
about 50 mohawks including women and children surrendered 
wednesday after being camped for nearly a month inside a drug and 
alcohol treatment center in oka 18 miles west of montreal they 
were taken to a nearby military base 
the withdrawal ended a conflict that began july 11 over plans by 
oka officials to expand a golf course onto land claimed by indians 
dozens of people were injured and one quebec police office was 
killed in clashes 
the golf course issue was settled early on when the federal 
government bought the disputed land and said it would turn it over 
to the mohawks but blockades set up at oka and kanawake south of 
montreal were joined by sympathy blockades by indian bands across 
the country 
most observers feel it was the public pressure and the 
continuing negative image of canadian officials that finally pushed 
prime minister brian mulroney on tuesday to announce his new 
program for dealing with natives 
he said the program would cover four points land claims the 
economic and social conditions on reserves the relationship 
between aboriginal peoples and governments and concerns of 
canadas aboriginal peoples in contemporary canadian life 
canadas aboriginal peoples deserve a special place in this 
country as our first citizens based on the aboriginal and treaty 
rights recognized in the constitution the prime minister said 
but he added i will be very clear on this point native 
selfgovernment does not now and cannot ever mean sovereign 
independence mohawk lands are a part of canadian territory and 
canadian law must and does apply 
that issue of law and jurisdiction are major issues between the 
government and many of the countrys native bands 
the situation is we do not have ordinary canadians here 
erasmus said referring to the oka crisis we have mohawk people 
that have been here for tens of thousands of years they have not 
ever voluntarily entered into a treaty that has extinguished their 
rights 
what is necessary is an understanding of how aboriginal 
rights treaty rights mesh with the civilian code in quebec and 
with canadian law 
there are about 450000 status or registered indians in 
canada and 33000 inuit often called eskimos these native people 
make up 593 bands on 2234 reserves covering 64 million acres 
for many reserve indians life is a continuous struggle against 
poverty alcoholism poor health services they also face lack of 
plumbing sewage disposal and drinking water death by injury or 
poisoning is quadruple that for the rest of canada life expectancy 
is nine years less than for a white canadian 
natives in general have a deep well of sympathy among white 
canadians but the indian struggles take place mostly in obscure 
camps and reserves far from the general population 
taking up arms cant help but come up again said attorney 
clark 
there are two solutions one is the rule of law the other is 
selfhelp we are at the point now where indians are tired of 
talking will violence happen again its almost a certainty that 
it will 
clark quotes from a royal proclamation of 1763 that guarantees 
the right of indians to selfgovernment he says that was 
reaffirmed in the 1982 constitution 
canadian history from that point took a very different road 
from that of the united states from that point the indians in 
canada laid down their arms there was no indian warfare 
either canada will honor its own constitutional law or it 
will have to change its constitutional law 
the natives say they have taken the government at its word that 
it will enter into serious negotiations with the indians now that 
the mohawks at oka have laid down their arms 
the end of the standoff is just the first step said ethel 
blondin an indian member of the house of commons the government 
must cough up what it appeared to promise 
the only way thats going to work is to move quickly

iran and britain announced thursday that 
they have restored relations the latest of several diplomatic 
successes for iran since neighboring iraq threatened the persian 
gulf with its invasion of kuwait 
london and tehran had severed diplomatic ties following 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis call in february 1989 to kill british 
author salman rushdie whose novel the satanic verses 
infuriated moslems worldwide 
the restoration raised modest hopes of freedom for british 
hostages held by proiranian extremists in lebanon but left 
unresolved the dispute over rushdie who has been in hiding since 
khomeinis death call 
the announcement at the united nations by british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd and in a statement from irans un mission 
said the embassies would reopen in london and tehran within a 
month 
hurd retreated into heavy diplomatic parlance when asked about 
rushdie 
it is our understanding from public statements made by iranian 
officials that the iranian government respects the law and would 
not interfere in the internal affairs of any other country 
anymore than the united kingdom would 
that was taken as an assurance that iran would not try to send 
assassins after rushdie who is believed to still be in britain 
hurd said the other outstanding issues between the two 
countries including the british hostages held in lebanon by 
islamic fundamentalists loyal to irans shiite revolution are 
better discussed at the full diplomatic level 
hurd also praised iran for voting for un embargoes against 
iraq despite improving relations between iran and its former emeny 
in washington the state department said it had no comment on 
britishiranian announcement thats between them department 
spokesman richard boucher said 
the iranian statement gave no the reason for the restoration of 
relations saying only that it was based on mutual respect 
in the past six weeks iran has gained land peace money and 
some respect benefiting at least in part from the changing 
alignment of the middle east following iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 
iraq facing a usled multinational force in saudi arabia and 
the gulf caved into iranian demands to seek a formal end to the 
198088 iraniraq war the two sides exchanged prisoners of war 
freed hundreds of thousands of troops from their border and agreed 
this month to resume diplomatic relations 
iraq also withdrew from iranian territory occupied during the 
war and agreed to share sovereignty over a disputed waterway 
western nations meanwhile have sought closer relations with 
iran whose more than 700mile border with iraq makes iranian 
support critical to un trade sanctions on iraq iran has said it 
will honor the trade embargo 
on sept 21 the united states paid a 200 milliion claim for 
undelivered american equipment orders dating from before the 1979 
islamic revolution it was the largest claim before a tribunal 
settling billions in iranian assets frozen by the united states 
iran has recently been less hostile to the west and iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani is seeking western ties and aid to 
rebuild iran following the war 
in february 1989 khomeini issued the death threat against 
rushdie saying his novel blasphemed islam 
iranian officials did not terminate the threat when khomeini 
died in june 1989 they had demanded that britain condemn the book 
as a condition to restoring relations british prime minister 
margaret thatchers government did not do so but it acknowledged 
that parts of the satanic verses might be considered insulting 
to moslems 
rushdie who was born in india is a british citizen 
the resumption of relations raised hopes tehran might now work 
for securing the release of the british hostages held in lebanon 
the resumption of ties also raised speculation that roger 
cooper a british businessman imprisoned in iran since 1985 on 
espionage charges may be freed 
iranian authorities have said cooper 54 has been tried and 
convicted but the sentence has never been made public 
british officials had cited coopers ordeal and that of the 
hostages in lebanon as major obstacles in resumption of 
londontehran ties 
there have been increasing signs from tehran that it is 
searching for an end to the hostage issue it admitted in april 
that it helped free two americans frank reed and robert polhill 
and president bushs administration publicly thanked iran 
last month tehran also was said to have played a major role in 
securing the release of irishman brian keenan a native of belfast 
who also carried a british passport 
the four british hostages are among the 13 westerners believed 
held most by captors loyal to iran they are church of england

a surrogate mother who gave birth to a 
baby created by another couples sperm and egg was limited thursday 
to two visits a week with the child who is living for the time 
being with his genetic parents superior court judge richard 
parslow cut birth mother anna johnsons daily visits to twice a 
week after hearing testimony from the infants courtappointed 
guardian william steiner that tension between ms johnson and the 
genetic parents was detrimental to the baby 
parslow also followed steiners recommendation that the baby 
remain in the custody of genetic parents mark and crispina calvert 
at least until a parental rights hearing oct 9 
i think it would be in the best interest of the child to 
remain with the calverts steiner said 
ms johnson 29 sued last august for custody of the child 
attorneys in the case have called it unprecedented because ms 
johnson is seeking custody of a child to whom she has no genetic 
link in the muchpublicized baby m case in new jersey the 
surrogate mother was also the babys genetic mother 
ms johnson who worked with mrs calvert at a santa ana 
hospital was hired by the couple for 10000 to bear their 
testtube baby mrs calvert 36 was medically unable to carry a 
child although she could produce ova 
the surrogate sued for custody child support and damages on 
aug 13 alleging the couple failed to provide agreedupon 
financial and emotional support after supposedly losing interest in 
the pregnancy 
attorney richard gilbert representing ms johnson argued 
thursday that his client should be allowed to continue seeing the 
child each day ms johnson did not attend the hearing 
gilbert maintains the baby belongs with ms johnson because she 
was the birth mother the calverts are seeking custody because it 
was the embryo from their egg and sperm that was implanted in ms 
johnson 
the baby born sept 19 was discharged from st joseph hospital 
in orange on saturday and given to the calverts 
technically the baby is still unnamed but ms johnson calls 
him matthew and the calverts call him michael christopher 
last friday parslow awarded temporary custody of the baby to 
the calverts the judge was going to send the baby to a foster home 
because attorneys for the couple and the surrogate were unable to 
agree on interim custody but ms johnson rejected the foster home 
idea

iraqi president saddam husseins security 
shield is so thick and mobile that the only way hell be toppled is 
if one of his intimate advisers turns against him us officials 
said thursday 
based on reports from iraq the officials said theyve concluded 
that saddam remains in baghdad but moves around frequently from his 
various palaces in the capital 
the officials spoke on condition they remain anonymous 
he is moving around a lot one official said saddams 
houses are welldefended and structurally strong and he is 
taken from place to place usually in a heavily secured convoy 
saddams whereabouts and his habits have been somewhat of a 
mystery since he ordered his troops to invade kuwait on aug 2 
before the invasion saddam was a visible leader making 
frequent public appearances at mosques and schools but he has been 
in virtual seclusion since the invasion apparently because he 
fears for his safety his pronouncements are usually by his 
spokesman on television 
saddam is alive well and breathing said an official 
various visitors have seen him recently including the mooccan 
foreign minister and palestinian officials 
but saddam who has been the target of 11 assassination attempts 
in the last 13 years apparently only deals facetoface with a 
handful of close advisers 
among them are taha yasin ramadan the first deputy prime 
minister and latif nasuayyif jasim the minister of culture and 
information 
were saddam to be assassinated the plotters would have to be 
senior enough to get through the security the official said 
it would have to happen very fast they would have to go 
directly to saddam 
but the officials said the top advisers keep each other in 
sight to ensure none of them disappears 
they know if one is missing what that means the official 
said 
saddam has a history of ruthlessness he once shot to death a 
health minister who disagreed with him 
he doesnt allow a whiff of opposition an official said 
saddams security apparatus is awesome it is comprised of 
various forces many of them controlled by saddams relatives he 
also has the elite revolutionary guards numbering about 100000 
the officials said they believe saddams conspiratorial 
tendencies have been heightened by the gulf crisis 
he is obviously spending a lot of time thinking about his 
security one official said 
at the same time government officials are unsure how saddam is 
filtering information he receives from the west their assessment 
is that hes prepared for what he sees as an inevitable battle 
over kuwait but is unwilling to provoke war 
despite the hardships he has inflicted on his country internal 
opposition to saddam remains limited the officials said 
dissidents either dont exist or they have been silenced through 
death or exile 
the kurds a mountain people who seek independence from iraq 
were brought to heel when the iraqis resettled thousands of them in 
a desert area and used chemical gas against others 
there have been unconfirmed reports us intelligence is helping 
the kurds but us officials said any antisaddam sentiment had 
been hushed 
we dont see any signs of dissidents said an official 
the officials also cautioned against underestimating saddams 
appeal to his people 
he is not unpopular said the official noting that the 
iraqi president has managed to improve his peoples standard of 
living feed them and instill in them a sense of national pride 
he is not a ceausescu the official said referring to 
nicolae ceausescu the romanian president who was executed in 
december after being toppled

a deranged iranian gunman with a 
hatred of blond americans died in a burst of police bullets 
thursday seven hours after he stormed a bar killed one man 
wounded seven people and took 33 hostages 
six officers stormed henrys publick house and grille in the 
durant hotel after police negotiators decided they couldnt talk 
the gunman out of the bar said lt jim polk 
we decided there was no other way said polk 
he said the gunman identified by university of california 
berkeley spokesman ray colvig as mehrdad dashti gave away his 
position inside the bar by using one of the terrorized hostages as 
an intermediary in talking to police by telephone 
every time the hostage would have to ask a question of this 
bad guy he would have to turn around and look at him and this gave 
us a good idea of where he was said polk 
seconds after the burst of police gunfire around 720 am 
hostages some of whom had been forced to sit in the windows of the 
bar as shields ran from the hotel 
dashti 30 a native of iran was naked and bleeding when he was 
loaded into an ambulance and taken to highland hospital he was 
dead on arrival according to hospital spokeswomen phyllis brown 
he was apparently very confused said berkeley police capt 
phil doran deranged is not a bad description 
for some reason he had something against blonds caucasian 
women and blondhaired blueeyed men said douglas moore 25 a 
uc student and manager of the bar who was one of the hostages he 
had something against americans 
he accused the women of showing too much leg moore said 
he accused them of wearing tight skirts short skirts 
he said it was that kind of trash that was leading guys like 
him on and that they deserved to be punished he did a pretty 
good job of degrading the women 
mayor loni hancock said women hostages were sexually abused but 
wouldnt give details 
moore however said no one was sexually abused 
moore said dashti claimed the government owed him 16 trillion 
for mental telepathy work and this was his way of getting it 
back 
san francisco police sgt jerry senkir said dashti was named in 
a warrant charging grand theft in connection with cashing two 
stolen checks worth more than 16000 he said dashti had been 
advised of the charges and police expected him to turn himself in 
one of dashtis demands was that san francisco police chief 
frank jordan appear live on television and drop his drawers 
according to doran 
doran said one of dashtis complaints was that he didnt get a 
student loan 
the english pubstyle bar a popular student hangout one block 
from the uc campus was crowded when the gunman rushed inside 
witnesses said several escaped soon after the standoff began 
police said 
dashti shot six people after entering said doran police 
reported another two people were shot during another round of 
gunfire about three hours later 
moore said john sheehy 22 of lafayette was shot in the chest 
at close range early in the incident sheehy a uc student died 
during surgery said thomas mcgarry a spokesman at eden hospital 
in castro valley 
witnesses said the shooting was punctuated by the gunman 
screaming when is it going to end how long how long 
frederick smith 19 a uc junior from los angeles and dashtis 
roommate for a month said dashti grew up in iran and moved to this 
country about eight years ago he said dashti was a gun collector 
and had given smith shooting lessons 
smith said dashti told him wednesday that smith would have to 
move out because dashti was flying to hawaii to meet a woman his 
parents had arranged for him to marry 
smith said dashti had earned an engineering degree from san 
francisco state university but couldnt find a job 
the apartment they shared was cluttered with family photographs 
ammunition drab furniture and bookshelves crowded with books one 
document found in the apartment a form from the alameda county 
department of health services described him as a paranoid 
schizophrenic 
two of the wounded were in guarded condition with multiple 
bullet wounds two were being treated for leg wounds and three 
were treated and released hospital officials said

miles southsouthwest of here said lt cmdr sandy stairs a 
spokeswoman for the us pacific fleet 
the 31foot submarine sea cliff videotaped the 6by10foot 
piece on the ocean floor and brought it to the surface with its 
hydraulic jaws stairs said it was brought onto the deck of the 
navy vessel the laney choust at about midnight wednesday 
during the 18hour dive wednesday the submarines threeman 
crew believed it also found the upper half of the cargo door about 
200 yards away from where the lower half was found stairs said the 
submarine planned to dive again thursday night to examine the 
debris which was spotted as a strong sonar contact 
the national transportation safety board called for the search 
in hopes that examining the door will lead to better aviation 
safety rules 
in washington the safety board said a preliminary examination 
by one of its investigators showed the door had fractured 
longitudinally near the midspan latch the eight sectors of the 
latch lock were all in the locked position and were deformed 
after investigators examine the recovered debris parts of it 
will be sent to the boeing co in seattle for a more detailed 
review under board direction ntsb officials said 
if the submarine is able to retrieve the top half of the door 
the sea cliff and its support ship are expected to return to pearl 
harbor late friday or early saturday 
the jumbo jet carried 355 passengers when it took off for new 
zealand on feb 24 1989 
shortly after takeoff the cargo door opened at 22000 feet 
nine passengers were swept out of the plane and five others 
suffered serious injuries the crew managed to return the jet to 
honolulu 
the ntsb inquiry determined that faulty design of a locking 
mechanism probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the 
door was locked 
the agency blamed united boeing and the federal aviation 
administration for failing to correct problems with the door 
debris from the jet was located in july by a sonarscanning sled 
that can spot metallic objects over wide areas 
markings on debris found on several dives indicate it is from a 
boeing 747 stairs said 
she said the debris also included pieces of fuselage and window 
frames with 747 written on them

a house subcommittee chairman moved thursday 
to allow a tripling of president bushs first oil sale from the 
governments strategic petroleum reserve 
the move came after energy secretary james watkins said the 
planned 5millionbarrel sale would have no significant effect on 
gasoline prices 
bush ordered the test sale wednesday with his spokesman saying 
it was intended in part as a signal to quell speculation in the 
oil markets and halt skyrocketing crude prices 
on thursday however prices shot up briefly to above 40 a 
barrel for the first time on the new york mercantile exchange 
watkins meanwhile told the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on energy and power that the administration has no 
expectation that it the sale is going to have any significant 
longterm market impact 
but were not going into this test with the idea that its 
going to bring the cost down 8 a barrel or something he said 
thats not the purpose if saddam hussein makes another threat 
the market could jump again regardless of the test sale 
watkins told the panel the 5 million barrel test sale which was 
authorized by congress two weeks ago was too small to indicate how 
the governments 590millionbarrel stockpile might fit into the 
world oil market if bush should decide to order an actual emergency 
drawdown 
this is not a drawdown he emphasized adding that the test 
will give us optimum readiness to open the spigot if that is 
required in the future 
recalling that the administration just two weeks ago threatened 
to veto a larger test sale rep phil sharp dind and the 
subcommittee chairman asked watkins how large a test he would 
like 
three times the 5 million number is the number watkins 
replied 
we welcome the change said sharp who had his staff draft a 
bill authorizing a new test sale of 15 million barrels and gather 
the signatures of several other committee members on it while 
watkins was testifying anticipating no opposition in the senate 
sharp said the bill could be on bushs desk for his signature in 
two week 
bid notices on the 5 million barrel test will be sent out 
friday the energy department expects to award sale contracts in 
midoctober 
bob porter a department spokesman said an average of 167000 
barrels of oil far short of the 500000 barrels that analysts say 
is needed to drive prices down will be released daily for 30 
days 
lawmakers including senate gop leader bob dole of kansas urged 
bush for more than a month to tap the reserve to stem the runup in 
oil prices since iraqs takeover of kuwait aug 2 and the 
subsequent embargo removing about 43 million barrels daily from 
the world market 
watkins said thursday that us crude stocks are above normal 
as of the moment but they could go below normal by the end of 
october 
we are concerned about the ability of refiners to continue 
operating as they have been at nearmaximum capacity with our 
system so fully utilized we are more vulnerable to accidents 
transportation problems or bad weather 
the us stockpile stored in salt caverns along the 
louisianatexas coast is capable of pumping up to 35 million 
barrels a day 
the white house meanwhile shrugged off the fact that oil 
prices rose thursday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater with bush in cleveland 
for a republican fundraising speech said driving down world oil 
prices was not bushs purpose for taking the action 
in the presidents mind it was the unfairness issue 
fitzwater said 
on wednesday the spokesman said he expected lower prices would 
be one effect of the presidents action he would not repeat that 
characterization thursday

natural gas embargo imposed by president mikhail gorbachev in may

two infertility clinics charged by the federal 
trade commission with misrepresenting success rates have agreed not 
to make such claims in the future the ftc announced thursday 
one of the clinics ivf australia one of the largest providers 
of fertility services in the united states said its claims were 
not inaccurate but may have been hard to understand 
we have always provided the public with accurate 
information said vicki baldwin a founding director of the firm 
in a news release issued from its headquarters in greenwich conn 
we do agree that some prospective patients may have found our 
success rate reports difficult to interpret ms baldwin said 
thus in cooperation with the federal trade commission we have 
revised our materials to improve clarity 
the cases involve in vitro fertilization ivf services in 
which the sperm and the egg are joined together in the laboratory 
instead of naturally in the womb of the mother 
ivf australia offers medical services at united hospital port 
chester ny waltham weston hospital and medical center in 
waltham mass and at a clinic in mineola ny 
the other clinic involved is the west boca medical center in 
boca raton fla 
sid tyler executive vice president of nme hospital group in 
santa monica calif operator of the florida clinic said we 
dont agree completely with the ftc on this but nonetheless we 
have agreed with the consent order and we are certainly going to 
comply with the request that they have made that any statistical 
comparisons or statistical claims that we make are done 
comparably to similar national data so that we are talking about 
apples and apples 
the ftc invited public comment on the consent agreements with 
the clinics and noted that the allegations do not concern the 
quality of the services provided 
these two cases will provide important guidance to a growing 
industry about the support necessary to make valid success rate 
claims gloria cordes larson deputy director of the commissions 
bureau of consumer protection said 
the commission said infertility affects one in six us couples 
ivf australia advertised in newspapers and magazines that more 
than 28 percent of the couples who complete a cycle of treatment 
are becoming pregnant and that one out of three couples who 
complete a cycle of treatment is becoming pregnant 
a brochure sent to prospective patients said our experience 
indicates that when a patient at an ivf australia program completes 
four ivf treatment cycles the chance of giving birth is about 50 
percent 
the ftc said these claims misled consumers by overstating the 
likelihood of achieving either a live birth or a pregnancy it said 
a significant number of unsuccessful outcomes were excluded from 
the calculation used to determine success 
the consent order requires ivf australia to include in its 
calculations all patients who begin the program 
the complaint against the boca raton clinic charges that it 
advertised in local newspapers and national magazines that four 
of our first 12 patients participating in our in vitro 
fertilization program have achieved pregnancy and that our 
success rate is an impressive 30 percent well above the national 
average 
it said these determinations were based entirely on a chemical 
test which should have been subjected to confirmation by an 
ultrasound or sonogram test and was not 
the commission said its order provided that in making future 
claims the clinic must use the same tests that the other success 
rates use 
the agreement are open for public comment for 60 days after 
which the commission will decide whether to make them final 
final consent orders do not involve admission of a law violation 
but carry the force of law with respect to future actions each 
violation of such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to 
10000

the irancontra special prosecutor indicated 
thursday that he may seek more indictments but expressed 
determination to conclude the investigation by next spring 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said his office is 
reviewing recently obtained records of the irancontra affair and 
questioning previously unavailable witnesses as prosecutors work to 
conclude the nearly fouryearold investigation 
in remarks prepared for delivery thursday in topeka kan walsh 
said he would not make a decision about closing down his office 
until after an appeals court reviews the convictions of former 
national security adviser john m poindexter 
poindexter is appealing his sixmonth sentence for obstructing 
congressional inquiries about covert military aid to nicaraguan 
rebels and the sale of arms to iran a decision on poindexters 
appeal of five felony convictions is not expected until spring 
ideally the work of the office except for possible appeals 
and the trial of any outstanding indictments should be concluded 
after this decision walsh said 
during the intervening months our investigation should be 
completed walsh said in the speech at washburn university 
walshs remarks indicated that his original timetable for 
closing down the investigation had slipped at least six more 
months 
following poindexters conviction in april walsh said he hoped 
to decide by this fall on whether to conclude the investigation 
since his appointment in late 1986 walsh has obtained eight 
convictions of irancontra figures including poindexter and former 
white house aide oliver l north 
in his speech walsh held out the possibility of more 
indictments from a grand jury that sources say is continuing to 
investigate the role of reagan administration officials in covering 
up the affair 
but walsh said his efforts will be largely focused on defending 
the convictions of north and poindexter in appellate courts 
norths convictions were set aside in july by a federal appeals 
court panel that ordered a hearing to determine if references to 
testimony that he gave congress under a grant of immunity seeped 
into his trial 
walsh is asking the appellate court to reconsider its decision 
poindexter who also testified before congress under a limited 
immunity grant is expected to raise the same issues on his appeal 
of a sixmonth sentence for obstructing congressional inquiries and 
lying to lawmakers about covert military aid to the nicaraguan 
contras and the sale of arms to iran 
with the sept 18 taxevasion conviction of thomas clines a 
former cia agent who helped broker usiran arms sales walsh has 
no pending indictments to prepare for trial 
all of our efforts can be devoted to pending appeals and 
remaining areas of investigation walsh said even at this late 
date some records have only recently come into our possession 
walsh did not describe the records or identify previously 
unavailable witnesses who are now being questioned but he appeared 
to be referring to north and poindexter who have both appeared as 
witnesses before the grand jury that meets periodically to take 
testimony 
as court proceedings are being concluded our remaining 
investigation will be completed walsh said if there should be 
further prosecutions they will be pressed without delay 
the continuing expense of the investigation which has cost more 
than 21 million must also be considered in connection with any 
extension of activities 
the prosecutor blamed delays in his investigation on the 
decision by congress to force poindexter and north to testify under 
immunity grants that barred prosecutors from using theirtestimony 
as evidence 
the grants doubled the time taken from indictment to final 
disposition because it forced the court to try north and 
poindexter separately walsh said

rep bruce vento of the house banking 
committee introduced legislation thursday designed to outlaw a 
republican fundraising tactic he says is deceptive 
earlier this year the national republican senatorial committee 
sent 25 checks to a million prospective contributors fine print 
on the back of the checks if they are endorsed authorizes the gop 
committee to deduct 1250 a month from recipients checking 
accounts 
ventos account fraud and deception prevention act would amend 
the electronic fund transfer act to ensure that the endorsement 
cashing or deposit of a check cannot be used to authorize automatic 
withdrawals from a checking account 
if left unchecked this new baitandhook gimmick will become 
the scam artist dream of the 90s vento dminn said in a 
statement 
democratic attorneys general in alabama and illinois have filed 
suit to stop the republican committees solicitation republican 
attorneys general in wisconsin and oregon and the democratic 
attorney general in minnesota have said they were investigating the 
tactic 
wendy burnley a spokeswoman for the republic committee had no 
comment on the bill but she said the fundraising letter 
accompanying the checks clearly explained that endorsing them would 
authorize automatic withdrawals 
she said that only the first two withdrawals were mandatory and 
that further withdrawals could be stopped at any time and that a 
full refund could be obtained by calling a tollfree number 
provided in the letter 
however some recipients have complained that they did not 
realize they were authorizing deductions 
vento said he hoped to move the bill which has six democratic 
cosponsors before congress adjourns next month 
it is imperative that we close the door before any more bogus 
checks are foisted on the american people he said 
burnley said the republican committee has agreed to meet with 
state officials objecting to the solicitations but not until after 
the election 
there are some places where this has become highly 
politicized she said

police on thursday defused a bomb planted in a 
lunch box that had been taped to a lectern at a conference on 
terrorism in central london 
commander george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards 
antiterrorist squad said the device contained enough plastic 
explosives to kill and was probably put there by the irish 
republican army 
but no group immediately claimed responsibility for the bomb 
found in the royal overseas league building on park place in the 
piccadilly section in the center of london 
a sound engineer checking the public address system before the 
start of the conference found a plastic lunch box taped to the 
lectern at 930 am police and television crews covering the 
conference said 
antiterrorist squad officers defused the bomb which was 
scheduled to go off an hour later police said the conference was 
to have begun 30 minutes earlier at 10 am 
foreign office minister william waldegrave was to have been the 
first speaker but a change in his appointments forced a 
lastminute schedule switch and he was moved back to 330 pm 
churchillcoleman said he did not believe that waldegrave or 
metropolitan police commissioner sir peter imbert also scheduled 
to speak at the oneday conference organized by the research 
institute for the study of conflict and terrorism were the 
targets 
the conference which was widely advertised would be seen as 
a legitimate target by irish republican terrorist groups he 
said 
scotland yard said police had found nothing in a comprehensive 
search of the building at 6 am 
independent television news sound engineer pat hillyard said he 
noticed the conference sound engineer trying to fit the top on the 
lectern 
he found out that what was stopping him from fixing the top of 
the lectern was the package hillyard said they looked at it 
and asked if anybody was responsible for putting it inside we said 
it was nothing to do with us 
they realized quickly that it was something suspect and got us 
out quickly within a minute hillyard said 
the building and others nearby were evacuated the conference 
abandoned and police closed off busy central london streets while 
they searched for a second device 
churchillcoleman said it was a sophisticated terrorist device 
that would have been activated by a timer 
it did contain sufficient high explosive that had the device 
exploded which we believe would have been about 1030 this 
morning it would have caused death and serious injury 
it would have killed the speaker and other people as well 
he said 
the ira has targeted government officials and security forces in 
its fight to end british rule in northern ireland 
professor richard shultz of tufts university in boston who was 
scheduled to address the conference on american views of terrorism 
said there had been an embarrassing security lapse 
i am not happy with this but if someone got through it was a 
fairly sophisticated move because there were a lot of people 
around shultz said

pound the kettle drums and sound a fanfare the 
worldrenowned chicago symphony orchestra is opening its 100th 
season as director and grammy king sir georg solti begins his 
triumphant farewell 
thursdays seasonopening performance at orchestra hall begins a 
year of programs featuring some of the orchestras greatest 
triumphs 
included will be paul duakas the sorcerers apprentice 
which chicago introduced to this country in 1899 it was 
incorporated 40 years later into the soundtrack of the disney film 
classic fantasia 
solti winner of a record 29 grammy awards 23 for chicago 
symphony recordings and six for other works will retire next fall 
after 22 seasons with the orchestra daniel barenboim was named two 
years ago as his eventual successor although solti will return as 
a guest conductor at least once a year 
the 77yearold maestro told a news conference thursday it is 
wonderfully appropriate that his final year as conductor is 
also the orchestras centennial 
if you have to leave your family this is the moment to leave 
it in solti said in his thick hungarian accent 
after more than two decades of globetrotting with the 
orchestra solti said what probably pleases me more than 
anything else is that we have never had any major disagreements i 
never had to raise my voice 
solti who took over in 1968 said he selected 66 of the 
orchestras 105 musicians by that measure it truly is soltis 
band 
but the chicago symphony orchestra also belongs to the world 
critics rank it among the worlds finest and its recordings with 
solti are consistently bestsellers in the classical category 
in the early years under solti the orchestra was still the butt 
of chicago gangster jokes were those really violins in their 
instrument cases 
but the orchestra may be best known today for its virtuoso 
performances of gustav mahlers long wideranging symphonies 
thursdays program included mahlers symphony no 5 which was 
both the first piece the soltiled orchestra performed at carnegie 
hall in 1970 and the first symphony they recorded together 
i suppose it became a hit using this nice american slang 
solti said he said its inclusion would make the openingnight 
performance a very sentimental occasion 
david stearns classical music critic for usa today said the 
orchestra means mahler to many but that its trademark is its 
versatility 
under solti its like a big gleaming rollsroyce polished 
within an inch of its life its aggressive its commanding 
stearns said in a telephone interview from new york city under 
barenboim its softer and more voluptuous because thats 
barenboims style 
and always stearns said the orchestra is unfailingly 
professional there is a certain standard under which they will 
not fall 
solti said he told his musicians much the same thing when 
rehearsals for the centennial season began in the summer 
i told them that what distinguishes you above all orchestras 
is the spirit of the music you make under any circumstances that 
distinguishes you above all others

president bush monitored budget negotiations 
from afar on thursday as he repeated to republican fundraising 
audiences a message not usually heard from incumbent politicians 
how bad things could get 
bush has been painting a nightmarish picture of what will happen 
to government services beginning monday in the absence of a budget 
agreement as he winds up a tour that is raising 4 million for 
republican candidates in ohio minnesota illinois and michigan 
no matter that bush himself who convened the socalled budget 
summit last spring is far from the bargaining table he has been 
blaming democrats for the failure to move the talks along 
he also suggests that when his presence is needed hell join 
the talks 
at a cleveland luncheon for gop gubernatorial candidate george 
voinovich bush said automatic budget cuts would mean an end to 
federal cleanup of toxic waste sites 
later at a detroit fundraiser bush said that in michigan the 
social security office will be closed on friday and 
investigations of white collar criminals will drop by 25 
percent 
congress has got to stop beign manicdepressive he added in 
prepared remarks manic on spending depressive for the 
economy 
earlier thursday he told a minneapolis breakfast for gop 
gubernatorial candidate jon grunseth that many of minnesotas 
spectacular parks would close and there would be head start 
teachers who cant go to work 
and bush said there may be senior citizens wondering why 
their social security checks are late 
the night before in chicago he raised every travelers worst 
fears the specter of untold hours of flight delays at busy 
ohare airport 
and in akron ohio he told an audience that under budget cuts 
poor kids would not be able to attend akron university 
four days from now the fiscal year ends and still no budget 
agreement bush told his cleveland audience calling the impasse 
in washington a fiscal fiasco 
the last thing the nation needs he added is a budget 
breakdown that puts them on the road to recession 
administration officials said privately that a budget accord

rodney dangerfield was awarded 725000 on 
thursday by jury that believed the comedians eye problems were 
caused by a steam bath accident at caesars palace 
dangerfield sued the casinohotel for 5 million after caesars 
balked at paying him for shows he missed after he claimed he was 
burned in a steam bath in march 1988 
we showed rodney some respect an unidentified juror said 
after dangerfield thanked jurors as they left us district court 
the jury deliberated less than a day before awarding dangerfield 
225000 for five missed performances and 500000 for pain and 
suffering 
the jury ruled that dangerfields contract obligated caesars to 
pay for the missed shows because the injury should have excused him 
from performing it rejected a 100000 countersuit filed by 
caesars against its former headliner 
the truth won out said dangerfield he decried as 
nonsense and untrue caesars accusations that he used drugs 
im surprised they went to that level to degrade me falsely 
like they did dangerfield said all they did in this entire 
trial was to try to degrade my character 
i wasnt concerned with the amount of money he said 
money is money i was concerned about the truth i was right i 
wouldnt have gone through this unless i was right 
dangerfield said henry gluck chairman of the resorts parent 
caesars world inc had refused an offer to settle for 225000 
were very disappointed said bruce aguilera attorney for 
the casino well have to have our lawyers look at the case 
dangerfield sought 5 million in damages plus 45000 for each 
show he missed the week of the accident claiming caesars was 
negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath 
the hotel in its countersuit accused dangerfield of breaching 
his contract and contended during the 2weeklong trial that the 
comedian did not suffer permanent damage 
the 68yearold comic testified he was hit in the eyes by a 
burst of steam as he opened the door to the steam room on march 16 
1988 
he skipped four performances then returned for two shows but 
walked off the stage without performing on closing night because he 
was angry that caesars wanted to withhold payment for the missed 
shows 
caesars claimed dangerfield went out on the town two nights that 
he claimed he was too hurt to perform a doctor who examined him 
after the incident said that dangerfield could have performed 
other eye specialists testified for the casinohotel that symptoms 
dangerfield claimed to suffer only since the accident actually 
first appeared in the 1970s 
however an eye doctor who has examined dangerfield three times 
in the last year testified that he continues to suffer pain from 
the steam injury

a mexican teenager flew home thursday with a 
new face and a mickey mouse cap to replace the ski mask he wore to 
hide his disfigurement 
he came in with a mask covering him completely hes going out 
in a baseball cap said dr mutaz habal the plastic surgeon who 
last month built a new skull and half a face for 18yearold pablo 
hernandezpina 
pablo does not look like an animal he is human now said 
his mother severiana hernandezpina 
the young man was so badly deformed said habal that he had his 
doubts that he could help him when he heard of the case 18 months 
ago congenital birth defects left hernandezpina with a severely 
disfigured face and cleft palate 
he was what you call a monstrosity the doctor said you 
could see how he frightened people the first time i looked at him 
i thought it was probably almost impossible to do 
when hernandezpina arrived in tampa on aug 12 he couldnt 
close his mouth or eat solid food he had no nose his right eye 
socket was just above his ear a large hole in the bone of his 
forehead left his brain protected only by a flap of wrinkled skin 
in a 15hour operation at st josephs hospital habal and his 
team of surgeons cut the teens scalp from just above one ear to 
the top of the other and pulled his face down like a mask 
surgeons then moved his right eye socket to the front of his 
face and built a nose they closed a large hole in his skull and 
shifted his brain from the oral cavity back into his head a 
section of skull was used to build the teens forehead and two ribs 
were made into cheekbones 
after the operation hernandezpina who had lived only on 
goats milk tasted his first solid food chicken eggs cookies 
chocolate spaghetti and french fries 
i liked all of it the shy slight youngster said through an 
interpreter at habals office where he had a final examination 
before boarding a flight for central mexico the family lives on a 
farm in apaseol ginade village in guanajuato province 
the young man still has a lot of work ahead said his doctor 
his face is swollen from where the skin was moved he must learn to 
wear an artificial eye and he has been fitted with braces to 
straighten his teeth more surgery may also be needed 
but hospital officials say his outlook on life has already 
changed for the better 
i saw him go from total withdrawal to absolute excitement 
after the bandages came off said karen parker director of 
surgical services at st josephs he went from following behind 
in his mothers shadows with a mask on to running ahead of her

the soviet union on thursday became a member of 
the international police agency interpol the official news agency 
tass said 
in a onesentence report from ottawa tass said at a session 
of the interpol general assembly that opened here on thursday the 
soviet union became a member of this organization uniting more than 
150 countries 
but interpol secretarygeneral raymond kendall was quoted by 
canadian press as saying the soviets had applied to join interpol 
and never in history has an applicant been refused membership 
kendall made his remarks at thursdays opening of the 59th 
general assembly of interpol where a soviet delegation is 
attending 
by the end of the year all these countries in eastern 
europe will be in kendall added 
czechoslovakia and poland which have emerged over the last year 
from communist rule as new democracies are joining this year he 
said 
yugoslavia a communist country not considered part of the 
soviet bloc is an interpol member though kendall said much of 
eastern europe has been an empty space on the map for us 
would soviet membership make a difference in the international 
battle with crime 
oh yes kendall said mentioning as an example possible drug 
routes through countries in which interpol has had little previous 
contact with police 
about 500 delegates from 150 countries were present for the 
opening speech by prime minister brian mulroney but absent was 
kuwait which was invaded aug 2 and annexed by iraq 
kendall said kuwait had told interpol it would attend the 
meeting but an aide was unable to say whether kuwaits reply to 
the invitation had come before or the invasion 
both kuwait and iraq are interpol members 
delegations were seated alphabetically with iraqs faisal 
hussein ministercounselor at the iraq embassy here next to the 
iranian delegates the israeli members were nearby 
asked how he felt about kuwaits possible attendance hussein 
said so what 
in his speech mulroney made only a brief reference to attacks 
on kuwait by a neighboring country and focused on the 
international flavor of the meeting 
the hopeful symbols of our new age are compelling he said 
the iron curtain is in tatters germany is uniting the two 
koreas are talking the united nations is working 
and right here in ottawa the soviet union czechoslovakia and 
poland in another symbol of this new age are adhering to the 
constitution of interpol 
despite all this crime still posed problems 
crime is going global mulroney said if interpol did not 
exist it would have to be invented 
interpol extends the long arm of the law around the globe

congress approved a bill thursday offering 
money and an apology to the socalled victims of the cold war 
in some western states who may have developed cancer from nuclear 
bomb testing or uranium mining 
the bill approved on voice vote by the house and sent to the 
president is an admission that the government was wrong to test 
nuclear weapons above ground in nevada while people were living in 
fallout areas downwind said rep barney frank dmass who led 
debate for the measure 
it also recognizes the governments liability in allowing people 
to mine uranium for nuclear weapons without protective gear he 
said 
american citizens going about their business were exposed to 
radiation in degrees we would not allow now said frank miners 
sent into the mines without even the slightest protection against 
the material they were being asked to mine 
the bill authorizes 10 million for a radiation exposure trust 
fund money for the fund would have to be appropriated in a 
separate bill 
the bill provides compensation for people who got cancer in 
certain time periods and 
spent two years one year for some cancers in downwind areas 
of nevada arizona or utah from nuclear tests between 1951 and 
1958 or between june and july 1962 
or mined uranium in colorado new mexico arizona wyoming or 
utah from 1947 to 1971 
the justice department would process claims and determine the 
amount due 
a driving force behind the legislation was stewart udall former 
member of congress and interior secretary whose brother rep 
morris udall dariz is chairman of the house interior committee 
stewart udall represented the uranium miners in a lawsuit 
against the federal government the courts ruled the government was 
immune from prosecution because national security dictated a need 
for the uranium but judges involved in the case urged the miners 
to seek redress from congress 
calling it a good day for the people stewart udall said 
im hearing all kinds of voices that the president will sign it 
and i hope he will 
rep wayne owens dutah who once was a lawyer for the 
downwinders sponsored the legislation 
it seems so appropriate as we have watched in wonder at the 
demise of the cold war that we come and compensate the victims of 
the cold war that were downwind of the testing and the miners who 
mined the uranium said owens 
owens said he was a high school student in utah during the 
testing 
the government knew the potential dangers of nuclear fallout and 
no tests were conducted when the wind was blowing towards densley 
populated areas of california and nevada he said 
in very real fact the federal government made the decision to 
bomb these people to whom this bill makes an apology and a 
compensatory payment of a small amount he said 
aboveground nuclear tests throw radioactive debris into the 
atmosphere that can settle far away from the explosion site a 
major source of radioactivity in such cases was an isotope of 
strontium which was eaten by cows in their pastures passed on in 
their milk and taken up in human bones like calcium 
the united states and the soviet union agreed to stop testing 
above ground in 1963 
the radioactive decay of uranium releases radon a radioactive 
gas that can build up in mines it was the increase of lung cancer 
among miners that alerted public health authorities to the dangers 
of radon buildup in homes usually to much lower concentrations 
than in mines

the governor of macao linked to a 
corruption probe in the far east colony offered to resign 
thursday 
carlos melancia contends there were irregularities in the 
sevenmonth investigation into alleged attempts to sell privileges 
t a west german company seeking work on a planned international 
airport at the colony on the chinese coast near hong kong 
at a lisbon news conference malancia said he was indignant 
and surprised by the findings of the public prosecutors office 
and claimed the investigation was politically motivated 
malancias assistant francisco murteira nabo would take over 
as acting governor of the enclave of about 290000 people if the 
resignation is accepted macao government officials said 
the prosecutors report will be passed to a judge who has eight 
days to decide whether to charge melancia 
im certain the courts will recognize my innocence said 
malancia 
the investigation began following a series of portuguese 
newspaper reports 
in february the conservative lisbon weekly o independente 
published a copy of a fax allegedly sent to melancia from 
weidleplan consulting demanding the return of 368000 after the 
company failed to win a contract for work on the airport 
melancias supporters denounced the fax as a fake some have 
suggested the governor is victim of a plot to discredit president 
mario soares who appointed melancia to the governorship in 1987 
the false accusations of which i have been the target were in 
the framework of a public poison campaign orchestrated with 
political intentions melancia said 
he has threatened to press charges against o independente 
an official at stuttgart west germanybased weidleplan 
contacted thursday said the company would not comment on the case 
soares has called presidential elections in portugal for 
january the former socialist party leader is widely expected to 
run for a second term opinion polls show he has support of more 
than 60 percent of voters

reelection bid 
other figures named in connection with what has become known as 
fatal fax case include socialist supporters closely linked to 
soares 
a statement from the public prosecutors office said evidence 
had been found against others but they were not named

the senate judiciary committee approved the 
nomination of new hampshire jurist david h souter to the supreme 
court on thursday with but one dissenting vote 
the full senate is expected to confirm him easily when it votes 
next tuesday the day after the court begins its session 
democrats as well as republicans on the committee said they saw 
in president bushs nominee a brilliant legal scholar and a man of 
good temperament and integrity in the 131 vote only edward m 
kennedy dmass opposed him saying he feared souter would 
solidify a 54 anticivilrights antiprivacy majority 
howell heflin a conservative alabama democrat whose opposition 
helped kill the 1987 supreme court nomination of robert bork said 
he liked souters clearheaded approach and lack of an 
ideological agenda 
added howard metzenbaum dohio my sense is that david souter 
is a fair and openminded jurist who knows well the weight of the 
responsibilities which will be placed upon him 
bush hailed the committee action and repeated his request that 
the senate act as quickly as possible to confirm this man so he 
could be seated when the court begins its new session 
but senate majority leader george mitchell announced thursday 
night that he and republican leaders agreed to hold the 
confirmation vote on souter on tuesday 
the jewish holiday yom kippur which was interrupting congress 
schedule friday and biden and other democrats were loathe to waive 
rules that give senators time before voting to review a committees 
findings 
souter 51 in a statement released in new hampshire thanked 
committee leaders and members for their courtesy and 
consideration i am gratified by their action i await the decision 
of the full senate 
earlier tom rath like souter a former new hampshire attorney 
general said souter heard of the panels action on a radio in 
raths law office 
to get this kind of overwhelming support makes us feel very 
good rath said adding that souter would issue his separate 
statement as soon as the white house approved it 
the lopsided vote did not show the widespread unease on the 
committee caused by souters refusal to state his positions on 
abortion and other critical issues before the court 
judge souter is not the sort of judge i would nominate if i 
were president said committee chairman joseph biden ddel a 
supporter of abortion rights 
souter just barely met his criteria biden said but i 
think that he is about the best we can expect from bush who 
opposes abortion rights he said 
aspects of judge souters testimony were of little comfort to 
legal conservatives including this senator said gordon humphrey 
rnh in a statement released at the committee session but we 
recognize that the president is entitled to considerable deference 
in his choice for the supreme court 
humphreys new hampshire colleague warren rudman a republican 
not on the budget committee who has been souters mentor and senate 
champion said he was pleased with the vote and not disturbed by 
the reservations expressed by some members 
thats normal rudman said those are people whoare 
obviously concerned about staking out political grounds for the 
future and i can understand that 
democrats who supported souter expressed faith that he was as 
openminded on womens rights and other issues as he professed to 
be but kennedy refused to go along 
i am troubled that he will solidify a 54 
anticivilrights antiprivacy majority inclined to turn back the 
clock on the historic progress of recent decades kennedy said 
i hope i am wrong but i fear i am right kennedy said 
the lesson of the past decade is that we must vote our fears 
not our hopes 
i hope im not wrong said metzenbaum usually a kennedy 
ally in revealing his affirmative vote 
kennedy wont be quite so alone when the nomination comes before 
the full senate five other democrats had announced their 
opposition to the nomination by thursday mostly based on the 
abortion issue 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
attended thursdays committee meeting and said afterward i 
tremble for the women of the united states 
senate republicans urged the majority democrats to schedule a 
full senate vote before monday 
if we delay for only three days there will be a dozen cases in 
which he cannot participate said sen alan k simpson rwyo 
the deputy gop leader the court planned to hear arguments on four 
cases on each of the first three days next week

result in a presidential election as early as nov 25 
the election law passed 26812 authorizes the speaker of 
parliament to set a date for elections as quickly as 60 days a 
second round of elections is possible if no candidate gets 50 
percent of the ballots in the first round 
under the constitutional amendment approved 3254 the 
president is elected in a general ballot and may serve up to two 
fiveyear terms 
the parliament banned campaign financing from foreign sources 
and campaigning 36 hours before the election deputies refused a 
proposal to bar campaigning at churches and other religious sites 
a common activity in poland 
the changes require approval by the upper chamber senate and 
the president but that is considered likely the senate is in 
session friday 
solidarity leader lech walesa has already declared his candidacy 
in the first popular presidential ballot since before world war ii 
he seeks to succeed gen wojciech jaruzelski who is stepping down 
early as head of state 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a former adviser and ally of 
walesa also is considering running and is expected to announce his 
decision next week several other candidates are likely a 
candidate must be nominated by a party or else collect 100000 
signatures to get on the ballot 
a caucus representing former communists tried unsuccessfully to 
lower the number of signatures required to 50000 
jaruzelski asked parliament on sept 19 to shorten his term of 
office in order to permit an election in recent months there were 
increasing calls for the former communist party leader to step down 
as an unwanted symbol of the countrys old hardline order 
jaruzelski who ordered martial law in 1981 following 
solidarityled unrest was elected to a sixyear term as president 
in july 1989 by a joint session of the sejm or lower house and

religious leaders thursday condemned a new movie 
rating system as pandering to sexually exploitative material 
the church officials urged the motion picture association of 
america to reconsider its action replacing the x rating with 
the new no children or nc17 rating 
it is an arrogant and ill advised decision which deeply 
affects the public good it was made in isolation without public 
consultation the change is neither in the public interest nor in 
the best interest of the community the church leaders said in a 
joint statment 
the statement was issued by communication leaders of the us 
catholic conference and the national council of churches which 
includes most major protestant and eastern orthodox denominations 
they spoke out after the motion picture association wednesday 
said it has decided to substitute the new nc17 category for 
the x rating used on adult films since 1968 
the church officials charged that the association has caved in 
to the commercial interests of those who are attempting to get 
sexually exploitative material into general theatrical release 
they urged members of the national association of theater owners 
to refuse to book nc17 movies and newspapers and others to refuse 
to accept advertising for them 
changing the name of the x category does not change the 
nature of the material the statement said 
local congregations were also urged to monitor enforcement of 
age restrictions under the nc17 category and other categories 
the statement was issued by bishop edward j odonnell chairman 
of the communication committee of the us catholic conference and 
by beverly chain who heads the national councils communications 
unit 
they said the motion picture associations action will be used 
by those who already are calling for government regulation of the 
media 
that is unfortunate because a voluntary system of 
selfregulation that skirts constitutional concerns yet affords at 
least a minimum of protection to the public is workable 
the motion picture association said that under its changed 
rating system the existing r or restricted rating would be 
clarified to include an explanation of why a film was placed in 
that category 
such explanations could be an emphasis on such themes as sex 
violence profanity drug use or sucicide and would be made 
available to parents and other moviegoers 
as for the new nc17 films the association said they would 
continue to be evaluated as xrated films have been in the past 
that is on the basis that most parents would agree such films 
should not be viewed by youngsters

members of the sematech semiconductor research 
consortium have troubled relations with companies supplying 
materials and manufacturing equipment the general accounting 
office said thursday 
these weak relations coupled with the high cost of capital 
hinder efforts to strengthen the us materials and equipment 
industry supplier executives believe 
mark nelson sematechs director of government relations said 
the consortium has taken steps to better those relations 
the gao recognized a problem which we were already aware of 
and in the process of addressing nelson said weve already 
made significant progress since that survey with a new program of 
links with supplier companies 
fourteen computer companies belong to the sematech consortium 
backing it with 100 million that has been matched by congress each 
of the last three years 
the consortium undertakes research in the computer chips that 
form the foundation of a halftrillion dollar worldwide electronics 
industry 
in manufacturing equipment the japanese market share rose from 
25 percent in 1983 to 40 percent in 1988 while the us share 
dropped from 69 percent to 51 percent in the same period gao said 
gao the investigating arm of congress interviewed 31 supplier 
industry executives last spring 
it was supplier relations of consoritum members not the austin 
texasbased consortium itself that drew criticism 
the gao report said the suppliers want the consortium members to 
emulate sematechs example in working more closely with them 
the gao interviewers found that half their subjects said 
sematechs member companies need to establish better relationships 
with them 
the suppliers particularly wanted longterm relationships

using an obscure constitutional provision prime 
minister brian mulroney received permission thursday from queen 
elizabeth ii to appoint eight partisan senators to help push 
through a controversial tax 
the new lawmakers who serve until age 75 bring the senate to 
112 seats and give mulroneys conservative party a majority in both 
the senate and house of commons 
the new members were sworn into office by the senate clerk late 
thursday but will not take their seats until the chamber resumes 
work next week 
an opposition leader called mulroneys move an abuse of 
power and legal challenges loom the only other similar request 
was in 1873 but the appeal was not granted 
the nations 1867 constitution allows the british monarch to add 
four or eight members to the senate on a request by the 
governorgeneral the canadian representative to the commonwealth 
mulroney used the measure as a last resort to save the 7 percent 
goods and services tax stalled in the liberaldominated senate 
the commons dominated by conservatives supported the tax 
the proposed consumption tax would replace a 13 percent tax paid 
by manufacturers some basics such as groceries would be exempt 
from the tax but it would affect even such services as a haircut 
mulroney said the debate goes beyond the tax proposal to the 
principle of whether the elected commons should prevail over the 
appointed senate 
the consequences for our parliamentary system are enormous 
he said what is at stake is one of the principles of our 
freedom 
john haslam a spokesman for the queen said elizabeth as the 
constitutional monarch of the former british colony followed the 
provisions of the canadian constitution in making the decision 
but even with the additional seats the fate of the tax could 
rest on the votes of a handful of independents 
before mulroneys move the liberals held 52 seats and the 
conservatives 46 with one reform party representative four 
independents and one independent liberal 
over the last two months mulroney has filled 15 senate 
vacancies with conservative loyalists to narrow the gap 
liberal leader jean chretien warned the public will not back 
mulroney whose popularity has dipped sharply in polls 
when you are 15 percent in the polls and taking an abuse of 
power and stacking the senate he might find that he will not go 
very far politically with that he said 
and liberal senate leader allan maceachen promised that the 
fight against the tax will intensify 
it leaves me in an even more agressive mood maceachen said 
well continue the battle but unless all the independents 
vote with us we cant defeat it 
also legal challenges are threatened 
british columbia has said it will contest ottawas ability to 
create the extra senate seats ontario has said it may join that 
campaign alberta has promised a separate challenge on some aspects 
of the tax

trial according to romanian law ceausescu is eligible for 
successive releases on health grounds until he either recovers or

soviet religious leaders said thursday they are 
satisfied with the countrys new law on freedom of conscience but 
consider it a stopgap measure 
the law which the national legislature approved in principle on 
wednesday calls a halt to decades of repression by forbidding the 
government from interfering in the practice of religion 
it also improves the legal status of religious organizations 
guarantees the right to study religious doctrine and calls for a 
religious council to advise the government on human rights 
vatican chief spokesman joaquin navarro said the new law 
renders justice to millions of believers 
the ukrainian catholic church welcomes this first step toward 
true religious freedom added church head cardinal myroslav ivan 
lubachivsky 
russian orthodox baptist and jewish leaders told reporters at a 
press conference organized by the foreign ministry that the law is 
a major step forward but they said it is complex and unclear on 
some points 
i think this law will be of a transitional nature said 
georgi komendant president of the soviet baptist society in due 
time if eveything is ok it should be more brief less 
complicated 
komendant also said the spirit of the law official tolerance 
for religion is more important than the wording 
this is a good law and as baptists we are satisfied with 
it he said 
metropolitan pitirim a leader of the dominant russian orthodox 
church called the law unprecedented and said it can be 
considered successful as a first offspring of democratic reforms 
but he added a lot of provisions need clarifying 
among the ambiguities are whether public schools can teach about 
various religions whether the military should hold services for 
religious soldiers and whether conscientious objectors will be 
allowed an alternative to military duty 
the chief rabbi of moscow adolph shayevich said he helped 
draft the law and is generally happy with it but he expressed 
concern that it may not be respected 
our supreme soviet has adopted a lot of laws but 
unfortunately not all of them are fully effective he said it 
would be very regrettable if after adoption it takes a long time 
to implement this law 
shayevich also said he does not believe the law will reduce the 
flow of soviet jews to israel the main reasons for jewish 
emigration he said are antisemitism which has become more 
open and organized in recent years and the soviet economy 
which is beset by shortages inflation and inefficiency 
a member of the supreme soviet committee that drafted the law 
andrei sebentsov said the legislature is expected to give it final 
approval monday it was adopted in principle early wednesday by a 
vote of 3411 with one abstention 
we want to put an end to harassment of religious people and 
give them equal rights as they have in most countries sebentsov 
said 
of course we cant say that the law is ideal for the 
future but for the decade it is what our society needs he 
added 
western scholars estimate onequarter of the 285 million soviet 
people practice some faith and the number appears to be rising 
fast as official tolerance replaces hardline communist opposition 
to religion 
in recent years churches confiscated by the government have 
been reopened jews have been allowed to hold hebrew classes 
staterun television has broadcast holiday church services and 
government propaganda against religion has subsided

a judge thursday ordered ousted prime 
minister benazir bhutto to stand trial on two more corruption 
charges in a mounting legal onslaught that could disqualify her 
from next months election 
judge wajihuddin ahmed issued the notice for ms bhutto to 
appear before the tribunal on sunday to answer charges of 
misconduct and abuse of power during her 20month administration 
ms bhuttos husband asif ali zardari is also ordered to 
appear in court on sunday charged with failing to cooperate in a 
police investigation said the state news agency 
associated press of pakistan claimed the 38yearold zardari 
ignored several official requests to appear before the federal 
investigation agency 
ms bhutto already facing trial on two corruption charges in 
the eastern city of lahore was campaigning in the sindh province 
countryside and unavailable for comment 
her lawyers have not said whether she will appear before the 
special courts which could disqualify her from the oct 24 
election and bar her from politics for seven years if she is 
convicted she can be tried in absentia 
ms bhutto who won election in november 1988 and became the 
first woman to lead a modern moslem nation is a candidate for five 
seats in the 217member national assembly the policymaking lower 
house of parliament 
her aides say ms bhutto ran for five seats in case she was 
disqualified from some of the races 
the armybacked caretaker government has accused ms bhutto of 
illegally using an asia development bank loan to hire a foreign 
consulting firm to oversee a karachi power project 
she also have been accused of allowing a britishbased firm to 
export cotton at rates far below the international market rate 
costing the government an estimated 100 million 
president ghulam ishaq khan invoked his constitutional powers 
and dismissed ms bhutto on aug 6 he alleged that among other 
things her government used tens of millions of dollars in special 
funds to buy votes and political favors awarded lucrative buisness 
deals to friends and relatives and demanded commissions on 
government contracts 
earlier this week a tribunal in lahore ordered the 37yearold 
former prime minister to stand trial oct 2 for allegedly approving 
the illegal sale of 287 acres of federal land to a londonbased 
company operated by a cousin 
she is to be tried oct 9 for allegedly canceling contracts for 
distribution of liquified gas and awarding them to friends and 
relatives that she claimed had suffered during a decade of martial 
law 
ms bhutto has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly 
accused the president of corruption and nepotism 
the caretaker government comprised largely of ms bhuttos 
opponents and former allies has spent much of the past month 
trying to portray ms bhuttos administration as the most corrupt 
in pakistans 43year history 
most analysts say ms bhutto and the peoples party appear to be 
gaining strength and could emerge from next months election as the 
single largest bloc

the fbi is inquiring into the campaign 
finances of two texas democrats one of them running against the 
son of us commerce secretary robert mosbacher and the other 
against a candidate backed by president bushs eldest son 
the inquiries are politically motivated says one of the 
democrats agriculture commissioner jim hightower 
on monday fbi agent greg rampton obtained from the secretary of 
state copies of 198890 campaign finance reports filed by hightower 
and lieutenant governor hopeful bob bullock 
i resent the fbi getting into my political campaign with these 
kinds of overt acts of political activity hightower said 
thursday it amounts to nixonian dirty tricks here 
bullocks republican opponent is rob mosbacher jr son of us 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher hightower faces state rep 
rick perry a republican who has received backing from the 
presidents eldest son george w bush 
two democrats who the administration seems most interested in 
getting mr bullock because hes had the gall to run against mr 
mosbachers boy myself because ive been something of a burr 
under the saddle of the bush administration on their pricebusting 
farmbankrupting agriculture policies hightower said 
perry and mosbacher said they had nothing to do with the fbi 
inquiry 
i dont know anything more about it than ive read in the 
papers mosbacher said 
i dont know anybody in the fbi and i can assure you that 
none of them have talked to me perry said but he said the 
inquiry shows that irregularities in hightowers agency have 
caught the attention of federal authorities 
at a news conference hightower said rampton had questioned many 
of his agencys employees and tried to get one to wear a hidden 
microphone 
they tried to put a wire on one of my employees and send him 
in to talk to me they have harassed our office staff he 
charged 
neither byron sage agentincharge of the austin fbi office 
nor rampton returned telephone calls from the associated press 
their office referred inquiries to fbi spokesman claude martin in 
san antonio who didnt immediately return a call 
bullock the fiveterm state comptroller said the fbi inquiry 
may have stemmed from complaints by a disgruntled former employee 
bullock and hightower who is seeking reelection said they had 
done nothing wrong and had nothing to hide

four soldiers and three civilian military 
aides are being held in connection with the beheading of an 
american innkeeper a federal human rights official said thursday 
meanwhile a rights group claimed an army colonel and another 
officer are also involved in the june murder of michael devine 49 
who ran a small inn near the mayan ruins of tikal in northern 
guatemala 
the united states has threatened to cut off military aid to 
guatemala if the murder of devine a 19year resident of guatemala 
is not fully investigated 
guatemalas rights ombudsman fernando hurtado prem said his 
office had been conducting an independent investigation since june 
12 three days after devines body was found by a roadside 
hurtado prem cannot prosecute but can investigate and make 
recommendations 
he said the inquiry found several witnesses who linked the 
vehicle used by the killers to the military base at santa elena 
near the provincial capital of flores in northern guatemala 
he identified the soldiers suspected in the killings as rafael 
tiul cucul pablo lajuj ixmalej carlos zelada marroquin and 
augustin esquivel hernandez no ranks were given 
also held were ricardo guzman andres morente tipol and benjamin 
punji perush all civilians who work for the military as local 
commissioners hurtado prem said 
the guatemalan military maintains an extensive system of 
civilian collaborators such as commissioners and civil defense 
patrols to enforce its authority in the countryside and help 
battle the small force of leftists guerrillas who have been 
fighting the past 30 years 
the mutual support group said the excommander of the base col 
mario garcia catalan was also involved in the murder the colonel 
was relieved of his command earlier this month the rights advocacy 
group also accused another officer at the base 
the groups president nineth montenegro de garcia said she had 
discussed the case with a united nations rights observer christian 
tomuschat 
guatemalas bleak rights record prompted a total suspension of 
us aid between 1977 and 198 when a civilian government took 
office 
in the last year however the number of murders kidnappings 
and disappearances linked to the right wing and the military began 
rising sharply 
president vinicio cerezo promised a full investigation into 
devines murder in a recent letter to us ambassador thomas 
stroock devine a former peace corps volunteer was from 
belleville ill 
according to some reports us officials suspect he may have 
stumbled on evidence of military involvement in the drug trade

it has not been a quiet week in twin peaks the 
enigmatic little lumber town in the pacific northwest where the 
women are strange the men are oddlooking and the children are 
all above suspicion 
lake woebegon it aint twin peaks is not a place its a 
state of mind to which millions of americans will return sunday 
night for the season premiere of televisions oddest nighttime 
drama 
after eight episodes just seven days in twin peaks time we 
still dont know who killed laura palmer the homecoming queen 
whose plasticwrapped corpse fuels the series central mystery she 
is still dead maybe 
then theres wacky cherry piegobbling fbi agent dale cooper 
kyle maclachlan he has declared he knows the killers identity 
but in the season finale was laid low by an unknown assailant and 
three gunshots to the chest 
theres more one suspect in lauras killing has been smothered 
by her father another has been shot theres been a heart attack 
a drug overdose a lifethreatening fire and a brothelkeeper has 
unknowingly hired his own daughter 
as actor michael ontkean twin peaks doughty sheriff harry s 
truman observed the series is a kabukistyle peyton place on 
peyote buttons 
abc says little about the twohour special abc sunday night 
movie directed by david lynch and written by mark frost 
cocreators of the series 
the investigation into the mysterious killing continues 
sorrow settles over the community as several lives hang in the 
balance abc said audrey horne finds herself a terrified 
prisoner and donna hayward receives a strange message 
this is a strange time for a strange series 
it was conceived by lynch the high priest of cinematic anxiety 
eraserhead the elephant man dune blue velvet 
and wild at heart and frost an established tv producer from 
hill street blues 
a midseason replacement twin peaks was the years most 
writtenabout show even before its april 8 debut won a 33 percent 
share of the tv audience it quickly became the most talkedabout 
show on television 
were just trying to reimagine the genre of the nighttime 
soap in the way that hill street blues did the cop show a decade 
ago frost said but it was much more than that 
viewers got a sense of place in twin peaks its geography and 
exteriors provided by the lovely town of snoqualmie wash the town 
was as placid as a forest pond where every droplet teems with 
violent microscopic life 
the critics loved the shows dreamlike allusive imagery the 
dazzling cinematography of ron garcia and the ethereal score of 
composer angelo badalamenti 
most of all they loved the townspeople mordantly eccentric 
characters whose plots and subplots were cryptic to the point of 
inscrutability 
every conversation had meaning every gesture was freighted with 
hidden significance every scene charged with a sense that 
something dreadful was about to happen the tension wasnt 
relieved only punctuated by black comedy 
there had never been anything like it on television 
even film critic pauline kael of the new yorker magazine was 
hooked it has both the insidious weirdness of of lynchs best 
movie work and the weird insidiousness of topoftheline tv trash 
lynch sets us drifting through a vivid dream of american 
life 
the new york times adored twin peaks dont miss it 
said one review its editorial page ventured that the series has 
been hailed as revolutionary tv it has become in any case a 
phenomenon heady stuff that 
i killed laura palmer tshirts appeared food writers 
devoted columns to cherry pie on fridays the shows ardent fans 
would gather to analyze every clue and argue over meanings 
computer enthusiasts would bicker about the show on electronic 
bulletin boards ordinarily sensible people who wouldnt admit to 
watching thirtysomething became instant babbling fans 
hailed as the television show of the 90s twin peaks was 
everything except a hit 
its opening audience share of 33 percent quickly slumped when 
twin peaks went to its regular time slot thursday nights 
against nbcs blockbuster cheers twin peaks gradually lost 
about half of its viewers 
the season finale won its time period with a 126 rating and a 
22 share or about 97 million viewers a ratings point represented 
921000 tv households a share the percentage of all tv sets in use 
tuned to a given show 
it finished the season with a respectable if unspectacular tie 
for 40th place but abc already had decided to renew the show on 
oct 6 it moves to saturday night with china beach the 
critically acclaimed vietnam war series 
abc says both shows attract adult viewers ages 18 to 49 a 
demographic group prized by advertisers about 40 million of whom 
tune in on saturday nights abcs secret fear is that twin 
peaks will lose to rented videos 
twin peaks fared poorly in the annual emmy awards despite 
its 14 nominations the most of any drama it won only two 
technical awards 
daily variety the trade journal blamed that on critics who 
may actually have done it a disservice attaching expectations to 
it that it will be hardpressed to meet 
 
elsewhere in television 
twin peaks sidebar alert vh1 presents a visually stylish 
documentary saturday night on the collaboration of the ethereal 
twin peaks singer julee cruise series composer angelo 
badalamenti and producerdirector david lynch 
it features interviews with the principals clips from twin 
peaks but no clues to the series mysteries and excerpts from 
their performance piece industrial symphony no 1

is michael milken the selfless quiet 
conservative religious civicminded philanthropic father 
husband and family man he is depicted in letters to the judge who 
will sentence him 
or is he the greedy powerseeking conspiratorial corrupt 
confessed criminal who systematically and fraudulently engaged in 
illegal payoffs and other acts to gain a fabulous income as 
depicted by prosecutors 
hundreds of letters in support of milken have been received by 
judge kimba wood leading a reader to wonder if michael milken is 
possessed of two utterly disparate personalities 
that is only the beginning of the questions provoked by the 
letters all written in an effort to convince wood that milken 
should be sentenced to less than the maximum term of 28 years and 
instead be ordered to assist in community projects 
the letters whch describe a private person so unlike the 
public image of milken the confessed criminal provide an unusual 
psychological case study of human behavior and perception 
there are letters from attorneys for instance that emphasize 
milkens personal values and contain nothing whatever about legal 
issues 
there is praise from beneficiaries of milkens charities 
without reference to the possibility that the funds assigned to 
them were obtained illegally 
there are business people suggesting that milkens values are so 
unlike and higher than those of so many business people 
and there are educators who tell of how milken by his personal 
example and effort is a positive influence on the education of 
children 
daryl gates los angeles police chief says he pursues a hard 
line against criminals he suggests the court could consider 
milkens financial expertise in arriving at a productive rather 
than solely punitive sentence 
los angeles archbishop roger mahony observes that his schools 
seek to instill decent values in the lives of young students he 
asks that milken be sentenced to enhanced community service 
rather than punished by jail 
richard adler is a judge of the california superior court but 
his letter to judge wood refers only to milkens character and his 
ability as a mathematics teacher including personal help he gave 
to the judges son 
steven j ross chairman of timewarner inc is widely known as 
a sharp nononsense harddriving businessman he writes that 
milken is no ivan boesky or martin siegel no gordon gekko no 
yuppie no wheeler and dealer 
instead he says milken is a person of ideas and ideals 
and strangely immaterialistic a longterm thinker not a 
quickbuck artist a man who sometimes put client financial 
interests ahead of his own 
the letters are almost invariably long far longer rambling 
repetitive and anecdotal than ordinary business letters but 
otherwise unsually well presented ross letter is five typwritten 
pages but others are twice that length 
almost all writers comment positively on an aspect of milkens 
personality and way of life his loyalty concern love of 
children quiet family life religious commitment honesty or 
devotion to people and causes 
themes reappearing throughout the file of letters are that bad 
things happen to good people that the tragedy of human frailty can 
destroy otherwise strong human beings and the belief that good 
deeds should mitigate penalties 
whatever is made of the letters now is likely to be magnified 
and examined in detail after the sentence is pronounced and one 
question that will be asked over and over is whether the support of 
the big would ever be so available to the small

israeli soldiers are drawn as dogs and jewish 
settlers as rats toting rifles as for the arabs theyre depicted 
as having sinister mustaches and jagged scars across their cheeks 
the drawings are not the work of political cartoonists on one 
side or other in the arabisraeli conflict they are illustrations 
for childrens books meant to entertain and teach palestinian or 
israeli youngsters 
professor adir cohen author of a study of herrew childrens 
literature called an ugly face in the mirror says such books 
give birth to lifelong hatreds among israelis and palestinians 
we learned from freud how stories and fairytales enter our 
subconscious it infiltrates to those places of the 
subconscious and comes up repeatedly said cohen head of the 
education department at haifa university 
he described arabs in hebrew childrens books as having a huge 
terrible mustache and scary eyes the nose of an eagle a scar 
and a narrow forehead 
we are talking about processes of dehumanization that are 
connected to the arabisraeli struggle connected to defense and 
wars he said it is much easier to fight a roach 
cohen used as an example the typical detective stories for young 
boys who in a few years will be soldiers in which the israeli 
hero battles arab murderers bandits or terrorists 
in avner carmielis the young detectives settle in the wild 
negev a young hero overcomes hundreds of arabs among them 
kings he lines up his prisoners and strides up and down shouting 
left left faster gamal abdul nasser straighten your 
backs hussein and faisel look front nuri asaid 
the book goes on to explain how the kings and dictators and 
leaders marched forward quickly under his orders the names used 
are typically arab but gamal abdul nasser was also the late 
egyptian president who was one of israels chief enemies 
many of the hebrew books with such messages are aimed at boys in 
their preteens similar arab literature is intended for even 
younger readers who in other societies might be reading about fairy 
princesses 
in nasser abed alaltifs the flower beauty queen jewish 
settlers in the occupied west bank are pictured as rats wielding 
rifles former prime minister menachem begin curls his dragon claws 
over an arab village in hamdan yusefs the sad times of deir 
yassin 
khawla abu bakr author of a study called the political 
socialization of palestinian children by means of arab childrens 
literature says west bank childrens books have as many 
stereotypes as israeli works 
the israeli soldier is always depicted as a wolf a chicken 
an elephant dogs she said human figures are always seen as 
bureaucrats inconsiderate officials police who break arms or 
cruel soldiers 
abu bakr an arab israeli from the jewisharab seaside town of 
akko defended the stereotypes of israeli soldiers as a reflection 
of the arab childrens daily life 
for example she said a story by rawdeh alhodhod called the 
secret of the red devils in el bire tells of arab boys on a trip 
who are arrested after one of them throws a stone at an army jeep 
youngsters often have been at the forefront of the palestinian 
uprising that began in december 1987 thousands of youngsters have 
been arrested and 158 palestinian children aged 16 and under have 
died of israeli army or civilian gunfire 
palestinian childrens books also make references to the real 
world the deir yassin mentioned in hamdan yusefs book was an arab 
village where more than 200 palestinian men women and children 
were massacred by jewish militiamen in 1948 
another feature of the arab childrens books is a clearly stated 
moral the story of the arrested boys concludes our enemy is not 
the boy but the soldier the boy is a hero and did nothing 
wrong to be punished for you have to suffer and be a man 
cohen agreed that the intefadeh or palestinian uprising 
enforces the message in the palestinian books but he noted many 
were published before the revolt no doubt had we known how to 
read this literature correctly years ago we would have seen how 
they were preparing for the intefadeh he said 
for his study cohen examined more than 500 hebrew works and 
interviewed hundreds of jewish children to determine the influence 
of the books abu bakr studied 300 books written in israel the 
west bank jordan lebanon and egypt 
cohen said he hoped a new stream of israeli childrens 
literature stressing coexistence would gain in readership but he 
added that adventure stories featuring israeli heroes and wicked 
arabs remain more popular 
abu bakr said stories without stereotypes are too much to expect 
from an occupied people 
she added that her favorite story was hassan and the monster 
by taghred el najer which tells of a little boy who ignores 
villagers warnings and climbs a mountain to meet the oneeyed 
hairy monster who eats children 
at the top its the monster who is frightened by the boys 
strange appearance his two eyes and fair skin boy and monster 
realize they can be friends despite their differences and fears 
and they walk off together into the sunset

yesterday he had been happy but this sorrow descending upon 
him as it had the night before seemed to have confounded him

late afternoon william styron looks tired 
slouched in a chair in his hotel room his tie and jacket lying on 
the bed the air is hot and musty and the curtains are almost 
completely drawn blocking out the sun of a crisp september day 
the author is making a twoday trip to new york to promote 
darkness visible a memoir of madness a brief chronicle of his 
nearsuicidal bout with depression and eventual recovery 
the night before he appeared in a packed manhattan auditorium 
at the 92nd st y poetry center reading one passage from his new 
book and another from a novel in progress he seemed comfortable 
discussing his problems and expressed delight that his book had 
temporarily knocked donald trumps latest opus from the top of 
bestseller lists the audience responded enthusiastically 
but styron was also anxious to finish agreeing to a mere five 
to six minutes of questions and checking his watch to make sure 
that limit was not broken 
at his hotel room the author is again checking his watch he 
seems edgy distracted noting periodically he has to leave the 
hotel at 515 pm sharp that evening vanity fair is holding a 
reception in his honor at the century club his original article on 
depression had first appeared in the magazine 
 
i barely realized it but i was in a deep crisis i actually 
had ached so intensely over this wicked this monstrous 
disappoinment this betrayal that a kind of quivering st 
vitus dance had begun to possess my limbs i was suffering 
from an anxiety attack which each one of my psychic monitors had 
begun to regard gravely flashing alerts all through my flesh 
sophies choice 
 
darkness visible begins with a trip to paris in the fall of 
1985 when styron realized his emotional difficulties of the past 
several months might have a fatal outcome 
he soon broke down completely unable to sleep or drive or write 
and barely capable of speaking alcohol nauseated him in the book 
he admits to a history of heavy drinking and at the reading he said 
he still enjoys a glass of wine and the author was seized by 
uncontrollable fits of anxiety 
antidepressant medication prescribed by a psychiatrist only 
worsened his condition by early december he was ready to kill 
himself he couldnt even write a suicide note but drew upon 
some last gleam of sanity and checked into a hospital instead 
recuperating after a sevenweek stay 
i havent had any real afteraffects for a long long time 
styron insisted during the interview its over ive tried to 
make a point about it once its over its over once people get 
well theyre restored to the way they were before 
other writers have suffered from depression including f scott 
fitzgerald and sylvia plath leo tolstoys midlife crisis led him 
to become a devout christian philip roth writes about his problems 
in zuckerman unbound and the counterlife and camus novel 
the fall is a monologue by a depressed lawyer 
william james in the varieties of religious experience says 
it is a positive and active anguish a sort of physical neuralgia 
wholly unknown to normal life 
styron 65 could easily pass for a senator or a head of state 
he is stocky and broadshouldered with a wide forehead jowls 
nearly white hair and narrow eyes pinched at the edges his speech 
is fluid polished the vowels clipped the timbre rich 
he is a man who likes to get things finished done with a 
native of newport news va he knew in his late teens he wanted to 
be a writer and was impatient to get his first book published 
that came in 1951 with lie down in darkness a sprawling 
novel influenced by william faulkner and centered ironically on a 
young womans suicide 
styron has since become one of the most honored writers of the 
past 40 years winner in 1967 of the pulitzer prize for the 
confessions of nat turner and the american book award in 1979 for 
sophies choice which included a double suicide 
but there has also been this nagging sense of unfinished 
business it started at age 13 the author said with the death of 
his mother he became a hell raiser as a child admitting now 
he should have properly expressed his grief allowed it to work its 
way through his system 
if there were any guilty feelings about his mother styron did 
have a chance to make amends at an early age he served as a 
lieutenant in the marines during world war ii and in 1945 was 
stationed in okinawa he was to take part in the invasion of japan 
and didnt expect to come out alive 
the invasion never occurred the united states dropped the atom 
bomb instead 
some of my problems i think came from a continuing anguish 
over my mothers death and if i had gotten shot it would have been 
i suppose some kind of completion its hard to say how that would 
have worked out said styron who lives in connecticut with his 
wife they have four children 
when i was a young marine platoon leader there was this 
incredible sense of fate the myth at that age is youre going to 
live forever well i never believed that and my friends didnt i 
thought i was going to die 
styron insists go with the flow is now his philosophy the 
world will roll merrily on without me if i stop writing he says 
there are regrets about not having written richard iii but the 
author still looks back on a respectable body of work and 
considers darkness visible a fitting way to put his troubles 
behind him 
one thing you do learn is that youre really at the whim of 
forces beyond your control he said most people think mental 
health is something theyre invulnerable to they go through life 
thinking its something that happens to other people 
when the interview ends styron puts on his jacket moves over 
to the bed and sits for his picture to be taken his wrist turning 
for another look at the watch its 505 pm 
he doesnt shake hands but shyly lowers his face and mumbles 
goodbye perhaps thinking about the evening ahead or simply 
looking forward to finishing this trip and going home 
 
the grief is coming now she said to herself hes beginning 
to know what suffering is perhaps thats good for a man 
finally to know what suffering is to know what a woman somehow 
knows from the day she was born william styron lie down in 
darkness

whatever results from the ongoing 
multinational trade talks in geneva will help set the tone for the 
european communitys new togetherness in 1992 
if the talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
wind up on a liberalized note of international cooperation and good 
will the mood could prevail after the 12nation ec further 
integrates itself two years from now 
at least thats the rough idea being tossed around by some 
agriculture department analysts looking at the 1992 plan shaping up 
to make the ec truly a common market in europe 
the current gatt talks the socalled uruguay round of 
negotiations are scheduled to conclude at the end of this year 
in many respects the negotiations have been a snarling 
confrontation between the united states which wants to phase out 
export subsidies and a bundle of other protectionist policies and 
the ec which prefers less drastic remedies 
walter gardiner of the departments economic research service 
says there has been a mixed reaction among americans to europes 
unification plan designed to make the bloc a true common market 
by the end of 1992 
many believe the ec will be an even more powerful bloc that will 
mean greater competition for us goods and services in europe and 
in foreign markets generally 
the label fortress europe has been used by a number of us 
and other nonec officials to describe the potential market and 
investment environment that could emerge if nonmember countries 
dont pay close attention to developments gardiner said 
basically he said the plan is to remove all existing 
internal barriers to the free movement of goods services people 
and capital that gardiner said was what the communitys 
founders had in mind 33 years ago 
gardiners analysis was described in the october issue of 
farmline magazine and in a paper published last summer by him and 
two other economists steve neff and david kelch 
despite the hundreds of directives involved in developing the 
1992 plan there are no provisions for liberalizing any of the ecs 
external trade barriers the ones that affect the united states 
and other trading partners 
any progress on that front will depend on the outcome of the 
gatt talks in geneva 
however the adjustments to investment production 
consumption and trade patterns within the ec in response to the 
large number of 1992 directives will be felt far beyond the ecs 
borders gardiner said 
there will be greater opportunities for those able to compete in 
a deregulated ec economy particularly those firms already doing 
business there and who are making the necessary changes in 
anticipation of 1992 he said 
for companies such as equipment manufacturers that are 
required to build as many as eight production lines for tractors 
because of different regulations in ec countries any harmonization 
should be a welcome development he said 
also eliminating customs regulations at borders within the ec 
should reduce significantly the cost of transporting goods within 
the community he said 
but as of now there are no clear indications whether the ec 
will adopt standards and regulations more restrictive than those 
now in place or whether the ec may raise new barriers against the 
goods of nonmember countries 
gardiner said the ec and the united states share a number of 
important economic relationships that indicate a high degree of 
mutual dependence 
for openers he said the united states and the ec are the 
worlds two leading economic blocs accounting for about onehalf 
of the worlds gross domestic product gdp and merchandise trade 
the gdp is the total of a countrys goods and services 
the united states is also a major ec investor with 1285 
billion invested directly in 1988 or 39 percent of total us 
foreign investment that represents a vast increase over the 201 
billion invested in 1970 which was 27 percent of total us 
foreign investment at the time 
also he said the united states and the ec are each others 
largest trading partners with twoway trade totaling 1609 
billion in 1988 us mercandise exports to the ec have risen 
sixfold from 123 billion in 1970 to 759 billion in 1988 
in the same period us imports from the ec rose nearly 
ninefold from 97 billion to 85 billion 
agricultural trade is an important part of this trade although 
there were large fluctuations in the 1980s gardiner said us 
agricultural sales totaled 23 billion in 1970 peaked at 11 
billion in 1980 and then plummeted to 65 billion by 1985 
with the weakening of the dollar relative to european 
currencies near the end of 1985 farm exports began to recover 
slightly in 1986 rising to 73 billion by 1988 but amounting to 
only twothirds of the record level set in 1980 he said

tell the story it is a litany of despair of hunger and 
homelessness and hopelessness 
every day somewhere in the world 40000 children die most 
succumb to preventable diseases like measles and diarrhea the rest 
are victims of abuse neglect poverty starvation and war 
amnesty international recently reported that police in brazil 
and guatemala torture and summarily execute street children 
hundreds of iraqi children have been tortured or murdered by saddam 
husseins government in liberia the government and its opponents 
have killed or mutilated thousands of children during states of 
emergency in south africa an estimated 10000 children were 
detained without charge or trial some for as long as a year 
millions of children in developing countries die each year from 
diarrhea by the year 2000 at least 10 million children will be 
infected with the aids virus and another 10 million will by 
orphaned by the fatal disease the world health organization 
estimates

in the 200th year since the birth of the first 
amendment the winds of censorship are gusting stronger than ever 
this could be called the year of the censor 
federal support of arts projects deemed obscene has been 
threatened record store owners face fines and possible arrest for 
selling lps containing lyrics or artwork dubbed obscene a rash of 
movies have been slapped with the dreaded x rating and a museum is 
going on trial for obscenity an american first 
already the film industry is adjusting the x rating was 
eliminated wednesday by the motion picture association of america 
which substituted a new nc17 rating that bars children altogether 
but does not carry the stigma of the x 
throughout the history of the united states censorship in one 
form or another political religious moral or military has 
stalked literature dance opera film music and art 
this the land of the fruited plain home of the brave and 
citadel of free speech banned walt whitmans leaves of grass 
took the wiggle out of mae wests walk cut the moaning from ray 
charles whatd i say burned james joyces ulysses put 
lenny bruce in jail and kept isadora duncan from dancing 
now the contemporary arts center in cincinnati and its director 
dennis barrie face misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and 
displaying nude photos of children in an exhibit of photographer 
robert mapplethorpe a homosexual who died of aids last year jury 
selection in a county court began last week 
a mapplethorpe exhibit last june at the corcoran gallery of art 
in washington was canceled after sen jesse helms rnc declared 
some of the artists photographs to be obscene helms objections 
resulted in a move by congress to limit federal funds to the arts 
i wasnt starting out to make a statement that isnt the way 
i work mapplethorpe once said the statement grows out of what 
i do 
in 1979s easter lilies with mirror mapplethorpe uses four 
panels to form a cross around a center mirror the lilies are shown 
in dramatic shadows a dusting of light illuminating their inner 
and almost religious beauty it is a way of engaging the viewer 
beyond mere voyeurism the viewer becomes a part of the work 
but other works are disturbing unraveling a violent homosexual 
mystique for an unsuspecting audience they are terrifying 
sadomasochistic tableaux chained men leatherbound men men 
prepared for pain in an aristocratic setting anal sex games 
urination 
mapplethorpes defenders cite the first amendment which says 
that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom or 
speech or the press but courts have issued opinions back 
and forth since 1791 in 1957 the us supreme court gave its 
first ruling on a definition of obscenity saying it could not be 
protected by the first amendment 
justice william brennan however added the portrayal of sex 
eg in art literature and scientific works is not sufficient 
reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of 
speech and press 
in 1973 the high court agreed to a new set of rules for states 
to determine what was obscene states could enact laws banning 
artistic works if they portrayed sex in a patently offensive way 
and which taken as a whole do not have serious literary artistic 
political or scientific value 
in june a us district court judge ruled that the rap group 2 
live crews lp as nasty as they wanna be which speaks 
graphically about sexual violence towards women was obscene 
plays and playwrights have faced censorship in america 
in a boston production of edward albees whos afraid of 
virginia woolf the character martha bellowed at her husband 
jesus christ youre trying to hump the hostess city censors 
forced the playwright to change the line because it took the 
lords name in vain said martha in the rewritten version mary 
magdalene youre trying to hump the hostess 
the muted nudity in the broadway smash hair was challenged 
in new york by a group of clergymen in 1968 
sister mary ignatius explains it all for you incurred the 
wrath of boston mayor raymond flynn when it ran there in 1984 
because it discussed abortion and homosexuality 
music too has had its romp with censors elvis the pelvis had 
to be shot from the waist up when he appeared on the ed sullivan 
show in 1956 so americans wouldnt be offended by those gyrating 
hips that helped make presley famous a decade later sullivan made 
the rolling stones change the lyrics to their song lets spend 
the night together they sang lets spend some time together 
instead 
in 1967 van morrison had a hit with browneyed girl which 
contained the line making love in the green grass an alternate 
version had to be made for objecting radio stations 
radio stations also demanded an alternate version to lloyd 
prices stagger lee in one two men have a fight playing cards 
and one shoots the other in the cleanedup version the men argue 
but patch it up and are sore no more 
jimi hendrix had to take the naked women off his electric

but in no area has censorship so inflamed a passionate public as 
in literature 
according to the postmaster general of the united states in 
1959 lady chatterleys lover was an obscene and filthy 
work that could not be sent through the mail the ban was lifted 
a year later 
the post office burned 500 copies of ulysses in new york in 
1922 and the book considered a literary masterpiece was banned 
until 1933 the novel much of it written in stream of 
conciousness ripples with sex and sensuality 
and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and 
then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and 
first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he 
could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like 
mad and yes i said yes i will yes 
henry millers tropic of cancer and all of his other works 
were banned in the united states until 1961 
theodore dreisers an american tragedy was kept off the 
shelves in massachusetts the diary of anne frank the wizard 
of oz and works by mark twain and stephen king have at one time 
or another been removed from libraries 
movies also have been a target 
as early as 1897 moralists railed against anything remotely 
suggesting sex some movie theater owners put white stripes across 
the screen when showing fatima a reel featuring a fully 
clothed dancer wiggling her hips and shaking her breasts 
there were censorship drives by clergymen to tell the public 
what they should and should not see and in 1922 hollywood decided 
to censor itself and made president hardings campaign manager 
will h hays the head of the motion picture producers and 
distributors of america he reigned for 25 years until the current 
ratings system came into being 
the hays office initially held up gone with the wind because 
of clark gables famous exit line frankly my dear i dont give 
a damn 
as late as 1953 otto premingers the moon is blue earned a 
production code ban for using such naughty words as virgin and 
mistress other terrible words appeared in anatomy of a 
murder such as contraception 
and in 1988 martin scorseses the last temptation of christ 
was called blasphemy by religious leaders 
more recently a rash of movies has earned the now defunct x 
rating including pedro almodovars tie me up tie me down 
filmmakers hope the new rating will carry none of the 
advertising and exhibition restraints of the x rating which had 
become synonymous with hardcore pornography and served no purpose 
in evaluating artistic films best suited for adults 
its a great step said philip kaufman director of the 
xrated universal pictures film henry amp june the historical 
drama which features some explicit sex was set for a ratings 
appeal next week and will be the first recipient of the new nc 
rating which would bar children under age 17 
im just really delighted that we can show this film uncut in 
america and show the film the way i made it kaufman said it 
is not intended as a prurient film

the supreme court begins its 199091 term 
monday with disputes looming over abortion counseling fetal 
protection school desegregation and the war on drugs 
there will also be a new face on the court this term david h 
souter 
among the cases to be heard this week without souter are an 
important desegregation battle from oklahoma city and a bigmoney 
showdown over punitivedamage awards 
president bush picked the conservative souter a federal judge 
from new hampshire as the 105th member of the high court 
replacing its longtime liberal leader justice william j brennan 
we see troubled times said john powell chief lawyer of the 
american civil liberties union in assessing the coming term the 
court has shown a willingness to reconsider and cut back hardwon 
victories we thought were long over 
souter whose vote is seen as pivotal in abortion affirmative 
action and churchstate relations cases could pad chief justice 
william h rehnquists working conservative majority souters 
nomination was endorsed thursday by the senate judiciary committee 
and sent to the full chamber for confirmation 
abortion rights advocates who oppose his selection said souter 
if given the chance would provide the critical fifth vote to 
overturn the courts 1973 roe vs wade decision which legalized 
abortion 
his adamant refusal in his senate confirmation hearings to 
be candid in the area of privacy and abortion can do nothing but 
create the very reasonable and strong inference that he is prepared 
to jettison established law said helen neuborne of the national 
organization for womens legal defense and education fund 
under supreme court practice souter would not be able to 
participate in cases argued before he joined the court if the 
justices find themselves split 44 on such a case they could order 
it reargued later in the ninemonth term to let souter cast the 
deciding vote 
the court already has agreed to decide 54 cases by july when 
its term will end and probably will add 70 to 80 more in the 
coming weeks 
the first cluster will be added monday when the justices are 
expected to issue orders in more than 1000 appeals the vast 
majority will be rejected but some will be granted review by the 
court 
in one of its most closely watched cases the justices must 
decide whether federal regulations violate freespeech rights by 
barring governmentfinanced family planning clinics from offering 
abortion counseling 
at stake is the future scope of a 200 millionayear federal 
program that finances more than 4000 clinics serving some 5 
million lowincome women 
the family planning program enacted by congress as title x of 
the public health service act forbids clinics from using federal 
funds to perform abortions although it originally let clinic 
staffs tell women about the abortion option 
but the reagan administration in 1988 issued regulations that 
say clinics receiving federal support may not encourage promote 
or advocate abortion as a method of family planning or even 
distribute written materials on abortion 
if a woman visiting such a clinic asks about abortion the 
regulations tell doctors and counselors to say the program does 
not consider abortion an appropriate method of family planning 
and to offer help in obtaining prenatal care 
the senate last week voted to amend title x to nullify the 
regulations against abortion counseling if the senate action 
becomes law the court challenge of the regulations will become 
meaningless 
in a case that could affect millions of working women the court 
is reviewing an employers policy of excluding all women of 
childbearing age from some hazardous jobs 
a fetalprotection policy used by johnson controls a 
milwaukeebased battery manufacturer bans women who cannot prove 
they are infertile from jobs that expose them to lead the policy 
is being attacked as a form of illegal sex discrimination 
among those who sued were a 50yearold divorcee and a woman who 
submitted to sterilization to preserve her job 
a federal appeals court upheld the policy by a 74 vote but one 
dissenting judge said 20 million industrial jobs may be closed to 
women because many substances in addition to lead pose fetal 
risks 
the oklahoma city desegregation case asks whether school 
districts may abandon mandatory busing and other courtordered 
plans after achieving racial balance in student populations 
hundreds of school districts including those in most major 
cities operate courtordered desegregation plans only a few have 
persuaded courts to declare their oncesegregated systems fully 
integrated 
nevertheless the potential impact of the courts ruling is 
great critics say letting students attend neighborhood schools 
will result in resegregation 
the court will confront one aspect of the war on drugs when it 
reviews a michigan law that imposes mandatory life sentences 
without possibility of parole for people even firsttime 
offenders convicted of possessing certain amounts of drugs 
a man convicted of possessing 23 ounces of cocaine and given 
such a sentence says he received cruel and unusual punishment 
his lawyers note that convictions for seconddegree murder and 
other violent crimes do not carry such stiff sentences 
the justices were told that michigan is the only state that 
imposes such a mandatory sentence if the law is upheld other 
states might follow michigans lead 
here in summary form are some of the other cases the court is 
to decide this term

the poster on christine and dale johnsons 
kitchen wall reads our veggies dont do drugs 
a jar on the kitchen table holds wasp eggs future natural 
predators to be used instead of pesticides against the tomato 
hornworm a nasty critter a voracious eater said mrs 
johnson 
the johnsons run an organic farm growing peppers squash kale 
cherry tomatoes eggplant lettuce and other produce on their 65 
acres on the eastern shore of chesapeake bay 
many people tell opinion surveys they are willing to pay more 
for organic food grown without synthetic fertilizers pesticides 
or insecticides 
but growers retailers consumer groups and environmentalists 
say the organic food industry has been handicapped by the lack of 
consistent national standards to answer the question what is 
organic food 
i think the consumer has the right to the assurance that the 
organic label means something mrs johnson said the consumer 
can often be deceived possibly pay more for a product thats no 
better than another 
twentytwo states have regulations defining organic farming 
they all follow the same basic idea but no two are identical in 
other states organic farms are certified by private organizations 
applying their own standards 
organic agriculture is a funny word organic by definition in 
websters would just be carbonbased said joseph dunsmoor 
founder of the organic food distributor organic farms in 
beltsville md you can say organic agriculture means you dont 
use farm chemicals its a whole lot more than that 
but what 
this year congress is taking a stab at an answer the house and 
senate both approved programs for nationwide organic farming 
standards as part of the 1990 farm bill 
the conference committee that will resolve differences between 
the two bills is waiting for a budget deal so it knows how much 
money has to be cut from farm support programs but the organic 
provisions are expected to survive 
organically produced food defies simple definition the 
senate agriculture committee said when it adopted its version so a 
complicated definition was offered 
organic food is food produced using sustainable production 
methods that rely primarily on natural materials the committee 
began there are exceptions some synthetic chemicals 
traditionally accepted in organic farming and a few natural 
substances so toxic they are banned 
those exceptions are to be spelled out in a list drawn up by a 
national organic standards board to be made up of organic farmers 
wholesalers and retailers consumer representatives and 
environmentalists 
rules for raising organic meat and poultry are even more 
confusing than for vegetables its left to the standards board to 
figure out what livestock medications vaccines and parasiticides 
are to be legal for organic farmers 
within two years shoppers should be seeing us 
governmentcertified organic chickens tomatoes and bell peppers in 
the stores 
the legislation allows for state and private organizations to do 
the inspection and certification so long as they follow the 
national standards states also would be permitted to enact 
stricter standards if they wished but could not block imports of 
nationally certified organic food from other states 
the organic farming provisions were backed vigorously by 
lobbyists from environmental groups who say overuse of chemical 
pesticides fungicides and fertilizers is polluting streams and 
endangering farm workers 
chemical manufacturers reject any suggestion their products are 
unsafe but approve the idea of nationwide standards for organic 
agriculture said christopher klose spokesman for the national 
agricultural chemicals association 
the small but growing organic farm industry also supported the 
plan for nationwide standards and labeling 
for both the consumer and the grower there are going to be 
multiple benefits it makes marketing much easier said marty 
rice codirector of the maryland organic food and farming 
association which was founded last year 
dale johnson driving boxes of organic kale in from his fields 
in a white pickup said he hoped the governmentapproved organic 
labels will boost the market for organic foods 
people say they want it and are willing to pay more for it 
but that hasnt translated into a bigger market on the east 
coast he said 
supermarkets however report falling interest in organic foods 
a lot of consumers will buy it one time for the novelty but 
the repeat sales dont seem to be there said nancy yanish 
director of agricultural relations for the food marking institute 
in washington if consumers want it supermarkets will be glad to 
sell it 
two major grocery chains in the washington area giant and 
safeway once had organic produce sections in some of their stores 
both dropped the idea in the past year after disappointing sales 
the trade weekly supermarket news reported similar experiences 
nationwide asking in an article last may is organic produce 
withering on the vine 
organic farm organizations however report their production up 
by as much as 40 percent over last year stores specializing in 
natural and organic foods seem to be doing fairly well even if 
organic sales in regular supermarkets are slumping 
in the last five years weve gone from a fad to a clear market 
niche said bob scowcroft executive director of the california 
certified organic farmers the establishment of national 
standards will allow our growers to compete fairly in all 50 
states

somewhere between smaller chemicalfree 
organic farms and giant corporate cultivators that use tons of 
pesticides a year is an idea thats getting a lot of attention 
the professionals call it lowinput sustainable agriculture 
what it means is using only the chemicals you really need 
in general organic farming requires total abstinence from 
chemical fertilizers or pest control sustainable agriculture 
provides a way to cut back on chemicals through better soil 
monitoring technology mechanical weed control crop rotation and 
whats known as integrated pest management 
sound reasonable 
some parts of the agriculture industry are being dragged along 
kicking and screaming they say that thanks to fertilizers and 
pesticides a single acre can produce several times the crops of 
the same acre 40 years ago 
furthermore say farmers interviewed by investigators for 
congress general accounting office the governments subsidy 
programs discourage the sustainable approach by linking payments to 
certain crop yields that require chemicals to be maintained 
this means that unless the law is changed farmers will continue 
to push for high production of cotton soybeans corn and wheat 
year after year even though these crops are associated with soil 
erosion and the chemicals used on them are damaging ground water in 
some states 
we must encourage farmers to combine responsible stewardship 
of natural resources with farm profitability sen charles 
grassley riowa said during debate on the 1990 farm bill but 
we cannot ignore the bottom line in agriculture any more than you 
can ignore the bottom line in any business 
grassley tried unsuccessfully to change language in the 1990 
farm bill calling for reduced chemical use 
the senate bill approved july 27 authorizes 40 million a year 
to pursue sustainable agriculture programs provide material to 
farmers who want to learn more about the methods and requires 
extension agents to take courses so they can teach farmers about 
it 
and new provisions allow for slightly more crop rotation 
the house bill approved aug 1 has similar language 
jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association said his organization is not opposed to sustainable 
agriculture 
we are part of the mix said vroom we dont think farmers 
should just use our products without looking for other things 
garth youngberg director of the institute for alternative 
agriculture says farmers eventually will have little choice but to 
pursue sustainable methods 
we no longer can concentrate solely on producing more he 
said we didnt have data on ground water 10 years ago we have a 
lot of that now its getting to the point where people see that we 
really have a problem here

one quiet step at a time the democratic party 
chairman has been trying to tailor presidential nominating rules 
that might just fit a winner for a change now he envisions an 
oldfashioned new look in 1992 one in which he and other party 
leaders would screen the candidate field coaxing strong democrats 
in and perhaps urging divisive ones out 
it is a role with some risk said democratic national 
chairman ronald h brown understating the case it also is a role 
reversal since browns last candidate client was jesse jackson in 
1988 when he helped negotiate party rules that went in the 
opposite direction 
actually the turnabout may give him options his predecessors 
didnt have as the first black chairman of a national party and a 
1988 jackson manager brown can hardly be accused of trying to rig 
the system against jackson now that he seeks a major role in 
trying to shape the process in 1992 
i think youve got to do it in concert with democratic members 
of the house and senate and governors and old hands at politics 
in this country brown said in an interview i think frankly 
maybe some major financial supporters of candidates may have to be 
involved 
to political veterans that sounds familiar thats the way it 
used to be done before the democrats overhauled their process in 
the name of reform and took away the clout of the political 
professionals 
in the 20 years since theyve lost four out of five 
presidential elections thats not all due to the system as brown 
said there are a lot of reasons that are not related to the 
process at all 
but it hasnt helped 
before reform the presidntial primaries were a testing ground 
in which presidential candidates would try to show their strength 
far from home to show party leaders and delegates that they could 
be november winners now the primaries are the arena in which 
nominees are chosen there were 36 of them in 1988 
that preliminary competition tends to force candidates toward 
the left and to lock them into positions that can be liabilities 
in the final campaign for the white house 
democratic rules also tend to keep candidates in the race 
because nominating delegates must be assigned in proportion to 
primary election showings losers get their weekly share and an 
early decision on the nominee is almost impossible to gain 
what id like to do is get a consensus candidate early in 
the process and start running against george bush rather than 
against each other brown said 
brown said he doesnt want to go back to the smokefilled room 
but he does want pragmatic commonsense politics 
those have not been democratic hallmarks they werent showing 
in atlanta in 1988 when the winner michael dukakis agreed to 
rules concessions for 1992 in order to gain the backing of the 
loser jackson 
brown as jacksons convention manager helped fashion that 
unity pact brown as party chairman has changed much of it 
the democrats had set aside a bloc of convention seats and 
therefore nominating votes for elected officials and party 
leaders free of commitments to any candidate that reserved some 
muscle for the old guard at jacksons behest the number of 
uncommitted superdelegates was to have been cut next time he 
wanted more power in the primaries and he also wanted something 
close to pure proportional representation without the requirement 
that a candidate get 15 percent of a states votes to win any of 
its delegates 
a year ago the democratic national committee voted to seat a 
full roster of 303 superdelegates at the 1992 convention and 
reinforced the 15 percent threshold for candidates to gain primary 
election delegates meeting this month the committee added another 
80 appointed delegates for 1992 
thats been done without controversy the steps brown now 
envisions are an invitation to controversy and he knows it people 
who think they ought to be president are not inclined to leave the 
field quietly because party leaders tell them to or suggest to 
their supporters and donors that its time to quit theyre more 
likely to start protesting that kingmakers and bosses are trying to 
force them out 
you would have to do it very carefully brown said we 
still have a caucus and primary system where the voters are the 
final arbiters this is not going to be a hamhanded approach

while computer scientists consider ways to 
make americans more computer literate a university professor is 
trying to make americas computers literate 
teaching computers to read involves teaching them to think 
like humans by learning from experience and making educated 
guesses but what most people learn easily at age 6 is proving far 
more difficult for computers 
humans dont just do character recognition we dont just look 
at one thing said sargur srihari a professor at the state 
university of new yorks buffalo campus its going to be many 
many years before computers can read documents such as handwritten 
letters 
for now srihari and his team of about 30 assistants would be 
satisfied if the computer could read the addresses on the envelopes 
those letters came in so would the postal service which is 
supporting their project with a 21 million grant 
the central post office in buffalo for example must sort up to 
33 million pieces of mail a night its existing equipment could 
process up to 42000 letters an hour if the addresses were 
perfectly printed but those machines reject more than 30 percent 
of the mail as unreadable said dennis wnuk a postal operations 
officer in buffalo 
primarily what our optical character readers can read is 
businesstype mail preprinted mail wnuk said the average 
piece of mail that a residential customer will put into a 
collection box well only read about 25 percent of those and 
thats only if he prints very well or happens to have a 
typewriter 
business mail is also a problem if it comes in a gaudily printed 
envelope if the address is too high or if it is folded so that 
part of the letter shows through the window along with the address 
said john gullo an automation and readability specialist at the 
post office 
people who use printers they dont like to change the ribbon 
because they want to get every last address out of the ribbon that 
gives us trouble he said 
the first major problem facing sriharis team is to find the 
address itself simple for humans but bewildering for computers 
that must separate the address from the noise on such things as 
magazine covers and junkmail envelopes 
the suny computer zeroes in on text blocks with the proper shape 
those with lines flush to the left for example and has already 
achieved a 90 percent success rate 
next the computer must figure out as much of the written 
address as possible 
to recognize a 2 for example a computer could be taught to 
look for ends in the top center and lower right a curve in the 
upper right and a sharp v bend in the lower left said alan 
commike a graduate student who is handling the numberrecognition 
aspect of the project 
the problem is that there are so many different ways to write 
numerals that 130 of those rules are needed to sort them all out 
there are twos with holes or loops instead of points 
commike said there are fives with hats fives without hats 
there are british sevens and american sevens 
the next step is to teach the computer to make educated guesses 
to fill in unreadable blanks for example if the street address is 
not entirely legible the computer narrows it to a few 
possibilities by matching the part it can read against a list of 
all strees and numbers in that particular zip code 
this is what is called using contextual information 
bringing knowledge to bear which is what people do srihari 
said 
sriharis computers can now read about 75 percent of handwritten 
zip codes current postal equipment can read only about 5 percent 
of them but the new process is painfully slow up to a minute for 
each piece of mail 
speeding it up will require specially designed hardware and is 
18 months or more away he said 
the researchers are testing their equipment with the real thing 
we had a team of undergraduates working nights in the buffalo 
post office srihari said we didnt delay anybodys mail we 
just took it for a few minutes captured it and put it in our 
database 
eventually srihari said the technology will have a variety of 
applications for example a busy newspaper reader could feed his 
paper into the computer which would cull out only those stories of 
interest to him office workers could do the same with memos 
similar videotex systems were never very successful and the 
prediction that computers would eventually create a paperless 
office was wrong if anything computers have made offices even 
more papery 
srihari said his project could someday give people the best of 
both worlds they could have their paper and computerize it too 
people are not going to get away from hard copy people like 
to have hard copy he said its something tangible its nice 
to be able to take it somewhere

ramesh jain is building a computer 
database so complicated it might seem like childs play 
the university of michigan researcher says his work is too early 
in development to predict its success but it will debunk the myth 
that a computer database has to consist of words or numbers 
how about pictures 
most existing computers recognize only keyboard symbols not 
images that are scanned into their memory 
the computer we are designing will do that jain said you 
can ask questions about pictures using pictures its just the 
research of a new area all the databases are not in terms of names 
or numbers theyre in shapes 
jain director of the schools artificial intelligence lab said 
the program could eventually be used in classrooms police labs 
real estate offices and museum warehouses 
in class for example students could use databases to identify 
leaves in botany education a tree leaf they couldnt identify 
could likely be matched by the computer comparing it to shapes 
colors sizes and textures in its memory 
karen brady an artist in the schools multimedia lab is using 
a sample database with pictures of oriental rugs a computer 
scanner copies the image of each rug into the computers memory 
the computer is programmed to recognize rug features including 
overall design patterns of the main and minor borders and color 
schemes sample rugs can be identified by the computer by matching 
them with such features in its memory 
the amount of information requires huge amounts of computer 
memory jain said he is starting the project on apple macintoshes 
but expects to graduate to larger systems 
some existing databases are based on images but none works 
directly with the pictures jain said 
at the michigan state police crime laboratory in east lansing 
unidentified fingerprints from crime scenes can be matched to 
suspects through images in police files 
but the program does not exclusively work with the images said 
robert slick a latent fingerprint examiner at the lab instead 
the computer assigns numerical values to characteristics of the 
fingerprint and searches the values in its memory for a match 
depending on the level of technology hes using it could be 
used in other areas as well slick said i would think that it 
could even be used in the identification of people thats pure 
speculation but the skys the limit in technology 
jim blackaby acting executive director of the museum computer 
network in syracuse ny says image storage is important to 
museums because it saves wear and tear on collections 
by having images on file researchers can call them up on the 
screen instead of pulling them out of storage 
while copies of paintings and sculptures already are filed on 
computers they cannot be retrieved by specifying an image without 
the key word that describes it blackaby said

alzheimers victims who suffer behavioral 
problems such as paranoia and hallucinations tend to live about two 
years less than those who do not according to a published report 
a shortened lifespan also was associated with hearing loss and a 
later onset of the disease the university of washington 
researchers reported in the annals of internal medicine 
the study confirmed earlier findings that wandering and falling 
a common problem among alzheimers patients reduces lives by about 
three years 
the report suggests that we should try to improve the quality 
of survival and prevent the excess of disability said the 
studys author dr eric larson 
alzheimers progressively strips a persons ability to deal with 
and understand events and people complete household chores and 
even take care of oneself no cause or cure is known 
according to a recent report by congress office of technology 
assessment about 18 million americans have alzheimers so severe 
that others must care for them constantly an additional 1 million 
to 5 million have mild or moderate dementia 
patients live an average of five to eight years after being 
diagnosed with alzheimers according to the researchers 
the study followed 126 alzheimers patients in their late 70s 
for at least six years several factors including depression use 
of prescription drugs loss of appetite and restlessness did not 
affect the patients survival the study showed 
the scientists said they hope their work will be used to develop 
accurate forecasts of the diseases course 
creighton phelps of the alzheimers disease and related 
disorders association in chicago said the group planned to 
disseminate the study to its chapters 
this information linking behavioral problems to shorter 
survival is something we didnt know before he said

if the chief executive officer of a major 
company ran his business affairs in the same manner as the federal 
government does he would lose his job 
there is almost no question this would be his fate because the 
board of directors answerable to the shareholders would be 
compelled to ask why for example he was unaware of the companys 
poor financial condition 
and he wouldnt have a good answer 
they would ask why he made decisions based on inaccurate 
information why his flow of information was inadequate why it 
took so long to assemble why he failed to take action until months 
after the problems had become crises 
the federal government has fought the problem but it hasnt 
succeeded and elected and appointed officials still must make 
decisions on the basis of insufficient or unreliable information 
in the second quarter based on the best evidence available to 
the commerce department in late july the economy expanded at an 
annual rate of 12 percent weak but still strong enough to 
convince officials to refrain from taking action 
this week three months after the second quarter ended it 
became known to the president that the economy had been failing in 
that period just skirting recession growing at a bare fourtenths 
of a percent 
the white house expressed surprise and concern and michael 
boskin the white house chief economic adviser conceded the 
economy was now on a weaker path than had been known the 
administration halved its earlier projections 
while the federal reserve has its own data retrieval methods by 
means of which it seeks to anticipate and finetune the economic 
direction it too must have been surprised by the tardy news you 
cant foresee with ancient data 
the situation points up the problem of running an economy so 
huge that data cannot be assembled in time to act not only does 
its collection take time but when assembled it is incredibly 
complex making it subject to revision 
it is such a revision that now reveals the apriljune economy 
was tripping on a tightrope rather than steady on its feet as 
officials had believed in spite of fears expressed by private 
economists and business people 
the problem has existed since economic statistics were first 
gathered but it becomes more serious when the economy is walking 
the line between recession and expansion as it is now or when 
efforts are made to fine tune 
fine tuning defined more by the attempt than the 
accomplishment seeks to deal with the economy over shorter periods 
of time than is usually the case by the month or even week for 
example rather than the quarter or the year 
in the federal reserves area of authority it would mean keeping 
an especially close watch among other things on the money supply 
and interest rates which of course rely on accurate measurements 
of economic activity 
generally speaking economists both in and out of government 
have no choice but to use official statistics in analyzing business 
and economic conditions but some privatesector economists have 
recently complained about inaccuracies 
some in fact have devised their own computeraided techniques 
for gathering and analyzing information hoping to make themselves 
less reliant on the official statistics 
the latest revision however is an extremely critical one that 
presents a brand new perspective and forces changes in forecasts 
throughout government and industry and it will add to the 
complaints

lessons learned in the 1973 arab oil embargo have 
helped japan weather the gulf crisis even though danger lurks in 
the form of plummeting stock prices and rising interest rates 
nearly two months after iraq invaded kuwait gasoline prices are 
up only slightly in japan and there is little sign of the grave 
concern that might be expected from a country that relies on the 
middle east for 70 percent of its oil 
thats largely a result of the governments efforts to avoid a 
repeat of 1973 when japans economy was thrown into chaos through 
arab restrictions of oil exports and imports that tripled in price 
within months 
at the time the oil shock sent inflation spiraling and led 
to the first decline in japans gross national product during the 
postwar era 
japanese recall how they rushed to stores to buy toilet paper 
kerosene and other commodities amid fears of shortages the crisis 
atmosphere was heightened by emergency conservation measures that 
pulled the plug on neon lighting and closed gasoline stations on 
holidays and sundays 
but there have been no such scenes this time around 
the major reason is that the government has a deliberate 
policy of not causing panic said gregory clark a professor at 
sophia university specializing in the japanese economy that policy 
is aimed at dampening expectations of inflation 
japanese ministries have kept a close eye on companies plans to 
raise fuel prices to the consumer oil wholesalers have raised 
prices only once during the crisis and only after the government 
demanded they narrow the increase 
meanwhile the powerful ministry of international trade and 
industry on tuesday asked wholesalers of liquefied petroleum gas to 
absorb higher costs by streamlining operations and limiting price 
increases to the minimum the kyodo news service reported 
japan is also less vulnerable to another oil shock because 
it has reduced its dependence on foreign oil for its overall energy 
needs from about 75 percent to under 60 percent according to a 
western energy analyst 
for further protection the country has built up a 144day 
reserve of oil japan also has been purchasing additional supplies 
from saudi arabia and iran since the international embargo on iraq 
and kuwait began in early august 
so far we have enough supply and enough stock to cover the 
loss so i dont think we have serious problems in the short run 
said hideki matsumoto a senior economist at the private institute 
of energy economics japan 
he said the government may draw from that stockpile in winter 
when demand for petroleum products increases 
in the longer term however continuing uncertainty in the gulf 
and sharply increased oil prices pose threats to the worlds no 2 
economy so strong that it has grown each month for nearly four 
years 
the stock market which was already bearish has slid 28 percent 
since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait on wednesday the 225share 
nikkei stock average dropped 475 percent to end the day at 
2225062 its lowest closing level since jan 5 1988 
japanese commercial banks with their large share portfolios 
have been hit particularly hard the reduced value of those assets 
rendered some banks unable to meet international reserve 
requirements that become mandatory in two years analysts say this 
could lead to reduced lending overseas 
economists are particularly worried about accelerated interest 
rate growth and inflationary pressure since the crisis began 
retail costs of petroleum products are likely to increase in 
larger and more frequent increments if the crisis persists the 
real blow will be the price hike of petroleumrelated products 
which will surface before the end of the year predicted josen 
takahashi chief economist at the mitsubishi research institute 
perhaps most ominous is the possible effect of rising interest 
rates on the expensive japanese realestate market 
although japan is only 4 percent the size of the united states 
its real estate is estimated at nearly four times the total value 
of us real estate about 15 trillion land prices climbed 13 
percent in the 12 months ending in july according to one government 
survey 
some analysts believe the interest rate increases could force 
land speculators to sell their holdings and burst the real estate 
bubble 
a collapse of the real estate market said clark would have 
staggering effects on this economy and could lead to a lengthy 
recession 
so far said clark the government has done well to avert the 
inflationary scare of the 1973 oil shock 
what they cant control is the period over which interest 
rates remain high he added and this is whats going to make 
or break this economy

even dissident united auto workers members seem 
to like the unions new deal with general motors corp making 
ratification of the threeyear contract a virtual certainty 
a suburban detroit uaw local active in the new directions 
movement which voiced the only organized opposition to the gmuaw 
contract voted overwhelmingly wednesday to ratify the pact 
this is the first one weve ratified in nine years said 
howard farnsworth a shop committeeman at uaw local 594 at gms 
truck amp bus group plant in pontiac 
his local which voted to reject tentative agreements in 1984 
and 1987 approved the 1990 agreement 77 percent to 23 percent 
finally we get to ratify one here at 594 farnsworth said 
voting on the proposed agreement which contains three years of 
income guarantees for about 300000 gm workers continues through 
the weekend some large locals at assembly and stamping operations 
scheduled votes for today tonight and friday 
other locals approved the contract by much wider margins than 
did local 594 
production workers at local 276 at gms assembly plant in 
arlington texas for example approved the contract by a 98 
percent margin and workers at local 549 at gms stamping plant in 
marion ind approved the contract on a 95 percent vote 
the union said it would release results at the end of the month 
after ballots from all 155 locals at gm plants are counted 
after the gmuaw pact is ratified the union will announce 
whether it will resume bargaining next with ford motor co or 
chrysler corp uaw contracts with the big three automakers 
covering more than 450000 active workers expired at midnight 
sept 14 although provisions of the agreements have been extended 
meantime the canadian auto workers union on wednesday set an 
oct 10 deadline for reaching a new contract with general motors of 
canada ltd on sunday the union said its 12800 members ratified a 
new threeyear contract with ford of canada after a oneweek 
strike 
the two unions which split in 1985 say the contract they reach 
first will be used as a pattern for agreements with other 
automakers 
uaw members contacted this week have said one of the big selling 
points was a gm promise to pay up to 4 billion to guarantee wages 
for workers laid off more than 36 weeks during the next three 
years 
other apparently wellreceived contract provisions include 
health care benefits that stay the same and increases in pension 
plans 
the uaw had tapped job security as its top issue guaranteeing 
income is seen as the next best thing to guaranteeing jobs 
anytime you guarantee every soul in gm a job or income for 
three years its good said oscar bunch president of local 14 
at gms hydramatic plant in toledo ohio

the two german economies the juggernaut and 
the wheelchair have little to do with each other three months 
after they merged 
its a big disappointment for those who believed capitalism 
would bring benefits and progress to the east soon after economic 
union occurred on july 1 
instead there has been little investment in east germany many 
businesses have failed and there has been a tidal wave of 
unemployment east german industrial production in july was a 
whopping 42 percent below july 1989 
but german economic officials and analysts think things are 
fine that the problems were inevitable 
the conditions for further growth in germany are 
extraordinarily good said peter pietsch an economist with 
commerzbank one of west germanys leading banks 
pietsch thinks the only problem for the german economy these 
days is the persian gulf crisis meaning possibly higher oil 
prices 
the bundesbank the west german central bank said in its 
monthly report released sept 18 that there had been continued 
economic growth in west germany since july 1 
depressing effects of the gulf crisis and slackening demand in 
export markets were more than compensated for by the swift 
expansion of 40 
mayor brad cabanas town council has voted not to collect or pay 
the gst come what may 
its another example of government not listening to the 
people he said its not a fair tax and its quite

developer olympia and york has attracted tenants 
to its canary wharf center using such aggressive inducements as 
buying a tenants current building and assuming others leases 
sources said 
questions about how canary wharf is faring were raised by the 
recent decision of olympia and yorks owners the reichmann family 
of toronto to sell a 20 percent stake in their vast us 
properties 
canary wharf expected to cost 4 billion pounds 75 billion 
is olympia and yorks biggest project ever it is europes largest 
office development and boasts britains tallest building 
outside real estate agents are divided about whether the project 
will prove successful they agreed that it is a risky one because 
of its huge size and its untried hardtoreach location 
the 71acre project is 25 miles east of the city of london or 
financial district it is part of the sprawling docklands 
development on the river thames 
its not being helped by a real estate market depressed by 15 
percent interest rates and a slowing economy the agents say 
the aggressive marketing of assuming leases reflects a desire by 
olympia and york to create momentum and prove that the first phase 
of canary wharf will succeed they say 
its basically musical chairs its all right as long as the 
music doesnt stop said john phillips a property agent with the 
firm gooch and wagstaff 
olympia and york used such selling techniques in new york in the 
past a canary wharf spokeswoman confirmed 
the developer took over the project three years ago when an 
original consortium including the investment firms morgan stanley 
and first boston pulled out because of lack of expertise and 
funding for such a large project she said 
the reichmanns decision to sell interest in some of its 
holdings reported last week has nothing to do with canary 
wharf said the canary wharf spokeswoman who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the developer is pleased with the progress in signing up 
clients she said 
olympia and york said last week that a 500 millionpound 935 
million financing package for canary wharf will be completed soon 
the project so far has been funded with developers own resources 
and canadian bank credit lines 
olympia and york views canary wharf as a longterm investment 
the spokeswoman said the company has never failed to complete a 
project she said 
i think it will be successful eventually said robert 
foster a partner with the real estate firm weatherall green and 
smith 
but phillips said i think the whole project is very much at a 
stage where its questionable in viability terms even olympia amp 
york with their financial assets its beginning to test even 
their resources its such a big expensive project 
thirteen tenants including morgan stanley american express 
and manufacturers hanover have signed up to fill 25 million 
square feet of the 43 million square feet available in the first 
phase the first buildings open in 1991 
olympia and york plans to build 10 million square feet of office 
space in five phases over as long as 10 years 
theyve been succeeding in attracting tenants to a greater 
extent than the market expected said peter rose another agent 
with gooch and wagstaff however other players in the market 
havent been used to the aggressive tactics that theyve used 
although the canary wharf spokeswoman said the company doesnt 
discuss the details of its tenancy agreements she confirmed that 
the developer has bought the daily telegraphs nearby building in 
exchange for the newspaper taking space in canary wharf 
olympia and york has offered to assume prospective clients 
leases said a source at a company which has negotiated with the 
developer he spoke on condition of anonymity 
another such source said one of the things they have done 
which is very smart is to offer to take over peoples leases and i 
know they have done that in a couple of cases 
he said his company was offered low rent an outfitting 
allowance and a long fixed term without a rent review which he 
called usual inducements for a new development 
foster said canary wharf is offering space at a very good 
rent of 30 pounds 56 a square foot compared with 50 pounds 
94 in the city

some oil and gas companies are rushing to take 
advantage of higher oil prices to increase drilling but many say 
theyve learned the hard way that its better to wait out the 
latest persian gulf crisis 
two companies arkla exploration of shreveport la and 
houstonbased conoco a dupont subsidiary announced this month 
they were boosting their domestic exploration budgets 
but independent producers and other oil and gas companies said 
in interviews wednesday they dont believe prices are going to stay 
high enough long enough for them to risk millions of dollars in new 
drilling 
a lack of trust in the pricing situation keeps us in place 
until we stop staring at each other across the kuwait border 
said julian martin executive vice president of the texas 
independent producers and royalty owners association in austin 
oil prices have been rising since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
with light sweet crude nearly double preinvasion prices at almost 
40 per barrel 
conoco announced earlier this month it was boosting its domestic 
exploration budget by 10 million the first major energy company 
to respond to the recent price increases with more spending 
officials said the money would cover the cost of five new wells in 
the gulf of mexico 
with the literal dismantling of the exploration infrastructure 
in the us during recent years this country cant expect to see a 
significant increase in exploratory activity right away said max 
pitcher conocos executive vice president for worldwide 
exploration 
but while this single effort will not lessen us dependence 
on overseas oil right away it is a step in the right direction 
he said 
arkla which drills primarily for natural gas announced last 
week it has increased its capital budget for the remainder of 1990 
from 55 million to 70 million a nearly 30 percent jump over what 
it originally planned to spend this year 
we are doing something aggressive company spokesman louis 
resweber said the industry has to step up to the plate and 
assist in finding a domestic energy source when were being 
threatened by the middle east 
but martin and independent producers said it was too risky to 
increase drilling with expectations of 40perbarrel oil and 
suddenly be stuck holding 10perbarrel oil 
even if a real war breaks out and oil goes up to 60 a barrel 
it would be risky to increase drilling said houston oilman 
michel halbouty nobodys going to spend a lot of money then 
watch the price plummet 
most independents were burned in 1985 and 1986 tipros 
martin said they fear the same phenomenon will occur again if 
they start projecting higher prices for a long time 
martin added however that some independents are using the 
increase in internal cash flows to rework existing wells and are 
increasing production in developed leases others he said are 
saving the money to increase drilling budgets in the next few 
months if it becomes clear that oil prices will stay up for a 
relatively long time 
but for now your friendly bank and traditional investors are 
unwilling to get into such an uncertain venture martin said 
other natural gas companies including mesa ltd partnerships in 
amarillo and mitchell energy and development corp in houston said 
they also were waiting to see how the persian gulf crisis shapes up 
before increasing drilling 
the more ominous it gets the more people are tempted to stick 
their necks out said tony lentini of mitchell energy but 
theyre taking the risk that without a price floor the saudis 
could flood the market 
lentini also said the company was beginning to turn just a 
little bit toward oil production because of demands for domestic 
oil

here are excerpts from a prosecution memorandum 
to us district judge kimba m wood outlining the governments 
full case against michael milken and urging the judge to severely 
sentence him

milkens crimes formed a pattern of calculated fraud deceit and 
corruption of the highest magnitude in a highly sophisticated and 
systematic way milken endeavored to enhance his power and enlarge 
his wealth by willingly cheating clients manipulating the 
marketsand evading the laws and rules designed to safeguard the 
investing public 
milken developed and nurtured corrupt relationships with 
numerous clients and customers including ivan f boesky the 
prominent wall street arbitrageur and john doe an institutional 
money manager together with these criminal associates milken 
harnessed the vast economic power of drexel burnham lamberts 
highyield department and directed it to enhance his power and 
increase his wealth the highyield department became the means 
through which milken rewarded his friends defeated his rivals and 
committed his crimes 
contrary to milkens persistent efforts to minimize the 
nature and scope of his criminal conduct the six charges to which 
milken pleaded guilty provide but a sampling of the larger pattern 
of criminal activity that permeated milkens operation of the 
highyield department 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in our view three primary reasons mandate that milken be 
severely punished for his crimes first milkens criminal conduct 
as reflected by his guilty plea was sweeping it warrants the 
imposition of a substantial term of imprisonment 
second notwithstanding his entry of a guilty pea milken has 
scarcely accepted responsibility for his crimes he has done little 
to mitigate his punishment 
finally milkens sentence will be used in criminal courts 
throughout this country as the model for how our justice system 
should treat whitecollar criminals this courts message must be a 
clarion call to the community that financial crime cannot be 
countenanced and will not be tolerated 
put simply milkens crimes were crimes of greed 
arrogance and betrayal

poised atop the drexel financial colossus milken routinely 
possessed more power and better information than his clients 
customers and the market 
on certain occasions milken engendered the loyalty of his 
customers by abetting their crimes and violations on other 
occasions milken unlawfully provided gratuities often in the 
form of valuable investment opportunities available only to those 
designated by him to personally enrich institutional fiduciaries 
in order to influence them to direct their institutional business 
to drexel the net result of these corrupt practices was the 
creation of a marketplace rife with conflicts of interest and 
manipulative conduct 
contrary to his efforts to characterize the crimes he 
committed as petty milkens crimes were neither technical nor 
victimless they included the fraudulent misappropriation of funds 
from unsophisticated investors who entrusted their funds to the 
management of others the deception of market participants who 
acted in reliance on the integrity of the marketplace and contempt 
for the legal framework designed to protect such investors and 
ensure the integrity of the market 
milkens criminal conduct was calculated and systematic 
rather than gratuitous and aberrational and milkens criminal 
activity was a significant and necessary component of the growth of 
his power in the highyield market

milken merits scant credit for accepting responsibility and no 
credit for cooperation milkens decision reflects surrender 
not contrition further milken has not accepted responsibility for 
all of his crimes indeed his selfserving rationalizations to the 
probation department undercut any serious claim that he has truly 
accepted responsiblity for even the crimes to which he has now 
pleaded finally in spite of his many postinvestigation social 
and charitable good works milken has not taken and has indicated 
that he will not take affirmative steps to clean up the industry 
he dirtied 
milken should be punished as the unreconstructed and 
unapologetic man that he is

having been responsible for drexels rise to prominence drexel 
might have been milkens to destroy but there is no question that 
the excesses in drexels corporate culture that milken fathered 
hastened the collapse of the company corrupted many young 
professionals and occasioned the loss of thousands of jobs were it 
not for the lawlessness of milkens highyield department there 
would not have been grand jury and sec securities and exchange 
commission investigations even after the investigations 
moreover the greedy habits of the milken years led to the payment 
of tens of millions of dollars in 1989 bonuses and compensation as 
drexel spiraled towards bankruptcy had more money been kept in 
drexel rather than paid out to milken and other members of the 
highyeild department drexel undoubtedly would have had a greater 
chance to survive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the absurdity of milkens claimed disinterest in wealth is 
demonstrated by his direct compensation from drexel and his 
indirect compensation through drexel milkens compensation from 
drexel represented an enormous percentage of drexels bottom line 
a footnote showed the escalation of his compensation to 550 
million in 1986 or 458 percent of drexels operating profit his 
compensation of 316 million in 1987 was estimated at 817 percent 
of the companys operating profit according to the government 
as one former employee put it milken never let go of a 
nickel except to get a better grip

between 1983 and march 1986 drexel raised over 800 million for 
the boesky organization through the sale of highyield securities 
these financings culminated in march 1986 when drexel and milken 
raised 660 million for the boesky organization 
this mutually beneficial relationship between boesky and milken 
evolved over time into a corrupt one in which each engaged in 
unlawful conduct to benefit the other the secret boesky 
relationship also allowed milken to invest in lucrative trading 
opportunities which he was legally barred from because of drexels 
involvement in certain corporate finance transactions 
in may 1986 dennis levine a prominent merger and 
acquisition specialist then employed by drexel was arrested for 
insider trading the levine arrest struck a weighty blow in the 
investment community more particularly it was an ominous event 
for boesky because of his own illegal dealings with levine and 
for milken because the arrest signaled a greater law enforcement 
vigilance in the investment banking area following the 
levine arrest unlawful trading in the highyield department 
slowed 
more particularly the levine arrest affected the course of the 
unlawful milkenboesky relationship in july 1986 boesky visited 
milken for the purpose of discussing a range of business items 
both lawful and unlawful during the course of a poolside 
discussion between milken and boesky at milkens home the two 
discussed the effect of levines arrest on their unlawful dealings 
 
boesky and milken did not meet again until october 1986 
shortly after the announcement of boeskys plea and settlement with 
the government john doe asked milken if he had been careful 
in his october 1986 meeting with boesky milken answered that he 
thought he had been careful but that he was not entirely sure that 
he had been careful enough john does fears were justified

during the period form 1984 through 1986 drexel was at the 
center of wall streets takeover boom clients came to drexel for 
the most part because of drexels unmatched ability to raise 
capital through the sale of highyield securities 
there is substantial evidence that milken caused drexel to 
buy and sell securities based upon material nonpublic information 
misappropriated from certain drexel clients in one of these 
instances milken traded on insider information for his own

milkens submission dramatically exposes the gulf between his 
crimes and his conviction on the one hand and his continuing 
agitprop on the other milken has been convicted of serious and 
sweeping crimes his good works however commendable should not 
shield him from incarceration he should be sentenced to a 
substantial term of imprisonment 
milken is selling an old and threadbare story by focusing 
the courts attention on the five specific crimes he had admitted 
and by wholly ignoring his conviction on a broad conspiracy charge 
milken is attempting to minimize his criminal conduct were 
milken to address the true range of his crimes however even he 
would have to acknowledge a different conclusion milkens crimes 
were serious and extensive 
 
</TEXT>

milken has been convicted of enormously serious crimes 
conspiracy to violate the laws of the united states securities 
fraud mail fraud wire fraud tax fraud and recordkeeping and 
reporting violations 
although he has limited his allocution to five separate 
acts in furtherance of that conspiracy this court can and should 
sentence milken for all of his crimes 
in united states v kittel kittel a member of the 
new york chapter of the hells angels motorcycle club was charged 
with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute large quantities of 
methamphetamine and with 11 substantive counts relating to the 
unlawful distribution of methamphetamine he was convicted on his 
plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge and to one of the 
distribution charges in kittels sentencing however the 
government alleged that kittel had participated in the murder and 
dismemberment of another hells angels club member and the unlawful 
manufacture of an explosive device among other acts of violence 
judge pierre leval sentenced kittel to a 14year term of 
imprisonment stating that the sentence was based not only the 
particular offenses to which kittel had pleaded guilty but on the 
governments evidence of kittels unadmitted crimes persistent 
drug dealing and acts of violence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
moreover although the government is asking the court to 
sentence milken on crimes more numerous than he has specifically 
admitted these additional charges are similar to the crimes that 
milken has admitted manipulating stocks unlawfully influencing 
corporate events through the concealed ownership of securities 
unlawfully providing benefits to clients and client representatives 
in order to cultivate their business and fraudulently 
misappropriating funds from clients 
indeed milkens agreement to pay 200 million in criminal 
penalities and 400 million in restitution dramatically belies both 
his contention that he committed only the five enumerated crimes 
and his argument that even these crimes were aberrational and 
technical violations these fines penalties and restitution fix 
the scope of milkens criminal conduct milkens agreement to pay 
these monies stands out as the most reliable measure of his 
criminal conduct 
for all these reasons this case is sharply different from 
united states v freeman in freeman where the judge refused 
to admit a sentencing report on additional crimes the defendant 
pleaded guilty to one narrow insider trading charge not to 
multiple offenses and a broad conspiracy charge unlike milken 
robert freeman did not acknowledge the governments right to put 
before the court his unadmitted offenses unlike milken 
freeman in his allocution did not admit that he committed crimes 
additional to the crimes to which he specifically pleaded guilty 
finally freeman did not agree to pay criminal fines and 
restitution penalties of 600 million

milken should be sentenced to a substantial period of 
incarceration commensurate with his crimes those crimes were 
pervasive and systemic they were committed for venal reasons to 
enhance milkens personal power and increase his wealth no good 
works undertaken by milken mitigate the imperative of a substantial 
prison term milkens proposal that he be sentenced to a 
probationary term and community service is absurd such a sentence 
would eviscerate law enforcements efforts to police and deter 
financial crime 
milkens crimes have had nationwide impact and his 
sentence will become the touchstone for every sentence for 
financial crime in the country 
other sentences demonstrate a consensus among judges that 
absent significant actual cooperation a major securities law 
violator such as milken will receive a substantial term of 
incarceration 
boeskys threeyear term of incarceration provides a useful 
point of departure as an initial symbolic matter milken stands 
convicted of six times as many felony charges as boesky and has 
agreed to pay six times boeskys criminal fine and civil penalty 
while the government does not suggest that simple arithmetic should 
determine milkens sentence milkens suggestion that facing 
almost six times boeskys penalty he merits a fraction of his 
punishment is preposterous

like boesky and levine milken committed very serious crimes 
unike boesky and levine however milken has not cooperated on the 
urging of the government boesky and levine each received reduced 
sentences because of their extraordinary assistance in the 
successful prosecutions of others 
boeskys cooperation resulted directly and indirectly in 
the successful prosecution of numerous prominent securities 
industry professionals in addition to milken in sharp contrast 
during the four years of boeskys cooperation milken has 
vigorously contested the governments charges and allowed the 
statute of limitations to preclude prosecution of others based on 
any information he could provide 
the sentence of paul bilzerian to four years in prison 
for repeated securities fraud crimes should also inform this 
courts exercise of its sentencing discretion bilzerians sentence 
was based on multiple criminal acts over an extended period of 
time his violations were similar in type to milkens admitted 
crimes though fewer in number milkens conduct is of course 
far more widespread and systemic than bilzerians

committed a range of serious whitecollar crimes unmatched in the 
1980s the government respectfully submits that this court should 
impose a sentence that reflects the full magnitude of milkens 
unlawful conduct and that unmistakably deters others the 
courts sentence must demonstrate that persons who possess great 
wealth and prominence cannot expect that their privilege or their 
money will insulate them from certain and serious punishment

two separate regulators for securities and 
futures markets may be too many as the links between wall street 
and chicago bind the markets together a congressional study has 
concluded 
a study of financial market technology by the congresss office 
of technology assessment suggested creating one regulatory agency 
with responsibility over securities including futures and options 
the report found that dual regulatory agencies may no longer 
be appropriate for what is now one marketplace 
the study scheduled to be made public today could heat up the 
simmering dispute between the rival regulators the securities and 
exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission 
both agencies have engaged in a war of words over which should 
regulate stock index futures and their margins 
stock index futures are futures contracts that allow investors 
to bet on the movement of a whole series of stocks without having 
to buy the underlying securities margins are the downpayments paid 
by investors buying securities on credit securities margins are 
about 50 percent of the stocks value while futures margins are 
usually just 5 percent of the market value 
the 220page report electronic bulls and bears us 
securities markets and inforamtion technology was an outgrowth 
of the 1987 stock market crash 
the study looks at the regulatory structure and says hey 
these are now one market and having two agencies that fight each 
doesnt make any sense said vary t coates project director of 
the study the study also is critical of the specialist system of 
trading at the new york and american stock exchanges 
the ota does not make recommendations to congress but provides 
various policy options officials stressed the options included 
clearer definitions of jurisdiction by congress and setting up a 
multiagency panel with binding decisionmaking authority 
and the one that looks best is to integrate having one 
regulatory agency and this should be reexamined by the congress 
said ms coates commodities trading would be left in the hands of 
a separate regulator 
the report noted that the biggest stumbling block to a merger is 
different congressional committees have jurisdiction over the 
agencies and may not be willing or able to agree to consolidation 
of jurisdiction 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the energy and commerce 
committee that oversees the sec said the panel would look at 
reforming the us regulatory structure which he called 
fragmented and uncoordinated and out of step with the way 
these new electronic bulls and bears run 
the reports finding bolstered a bill proposed earlier this year 
by reps dan glickman dkan and dennis eckart dohio for 
merging the sec and cftc into a unified super regulatory 
agency 
it is gratifying to know that an unbiased and careful analysis 
by an arm of congress has reached the same conclusion that the sec 
has been urging for some time said mary mccue an sec 
spokeswoman 
they have their own opinion its just not what we subscribe 
to said cftc spokesman david gary we feel the markets are 
linked but there is no need for one regulator in fact we remain 
firmly in the camp of functional regulation 
the report also said the sec and cftc often take radically 
different positions on issues and those differences raise 
doubts about the reliability of their coordination and cooperation 
during market emergencies 
earlier this year the heads of both agencies trashed each 
others study of the causes of the 1987 stock market crash 
accusing one another of selfserving interpretation of the same 
data 
in january a draft version of the report drew fire from a 
blueribbon advisory panel that included representatives from 
exchanges in new york and chicago for criticizing the specialist 
system as faltering and possibly irredeemably obsolete 
under the specialist system stock can only be traded through 
certain designated exchange members charged with maintaining an 
orderly market in that security even if it means buying or 
selling the stock because no other takers can be found 
critics claim specialists are unable to keep up with the massive 
volume that occurs in a market crisis like the 1987 crash but 
supporters say specialists stayed at their posts taking orders 
when other traders werent answering their phones during the crash 
while stock exchanges have sophisticated support systems on 
their trading floors they have resisted the use of electronic 
systems for afterhours and remotesite trading said the study 
which found recently announced plans for afterhours trading 
belated cautious and tighly limited 
the report also said the futures markets have resisted 
bringing technology into their domestic trading pits 
most futures exchanges still utilize the boisterous system of 
shouts and hand signals known as open outcry which makes it 
difficult to prevent fraud and assure investors they are getting 
the best price said the ota

laura ashley holdings plc the british clothing 
and home furnishings retailer said thursday it would close seven 
factories and cut 1500 jobs or nearly a fifth of its work force 
the company said the moves were part of an ongoing costcutting 
program it began last year it attributed the closures and cuts to 
a need to counter the effects of a strong british pound and high 
inflation 
the company said it would be left with 6650 workers and two 
manufacturing facilities 
it said 1000 of the job cuts would result from the factory 
closures while the other 500 cuts would come from its worldwide 
retail operations 
if laura ashley is to survive in todays highly competitive 
environment it is no longer viable to source the current level of 
garments worldwide from our uk factories when products of similar 
quality can be obtained at a significantly lower cost from other 
supplies in other countries chairman bernard ashley said 
the company said it would maintain enough inhouse 
garmentmaking capacity to respond to quick changes in market 
needs it said it would continue to print its own fabrics and 
wallpaper and operate its own curtain factory 
the company lost 98 million pounds or 183 million in the 
year ended jan 27 in contrast to a net profit of 84 million 
pounds or 157 million in the previous year

flying is getting safer but more planes in 
the sky will mean more crashes unless the airline industry takes 
action a boeing co study says 
the study also indicates a few simple changes in operations plus 
some relatively inexpensive equipment might help reduce serious 
accidents earl weener boeing commercial airplane groups chief 
engineer for safety said wednesday 
the airplane manufacturer has kept statistics on all free world 
commercial jets for the past 30 years the company predicts the 
worldwide accident rate for jetliners should decline to about 1 per 
million flights in 2005 compared with an average of about 15 per 
million in the past 10 years 
but the number of jets is expected to double in the next 15 
years to about 13000 weener said actual aircraft losses can be 
expected to grow to 20 per year by 2005 up from a yearly average 
of 15 during the past decade 
that means a major air crash every 2 weeks or so something 
that wont sit well with the traveling public no matter how low the 
accident rate is weener said 
if the general public understood rates there wouldnt be a 
state lottery in existence weener said 
boeing which has 60 percent of the worlds commercial jet 
market has been pushing its study among air carriers industry 
groups and government regulators for the past year weener said 
weener who briefed a group of reporters on the study wednesday 
plans to make presentations to carriers and regulators next month 
in europe and southeast asia 
so far boeing has seen a great deal of understanding and 
interest on the part of airlines but its been difficult to 
determine what the results have been weener said this year there 
have been nine hull loss accidents wrecks in which the 
aircraft was destroyed or too badly damaged to fix which 
statistically would make 1990 one of the better years he said 
dave duff spokesman for the federal aviation administration in 
seattle said the agency is looking at the study but hasnt made 
any decisions on it 
the study says investigating agencies found that of the 121 
hullloss accidents in the past 10 years the flight crew was the 
primary cause in 88 accidents or 725 percent 
weener said boeing isnt holding pilots entirely to blame in 
most cases he said the flight crew was only the last party who 
could have prevented the accident in a chain of events boeing 
has used the data to help design aircraft that are more mistake 
tolerant he said 
a spokesman for the air line pilots association was not 
immediately available for comment wednesday but alpa officials 
previously have said they support boeings study 
the study focuses on what might be done to avoid crew error 
especially on takeoffs and landings where nearly 70 percent of 
hullloss accidents occur 
among its recommendations 
install ground proximity warning systems in all jets and 
make sure crews pay attention to them the systems which warn 
pilots to pull up when the ground gets too near have been required 
in us jetliners since 1975 but not in all foreign commercial 
jets 
install instrument landing systems for all runways and 
encourage pilots to use them even in good weather virtually all 
us airports have instrument landing systems but many have them 
on only one runway many foreign airports lack them altogether 
weener said 
make better use of flight data recorders the black boxes 
that monitor flights currently 12 carriers none of them in this 
country use the monitors to review flights and let pilots learn 
what they might have done better weener said airline managers 
have to see the monitors as teaching tools he added

usair group inc the parent of usair has 
suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and postponed 
buying new aircraft 
the company had been paying an annual dividend of 12 cents a 
sharte 
analysts said the carrier is facing losses as high as 350 
million for the year it had an operating loss of 101 million in 
the first half of this year in contrast to an operating proifit of 
258 million in the same period in 1989 
raymond e neidl an analyst for dillon read amp co said the 
dividend suspension was a prudent way to conserve cash 
usair chairman and president edwin i colodny said wednesday the 
board voted to suspend the stock dividend in light of the 
companys recent financial performance and the poor outlook for the 
nations economy and its effect on air travel 
the airline industry has also been battered in recent weeks by 
sharply rising fuel costs in the wake of iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the dividend suspension will save about 35 million annually 
the company said 
the airline however remains liable for 33 million in annual 
dividend payments to berkshire hathaway inc headed by investor 
warren buffett whose company put 358 million into usair preferred 
stock last year 
the company also delayed delivery of 16 new boeing aircraft for 
a year 
earlier this year usair put off taking delivery of 12 boeing 
737 jets from 1991 and 1992 to 1995

the taiwan government lifted restrictions 
thursday on the employment of foreign workers in government 
construction projects 
under the new rule approved by the cabinet contractors can 
apply for the importation of foreign workers for major government 
and special public projects 
currently they can only import up to onethird of the work 
force needed for such construction projects 
officials also said that all foreign workers should be protected 
by taiwans labor laws which stipulate that every worker receive a 
minimum monthly wage of 9750 taiwan dollars or about 357 us 
and be covered by health insurance 
the new move would help boost our economic development said 
chen chungsheng director general of occupational training bureau 
an agency under the labor council 
in 1985 the government announced 14 projects to be completed in 
the early 1990s including highway expansions a major rail line 
and rapid transit system for taipei chen said many of them have 
lagged behind schedule mainly because of the shortage of 
construction workers 
our workers dont like the nonskilled jobs that offer lower 
wages he explained 
earlier this month foreign minister fredrick chien urged the 
government to employ more workers from the philippines indonesia 
and thailand saying the three nations have showed strong interest 
in meeting taiwans labor regulations 
officials said at least 20000 foreigners mostly from southeast 
asia are working illegally in taiwan factories and construction 
sites because of a labor shortage

in a new indication of the escalating economic 
fallout from the persian gulf turmoil the head of the world bank 
said today that he may be forced to call upon rich nations to boost 
their support for the international lending institution by early 
next year 
world bank president barber conable said that if oil prices 
remain at current high levels over the next three months his 
institution would not have enough in existing resources to cushion 
the shock on the world economy 
conables comments represented a change from his position just a 
few days ago at that time he and officials of the banks sister 
lending organization the international monetary fund insisted 
that they could handle the economic impact of the persian gulf 
crisis with available resources without tapping rich countries for 
additional funds 
however as delegates from 154 member countries of the two 
institutions were holding their annual meeting this week the price 
of oil jumped at one point to close to 40 
conable told reporters today that if oil prices stayed at high 
levels into 1991 he believed it would be necessary to ask for 
voluntary contributions from major industrial countries and oil 
producing nations that money would be used to make nointerest 
loans to countries especially hard hit by the rise in oil prices 
and other economic fallouts from the persian gulf turmoil 
if the price of oil stays up and there continues to be turmoil 
and uncertainty and an impact on the global economy clearly it 
will have a major impact on significant parts of the developing 
world conable said 
other officials of the world bank suggested that the proposed 
new lending facility would be available to work with the gulf 
crisis financial coordination group the steering committee of 
donor countries unveiled by president bush in his speech to the 
imfworld bank opening session on tuesday 
officials said that donations raised by the crisis group which 
is headed by treasury secretary nicholast brady might be funneled 
to this new lending facility for distribution to needy countries 
however they stressed that discussions on this matter remained at 
a preliminary stage 
both the imf and world bank had signaled earlier this week that 
they were ready to provide significant economic support to hardhit 
countries endorsing a request made by the bush administration but 
that approval involved the use of existing programs 
the crisis group with officials representing more than 20 
nations held an organizational session wednesday at the us 
treasury 
the united states had hoped to amass commitments this week for 
between 13 billion and 15 billion in aid to turkey jordan and 
egypt those frontline nations have been hard hit by the un 
economic sanctions placed on iraq after its aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
but some european nations objected that the figure was too high 
and that a more realistic amount was 9 billion with 6 billion of 
that support coming from oilrich mideast nations and 3 billion 
from the rest of the world 
following two hours of closeddoor discussions at the us 
treasury officials reported no resolution of the funding question 
also left unresolved were objections voiced to including jordan 
in the assistance package saudi arabia and kuwait have complained 
that jordan is showing reluctance to support the un trade embargo 
and therefore should not get aid 
and some nations raised the question of including other 
especially hardhit nations in the frontline category in addition 
to turkey jordan and egypt 
proponents of a longer list pointed to a new world bank study 
that identified bangladesh india pakistan the philippines sri 
lanka and sudan as seriously hurt by the persian gulf crisis 
us officials said they would not oppose expanding the list of 
most needy nations as long as the list did not grow too long 
one senior treasury official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said many of the unresolved matters should be cleared up 
in discussions by lowerlevel working groups before the full crisis 
coordinating panel meets again on oct 12 
the nations participating with the united states in wednesdays 
meeting included japan west germany britain france canada 
italy saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates qatar and 
south korea 
in addition representatives of belgium the netherlands sweden 
and switzerland were added at the last minute after west germany 
and others argued that the list of potential donor countries needed 
to be expanded 
the us official said however that not all of the 
participating countries had made a commitment to provide financial 
assistance 
representatives from the 12nation european community and the 
gulf cooperation council of persian gulf countries also attended 
the meeting

oil prices advanced today moving briefly past 
the 40abarrel mark for the first time as another round of 
antagonistic statements from iraq overshadowed president bushs 
decision to sell a small part of the governments oil reserves 
the november contract for light sweet crude was up 68 cents at 
3935 a 42gallon barrel at midday on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
earlier in the session the contract rose to 4010 the first 
time the price of oil has traded above 40 
analysts said bushs decision to release 5 million of americas 
590 million barrels of strategic reserves was intended to calm the 
market where prices have doubled since early august 
hes recognized correctly that the battle is taking place in 
the psychological arena said peter beutel an energy market 
analyst with pegasus econometric group inc 
psychology was at work in the market again today 
an iraqi threat to execute us and other diplomats unless they 
hand over westerners theyre sheltering revived trader fears that a 
possible military conflict could disrupt oil supplies from saudi 
arabia 
the threat punctured the brief stability bushs announcement had 
given the market the november contract for crude fell to 3767 in 
early trading before reversing course 
we have not lost any saudi production but the threat of 
losing it is making people constantly nervous beutel said 
in earlier london trading north sea brent blend for november 
delivery was trading at 3675 a barrel down 120 from 
wednesdays close of 3795 a barrel 
bush said the country has sufficient oil to meet current 
needs and added that there is no justification for the 
intensive and unwarranted speculation in oil futures 
one london broker said the announcement has reminded people 
that there are a number of large strategic reserves in the west 
which could be released if this is deemed to be necessary so it 
may calm matters slightly 
paul spedding an oil analyst at the london investment firm 
kleinwort benson ltd said people were beginning to despair 
that the us government would never use its stocks 
it has now been demonstrated there is a restraint mechanism on 
oil prices it is a small but symbolic move he said

jailed savings and loan executive charles h 
keating jr has appealed to the state supreme court for a reduction 
in his 5 million bail 
in his wednesday appeal the former chairman of american 
continental corp said the high bail constitutes cruel and unusual 
punishment 
he also has claimed he cannot legally defend himself properly 
from a jail cell 
keating filed the petition after the states 2nd district court 
of appeal on tuesday rejected his request to reduce the bail 
superior judge gary klausner set for him sept 18 
klausner last week refused to lower the bail saying the charges 
against keating were so serious he might flee 
keating has been charged along with three codefendants in the 
selling of more than 200 million in risky junk bonds to more than 
17000 investors through branches of lincoln savings amp loan 
the bonds became nearly worthless in april 1989 when lincoln was 
seized by federal regulators and american continental its parent 
company filed for bankruptcy 
the codefendants officers of american continental or lincoln 
originally were held on 1 million bail each their individual 
bails were later reduced to 100000 or 200000 and they were 
freed after posting bail 
keatings latest appeal claims the case against him should 
receive the same consideration as those of his codefendants 
keating has declared he is bankrupt and cannot pay the bail his 
attorneys say he is about 5 million in debt and even if his 
children offer their houses as collateral they could only pay 
about 500000 of the bail 
according to court testimony last week keating was worth nearly 
40 million three years ago 
keatings attorneys have said he is not a flight risk arguing 
he has not fled any of more than two dozen civil cases filed 
against him since his firm went to bankruptcy court

the automotive giant fiat said thursday its 
profit before taxes fell 126 percent in the first half of 1990 
despite an 118 percent rise in revenue 
the turinbased company which is owned by the agnelli family 
blamed the earnings drop on increased competition in its key 
markets and the sharp losses of its brazilian subdiaries 
in a statement fiat called the firsthalf results 
satisfactory but said the outlook for the second half was cause 
for concern because some of its sectors are likely to suffer from 
the impact of the gulf crisis on the world economy 
fiat said that the januaryjune period this year its pretax 
profit dropped to 245 trillion lire or 222 billion from 280 
trillion lire or 254 billion a year earlier

lire or 275 billion from 271 trillion lire or 246 billion

italys first antimonopoly law cleared its last 
hurdle thursday 
the industry commission of the italian senate voted unanimously 
to approve the legislation which will bring italy into line with 
regulations laid down recently by the european community 
this decision has enabled us to provide an essential 
instrument to regulate the domestic market in harmony with the 
european community orms said senator robert cassola 
president of the senates industry commission 
the senate approved the law in a brief morning session adding 
no changes to the version already approved by the chamber of 
deputies 
italy was among the last of its european counterparts to pass an 
antitrust law 
the measure is designed to ensure free competition principles 
and prohibit the formation of monopolies or agreements among firms 
that would create dominant market positions 
the legislation isnt likely to have any immediate impact on the 
current concentration of italian industry however 
other than the state monopolies that have formed over the 
years there are very few monopolies in italy said paolo filippo 
lardera italy analyst with ubs phillips and drew in london 
this measure must be viewed in a wider european context 
because italian industry is already disadvantaged with respect to 
the rest of europe in terms of dimension and the fragmentation of 
many sectors lardera said 
under the law an antimonopoly commission will be established 
to enforce the new norms the commission will have authority to 
review cases on its own or on request by the industry ministry 
the most controversial portion of the new law regulates the 
relationship between banks and industry limiting the degree of 
control industrial companies can acquire over the financial sector 
as a result of the new law an industrialist wont be allowed to 
acquire direct or indirect shareholdings of more than 15 percent in 
a bank 
furthermore a company must inform the bank of italy if it takes 
up more than 5 percent of a bank companies will be permitted to 
participate in shareholder syndicates of banks provided they dont 
gain a majority position in the syndicate 
these provisions evolved in an effort championed by the bank of 
italy to safeguard the financial sector from manipulation by 
industrial companies 
although italys 1936 banking law prevents commercial banks from 
taking permanent shareholdings in industry until now there was no 
legislation to prevent companies from acquiring stakes in banks

ing c olivetti amp c spa the office 
equipment manufacturer reported thursday a 41 percent drop in its 
profit before taxes for the first half of 1990 
olivettis chairman and controlling shareholder carlo de 
benedetti blamed the earnings drop on tough market conditions a 
continuing squeeze in profit margins and an unfavorable exchange 
rate for the lira 
the company posted consolidated pretax profit of 609 billion 
lire or 521 million in the first six months of the year down 
from 1026 billion lire or 877 million a year earlier 
revenue rose 58 percent to 4167 trillion lire or 356 
billion 
stagnation in the us computer market a continued slowdown of 
the european market and growing competition by us and japanese 
computer manufacturers all increased pressure on margins the 
company said 
the liras strength against the dollar and european currencies 
hurt olivetti because the bulk of its production costs are in lire 
while 60 percent of its sales are in foreign currency de benedetti 
said 
in fact adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations revenue rose 
88 percent in the first semester he said

a liquidation plan for american continental 
corp formerly led by charles h keating jr is headed toward a 
creditors committee after a nod from a federal judge 
the plans provisions include a 21 million payment by the 
government to creditors disposal of american continentals assets 
and agreement by the government to join lawsuits filed by creditors 
against keating and others 
during a hearing wednesday district judge richard bilby 
indicated he intends to approve the plan with some modifications 
law clerk linda mcnulty said thursday 
the plan now goes to a creditors committee which will revise 
it before returning it to the judge bilby could either approve it 
or order more changes as early as next week ms mcnulty said 
the plan would then be sent to all of the approximately 25000 
creditors both a majority of individual creditors and those 
holding the majority of the 365 million debt must approve the 
plan 
phoenixbased american continental filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in april 1989 the next day its primary 
subsidiary lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
was seized by federal regulators 
in a related ruling wednesday bilby approved the settlement of 
two lawsuits filed by american continental investors both were 
against law firms accused of helping keating deceive investors and 
government regulatory agencies as to the stability of his financial 
empire 
the settlements for a total 243 million will return 10 
percent of what investors are believed to have lost when american 
continental collapsed 
keating and three other former executives of american 
continental or lincoln were indicted in los angeles last week on 
state charges of securities fraud stemming from the sales of junk 
bonds keating remained jailed thursday in lieu of 5 million bond 
pending an oct 5 arraignment although he has appealed to the 
state supreme court to reduce his bail 
the liquidation plan was agreed to by american continental its 
creditors and the resolution trust corp the federal agency that 
took over lincoln after it was seized by regulators 
under the plan american continentals remaining assets last 
valued at 16 million would be disposed of over a threeyear 
period 
the rtc would provide creditors with 21 million immediately 
upon approval of the plan providing creditors with compensation 
ranging up to 21 cents on the dollar 
in return the creditors would drop all claims against lincoln 
savings 11 subsidiaries 
the plan also calls for the rtc to become a party in a series of 
lawsuits against more than 50 defendants including keating other 
former american continental and lincoln officials and numerous 
business associates

sell or close most of its factories and cut its work force by 
onefifth in an effort to survive 
the retailer of english countrystyle womens clothing and home 
furnishings operates nearly 500 stores worldwide 185 of them in 
the united states 
its shops are recognizable by their dark green fronts and 
blackberry sprig motif and are bestknown for their flowerprint 
victorianstyle dresses 
in a drastic switch the company said it decided to largely 
abandon manufacturing its own apparel because it can be bought much 
more cheaply from outside suppliers 
the slimdown is part of a yearold costcutting program it 
said it blamed the strong british pound and high inflation for its 
woes 
seven of its nine factories in britain and ireland will be 
closed or sold and 1500 of its 8150 jobs will go the company 
said 
stock of laura ashley holdings has suffered along with the 
companys fortunes it traded at the equivalent of 112 a share on 
londons stock exchange thursday unchanged from wednesday and 
less than half the price at which investors snapped up the shares 
when the company went public in 1985 
moneylosing laura ashley is not the only troubled british 
retailer many operators have suffered from 15 percent interest 
rates engineered by the government to curb inflation by slowing 
consumer spending the annual inflation rate is running at 106 
percent 
another of britains onetime retailing stars the sock chain 
sock shop international plc fell into the hands of administrators 
earlier this year 
laura ashley said it will retain enough inhouse manufacturing 
to respond to changes in market needs it said it would continue 
printing its own fabrics and wallpaper and making its own 
curtains 
chairman bernard ashley issued a statement saying if laura 
ashley is to survive in todays highly competitive environment 
it could no longer supply its stores worldwide with garments made 
in its british factories 
for years the company had pursued a strategy of being a fully 
integrated retailer by making what it sold 
in late august laura ashley moved to raise cash and inspire 
confidence by selling a 15 percent stake to the japanese retailer 
jusco co for 56 million the ashley family with the ashley 
foundation retained a 59 percent stake 
joan dolier a retail analyst with the london investment firm 
county natwest woodmac said about the latest moves its good 
they have bitten the bullet longterm they had to bring down the 
cost base in order to have a viable continuing business 
brian corris an analyst with barclays de zoete wedd ltd said 
i think its got a long way to go but this abandoning 
manufacturing is obviously a step in the right direction 
mrs dolier blamed the companys difficulties on mismanagement 
it hasnt been a sale problem its been a cost problem she 
said 
the laura ashley look still has appeal mrs dolier said the 
biggest asset the company has is the laura ashley brand there is 
still a lot of goodwill attached to that 
the company which had been expected to report its halfyear 
results this week said they would be released in midoctober 
it lost the equivalent of about 183 million in the year ended 
jan 27 compared with a profit of 157 million the previous year 
sales grew to 555 million from 472 million 
the late laura ashley and her husband bernard began the clothier 
as a small cottage industry in a london apartment 37 years ago 
they printed fabrics on their kitchen table 
the couple expanded into garments accessories wallpaper and 
soft furnishings they opened their first store in 1968 
the welshborn mrs ashley died of head injuries in september 
1985 at the age of 60 after falling down steep stairs at her 
daughters west england home

trading thursday on the chicago board of trade 
wheat futures prices extended wednesdays gains after the 
agriculture department confirmed reports that it has offered to 
sell subsidized flour to the soviet union morocco and other west 
african countries 
none of the countries have made a firm commitment to buy

waiting for that it takes some of the pressure off the market 
soybean futures prices followed wheats lead after the usda also

over the next week such good weather hold prices lower because 
there is no fear of shortages 
the usda grain stocks report also was a factor in the thin 
trading some analysts said but spilka said after the reports 
release at the close of trading that it should have little effect 
on fridays market

said i wouldnt place great emphasis on the report having much 
influence

a federal judge today put off the monday 
sentencing of michael milken and ordered an extraordinary hearing 
to consider the unadmitted crimes alleged by the government against 
the junkbond financier 
us district judge kimba m wood said she would hold a hearing 
in early october for approximately two weeks and give each side 20 
hours to present arguments before pronouncing sentence 
milken pleaded guilty in april to six felonies and faces a 
maximum 28 years in prison for his role in wall streets worst 
financial scandal 
the government had urged the judge to give milken a stiff 
sentence in a presentencing memorandum that outlined a broader 
array of crimes than those milken admitted in his plea bargain 
more than 200 pages of documents detailing those accusations 
were released wednesday by order of the judge 
the defense also had released a mountain of documents refuting 
the governments arguments and suggesting community service as an 
alternative sentence for the fallen billionaire 
federal law allows a judge to consider such evidence before 
passing sentence but must give the defense an opportunity to 
respond 
woods ruling shocked defense attorneys who have wanted to 
proceed wih the sentencing for months 
lead attorney arthur liman said i was hoping we could 
dispense with this 
he said such a hearing would prolong the extraordinary anguish 
and agony for my clients family 
wood tentatively scheduled a conference between the prosecutors 
and milkens lawyers tuesday to further define the extent of the 
extraordinary hearing it was unclear when milken would be 
ultimately sentenced 
milken was not in court 
your purpose should be to shed light on the defendants 
character wood told the opposing lawyers 
woods ruling made it almost certain that milkens chief accuser 
ivan boesky would be called to testify about the extent of his 
relationship with milken 
but lawyers said it was unclear whether milken would be present 
in the courtroom for such proceedings 
in their presentencing memorandum the prosecutors did not 
prescribe a specific sentence for milken but drew a comparison to 
his coconspirator boesky the convicted speculator and informant 
paid 100 million to settle insider trading charges pleaded guilty 
to a felony and was sentenced to a threeyear term now completed 
milken stands convicted of six times as many felony charges as 
boesky and has agreed to pay six times boeskys criminal fine and 
civil penalty the prosecution said 
while the government does not suggest that simple arithmetic 
should determine milkens sentence milkens suggestion that 
facing almost six times boeskys penalty he merits a fraction of 
his punishment is preposterous 
milken one of the nations richest men paid a record 600 
million in penalties as part of his plea agreement 
the governments memo which urged a substantial prison term for 
milken was riddled with allegations of insider trading 
manipulation bribery and hiding evidence by milken going far 
beyond the felonies to which he pleaded guilty but the document 
offered little in the way of new evidence to support the claims 
it also suggsted milkens alleged greed hastened the demise of 
his former employer the nowdefunct junkbond powerhouse of drexel 
burnham lambert inc another victim of the scandal which collapsed 
earlier this year 
contrary to milkens claims of a modest humble life in which 
money was secondary the prosecution said he was obsessed with 
wealth and that his enormous compensation devoured much of drexels 
bottom line

eli lilly amp co said it won approval for a 
new device for treating heart patients with clogged arteries a 
catheter that removes rather than flattens the damaging plaque 
the simpson coronary athercath is the first device that cuts 
captures and removes plaque to gain approval by the us food and 
drug administration lilly officials said 
the catheter is manufactured by devices for vascular 
intervention inc a california company lilly purchased for 50 
million last year 
its an important device it has specific uses and it will add 
to the tools we have available but its not going to sweep 
everything else off the table said bruce f waller a cardiac 
pathologist with the indiana heart institute where doctors helped 
test the device 
clogged arteries currently are treated with a balloon catheter 
which doctors insert into a blood vessel and snake to the 
obstructed site the balloon is expanded flattening the plaque 
against the artery wall and allowing more blood to flow through the 
vessel 
researchers have been working on alternatives to balloon 
catheters in part because about onethird of the patients treated 
that way have partial blockage later however waller said some 
studies indicate blockage recurs in up to 40 percent of patients 
treated with the atherectomy catheter 
because of that waller said the new device often will be used 
just before or as a followup treatment with the balloon catheters 
more than 225000 balloon catheter procedures are performed each 
year craig p baskin an analyst with duff and phelps inc in 
chicago estimates the new device could account for about 10 
percent of the operations

stock prices declined broadly today but managed 
to close off their worst levels as the rising price of oil drove 
investors to the sidelines 
the decline the sixth in seven trading days underscored the 
markets inability to seize any kind of upward momentum 
prices surged at the opening bell supported by a decline in oil 
prices following president bushs announcement wednesday that he 
would sell 5 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve 
but traders soon realized the amount is insignificant compared 
with the nations energy needs and with tensions escalating in the 
persian gulf oil prices spiked higher briefly over a record 40 
a barrel and sent equities plunging 
at one point the dow jones was industrial average was off 50 
points triggering the new york stock exchanges uptick rule 
which restricts computerdriven program sell orders 
the financial sector continued to take a severe beating and 
served as a drag on the rest of the market several big bank issues 
hit 52week lows in the previous session and tumbled even further

bank customers could pay higher fees or receive 
lower interest on their savings to help make up for the 60 percent 
increase in bank insurance premiums mandated by regulators 
industry analysts said thursday 
the insurance increase also could reduce profits in an 
alreadytroubled industry the analysts said 
but they added that the higher premiums for 1991 announced 
thursday were necessary to ensure the health of the banking system 
the fdic federal deposit insurance corp needs the money 
said christopher mahoney an analyst at moodys investors service 
the soundness of the fdic is important 
analysts believe many banks will try to pass on to customers 
some of the premium increase in the form of higher fees for 
checking accounts bounced checks and other services banks also 
may try to lower the interest they pay on savings accounts 
certificates of deposit and other investments 
under the increase banks will pay the fdic 195 cents in 
insurance for each 100 in deposits starting next year currently 
they pay 12 cents per 100 in deposits 
if banks were to pass on to customers the full 75 cent 
increase a customer with 10000 in his savings account would lose 
750 in interest over a year disregarding compounding 
but such moves could be met with resistance and loss of 
customers analysts said 
its pretty hard to gouge the customer when the customer has 
other alternatives said eric hemel of the investment firm first 
boston corp he said savers could put their money in mutual funds 
or other investments or switch banks 
that means banks may be forced to absorb some or all of the 
insurance increase which could affect their earnings and be 
especially troubling to weaker institutions 
revenues at banks are not growing robustly so any increase in 
expenses is going to hurt said cheryl swaim of the investment 
firm oppenheimer amp co she estimated the higher premiums could 
lower overall bank profits by 2 percent to 3 percent 
ms swaim said most banks do not disclose the percentage of 
their expenses composed of fdic fees but one that does first 
wachovia corp of winstonsalem nc said its fdic cost was 3 
percent of its expenses 
its not a huge chunk she said but for the banks that 
arent earning much money its going to be a higher percentage of 
their earnings 
the insurance increase could push barely profitable banks into 
the red in fact the fdic calculated that if the 1991 rate had 
been in effect last year 69 banks would have recorded losses 
instead of profits and four additional banks would have failed 
the american bankers association believes the increase also 
could lower the amount of money banks have available to make loans 
said spokeswoman ginnie dean 
she said the trade association supports the increase as a 
necessary step but believes changes in the fdic insurance program 
are needed insurance increases could be counterproductive in the 
long run because of their potential to make more banks 
unprofitable she added 
first bostons hemel said concern about the latest fdic 
insurance increase overlooks the bigger picture of what future 
increases may be needed to bail out troubled banks as the economy 
weakens he thinks future hikes could be much larger than the 1991 
increase 
the prices of many bank stocks tumbled thursday but analysts 
said it was due mostly to trouble reported by several major banks 
in recent days not to the insurance increase 
on thursday bank of boston said it expected to report a loss 
this quarter and would reduce its quarterly dividend by twothirds 
on wednesday ncnb corp a bank based in charlotte nc said 
it would report sharply lower earnings this quarter and would 
increase its reserves for potentially bad loans 
and last week chase manhattan corp the nations 
secondlargest bank said it expects a loss this quarter and would 
cut its dividend in half

yearearlier levels were already down sharply from 1988 when the

in compiling its statistics securities data considered 
transactions including mergers acquisitions repurchases 
spinoffs selftenders of stock minority stake purchases and

a committee representing bondholders of allied 
stores corp asked a bankruptcy judge thursday for permission to 
sue allieds owners and banks alleging they fraudulently took 
money out of the company 
bondholders lawyers argued that the threat of a lawsuit which 
would seek damages of at least 700 million and possibly 1 billion 
might prod the targets to settle the claims 
i suggest that its very important these issues be resolved 
said jonathan jacobson a lawyer on the bondholders committee 
representing investors in allied it is critical that the 
defendants face the prospect of judicial reckoning 
us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr took the case under 
review he did not say when he would rule 
his permission is needed for the litigation to proceed because 
aug is overseeing the chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of 
allied and its sister retailer cincinnatibased federated 
department stores inc 
in a sept 6 letter the bondholders lawyers said the 
prospective defendants in the lawsuit could include torontobased 
campeau corp which bought allied in 1986 federated stores inc 
which is campeaus us retailing subsidiary bank of montreal 
banque paribas citibank edward j debartolo corp first boston 
corp and former officers and directors of allied 
bondholders contend that up to 1 billion in proceeds from 
allieds 1989 sale of the ann taylor store division and 1988 sale 
of brooks brothers were fraudulently conveyed to buy worthless 
stock or to pay off bank debt the transactions stripped assets 
from allied to the detriment of its investors the bondholders 
allege 
the lawyers gave advance notice of the lawsuit to meet a 
requirement by aug 
lawyers for allied and several targets of the threatened lawsuit 
asked aug to prevent its filing saying it could slow the 
reorganization they also argued that it could become a tangled 
litigation involving multiple parties and said it should be up to 
allied not the bondholders to resolve the claims since allied has 
primary responsibility for charting its reorganization 
allied lawyer john newman said the proposed lawsuit could become 
a widescreen cinema production 
jacobson asked aug to permit the bondholders to sue on or after 
feb 28 1991 the deadline which ends the period in which allied 
and federated have the exclusive right to file their reorganization 
plans after that creditors may file their own suggested 
reorganization plans 
in another matter aug approved a request from federated and 
allied to appoint a committee to represent the interests of retired 
nonunion employees of the companies in the reorganization 
the judge also approved allieds sale of a company jet a 
gulfstream iii to the deluxe corp of st paul minn for 119 
million 
federated and allied filed reorganization petitions jan 15 
listing more than 77 billion in debts most of those debts were 
acquired because of borrowings by campeau corp to buy allied in 
1986 and federated in 1988

a federal judge fined usx corp 41 
million thursday and ordered two union officials to prison for 
their role in a scheme to get inflated pensions in exchange for 
approving a major labor pact 
the fine was the maximum the company could have received after 
being convicted in july of conspiracy mail fraud and violating 
federal labor laws 
in addition to the fine us district judge eb haltom also 
ordered usx to pay restitution of 289995 to two pension funds 
that prosecutors claimed were depleted as part of the 1983 plan 
haltom sentenced united steelworkers union officials eb rich 
and thermon phillips to 36 months and 30 months in prison 
respectively the men who faced as long as 37 months in prison 
also were fined 6000 each 
phillips released a statement saying the sentence was unjust 
but representatives of the company and rich declined comment 
the judge said he was tougher on rich a regional subdirector 
than phillips the regional union director because evidence showed 
rich was behind the plot 
both men were allowed to remain free on their original 500 
bonds until nov 27 when haltom ordered them to report to an 
unspecified minimumsecurity federal prison 
during a 4month trial prosecutors alleged phillips and rich 
illegally negotiated inflated pensions for themselves and four

union carbide corp announced thursday it 
would sell some assets and reorganize one of its principle 
subsidiaries under a restructuring plan expected to produce 600 
million in aftertax proceeds 
the plan calls for the danburybased company to sell up to half 
the equity in one subsidiary while selling off its interest in two 
businesses and restructuring its industrial gases business it also 
includes buying back up to 14 percent of its common stock 
about half of the 600 million in proceeds will be used to 
reduce the companys staggering debt which totaled 325 billion 
at the end of the second quarter said thomas f sprick spokesman 
for union carbide 
in trading thursday on the new york stock exchange union 
carbide stock closed up 62 cents at 1487 
one analyst said the plan was a step in the right direction but 
wouldnt change the fortunes of union carbide which suffered a 38 
percent decline in secondquarter earnings 
this is good but it could have been better it could have 
been a lot better said harvey s stober a chemical analyst with 
dean witter reynolds inc in new york they should joint venture 
their industrial gas corporation with a strong industrial gas 
producer in europe that is the jewel in this company 
under the plan union carbide would sell up to 50 percent of the 
equity in its ucar carbon company inc subsidiary a major supplier 
of carbon and graphite electrodes to the steel industry 
the sale is expected to result in a onetime aftertax book loss 
of up to 90 million said robert d kennedy carbides chairman 
and chief executive officer ucars sales last year totaled 802 
million 
the book loss from the ucar sale will be offset by an expected 
40 million profit from the sale of union carbides interest in two 
companies he said 
plans call for union carbide to sell off its 50 percent interest 
in kemet electronics corp which supplies capacitors and lincare 
inc a home oxygen and respiratory care supplier the company did 
not disclose the expected selling prices 
the restructuring also calls for union carbide to form five 
independent regional companies within its packaged gases 
subsidiary union carbide industrial gas company inc 
the companies will be formed after certain assets and businesses 
valued at approximately 55 million are divested kennedy said 
other businesses will also be added he said 
domestic sales of packaged gases last year totaled 300 million 
union carbide will also repurchase 20 million shares of common 
stock about 14 percent of its total common outstanding through a 
tender offer kennedy said 
an employee stock ownership plan is also part of the 
restructuring allowing workers to become majority owners of the 
new industrial gases companies kennedy said 
the employee stock ownership plan will be funded through an 
independently managed trust that will borrow 325 million to 
purchase shares of a new issue of convertible preferred stock from 
union carbide 
kennedy said the restructuring plan is designed to establish 
union carbide as a leading global chemical company focused on 
being the lowcost preferred supplier for its industries

reestablish golds traditional role in the market 
on other commodity markets silver and platinum extended their 
losses energy futures rose slightly wheat and soybean futures 
were mostly higher meat futures were higher and corn was lower 
gold continued to rise this week despite the fact that silver

their lowest levels in years 
gold settled 190 to 220 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in september at 40500 a 
troy ounce

1160 lower with october at 43730 a troy ounce 
silver fell 3 cents to 27 cents on the commodity exchange with 
october at 4771 an ounce 
golds downturn thursday could signal that speculators are 
getting over fears of war in the middle east and are looking more 
toward inflation and a possible recession where they would be more 
inclined to hoard their money analysts said 
gold has been trading on the emotion of the market and has 
always been an emotional safe haven for people in times of 
distress said nina lipton vice president of platinum guild 
international in new york i think the market is acting on 
impressions not reality

reported the soviet union might be interested in buying soybean 
meal said walter spilka an analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york 
corn futures prices were mostly lower in thin quiet trading 
after morning weather reports predicted nearideal harvest weather 
over the next week such good weather hold prices lower because 
there is no fear of shortages 
the usda grain stocks report also was a factor in the thin 
trading some analysts said but spilka said after the reports 
release at the close of trading that it should have little effect 
on fridays market 
in the past the numbers have been all over the map he 
said i wouldnt place great emphasis on the report having much 
influence

bushels came in at 239 million corn estimated at 134 billion 
bushels came in at 134 billion and wheat estimated at 2469

delivery in december at 277 a bushel corn was cent lower to 
1 cents higher with december at 227 a bushel oats were 1 cent 
lower to 1 cents higher with december at 116 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 5 cents higher with november at 619 a bushel 
meat futures rebounded after three days of losses amid optimism

and shut down the us packing industry

president bushs son neil testified thursday he 
was a gobetween for a controversial line of credit extended by 
the failed thrift where he was a director but he insisted his 
actions involved no conflict 
bush was testy at times as he testified on the third day of a 
hearing on the governments conflictofinterest allegations 
against him 
bush 35 was a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association which collapsed in 1988 at an estimated cost to 
taxpayers of 1 billion 
the office of thrift supervision brought the action against 
bush which could lead to his being barred from the banking 
industry the ots alleges that bush failed to adequately inform 
fellow silverado directors of his business ties with developers 
kenneth good and bill walters who eventually defaulted on more 
than 132 million in silverado loans 
last week the federal deposit insurance corp sued bush and 
other former silverado directors for 200 million alleging that 
gross negligence on their part contributed to the sampls collapse 
bush told administrative law judge daniel j davidson he had 
absolutely no doubt his dealings with good and walters did not 
conflict with his role as a silverado director 
consequently bush said he did not consult with silverados 
management about the question of a potential conflict 
bush insisted several times that although good and walters 
invested in his oil company jnb exploration he had no financial 
interest in the projects for which they got loans from silverado 
previous testimony however showed that silverado extended a 
900000 line of credit to a partnership formed by bush and good to 
explore for oil and gas in argentina the line of credit intended 
to convince argentine officials that the venture had strong 
financial resources never was used 
under questioning from a government attorney bush said lawyers 
for goods company suggested that bush present the credit line 
proposal to silverados board 
i was a gobetween bush said 
bush maintained there was no conflict in his role because he 
didnt stand to gain any financial benefit from the credit line 
which he described as a sort of letter of referral and because 
he abstained from voting on the proposal 
pressed by ots attorney stephen hershkowitz however bush later 
admitted he had hoped the partnership would eventually benefit from 
the credit line since it would persuade the argentine government 
to permit the venture to drill wells in that country 
i didnt know if we would benefit i hoped that we would 
he said 
bush also said he couldnt remember if it was his own idea to 
abstain from voting on the line of credit or if someone suggested 
it to him 
the judge will examine testimony from the hearing and recommend 
what sanctions if any should be taken against the presidents 
son 
bush also said he used what he obliquely called the smith 
smell test to evaluate a 150000 investment by walters in bushs 
oil company 
if it smelled if my name was mr smith would they be coming 
to me for an investment and you know that would be the test 
he said 
the company used the money to help finance an oildrilling 
venture in wyoming in the mid1980s that never made a profit 
bush told davidson that under his test he would 
automatically reject any proposal that he deemed politically 
motivated 
i gave him a very good deal bush said of walters it was 
a very strong economic deal for him and had we been successful he 
would have made a lot of money 
bush said several times he could not recall whether he had 
discussions with fellow silverado directors about the specifics of 
his dealings with good and walters 
that was five years ago bush said i dont recall the 
specific discussions but the discussions took place or there 
wouldnt have been a general awareness 
at several points davidson warned bush to answer questions 
directly and not to interrupt hershkowitz 
im sorry bush told the judge my lawyer advised me that 
i should listen im sorry 
the judge told bush to be patient 
youre not going to be fooled or tricked by anyone as far as 
im concerned davidson said 
also testifying was florian barth another former silverado 
director who on tuesday had refused to do so 
barth said thursday he was not aware of bushs specific business 
ties with good and walters although he knew about the 
relationships 
there might have been more discussion taking place if we had 
known certain things barth said knowing more about the facts 
might have made a difference

bank of boston corp said thursday it expects to 
report a loss of at least 200 million this quarter as it announced 
plans to slash its quarterly dividend by twothirds and cut its 
staff by 1500 employees 
bank of boston joined a growing list of banks that are reducing 
payments to stockholders and curtailing expenses in the wake of a 
declining economy and troubles with real estate loans 
ira stepanian bank of bostons chairman and chief executive 
officer said the moves are necessary to conserve the institutions 
capital base 
we are taking decisive and admittedly painful actions 
stepanian said 
he said the bank expects to show a loss after taxes of 200 to 
250 million this quarter which ends sunday resulting in red ink 
of up to 200 million for the first nine months of the year 
the dividend cut to 10 cents a share from 31 cents is expected 
to conserve about 43 million yearly 
the bank said the expected loss stems from several factors 
including additions to loan loss reserves of 150 million to 200 
million an expected writeoff of bad loans totaling 175 million 
chiefly on real estate and 50 million in charges related to the 
staff reductions and other cutbacks 
bank of boston is a regional bank holding company with assets of 
37 billion it owns banks in massachusetts maine connecticut 
rhode island and vermont 
stepanian said the staff reduction will begin immediately with a 
voluntary plan that offers benefits for employees wishing to leave 
stepanian said the bank is still expanding its retail operations 
and increasing its marketing efforts 
james e moynihan jr an analyst with the investment firm 
advest inc in boston said the announcement was expected the 
market place had discounted this news long ago this stock value 
has been cut in half for the last six weeks he said 
but moynihan added the news really isnt quite as bad as it 
had been thought 
bank of bostons stock fell 37 cents a share to close at 712 
in consolidated new york stock exchange trading thursday 
also thursday bank of new englandwest based in springfield 
laid off 201 of its 1125 employees as part of a plan to cut its 
work force by about 30 percent before the end of the year 
the bank also announced plans to sell four branches and 
consolidate 11 branch offices the moves are part of a recovery 
plan by the banks troubled parent bank of new england corp of 
boston 
stock prices of other banks also fell thursday industry 
analysts attributed it to a spate of bad news recently by a number 
of banks 
on wednesday ncnb corp based in charlotte nc said it 
would report sharply lower earnings this quarter and increase its 
reserves for potentially bad loans 
last week chase manhattan corp the nations secondlargest 
bank said it also expected a quarterly loss and would cut its 
dividend in half

a year after failing to takeover ual corp 
california billionaire marvin davis suggested he should buy the 
parent of united airlines and give employees an opportunity to buy 
him out in two years officials said thursday 
we propose to effectively bridge the acquisition of ual for 
its labor and employee groups for a period of two years davis 
said in a letter to the united employee acquisition corp 
the employee group which faces an oct 9 deadline for financing 
its own buyout plan said it doesnt expect to need the help 
in a letter dated wednesday davis proposed negotiating a merger 
with ual in which employees would receive 20 percent ownership of 
the company and agree to union contract concessions amounting to 
comparable value 
the employees would have the option to buy davis controlling 
position in ual after two years davis said 
we believe we have found a solution which both facilitates 
labors acquisition of ual and provides stockholders fair value for 
their investment he said in the letter to gerald greenwald 
chief executive officer of the employeeled buyout group 
davis did not suggest a purchase price in the letter 
the pilots flight attendants and machinists unions have offered 
201 a share or 438 billion for ual the company directors 
accepted the offer but the employee group has had trouble coming 
up with the financing 
the employee group failed to meet a deadline in august and was 
given a twomonth extension by the directors the board said then 
that if the financing was not in place by oct 9 the deal would be 
off 
greenwald said in a statement released thursday in new york that 
the employees expected to be able to pull off their acquisition 
without davis 
ueac is optimistic that it will be able to finance and 
complete a proposal of its own greenwald said 
accordingly we do not expect any action will be taken on 
the proposal contained in mr davis letter 
in august 1989 davis offered 54 billion or 240 a share for 
ual and later upped the bid to 619 billion or 275 a share 
a month later the corporations directors accepted a bid of 
675 billion or 300 a share plus employee concessions in a 
deal with uniteds pilots management and british airways plc the 
next day davis offered to match that bid with no demand for 
concessions 
a month after that the employee takeover planned collapsed for 
lack of financing and davis withdrew his matching bid 
the latest employee offer was devised in the spring and accepted 
by the board april 6

unisys corp on thursday decided to suspend 
its common stock dividend choosing to pay off debt with the 40 
million normally paid to shareholders each quarter 
the announcement sent unisys stock to a new low for the year of 
537 a share down 23 percent on the new york stock exchange 
company officials said suspending the dividend would ultimately 
benefit shareholders by helping improve the overall financial 
structure of the company 
this was the best way to accelerate our progress in improving 
the capital structure company spokesman peter hynes said after 
the board of directors meeting in detroit 
unisys based in nearby blue bell owed 36 billion on june 30 
down from a peak 41 billion in the middle of 1989 hynes said 
the computer company reported a 639 million loss last year 
hynes said debt was cut 325 million in the first six months of 
this year and the companys goal was to reduce it by 600 million 
to 800 million in 1990 
the company showed meager profits for the first part of the 
year but they were not enough to cover payment of preferred 
dividends the poor performance prompted standard amp poors corp to 
drop its rating on unisys debt and preferred stock to just one 
notch above junkbond status 
the secondquarter profit of 118 million became a 151 
million loss after dividends on preferred stock were paid these 
dividends were not affected by thursdays decision 
the third quarter ends sunday and the projections are not good 
all we can say is we project a loss and a profit in fourth 
hynes said 
james a unruh unisys president and chief executive officer 
said a poor economic climate influenced the boards decision 
the conclusion was that this is simply not an appropriate 
point in the companys history to pay high dividends unruh said 
in a prepared statement 
unisys has made no decision about when the annual 1 common 
stock dividend will be restored hynes said the company will wait 
for better profitability a lower debt and an upturn in the 
sluggish economy he said 
hynes said the quarterly dividend has been 25 cents a share at a 
cost of 40 million 
other steps toward debt reduction include the sales of real 
estate and nonstrategic businesses hynes said 
last week unisys unveiled a computer line aimed at upgrading 
minicomputers made by its stiffest competition ibm corp 
minicomputers fall midway between personal computers and large 
mainframes and can support several users at one time 
the announcement was unusual in that ibm and unisys make 
computers that are not designed to be mixed and matched with the 
equipment of other companies

a state board heard lastminute support and 
objections thursday to a sweeping antismog plan that would force 
production of lowemission vehicles and distribution of cleaner 
fuels 
the core of the plan is a vehicle and its fuel are one system 
in regard to exhaust emissions therefore reducing emissions 
demands changes in both 
the california air resources board will vote on the plan friday 
the plan seeks to overcome the catch22 of building 
alternativefuel cars when the fuel is unavailable or marketing 
cleanerburning fuels when there are no cars to use those fuels 
it would also require fuel companies to distribute a certain 
amount of alternative fuel to ensure availability 
meanwhile thursday new yorks environmental board adopted auto 
emission and durability standards equal to californias the 
nations strictest 
the new regulations which take effect in the 1993 model year 
are expected to be adopted by 1995 in seven other northeastern 
states they require mandatory inspection of exhaust emissions and 
assemblyline testing and prohibit the sale of replacement parts 
that do not meet emission standards 
among the cleanerburning fuels being considered in the even 
stricter california proposal are methanol ethanol liquefied 
natural gas and compressed natural gas cars powered by electricity 
are also a possibility 
with filthy air hanging over california cities and roads jammed 
with 22 million cars opponents are careful not to criticize the 
entire proposal but to target certain points 
oil companies want the state board to abandon mandatory 
distribution volume quotas for the new fuels because there is no 
way to force consumers to buy them 
automakers say they are concerned about the timetable for 
designing testing and introducing new vehicles as well as 
uncertainty of the technology and the need for marketing 
incentives 
george babikian president of atlantic richfield co urged the 
board to eliminate mandatory distribution in favor of mandatory 
availability 
the plan anticipates introduction of flexiblefuel vehicles 
which run on either gasoline or methnol blends given the choice 
babikian contends a driver will choose gasoline because it is 30 
to 40 cents cheaper per gallon 
if distribution were mandatory oil companies would lower the 
price of methanol to sell it and subsidize the alternative fuel by 
raising the price of gasoline he said 
the plan would between 1994 and 2003 require the use of cars 
that are 50 percent to 84 percent less polluting than those which 
meet the current strictest standards the state agency would test 
the cars emissions before licensing them 
in the first year about 200000 ultra clean cars would be 
required about 10 percent of annual new car sales in california 
by 2003 the regulation would cover all 2 million cars sold 
annually 
the board also would mandate production of socalled 
zeroemission electric cars starting in 1998 up to 200000 
electric cars could be in the state by the year 2003 the arb 
contends 
the board says the plan is expected to reduce emissions of 
hydrocarbons by 28 percent or 185 tons per day nitrogen oxide by 
18 percent or 248 tons per day and carbon monoxide by 8 percent 
or 317 tons per day 
the plan would take effect in the south coast air basin which 
encompasses smoggy los angeles before going statewide the 
regulations could be challenged in court 
certainly a nation that has the capability of building an 
airplane that you cant see a submarine that you cant hear can 
get electric cars built to get us to work and back david 
friedman general manager of the sacramento municipal utility 
district an electrical power utility said at the hearing 
if the government can put one on the moon surely detroit can 
put one on the road 
james lents executive officer of the local south coast air 
quality management district hailed the plan as essential to the 
district 
we must continually remind ourselves that our 13 million 
residents breathe the most polluted air in the nation and it 
impairs their lifestyle and health lents told board members

president bush may be willing to drop his 
insistence for a cut in the capital gains tax republican 
congressmen said wednesday a demand that has been the major 
obstacle to a budget deal 
but the apparent softening of bushs position was revealed on a 
day when bush and congressional democrats had their most withering 
public flareup over the talks in weeks 
the two sides accused each other of endangering their stalled 
bargaining just five days before disruptive cuts in government 
services will be imposed if the negotiations fail 
the white house signalled a willingess to consider keeping the 
current capital gains tax rate the same as ordinary income but 
exempting gains due to inflation democrats brushed aside the idea 
and after nearly six hours negotiators broke off discussions for 
the evening at nearly 1130 pm 
bush said nothing about his reported change in his capital gains 
stance as he campaigned for republican candidates in ohio 
the hangup is with the democrats he said accusing them of 
refusing to do their part to cut the deficit 
if and when the ax falls the democratic congress knows that 
it will be held accountable he said and i will take that 
message to every state in the union it is their fault 
he also told reporters while flying to ohio that democrats 
have not come forward with a package at the talks a remark 
that touched off a democratic uproar 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said democrats have made several 
offers in recent bargaining sessions 
to begin a series of charges or countercharges at this 
stage is not helpful foley said it is damaging to the talks 
though were determined it not be critically damaging 
mitchell said the president must have been badly misinformed 
to have made the comment and called it highly misleading and 
damaging 
the foleymitchell complaints led bush to apologize at a later 
speech in chicago earlier today i said the democrats have not 
come forward with a package they say they have put a package or 
at least a series of proposals on the table in private 
negotiations i accept the fact that in private negotiations there 
have been such proposals i apologize for misspeaking on that 
point 
however he said we have yet to see a comprehensive plan 
that encmpasses the goals of serious spending cuts budget process 
change and incentives for economic growth 
hundreds of unionized federal workers rallied outside the 
capitol at noon to demand a quick solution to the budget crisis 
they carried signs reading your furlough begins nov 6 election 
day and congress you do your jobs so we can do ours 
the rally was organized by the american federation of government 
employees which represents 700000 federal workers 
inside the building the senate voted overwhelmingly to apply 
the spending cuts to the salaries of members of congress and top 
executive branch officials including vice president quayle and 
members of the cabinet items now exempt under the grammrudman 
budgetcutting law 
after a morning meeting at the white house gop lawmakers said 
bush was signalling compromise instead of lowered capital gains 
tax rates bush might accept other items he believes would spur the 
economy they said 
he might be willing to look at other alternatives in the 
growth area said senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
rep newt gingrich of georgia the no 2 house republican said 
the alternatives could include corporate tax breaks designed to 
encourage research and to prod businesses to operate in ailing 
urban and rural areas 
the developments occurred as negotiators for the white house and 
congress were resuming their search for a package of tax increases 
and spending cuts that could reduce the deficit by 500 billion 
over five years 
republican bargainers continued to present various offers 
involving a reduced capital gains tax which is imposed on profits 
from the sale of property said officials who asked to not be 
identified 
one version would tax only the increased value of an asset that 
exceeds inflation but democrats said they wanted absolutely 
nothing to do with capital gains said one official 
hanging over the bargainers was the prospect of 85 billion in 
potentially disruptive cuts scheduled to take place automatically 
monday reductions that could result in furloughs for as many as 
21 million federal workers and curtail government programs as 
diverse as air traffic control to food inspections 
if the cuts take effect affected domestic programs would be 
slashed by 324 percent and defense programs by 353 percent 
social security the military payroll and many benefits for 
veterans and lowincome people are exempt from the cuts 
with no spending legislation in place for the new fiscal year 
which starts monday the house prepared to decide whether to 
provide temporary financing for the government democratic leaders 
were ready to delay the vote until friday or later in hopes of 
reaching a budget compromise 
a vote was also planned on whether to postpone the approaching 
spending cuts with bush vowing to block any delay 
it is the law of the land and i took an oath to the 
constitution to the land bush said about the pending cuts 
weve tried to do our part 
participants in the budget talks reported progress in a late 
night session tuesday particularly over the size of cuts in the 
military and medicare which provides health care for the elderly 
the talks on a deficit deal have been bogged down for weeks and 
participants on both sides have said the presidents insistence on 
a cut in the tax in profits from investments has been a major 
stumbling block 
democrats have called for an increase in income tax rates for 
the wealthy to offset any benefits from the cut that bush wants 
the president has been insisting on a capital gains tax cut out 
of the belief that it would stimulate the economy at a time of 
economcc slowdown many economists believe the country is headed 
for a recession if not already in one
