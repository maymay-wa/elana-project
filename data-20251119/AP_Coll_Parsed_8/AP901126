earl wild celebrated his 75th birthday and lots 
of people came wild strode onto the carnegie hall stage and gave a 
magnificent piano recital on monday night the 75th anniversary of 
his birth in pittsburgh 
a few days before his birthday wild said hed always been known 
as having expert technique and these days he is thinking about the 
music more 
he began monday night with beethovens 32 variations on an 
original theme differentiating the variations with a tiny pause 
between each 
then he played chopins four ballades chosen because 
theyre serious pieces that he has lived with all his life and 
still is trying to project better these ballades arent 
program music but its easy for a listener to visualize being in a 
beautiful maze garden turning corners and seeing something quite 
different as chopin moves between power and delicacy 
after intermission wild played liszts funerailles moving 
and somehow uplifting with none of liszts wellknown bravura 
plus two concert etudes and rhapsodie espagnole 
wild composes and makes transcriptions for piano which he 
considers virtuoso etudes he played three transcriptions as 
encores floods of spring by rachmaninoff pas de quatre 
from tchaikovskys swan lake and gershwins i got rhythm 
pianist billy taylor was seen in the audience smiling broadly 
during the last one 
wild received a standing ovation two bouquets and a cake 
wheeled out from the wings 
he was 14 in 1929 when first engaged by otto klemperer as 
pianist for the pittsburgh symphony trying to build a career 
during the depression his first job was making orchestrations in 
1936 he got hired as staff pianist at nbc in 1939 he gave the 
first piano recital on american tv in 1942 when toscanini decided 
to conduct his first rhapsody in blue he chose wild whod 
never played it either as his soloist wild was immediately hailed 
as a gershwin expert 
he taught at the juilliard school for 10 years and now is 
distinguished artistinresidence at ohio state university

the familiar rugged faces and slight 
builds of the yemenis once conspicuous in markets across saudi 
arabia are slowly disappearing as a result of the persian gulf 
crisis 
instead egyptians are showing up in larger numbers along with 
more indians and pakistanis in a gradual transformation of the 
lower echelons of the kingdoms labor force 
the unique position of up to 2 million yemenis disintegrated 
after their government supported iraq following its invasion of 
kuwait 
saudi arabia retaliated by ending the work and trade privileges 
which the yemenis alone enjoyed among scores of other third world 
communities primarily because of the common saudiyemeni border 
about half of the yemenis have already returned home 
egyptian president hosni mubarak on the other hand has led the 
cry against saddam hussein from the start of the invasion and his 
egyptian work force is reaping the benefit 
informed sources here expect the egyptian labor force already 
estimated at 750000 to grow by thousands as the yemenis depart 
one diplomatic source noted that several large companies plan to 
hire egyptians and have applied to the interior ministry for work 
visas 
weve even heard that egyptian workers whose contracts were 
renewed in september received generous raises in salary said one 
informed source it was the private sector showing their 
appreciation for egypts stand 
the yemenis departure has already left some scars albeit 
temporary a trip down riyadhs wazira street reveals scores of 
empty storefronts the interiors nothing but rubble and a few 
remnants of goods sold in haste 
a yemeni man used to deliver my newspaper every morning 
said one executive i havent seen him for two months tomorrow 
hes being replaced by a pakistani 
some complain that the yemeni bakers known for their delicious 
arabic bread will be sorely missed and impossible to replace 
thank goodness the baker i go to is still here said one 
expatriate 
although the move against yemen was an angry response to yemen 
president ali abdullah salehs alignment with saddam diplomatic 
sources in riyadh said the decision probably made sense regardless 
of politics 
to have 10 percent of your total population running around 
without documentation just seems silly said one diplomat it 
was silly before the invasion but it was really brought home to 
them after aug 2 
the authorities had simply decreed that yemen nationals 
previously allowed to work in saudi arabia without formal 
sponsorship would be treated like everyone else 
except the timing of the measure meant many saudis would not 
sponsor them 
the majority of yemenis in saudi arabia were shop owners and 
vendors semiskilled and unskilled laborers many were mechanics 
bakers merchants porters car washers and tea boys 
the effect of the new rules on saudi arabias economy has been 
minimal a former saudi government advisor noted theres a lot 
of underemployment here anyway and the yemenis contributed to that 
i dont think there will be major repercussions from their loss in 
fact i think there will be some benefit 
businesses previously in competition with yemeni merchants would 
now prosper he said 
a diplomat however pointed out that saudi arabia may feel the 
loss of yemeni spending power while the average yemeni salary is 
700 riyals the equivalent of 186 monthly yemenis do not remit 
the greater part of their salaries back home 
most of the expatriates cant bring their families with them 
but the yemenis can said the diplomat so they dont send as 
much money home its an important demographic difference most of 
the money they earn goes back into the saudi economy 
sources estimate that approximately 1 million yemenis will 
remain in saudi arabia under official sponsorship few expect that 
number to increase when the persian gulf crisis is over 
i wouldnt like my government to give equal opportunity to 
those who did not stand with us said the chief operating officer 
of a major company

john klein weeds a row of beets and white 
radishes with a turnofthecentury woodandiron push hoe 
nearby tall zucchini plants sprout limp yellow blossoms his 
mother barbara sells corn cucumbers tomatoes and fruit to 
passersby from a stand on the street 
this is new york citys last family farm two green acres in the 
fresh meadows section of queens surrounded by small brick 
apartment houses an elementary school paved ball court and a 
broad street noisy with buses and traffic from nearby expressways 
a couple of weeks ago these guys from florida got off the 
clearview expressway and came down the street asking directions 
and they couldnt believe there was a farm in the middle of queens 
they thought they were in the twilight zone said klein 25 a 
fourthgeneration farmer 
the two acres slightly bigger than a square city block with a 
chainlink fence on three sides and a lawn and tall oaks in front 
are all thats left of a 100acre spread that was sold off piece by 
piece over the years 
the kleins grow beets carrots scallions radishes basil 
dill parsley cucumbers squash and kohlrabies stuff that 
doesnt need that much room to grow klein explained 
the rows are so short he has to weed them by hand its too 
small to use a tractor he said by the time you got there 
youd have to turn it around 
but the family also grows corn melons and produce that needs 
more space on 100 acres in riverhead on long islands eastern tip 
its trucked in each day to the farm stand 
open july to november seven days a week from 9 am to 6 pm 
the farm stand on 195th street and 73rd avenue does a brisk 
business 
in queens to find a farmers market this is really an 
oasis said sylvia ehrlich as she examined tomatoes 
i come here all the time the stuff is delicious agreed 
michael morache who was buying zucchinis 
freshness is key i go out and pick it in the morning and by 
the end of the day its home in their refrigerator said klein 
we run out and pick the basil and dill and parsley right away for 
people because if you leave it out for a halfhour it gets 
wilted 
his greatgrandfather adam began farming in fresh meadows in 
the 1890s his greataunts margaret and stella live in two brick 
houses on the remaining two acres 
why keep the queens land when the family owns 100 acres in 
riverhead 
its definitely a tradition but its making a living also 
said klein if you go out to riverhead on every corner theres a 
farmstand but were the last ones here 
certainly queens is better known as home to the mets archie 
bunker and 2 million of the citys 75 million residents than as an 
agricultural community 
but queens like the four other boroughs has a rich farming 
past dating to the 1600s only in the 1800s did industry and 
housing begin to replace open space around the city narrow 
winding streets in lower manhattan recall cowpaths bleecker street 
in greenwich village harks back to the bleecker farm of colonial 
times in the 1830s trains chugged through miles of rocky 
wasteland overrun by pigs and goats from what is now little italy 
up to harlem according to the works progress administration guide 
to new york city 
small farms called truck farms because their produce was 
trucked into urbanized areas to be sold remained common in 
brooklyn queens staten island and the bronx until after world war 
ii when developers gobbled up land to build housing 
henry ludder the queens borough historian recalled cutting 
across vegetable fields as he walked home from school in bayside 
queens in the early 1940s i can remember pulling a carrot or a 
beet out of the ground rubbing the dirt off on my pants and 
chewing it as i went along he said 
about 20 farmhouses dating from 1679 through 1871 around the 
city are designated landmarks most are owned by historical 
societies two the queens county farm museum in floral park and 
the decker farm owned by the staten island historical society 
remain working farms 
but the klein enterprise is the last family owned farm within 
city limits even the klein farm in riverhead is one of a vanishing 
breed 
i imagine another 25 years riverhead will be like here and 
youll be out there writing about the last farm said kleins 
father also john 47 
after adam klein sold most of the queens property he bought 
farmland in hicksville long island and then was pushed out 
further east to melville and again out to riverhead 
i guess we cant go too much further or else well be in the 
ocean said the younger klein 
theres no farms in hicksville now and theres only four or 
five farms left out in melville and property is worth a million 
dollars an acre out there so the guys holding it are just dumb 
his father said 
would he consider selling the two acres in queens 
if i didnt want to farm anymore id just plant it with 
grass put a big swimming pool in the back he said if you 
dont have to sell it why sell it

lawmakers looking for ways to trim the federal 
deficit can cut defense spending and even raise taxes if they have 
to but they have found theyd better not touch social security 
this year social security will dispense about 265 billion 
more than onefifth of all federal spending but the program was 
untouched in the deficitreduction package enacted last month 
and new budget rules make social security virtually untouchable 
in the future 
the reason has much to do with the political power of the 
elderly but also with the programs overall popularity analysts 
and lawmakers say 
its a real gut issue said sen john d rockefeller 
dwva 
both social security and medicare the health care program for 
the elderly are enormously popular programs noted henry 
aaron director of economic studies at the brookings institution 
the public opinion polls indicate that people would prefer to cut 
the deficit in any other way 
that explains why as lawmakers were voting billions of dollars 
in new taxes and defense cuts to cut the budget deficit last month 
social security recipients being were told their benefits would 
increase 54 percent in january 
the bush administration announced this month it was looking at 
ways to shift government benefits from the wealthy to the poor but 
it specifically excluded social security 
rep ron wyden dore noted that members of congress are 
still pretty sensitive after having to repeal the medicare 
catastrophic illness program last year after an outcry by senior 
citizens who didnt want to pay for it the program was designed to 
protect the elderly from financial ruin if they were struck by a 
devastating illness 
a fight over medicare cuts was one issue that delayed last 
months budget agreement in the final version medicare takes a 
42 billion hit over five years about 10 billion of that comes 
from beneficiaries pockets 
social security and medicare are widely considered the most 
effective government programs ever to improve the lives of senior 
citizens 
a 1988 census bureau report said social security benefits lifted 
15 million elderly citizens out of poverty in 1986 and cut the 
poverty rate among the elderly from 47 percent to 14 percent 
its done a fantastic job of reducing poverty among the 
elderly said robert ball former social security commissioner 
about two thirds of beneficiaries get more than half their income 
from social security 
social security and the hospital part of the medicare program 
are funded in the same way with a payroll tax held in a trust 
fund earmarked solely for that program 
neither program is run like welfare benefits are given to rich 
and poor alike rather the criteria are related to age or 
disability plus a persons lifetime contributions to the program 
its precisely the fact that theyre not programs for the poor 
that gives these programs their unifying force said gary 
burtless a senior fellow at brookings 
people think they have paid and now theyre entitled to 
benefits aaron said 
judy schub senior economic lobbyist at the american association 
of retired persons said the elderly tend to think of their social 
security benefits as money that was put away for them that 
theres a piggy bank with my name on it 
however the system is an intergenerational plan with todays 
recipients receiving far more than they ever paid into the system 
current workers are paying those benefits 
after financial troubles in the early 1980s social security 
benefits were scaled back in 1983 and other changes were made to 
keep its trust fund solvent 
now theres a large surplus and sen daniel moynihan dny 
tried this year to reduce the social security payroll tax so that 
money from the program would not grow so quickly and be used to 
mask the size of the federal budget deficit 
his effort was unsuccessful but others in congress did succeed 
in removing the program from the calculations used to determine the 
federal deficit that means that cutting social security wont help 
the deficit 
medicare however is facing mounting pressure as inflation in 
medical costs continues to outpace overall inflation the reserves 
in the medicare hospital insurance trust fund are shrinking and the 
fund faces bankruptcy in 13 to 15 years unless action is taken 
according to the 1990 annual report of the programs board of 
trustees 
ball said he is mindful of social securitys popularity and the 
political risk in touching it 
changes should be made in social security from time to time 
to bring it up to date and make it a better program said 
ball a member of the social security advisory committee at the 
department of health and human services 
but he said the changes should be made for sound social 
security policy not to reduce the deficit

critics of rep dana rohrabacher archfoe of 
federal spending on obscene art hooted with glee over rumors 
that the conservative california republican had written a movie 
script ablaze with steamy love scenes 
but rohrabacher is having the last laugh he says hes on the 
brink of signing a deal with hollywood producers to film his 
screenplay the french doctoresse a world war ii drama of 
romance and intrigue that he predicts will earn nothing worse than 
a pg rating 
theres not a single bedroom scene or people not wearing any 
clothes he said its something the whole family could see i 
think its going to be the dr zhivago of the 1990s 
rohrabacher is a bearded 43yearold bachelor surfing 
enthusiast and former newspaperman who was a speech writer for 
president reagan until he won election to the house in 1988 with a 
campaign boost from white house buddy oliver l north 
in the house where he represents a staunchly conservative 
coastal district south of los angeles rohrabacher quickly became 
the scourge of the national endowment for the arts which he 
accuses of financing pornography and sacrilegious works 
rohrabacher said he sold everything he owned except for his car 
and his typewriter to finish the french doctoresse in the late 
1970s and was reduced to sleeping on his brothers living room 
sofa 
as poor as he was rohrabacher said he never once contemplated 
applying for a federal grant besides he said his script was much 
too tame to interest the arts endowment 
who knows what kind of steamy sex scenes would be required for 
me to get an nea grant he said with a chuckle 
his screenplay is based on the reallife story of jeanne 
varagnat a wealthy redhaired divorced french physician who 
falls in love with a handsome young french fighter pilot named john 
fontaine 
madame varagnat spends the war years trying to win the release 
of her lover who is captured and eventually executed by the 
germans after the war she is imprisoned on charges of 
collaborating with the nazis but she is acqitted at her trial 
when she proves she was not a traitor but a spy for the french 
resistance 
rohrabachers screenplay reads more like a harlequin romance 
written for the care bears crowd even a pg rating might be 
overreacting 
rohrabachers story has the lovers meeting on a skiing vacation 
the pilot has taken a tumble on the slopes cut to the resorts 
infirmary 
as jeanne waits for john to regain consciousness she cant 
help noticing his handsome features and rugged virile body 
a whirlwind romance ensues the couple take sleigh rides 
through the snow many nights are spent in front of a fireplace 
against the majesty of the french alps they kiss as they ride a 
ski lift 
midnight is tolled at a new years eve party and the lovers 
kiss as 1940 explodes into reality around them they enjoy a 
picnic in the countryside the food and wine are consumed with 
gusto and the two lovers embrace under the shady branches 
thats about as hot as it gets there isnt enough steam to take 
the marine corps crease out of ollie norths trousers 
rohrabacher envisions jessica lange meryl streep or even jane 
fonda playing the older woman and said the young lovers role 
should go to a mel gibson with a french accent 
but rohrabacher warns that once a deal is signed hollywood 
producers will be free to write sex or violence into the final 
script to enhance the movies boxoffice appeal 
the congressman said he wouldnt object if the rrated material 
improved the plot and wasnt merely exploitative in any event he 
would have little say in the matter 
if they want to make it steamy they can do it they own it 
he said

many scholars and commentators speculate on 
why congress does what it does with explanations ranging from 
partisan theology to personal avarice to group psychology 
fewer have tried to explain however why congress does what it 
does as poorly as it often does but a new survey by the 
congressional management foundation offers some insight with a look 
into the inner workings of house members offices 
the picture that emerges is not one of an elite cadre of public 
policy experts as voters might expect instead its a revolving 
door where some offices must have higher turnover than fastfood 
restaurants 
work in congress has become a stepping stone for the young and 
restless rather than a career for the dedicated and experienced 
said rick shapiro executive director of the foundation and a 
coauthor of the study 
the foundation which tries to instill professional management 
practices in lawmakers found data that make shapiros statement 
seem quite mild 
for example 52 percent of house legislative assistants the 
people who tackle specific issues for the members and recommend 
solutions have been at their jobs less than one year nearly 40 
percent of their bosses the legislative directors are in the 
same category 
a congressmans top aide is called an administrative assistant 
this is the person who oversees everything is the keeper of the 
body the equivalent of the presidents chief of staff 
amazingly nearly a third of these people have been on the job 
less than a year 
and all house staffers have held their jobs for 15 percent less 
time than they did in 1987 
it means that members of the house are generally receiving 
essential advice and support from staff who have considerably less 
experience than the staff they worked with just three years ago 
shapiro said 
to put it more bluntly there are a lot of people on capitol 
hill tinkering with the nations laws who may not know what theyre 
doing and its not just the people who are elected 
the foundation points to salaries as one explanation for the 
rapid turnover the average house employee makes 29542 more than 
2000 less than the average federal worker and 11000 less than 
private sector earners 
this statistic is misleading however since so many house 
employees are so young the average administrative assistant is 38 
the average legislative assistant is 26 
senior staffers in congress are quite well paid the average 
administrative assistant gets nearly 63000 and more than 10 
percent are above 80000 some of them can and do turn around 
and double or triple their salaries by signing on with lobbying 
firms 
all of this suggests that legislative competence is getting 
short shrift in congressional offices just think back to this 
years budgetmaking mangle and its hard to argue with that 
conclusion 
so where are congressmen putting their priorities toward 
getting reelected of course 
this years elections showed once again that big national 
issues werent the downfall of very many lawmakers perhaps thats 
because the builtin advantages of incumbency are nurtured by the 
members 
the biggest pay raises handed out in congressional offices over 
the past three years totaling 188 percent went to press 
secretaries the men and women who make sure their bosses get good 
coverage in hometown newspapers and local television programs 
another reason members are rarely kicked out of congress is 
because of the favors they do for the folks back home 
next to the press people the directors of the lawmakers home 
district offices had the biggest salary boosts at 183 percent 
over three years they also had more job stability than any other 
type of congressional office employee with an average of 55 years 
in the position 
right after them in tenure with an average 47 years were 
the caseworkers the folks who can help straighten out a citizens 
problem with social security or a businessmans beef with the small 
business administration 
these are the kind of favors that challengers can only dream of 
delivering to voters 
challengers might be more successful if they could convince 
voters that those services would continue no matter who holds the 
jobs while the issues they are voting on are getting less and less 
expert attention

better times have helped ease loan pressures 
on the farmers home administration but a backlog of hardluck 
cases has sharply boosted foreclosure actions by the agency 
in the 1990 fiscal year that ended sept 30 the fmha tallied 
50803 loan applications down 13 percent from 58539 in 1989 
according to a yearend report 
overall the fmha traditionally called the governments farm 
lender of last resort had a farm loan portfolio of about 24 
billion among 210458 active borrowers of those 31925 were 
behind in their payments as of sept 30 
a year earlier when there were 230013 loans outstanding 
41213 were in arrears an 18 percent delinquency rate 
the fmha an agency of the agriculture department makes loans 
to farmers and others who cant qualify at banks and other 
commercial lenders the agencys total portfolio including farm 
rural housing and other programs is around 575 billion 
marlyn aycock an agency spokesman said the loan decline is 
attributable to whats happened in the farm economy generally 
over the last few years 
according to usda economists cash farm income nationally in 
1990 is expected to be at a record level probably in the range of 
59 billion to 63 billion up from 55 billion in 1989 
that is the money left over in a calendar year from gross cash 
income after paying cash expenses according to usda analysts the 
previous high was 584 billion in 1988 
but the mills grind slowly in fmha and thousands of farmers are 
still being affected by the financial crunch of the early and 
mid1980s when debt loads forced thousands into restructuring loans 
and for some into foreclosure proceedings 
the number of potential foreclosures is indicated by 
acceleration letters sent to delinquent borrowers a major step 
toward final closeout of an fmha loan through foreclosure 
another step is the number of accelerated cases referred to usda 
lawyers to await formal foreclosure action by the government 
last fiscal year according to the report 5462 acceleration 
letters were sent out representing 26 percent of all farm 
borrowers in the previous year notices went t 4045 borrowers 
or 18 percent 
aycock said bankruptcy petitions and the number of fmha 
delinquency cases sent to the departments office of general 
counsel for foreclosure action also have increased 
it means that were working through the old backlog and more 
and more of these cases are getting closer to a conclusion he 
said 
foreclosures arent the only way fmha can collect what is owed 
nor are foreclosures the only reasons farmers go out of business 
pressure by the agency can result in the sale of property in 
which case the debt is often settled or in the voluntary transfer 
of property to fmha as part of a settlement deal 
according to the annual report there were 2505 fmha borrowers 
who left farming due to financial difficulties in the 1990 
fiscal year representing 12 percent of the total number of farm 
borrowers 
in 1989 only 2066 left farming due to financial difficulties 
representing 09 percent of 1989 borrowers 
actual foreclosure actions completed by fmha last year totaled 
243 against only 45 in 1989 in addition there were 179 
foreclosure actions completed by banks and other lienholders that 
share loans with the agency compared with 258 in 1989 
eight states accounted for threefourths of last years fmha 
foreclosures alabama 18 georgia 18 minnesota 26 mississippi 
12 missouri 28 north carolina 29 south dakota 17 and texas 
35 
meanwhile the fmha has written off in one way or another nearly 
40 percent of 88 billion in overdue loan payments 
the forgivenesses stem from the agricultural credit act of 1987 
which allowed writedown and writeoff of debts in cases where 
collection costs would exceed the recovery value some borrowers 
working with fmha also are allowed to buy out their loans at 
current liquidation rates 
aycock said that as of september the buyouts of 6774 loans 
showed net losses totaling 146 billion writedowns of 6580 
totaled 102 billion 
in addition about 1 billion in old debts some going back 10 
years or more have been written off completely as uncollectable

mercenary killer wasps are being deployed in 
a battle to rescue besieged cabbage broccoli and other vegetables 
without resorting to chemical pesticide warfare 
scientists say the wasps cost about the same as pesticides but 
attack pests on parts of plants that chemical sprays dont reach 
and can eliminate cropeating bugs that have developed immunities 
to insecticides 
the wasps also are choosy about their victims they do not sting 
humans or animals 
wasps released two weeks ago in the rio grande valley naturally 
seek out the larvae of the diamondback moth and lay eggs inside 
them ensuring their destruction 
our research has shown that the wasps can provid a new way to 
reduce insect damage to cabbage broccoli and other vegetables 
without using insecticides said entomologist k duane biever of 
the us department of agriculture 
in previous tests biever found only 5 percent pest damage to 
broccoli fields after releasing 300 to 600 pairs of wasps per acre 
in fields without the wasps 25 percent of the crops were damaged 
the strain of wasps was developed at a usda laboratory in 
washington and bred commercially at a private laboratory in sinton 
a town north of corpus christi

aids is no laughing matter at the safer sex 
boutique but the unique shop offers such lighthearted gifts as 
condomshaped candy and boxer shorts adorned with smiling condom 
cartoons that glow in the dark 
shoppers also can buy earrings and key chains that discreetly 
store condoms inside or use a computer that calculates a persons 
likelihood of exposure to aids 
the unusual store open this holiday season is a commercial 
experiment to market both silly and serious products that promote 
safe sex and draw attention to the needs of those who have acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
this is designed to talk about and promote safer sex by making 
it more fun and exciting said dave rompa executive director of 
the aids support network in madison an advocacy group that helped 
develop the business 
some stores will have a safesex corner or cute little condom

promises have been made a year after 
africans braved tear gas and gunfire to shout for democracy in more 
than a dozen capitals but not a single oneparty government has 
been unseated 
fifteen regimes have said they would accept multiparty rule but 
there is no sign that democratically elected administrations will 
replace any of them soon 
leaders who could not crush protest movements with troops and 
arrests have turned to delaying tactics while paying lip service 
to democracy with promises of free elections critics say they use 
a bag of dirty tricks to stay in power 
those who mimicked the communist system and told their people to 
look there for inspiration were taken at their word when east 
europeans started demanding freedom 
after the collapse of communist parties in the soviet bloc the 
writing was on the wall for africas oneparty governments western 
nations that helped corrupt leaders in order to keep them from the 
soviet orbit found it difficult to justify more support 
there is no true development without genuine democracy 
jacques pelletier the french minister in charge of relations with 
africa said recently 
france is a staunch advocate of aid to third world countries 
but pelletiers comments echoed those of african opposition 
leaders not governments 
at a conference on africa herman cohen us assistant 
secretary of state for african affairs said governments that 
resisted their peoples demands for democracy would find themselves 
in an increasingly disadvantageous position in the competition 
for aid 
bans on opposition parties have been lifted in six countries 
benin cape verde gabon ivory coast sao tome and zaire 
nine have agreed to move toward ending oneparty government but 
opposition parties are not yet operating they are angola 
cameroon congo guinea bissau mozambique niger rwanda somalia 
and zambia 
the first show of unrest came from benin where protesters 
stoned a statue of lenin they blamed the nations bankruptcy on 
the marxistleninist ideology adopted by president mathieu kerekou 
who gained power in a coup and demanded his resignation 
kerekou renounced communism in response and said his government 
was writing a new constitution to liberalize the economy and 
guarantee human rights in a move later copied by president mobutu 
sese seko of zaire he appointed a transition government but set no 
date for himself to step down 
mobutu shocked zaire in april when under intense pressure from 
the united states and other western backers he said he would give 
in to demands for multiparty democracy 
student unrest continued and belgium the former colonial power 
accused zairean commandos in may of killing more than 100 at 
lubumbashi university mobutus government claimed only one student 
was killed and blamed local government officials 
in november six months after mobutu legalized opposition 
parties soldiers still were breaking up their meetings 
on nov 6 opposition leader etienne tshisekedi said mobutu had 
ordered him prevented from leaving the country to meet with 
secretary of state james a baker iii in the united states 
other leaders like president daniel arap moi of kenya 
gnassingbe eyadema of togo and joseph momoh of sierra leone have 
said no to change and often have called out soldiers to enforce the 
decision 
gabon moved closer to democracy than the others when president 
omar bongo was forced to conduct the first multiparty general 
election in 22 years 
several rounds of voting had to be held because voters smashed 
ballot boxes burned government cars and attacked officials they 
claimed were rigging the election 
bongo emerged with a bare majority in the national assembly but 
his term as president does not expire for three years 
ivory coast held its first contested presidential election in 
october police dispersed opposition campaign rallies with tear gas 
and clubs on election day voters smashed ballot boxes and claimed 
fraud 
governmentcontrolled television and radio denied the opposition 
access until the campaign was nearly over then censored their 
statements 
laurent gbagbo a history professor was the only opposition 
candidate two others could not raise bonds equivalent to 80000 
each which the government announced as a requirement one week 
before the 10day campaign began 
everyone expected the victory of president felix 
houphouetboigny the octogenarian who has ruled since independence 
from france in 1960 but many doubt he got the 8167 percent of the 
vote his government claims 
the countrys first multiparty parliamentary election was held 
sunday and opposition leaders claimed it was marred by 
intimidation and fraud perpetrated by houphouetboignys democratic 
party turnout was light 
the democrats were expected to easily win a majority 
reinforcing houphouetboignys huge victory last month

four storage tanks holding more than 2 million 
gallons of jet fuel caught fire sunday near stapleton international 
airport snarling comings and goings at the terminal as holiday 
travelers headed home after thanksgiving 
a fire at a holding pond that had collected some of the spilled 
fuel was extinguished with foam but authorities feared it might 
reignite and spread to a nearby 2 milliongallon fuel tank 
firefighters had been trying to cool two 800000gallon tanks 
containing jet fuel throughout the day spraying them with strong 
jets of water but they caught fire about 10 pm 
when the two tanks ruptured firefighters had to be pulled back 
the tanks were designed to rupture rather than explode when 
overheated officials said 
an attempt to snuff that part of the fire with foam failed 
we didnt have the capacity to provide foam in the amount 
needed fire chief rich gonzales said 
three firefighters were treated at denver general hospital for 
dehydration and heat exhaustion and two others were treated for 
smoke inhalation at the scene but the fire caused no serious 
injuries 
smoke from the blaze cast a pall over metropolitan denver and 
caused visibility problems on nearby interstate 70 which remained 
open 
norm avery a stapleton spokesman said the airport was open 
but united airlines was forced to delay cancel and divert flights 
because of a fuel shortage 
there also were traffic jams outside the airport on one of the 
its busiest days when travelers were returning from the 
thanksgiving holiday stapleton is the nations fourthbusiest us 
airport as measured by numbers of passengers traveling through it 
airport officials initially planned to contain the intial fire 
and let it burn itself out but they changed their plans when 
flames altered by shifting winds began to threaten the larger 
tanks 
the fire was reported about 930 am at the fuel tank farm 
about a halfmile north of the stapleton terminal and just south of 
i70 
also threatened were two tanks about 100 yards from the blaze 
that held 15 million gallons of jet fuel each said mike mcneill 
a denver fire department spokesman 
the fire torched nearby utility poles and generated so much heat 
that firefighters worked in 30minute shifts near the flames 
the blaze apparently was caused by a broken valve leading into 
one of two 400000galloncapacity storage tanks and the heat from 
the first fire ignited the second tank avery said 
there are no homes or businesses anywhere near the site 
the storage tanks were part of stapletons fuel storage farm 
which supplies jet fuel to most of the airlines at the airport it 
is the chief source of fuel for united airlines 
in attempting to control the fire firefighters shut off the 
underground pipeline from the tank farm to the stapleton terminal 
and united officials were scrambling to find ways to obtain jet 
fuel said stapleton spokesman richard boulware 
united airlines reported flight delays of up to four hours out 
of denver affecting connecting flights at other major hubs 
officials said 
united is virtually out of fuel and trying to make 
arrangements to get more said boulware 
some united flights were diverted to colorado springs and other 
nearby airports to obtain fuel and other flights were delayed or 
canceled united officials at the airport said 
boulware said continental airlines was forced to shift its 
refueling operations to a stapleton concourse but this had little 
effect on its operations

california lawmakers returning to work next 
week will be tackling a familiar issue budget cuts this time 
however theyll be slashing their own budgets 
voters on nov 6 narrowly passed proposition 140 which limits 
lawmakers terms eliminates their pension benefits and demands 
cuts of about 40 percent in the legislatures budget 
analysts say half of the 3200 legislative staff members could 
be laid off 
the day after the proposition passed assembly speaker willie 
brown spoke to capitol staffers 
he said dont worry till after the holidays go ahead and 
try to have a good thanksgiving and christmas weve got til 
july said michael reese browns press secretary 
still most lawmakers returning for the new session dec 3 are 
already pondering prospects of layoffs and lawsuits many members 
of their staffs are looking for new jobs the session lasts through 
august 
the senate rules committee sent a memo suggesting senators begin 
planning staff reductions the committee said it would offer 
golden handshakes to encourage longtime employees to retire 
whats out there permeating the place is the human factor 
said bob forsyth a spokesman for sen david roberti chairman of 
the committee i think most people who came to work for the 
legislature came here voluntarily they do not get civil service 
benefits theyre anxious about their job futures 
proposition 140 passed with 52 percent of the vote it was 
backed by antitax crusader lewis uhler and conservative republican 
los angeles county supervisor pete schabarum 
it limits assembly members to three twoyear terms senate 
members the governor and other elected statewide officials and 
members of a state tax board can serve no more than two fouryear 
terms 
the measure also eliminates legislators pension benefits 
leaving only what had been accrued by election day the mandated 
legislative budget cuts must be made by july 1 but the proposition 
does not spell out how 
i think its clear then when you have over 3000 legislative 
employees you could probably prune pretty heavily and still get 
the legitimate legislative business done uhler said 
san francisco attorney joe remcho said he believes proposition 
140 is vulnerable to a legal challenge the senate rules committee 
is also reviewing the legal issues involved 
remcho successfully sued on behalf of the legislatures 
democratic leaders and others to overturn a campaign spending 
initiative approved by voters in 1988 backers of the measure are 
appealing that federal court decision 
remcho said lifetime term limits on legislators disenfranchise 
voters particularly minorities 
uhler said the initiative was drafted to withstand court 
challenges sponsors reluctantly agreed to give incumbens the same 
fresh six to eightyear limits newcomers face he said 
thats a long time for those who carry grudges in the 
legislature and who seek retribution a lot of time for that to 
play out uhler said

the big three automakers are blaming economic 
uncertainty and dealer backlogs for the temporary layoff of 38800 
employees 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said the 
layoffs would begin today and run through dec 7 at 14 assembly 
plants in eight states 
we are watching the marketplace and then we adjust production 
to meet those needs kathy tanner spokeswoman for gms 
chevroletpontiaccanada group said sunday 
additional layoffs would be announced five to 10 days before 
they were to be imposed officials said 
i wouldnt be surprised to see more said joel pitcoff 
fords research and analysis manager 
weve been having shortages of dealer orders for some time 
pitcoff said its clear the dealers are nervous about the 
recession talk 
the shutdowns wont put a big pinch on workers wallets 
contract agreements with the united auto workers union provide 
laidoff workers with up to 95 percent pay during shutdowns 
the layoffs are an indication of a slowdown in the industry 
with manufacturers possibly wanting to avoid the overbuildup they 
experienced a year ago when 107000 big three workers were 
furloughed in january 
wards automotive report an industry newsletter reported 
inventory for the nine major us automakers stood at 72 days nov 
10 compared with 88 days in december 1989 
the largest single layoff will be at chryslers toledo ohio 
plant where company spokesman doug nicoll said about 4700 workers 
are affected 
gm announced about 21900 layoffs and ford has furloughed about 
12200 workers

genetic tests show that as many as half the 50 
florida panthers still remaining in the wild may not be true 
florida panthers at all but a hybrid species biologists said 
scientists warn that if the hybrids found in everglades national 
park and the neighboring big cypress swamp area continue to dilute 
true florida panthers bloodlines the species could become so 
watered down it could lose its place on the endangeredspecies 
list 
if the panther were to lose protection then the entirety of 
wild florida is left open to development says melody roelke who 
studies panthers for the florida game and fresh water fish 
commission 
if bumped off the list the cats would no longer be protected by 
a federal ban on killing or capturing them the federal endangered 
species act doesnt cover hybrid animals 
genetic tests of 26 panthers in south florida showed only 13 
were true florida panthers the others were a hybrid of florida 
panthers and a south american cousin released into the wild in the 
1950s and 1960s 
the pure descendants of true florida panthers are characterized 
by a kink in the tail and a cowlick of ruff of spiky hair on 
their tawny colored backs they live mostly in the big cypress 
national preserve 
the others descendants of florida panthers and seven captive 
cats released into the wild between 1957 and 1967 also are tawny 
colored 
similar crossbreeding has prompted officials to consider 
removing others from the endangered species list 
the federal farm bureau has asked the us fish and wildlife 
service to take the gray wolf off the list because genetic evidence 
shows some gray wolves crossbred with coyotes

president carlos salinas de gortari 
chose monterrey for the summit with president bush because this 
northern city symbolizes the economic miracle he envisions for 
mexico 
but as bush arrives to discuss a free trade agreement some 
businessmen fear mexican industry could suffer under such a pact 
its inevitable some businesses will fail others will have 
to change said miguel garza who owns a ceramics factory its 
a new world 
because the agreement has not taken form uncertainty is mixed 
with the skepticism formal negotiations dont begin until next 
year and could take two years to complete 
a free trade agreement will not change our situation and could 
help us said ernesto garcia martinez director of cifunsa an 
auto parts company in nearby saltillo the mexican automotive 
industry has proven itself for quality and volume 
labor leaders predict a free trade agreement will cost jobs by 
creating a form of economic darwinism that will choke industries 
unable to compete with us technology and industrial efficiency 
when president franklin d roosevelt visited monterrey in 1943 
it already was on the way to becoming mexicos industrial capital 
we are the locomotive that is pulling the nation to 
modernization mayor socrates rizzo says now 
glassandsteel towers occupied by businessmen with us 
university degrees have come to overshadow the colonial buildings 
and cobbled streets of old monterrey 
the city glitters with prosperity but city workers made it over 
for the summit nonetheless painting buildings and repairing 
streets while white house teams checked security arrangements 
more than 1000 telephone lines were installed to accommodate 
hundreds of journalists a heliport was built in monterrey and an 
airstrip added to salinas nearby hometown of agualeguas for the 
bush visit

sign flashed welcome in english and spanish 
the monument to the meeting between roosevelt and president 
manuel avila camacho a large concrete cross on a street corner 
had been vandalized and its plaque was missing it was cleaned up 
repaired and moved to a park 
a monument to the bush visit has a flame that will remain 
lighted while he is here 
interdependence with the united states has developed in 
monterrey through crossborder culture usowned assembly plants 
and travel the city is 150 miles from texas and the us 
consulate issued more than 200000 visas last year for travel north 
of the border 
nuevo leon state of which monterrey is the capital now has 
7500 businesses the number is expected to increase with a free 
trade agreement and completion of new bordercrossing facilities

the second half of the world championship 
between chess masters and archrivals garry kasparov and anatoly 
karpov began with a draw 
they were to return to the table today for the second game of 
the championships french phase 
the 13th game had adjourned saturday night after 41 moves in 
five hours of play with a draw inevitable according to the 
experts 
karpov who is trying to regain the world championship title 
from defender kasparov proposed the draw on sunday by telephone 
through the intermediary of dutch referee geurt gijssen officials 
said an option open to either player 
kasparov accepted 
karpov playing white would have opened sundays play with the 
42nd move which was sealed saturday night in an envelope 
kasparov 27 and karpov 39 now each have 6 points they were 
tied at six points apiece after the first 12 games in new york from 
oct 8 to nov 7 10 of which were draws 
the first player to gain 12 points wins the championship and 
17 million of a 3 million purse in the event of a tie kasparov 
retains the title 
saturdays match in the main auditorium of the palais des 
congres in this southcentral city was the first in the championship 
series in two weeks 
karpov moved the queens pawn to begin play the players went 
through a series of moves known as the grunfeld defense which was 
used in game 9 
kasparov varied it a bit when he castled on the eighth move 
the pair traded queens before the 20th move and were reduced to 
eight pieces each by the 30th 
karpov repeatedly left his chair in the early part of the match 
kasparov stayed at the board hunched over in deep thought 
at the adjournment kasparov had just taken a pawn to finish 
with five pawns a rook and the king 
karpov had four pawns a rook and a king but was about to take a 
black pawn to even things up again 
karpov waited more than 10 minutes as the fivehour time limit 
drew close before sealing his 42nd move 
i thought it was reasonable exciting said international 
grandmaster mike valvo of perth amboy nj it was not a dull 
2530 move draw you would see in other matches 
karpov ran into a time problem as the time limit approached 
with only nine minutes to complete eight moves each player is 
alloted 2 hours for his first 40 moves 
but karpov moved eight times in his next seven minutes 
most of us who sat and watched thought that white had chances 
to win valvo said in time pressure karpov seemed to let 
whatever edge he had slip away 
kasparov gained the title in 1985 from karpov who had held it 
from 1975 
their dislike for each other is wellknown 
the two men differ in temperment looks politics and even 
playing style 
kasparov considers karpov a product of the soviet system 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals kasparov 
has said in an interview but in my case with karpov its a 
fight between two different mentalities in russia i identify him 
with the system ive been fighting

scientists eager to create a threedimensional 
map of the universe are embarking on a 14 million telescope 
project aimed at exploring the origins of galaxies 
the search of the skies is expected to produce the most detailed 
charts of the universe to date according to members of the 
astrophysical research consortium a group composed of several 
universities and the princeton njbased institute for advanced 
study 
scientists said they hope to produce a threedimensional layout 
of 1 million galaxies 100000 quasars and numerous intergalactic 
gas clouds 
a twodimensional color version of 100 million galaxies also is 
planned 
the survey is the cosmic equivalent of a us geological 
survey map said richard kron a professor of astronomy and 
astrophysics at the university of chicago 
it will show the details of galaxy and quasar distribution as 
well as the largescale geography of the universe kron said 
quasars are starlike celestial objects that produce immense 
quantities of light or powerful radio waves or both 
the university of chicago is a member of the consortium that 
includes the institute for advanced study new mexico state 
university princeton university the university of washington and 
washington state university 
the consortium voted nov 20 to move ahead with the project 
which is scheduled to begin in 1995 the university of chicago 
princeton and the institute for advance study will split the costs 
said university of chicago spokesman larry arbeiter 
the new telescope and its instruments have been specially 
designed by astronomer jim gunn of princeton to map the universe 
quickly the telescope combined with digital and robotic 
technology will enable astronomers to complete the mapping in five 
to seven years the group said 
the telescope will be placed on apache point in new mexicos 
sacramento mountains 
the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia ill is 
expected to provide the computer equipment needed to store and 
analyze the surveys estimated 10 million megabytes of information 
roughly enough data to fill a telephone directory for 250 billion 
people officials said 
scientists say the map could help answer questions about the big 
bang theory which proposes that the universe was created in a 
massive explosion 15 billion years ago 
the simplest theory indicates the explosion should have 
scattered matter uniformly across the universe but galaxies are 
found in clusters 
the survey may show if still unknown subatomic forces or 
particles formed the beginnings of galaxies during the big bang 
scientists said 
information gathered by the survey may also provide astronomers 
with an insight into the nature of dark matter material that 
has been detected through its gravity but remains unidentified

expected later today 
a dec 9 runoff will be held between the two top votegetters if 
neither wins an outright majority 
gorka who drove from st louis to the polish consulate in

polishamericans a total of 800000 to 12 million than any 
municipality outside warsaw 
more than 16000 ballots were cast in new york state according 
to the consulate in new york city 
alderman roman c pucinski a walesa supporter said returns in 
chicago especially in the heavily polish 41st ward he represents 
show walesa does get his strength from the blue collar workers 
in chicago walesa got 76 percent of the vote to mazowieckis 18 
percent 
unofficial north american results showed walesa with 21608 or 
60 percent mazowiecki with 11823 or 33 percent tyminski with 
1238 or 3 percent and the remainder for the other three 
candidates jaroszynski said

authorities have charged two prominent figures in 
last years prodemocracy movement with plotting to overthrow the 
government a crime punishable by death chinese sources said 
today 
the charges against chen zeming publisher of the nowbanned 
economic studies weekly and wang juntao its editor are the most 
serious to be brought so far against intellectuals involved in the 
prodemocracy movement 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said relatives 
of the two men received formal notices late last week that chen and 
wang had been charged with plotting to overthrow the government 
and counterrevolutionary incitement 
the beijing city foreign affairs office said it had not heard 
about the charges 
the governments move more than a year after the two men were 
arrested indicated its desire to wrap up remaining cases from the 
protest movement and put the controversial events behind it 
other sources have said the government is preparing to hold 
trials for alleged ringleaders of the protests which began with 
student marches in beijing in april 1989 and spread nationwide the 
movement was crushed when the army opened fire on protesters in 
beijing two months later killing hundreds on unarmed civilians 
hundreds of participants in the protests already have been sent 
to labor camps a punishment that requires no trial dozens of 
others have been tried secretly and at least 18 are known to have 
been executed 
however none of the alleged ringleaders has yet been put on 
trial one reason is the communist partys fear that trials would 
require releasing information about the involvement of highlevel 
party officials in the movement the party has closed its 
investigation of ousted party chief zhao ziyang without announcing 
any conclusions or punishment for that very reason 
zhao was dismissed as party general secretary last year for 
allegedly supporting the democracy movement 
chen and wang acted as advisers to the beijing student protests 
helping plan the strategy of early student marches and formulate 
demands 
both got their first experience in confronting the government in 
1976 when they joined a protest in tiananmen square against the 
radical leftist officials who led the destructive cultural 
revolution 
they were arrested then but were released when the cultural 
revolution leadership was ousted and the protest was officially 
reappraised as patriotic 
wang became a leader in the communist youth league but 
continued challenging the official line he helped found an 
unofficial journal called beijing spring in 1978 during a brief 
period of open political debate called the democracy wall movement 
many other participants in that movement were jailed 
he and wang were arrested in october 1989 in canton where they 
apparently were trying to flee the country 
family members have not been allowed to visit wang and chen in 
prison although they have been allowed to send books and clothing 
wangs wife hou xiaotian also was jailed for several months after 
the protests she was recently released from a hospital after being 
treated for ailments she said were related to her prison stay 
the government recently set up a special group of lawyers to 
defend protesters brought to trial sources said the protesters 
would not be allowed to hire their own lawyers or organize their 
own defense 
authorities say 355 people remain in jail under investigation in 
beijing in connection with the democracy movement and two in 
shanghai no figures have been released for the rest of the 
country

to silence critics who suggested selling 
nearly empty buses and using the money to buy lonely riders cars of 
their own officials made bus rides free but the gravy train is 
nearing the end of the line 
starting new years day the buses will cost 50 cents again 
meaning riders will have to pay for the first time in 15 months 
under an order approved by the capital metropolitan 
transportation authority board the elderly and disabled would 
remain exempt from the renewed fee 
some downtown express service still wont cost anything and 
there will be discounted bus passes available but some say free 
rides should not end because the move attracted tens of thousands 
of new riders 
city councilman max nofziger who serves on the transportation 
oversight panel wants to keep the nofare system pointing to a 
threequarter cent sales tax that funds the bus system 
i dont think they should charge the riders an additional fee 
to actually get on the buses because those folks have already paid 
once through the sales tax nofziger said 
a panel of elected officials must review the decision to 
reinstate fares which was approved 43 by the capital metro board 
after considering reports of problem passengers and concerns about 
lost revenue 
capital metro board members lyndon henry and dennis garza said 
the system is losing 38 million a year 
no other transit system in the country is doing what were 
doing and i think for good reason garza said they cant 
afford it 
dennis kouba of the american public transit association in 
washington said he knows of no other city offering free bus fares 
the elimination of fares began as a threemonth program in 
october 1989 when jokes abounded about the number of empty city 
buses rolling around town the running gag was that selling the 
buses and buying riders cars would save money 
after fares were suspenced ridership grew by 82 percent in the 
first nine months of 1990 compared to the same period last year 
said capital metro spokesman howard goldman 
on the average weekday in september 1989 50765 people rode the 
bus this september the average was 84540 
the president of the local bus drivers union joneth wyatt 
said a big drawback of the freeride program has been problem 
passengers 
people tend to disrespect something that you get for free 
wyatt said he said the city traded good passengers for the bad 
passengers 
we gained the transients we gained a lot more school kids who 
would normally walk to school we gained the gangs the 
undesirables wyatt lost he said were everyday working 
people

jewish college students who share a 
kosher kitchen that was defiled with antisemitic slurs and human 
waste said the incident has left them united 
if we can continue having kosher meals togetherthen theres 
still the sense of community and of jewish people as survivors 
student aline iskander said sunday 
police classified the vandalism in a section of macalester 
colleges kirk hall dormitory as a bias crime against jews the 
dormitory section is known as hebrew house 
ted leventhal 21 a former director of hebrew house said he 
and two friends who iive there found an obscene note and a mixing 
bowl filled with feces in the kitchen friday night 
the note read in part achtung cant you clean up after 
yourselves didnt hitler teach you nothing remember neatness 
reflects your character shape up or ship out 
in signing the note the vandals claimed to be members of the 
aryan youth movement police officer larry sandell said police have 
no information about the group 
the intruders also broke eggs extinguished cigarettes on the 
carpet and littered the floor with beer cans and other debris 
hebrew house has its own kitchen so jewish students in kirk hall 
can prepare kosher meals under strict religious standards 
i think they knew that striking in the kitchen defiling the 
kitchen would have been significant to the house leventhal 
said 
the kitchen will be cleaned and blessed before it is used again 
the message is sickening and antisemitism is sickening 
said robert gavin president of the small liberal arts college i 
certainly find it abhorrent 
police are investigating the incident gavin said access to the 
kitchen would be restricted 
bernard raskas a rabbi emeritus of temple of aaron in st paul 
and a macalester faculty member called the incident shocking 
my first reaction is that this is the product of sick and 
twisted personalities and they need help raskas said on the 
other hand one is not surprised with the rising tide of 
antisemitism all over the world 
about 8 percent of macalesters 1750 students are jewish

iraq today denounced us plans to seek a 
un security council resolution authorizing military force in the 
persian gulf and said it would not withdraw from kuwait even if 
such a resolution were approved 
if anybody believes that this newest resolution will influence 
our position or force us to abandon our rights they are completely 
wrong we respect un resolutions only when they are just and 
balanced the ruling baath party said in its daily newspaper 
althawra 
the frontpage editorial was the first official reaction to 
reports that the united states would ask the security council to 
approve military force unless iraq withdraws its troops by jan 1 
the proposed resolution was circulated as the council prepared 
to begin debate on new steps to try to resolve the persian gulf 
crisis if adopted it would mark the strongest step taken by the 
council since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
baghdad has refused to abide by previous resolutions demanding 
that it withdraw from kuwait 
ten days after the invasion president saddam hussein said he 
would negotiate about kuwait if talks were also held on other 
middle east problems specifically the israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip 
iraq has insisted that the security council resolution calling 
for israeli withdrawal from palestinian lands must also be 
implemented if it is to abide by resolutions on the persian gulf 
althawra claimed the united states is using terrorism 
threats and blackmail to try to win approval for the resolution 
the editorial urged other security council members to vote 
against the resolution which it said would pave the way for an 
overall american hegemony not only in the region but in the world 
at large 
nobody should blame us if we say that whats going on in the 
security council is a scandal on a widescale level which violates 
all international laws and norms althawra said 
we wonder how other parties themselves will react to the 
american attempt to impose their hegemony and tyranny over the 
whole world it said

with a shockingpink picture of tokyos skyline 
gracing its front page japans first newspaper designed for women 
lady kong hit the newsstands today with lots of fluff but 
little feminism 
as with virtually all enterprises here men run the daily 
tabloid leading some critics to complain that the publication is 
not likely to challenge the subservient role of women in japanese 
society 
everything even sanitary napkins has been planned and 
produced by men said harueko kato a communications professor at 
tokyo womens christian university and news coverage is not an 
exception 
the tabloids name refers to king kongs girlfriend the name 
apparently is meant to show that women are strong too 
kato believes the most important aspect of the new daily 
newspaper will be how the opinions of the female employees are 
reflected in the decisionmaking and news writing 
that will depend to a large extent on masahiro oshima the 
41yearold man who is the tabloids editorial director 
twentyseven of the 47 editors and reporters on his staff are 
women but they are in charge of only the entertainment and city 
guide sections 
the company specifically recruited male writers to work in the 
news department oshima explained to give news stories a serious 
tone 
despite the radical image the tabloid is cultivating with its 
odd name and its advertisements suggesting greater independence for 
women there appears to be little emphasis on feminism and social 
issues 
the leading headline on the splashy front page was a call for 
tokyos commuter trains to extend operations a few hours each night 
to 2 am for the benefit of people who stay out late drinking and 
dancing 
the rest of the 80cent newspaper which describes itself in 
english as a newsy tabloid for tokyoites reads like a typical 
fashion magazine with a few pages of news slapped onto the front 
the first edition included a series of interviews with female 
business executives as well as a softporn story titled honest 
legs gossip items and entertainment news 
oshima says he had wanted to carry more features on social 
issues but a sixmonth marketing research program led him to 
reduce stories on politics business womens issues and the 
environment 
japanese women are not ready for such a progressive paper 
i was quite disappointed to discover that he said in a recent 
interview at his office 
to achieve its daily circulation goal of 350000 lady kong 
largely reflects the editorial content of the many popular womens 
magazines already flooding the market with heavy doses of fashion 
cooking and new products 
the tabloid says it also is trying to attract female readers by 
using stainfree print that does not rub off young japanese women 
often complain that ink from the regular broadsheet newspapers 
dirties their hands and expensive designer dresses 
one kiosk in central tokyo carried a few dozen issues of lady 
kong along hundreds of existing tabloids that aim exclusively at a 
male readership heavy with sports coverage and female nudes 
lady kong is a joint venture between a japanese publisher and a 
british brokerage investors include orient co the nations 
leading finance company

the five permanent members of the un security 
council have reached agreement on a draft accord to settle the 
cambodian conflict us officials said today 
the agreement paves the way for reconvening the paris conference 
on cambodia in the next few months said richard solomon the 
assistant secretary of state who represented the united states in 
the three days of talks that ended sunday 
this was an important step forward in the process of a 
political settlement to the 12yearold cambodian civil war 
solomon said 
the latest talks brought together the five permanent security 
council members the united states britain the soviet union 
china and france as well as representatives of indonesia and the 
united nations france and indonesia are cochairs of the paris 
conference on cambodia which closed in failure in 1989 indonesia 
also agreed to the draft accord 
a statement issued by participants in the talks said it is 
urgent that the four cambodian factions resolve differences 
over leadership of the supreme national council 
the supreme national council is to help guide cambodia through 
elections after a truce it has six representatives from the 
government and six from the threeparty resistance coalition led by 
prince norodom sihanouk 
the councils first meeting broke down sept 17 over guerrilla 
demands that sihanouk be its chairman and 13th member the phnom 
penh government says making sihanouk head of the council would tip 
the balance in the coalitions favor 
the statement by the five permanent security council members 
said they would welcome the election of sihanouk to head the 
council but that cambodians themselves should work out a formula 
for the bodys composition 
on sunday sihanouk urged the government and the three 
resistance groups to meet as soon as possible in paris to discuss 
their differences 
the draft comprehensive political settlement agreed to after 
the latest talks in paris is based on the framework agreement of 
august and endorsed by the security council and the un general 
assembly 
it contains a draft agreement covering major aspects of the 
settlement as well as five annexes to the political settlement 
dealing with the un role a ceasefire and withdrawal of foreign 
forces elections repatriation of cambodian refugees and 
principles for a new constitution 
the five security council members also set out a draft agreement 
on the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity and 
neutrality of cambodia and a draft declaration on rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of the nation 
the resistance coalition has been fighting the hun sen 
government since it was installed after the vietnamese invaded in 
december 1978 and toppled the khmer rouge which had killed a 
million people during its reign 
the khmer rouge is the strongest military arm in sihanouks 
resistance coalition

israel urged egypt today to clamp down on 
extremists after a lone gunman crossed the lightly patrolled 
frontier and killed four israelis in a roadside ambush before being 
shot and retreating into egypt 
we cannot grow accustomed to enduring a peace with israeli 
bloodshed said israeli foreign minister david levy 
the egyptian government must understand that everything must 
be done to end this serious situation which is intolerable 
israeli blood cannot be cheap in egypt he said on israel radio 
twentyseven people were wounded in sundays attack which 
occurred about 15 miles north of eilat and was among the worst ever 
along the border 
the attacker sprayed fire from a kalashnikov automatic rifle 
into a bus and three military vehicles before he was himself shot 
and fled officials said 
a moslem fundamentalist group called islamic holy warjerusalem 
claimed responsibility 
egypt signed a peace treaty with israel in 1979 but there have 
been periodic border incidents the last attack was on feb 4 when 
gunmen abmushed an israeli tour bus in egypt killing nine israelis 
and wounding 20 
despite strong israeli concerns about the violence a top 
israeli army official said there are no plans to reinforce israels 
most peaceful frontier 
the egyptian border is different than the others it is 
border of peace and i suggest we dont make the mistake of 
relating to this border as a hot one at war it would be a real 
mistake a psychological mistake said chief of staff lt gen 
dan shomron on israel television sunday 
it was the third attack against israelis in two days 
in a suicide bombing earlier sunday a lebanese woman with a 
handbag packed with explosives was killed and two israeli soldiers 
were wounded in southern lebanon 
on saturday at least four palestinian guerrillas were killed 
when an israeli navy gunboat sank a dinghy off the lebanese coast 
a palestinian group said four of the guerrillas were missing but 
one swam ashore it said the guerrillas had planned a raid in 
israel 
following the shooting near eilat egyptian soldiers captured a 
suspect described as an border policeman stationed in the area a 
senior egyptian security source said israeli reports said the 
suspect suffered a head wound after a bus guard shot at him as he 
fled 
the assailants bloodstained flak jacket was found on the 
israeli side of the border with allah written on it army 
radio reported 
during the halfhour rampage the gunman killed the drivers of 
all four vehicles he attacked three of the drivers were soldiers 
and most of the wounded were civilians the army said 
the assailant had acrossed the border through a dry river bed 
early in the morning taking up a position near a gravel shoulder 
of a road army and television reports said 
passengers on egged co bus recounted moments of terror and

snow and chilly temperatures helped firefighters battle two huge

president felix houphouetboignys 
party won an overwhelming majority in parliament in multiparty 
elections that ended 30 years of unchallenged rule the government 
said today 
opposition politicians accused the governing party of 
intimidation and fraud during sundays voting 
the interior ministry said the governing democratic party won 
163 seats in the 175member assembly while the popular front the 
main opposition party won nine of 10 seats captured by government 
opponents the remaining two seats went to governing party members 
who ran as independents 
two opposition leaders who both are university professors were 
elected the popular fronts laurent gbagbo and francis wodie 
head of the ivorian workers party and dean of abidjan university 
faculty of law 
wodie a former president of the amnesty international human 
rights organization beat gbagbos top ally and two candidates from 
the governing party to win the seat for the affluent cocody suburb 
where houphouetboigny voted 
wodie said in an interview that it is difficult to believe 
tese results are correct that the opposition is in such a 
minority 
he blamed a low voter turnout which he estimated at between 50 
percent and 60 percent and suggested some ivorians did not bother 
to vote believing balloting would be rigged 
the democratic party had been expected to win but not with such 
a vast majority 
its victory reinforced houphouetboignys reelection last month 
in the first contested presidential race in this west african 
nations 30 years of independence all under his rule 
the presidents sole challenger gbagbo has charged that the 
governing party also rigged that election in which the 
octogenarian president was awarded 8167 percent of votes 
about 44 million people registered to vote in the contest among 
490 candidates from 19 parties results are not official until the 
supreme court ratifies the count later this week 
popular front officials charged that the governing party hired 
thugs to intimidate voters 
in abidjans high density suburb of yopougon for example they 
said thugs drove three cars into a crowd of their followers on 
saturday injuring several in an ensuing fight 17 people were 
hurt and 10 of them were being treated in the hospital a spokesman 
said 
yopougons deputy mayor mustapha doukoure said popular front 
militants provoked the clash by attacking governing party 
supporters with sticks and stones to stop them from holding a 
peaceful march 
he said 37 of his supporters were injured 
voting was generally peaceful and policed by armed soldiers 
the opposition alleged several irregularities 
in yopougon for example reporters found three polling stations 
closed because electoral lists were missing names of voters the 
popular front said this was to prevent people voting in an area 
where it has strong support 
yopougon was the site of the first prodemocracy protests in 
ivory coast in february weeks of strikes and violent riots 
followed forcing houphouetboigny to legalize political 
opposition 
opposition parties were handicapped by a nationwide network the 
governing party has built up over 30 years of singleparty rule and 
its large funds from compulsory contributions exacted from civil 
servants salaries 
also against them was the governments insistence that 
nonivorian africans working in the country be allowed to vote 
such foreigners comprise at least a third of the 112 million 
population and almost all support houphouetboigny 
a security guard from neighboring burkina faso said he and his 
brother were beaten up by popular front supporters when they lined 
up to vote 
he said they fled their polling station in adjame suburb without 
voting the guard requested anonymity saying he feared 
repercussions

more than a quartermillion railroad workers in 
eastern germany were on strike for higher pay today in the first 
widespread job action since the two germanys united seven weeks 
ago 
the strike started sunday evening in berlin halting intercity 
rail traffic from the main stations in the eastern and western 
halves of the city and it spread to 26 other cities in eastern 
germany this morning union spokesmen said 
pay levels in the former communist part of the country for 
almost all lines of work are about a third of western pay scales 
and most industries plan to raise eastern scales gradually over 
several years to levels in the west 
in another job action related to german unification 10000 
civilian workers at nato bases staged warning strikes today their 
union the public service and transport union said the workers 
need higher pay job protection or retraining because nato troop 
reductions are expected to cut 23000 of the 100000 civilian jobs 
at nato bases 
the warning strikes hit such major us bases as ramstein air 
base in southwest germany and rheinmain air base just outside 
frankfurt union spokesman rainer hillgaertner said but there was 
no immediate indication of possible impact on us troop movements 
through the bases to the persian gulf us spokesmen said 
the strikes are for better contracts for the workers they are 
not politically motivated and are not directed at slowing down 
movement of soldiers to the gulf region hillgaertner sad 
nato troop strengths in germany are to be reduced as soviet 
troops withdraw from eastern germany over the next four years as 
part of the international agreements that permitted east and west 
germany to unify 
the eastern and western rail companies in germany are to be 
gradually unified by 1992 but the eastern rail workers joined the 
western union of german rail workers months ago 
they demand immediate raises to 50 percent to 60 percent of 
levels in western germany and protection against the layoffs 
expected in many eastern industries last week management said it 
anticipated laying off 68000 eastern rail workers 
the union says western rail workers get about 675 a month more 
than their eastern counterparts whose pay ranges from 675 to 945 
a month 
commuter trains and subways were unaffected by the strike but 
its impact extended to western germany and neighboring countries to 
the east 
trains from western german cities such as frankfurt and hamburg 
to berlin and other cities in the east were canceled and hundreds 
of passengers were put on buses instead trains from hungary and 
romania were stopped at the border in czechoslovakia according to 
the czechoslovak news agency ctk 
though the strike affected freight as well as passenger traffic 
the german news agency adn reported that the rail workers were 
still permitting aid shipments for poland and the soviet union 
negotiations between the union and management broke down 
thursday and another round of talks is scheduled for wednesday a 
poll of eastern rail workers ended sunday with 97 percent voting to 
strike 
there have been scattered strikes in eastern germany since 
unification of the germanys on oct 3 but the job action by the 
260000 eastern rail workers was the first major strike in unified 
germany

stanislaw tyminski the political unknown 
whose strong showing in presidential elections shocked observers 
apparently struck a responsive chord among voters disenchanted with 
difficult economic reforms 
tyminski 42 who returned to his homeland this fall after 21 
years in canada and peru finished second in polands first popular 
presidential elections on sunday giving him a spot in the dec 9 
runoff with lech walesa 
walesa finished first in the sixperson field with 40 percent 
but tyminski won an estimated 23 percent of the vote enough to 
shut out prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki who took only 16 
percent in unofficial returns 
in his campaign tyminski promised poles a quick cure for their 
economic woes a pledge he repeated today 
i want to make this country rich and prosperous it will be 
better within a month he told a packed news conference today at 
his headquarters 
tyminski said he was undaunted by the prospect of facing walesa 
who won first fame a decade ago as the leader of solidarity 
i will win these elections otherwise i would not have come 
back tyminski said i am not afraid of walesa i am not afraid 
of anyone 
opponents claim tyminskis economic policies are wildly 
unrealistic critics have also questioned his qualifications his 
canadian and peruvian citizenships his business dealings and his 
leadership of the fringe libertarian party of canada and even his 
mental stability 
for the first month of the campaign tyminski was not treated as 
a serious contender thus escaping media scrutiny and criticism 
from rivals 
he finally got his opponents attention with his accusations 
that the mazowiecki government is selling off the national property 
to foreigners at cutrate prices in its bid to privatize 
floundering stateowned companies 
tyminski also spent liberally on campaign advertisements served 
refreshments at some events and campaigned hard 
his appeal may have been bolstered by dissatisfaction with both 
mazowiecki and walesa onetime solidarity allies turned political 
foes but after the polling both the mazowiecki and walesa camps 
agreed on one thing they were alarmed by tyminskis showing 
walesa strategist lech kaczynski solidaritys deputy chairman 
called tyminski a dangerous phenomenon 
andrzej wielowieyski a senator allied with mazowiecki called 
tyminski an opportunity for escape whose showing was an 
alarming signal 
tyminski has revealed a black hole in polish society said 
wladyslaw frasyniuk a chief mazowiecki campaigner it is the 
result to put it bluntly of darkness stupidity a lack of 
experience in democracy 
a state television exit poll suggested tyminski garnered strong 
support among the farm and smalltown population political 
analysts said the discontent of the poles who voted for tyminski 
has to be taken seriously 
i want to warn about making light of this electorate said 
stefan bratkowski a wellknown commentator it is not an 
electorate of stupid people it is an electorate of disappointed 
people 
polish election law drafted in the year since communism was 
toppled allowed any candidate who could gather 100000 signatures 
to appear on the ballot it did not for example require that a 
candidate live in poland

the foreign ministry said today iraqs failure to 
free 1000 soviets could lead to a tougher attitude toward 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin demanded the immediate 
release of the soviets he also told reporters foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze met with foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq 
for four hours today to reiterate the demand that iraq withdraws 
its troops from kuwait 
churkin said foreign minister saud alfaisal of saudi arabia 
would meet with shevardnadze on tuesday to discuss the persian gulf 
crisis 
he said iraq agree to allow 1000 soviets mostly contract 
workers to leave during november but that only about 350 were 
permitted to do so 
when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 there were about 8000 
soviets including several hundred military advisers in iraq 
about 3000 soviets including women and children were allowed to 
leave shortly after the invasion and about 1000 left during 
september and october 
churkin said iraq agreed to allow another 1000 to leave in 
november but is not living up to its promise iraq is not 
keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from 
leaving he said this is totally abnormal and unacceptable 
he added if iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and 
allow our citizens to leave this will complicate the present 
situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude 
churkin said that to his knowledge no soviets were being 
detained at potential military targets all soviet nationals 
are still where they were before the crisis he said 
iraq has prevented hundreds of foreigners from leaving iraq and 
kuwait since saddam husseins troops overran the emirate four 
months ago it has been slowly releasing some foreigners

the annual fall gathering of bald eagles at 
glacier national park once a natural wonder that awed thousands 
has disappeared a victim of mans tinkering with nature 
while human blunder destroyed the birds feeding on salmon at 
glacier 200 miles to the south another attempt to modify nature 
has provided a new food source and a new eagle gathering area 
just a few years ago the ark in northwestern montana was 
considered one of the best places in america to view bald eagles in 
the fall salmon swarmed upstream to spawn in the parks lake 
mcdonald and migrating eagles by the hundreds paused to perch in 
trees and feed on fish 
tourists jammed viewing areas where it was common to see six of 
the threatened birds per tree just 100 feet away 
but in 1986 the salmon run collapsed after an attempt to 
enhance the salmon population backfired 
a tiny creature called the mysis shrimp was introduced about 20 
years ago by the state department of fish wildlife and parks into 
nearby flathead lake with the idea that it would be a new food 
source for the salmon instead the mysis competed for plankton 
that salmon eat and the salmon population dwindled 
once there were more than 100000 spawning salmon in the creek 
every fall park officials say this fall there were only about 
200 
as the salmon disappeared so did the eagles in 1981 the peak 
count was 639 bald eagles in the lake mcdonald area last year it 
was 25 last week it was 13 
the bald eagles are protected nationwide except in alaska 
where populations thrive federal officials estimate there were 
2660 nesting pairs in the lower 48 states last year 
eagles are opportunistic feeders said glacier park 
spokeswoman amy vanderbilt if there arent salmon theyre not 
going to hang around theyre going to go where theres food 
riley mcclelland a park research biologist said many of the 
birds still fly over but none of them are stopping most of them 
are simply passing through the birds are migratory and many are 
believed to spend part of the year in canada and part in mexico 
the loss of the eagles has cost the area tourists mcclelland 
said 46500 people used to come and watch the eagles in october and 
november last year only 1000 people visited during the same 
period 
meanwhile at canyon ferry reservoir just east of helena an 
experiment with kokanee salmon also went awry but with beneficial 
results salmon stocked for fishermen escaped from the reservoir 
and made their way into the missouri river below where they began 
spawning 
the booming salmon population has attracted so many eagles that 
officials have closed part of the river to protect their nests and 
feeding ground more than 200 bald eagles are there now five years 
ago observers say perhaps half a dozen stopped there 
the new group dont appear to have come from glacier mcclelland 
said only a few banded glacier eagles have shown up at canyon 
ferry 
whatever their origin the majestic birds attracted tourists as 
word of the new gathering spread 
pat gubbins a regional manager with the state wildlife and 
parks department said more than 600 people have flocked to the 
site nearly each weekend this fall plus hundreds more during the 
week

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that state officials may be sued for shutting down a daycare 
center without giving the owner a chance to respond to charges of 
child abuse and overcrowding 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by arizona 
officials seeking immunity from a lawsuit by a tucson daycare 
center 
the arizona office of child protective services investigated the 
chalkboard inc center after tucson police received a complaint in 
1985 that a young girl was sexually abused by a teacher there 
the investigators said they discovered at least one other 
complaint of sexual abuse against the same teacher learned of 
several complaints of physical abuse of the children and found 
overcrowding despite an earlier warning to chalkboard 
the investigators also said the teacher accused of sexual abuse 
had been suspended and that there was evidence the physical abuse 
had been halted two months earlier 
within a week of the preliminary investigation and eight days 
before a scheduled hearing on the charges officials suspended 
chalkboards license to operate 
the centers owner karen hoyt sued the state officials for 
violating her dueprocess rights by shutting down the center 
without a hearing or a court order 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in may refused to kill her 
suit the appeals court rejected arguments by the officials that 
they are entitled to immunity because they acted swiftly to protect 
the children 
the appeals court said the officials ignored state law that 
required dueprocess for the day care center in such circumstances 
arizona has provided procedures requiring notice and 
hearing in the absence of a showing of actual emergency the 
appeals court said in ignoring these procedures reasonable 
officials would have known that their actions were not lawful 
the appeals court sent the case back to a lower court for 
further proceedings that could lead to an award of monetary damages 
against the officials 
twentytwo states urged the justices to hear arizonas appeal 
and give state officials broader protection against being sued the 
states are alabama arkansas connecticut florida hawaii idaho 
kentucky michigan minnesota missouri montana nebraska new 
hampshire new jersey new mexico north carolina north dakota

a shiite moslem group has claimed 
reponsibility for what it said were violent student protests in 
iraq against saddam hussein 
the statement by the lebanon branch of the supreme council of 
the islamic revolution in iraq was published today by the middle 
east reporter an english language daily newsletter based in 
beirut 
the group is believed linked to the dawa party an opposition 
group formed by imam mohammed baqr sadr the shiite spiritual 
leader of iraq who was executed by saddam 10 years ago 
the statement said selected units of martyr sadrs cubs waged 
as of november a widespread campaign of resistance against saddams 
aggressive policies 
the campaign included distribution of antigovernment leaflets 
in schools in baghdad and the iraqi cities of kofa basra amara 
kirkuk and irbil the statement said it said the leaflets urged 
iraqi troops to rebel against the regime 
iraqs official news agency has referred recently to student 
unrest and arrests but given no details the statement published 
in beirut was the first to claim responsibility for recent iraqi 
unrest 
the statement claimed more than 4500 people most of them 
students were arrested after bloody clashes with knives and 
daggers on nov 7 and 15 in baghdad and several other parts of 
iraq 
it asked international humanitarian organizations to intervene 
to prevent saddam from executing the detainees who the statement 
said were tortured 
the dawa party is shiite saddam is a sunni moslem 
the 17 bombers who were jailed in kuwait for blowing up the us 
and french embassies in the emirate in 1983 belong to the dawa 
party two of the 17 were released last year there has been no 
word on the others fate following the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the release of the bombers has been sought by shiites holding 
most of the 13 western hostages in lebanon including six 
americans

the supreme court today refused to kill an 
affirmative action program in florida aimed at awarding more public 
works contracts to businesses run by minorities and women 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by companies that 
said the tampaarea program is unconstitutional because it condones 
reverse discrimination against white men 
the affirmative action program was adopted in 1984 by 
hillsborough county fla the county set a goal of awarding 25 
percent of the value of all annual construction contracts to 
businesses owned by women and minorities primarily blacks and 
hispanics 
the program in effect calls for county officials to favor 
contractors who have lined up companies run by minorities and women 
as subcontractors 
if the contractor submitting the low bid on a project has met 
the countys affirmative action goals that company is likely to 
win the contract the low bidder may lose the contract if it fails 
to convince officials it has at least made a goodfaith effort to 
meet those goals 
after a group of whiteowned construction companies sued a 
federal judge in 1989 ruled the program was unconstitutional and 
barred the county from enforcing it 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals overruled the judge last 
august and reinstated the program the appeals court said the 
program at least on its face does not violate equalprotection 
guarantees 
but the appeals court did not throw out the suit but instead 
sent it back for a trial at which the whiteowned companies will 
have a chance to prove their allegations 
the appeals court said the hillsborough plan appears to be 
significantly different from a socalled setaside program adopted 
by richmond va that was overturned by the supreme court last 
year 
the richmond plan established a quota that required 30 percent 
of the value of annual public works contracts to be awarded to 
minority businesses 
in striking down that plan the high court said local 
governments must narrowly tailor affirmative action plans to remedy 
proven past bias 
the 11th circuit court said hillsborough county acted only after 
a sixyear wholly voluntary plan failed to do enough to help 
minorities and women in the building industry 
unlike richmond hillsborough county decided to implement its 
law based on statistics indicating that there was discrimination 
specifically in the construction business commissioned by the 
county the appeals court said 
it noted that the county shunned rigid quotas and only adopted 
flexible goals for awarding contracts to minorities and women 
another plus for the county program is that most of the 
contracts are intended to go to struggling smaller companies the 
appeals court added 
the companies that challenged the plan said it is designed to 
achieve racial balance without proof of past discrimination against 
women and minorities in the construction industry 
the case is cone corp vs hillsborough county 90587

the nations nuclear power industry today lost 
a supreme court effort to scuttle anticipated federal rules for the 
training of nuclear plant workers 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand a federal 
appeals court ruling that forces the nuclear regulatory commission 
to issue such binding rules 
only justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
the appeals court said congress intended to have binding rules 
imposed when it enacted the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 the 
law requires regulations or other appropriate commission 
regulatory guidance for training nuclear power plant workers 
but lawyers for the nuclear power industry contend the 
commission complied with the 1982 law when it issued a policy 
statement in 1985 endorsing the industrys selfimprovement 
safety program 
the dispute has its roots in the 1979 accident at the three mile 
island nuclear plant in pennsylvania 
a presidential commission appointed to investigate the accident 
concluded among other things that inadequate training of nuclear 
plant employees increased the risk of future accidents 
the nuclear industry created an independent organization to 
bring about selfimprovement according to the nuclear management 
and resources council comprising all utilities holding operating 
or construction permits for nuclear plants the industry spent 
hundreds of millions of dollars to expand and refine the 
training and accreditation program 
a coalition of groups sued the nuclear regulatory commission in 
1986 seeking to have binding rules imposed on the nuclear 
industrys training efforts the industrys nuclear management and 
resources council was allowed to intervene as a defendant 
the original lawsuit was dismissed for having been filed too 
late 
but after the commission revised its policy statement in 1988 
the coalition of groups again sued over the commissions failure to 
impose binding rules 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
ruled last april that the commission had not complied with the 1982 
laws provision for regulations or other appropriate regulatory 
guidance 
the full appeals court later refused to reconsider the april 
decision but several judges noted that the commission could 
devise regulations that preserve most if not all of the 
flexibility the commission sought in its 1985 policy statement 
the nuclear industrys council then sought supreme court review 
arguing that the appeals court ruling threatens nuclear safety 
this is not a case in which an industry is simply 
attempting to evade wholesome regulations the appeal said 
uniform adherence to the highest safety standards must 
involve the industry in setting and policing its own standards of 
excellence 
lawyers for the coalition of groups that pressed for binding 
rules urged the justices to reject the appeal 
the federal commission which did not appeal the appeals court 
ruling to the supreme court told the justices it did not oppose 
the nuclear industrys appeal 
the case is nuclear management and resources council vs public 
citizen 90360

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether state judges may be forced to retire at age 70 
the court said it will hear arguments by two missouri judges 
that their states mandatory retirement age violates federal law 
and unconstitutionally treats them differently than other missouri 
employees 
the st louisbased 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last 
march that a federal law banning age discrimination in employment 
does not apply to state court judges 
the appeals court upholding a ruling by us district judge 
william hungate said missouris state court judges fall into the 
antibias laws exception for appointees on the policymaking 
level 
the appeals court also ruled that the states mandatory 
retirement age is constitutional because it is a rational way to 
ensure a vigorous and healthy judiciary and to increase 
opportunities for younger people to serve as judges 
the 8th circuit courts ruling appears to conflict with a 
decision announced two months later by the new yorkbased 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals that allowed a 71yearold state judge 
from vermont to remain on the bench 
the 2nd circuit court ruled that appointed state judges are not 
appointees on the policymaking level and therefore are 
protected by the federal antibias law 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for missouri judges ellis 
gregory jr and anthony nugent jr urged the justices to resolve 
the conflicting rulings 
the supreme court has never ruled on the issue but in 1988 left 
intact new yorks policy of forcing elected judges to retire at age 
70 even though no such mandatory retirement is imposed on appointed 
judges in the state 
lawyers for gregory and nugent contend that forcing judges and 
no other state employees in physically undemanding jobs to retire 
at age 70 violates judges constitutional right to equal treatment 
the case is gregory vs ashcroft 9050

don geronimo vela 73 hitched up his 
pants a notch pulled down his cowboy hat and said we are going 
to be proud to have president bush here but president bush will be 
proud to be in agualeguas 
welcome president bush to president carlos salinas de 
gortaris northern mexico hometown fiercely regionalist friendly 
and open as the skies it shares with the us southwest 
bush was to arrive this afternoon for talks with salinas and 
travel to nearby monterrey in the evening for more discussions 
nearly 5000 people live in this farming and cattle community of 
stone homes some are from families that arrived in the mid1600s 
the towns name comes from the gualeguas indians one of a few 
groups of seminomadic tribes that lived in the region when the 
spaniards came 
the salinas and lozano families the two sides of the 
presidents lineage are believed to have settled in agualeguas 
with a group of 12 spanish families in the late 1700s 
the large old onestory salinas home sits across the street 
from don geronimos home just around the corner from the main 
plaza the location indicates that the owners were among the towns 
first families 
they are good people said don geronimo don raul the 
presidents father always has been a very decent man a man of the 
people who came here to rest and visit whenever he had a chance 
even when he was a high government official 
raul salinas served as a senator congressman and commerce 
secretary 
he always brought his children with him i remember the 
president being a rather quiet shy boy at the time don geronimo 
said 
president salinas was born in mexico city but he always comes 
back to his family roots and spends long holidays and vacations in 
agualeguas 
we are proud of him said ernesto vazquez who owns a small 
grocery story and claims he sells some of the best homemade beef 
jerky in northern mexico 
someone from a town nearby said the other day salinas was not 
even born here and we should not brag about him but i think there 
is even more merit in the fact that he wants to be from here 
vazquez said 
i think the visit here is like when you invite a friend to 
your home then they go to monterrey to talk about serious 
matters don geronimo said 
i am going to sit on my porch and watch it all i hope 
everything goes well bush has too many things to worry about now 
but we want him to feel at home here 
it will be close agualeguas is like a lot of mexican towns near 
the us border that have a constant interchange with their 
northern neighbor country 
we understand the united states and we understand americans 
said mauro martinez high school teacher and city chronicler 
vazquez offered us brand beer at his grocery store while on 
the sidewalks outside his young nephews and nieces in town on a 
short visit chatted in english 
many agualeguas residents work or live temporarily in the united 
states but come home regularly for visits martinez said 
they are not unlike the salinases he said they want to 
come back to their roots it is an emotional thing

only days before a un security council vote on 
the use of force in the persian gulf the united states has 
effectively ended a moratorium on highlevel exchanges with china 
chinese officials today announced that the united states had 
invited a chinese vice minister of trade to visit next month he 
will be the highestranking chinese to make an official visit to 
the united states since the june 1989 crushing of chinas democracy 
movement 
word of the planned visit came as the us embassy in beijing 
announced that chinese foreign minister qian qichen will travel to 
new york to cast chinas vote on a un security council resolution 
allowing the use of force against iraq 
us embassy spokesman sheridan w bell said today the chinese 
government had notified the embassy of qians plans to come to new 
york for the un vote the chinese foreign ministry asked for 
confirmation did not immediately respond 
the united states has been engaged in an intensive international 
lobbying campaign to win support for the resolution which would 
authorize the use of force to dislodge iraq from kuwait which it 
seized aug 2 
china as a permanent security council member could veto the 
measure a vote on the resolution is expected sometime this week 
bell refused to discuss details of talks between beijing and 
washington on the resolution we are in regular contact with the 
chinese on a whole range of diplomatic issues he said to my 
knowledge we still dont know how the chinese are going to 
respond to a vote on the resolution 
in keeping with chinas longstanding opposition to superpower 
intervention in regional issues chinese officials have urged 
exhaustive efforts for a peaceful solution they have refused to 
say publicly how china will vote on the resolution 
however us officials have said they do not expect china or 
the soviet union which is also a permanent member of the security 
council to block the measure moscow also has been reluctant to 
allow force 
chinas international standing has improved greatly since the 
persian gulf crisis began because of beijings support for 
resolutions against iraq this has spurred the bush 
administrations efforts to resume normal relations with china 
the united states had joined other western countries and japan 
in imposing sanctions to punish china for its june 1989 army attack 
on studentled protesters for democratic reform among other 
things the sanctions halted highlevel exchanges 
the forthcoming visit was announced today by the ministry of 
foreign economic relations and trade it said its vice minister gu 
yongjiang will visit the united states from dec 1014 at the 
invitation of commerce department undersecretary j michael farren 
although there was no formal us announcement by inviting gu 
the bush administration effectively ends its own moratorium gus 
trip falls in the category of those banned since june 1989 
japan and the european community already have sent 
ministeriallevel officials to beijing but washington has not 
announced any such plans 
washington had violated its own ban once when it sent national 
security adviser brent scowcroft to beijing in november 1989 
otherwise the only highlevel contacts since june 1989 have 
been at the united nations and in third countries 
secretary of state james a baker iii met qian in cairo in early 
november for example washington said such meetings were not 
covered by the sanction 
other sanctions also have eroded the united states has resumed 
importexport bank loans to china and dropped its opposition to 
world bank loans the ec and japan have resumed lowinterest 
government loans 
a ban on arms sales remains the only clearcut western sanction 
against china

tens of thousands of workers walked off 
their jobs today responding to an appeal by the opposition trad 
union for a general strike aimed at forcing socialist premier 
andrei lukanov to resign 
there were conflicting reports about the extent of the protest 
but the walkout called by the podkrepa labor federation was 
apparently limited to about 10 percent of the nations work force 
of 45 million 
the political tension in this country has reached threatening 
dimensions and its further escalation is impermissible valentin 
stoyanov spokesman for president zhelyu zhelev said on bulgarian 
radio 
zhelev called on the socialists formerly the communists and 
the opposition to meet today to negotiate a plan to bring the 
balkan country out of its political and economic crisis 
lukanovs government had said the strike would be illegal the 
action started at 6 am but it was unclear how long it would 
last 
podkrepa announced the strike last week as demands intensified 
for the resignation of lukanov and his former communist associates 
bulgarias main trade union organization the socialistbacked 
confederation of independent unions said sunday it would not back 
the strike both unions claim hundreds of thousands of members 
the opposition alliance in parliament the union of democratic 
forces said it would hold a rally tuesday in support of the 
strike 
podkrepa which means support is a nonactive nonvoting 
member of the union of democratic forces to counter socialist 
charges that it is a political organization rather than a trade 
union 
the socialist party successor to the former communist party 
won june elections but the continuing economic decline and 
shortages of basic foods and consumer goods have led to growing 
demands for lukanovs resignation and daily protests against the 
government 
lukanov and his government narrowly survived a noconfidence 
vote in parliament on friday that capped months of wrangling 
between the governing socialists and the opposition over how to 
revive the economy 
the state news agency bta some of whose staff joined todays 
strike said that about half a million people walked off the job 
podkrepas deputy chairman toncho ivanov said earlier the 
strike was strongest among miners and health workers throughout the 
country he claims his union has 350000 members 
podkrepa members were on strike in 30 enterprises in sofia and 
in 40 in plovdiv bulgarias secondlargest city bta said it 
quoted krustyu krustev chairman of the podkrepa national strike 
committee 
symbolic or full strike actions were in progress in many other 
bulgarian cities bta said 
deputy premier nora ananieva told bulgarian radio that by and 
large economic enterprises were functioning normally and that 
strikes were isolated to individual cities and enterprises 
she denied reports that a main petrochemical combine in burgas 
on the black sea and a metallurgical plant near sofia were on 
strike 
rail air and maritime traffic were working normally ananieva 
said adding that with the exception of several bus lines city 
transport in sofia was also in operation 
in a television appearance sunday the leader of the podkrepa 
trade union konstantin trenchev said the government must resign 
if it cannot achieve a minimum standard of living for its 
population 
in a seprate televised statement lukanov warned that a strike 
would hurt the economy even more and could lead to further unrest 
he urged citizens not to support the adventurers who in their 
greed for power are prepared to push bulgaria onto the fatal path 
of civic conflict 
god wont fill the shops but the strike will certainly empty 
them lukanov said 
many basic foodstuffs are scarce or beingrrationed an energy 
crisis has led to periodic power cuts

margaret thatcher set the example of what a woman 
could achieve in british society but her critics say she did 
little else to help women along 
for some it was enough that her political career reached the 
heights 
one woman wrote to the independent newspaper last week that her 
7yearold daughter wondered what title mrs thatchers successor 
would hold since he couldnt be called prime minister thats a 
girls name 
emma nicholson a conservative party lawmaker said it was once 
unthinkable that a woman would ever be a british prime minister 
she has broken the mold once and forever ms nicholson said in 
an interview 
mrs thatcher who trained as a chemist before studying law 
said she viewed herself as prime minister not as a woman she 
believed the battle for womens rights had been largely won and was 
no believer in feminism 
what has it ever done for me she once asked 
mrs thatcher who stepped down on thursday urged women to get 
involved in politics but did little to pull them up the ladder 
several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive 
posts in various ministries but the only woman to serve in a 
thatcher cabinet was baroness young leader of the house of lords 
from 1981 to 1983 
the truth is that although mrs thatcher is a woman she 
doesnt believe in the advancement of women clare short a labor 
party lawmaker said last month 
edwina currie a former junior health minister said any other 
prime minister would have had several women in and out of the 
cabinet 
its margarets fault that the only people standing to 
succeed her wear trousers mrs currie said last week trree men 
are vying to succeed her as conservative party leader and thus 
prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for tuesday 
traditional male attitudes remain strong in britain from the 
uppercrust allmale clubs of london to the topless women pictured 
daily in the tabloid press 
women are paid less than men and are poorly represented in 
management jobs and in parliament 
however campaigners for women rights say there are encouraging 
signs at the grassroots 
the critical mass of women have entered middle management in 
government and business said lesley abdela a founding member of 
the 300 group 
the group seeks equal representation for women in the 650seat 
house of commons which now has 43 female members 
women represented 43 percent of the british labor force in 1988 
compared with 40 percent in 1979 when mrs thatcher became prime 
minister britain has a higher proportion of working women than 
other european community countries 
though mrs thatcher never made a priority of womens issues 
she did introduce some helpful legislation tax concessions for 
workplace nurseries independent taxation for married women and 
legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits 
but as prime minister she angered feminists by often 
emphasizing womens traditional roles of homemakers and 
caregivers 
angela rumbold the conservative partys minister for womens 
issues contends that an enormous amount has been done for 
women during the thatcher years 
im not sure what she could have gone beyond promoting people 
who were there just because they were women she said in an 
interview margaret thatcher is a great meritocrat she believes 
in getting people to succeed on their merits 
jo hawkins of the 300 group which is seeking equal numbers of 
women in the house of commons believes mrs thatchers 
extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the 
needs of the average woman 
she would say that anybody can do it just stick to your 
principles and get up and do it ms hawkins said i think 
because of her character her personality and her amazing 
selfconfidence she isnt aware of how the normal person 
struggles

the supreme court today refused to consider 
curtailing dramatically the power of federal courts to review 
criminal defendants state court convictions 
the justices without comment turned away a florida case in 
which prosecutors asked them to bar most convicted defendants from 
going into federal court with claims that their socalled miranda 
rights were violated 
in its famous miranda vs arizona decision in 1966 the high 
court said criminal suspects in police custody may not be 
interrogated unless told of their rights to remain silent to have 
a lawyers help and to have a lawyer appointed for them if they 
cannot afford one 
confessions or other evidence obtained in violation of the 
miranda ruling which was based on the constitutions fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination cannot be used at 
trial 
florida prosecutors urged the court to rule that defendants 
given a full and fair chance in state courts to mount a miranda 
challenge to the use of incriminating evidence be barred from 
carrying such challenges to federal courts 
the court in 1976 shut down such federal court access for 
convicted defendants given a fair and full chance in state courts 
to challenge evidence allegedly obtained unlawfully by police the 
fourth amendment bans unreasonable police searches and seizures 
over the past decade the justices several times declined 
invitations to extend the 1976 decision reached in a case called 
stone vs powell to criminal law areas outside the fourth 
amendment context 
but in a 1989 case decided on other grounds two justices 
sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia voted to extend the ban on 
federal court access to such miranda challenges 
in the case acted on today the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals last april threw out jack townes state court conviction 
and the 22year prison sentence it drew 
the appeals court ruled that townes confessions had been 
obtained in violation of his fifth amendment right because police 
continued to question towne without trying to clarify an 
equivocal request for an attorney 
towne was arrested dec 4 1984 for loitering and prowling at 
an apartment complex near his home in gainesville fla 
at the police station an officer questioned towne about several 
rapes and burglaries that had occurred recently in the same area 
after towne made some incriminating statements the officer 
called in a detective who questioned towne for an additional three 
hours 
towne subsequently pleaded no contest to charges of battery 
sexual battery armed robbery and armed burglary but he reserved 
his right to appeal a state judges refusal to suppress his 
confessions as evidence 
after state appeals courts ruled that townes confessions were 
obtained in compliance with his miranda rights he turned to the 
federal courts for help 
a federal trial judge ruled against him but the 11th circuit 
court threw out his conviction 
the appeals court noted that at one point towne said to the 
police officer who first questioned him what do you think about 
whether i should get a lawyer 
questions such as the one posed by towne are equivocal 
requests that require clarification before investigating officers 
initiate any further questioning the appeals court ruled 
the case is dugger vs towne 90345

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that a state may limit how much money a candidate receives from 
political committees 
the court without comment rejected arguments that such a 
wisconsin campaign financing law violates freespeech rights 
the constitutionality of the law was challenged by john gard a 
republican state assemblyman who was fined 500 for violating its 
limits in 1987 other gop officials in the state joined his 
challenge 
gard received 18820 from committees in his campaign that year 
7607 over the limit 
the law places a cap on the total a candidate may receive from 
all committees including political action committees pacs run by 
special interests and partyrelated committees 
gard and his allies said the law violates the freespeech rights 
of committees that may be barred from making even symbolic 
contributions to candidates who have reached the limit 
they also said the law violates the candidates freespeech 
rights by in effect limiting the amount of money he or she may 
spend 
the supreme court in 1976 upheld federal campaign financing 
regulations limiting contributions to candidates but the high 
court struck down provisions restricting campaign expenditures 
the wisconsin supreme court in june relied heavily on the 1976 
ruling in upholding the state law 
there is a compelling state interest in placing an aggregate 
limit on the contributions that an individual candidate may receive 
from allccommittees the state court said the purpose is 
to limit the impact of huge special interest contributions on a 
candidate and to encourage a broad and diverse base of support in 
order to prevent either actual corruption or the appearance of 
corruption 
the state court said it is necessary to apply the limit to all 
committees not just pacs to prevent special interests from 
laundering contributions by funneling them through 
partyrelated committees 
the aggregate limit encourages candidates to seek 
contributions from a greater number of sources and to compel people 
who would otherwise contribute amounts greater than the statutory 
limits to expend such funds on direct political expression the 
wisconsin court said 
it said laws in at least five other states hawaii montana 
arizona louisiana and california impose similar restrictions 
the case is gard vs wisconsin elections board 90536

richard b kelly the former florida 
congressman who served 13 months in prison for his abscam bribery 
conviction in 1981 today lost a supreme court appeal in which he 
said new evidence shows he was denied a fair trial 
the court without comment left intact rulings that threw out 
kellys latest appeal 
kelly now 66 and living in stevensville mont was one of 
seven members of congress convicted in the fbis abscam undercover 
operation 
kelly represented the tampa area for three terms but lost a 1980 
reelection bid after he was indicted 
the jury that convicted him had watched a videotape of kelly 
stuffing his pockets with 100 bills given to him by an fbi agent 
posing as an aide to a nonexistent arab sheik 
kelly said he accepted 25000 from phony arabs who said they 
had immigration problems because he was conducting his own 
investigation of shady characters 
kelly was imprisoned from nov 1 1985 to nov 28 1986 at the 
minimumsecurity federal prison camp on eglin air force base in the 
florida panhandle and at the suncoast rehabilitation center in st 
petersburg 
in the appeal acted on today kelly contended that a former fbi 
informant james davenport stole key defense documents from his 
capitol hill office in august 1980 and gave the documents to 
federal prosecutors 
kelly said the new evidence about davenports theft entitles him 
to a new trial 
a federal trial judge and the us circuit court of appeals here 
previously rejected kellys appeal

the supreme court today rejected a challenge 
to the seizure by us customs agents of some 2700 allegedly 
obscene magazines shipped from cleveland and denied entry into 
canada 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that the 
magazines could be treated as imports from a foreign country once 
they were headed back to cleveland 
trans world news co of cleveland shipped on three occasions in 
1987 some 0000 magazines to canada for north american news in 
toronto about 10000 of the magazines were rejected at the 
canadian border by officials who deemed them too sexually explicit 
and offensive to canadian standards 
when those magazines were returned customs agents in western 
new york seized and confiscated 2703 of them after determining 
they probably were obscene under the standards of that part of the 
country 
the magazines were seized under a federal law banning the import 
of obscene materials 
us district judge john t curtin in buffalo upheld the seizure 
and confiscation despite arguments by trans world news lawyers that 
the magazines were not imports because they never had reached their 
canadian destination 
the 2nd us circuit upheld curtins ruling last july whether 
the magazines were accepted into canada or denied entry and held by 
canadian customs is irrelevant the appeals court said 
it added regardless of their fate in canada the 
objectionable publications were presented at the united states 
border for entry into the united states from without when they were 
seized 
the case is 1903 obscene magazines vs us 90642

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
new york parental rights law that barred many men from vetoing the 
adoptions of their illegitimate children 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling by new yorks 
highest court that the law violated fathers constitutional rights 
until a 1979 ruling by the nations highest court fathers of 
children born out of wedlock had no parental rights 
but in a series of decisions since the court has said an unwed 
father may challenge a mothers putting the child up for adoption 
if he has manifested a significant paternal interest in the 
child 
under the invalidated new york law a significant paternal 
interest had to be proved in three ways 
the father had to have lived with the mother or the child 
during the six months before the child was placed for adoption 
he had to openly acknowledge his fatherhood 
he had to have paid for pregnancy and birth expenses 
in striking down the law last july the new york court of 
appeals said the requirement that the father openly live 
with the mother before a childs placement for adoption neither 
legitimately furthers the states interest nor sufficiently protect 
that fathers and the law must therefore be declared 
unconstitutional 
the july ruling cast doubt on the proposed adoption by a nashua 
nh couple of a girl born out of wedlock in white plains ny 
two years ago 
lower courts had ruled that the adoption could be finalized 
without the consent of the childs biological father 
the little girl raquel marie was born may 26 1988 to a woman 
identified in court documents only as louise n the childs 
biological father is identified only as miguel t 
when raquel marie was 2 months old her mother consented to the 
girls adoption by the new hampshire couple identified as robert 
and ana c 
raquel has lived in nashua ever since but in november 1988 
louise n and miguel t reconciled and were married they opposed 
the asyet completed adoption 
louise and miguel had met while students at eastchester high 
school in the suburban new york city area 
they had their first child a girl named lauren in 1986 but 
the couple lived together only a brief time in 1987 according to 
court documents they had a stormy relationship and miguel t on 
several occasions had been so physically abusive that louise n 
needed medical treatment 
since challenging raquels adoption louise n and miguel t 
have separated 
the case is robert and ana c vs miguel t and louise n

involved in a bitter divorce dispute between jazz saxophonist stan 
getz and his wife of 32 years 
the justices without comment rejected arguments by monica getz 
that new yorks divorce law violates the rights of women 
getz 63 sued for divorce in 1981 after mrs getz 56 went to 
court alleging her husband suffering from alcoholism and drug 
addiction abused her she sought a court order for family support 
payments and protection against getz 
the couple later made attempts at reconciliation before the 
divorce became final in 1987 a state jury ruled in getzs favor in 
granting the divorce he had accused his wife of infidelity and 
trying to poison him 
mrs getz said her husband had been repeatedly unfaithful and 
unpredictably violent but said she stood by him when drugs and 
alcohol could have cost him his life 
a state judge ruled that mrs getz is entitled to half her 
husbands royalties from the beginning of their marriage in 1956 to 
1981 that ruling was not at issue in the case acted on today 
in her appeal to the supreme court mrs getz said the divorce 
decree against her is unfair she said the case should have been 
resolved in new yorks family courts rather than by trial courts 
that handle corporate disputes and other matters 
she said the state law favors men by permitting them to wage 
legal wars of attrition against their wives who often lack 
equal financial resources 
family courts are designed to expedite resolutions of divorce 
cases and spare the couple excessive legal fees she said 
mrs getz said she has spent more than 600000 in legal fees 
and will be forced to use the proceeds from the couples mansion in 
irvington ny where she still lives to pay off the bills 
in a legal brief in her behalf mrs getzs lawyer whitney 
north seymour jr said the wifes entire life has been left in 
shambles by this case she has been branded an adulteress she has 
become obligated to pay legal fees of many hundreds of thousands of 
dollars she is being forced out of her home and to give up her 
oldage security 
the case is getz vs getz 90562

police in the pacific island nation are allowed again to take the 
law into their own hands

slightly larger than california has been an independent member of 
the 50nation commonwealth of britain and its former colonies since 
1975

the opposition bougainville revolutionary army in early 1989 a 
state of emergency was imposed in june of that year 
they bombed and raided more than 40 villages burning houses 
beating and sexually abusing villagers and killing dozens of 
people including children as young as three months said the 
groups 50page report 
soldiers killed dozens of unarmed civilians they suspected of 
supporting the armed opposition and tortured scores of others 
before government security forces were withdrawn from bougainville 
in march of this year the report said 
the human rights group called for an impartial authority to 
investigate the allegations 
amnesty international also said the papua new guinea government 
took few steps to stop or investigate the human rights violations 
on bougainville 
there were frequent violations during states of emergency 
imposed in different parts of the country which gave sweeping 
powers and immunity from prosecution to troops and police the 
report said

government workers and villagers were among the victims during the 
counterinsurgency operation on bougainville

officer another man was beaten so badly he had to have a leg 
amputated and he later died and a pastor and five of his 
congregation were seized on the street beaten stripped and shot 
to death the report said 
it gave details of illtreatment torture and killings and 
identified a number of victims the group said it had 
welldocumented evidence that 19 people died in apparent 
extrajudicial executions or after torture 
the report said its findings were supported by medical records 
autopsy reports testimony from victims and eyewitnesses press 
accounts and government documents 
the group said it knew of only one soldier who was brought to 
justice for the abuses in the two years since they first became 
known

briefing that coincided with a fourhour meeting in moscow between 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and the iraqi 
foreign minister 
churkin said iraq allowed 350 soviets to depart this month 
adding 
if iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and allow our 
citizens to leave this will complicate the present situation even 
further and force us to take a tougher attitude 
in other developments 
the iraqi parliament voted to free the 58 swedes remaining in 
iraq the swedish embassy in baghdad reported the vote requires 
approval from saddam the embassy said iraq freed more than 100

the security council prepared for this weeks debate on the persian 
gulf crisis 
the resolution was given to the other permanent members of the 
security council great britain france chia and the soviet 
union any one permanent member has the power to block it 
us officials have said they did not expect the soviet union 
and china to veto such a resolution but raised the possibility 
they would seek softer language the soviets and others who 
counseled more diplomacy have urged the bush administration to be 
patient for at least two more months 
iraq said the proposed un resolution will not force it to give 
up any of the land it seized aug 2 
if anybody believes that this newest resolution will influence 
our position or force us to abandon our rights they are completely 
wrong the ruling baath party said in its daily newspaper 
althawra 
the newspaper said the united states is using terrorism 
threats and blackmail to try to win approval of the resolution 
the united states is seeking a un vote this week because its 
onemonth presidency of the council ends friday taking over is the 
red sea state of yemen which has supported iraq in the past

lech walesa won the first round in 
presidential elections but in a startling upset prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki was shut out of next months runoff by a 
wealthy enigmatic emigre 
mazowiecki met with his government today to decide whether to 
resign and a secretary in his office said there would be a 
decision tonight she refused to give her name 
walesa the favorite in sundays balloting had 39 percent of 
the vote with all 49 provinces reporting 
the emigre businessman stanislaw tyminski won 23 percent to 
mazowieckis 18 percent according to provincial election 
commission results reported by the official pap news agency three 
minor candidates split the rest turnout was about 60 percent 
it was a stunning setback for mazowiecki the east blocs first 
noncommunist head of government who during 15 months in office 
had spearheaded an economic shock therapy reform program 
mazowiecki survived in office 15 months after becoming the east 
blocs first noncommunist head of government he had said he would 
quit as prime minister and move into political opposition if he 
lost the election 
it was unclear whether he would support his former solidarity 
ally walesa in the runoff 
walesa told reporters at solidarity headquarters in gdansk today 
that he is hesitating about contesting the dec 9 runoff with 
tyminski and said he does not consider him a serious man 
i wouldnt like to run but one has to think over what is good 
for poland walesa said for the last 10 years i was at the 
helm of polish reforms there were victims and sacrifices and it 
wouldnt be proper to leave it now 
the election polands first popular presidential vote was the 
first in eastern europe to focus not on defeating communism but on 
choosing between visions for the postcommunist future 
the new president will take over from gen wojciech jaruzelski 
who ordered martial law to crush solidarity and imprisoned walesa 
and mazowiecki in december 1981 jaruzelski is retiring early to 
complete the democratic transformation the new president will be 
elected to a fiveyear term 
tyminski a 42yearold virtual political unknown returned to 
his homeland this fall after 21 years in canada and peru 
he apparently impressed poles worn by economic hardship and the 
political scrap that split solidarity the freespending head of 
the fringe libertarian party of canada has promised poles a quick 
cure for their economic woes and accused the government of 
incompetence 
tyminski was confident today 
i will win these elections he said as he arrived at his 
headquarters i want to want to make this country rich and 
prosperous it will be better within a month 
he said he knows people in warsaw who are already dying of 
poverty and hunger and offered to provide addresses when 
challenged by reporters 
walesa a shipyard electrician who as solidarity leader 
marshaled the forces that ended four decades of communist rule has 
said it would be horrible to face tyminski in a runoff 
he has described the emigre as a man straight from the bush 
an apparent reference the challengers experiences in perus 
interior 
in the countrys largest newspaper gazeta wyborcza commentator 
piotr pacewicz attributed tyminskis showing to a second poland 
of disaffected rural and smalltown voters he said tyminski 
backers were enticed by this man who arrived clean from 
outside the situation who came from the world of success from 
the americas 
an exit poll by state television indicated that farmers who 
represent 40 percent of polish society deserted mazowiecki en 
masse angry at the abolition of guaranteed prices for their 
produce mazowiecki also fared poorly among workers winning only 
among intellectuals 
dr zofia kuratowska a promazowiecki senator compared 
tyminski to pseudomedical swindlers people trust them and 
not the real medicine mazowiecki was a longtime adviser to 
walesa who last year tapped mazowiecki to become head of the 
government but they had a bitter fallingout and the voting 
climaxed an often acrimonious campaign that splintered solidarity 
the charismatic walesa 47 had contended that mazowiecki was 
too slow in his reforms and called for ridding the government and 
industry of communists 
mazowiecki who has cautioned against witch hunts accused 
walesa of destabilizing the country the 63yearold prime minister 
argued that poland needs his team to stay and finish the job 
through consistent gradual change 
he has accused walesa of making promises he cannot keep and 
some of his backers say walesa would be a demagogue 
ernest skalski a promazowiecki newspaper editor predicted 
walesa would beat tyminski handily but called his strong showing 
a shameful episode in our political history 
it was the first time that poles voted for a president by 
popular election in the past both under communist rule and before 
world war ii presidents were elected by the parliament 
the new president will be head of state and commander of the 
military with powers to nominate the prime minister dissolve 
parliament and declare a state of emergency under strictly defined 
circumstances 
however the presidents powers will be redefined and possibly 
strengthened in a new constitution expected next year when new 
parliamentary elections are also due 
the lower house of the current parliament has a large proportion 
of former communists who were seated last year as part of the 
political deal through which the longruling party ended up ceding 
power to solidarity

poor eyesight does not just happen with 
age most older people maintain good eyesight into their 80s and 
beyond however some physical changes occur during normal aging 
that can cause vision to decline gradually 
because many eye diseases have no early noticeable symptoms you 
should have an examination every two or three years a complete 
exam includes an evaluation of vision and glasses an eye muscle 
check a glaucoma check and a thorough examination of the 
lightsensing nerve tissue that lines tha back of the eye the 
retina 
if you have diabetes or a family history of eye disease you 
should have a thorough eye exam each year if you experience eye 
pain excessive discharge from your eye dry eyes double vision a 
loss or dimming of vision or swelling of the eye or eyelid you 
should make an appointment immediately 
sightsaving treatment is available for those eye diseases that 
are related to aging such as cataracts glaucoma and agerelated 
macular degeneration 
cataracts are cloudy or opaque areas in the eyes lens which is 
normally clear they affect vision by preventing light from passing 
through the lens 
the most common form of cataract is related to aging although 
this type can occur at age 50 or earlier it usually develops 
gradually without pain redness or tearing in the eye 
if a cataract remains small it may not affect vision but if it 
becomes large or dense it can be surgically removed before it 
impairs vision and hampers normal activity cataract surgery is a 
safe procedure and almost always successful 
glaucoma is essentially a plumbing problem in the eye it occurs 
when the fluid in the eyeball drains too slowly without early 
detection and prompt treatment the fluid buildup causes pressure 
inside the eye to rise the result is internal eye damage and a 
gradual loss of vision 
glaucoma has no early symptoms treatment includes special 
eyedrops oral medications laser treatments or in some cases 
surgery 
regular eye exams are important for people whose risk of 
glaucoma is higher than average this includes everyone over 40 
because glaucoma usually begins in middle age or later 
although scientists do not know why aging makes a person more 
susceptible to glaucoma it is clear that risk increases those at 
higher risk also include blacks people with diabetes or high blood 
pressure and people with a family history of glaucoma 
agerelated macular degeneration or amd is a condition in 
which the macula loses its ability to function efficiently the 
macula is the part of the retina that is responsible for sharp 
straightahead and reading vision 
warning signs include blurred vision a distortion or loss of 
central vision you may see a dark spot in the center of your field 
of vision and distortion in vertical lines early detection is 
important because some cases may be treated successfully with laser 
surgery 
other disorders of the retina are diabetic retinopathy a 
possible complication of diabetes and retinal detachment 
 
editors note t franklin williams a geriatrics physician is 
director of the national institute on aging one of the 13 
institutes that comprise the national institutes of health of the 
department of health and human services

the supreme court today agreed to decide how 
far states can go to shield victims of sexual assaults from unfair 
treatment without violating defendants fairtrial rights 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by michigan officials 
seeking to reinstate the conviction of nolan k lucas charged with 
forcing his former girlfriend to have sex with him 
at issue is whether evidence of the couples past sexual conduct 
may be barred from the trial because lucas failed to notify 
prosecutors 10 days before the trial began that he would seek to 
introduce such evidence 
lucas was convicted by a judge of criminal sexual conduct and 
sentenced to a prison term of 3 years 8 months to 15 years 
his former girlfriend said lucas forced her at knifepoint to 
have sex with him on aug 31 1984 two weeks after they broke up 
he said she consented to have sex with him and noted that she 
did not leave his home until late in the evening of the following 
day 
on the opening day of the trial a lawyer for lucas sought to 
admit evidence of the couples past sexual conduct 
the judge refused to allow the evidence on grounds lucas failed 
to comply with the states rape shield law requiring 10 days 
advance warning for the prosecutors 
the michigan court of appeals threw out the conviction ruling 
that lucass constitutional right to confront his accuser was 
violated 
the state court said the trial came down to who was telling the 
truth the defendant or his former girlfriend in such a case the 
state court said a defendant should not be barred automatically 
from introducing evidence of past sexual conduct 
the state court noted that the rape shield law permits the judge 
to question witnesses and review such evidence in private before 
deciding whether it should be aired in open court the judge has 
the opportunity to decide whether the evidence is relevant and 
whether it would unfairly prejudice a woman who accused someone of 
rape the appeals court said 
the appeals court also said the 10day notification requirement 
is designed to give prosecutors enough time to investigate a 
defendants claim 
for example it would allow them to question alibi witnesses in 
advance of a trial or determine the validity of an insanity claim 
by the defendant 
in the case of past sexual conduct between two people the state 
court said there are no other witnesses that have to be questioned 
and little reason to give prosecutors extra time to prepare 
michigan prosecutors said similar notification provisions have 
been upheld in other states 
the case is michigan vs lucas 90149

the five permanent members of the un security 
council have forged a draft peace accord aimed at settling 
cambodias civil war bolstering chances for an end to 12 years of 
fighting officials said monday 
the united states the soviet union china britain france and 
indonesia cochairmen with france of the paris conference on 
cambodia urged the warring factions to resolve their differences 
this was an important step forward in the process of a 
political settlement said assistant secretary of state richard 
solomon us representative to the talks 
in three days of talks ending late sunday the six nations 
agreed to a draft comprehensive political settlement to the 
cambodian conflict it paves the way for the reconvening of the 
paris conference on cambodia which recessed in failure in 
september 1989 
a senior us official suggested the paris conference could be 
reconvened in the next several months 
weve established the basis for moving forward and this is 
onehalf of it the official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity the cambodians are the other half of the process 
he said the paris conference could go forward to its 
conclusion only if there is a functioning supreme national 
council 
divisions between the government of prime minister hun sen and 
the threeparty resistance coalition center mainly on the 
composition of the supreme national council formed in september at 
talks in jakarta indonesia 
hun sen objects to coalition leader prince norodom sihanouks 
bid to head the body which would be titular head of the nation 
until free elections are called under the peace plan the united 
nations would administer cambodia during the period of transition 
taking over key ministries 
sihanouk has proposed making hun sen vicechairman of the 
national council but his main coalition partner the dreaded khmer 
rouge objects 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge and sihanouks refusal to 
disavow them have been the main stumbling block to a settlement of 
the conflict which started when vietnam invaded cambodia in 
december 1978 to topple them from a threeyear reign of terror 
sihanouk following a meeting sunday with solomon urged all 
four cambodian factions to meet as soon as possible in paris to 
resolve their differences there was no immediate word on whether 
such a meeting would occur 
the other members of the coalition are the noncommunist son 
sann and sihanouks party led by his son prince rannaridh 
the statement by the five permanent security council members 
said they would welcome the election of prince sihanouk to head the 
supreme national council but that cambodians themselves must work 
out a formula for its eventual composition 
hun sen also has objected to the vast un role planned for the 
country 
none of us doubts that there do remain significant 
difficulties the us official said but there is now a 
permanent momentum to the peace process underscored by the 
cooperation among the five permanent members of the un security 
council several of whom have a direct stake in cambodia 
phnom penhs friends are going along with the consensus the 
official said indicating that the hun sen government could be 
forced to back down on its objections or demands 
the draft settlement is based on the framework agreement of 
august 1990 endorsed by the security council and the un general 
assembly 
it contains a draft agreement covering major aspects of the 
settlement according to the statement by the five as well as five 
appendices dealing with the un role a ceasefire and withdrawal 
of foreign forces elections repatriation of cambodian refugees 
and principles for a new constitution 
the five also set out a draft agreement on the sovereignty 
independence and territorial integrity and neutrality of cambodia 
and a draft declaration on rehabilitation and reconstruction of the 
nation

troop numbers arent the only 
thing escalating in the desert the christmas crush of mail has 
arrived and postal workers are braced for a flood of holiday 
packages 
the christmas rush is here its been nonstop since 
thanksgiving said cpl calvin williams 23 of montgomery ala 
a member of the alabama national guard 1241st postal unit 
the raw numbers are staggering for the letters cards care 
packages bottles of water cookies elementary school projects 
banners and brooklyn bagels coming from the united states 
until now the army had been averaging 125 tons of mail sent 
from home each day about 25 times the volume from a month ago 
on sunday a singleday record of 211 tons was unloaded and in 
the next few weeks officials expect a peak of 400 tons of mail per 
day enough to fill three wide body commercial jets just for the 
army add in the mail for the air force navy and marines and that 
number will about double 
we never imagined these kinds of numbers we say we have 
christmas every day said lt col fred nichols of atlanta 
deputy commander of the organization that handles the armys mail 
how much mail is it well the us postal service in newark 
nj handles 800000 pounds of mail a month with 800 workers 
nichols said the army moves that much in a week with 300 soldiers 
now working 12hour shifts in a 24hour operation some even worked 
on thanksgiving 
at the post office here bundles of mail are stacked on a 
loading dock many have stickers featuring jolly santa claus 
figures or tags that said do not open until christmas convoys 
of 40foot trucks are backed up and some trucks make three trips 
daily to the troops 
mail is the link however tenuous that connects the troops with 
home it is especially important at christmas 
its really the only contact we have with our families from 
the generals on down to the lowest private mail is the lifeblood 
of the morale system nichols said 
its like a drink of water for somebody whos been out in the 
desert for 10 days said sp judith huffman of fort sam houston 
texas who works in the post office if the troops didnt have 
their mail theyd go bonkers 
the troops here have received nearly 10 million pounds of mail 
since being deployed in august as part of operating desert shield 
theyve sent home about 800000 pounds 
among the items going back are prayer rugs gold jewelry 
blankets trinkets video tapes cassette tapes and snapshots 
they are also sending home the most plentiful saudi souvenir 
there is sand sand is never more than a reach away and the 
granules are stuck into envelopes much to the chagrin of postal 
officials 
we would like to discourage that as much as possible it tends 
to leak out the envelopes and foul up the automated sorting 
equipment back in the states nichols said 
for more conventional gifts a canvas tent called cindys saudi 
store just behind the military post office offers rugs and 
knickknacks 
theres also a trailer for the army and air force exchange 
service a computerized shopping network that allows gis to pick 
gifts from a catalog and ship them to loved ones back home 
being away from family and being away from friends depression 
can set in said maj willie newson of the armys postal 
directorate christmas is an especially important time of year 
for mail

a homosexual couple sued the district of 
columbia monday contending the city had discriminated against them 
by refusing to approve their request for a marriage license 
we demand the right to marry and we demand the same legal 
rights and protections of our relationship that are freely given to 
people in heterosexual relationships said craig r dean a 
lawyer who filed the suit on behalf of himself and patrick g gill 
we are outraged by this blatant act of discrimination 
currently no state or locality in america allows samesex 
marriages said william rubenstein director of the gay and lesbian 
rights project of the american civil liberties union 
there were several lawsuits of this nature that were rejected 
back in the early 1970s rubenstein said in a telephone interview 
from his new york office 
frederick b beane clerk of the citys superior court denied 
the couples application for a marriage license last week on 
grounds that the sections of the district of columbia code 
governing marriage do not authorize marriage between persons of the 
same sex 
however dean and gill contend that city law explicitly 
prohibits only polygamists and practitioners of incest from 
obtaining marriage licenses and does not require a couple to be of 
different sexes to wed 
in addition homosexuals are protected from discrimination under 
the citys human rights act 
the clerk of the court saw fit to deny us the marriage license 
because we are gay dean said he saw fit to devalue and 
degrade our love and the very nature of our relationship 
the lawsuit asks superior court judge geoffrey m alprin to 
order beane to grant the couple the marriage license 
dean and gill are also seeking 250000 in compensatory damages 
and 1 million in punitive damages 
with punitive damages we want to be able to make a 
statement that the clerk will not deny marriage licenses to gay 
people again dean said 
however both men denied that their primary concern was setting 
a legal precedent 
we love each other gill said we are here in an attempt 
to formalize our relationship 
beane has 20 days to respond to the lawsuit 
neither beane nor claude bailey a spokesman for the citys 
corporation counsel was immediately available for comment

the supreme court agreed today to study the 
relationship of federal bankruptcy law and divorce settlements it 
will review a ruling one judge said makes bankruptcy law a tool 
by which bounders defraud their spouses 
the justices said they will decide in a wisconsin case whether 
divorced people awarded ownership of the family home may use 
federal bankruptcy law to avoid their exspouses corresponding 
award of a lien against the home 
the courts decision expected by july will affect many of 
the 12 million divorces granted every year in this country the 
justices were told 
when state divorce courts divide marital property they commonly 
award one of the spouses sole ownership of the family home and the 
other spouse property of equal value 
but if there are few assets to offset the worth of the family 
home divorce courts often order the spouse awarded the home to 
make cash payments to the exspouse to balance the scale a lien is 
imposed on the house to secure those payments 
that is what happened when gerald sanderfoot and jeanne farrey 
were divorced in 1986 after a 20year marriage 
sanderfoot was awarded ownership of the couples home in 
hortonville wis but was ordered to make cash payments to ms 
farrey 
three months after the divorce judgment sanderfoot filed for 
bankruptcy and sought to have the lien against his home nullified 
a bankruptcy judge refused but a federal trial judge agreed that 
the judicial lien against sanderfoots home could not be enforced 
once he filed for bankruptcy 
ms farrey appealed but the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
last march agreed that federal bankruptcy law treats such divorce 
judgment liens as it does other judicial liens it allows them to 
be avoided 
other federal appeals courts have reached conflicting rulings 
stating that such divorce judgment liens cannot be avoided 
dissenting from the 21 ruling in march judge richard posner 
called the result a perversion of bankruptcy law 
the bankruptcy code as liberalized in 1978 is widely 
criticized as making bankruptcy an ordinary tool of business 
planning but after today it will also be criticized as a tool by 
which bounders defraud their spouses posner said when a 
debtor uses the code to steal from his former wife we should not 
lightly conclude that the code properly read commands such a 
result 
the case is farrey vs sanderfoot 90350

the supreme court today let stand new york 
citys ban on poor and homeless people begging for money in the 
citys subways 
the justices without comment rejected arguments that the 
citys ban on begging and panhandling throughout the subway 
system violates freespeech rights 
todays action carries no direct impact for other cities with 
similar policies the action merely a denial of review sets no 
national legal precedent 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide how far states can go to shield victims of 
sexual assaults from unfair treatment without violating defendants 
fairtrial rights 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by michigan officials 
seeking to reinstate the conviction of nolan k lucas charged with 
forcing his former girlfriend to have sex with him 
at issue is whether evidence of the couples past sexual conduct 
may be barred from the trial because lucas failed to notify 
prosecutors 10 days before the trial began that he would seek to 
introduce such evidence 
agreed to study the relationship of federal bankruptcy law and 
divorce settlements it voted to review a ruling one judge said 
makes bankruptcy law a tool by which bounders defraud their 
spouses 
the justices said they will decide in a wisconsin case whether 
divorced people awarded ownership of the family home may use 
federal bankruptcy law to avoid their exspouses corresponding 
award of a lien against the home 
agreed to decide whether state judges may be forced to retire 
at age 70 
the court said it will hear arguments by two missouri judges 
that their states mandatory retirement age violates federal law 
and unconstitutionally treats them differently than other missouri 
employees 
refused to kill an affirmative action program in florida aimed 
at awarding more public works contracts to businesses run by 
minorities and women 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by companies that 
said the tampaarea program is unconstitutional because it condones 
reverse discrimination against white men 
refused to kill two fairhousing lawsuits that stem from 
newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models 
posing as homeowners 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that forces 
developers of a virginia condominium community to defend themselves 
in a jury trial against allegations they violated federal laws 
let stand a ruling that state officials may be sued for 
shutting down a daycare center without giving the owner a chance 
to respond to charges of child abuse and overcrowding 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by arizona 
officials seeking immunity from a lawsuit by a tucson daycare 
center 
turned down a bid by the nations nuclear power industry to 
scuttle anticipated federal rules for the training of nuclear plant 
workers 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand a federal 
appeals court ruling that forces the nuclear regulatory commission 
to issue such binding rules 
agreed to review one aspect of a long legal battle in which 
animal rights groups are seeking to save four monkeys used for 
medical research 
the justices said they will decide whether a federal agency may 
transfer the groups lawsuit from state to federal court 
let stand a ruling that a state may limit how much money a 
candidate may receive from political committees 
the court without comment rejected arguments that such a 
wisconsin campaignfinancing law violates freespeech rights 
the high court in 1980 ruled that the freespeech protections of 
the constitutions first amendment extend to people who go 
doortodoor soliciting money for charities 
but the justices never have ruled that soliciting for ones own 
needs is constitutionally protected 
that is just what a federal judge in new york ruled last 
january us district judge leonard sand struck down the ban 
imposed by the citys transit authority while often disturbing 
and sometimes alarmingly graphic begging is unmistakably 
informative and persuasive speech he ruled 
sand said the transit authority could limit where and when 
begging is allowed and regulate beggars conduct but could not 
impose a flat ban 
referring to the supreme courts 1980 ruling sand said a 
meaningful distinction cannot be drawn for first amendment purposes 
between solicitations for charity and begging 
the citys subway system does not ban solicitation for 
charitable religious or political causes 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals reversed sands ruling by 
a 21 vote in may and reinstated the ban on begging 
even if begging and panhandling constitute protected 
expressive conduct which is in serious doubt we hold that the 
regulation at issue is not in violation of the first 
amendment the appeals court wrote 
the appeals court said sands ruling reflects an exacerbated 
deference to the alleged individual rights of beggars and 
panhandlers to the great detriment of the common good 
the appeals court pointed to evidence that subway passengers 
find begging unlike soliciting by organized charities to be 
intimidating and threatening the difference must be examined not 
from the imaginary heights of mount olympus but from the very real 
context of the new york city subway it said 
in the appeal acted on today advocates for poor and homeless 
people urged the justices to rule that begging is speech and 
should be accorded some legal protections 
an individual who represents a charity that the transit 
authority has approved for solicitation may place a cup at her 
feet on subway facilities and hold a sign that says help the 
homeless but if the individual acts on her own and the sign says 
help me im homeless she will be subject to arrest the appeal 
said 
if this court does not act promptly to protect first amendment 
rights the court of appeals refused to recognize the poorest 
members of our society will be subject to further assaults on their 
dignity as human beings the justices were told 
lawyers for the citys subway system urged the court to reject 
the appeal contending that the ban is a reasonable regulation 
governing the time place and manner of individual solicitations 
new yorks subway system encompassing 468 stations and 648 
miles of track serves about 35 million passengers each workday 
it operates seven days a week 24 hours a day 
the case is young vs new york city transit authority 90591

president bush began a twoday visit 
to mexico to advance the two nations goal of enacting an open 
trading policy across their border 
bushs itinerary today called for consultations with president 
carlos salinas de gortari on trade and other usmexico issues 
the trip marks a shift of hemispheric focus three days after bushs 
return from a thanksgiving trip to the middle east 
salinas was welcoming bush to his hometown of agualeguas and 
taking him to a rodeo before hosting him for lunch and talks at 
salinas family residence 
tuesdays schedule calls for the two to meet in monterrey 55 
miles from agualeguas and the prosperous industrial capital of 
mexico where bush will address mexican business leaders 
the principle focus of the sixth meeting between bush and 
salinas is the drive for a free trade agreement similar to one the 
united states completed with canada in 1988 
mexico and the united states are committed to achieving a free 
trade pact both countries stand to reap financial benefits 
although some sectors of the mexican economy are resisting the idea 
of competing with their industrial giant neighbors 
hesitation also comes from some us sectors labor groups raise 
concerns that us jobs will go across the border because of the 
drastically lower wage scale there a us government study shows 
the average hourly wage at foreignoperated assembly plants on the 
mexican side of the border is 163 compared with 1432 in the 
united states 
the two countries have begun informal talks and the bush 
administration has asked congress to provide the necessary approval 
early next year so formal negotiations can begin 
administration officials say a pact could be settled by early 
1992 
we have made a commitment to a free trade agreement with 
mexico we want to do it as soon as possible bush told the 
mexican government news agency notimex in an interview last week 
mexico wants any free trade agreement to make it easer for 
mexicans to enter the united states and the two presidents may 
take up the sensitive issue of treatment of mexicans who cross into 
the united states to find work 
us officials said officials also are considering bringing 
canada into the talks for a trilateral free trade pact 
bush who will visit five south american countries on a separate 
trip next week is counting on mexico and other latin nations to 
keep hemispheric solidarity in the face of the deteriorating trade 
talks with european nations that go into final negotiations next 
week 
the socalled general agreement on tariffs and trade talks are 
in danger of collapsing because of european nations refusal to 
relinquish their farm subsidies 
with the persian gulf crisis dominating the world scene mexico 
has joined the us bandwagon against iraq by increasing its oil 
exports to make up for the loss of oil from iraq and kuwait mexico 
has boosted its production by 100000 barrels a day for export to 
the united states 
that was a very welcome and constructive contribution not 
just to the united states but to all the countries in the world 
who are affected by the current runup in oil prices bernard 
aronson assistant secretary of state for latin american affairs 
said last week 
any discussion on the issue of drugs was not expected to be in 
depth 
mexican officials say their cooperation on the drug problem is 
at least as good as it ever has been but us officials have 
stated concerns about increased shipments of colombian cocaine 
through mexico mexico is the largest foreign source of marijuana 
sold in the united states and one of the largest sources of heroin 
a new state department report said there has been a significant 
increase in drug enforcement activities by mexican authorities over 
the past two years although corruption continues to be a problem

the bush administration is ready to ask the 
united nations security council to approve military force to 
liberate kuwait unless iraq withdraws its troops by jan 1 us 
officials say 
the proposed resolution was circulated as the council prepared 
for todays start of a weeklong debate on the persian gulf crisis 
if adopted it would mark the strongest step taken by the council 
since iraqi president saddam hussein invaded his oilrich neighbor 
aug 2 
the jan 1 deadline is not locked in concrete a us 
official told the associated press sunday night this leaves room 
for more maneuvering as the bush administration tries to maintain 
an international alliance against the invasion amid soviet 
reservations about using military force without trying further 
diplomacy 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity noted that 
secretary of state james a baker iii had demanded the iraqi 
invaders leave kuwait by the end of the year weve just kind of 
formalized it in the proposed resolution he said 
the resolution was circulated among the other permanent members 
of the security council great britain france china and the 
soviet union all of which have the power to block it 
officials of all five delegations held a strategy session today 
hosted by the chinese delegation diplomatic sources said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today he was 
hopeful the un would approve the resolution on military force 
were very optimistic he said 
speaking to reporters accompanying president bush on a flight to 
mexico fitzwater indicated the administration wants a deadline for 
saddams pullout from kuwait we think theres some value to have 
a date certain but we dont want a specific date because its 
still subject to negotiation he added 
fitzwater declined to say however whether any deadline was 
included in the draft un resolution 
we want saddam hussein to know what were talking about how 
long he has to act the spokesman said and to take some of the 
uncertainty out of the situation fitzwater also said if the 
resolution is passed we hope hell pull out immediately 
the proposed us resolution would refer to force indirectly by 
saying that if iraq did not pull its forces out of kuwait all 
necessary means would be used to get them out a us official 
said 
bush leaving the white house this morning for the twoday visit 
to mexico gave a jaunty thumbs up when asked if he had the votes 
in the un to win support of the resolution 
us officials have said they did not expect the soviet union 
and china to block a resolution on force but raised the 
possibility they would seek softer language than the united states 
prefers britain and france were expected to back a resolution 
authorizing force 
the soviets and others who counseled more diplomacy have urged 
the bush administration to be patient for at least two more months 
another administration official who also asked not to be 
identified by name said the draft amounts to a compromise that 
baker expects to be adopted by thursday one not authorizing 
immediate action but allowing action sooner than the two months 
suggested by the soviets 
the united states yields its presidency of the security council 
on friday yemen which objects to threatening iraq with force 
takes over the leadership the following day 
the president of yemen said in an interview published in todays 
editions of the washington post that united nations backing for 
force would be a very dangerous development that would threaten 
the entire region 
it is still possible to find a peaceful solution for the 
complete withdrawal of all iraqi troops from kuwait and all foreign 
forces from the region ali abdallah salih said in the interview 
conducted in sanaa yemen 
baker will lead the us delegation in the security council 
which is hearing first from kuwaits ousted rulers presenting their 
case against saddam 
most if not all of the 15 nations on the security council will 
be represented in the debate by their foreign ministers this will 
give baker the chance to coordinate closely with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the two have cooperated on the resolutions adopted by the 
council since the invasion including a worldwide ban on trade with 
iraq 
the bush administration is determined to keep the soviets on 
board in order to maintain the makeshift alliance against iraq that 
also includes major arab and european countries 
brent scowcroft president bushs national security adviser 
said earlier sunday in washington there was a common feeling 
among members of the usled coalition against iraq and the un 
general assembly that the persian gulf crisis must be brought to an 
end 
although the united states has labored to put together a strong 
alliance against saddam united nations approval is not necessary 
to legitimize any american action against baghdad scowcroft said 
on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
bush made a similar pronouncement friday saying we have the 
authority to do what we have to do against saddam regardless of 
a un vote 
defense secretary dick cheney appearing on cbstvs face the 
nation program said one hazard was that the coalition against 
iraq could fall apart before unimposed economic sanctions 
succeed in forcing saddam out of kuwait 
many countries particularly arab nations such as jordan turkey 
and egypt are paying a high economic price for cutting off all 
ties with iraq cheney said

president carlos salinas de gortari in 
an interview in advance of president bushs arrival for two days of 
economic talks accused the united states of engaging in trade 
protectionism 
today american products can enter the mexican market without 
restriction but ours are detained at customs and there are always 
many restrictions salinas said in the monterrey daily el norte 
monday 
salinas and president george bush were scheduled to hold two 
days of talks monday and tuesday focusing on a free trade 
agreement 
salinas said the united states has adopted protectionist 
attitudes in agricultural and fishing product trade especially 
with a recession looming in the background 
mexican fruits and vegetables are periodically barred from the 
united states on the grounds that they dont meet quality 
standards those bans are seen in mexico as the manipulation of 
regulations engineered by small us lobbies 
a recent ban on mexican tuna which environmentalists said was 
caught in nets that kill dolphins caused a huge outcry here the 
ban was recently reversed by a us federal district court 
what you have to ask is what are they defending their 
nations interest or the particular interest of these protectionist 
groups salinas said 
he said his talks with bush would cover free trade but not 
migrant workers or democratic reforms in mexico he said charges of 
fraud in recent elections in the states of coahuila hidalgo and 
mexico will not affect the talks 
we are going to negotiate exclusively aspects of trade goods 
and services this will be the main thrust of negotiations 
mexicos internal political affairs will be settled internally by 
mexicans he said 
salinas said economic reforms must take precedence over 
political reforms and claimed opposition parties have not been able 
to present a consistent alternative 
the institutional revolutionary party known as the pri has 
ruled mexico since its foundation in 1929 critics have accused the 
party of ensuring its hold on power by suppressing the opposition 
and election fraud 
the united states has not pushed mexico for democratic reforms 
as it has smaller countries in the region such as nicaragua 
the bush administration has said it hopes to have the free trade 
pact by 1992 
i believe that during this meeting we will ratify our 
political commitment to move ahead with negotiations and to design 
a way to promote in our respective countries the positive climate 
necessary to conclude these negotiations salinas said

a michigan republican said monday he will 
challenge rep jerry lewis for the partys no 3 house leadership 
position deepening the fissures that divide the chambers minority 
party 
rep carl d pursell a seventerm lawmaker from ann arbor said 
he made the decision to seek a leadership post after receiving 
support from colleagues 
many of us believe my past leadership is a good example of how 
the republican conference should and can craft better policies 
than the democrats pursell said in a statement 
the conference is the organization of all house republicans a 
group that will total 167 in the 435member house that convenes in 
january after suffering a net nineseat loss in this months 
elections the party finds itself at its lowest ebb in the house 
since 1982 
pursells challenge to lewis rcalif will be the second 
contested leadership race when party members meet in a week to 
select their leaders for the coming two years 
rep don sundquist rtenn already has said he will seek the 
job of chairman of the national republican congressional committee 
which raises money and aids gop house candidates that job has been 
held for 14 years by rep guy vander jagt rmich 
many see the two races as signs of a division in the party over 
ideology and tactics one which became apparent two years ago when 
rep newt gingrich rga narrowly won the partys no 2 
leadership post republican whip 
the recent battle over the federal budget was one indicator of 
splits within the party lewis supported a budget deal backed by 
president bush while pursell joined gingrich in attacking the 
plan 
in the nrcc race gingrich is supporting vander jagts bid to

a senior citizens group put its payroll money 
into a neighborhood bank dedicated to serving the same people it 
was trying to help 
it was an opportunity to show a united front and maintain the 
stability of the community said grace harwood executive 
director of the fort greene senior citizens council 
but it and a number of other charitable organizations got a rude 
awakening this month when freedom national once one of the 
nations largest minorityowned banks went under 
groups that had more than 100000 the limit for federal 
deposit insurance were told they were out of luck even if the 
money was divided among several smaller accounts 
the united negro college fund had 414000 in a certificate of 
deposit money that was being held in trust for member schools 
well have to take funds from other sources said executive 
vice president bill allen we might have to do a special 
fundraiser 
bhrags inc which provides 700 home attendants for senior 
citizens in brooklyn had 612000 in freedom when the bank was 
closed nov 12 
the central brooklyn coordinating council operating 10 
socialservice programs that reach nearly 5000 people put its 
losses at 700000 said executive director charles joshua 
we think that millions of dollars are at risk here said 
ed barbini a spokesman for state attorney general robert abrams 
its a major setback for social services in the city 
the federal deposit insurance corp considers multiple accounts 
belonging to a single depositor as a single account said spokesman 
david barr the only exception would be if one person or group was 
holding money in trust for others he said 
abrams argued that many of the community groups fit that 
description prompting the fdic to reconsider its decision to 
reimburse the groups only 100000 
we have to go back and look at that ownership trail barr 
said 
abrams representatives and fdic officials met wednesday and 
plan to meet again this week 
in the meantime some agencies have gotten advances from city 
agencies including the fort greene group which was in danger of 
missing its payroll right before thanksgiving 
the senior citizens council which runs five brooklyn centers 
and also provides day care services had 316506 in freedom in 24 
accounts harwood said since none was over the 100000 fdic 
limit they thought they were safe 
that money is operations money its not money that sits 
there harwood said if this money is not replaced we will 
have to curtail the programs 
the central brooklyn council also got temporary funding from the 
city but joshua stressed it would have to be paid back 
barr noted that freedoms situation was not unique 
when you close 600 banks over a threeyear period youre 
bound to run into everything he said 
the largest bailout of an insolvent bank was the 45 billion 
government takeover of chicagos continental illinois in 1984 
in that case the fdic did insure all deposits because its 
failure would have had such a severe impact on the financial system 
that it would have cost the government more to close it than to 
save it 
but some of freedoms depositors see that as unfair 
if that was done for continental why not for freedom allen 
said 
unless the attorney general works out a deal for the charities 
allen said the united negro college fund will be standing in line 
with the banks other creditors when the fdic auctions off its 
remaining assets 
barr said the organizations still owed money including the 
fdic itself can expect to get something depending on how much 
the auction raises 
chances are they will not receive 100 cents on the dollar 
he said

arizona sen dennis deconcini wrote an aide in 
1986 asking what we can do to bring heat on a federal banking 
regulator who was opposed by savings and loan owner charles h 
keating jr the senate ethics committee was told today 
the senators memo to his staff aide laurie a sedlmayr was 
written in december 1986 after keating had made clear his 
opposition to top bank regulator edwin gray who wanted keatings 
thrift to adhere to investment limits 
committee special counsel robert s bennett cited the memo in 
questioning sedlmayr as the panel held its fifth day of hearings 
into allegations deconcini and four other senators improperly 
intervened with regulators on behalf of keating a financial 
contributor 
sedlmayr said she was aware keating wanted gray out of office 
deconcini wrote her a memo on dec 11 1986 citing press accounts 
of potential financial and ethical problems facing gray and asking 
anything we can do to bring heat 
she said she responded five days later saying it was probably 
unnecessary for him to take action and suggesting the senator 
stay out of this sedlmayr under questioning by bennett said 
keating was more aggressive than many other businessmen she dealt 
with 
i found him to be something of a zealot and i wasnt 
comfortable with that she said 
i think the senator probably thought i was overstating the 
case she said 
keating who owned the now defunct lincoln savings and loan and 
his associates contributed 13 million to the senators campaigns 
or favored causes 
as the panel began its fifth day of hearings in three weeks 
deconcini dariz was the only one of the five senators under 
investigation who attended the session the other four are 
republican john mccain of arizona and democrats alan cranston of 
california donald riegle of michigan and john glenn of ohio 
sedlmayr was questioned about a memo she wrote to deconcini in 
1987 suggesting a possible deal with the government on behalf of 
keatings savings and loan deconcini denies he offered a deal or 
tried to negotiate for keating in the april 2 1987 meeting 
sedlmayr testified that deconcini went to the april 2 meeting 
with three other senators and gray despite being warned by an aide 
that the session was a political mistake 
she testified that she was not concerned about the propriety of 
the meeting but was concerned gray would misrepresent it 
later 
i told him i didnt think it was a good idea and could later 
be misinterpreted by the press she said i thought it was 
a political mistake 
sedlmayr and other aides were not included in the meeting but 
she said that when it ended deconcini said he was pretty 
disgusted she said deconcini recounted that gray had said i 
dont know anything about lincoln i dont have any information and 
youll have to meet with the regulators in san francisco 
riegle chairman of the senate banking committee did not attend 
that meeting however he did attend a session on lincoln a week 
later with the other senators and san franciscobased federal 
regulators 
the question of whether deconcini offered a deal on keatings 
behalf is considered crucial to the ethics investigation 
bennett told the panel there is overwhelming evidence 
deconcini asked gray to withdraw a regulation opposed by keating in 
exchange for a promise by lincoln to make more home loans 
the regulation limited lincolns ability to make risky 
investments in speculative real estate ventures 
sedlmayrs memo to her boss detailed what american continental 
wants from gray for concessions and what american continental 
is willing to do american continental was lincolns 
phoenixbased parent company controlled by keating 
a sworn statement by another senate aide says that deconcini 
took the sedlmayr memo with him to the april 2 meeting and made 
verbal references to the subjects discussed in the memorandum 
that statement was by mary jane veno administrative assistant 
to glenn she said she was told of the memos use by gene karp 
deconcinis administrative assistant when the meeting was over 
she said mccain asked deconcini to explain what he had been 
talking about and in response deconcini gave mccain a copy of the 
memo 
but karp said friday he did not know if deconcini actually 
referred to the memo and could not recall what he told veno 
as i remember it now gray said at the very beginning he 
didnt know anything about lincoln and deconcini never got into the 
subject matter of the investigation or anything about that karp 
said in an interview with the associated press whether there was 
any specific reference made i cant answer only the principals 
that were there can answer it 
gray has said deconcini offered a quid pro quo proposal and 
that gray believed the meeting was improper 
no aides attended the april 2 meeting and bennett said there is 
evidence deconcinis office instructed all to come alone 
lincoln was the object of a bank board examination at the time 
of the meeting bennett said the senators were there with varying 
degrees of intensity to pressure the board to end promptly the 
lincoln examination 
lincoln was seized by the federal government in april 1989 at a 
potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than 2 billion to 
cover insured deposits

thousands of rail workers in eastern germany 
walked off the job monday demanding protection from layoffs caused 
by unification and the strike disrupted travel in neighboring 
countries 
the strike was the first major walkout since the germanys united 
on oct 3 it started in berlin sunday evening then spread across 
eastern germany monday forcing some transeuropean express trains 
to stop in czechoslovakia 
about 260000 employees of the former east german reichsbahn 
rail authority facing heavy layoffs in a merger with the former 
west german bundesbahn voted overwhelmingly to strike after 
negotiations broke down on thursday 
no new talks were scheduled 
the east german reichsbahn estimated that the strike caused 
150000 people to postpone trips or find other ways to travel the 
rail line carried an average of 16 million passengers a day in 
1989 
the planned layoffs of 68000 workers affect not only people in 
former communist east germany but also west berliners said peter 
lind a local strike leader advising travelers aboutbus 
connections at the berlinzoo station the main railhead in western 
berlin 
we agree that there are too many workers now but we say there 
should be a longer time to reduce the number as people retire 
lind said 
in another job dispute union officials said more than 10000 
workers employed by the united states and other military services 
in germany staged one and twohour warning strikes monday 
members of the public workers and transport union fear they may 
lose 23000 of the 100000 civilian jobs at nato bases because of 
troop reductions resulting from the eastwest accords that 
permitted unification 
the warning strikes have had no impact at ramstein air base 
which is being used to send troops and supplies to the usled 
multinational force arrayed against iraq in the gulf said doug 
moore a spokesman for the us air force 
nato base employees like the rail workers want retraining or 
protection against layoffs 
the rail strike hit freight as well as passenger services but 
the german news agency adn said shipments of relief supplies to 
poland and the soviet union were permitted to continue 
in prague the czechoslovak news agency ctk said germanybound 
express trains from hungary and romania were denied entry into 
germany and were waiting on czechoslovak territory 
the national rail authority would have to limit international 
trains bound for germany that already are on the hungarian border 
ctk said 
pay levels in the former communist part of germany are about 
onethird of pay scales in the west most industries plan to raise 
eastern salaries gradually over several years to levels in the 
west 
germanys eastern and western rail companies are to be unified 
by 1992 but eastern rail workers joined the western union of 
german rail workers months ago 
the union says eastern workers earn 675 to 945 a month an 
average of 675 less than their western counterparts 
the union wants eastern salaries to reach 60 percent of western 
scales in january but its primary demand is no mass layoffs 
most eastern german industries now being administered by a 
national trust organization face heavy layoffs and restructuring 
to become competitive with the west

a blaze feeding off more than 16 million gallons 
of jet fuel burned unchecked at stapleton international airport 
today but appeared to diminish in intensity as two of three 
ruptured tanks burned themselves out 
fears that a fourth tank which had sprung a leak and was 
buckling might rupture eased by late morning 
things are going real real good the intensity has dropped 
dramatically said fire department spokesman nick nuanes adding 
that firefighters were moving closer to the tanks as the intensity 
tapered off 
flight delays caused by a fuel shortage wrenched thousands of 
travelers hurring home from their thanksgiving visits sunday but 
replacement fuel was being trucked in today to make up for the fuel 
lost in the blaze 
the blaze erupted sunday morning and engulfed two tanks 
containing 400000 gallons of fuel each it exploded from huge to 
gigantic later that night when an 800000gallon tank became 
overheated ruptured and ignited 
the two smaller tanks largely burned themselves out today but 
the 800000gallon tank continued to burn fire officials said the 
tank contained enough fuel to burn until about midday wednesday 
a fourth tank containing 350000 gallons of fuel was leaking 
fuel from the bottom and the fuel was erupting into flames but the 
tank was not expected to rupture as authorities had feared earlier 
in all the tank farm contains 12 tanks 
firefighters initially said sunday that another 800000gallon 
tank also had ignited but it turned out that that fire was at a 
holding pond where fuel had gathered behind the burning 
400000gallon tanks firefighters kept fire hoses trained on that 
800000gallon tank hoping to keep it cooled so it would not 
ignite 
the sunday after thanksgiving traditionally is stapletons 
busiest day of the year the tanks had been filled saturday night 
in anticipation of heavy holiday air traffic officials said 
the fire caused flight delays because of refueling 
difficulties and traffic jams stapleton is the nations 
fourthbusiest airport in terms of passenger volume 
you know im really hassled said actress goldie hawn 
whose sunday afternoon flight to los angeles was canceled she and 
actor kurt russell had been skiing in aspen 
the fire continued to burn fiercely and unchecked this morning 
firefighters monitored the blazes progress and kept fire hoses 
trained on the second 800000gallon tank but did not plan an 
offensive to extinguish the fire 
the blaze which cast a haze over denver this morning and 
occasionally caused visibility problems on nearby interstate 70 
could burn for days 
this was bad and its gotten worse and we just have to stay 
with it until it does what its going to do denver aviation 
director george doughty said right now i think its a serious 
problem but i dont think it is endangering anything other than 
the fuel farm 
the fire burned well north of the stapleton terminal where air 
traffic continued there are no homes or businesses anywhere near 
the site 
there are 12 tanks holding about 125 million gallons of fuel in 
the storage area the tanks are designed to rupture not explode 
when they get overheated 
the fire caused long flight delays sunday for united airlines 
which depended almost exclusively on the tank farm for its jet 
fuel 
this is a big problem said united spokeswoman laura 
winiarski and it was a bad day to happen this is one of our 
busiest travel days of the year 
she said all of uniteds 186 flights into and out of denver were 
delayed by the fire with some of the delays four hours or longer 
she said 24000 passengers in denver were affected and thousands 
of others also were delayed as flights into and out of denver a 
major united hub backed up 
but today united said its aircraft were being fueled by tanker 
trucks from conoco predicting that the airline would return to a 
normal flight schedule spokesman joe hopkins said flights arriving 
at stapleton were carrying extra fuel further reducing the problem 
of refueling 
firemen worked 30minute shifts before having to take breaks 
from the work near flames reaching 3500 degrees fahrenheit 
its real debilitating said firefighter jim hawkins its 
like being in a sauna for too long you feel like you have 
spaghetti for legs 
five firefighters were treated at denver general hospital for 
dehydration and heat exhaustion and two others were treated for 
smoke inhalation at the scene but the fire caused no serious 
injuries 
stapleton spokesman richard boulware said jet fuel costs about 
140 a gallon meaning the fuel being consumed by fire is worth 
about 22 million

a miami federal judge expressed concern today about 
a growing perception that general manuel noriega wont be able to 
get a fair trial 
us district judge william hoeveler who will preside over the 
trial said he would rule by thursday on whether taping of noriega 
phone conversations may have prejudiced the case against the former 
panamanian dictator 
he also told government attorneys he wanted proof that frozen 
noriega funds are drugtainted and said he would set another 
hearing on the funds issue by next week 
i am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to 
be acquiring that the defendant is not going to be able to get a 
fair trial said hoeveler 
the judge said today that his ruling on the tapes issue could 
extend to more than just whether the tapes violate attorneyclient 
privilege but could deal with whether the tapes threaten the 
broader drug case against noriega 
the tapes were obtained by cnn which last week turned them over 
to hoeveler that was after noriegas defense attorneys moved to 
block cnn from airing the tapes saying they would prejudice the 
case against their client 
some of the tapes are of noriega talking to his attorney or 
legal representatives 
hoeveler transferred the tapes to a federal magistrate in miami 
and transcripts of them are expected to be ready this afternoon 
hoeveler has called a lawyers conference for wednesday and 
says he will issue his ruling right after the meeting or sometime 
thursday 
on the question of noriegas funds hoeveler said he planned to 
a schedule a hearing within 10 days noriegas attorneys say they 
will have to withdraw if they cant get paid because funds are 
frozen 
hoeveler who would have to appoint new attorneys asked the 
government to make another effort to get some noriega funds freed 
to pay for his defense he earlier had said noriega must have had 
some legitimate income in military salary but prosecutors have 
said panama and other foreign governments have their own forfeiture 
actions tying up noriegas money 
prosecutors have indicated they dont want to help the defense 
by showing pretrial proof of noriegas drug links 
the government wont get to try this case by trial by 
ambush lead defense attorney frank rubino said after todays 
hearing

two strategists of last years prodemocracy 
movement have been charged with plotting to overthrow the 
government a crime punishable by death chinese sources said 
monday 
the accused men are chen zeming 37 who was publisher of the 
nowbanned economic studies weekly and wang juntao 32 who was 
its editor they were also charged with counterrevolutionary 
incitement 
the charges which come more than a year after the two were 
arrested are the most serious brought so far against any 
intellectuals involved in the june 1989 protests which were 
crushed by the military 
their families received official notices late last week of the 
charges said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity no trial 
dates were set 
in charging the two the government moved closer to confronting 
the sensitive issue of what role highlevel support and 
behindthescenes maneuvering played in the protests 
neither wang nor chen was publicly prominent during the seven 
weeks of studentled marches for democratic reform that began in 
beijing and spread nationwide 
but after the movement was crushed the official media accused 
chen and wang of being black hands who manipulated the students 
in an effort to topple the government 
hong kong news reports said the two men both participants in 
earlier democracy movements met frequently with student leaders 
and helped plan strategy including the timing of marches and 
wording of demands 
wang had ties to high communist party officials dating from the 
early 1980s when he was an alternate member of the communist youth 
leagues central committee 
official chinese news reports last year accused bao tong 
secretary to thencommunist party general secretary zhao ziyang of 
involvement in plotting the protests by formally charging wang and 
chen the government has committed itself to reveal more details of 
what happened behind the scenes potentially implicating zhaos 
aide 
zhao himself was ousted for allegedly supporting the movement 
but the party has closed its investigation of him without 
announcing any conclusion because of the danger of splitting party 
ranks 
after announcing thousands of arrests immediately after crushing 
the protests authorities stopped releasing information word of 
charges being filed and sentences being handed down has come only 
from relatives and friends of those accused 
the beijing city foreign affairs office said it had not heard 
about wang and chen being charged their trials are likely to be 
closed 
at least 18 workers and peasants have been executed on charges 
of murder theft and destroying state property during riots that 
followed the army crackdown on the protesters 
unofficial reports have emerged of other protesters receiving 
prison sentences of up to 15 years hundreds of lesser participants 
have been sent to camps for threeyear terms of education through 
labor a sentence that can be handed down by police without 
trial 
the government also has acknowledged that 355 prisoners are 
still awaiting charges in beijing alone 
neither family has been allowed to visit wang or chen since they 
were arrested in canton in october 1989 apparently while trying to 
flee the country they are believed held in beijings qincheng 
prison where other political offenders are jailed 
both men were active in earlier movements for democratic reform 
wang helped found and edit an unofficial journal called beijing 
spring during a brief period of oen political debate in 197879 
known as the democracy wall movement 
he and chen were arrested in 1976 for taking part in mass 
protests in tiananmen square against the radical leftist leaders of 
the cultural revolution 
they were released and praised as heroes when the cultural 
revolution leadership was ousted and the protest was officially 
reappraised as having been patriotic

bridge sank into the lake sunday after a weekend of high winds and 
record rains the bridge adjacent to the yearold i90 floating 
bridge was being renovated for eventual use as i90s eastbound 
lanes 
officials said the new bridge would probably be closed for 
weeks as the main link between seattle and its suburbs east of the 
lake the bridge normally handles 110000 cars a day 
freezing temperatures overnight caused icy roads which resulted 
in numerous fenderbenders crawford said no serious injuries were 
reported

oversight by construction crews 
henkel inspected what was left of the bridge sunday he said 
sections of the bridge deck and hatches in the concrete pontoons 
were left open 
that allowed to rising lake water to pour through the side 
hatches and started a domino effect which finished up with losing 
portions of the bridge henkel said 
other officials said high winds and heavy rain contributed to 
the collapse although the exact cause was under investigation

in the largest japanese purchase of a us company 
matsushita electric industrial co announced today that it is 
buying mca corp owner of universal studios in a deal worth 66 
billion 
matsushita a 378 billion giant known for such brand names as 
panasonic quasar and technics is japans biggest manufacturer of 
consumer electronics equipment 
by buying the maker of such box office hits as jaws and 
back to the future matsushita seemed to be trying to keep pace 
with archrival sony corp which bought columbia pictures for 5 
billion a year ago analysts said 
universal is the fourth hollywood studio to come under foreign 
control the deal seems likely to heighten fears in the united 
states that too many major us companies are falling under 
japanese control 
asked how the purchase would affect usjapan relations 
matsushitas president akio tanii said jokingly that he hoped 
mca will make a movie called japanbashing 
under the agreement matsushita is to start a cash tender offer 
of 66 a share for mcas about 928 million shares of common stock 
by nov 30 
mca shareholders will also get stock in a television station 
that cannot be sold to matsushita because federal rules prohibit 
foreignbased companies from owning us broadcast stations 
the deal calls for mca shareholders to get one share in a new 
company that will own mcas new yorkarea television station wwor 
for every five shares of mca stock they own just before the tender 
offer is completed 
company officials have estimated the new shares will be worth 
about 5 for every share of mca stock adding that to the 66 per 
share in cash brings the pershare value to 71 or nearly 66 
billion for mcas fully diluted shares 
in trading on the new york stock exchange mca was the most 
actively traded issue slipping 25 cents a share by late morning to 
6512 
mca corps chairman and chief executive officer 77yearold 
lew wasserman stands to earn about about 355 million from the 
deal wasserman had personal holdings of 5 million mca shares or 7 
percent and controlled an additional 6 million through trusts and 
charities 
matsushita is a great international company wasserman said 
this combination assures the structural integrity of mca and its 
worldwide operation mca will continue to operate under its own 
name and will be run by its existing management 
the purchase which followed two months of intense sometimes 
frustrating negotiations is seen as matsushitas attempt to 
dominate the growing merger of technological hardware and 
entertainment industries 
software and hardware have been developing simultaneously 
they are like wheels of the same car tanii said at company 
headquarters in osaka we intend that excellent works made by mca 
will be distributed all over the world through a variety of 
media 
analysts say matsushita will now have a ready stock of 
highprofile movie and television programming to use for its high 
definition television considered the next generation in home 
entertainment 
nonetheless several analysts said the muchtouted natural 
linkup between hardware manufacturers and movie video and tv 
entertainment companies is still an unproven strategy for one 
thing digitalizing older movies and tv programs for high 
definition tv is very expensive 
it looks like theyre doing it and trying to figure out 
strategy afterward said mike jeremy an analyst in tokyo for 
baring securities 
in japan matsushita is jokingly called maneshita or 
copycat for its custom of introducing products only after its 
competitors have tested the market for them 
but some people envision a future of integrated home 
entertainment consoles that would include high definition tv a 
personal computer stereo and other gadgetry and that future may 
accrue to the company with the most prominent image analysts said 
sony has a strong image people in most countries would 
automatically know what a walkman is jeremy said matsushita 
has panasonic quasar and technics but they need to rationalize 
themselves into one image 
but in an atmosphere of trade friction between the united states 
and japan not to mention the potential of a further downturn in 
the us economy matsushita is taking a big risk analysts say 
the biggest problem is the negative image of japanese buying 
up everything in the us said rodney harada an analyst for 
merrill lynch in tokyo one of the biggest reasons i was 
surprised by the deal was because matsushita has always been 
careful to improve its image before 
apart from universal pictures which also produced such hits as 
et the extraterrestrial mcas holdings include a robust 
television division featuring winners like murder she wrote 
and quantum leap 
mca records carries the popular teen vocalist tiffany as well 
as the sultry star sheena easton 
mca which earned 191 million last year on revenues of 34 
billion also owns a book publishing division theme parks and real

a 2200 gift by a farsighted poet 72 years 
ago has swelled nearly one hundredfold and will be used to 
establish a home for the elderly retarded 
henry c burns who died in 1918 a childless widower left 
220721 in trust along with a collection of his poetry and prose 
he directed that the trust be used to fund housing for the elderly 
retarded once it reached 175000 
the account held at pittsburgh national bank passed that 
amount about a year ago bank officials said and now stands at 
almost 215000 
in accordance with the terms of the trust bank officials began 
soliciting proposals for the home when the account surpassed the 
175000 point said john d culbertson a bank vice president 
the bank named fidelity title amp trust co at the time of burns 
death was instructed in the will to give the money to city county 
or state authorities whichever shall give the best assurance 
of establishing such a home 
city and state officials deferred to allegheny county which 
already contracts with agencies for services for older citizens 
the county began site searching this month 
a gift from a trust happens occasionally but not in this 
order of magnitude said raymond firth deputy director of the 
countys mental health program 
county officials said they may seek funds from private 
foundations to add to the trust and may establish more than one 
group home firth said 
advancements in medicine have increased the life span of 
retarded people and the need for housing firth said 
burns will instructed that the home be named our fathers 
relief accumulated fund home for aged and infirm people he also 
stipulated that bound copies of musings of a blind man a 
collection of his poems and prose writings were to be kept at the 
home for general use and reading

officials of pittsburgh nationl bank dont know what happened to 
the volumes which were last referred to in records in march 1924 
culbertson speculated that the books may have been stored in the 
banks downtown vault which was swamped in a 1936 flood

move over jose canseco shove aside 
barry bonds make room for gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee 
the booming trading card market already crowded with baseball 
hockey football basketball bowling and golf cards has a new 
contender astronaut cards 
they are the idea of ed white iii whose father was one of three 
astronauts who died in the launchpad fire of the apollo i 
spacecraft in 1967 the others were grissom and chaffee 
white has paid tribute to the three apollo astronauts in series 
no 1 of spaceshots which he bills as the trading cards of the 
future he says the cards are drawing the attention of card 
collectors and space buffs 
were advertising in several spaceoriented publications with 
a mailin form and a tollfree telephone number said white who 
lives in houston he was on mississippis gulf coast to visit 
relatives 
white said he was a baseball card and coin collector in the 
1960s and when he read a newspaper column about three years ago 
describing the value of old cards he pulled his collection out of 
the attic 
i was surprised white said the baseball card collection 
was worth five times the coin collection 
that is when the idea came to him 
he was in the telecommunications business at the time and the 
space card project was a hobby he sold his business earlier this 
year so that he and a friend jim roettger could devote their full 
attention to the cards 
spaceshots are produced by their dallasbased company space 
ventures inc 
white said he and roettger hope to put out four sets a year 
with each set containing 110 cards eventually we will also 
package them in smaller sets like baseball cards he said 
white said 25 percent of the proceeds will be donated to the 
astronaut memorial which is under construction at the kennedy 
space center in florida the monument will honor those astronauts 
who lost their lives aboard apollo i the space shuttle challenger 
and four who died in training before 1967

bands of jewish zealots are burning shops and 
threatening jerusalem merchants to force the firing of arab 
workers and the intimidation campaign is drawing angry comparisons 
with racist treatment of jews 
on monday police arrested four followers of slain extremist 
rabbi meir kahane on suspicion of involvement in the incitement 
politicians ranging from the left to the right joined in protesting 
the violence 
for anyone familiar with jewish history it brings to mind 
difficult pictures from our past justice minister dan meridor of 
the rightwing likud bloc said on israel radio such things must 
be uprooted we should not tolerate expressions of racism 
he pointed particularly to efforts to force shopkeepers to 
display signs saying i dont employ arabs chillingly similar 
to signs disavowing employment of jews that appeared in german 
shops before the holocaust six million jews were killed by the 
nazis 
i can remind you where and when it appeared on storefronts 
jews dont work here said lawmaker yossi sarid of the liberal 
citizens rights movement 
jerusalem police spokesman aharon elhayani said four suspects 
all followers of kahanes kach movement were arrested on charges 
of threatening shopowners incitement and causing damage 
he identified three as kach spokesman noam federman and 
activists tiran pollack and baruch marzel the fourth was not 
identified 
israel radio said police were conducting an intensive 
investigation of the threats and violence 
the antiarab campaign plays on jewish fears following a series 
of revenge attacks on israelis for the deaths of 17 palestinians in 
police gunfire during stonethrowing riots on jerusalems temple 
mount in october 
the attacks spurred calls to replace the thousands of 
palestinians from the occupied territories and annexed east 
jerusalem who work in israel often as trash collectors restaurant 
workers and at other lowpaying jobs 
federman told israel radio prior to his arrest that the party 
was not using violence but he admitted kach was trying to persuade 
shop owners to fire arabs 
we have approached shopkeepers including one whose shop was 
burned and asked them to fire the arabs he did not fire them so 
its reasonable to believe that angry citizens did it and i 
understand them federman said 
the campaign against employing arabs began shortly after the 
shooting death of kahane in new york on oct 5 the suspected 
gunman is an arabamerican 
groups of young jewish men have paid visits to shopkeepers in 
the predominantly orthodox jerusalem neighborhoods of beit israel 
and geulah urging them to dismiss arab workers slogans were 
spraypainted on the walls of stores saying a warning to the 
employer of the arabs 
in beit israel walls were plastered with posters that said 
employing arabs in our midst is dangerous to life we are not 
ready to live in danger and permanent fear just because the 
merchants who employ arabs want to make some extra money 
the posters were signed by residents and rabbis of the 
neighborhood 
although dozens of arabs still work in beit israel only a few 
of the original 40 remained at the nearby bukharian market 
newspaper reports said monday 
about two weeks ago a butcher shop was set ablaze in beit 
israel a grocery store was burned in the neighborhood sunday 
night and the writing on its wall said death to the arabs 
this month they started to threaten with slogans painted on 
the walls outside we fired the arabs and still they came and 
burned the shop said the grocerys owner aryeh moshe 
another shopkeeper mordechai mizrahi was stabbed in the arm 
earlier this month by a kach supporter while trying to defend his 
arab employee the arab amad abu sina suffered serious wounds 
now mizrahis butcher store features a sign no arabs 
employed here 
we defended the arab as we would defend anybody who is 
attacked in the store mizrahi told the daily maariv but when 
we speak of income its another matter we have no choice if we 
employ arabs we starve people are not ready to buy the goods when 
they see than an arab had touched them

president mikhail s gorbachev forcefully warned 
saddam hussein monday that the unity of those nations allied 
against iraqi aggression cannot be broken 
another soviet official meanwhile accused baghdad of breaking 
a promise to allow the departure of 1000 soviets still in iraq and 
threatened a tougher attitude by moscow if they were not 
permitted to leave 
as the united states sought united nations approval this week of 
a resolution authorizing the use of military force if iraq does not 
withdraw from kuwait by jan 1 the soviet union embarked on a new 
round of meetings with officials from iraq and saudi arabia 
gorbachev and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met 
with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in the kremlin monday to 
reiterate the soviet demand that iraq withdraw troops from kuwait 
shevardnadze will meet with saudi foreign minister saud alfaisal 
on tuesday 
gorbachev told aziz to ask saddam to rethink the iraqi position 
because baghdads destiny is in the hands of its leadership and 
time is slipping away the official tass news agency reported 
the soviet leader told aziz that if iraq wants to avoid the 
worst it must leave kuwait free western hostages and permit all 
foreigners to leave tass said saddams arguments that kuwait is 
iraqi land and that iraq was threatened by its neighbor are not 
taken seriously the news agency quoted gorbachev as saying 
aziz replied he would take gorbachevs message to saddam and he 
indicated that a bureaucratic accident had resulted in the 
delay of the departure of the soviet specialists tass reported 
answering questions from legislators in the supreme soviet 
parliament about the possibility of a conflict in the persian gulf 
involving the united states gorbachev said the crisis was a test 
of the new postcold war cooperation 
our position remains based on principles and it includes the 
following aggression is inadmissible it should be punished and 
the preaggression state should be restored gorbachev said his 
voice booming 
we are in favor of preserving a unity of action in the 
framework of the united nations and the security council 
thats important he said 
and we are reaffirming that we are going to cooperate with 
everybody the united states the permanent members of the 
security council all the members of the security council and the 
united nations organization arabs europeans etc so as to 
leave no pretext and no hope for the saddam hussein regime that it 
can break this unity gorbachev said pounding the lectern 
he said saddams aggression could not be allowed to prevail 
because we are just moving away from the cold war when 
everything was decided from a position of force 
gorbachev said the soviet union would discuss with other un 
security council members whether a new resolution needed to be 
adopted 
the soviet union has given its qualified consent to the use of 
force in the ggulf but is pushing for a diplomatic settlement it 
has urged the bush administration to be patient for another two 
months 
also monday soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin 
said iraq had agreed to allow 1000 soviets mostly contract 
workers to leave during november but only about 350 people were 
permitted to do so 
there were about 8000 soviets including several hundred 
military advisers in iraq when it invaded kuwait on aug 2 about 
3000 soviets including women and children were allowed to leave 
shortly after the invasion and about 1000 left during september 
and october 
churkin said iraq had agreed to allow another 1000 to leave in 
november but was not living up to its promise iraq is not 
keeping its agreement that our citizens will not be prevented from 
leaving he said this is totally abnormal and unacceptable 
he said if iraq does not immediately remove obstacles and 
allow our citizens to leave this will complicate the present 
situation even further and force us to take a tougher attitude

the supreme court on monday refused to kill 
two fairhousing lawsuits stemming from newspaper real estate 
advertisements showing only white models posing as homeowners 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that forces 
developers of a virginia condominium community to defend themselves 
in a jury trial against allegations they violated federal law 
the suits center on ads that appeared in the washington post 
over a 17month period beginning in 1985 for colonial village a 
condo community in arlington just across the potomac river from 
the district of columbia 
the suits were filed by girardeau spann a black resident of 
washington who is a professor at georgetown universitys law 
school and two advocacy groups the metropolitan washington 
planning and housing association and the fair housing council of 
greater washington 
named as defendants are colonial village inc and its parent 
firm mobil land development corp a subsidiary of the oil 
company 
the lawsuits allege that the defendants violated the fair 
housing act by featuring only white models in ads that appeared in 
the post the suits said the ads were racially preferential and 
discriminatory and they sought an injunction and monetary damages 
a federal trial judge in 1987 threw out the suits ruling they 
had been filed too late 
but the us circuit court of appeals here reinstated them last 
march 13 and sent the dispute back to us district judge harold 
greene for trial

the supreme court revived a longstanding legal 
battle monday in which animal rights groups are trying to save four 
monkeys used for medical research 
the justices said they will decide whether a federal agency 
should have been allowed to transfer the groups lawsuit against it 
from state to federal court where the suit was killed 
if the animal rights groups win in the high court their fight 
will be sent back to a maryland state court if the justices had 
rejected the groups appeal their legal fight would have ended 
the controversy dates back to 1981 alex pacheco then a george 
washington university student said the research business for which 
he worked as a volunteer did not provide sufficient food and water 
sanitation or veterinary care for 17 macaque monkeys 
only four of the original group of 17 are the subjects of the 
legal fight five have been moved to the san diego zoo and eight 
have died or been killed 
in a federally funded project at its silver spring md 
laboratory the institute for behavioral research was studying the 
ability of monkeys to use limbs after nerves were severed 
maryland police seized the monkeys in late 1981 and the 
national institutes of health a federal agency assumed custody of 
the animals they eventually ended up at tulane universitys delta 
regional primate research center in covington la 
nih was sued in 1988 by pacheco and the group he founded people 
for the ethical treatment of animals and two other animal rights 
groups international primate protection league and louisiana in 
support of animals 
the groups filed their lawsuit in a state court but the nih had 
the case transferred to a federal court eventually the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals ordered the lawsuit dismissed 
the issue to be decided by the supreme court is whether the 
federal agency should have been allowed to remove the lawsuit from 
the state court

two state lawmakers filed a bill monday to prevent 
singing groups like the pop duo milli vanilli from giving the 
audience nothing but lip service in massachusetts 
if you pay real money for a concert you ought to get real 
live music in return said rep kevin poirier 
the bill would require promoters to disclose whetherany part of 
a performance consists of prerecorded vocals ticket agents would 
also be required to notify concertgoers of plans for the headline 
performer to use prerecorded vocals under the bill ticket agents 
could be fined up to 5000 and promoters up to 50000 for 
violations 
similar legislation has been proposed in new york and new 
jersey both were introduced before the revelation two weeks ago 
that the milli vanilli duo of fabrice morvan and rob pilatus did 
not sing in concerts or on their album no action was taken on the 
legislation in either state 
new yorks bill would have gone further than the proposed 
legislation in massachusetts and new jersey requiring disclosures 
in advertisements 
its time to stop the phoney road shows said rep william 
vernon cosponsor of the massachusetts legislation 
carl freed executive director of the north american concert 
promoters association said lipsyncing has become more prevalent 
in live acts because performers are expected to do complicated 
dance routines 
in a recent concert tour madonna performed a duet with a dancer 
who lipsynced a song that warren beatty sang on her album 
instead of forcing promoters and ticket sellers to disclose 
lipsyncing freed said the artists should tell their fans what 
they do in performance the music industry may not be inclined to 
take action unless ticket sales drop off at concerts where the 
singing is staged he said

the supreme court refused monday to reinstate 
a new york parental rights law that barred many men from vetoing 
the adoptions of their illegitimate children 
the justices without comment left intact a ruling by new 
yorks highest court that the law violated fathers constitutional 
rights 
until a 1979 ruling by the nations highest court fathers of 
children born out of wedlock had no parental rights 
but in a series of decisions since the court has said an unwed 
father may challenge a mothers putting the child up for adoption 
if he has manifested a significant paternal interest in the 
child 
under the invalidated new york law a significant paternal 
interest had to be proved in three ways 
the father had to have lived with the mother or the child 
during the six months before the child was placed for adoption 
he had to openly acknowledge his fatherhood 
he had to have paid for pregnancy and birth expenses 
in striking down the law last july the new york court of 
appeals said the requirement that the father openly live 
with the mother before a childs placement for adoption neither 
legitimately furthers the states interest nor sufficiently protect 
that fathers and the law must therefore be declared 
unconstitutional 
the july ruling cast doubt on the proposed adoption by a nashua 
nh couple of a girl born out of wedlock in white plains ny 
two years ago 
lower courts had ruled that the adoption could be finalized 
without the consent of the childs biological father

washington ap the former wife of jazz saxophonist stan getz 
lost a supreme court appeal alleging new yorks divorce law 
violates the rights of women 
the justices without comment on monday rejected arguments by 
monica getz that the state law favors men by permitting them to 
wage legal wars of attrition against their wives who often 
lack equal financial resources 
getz 63 sued for divorce in 1981 after mrs getz 56 went to 
court alleging her husband suffering from alcoholism and drug 
addiction abused her she sought a court order for family support 
payments and protection against getz 
the couple later made attempts at reconciliation before the 
divorce became final in 1987 a state jury ruled in getzs favor in 
granting the divorce he had accused his wife of infidelity and 
trying to poison him a state judge ruled that mrs getz is 
entitled to half her husbands royalties from the beginning of 
their marriage in 1956 to 1981 
in her appeal to the supreme court mrs getz said the case 
should have been resolved in new yorks family courts which are 
designed to expedite divorce cases to save legal fees rather than 
by trial courts that handle corporate disputes and other matters 
mrs getz said she has spent more than 600000 in legal fees 
and will be forced to use the proceeds from the couples mansion in 
irvington ny where she still lives to pay off the bills

visitors would have to pay to play in the 
florida keys under a state proposal to raise money to protect 
whats left of the fragile marine environment there 
the biological slide of the keys has pushed the stat department 
of natural resources to create the states first marine reserve 
funded by a 50cent road toll on the overseas highway a 1 flight 
fee at county airports and a 5 snorkeling charge 
like it or not keys waters that are not owned by the people 
in the keys but by the state as a whole are the most important 
national and international resource that we have said edwin 
conklin the agencys director of marine planning 
but independenceminded keys residents who once staged a mock 
secession from the union and declared themselves citizens of the 
conch republic when they became fed up with federal policies 
arent exactly buying into the proposal which goes before gov bob 
martinez and the cabinet on tuesday 
i just dont think we need this level of bureaucracy monroe 
county commissioner doug jones said 
if the fees are adopted the state expects to collect 10 
million a year to fund enforcement research and education projects 
in the reserve which would cover state waters roughly three miles 
into the atlantic and 10 miles into the gulf of mexico 
the 50cent toll would require congressional approval because 
us highway 1 which stretches south to key west is a federal 
road 
the airport fee would be paid by anyone flying into the keys 
commercial airports in key west and marathon and the snorkeling 
fee would be in the form of a 5 annual stamp similar to existing 
fishing license fees 
divers are a big user of the keys conklin said it is 
unfortunate that we have to ask for money but a few bucks which is 
what were asking for is not going to kill the industry 
access would be limited or barred in some threatened portions of 
one of the worlds prime coral reef tracts which drew 1 million 
visitors last year 
an operating license would be required for keys boaters even 
though legislation for a statewide boating license failed this 
year

computerenhanced xrays are showing promise in 
rapidly detecting coronary artery disease in people under 60 
without requiring the insertion of tubes or other equipment into 
the body radiologists said monday 
a technique called ultrafast computed tomography that uses such 
xrays to detect calcium in arteries could be highly accurate and 
costeffective in detecting coronary artery disease the doctors 
reported 
ultrafast ct appeared to be able to rule out significant 
coronary artery disease in 100 percent of the cases we studied 
said dr jerome breen of the mayo clinic in rochester minn 
he presented his findings at the 76th annual meeting of the 
radiological society of north america which began its fiveday run 
monday in chicago 
ultrafast ct was performed on 100 patients ages 23 to 59 who 
were sent to specialists for coronary angiograms primarily because 
of symptoms such as chest pain or chest tightness that suggested 
coronary artery disease breen said 
an angiogram requires that an artery usually in the groin be 
punctured and a tube threaded up into the chest arteries that feed 
the heart an xray dye is then injected into the heart arteries 
and xrays are taken of them 
the accuracy of the ultrafast ct was determined by comparing its 
results to the results of angiograms taken on each of the patients 
breen reported 
in every case in our study if no calcium was detected on ct 
there was no significant coronary disease seen on the angiogram 
breen said significant disease was defined as at least one 
coronary artery blocked by 50 percent or more 
ultrafast ct is exquisitely sensitive at detecting the 
presence of calcium in the arteries a sign of atherosclerotic 
disease breen said 
atherosclerosis is a buildup of patchy deposits that can clog 
arteries and may eventually lead to heart attacks 
detecting calcium on ultrafast ct does not necessarily mean 
serious disease but the more severe the calcification the more 
likely it is that significant disease is present he said 
dr daniel mark a cardiologist at duke university medical 
center said the test sounds promising but will require further 
study 
it does not seem to me theyve come out with something 
totally radically new he said noting that calcium deposits in 
arteries have long been linked with heart disease 
also many if not most heart patients are over 60 when 
calcium begins to appear in the arteries as a normal sign of aging 
limiting the tests usefulness he said in a telephone interview 
monday from durham nc 
because calcium is increasingly present as elderly people age 
the researchers limited their study to people under 60 breen said 
he said ultrafast ct is noninvasive painless and virtually 
riskfree the procedure is expected to compete in cost with 
conventional heartstress tests and to be performed in a few 
minutes he said 
however he emphasized that his results were preliminary and he 
said researchers should study more patients before the tests 
usefulness is established

mandatory retirement age for judges likely will affect many states 
with similar laws 
if the justices reach the constitutional issue whether such a 
law violates equalprotection guarantees both appointed and 
elected state judges will be affected if limited to a federal law 
banning age bias the ruling would affect only appointed state 
judges because the federal law does not apply to elected officials 
the st louisbased 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last 
march that missouris judges fall into the antibias laws 
exception for appointees on the policymaking level 
the appeals court also ruled that the states mandatory 
retirement age is constitutional because it is a rational way to 
insure a vigorous and healthy judiciary and to increase 
opportunities for younger people to serve as judges 
the 8th circuit courts ruling appears to conflict with a 
decision announced two months later by the new yorkbased 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals that allowed a 71yearold state judge 
from vermont to remain on the bench 
the 2nd circuit court ruled that appointed state judges are not 
appointees on the policymaking level and therefore are 
protected by the federal antibias law 
lawyers for missouri judges ellis gregory jr and anthony nugent 
jr urged the justices to resolve the conflicting rulings 
the supreme court has never ruled on the issue but in 1988 left 
intact new yorks policy of forcing elected judges to retire at age 
70 even though no such mandatory retirement is imposed on appointed 
judges in the state 
the courts four oldest justices are thurgood marshall 82 
harry a blackmun 82 byron r white 73 and john paul stevens 
70

leftist guerrillas kidnapped three 
american and two colombian engineers at an oil field in 
northeastern colombia over the weekend the staterun oil company 
ecopetrol said monday 
the americans were working on a pilot project for a new way of 
extracting oil an executive at a private oil company said on 
condition of anonymity 
al smith personnel director at natco a tulsa oklabased 
company said the three americans were employees of natco and that 
two of them come from tulsa and one from bakersfield calif 
as we understand it it was a nonviolent taking of these 
gentlemen from the site where they were working smith said 
adding that there had been no demands for the mens release 
he declined to release their names but ecopetrol spokesman 
william giraldo identified them as as robert hogan larry sands and 
john bagbey he said he could not confirm the spellings of their 
names 
more than 1000 people have been kidnapped in colombia so far 
this year officials say most of the blame falls on leftist 
guerrillas drug traffickers and common criminals looking for 
ransom money 
two men and a woman belonging to the procuban national 
liberation army abducted the american and colombian engineers 
sunday afternoon near the town of tibu in north santander 
province giraldo said in a telephone interview 
the rebels subsequently released one of the colombians who 
delivered the news of the abductions giraldo said 
the colombian engineer who was not released ignacio alonso was 
taken by the guerrillas to act as a translator giraldo said 
the national liberation army known by its spanish acronym eln 
has been attacking colombias oil infrastructure for years 
since 1986 the group has bombed the countrys main oil pipeline 
scores of times causing an estimated 700 million in losses 
the eln is trying to pressure the government to reduce the 
presence of us and other foreign oil companies in colombia 
the medellin cocaine cartel meanwhile on monday freed one of 
nine journalists it has kidnapped the cartel recently offered to 
surrender to colombian authorities in exchange for deals with 
prosecutors 
drug traffickers released magazine editor juan vitta because of 
a heart problem that required medical attention former medellin 
mayor juan gomez said in a live radio interview gomez said he 
talked briefly with vitta after vitta was freed in the northwestern 
city of medelin

the united states consulted with other 
security council members monday about a proposal authorizing 
military force to liberate kuwait it sets a jan 1 deadline for 
iraqi withdrawal 
the resolution would mark the second time in un history that 
the security council has authorized the use of force to counter 
aggression the first time was in 1950 in the korean conflict 
kuwait meanwhile was preparing a presentation including a 
videotape for the security council on tuesday to describe iraqi 
atrocities since the aug 2 invasion including the murder of 
children and the looting of hospitals 
the resolution would authorize member states cooperating with 
the government of kuwait unless iraq on or before jan 1 1991 
fully implements the foregoing resolutions calling for 
withdrawal to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the 
security council resolutions passed in response to iraqs invasion 
and occupation of kuwait and to restore international peace and 
security according to the proposed text 
the text of the resolution obtained by the associated press 
says that despite all un efforts iraq refuses to comply with 
its obligation to implement un resolutions demanding withdrawal 
from kuwait in flagrant contempt of the council 
it cites chapter 7 of the un charter which authorizes the use 
of military force to counter aggression if sanctions and other 
steps fail 
foreign diplomats sai they expect the proposal to be amended 
before the vote later this week noting some member states are 
opposed to imposing a deadline for the withdrawal of saddam 
husseins troops from kuwait 
us officials said sunday the united states favors a jan 1 
deadline but could be flexible about a later date to ensure broader 
support other western diplomatic sources said a later deadline 
might be imposed to allow more time for negotiations 
judith kipper an associate at the brookings institute a 
washington research group said it would be a mistake for the bush 
administration to try to set a deadline 
to put a date is to put his saddams back to the wall and 
make things impossible said ms kipper who just returned from 
baghdad where she met with the iraqi president if we go 
public she said its a guarantee that well have to go to 
war 
the united states has the nine votes it needs to ensure passage 
by the 15member body and the vote is likely to be held thursday 
or friday opposition by any one permanent security council member 
the united states britain china france or the soviet union 
could block the resolution but a veto is considered unlikely 
on monday the united states consulted with the other four 
permanent council members in an attempt to agree on final wording 
of the resolution informal talks also were held with the other 
council members 
the united states is president of the council for the month of 
november and us officials want to secure a resolution on the use 
of force before turning the presidency over to yemen which has 
favored iraq in the past council presidents have the power to 
bring issues forward for votes or to suppress debate 
beside the five permanent members the current security council 
members are canada colombia cuba ethiopia finland ivory coast 
malaysia romania yemen and zaire

convicted nazi war criminal klaus barbie has cancer 
and needs special treatment from a french specialist his lawyer 
said monday 
deputy justice minister georges kiejman said the request by 
lawyer jacques verges amounted to an appalling media operation 
a public relations ploy and was unlikely to lead to barbies 
early release from prison 
barbie 77 was convicted of crimes against humanity in july 
1987 and sentenced to life in jail following a lengthy trial in 
lyon where he had served as gestapo chief during the world war ii 
nazi occupation 
a sentence of life in prison is not a death sentence for lack 
of care said verges who defended barbie in his trial 
verges said barbie had suffered from cancer of the blood the 
past three months but did not specify whether it was leukemia 
verges said barbie serving his sentence in lyons st paul prison 
had been undergoing chemotherapy treatment the past month 
verges asked that top cancer specialist leon schwartzenberg 
examine barbie members of schwartzenbergs family died in nazi 
concentration camps 
the justice ministry said verges had been sent a response of a 
medical nature to his request that barbie be examined by 
schwartzenberg the ministry said the choice of doctor was up to 
his treating physicians 
i totally disagree with the principle of this operation 
kiejman said of verges effort to get schwartzenberg to examine his 
client 
kiejman said it was unlikely barbie could now benefit from an 
early release because of the reported illness 
medical pardons are always distributed with great parsimony 
he told reporters the only thing admitted is to put the dying in 
contact with his family according to the information i now have i 
dont believe we are in such a situation

us foreign relations have long been based on 
a state of permanent crisis but with the end of the cold war 
the united states needs to reconsider its place in the world sen 
daniel p moynihan said monday 
we have very little preconceived thoughts moynihan a new 
york democrat said as he opened the first of three hearings on the 
enr we want to make a record and keep this issue 
before the senate 
moynihan a member of the foreign relations committee said that 
the us government has been shaped by three factd of the cold waors the 
emergence 
of the president as commanderinchief the secrecy system in 
which much of what the executive branch does is unknown to congress 
and the public and the socalled permanent crisis which began 
with the world wars and extended through the cold war 
norman ornstein a resident scholar at the american enterprise 
institute said he was dismayed that there has been no significant 
public debate on what role the united states should play in the 
postcold war world 
the world and the american position in it is different now and 
we have to respond to that he said 
geoeconomics will have a greater influence than geopolitics in 
the future and as a result we wont be choosing our alliese were 160

stanislaw tyminski found out monday that 
becoming a real contender for polands presidency had one immediate 
result chaos 
journalists packed his press center clamoring for specifics 
about his economic program bodyguards tried to keep order a 
staffer painted her fingernails 
his peruvian wife who speaks almost no polish was near tears 
tyminski who left his homeland 21 years ago and returned only 
this fall scored a stunning election upset on sunday when placed 
second in balloting for the presidency he will face solidarity 
leader lech walesa in a runoff on dec 9 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki finished a humiliating third 
behind tyminski and resigned monday 
tyminski a 42yearold millionaire businessman is an 
incongruous sight in economically strapped poland with his aviator 
glasses and fancy italian suits 
but the secret of his campaign success may have been his 
promises that the wealth will rub off 
after this victory i will roll my sleeves up go to work and 
make this country rich and prosperous it will be better within a 
month he boasted at a news conference 
my candidacy is not a political candidacy it is an economic 
one he added in an interview 
tyminski who holds polish canadian and peruvian citizenship 
says he left poland penniless going first to sweden as a tourist 
and then emigrating to canada 
he started a cable television outfit and a restaurant in the 
amazon port of iquitos peru and then returned to canada where he 
runs transduction ltd a computer automation firm near toronto he 
leads the libertarian party of canada a tiny party that has no 
representative in parliament 
for all his personal wealth tyminski is hardpressed to outline 
his solution to polands economic woes 
capitalism will start when people have disposable income he 
said fidgeting we must change the banking system which is 
stalinist we need to have better division of the budgets like the 
famous pie drawings 
tyminski raised eyebrows in poland with his freespending 
campaign which he financed himself asked how much he spent he 
said he did not know 
we have two boxes packed with receipts he said adding that 
his wife graciela perez handled the campaign finances 
on monday mrs tyminski appeared distressed and distracted 
frequently blinking her eyes she did not leave her husbands side 
asked what she thought of the campaign mrs tyminski said in 
english its interesting 
the couple have three children and tyminski also has a son by a 
first marriage 
in the course of the campaign tyminski became the subject of a 
state prosecutors slander investigation after accusing prime 
minister mazowiecki of treason for his economic policies 
tyminski assailed what he said were unfair press reports about 
him during the campaign he denied he was refused service into the 
army as a youth because of mental illness and dismissed reports he 
traveled to libya in the 1980s 
the candidate also denied that he has called for the development 
of nuclear weapons for poland 
i do not want the atom bomb in poland he said adding 
cryptically but it saved my mothers life he was apparently 
referring to radiation treatments his mother received for cancer 
he expressed confidence about facing the popular walesa 
i will win these elections he said i am not afraid of 
walesa i am not afraid of anyone 
he said he looked forward to the next phase of the campaign but 
added that he wanted to concentrate on the countrys future and 
not my past

a federal advisory panel won qualified support 
monday for setting mathematical standards for students in specific 
grades but was urged to measure achievement in ways that avoid 
invidious comparisons 
the national assessment governing board heard testimony from 
educators representing both public and private schools on its plan 
to define what students in grades four eight and 12 must know in 
math to obtain one of three levels basic proficient and advanced 
when tested by the national assessment of educational progress 
naep 
mandated by congress naep is the only nationally representative 
and continuing assessment of what american students know and can do 
in various academic subjects the 24member board sets policy for 
naep popularly called the nations report card 
normally naep tests simply describe how students perform without 
judgement if the proposed standards are approved results of the 
1990 naep test will be the first to measure students actual 
performance against established achievement standards 
frank betts of the association for supervision and curriculum 
development said the public must be cautioned against inappropriate 
use of naep test results which are based on sampling 
such comparisons or rank ordering based on these data are at 
best misleading and at worst positively dangerous from the 
statistical viewpoint he said 
betts added i believe there is a very real potential for 
further harm in reporting three levels of achievement my fear is 
that the inappropriate use of data will lead to invidious 
comparisons 
the 1990 math exam to be released next year is the first naep 
assessment to provide statelevel data on a voluntary basis in 
eighth grade only each of 37 states in the trial state program 
will have the option of using achievement levels to report results 
in addition to the previous scoring system 
mary johnson of the district of columbia public schools 
questioned the use of the terms basic proficient and advanced 
in describing the achievement levels if renamed proficiency levels 
one two and three johnson said students might feel more positive 
about their achievements at each level 
roy truby executive director of the board acknowledged that 
the board struggled with the notion that the three levels were 
in essence tracking tracking is a controversial process in which 
students are grouped based on academic performance he added 
however that the proficient level is the level we hope all 
students will achieve 
joyce mccray of the council for american private education noted 
a concern about the relationship between test content and 
curriculum but said the concept of three levels allows 
flexibility and we all agree that appropriate achievement goals are 
probably more easily defined in mathematics than in other areas of 
the curriculum 
according to the boards resolution proficient level for 
each grade represents solid academic performance while the 
basic level denotes partial mastery of fundamental knowledge 
and skills the advanced level signifies superior 
performance such as that needed at 12th grade to show 
readiness for rigorous college courses

the two top british commanders in 
the persian gulf on monday predicted allied forces would defeat 
demoralized iraqi forces in days or weeks if war breaks out 
lt gen sir peter de la billiere and air chief marshal sir 
patrick hine said the allies already have air and naval superiority 
and will be able to match iraqs ground forces once reinforcements 
arrive 
i think it will be a swift war days or weeks de la 
billiere the commander of british forces in the gulf told a news 
conference here 
by removing the imbalance in ground forces we can win this 
operation if it comes to it in the days and weeks that gen de la 
billiere has referred to added hine the britishbased joint 
commander of the force 
the commanders provided the first insight into allied thinking 
since president bush announced this month he was sending 200000 
more us troops 
de la billiere said he meets daily with the us commander gen 
norman schwarzkopf 
the fresh us soldiers and 14000 british reinforcements now 
heading to the gulf will bring the multinational troop strength to 
more than 500000 by midjanuary 
iraq currently has about 430000 troops in and around kuwait 
plus 250000 reinforcements iraqi president saddam hussein said he 
was dispatching 
de la billiere said saddam will be taking a very severe risk 
by weakening his other borders to deploy more troops to kuwait 
if he were to take that risk and redeploy that number then i 
believe we will still have the forces in theater to fight a 
decisive battle and bring it to a fairly speedy conclusion the 
general said 
iraq has sizable troop deployments along its borders with 
turkey a nato member and with iran its foe during an eightyear 
war that ended 1988 
the british commanders said the allies hope to minimize 
casualties by softeningup iraqi ground forces with air and 
artillery strikes before sending troops and tanks across the border 
into kuwait 
im confident the softeningup process will be effective and 
will enable any offensive operations if were asked to do them 
to be conducted with a degree of initiative on our side and 
assurance that we are not battering our head against a castle 
wall said de la billiere 
some iraqi defenses will certainly need tackling and dealing 
with he said but barriers such as tank trenches filled with 
gasoline arent the sort of stuff that you stop armies with 
hine said he hoped an operation could be done not to endanger 
western hostages including some being kept as human shields at 
strategic sites but he added its not a driving 
consideration 
i think they will look after these hostages well with an eye 
to events after a war is all over he said 
the british commanders said they didnt want to underestimate 
the fighting capability of the iraqi army especially its regular 
forces or the quality of some of its equipment 
but de la billiere said he wondered whether the kuwaiti 
occupation hadnt severely blunted the motivation of the iraqi 
troops because it has brought them nothing but deprivation at 
home and distaste and dislike by the rest of the world 
i think many of them will feel they are fighting for a lost 
cause indeed they are the general said 
hine said saddam seems to be making policy weekbyweek in 
response to reactions from various countries with the aim of 
dividing the allies and delaying any military action 
when he can see that military action against him is perhaps 
inevitable then we may see some movement in terms of withdrawal or 
partial withdrawal or something of that nature at the moment it 
seems theres been no real force put on him to withdraw now 
he said 
hine said a un resolution with a deadline for an iraqi 
withdrawal might help focus saddams attention 
at the united nations on monday the us consulted with other 
security council members about a proposal authorizing military 
force if iraq has not withdrawn from kuwait by jan 1

ronald reagans autobiography is a 
bestseller but sales of the former presidents memoir are lagging 
those of millies book the dogseyeview of life inside the 
bush white house 
millies book ghostwritten by barbara bush was no 3 on 
this weeks new york times nonfiction bestseller list five 
notches ahead of the weightier reagan book 
the lighthearted canine narrative held down the no 5 spot on 
the washington posts bestseller list while the former 
presidents 748page memoir came in at no 7 
millies book was brought out in september by william morrow 
amp co and has been perched on the bestseller charts for nine 
weeks an american life by reagan was published just three 
weeks ago 
its a bit of an unfair comparison jack mckeown publisher 
of simon amp schusters trade division said monday we certainly 
dont begrudge any success to millies book but they are 
appealing to quite difference audiences 
simon amp schuster is the publisher of the 2495 reagan 
autobiography 
millies book lionizes the presidents english springer 
spaniel wrapping a droll narrative of white house life and lore 
around scores of fullcolor pictures of millie in the oval office 
millie in the lincoln bedroom and millie mingling with celebrities 
george barbara and assorted grandchildren 
all the royalties from the 1795 book are going to barbara 
bushs literacy foundation mrs bush penned a similar book about 
an earlier pet dog c fred bush to raise money for charity when 
her husband was vice president 
sales of the reagan book are accelerating at the major book 
chains and all the vital signs point to big sales of an 
american life as a christmas gift book said mckeown 
but millies book is winning the race at the bookstore 
nearest the white house a crown books outlet on g street one 
block away 
millies the hottest item in the store said assistant 
manager larry hoffer its out the door people come in and buy 
10 15 each and then come back and buy more its a really cute 
gift idea 
some of the megapurchases are by people with white house 
connections who can get the books signed by the first lady and 
millie via a pawprint stamp 
the reagan book which has received lackluster reviews is 
selling well at crown but not as fast as nancy reagan did 
said hoffer 
the former first lady hit the bestseller lists last year by 
lashing back at critics and ungrateful children in her life story

un sanctions against iraq will take a long 
time to work because the countrys centralized economy allows 
saddam hussein to shift needed resources easily kuwaits finance 
minister said monday 
sheik ali khalifa alsabah also said saddam has no compunction 
about putting the needs of his military before those of the general 
population 
in a centralized economy you can shift resources alsabah 
said in a speech at the national press club as a result the 
sanctions will succeed only over a very long period 
sanctions virtually cutting off iraq from the rest of the world 
were imposed after saddam invaded kuwait on aug 2 
alsabah said the sanctions are also hurting iraq neighbors 
countries that traded heavily with baghdad in the past such as 
jordan egypt and turkey he said 
moreover the worlds lessdeveloped economies are suffering 
because the gulf crisis has produced an increase in the price of 
oil he said 
the rest of the world is also suffering from sanctions he 
said 
alsabahs pessimism about the effectiveness of the unimposed 
sanctions came as the united states prepared to ask the un 
security council to adopt a resolution that would authorize the use 
of force against iraq if necessary us officials have said a 
draft resolution sets a jan 1 deadline for iraq to get out of 
kuwait 
the councils five permanent members who have veto power are 
discussing the measure in new york a vote could come thursday 
after debate this week 
alsabah said kuwaiti officials are planning to recount to the 
security council some of the atrocities that are occurring in their 
country 
iraqi troops occupying kuwait have shot and killed young men in 
front of their families and raped the women he said the troops 
have pilfered the country of medical and factory equipment and 
stolen goods of every kind including food he added 
visitors to baghdad have reported that stores in that city are 
filled with canned goods from kuwait one of the reasons that 
sanctions have yet to bite hard on the iraqi people 
so far iraq has shown little willingness to heed the un or 
arab league resolutions that have called on saddam to withdraw from 
kuwait 
that leaves very little choice he said 
alsabahs pessimistic remarks about sanctions underscored those 
make sunday by brent scowcroft president bushs national security 
adviser and defense secretary dick cheney

us concern over the persian gulf crisis has 
produced the highestlevel meeting between the united states and 
cuba since the two countries opened diplomatic offices in each 
others capitals 13 years ago us and cuban officials said 
monday 
under secretary of state robert kimmitt the thirdranking 
official at the state department met sunday with the chief of 
cubas diplomatic mission here jose arbesu 
previously the most senior us official to meet with cubas 
chief diplomat here has been the assistant secretary for latin 
american affairs 
a spokesman at the cuban mission said the sunday meeting was 
limited to a discussion of the consultations on the gulf at the 
un security council of which cuba occupies one of the 10 
nonpermanent seats 
a us official said kimmitt extended an invitation to cuba to 
attend a security council meeting on the gulf set for thursday 
the united states has been pushing hard for a resolution 
authorizing the use of force against iraq 
cuba has expressed support for the restoration of kuwaiti 
sovereignty but also has called for efforts to find a peaceful 
solution 
the united states and cuba consult periodically on immigration 
and other issues but the bush administration has ruled out the 
possibility of normalizing relations with the island accusing cuba 
of human rights abuses 
the two nations broke off full diplomatic relations 30 years ago 
this coming january

berendzen who resigned after being charged with making obscene 
telephone calls said monday he wants to remain on the faculty

to the university i love so dearly

the supreme court on monday left intact 
rulings aimed at prohibiting the american medical association from 
boycotting chiropractors 
the justices without comment rejected arguments by the ama 
that its tactics did not violate federal antitrust laws 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals based in chicago last 
february upheld a federal judges order aimed at making it clear 
that ama members may associate professionally with chiropractors 
without violating ama ethical standards 
the case stems from a complaint filed by four licensed 
chiropractors against the ama in 1976 the chiropractors accused 
the ama of trying to drive them out of business by branding them as 
quacks 
over the years the ama has settled other antitrust suits 
brought by chiropractors and recently adopted a resolution that it 
is ethical for members to associate professionally with 
chiropractors 
but a judge in the case of the four who sued in 1976 ordered the 
ama to take steps to eliminate lingering effects from the amas 
boycott 
the judge said the ama must make its members aware they are free 
to associate with chiropractors 
the 7th circuit court upheld the judges ruling that the ama 
failed to prove it was acting in the interest of patients when it 
conducted the boycott 
the case is ama vs wilk 90542

heres an advertisement that 
practically jumps off the page want to purchase any art work by 
artist adolf hitler 
hitlers name is in bold type as if it needed to be 
betsy gainey a wrightsville beach real estate broker placed 
that ad in last fridays wall street journal as part of her 
international search for hitlers art 
the german dictator was struggling to make it as an artist when 
he began his political career 
ms gainey who said shes working for an investor who doesnt 
want to be identified said shes already had quite a few calls 
to her tollfree line most of them from the curious 
very honestly bluntly put theyre very nosy she said i 
have had a couple people say they think they may know where some 
is whether or not they can deliver i dont know 
ms gainey who said she often takes such assignments said her 
investor wanted hitler paintings for their artistic value 
its just someone who has the money who wants to invest for 
the art value itself not for the philosphy or whatever said ms 
gainey who professes no particular expertise in art 
but billy f price a texas compressor manufacturer who has made 
an avocation of identifying hitler artworks says buyer 
beware 
he said its not too difficult to find watercolor landscapes 
being sold as the late german dictators creations the problem is 
detecting the real from the fake 
it will be very very unwise for a person to buy a hitler 
painting who doesnt check with some authorities he said in a 
telephone interview price published his own book in 1984 adolf 
hitler the unknown artist in which he cataloged authentic and 
fake hitler paintings 
price says he often sees advertisements placed by people seeking 
to buy or sell hitler art and that many of them contact him 
i got a fax the other day from venezuela this man wanted 3 
million for a hitler painting and said he would wait 48 hours 
before he sold it to the japanese price said price doesnt give 
such offers much credence

the bush administrations top military 
officials defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell 
will be conspicuous by their absence tuesday when the senate begins 
hearings on the buildup toward an offensive military option in 
the persian gulf 
the hearings scheduled after president bush decided to send an 
additional 200000 troops to the gulf get under way with members 
of congress pressing for closer collaboration on gulf policy 
however cheney and powell will delay their appearances before 
the senate armed services committee until next week after un 
action on a resolution authorizing military force against iraq 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the panel 
said monday that cheney is quite willing to testify before the 
committee and will do so on monday 
powell also is scheduled to appear before the panel 
after a meeting with the committees chairman sen sam nunn 
dga warner said cheney had delayed his testimony until next 
monday to have a report from secretary of state baker on the un 
resolution 
secretary james a baker iii is in new york to press the united 
nations security council to approve military force to free kuwait 
if iraq refuses to withdraw its troops baker is to testify on 
wednesday of next week before the senate foreign relations 
committee 
meanwhile rep patricia schroeder dcolo asked that the 
house be called back from adjournment to discuss the un 
resolution lest war be raging by the time congress returns as 
scheduled in january 
several congressional leaders including senate republican 
leader bob dole asked earlier this month for a special session 
but that idea quickly died and there was no indication of action 
on schroeders request 
the absence of cheney from this weeks witness list and the 
lack of any guarantee he would testify at all had been portrayed 
as a part of struggle between nunn a possible 1992 democratic 
challenger for bushs job and the white house 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo a member of the committee said in 
an interview that the hearings were illtimed and the 
administration had every reason to wait before testifying 
the timing he said is what you do when your purpose is more 
political than policy not partisan politics national politics 
the chairman is opening a presidential campaign wallop said 
referring to nunn 
nunn invited cheney and powell to appear before the panel nearly 
two weeks ago to discuss the administrations policy since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the military leaders have had prominent roles in defending 
bushs decision to send the additional troops to the gulf to 
provide a potential attack force and many in congress have said 
the administration has yet to justify such a strategic shift 
with baker cheney and powell unavailable until next week the 
witness list for this weeks armed services sessions reads less 
like a highlevel policy consultation than like the lineup for 
recent television talk shows 
on tuesday former defense secretary and cia director james 
schlesinger will testify during a morning session with a closed 
briefing by intelligence officials scheduled in the afternoon 
former joint chiefs of staff chairmen william j crowe jr and 
david c jones will appear on wednesday morning and former 
secretary of state henry kissinger is scheduled to appear that 
afternoon 
thursdays hearing includes former navy secretary james webb 
former assistant defense secretary richard perle and edward luttwak 
of the center for strategic and international studies 
bushs announcement that he was greatly increasing the us 
deployment in the persian gulf and adding the offensive 
capability touched off criticism by lawmakers including nunn who 
said the administration had failed to justify a policy shift from a 
defensive to offensive stance 
elsewhere on capitol hill a senior member of the house armed 
services committee sent a letter to house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash urging him to call back the house to debate the un 
resolution 
rep schroeder who contended two weeks ago that it would be 
useless for congress to return in a special session to debate a 
hypothetical action said monday a possible resolution makes a 
session necessary 
all of a sudden the time has come schroeder said in a 
telephone interview it would look awfully silly if we come back 
and this thing is raging 
congress included in its adjournment resolution in late october 
a provision giving the democratic leadership in consultation with 
the republican minority the authority to call congress back in an 
emergency 
schroeder said she did not think congress would oppose the un 
resolution but we have to at least debate it 
meanwhile a delegation of 19 house members left on sunday for a 
weeklong visit to the persian gulf region

moving men were hauling margaret thatchers 
belongings out of 10 downing st on monday and the western worlds 
longestserving leader was shopping around for office space 
such is the banality and the swift brutality of the fall of a 
british leader 
i think she will write her memoirs but at the moment i think 
she could write the guide to fast house moving carol thatcher 
37 said in a television interview after helping her mother pack 
over the weekend 
on monday night mrs thatcher gave a party for the 200 staff at 
downing street ranging from cleaning people to her topmost 
advisers and declared life begins at 65 and i shall be working 
for the future 
the party was possible because mrs thatcher has longer than 
most to vacate 10 downing st the six to eight days it takes to 
elect a new leader of the governing conservative party following 
her decision last thursday to step down 
her predecessor james callaghan of the labor party had to get 
out with less than a days notice after mrs thatcher led the 
conservatives to victory in a may 3 1979 election 
within hours of the result being declared early on may 4 the 
moving men arrived and callaghan was gone shortly after midday 
then mrs thatcher moved in 
the furniture the silver plate the chandeliers the oil 
paintings and most else at no 10 a 17th century row house near 
the houses of parliament belong to the nation 
but after 11 years the occupant gathers things besides 
clothes in mrs thatchers case they include boxes of personal 
documents that may form the basis of a publishers dream the iron 
ladys memoirs 
there also are 1000 bouquets of flowers sent by wellwishers 
all over the world following mrs thatchers ouster as leader by 
the conservatives personal letters are coming in at more than 
1000 a day aides say 
speculation about mrs thatchers future range from 
tongueincheek suggestions that she run a european bank to 
becoming a countess and sitting in britains unelected and often 
somnolent upper house 
her memoirs will be hot property and offers abound for lecture 
tours 
aides say her priority is to find an office in central london 
from where she may operate some kind of foundation to promote the 
freemarket political philosophy of thatcherism 
i dont think she has decided anything a close aide said 
speaking on condition of anonymity her preoccupation at the 
moment is to get moved out of here into dulwich and to get an 
office 
michael gerson head of the moving firm mrs thatcher and her 
husband denis called in estimates he can get most of it into one 
large truck for the sevenmile journey to dulwich a southeast 
suburban district 
the thatchers bought a doublestorey house there in 1985 for 
about 400000 pounds now the equivalent of 800000 mrs 
thatcher whose political tenets include home ownership said it 
was a hedge against the thenrapidly rising house prices in 
southeastern england 
neighbors are ducking reporters and police are patroling the 
suburban road the security will remain a part of life for the new 
resident a permanent target of the irish republican army 
the thatcher offices will be under guard too 
for now her only office is one of the cramped rooms sometimes 
shared allotted to a rankandfile member of parliament 
it is not a role likely to suit her for long she wont do a 
heath and stay there in sullen discontent said a thatcher aide 
referring to edward heath now an ordinary mp whom mrs thatcher 
ousted as party leader in 1975 
last week the same party election rules that mrs thatcher 
turned against heath brought her own career to an end 
if tuesdays vote is inconclusive among the three contenders for 
the leadership there will be a final ballot on thursday 
mrs thatcher will move out the day after the winner is 
declared 
meanwhile its farewell parties flowers and some business as 
usual 
when president bush telephoned saturday to report on his visit 
to the persian gulf he caught mrs thatcher sorting out the main 
sitting room her daughter said 
an aide hastened in miss thatcher added saying drop that 
packing case prime minister the white house is on the 
telephone

education secretary lauro cavazos upset by 
predictions that four years of college soon may cost several 
hundred thousand dollars urged colleges and universities monday to 
make tough choices to cut costs 
cavazos insisted that colleges still are affordable although 
tuition increases during the 1980s averaged about 8 percent a year 
average tuition and fees for fall 1990 ranged from 884 at twoyear 
public colleges to 9391 at fouryear private colleges 
escalating costs of higher education have some analysts 
predicting that four years of college early in the next century 
may cost several hundred thousand dollars said cavazos 
cavazos stressed that the predictions are based on 
misperceptions about both the true cost of college and the 
availability of student financial aid yet he released a 
handbook entitled tough choices to help colleges examine 
institutional goals and priorities and make decisions to control 
spending 
if we are to keep higher education affordable colleges and 
universities are going to have to make serious efforts to control 
costs he told reporters each institution must identify its 
central mission and focus and then allocate resources accordingly 
with the understanding that no single institution can do everything 
well 
for example cavazos said colleges should consider merging 
duplicative services or programs and possibly eliminating programs 
including certain athletic or sports programs institutions also 
might consider coordinating services with nearby schools he said 
the handbook also advises school presidents to take the lead 
think longterm involve the entire institution and communicate 
well with all members of the institutions community 
cavazos also released a survey of college financial officials 
who said they could control expenditures more easily than they 
could raise revenues the college administrators cited as reasons 
for raising tuition increased academic expenditures declining 
state contributions and the desire to improve the institutions 
quality 
according to the survey institutions usually control 
expenditures by delaying or modifying new construction using more 
parttime faculty or freezing hiring imposing budget cuts and 
cutting services

commentators conceded monday they underestimated the depth of 
public unhappiness with westernprescribed economic reforms begun 
during 15 months of noncommunist rule and the credulity of a 
public most of whom were voting in their first democratic election 
for president 
stanislaw tyminski did not underestimate those factors now the 
emigre toronto businessman who spent 21 years in canada and peru 
and returned to his homeland only three months ago is a step away 
from being president 
while the two halves of solidarity represented by lech walesa 
and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki were trying to bury each 
other in an acrimonious battle for the presidency a freshfaced 
unknown from abroad slipped in and nearly stole the electorate 
the dark horse took advantage of a fight in the family said 
dariusz fikus editor of the government paper rzeczpospolita it 
is a defeat both for walesa and mazowiecki 
walesa founder of the east blocs first independent trade 
union polands only nobel peace laureate and creator of the first 
noncommunist government between the elbe and the pacific in 40 
years eked out 3996 percent of sundays vote 
mazowiecki who created a noncommunist government that began 
the dismantling of the hated former system and won poland respect 
and praise abroad drew only 1808 percent 
tyminski won 2310 percent based on his claim to be free of 
politics and to be a millionaire and therefore an expert in 
economic matters 
election returns showed he did best in rural areas and small 
towns where the benefits of a freer economy have so far been 
negligible young people waiting for housing and miners worried 
about their jobs also rallied to him 
voters new to democracy seemed to trust him because he looked 
the part with the sheen of a successful selfmade north american 
executive in the countryside people were surprised to learn from 
reporters that tyminski is an unknown in his adopted country of 
canada or that his libertarian party has no one in the federal or 
provincial assemblies there 
they distrusted lastminute criticisms of him in the press 
saying it reminded them of communist propaganda campaigns 
tyminski was willing to articulate the rage felt by that part of 
the population most immediately affected by the radical economic 
reform program generally endorsed by both solidarity candidates 
commentator piotr pacewicz wrote in mondays gazeta wyborcza 
that these people constituted a second poland who found no 
place for themselves in the poland run by solidarity had it not 
been for tyminski they would probably have stayed home he said 
in tyminski this second poland found a man who embodied 
their hostility to the solidarity state someone clean coming from 
outside the alignment in which communist memories are blending with 
the hardship of radical reform 
walesa told reporters after the election he had sensed a growing 
anger and feared it would be exploited by a third force he 
said thats why he launched his campaign of acceleration so 
that this disaffected bloc would not become alienated from 
solidarity forever 
in its postmortems the prime ministers camp was still pointing 
a finger at walesa blaming him for fanning the anger 
the war at the top unleashed by walesa has led to this 
groused mazowieckis election committee monday in a halfhearted 
recommendation to its supporters to oppose tyminski 
but in some ways mazowiecki was trapped in a vise between the 
demands of polands foreign creditors and the limited patience of 
his own people 
mazowieckis tough economic reform policies were drafted last 
fall in close cooperation with the international monetary fund 
which for years refused to unlock the door to desperately needed 
new foreign credits until poland got its economic house in order 
the plan mandated a wage cap and a governmentinduced recession 
that caused real wages to plummet 35 percent 
unemployment climbed from almost zero at the start of 1990 to 
over 1 million today 
tyminski pledged a fast turnaround in the economy and accused 
mazowiecki of treasonous mismanagement of the economy and wound 
up collecting 1 million more votes than the prime minister 
the returns and mazowieckis resignation monday night as prime 
minister may contain a cautionary lesson to the imf and western 
countries who want to see democracy succeed in eastern europe 
there is only so much austerity the west can realistically 
expect the new democratic governments of eastern europe to impose 
and still remain the government

the bush administration asked the supreme 
court on monday to kill a texas businessmans lawsuit that alleges 
government regulators caused the collapse of his healthy savings 
and loan 
assistant attorney general stuart m gerson said in oral 
arguments before the court that allowing the lawsuit to be heard 
could open the floodgates for scores of similar claims 
in earlier written arguments the government said that allowing 
the case to go forward could also restrict regulators options at 
a time of urgent need for swift and flexible intervention 
thomas m gaubert of dallas alleges in his suit that negligence 
by federal regulators who took over daytoday operations of his 
savings and loan irvingbased independent american savings 
association caused its financial ruin 
the regulators forced gaubert out of management in 1985 and 
replaced directors in 1986 state authorities closed the thrift in 
1987 
they regulators just came in and lied to us misled us and 
for all practical purposes extorted us gaubert said following 
the hearing we had no right to have any say in it 
gaubert a prominent democratic fundraiser who persuaded former 
house speaker jim wright dfort worth to intervene with federal 
regulators on his behalf is seeking compensation for 25 million 
worth of real estate he lost when his sampl failed 
we have not had our day in court said gauberts attorney 
abbe david lowell when the case is heard he claimed the facts 
will show these people regulators took unbelievably negligent 
actions 
the high court is expected to rule on the case by july 
the government contends that regulators seeking to restore a 
thrift to safer and sounder management practices are immune from 
such claims 
while the 5th us circuit court of appeals has ruled that 
gaubert can pursue is claim for 25 million it did not let him 
continue his bid to collect from the government the 75 million 
lost value of his independent american shares 
gerson told the court that the justice department has 132 cases 
stemming from the savings and loan crisis that seek damages from 
the government but lowell said only one is actually in the courts

reserve combat forces to be activated in the persian gulf crisis 
more than 45000 other army citizensoldiers put on active duty 
since august are in noncombat roles such as transportation or 
medical services the army said monday it had alerted an 
unspecified number of national guard and army reserve members from 
30 states and puerto rico that they may be called up soon for 
noncombat duty in desert shield 
separately the marine corps disclosed that it is sending to the 
gulf the 6th marine expeditionary brigade a regular unit of about 
15000 marines based at camp lejeune nc three marine 
expeditionary brigades already are in the gulf area and the 
pentagon announced nov 8 that the 5th marine expeditionary brigade 
of camp pendleton calif was heading there 
maj nancy j laluntas a spokeswoman at marine corps 
headquarters said the 6th brigade would link up in saui arabia 
with a squadron of ships carrying equipment and 30 days of supplies 
from norfolk va 
the army said the 48th infantry brigade mechanized of georgia 
and the 256th infantry brigade mechanized of louisiana were 
ordered to report for active duty friday also reporting will be 
two smaller combat units the 1st battalion of the 263rd armor from 
mullins sc and a battalion of the 152nd armor from oneonta 
ala 
the army gave no other details but officials said last week 
that the georgia brigade and the mullins battalion would form an 
independent unit for possible deployment with the 24th infantry 
division mechanized a regular army division from fort stewart 
ga already is in saudi arabia 
the louisiana brigade and the oneonta battalion are to bring to

bob harper spokesman for the mississippi army national guard 
said the 155th was told by the defense department last friday to 
expect to be activated about dec 7 
harper speculated that the 155th was not activated at the same 
time as the two other guard brigades because the armys national 
training center at fort irwin calif cannot handle all three 
brigades at the same time the brigades are to undergo desert 
warfare training at fort irwin before the pentagon decides whether 
they are proficient enough to be deployed to saudi arabia

activated with the 155th of mississippi although it was not 
included in mondays announcement

hundreds of people stayed away from the homes they fled over the 
weekend after heavy rains caused the second ruinous floods in two 
weeks 
one man was presumed dead in the deluge a pontoon bridge 
linking seattle and its eastern suburbs sank many residents had 
just managed to return home and start cleaning up earlier damage 
when the new rainstorms hit 
at least 2600 people were evacuated as 20 rainswelled rivers 
spilled their banks authorities said most of the flooding 
occurred west of the cascade mountains which form the northsouth 
spine of the state inundating much of western washington hardest 
hit were rural areas 
more rain but in less quantity was forecast for monday night and 
tuesday 
except for the chehalis river the worst is over said dick 
milne spokesman for the state division of emergency management 
a flood surge was moving down that river toward grays harbor on 
the coast and officials feared more evacuations downstream would 
be necessary 
at least six rivers set records for high water state officials 
who already tallied more than 40 million in flood damage earlier 
this month said that figure would soar they had no new figures 
yet 
a storm that dumped a record 3 inches of rain on seattle in two

the nations former chief sampl regulator 
testified monday that his 1987 meetings with five senators now 
subjects of an ethics investigation capped years of private 
threats designed to stop banking officials from curbing 
highflying thrift institutions 
edwin j gray only had time to read a 13page opening statement 
at the senate ethics committee hearings into the five senators 
ties to former sampl operator charles h keating jr 
but he immediately set the stage for confrontation with the 
senators by declaring that he was trying to stop risky investments 
by instutitions like keatings failed lincoln savings and loan 
while powerful politicians were trying to stop him on keatings 
behalf 
gray did not go into details on the conduct of the senators 
dennis deconcini dariz alan cranston dcalif john mccain 
rariz john glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr dmich 
but his testimony starting tuesday will be crucial in 
determining whether the senators made improper demands of 
regulators on behalf of keating a political contributor to all 
five 
gray former chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
that his meetings with the five senators in april 1987 when they 
intervened for keating capped years of private threats and 
public vilification designed not just to change particular 
decisions by the bank board but to render us unable to carry out 
our central responsibilities 
no one in washington with the slightest knowledge of this 
issue can have been ignorant of this situation or the effect it 
would have on the way the regulators received and interpreted 
messages from senators and congressmen 
gray is a crucial witness because because of his house banking 
committee testimony a year ago that deconcini offered a deal on 
keatings behalf when he cranston glenn and mccain met with him 
on april 2 1987 deconcini has vigorously denied proposing a deal 
earlier an aide to deconcini said her boss once asked her if 
there was a way to bring heat on gray 
nearly four months later the aide said she told deconcini it 
could be politically disastrous for him to intervene on keatings 
behalf with gray but he thanked me for my suggestion and said he 
was going to go ahead anyway 
deconcinis aide on banking issues laurie a sedlmayr 
testified on the fifth day of ethics committee hearings 
sedlmayr said she was aware keating wanted gray out of office 
and that deconcini also wanted him replaced 
deconcini wrote her a memo on dec 11 1986 citing press 
accounts of potential financial and ethical problems facing gray 
and asking anything we can do to bring heat 
she said she responded five days later saying it was probably 
unnecessary for him to take action and suggesting the senator 
stay out of this sedlmayr said keating was more aggressive 
than many other businessmen she dealt with 
i found him to be something of a zealot and i wasnt 
comfortable with that she said 
i think the senator probably thought i was overstating the 
case she added 
keating contributed 13 million to the campaigns and favorite 
causes of the keating five senators much of it while he was 
battling thrift regulators during an intense examination of his 
lincoln savings and loan the institution was seized by regulators 
in april 1989 and it could cost taxpayers more than 2 billion to 
cover the losses 
asked by committee special counsel robert s bennett what advice 
she gave her boss before the april 2 1987 meeting with gray ms 
sedlmayr said i told him i didnt think it was a good idea 
politically it was a mistake 
the aide said she was concerned that word of the meeting would 
leak to the news media a prediction that came true and that 
mr gray would misrepresent that meeting 
ms sedlmayr also was the second senatorial aide to back 
bennetts assertion that riegle was far more involved than he 
acknowledged in organizing the april 2 meeting with gray and a 
meeting april 9 1987 between all five senators and the regulators 
examining lincoln mccain aide gwendolyn van paasschen said last 
week she believed riegle was involved in setting up the meetings 
while riegle has denied organizing the meetings sedlmayr said 
she understood from deconcini that the first one meeting with gray 
was riegles idea 
she described herself as disturbed that deconcini told her to 
write riegle a letter inviting him to the april 9 meeting 
it was sort of why are you doing this he is just as 
interested in this issue as we are she said ms sedlmayr wrote 
in a chronology she prepared in december 1988 that each of the 
meetings was the brainchild of sen riegle and he had asked for 
the letter of invitation to cover himself to explain his 
attendance on april 9 
riegle said he went to the april 9 meeting with the san 
franciscobased regulators because of his expertise on the banking 
committee of which he is now chairman 
under crossexamination by riegle attorney thomas green ms 
sedlmayr said i was being flip when she wrote that the meetings 
with regulators were the brainchild of riegle 
when green asked her whether riegles suggestion that senators 
concerned about lincoln meet with gray was rather conventional 
she responded that it was 
ms sedlmayr also told green she had no reason to doubt that 
deconcini wanted riegle at the meeting with gray because riegle was 
an expert on banking matters

a federal judge broadened the constitutional issues 
in the cnnmanuel noriega tapes case monday saying basic fairness 
could allow him to block broadcast of the defendants prison phone 
conversations 
us district judge william hoeveler cited fairness again in 
warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free 
20 million in frozen noriegalinked bank accounts to pay defense 
lawyers or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the 
money was drugtainted 
i am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to 
be acquiring that the defendant is not going to be able to get a 
fair trial hoeveler said theres an obvious need by all of us 
in a case like this to show that our system in fact does work 
from top to bottom 
on the tapes issue the judge said transcripts of tapes handed 
over by cable news network last week were expected to be completed 
by late monday and will be discussed by all sides in a closed 
hearing wednesday morning 
hoeveler said he would rule by thursday on whether to maintain 
his order preventing the network from broadcasting the tapes made 
of calls the former panamanian leader made from his prison cell 
outside miami 
the judge emphasized he would review all cnns tapes not just 
those between noriega and his lawyers he said an 11th us circuit 
court of appeals opinion upholding his original gag order allowed 
him to consider broader questions than attorneyclient 
privilege 
cnn attorney terry bienstock protested saying the issue should 
not include matters such as pretrial publicity because the defense 
had not asked for such a ruling 
outside the court he said he was alarmed by the judges 
comments 
its bad enough that the courts engaging in this process of 
prepublication review he said but its more disturbing that 
the court is going broader than even the litigants are seeking 
noriegas lawyers were pleased with the handling of the tapes 
however 
how the devil can he ever receive a fair trial if cnns 
going to play his innermost private discussions with his lawyers 
planning his defense strategy said frank rubino noriegas lead 
attorney 
in the second part of mondays hearing the judge said he would 
postpone appointment of governmentpaid lawyers to replace rubinos 
defense team to give the government another chance to unfreeze 
noriegas foreign bank accounts 
prosecutors agreed in june to free the money but later said 
foreign governments had stepped in by filing their own confiscation 
orders against the 27 accounts 
hoeveler said he would order a hearing on the frozen accounts 
within 10 days to determine if the money was illegally earned 
noriega is facing up to 145 years in prison on a february 1988 
indictment accusing him of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin drug cartel to protect and facilitate their 
usbound cocaine shipments he is being held at the metropolitan 
correctional center outside miami

a former school administrator has 
confessed that he killed his exgirlfriend ending an 11yearold 
murder mystery 
francis malinosky 45 appeared in chittenden superior court 
monday and told a judge what police and the victims family had 
long suspected he killed schoolteacher judith leoconeys in 
november 1979 
i am ashamed of myself right down to the very center of my 
being malinosky said admitting his crime to district judge 
frank mahady 
as part of a plea bargain malinosky last week led police to 
leoconeys body which had never been found the corpse covered 
in plastic was located in a 2footdeep grave off a logging road 
in cabot 
an autopsy showed leoconeys had been shot 
in return for malinoskys cooperation the state reduced its 
charge against him from firstdegree murder to voluntary 
manslaughter the plea agreement called for a 10 to 15year prison 
sentence with all but five of those years suspended he could be 
released from prison as early as late 1993 
mahady weighed whether to accept or reject the plea agreement 
for more than an hour 
the penalty contemplated in the agreement simply doesnt fit 
the offense the judge said on returning to the bench 
but he said he accepted it because it accomplished important 
goals that could not have been accomplished in any other way it 
resolved what happened 11 years ago 
we settled for half a loaf but half a loaf is much much better 
than none said chittenden county states attorney william 
sorrell there was enough uncertainty about what might happen at 
the hands of a court or the hands of a jury that it made sense on 
both sides to try to reach an agreement 
malinosky was arrested in april in a los angelesarea motel 
where he had been staying under an alias he claimed then that he 
was the victim of a smalltown witch hunt 
malinosky was an assistant director of special education for the 
burlington schools and leoconeys was a milton special education 
teacher when their twoyear relationship ended in the summer of 
1979 the breakup reportedly left malinosky distraught his 
attorney said 
leoconeys 32 disappeared nov 5 1979 after going to 
malinoskys home to pick up her personal belongings 
malinosky had been a suspect from the beginning but police were 
never able to connect him with leoconeys disappearance police 
said several diggings around his house failed to uncover any 
evidence 
as the investigation accelerated malinosky disappeared in 
december and wandered the country using a host of aliases police 
said 
in 1989 sorrell took over as states attorney and after 
reading the case file for three days reopened the case 
i was convinced when i looked at the file that he had murdered 
her sorrell said it bothered me that this guy was getting 
away with murder

two minnesota brothers and their two 
soviet companions pedaled up to the state capitol monday to 
complete a 13000mile roundtheworld bicycle tour that began 
eight months earlier 
we couldnt be happier 30yearold dan buettner of 
minneapolis told family members supporters and reporters who 
turned out on a cold drizzly morning to welcome the team 
we went through a hurricane and earthquakes and floods and we 
had the salmonella sicknesses at times we didnt think we were 
going to make it and we knew a lot of folks back here were 
watching us and rooting for us and thats really what kind of kept 
us going 
his brother steve 25 of roseville said i feel fantastic 
this is the happiest day of my life 
the buettners and soviet bikers vladimir volodya kovalenko 
32 and alexander razumenko 31 began their journey april 1 
the foursomes goal was to circle the globe following as 
closely as possible the 45th parallel and to get credit in the 
guinness book of world records as the first people to cycle across 
the soviet union the trip took the four to novosibirsk siberia 
the soviet bikers hometown 
the 7353mile stretch across the soviet union took 125 days a 
spokesman for the team said guinness is going over the 
documentation to verify the record dan buettner already holds a 
guinness record for cycling from alaska to tierra del fuego 
buettner said the most challenging part of the trip was in the 
far eastern part of the soviet union 
the roads came to an end he said and we had about 800 
miles where we pushed our bicycles along footpaths and through the 
mud and kneedeep bogs when things got really bad we went up to 
the transsiberian railway and pushed our bikes along it that was 
probably the toughest part we were drinking water out of mud 
puddles and we were eating buckwheat and chinese pork fat 
physically the trip was not so difficult said razumenko 
although dan buettner disagreed 
its easy for alexander to say it wasnt so tough because hes 
been to antarctica and the north pole and for him bicycling is 
probably easy said buettner who lost 18 pounds during the 
journey 
the buettners met razumenko and kovalenko through a suburban 
minneapolis group called connect usussr which arranges 
visits and business transactions between the two countries the 
largest sponsor of the 30000 trip was 3m co of st paul raleigh 
bicycle corp of america donated the offtherack mountain

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki resigned 
monday along with his government a day after a political neophyte 
dealt him a humiliating defeat in presidential elections 
polands painful but necessary program of getting out of 
economic catastrophe can only be realized with the understanding of 
the majority of the nation said mazowiecki the first 
noncommunist prime minister in the east bloc society made its 
choice 
he had come in third in presidential elections sunday failing 
to qualify for a runoff with solidarity leader lech walesa who 
finished first 
mazowiecki was knocked out of the race by stanislaw tyminski a 
wealthy businessman who returned to poland this fall after 21 years 
in canada and peru 
i will win these elections an optimistic tyminski told 
supporters and the curious at his warsaw headquarters i am not 
afraid of walesa i am not afraid of anyone 
walesa said tyminskis success was an accelerated lesson in 
democracy 
mazowiecki 63 took office in august 1989 and spearheaded 
eastern europes most ambitious economic reforms and won 
international acclaim for his historic role in the democratization 
but the election results made clear his inability to head off 
discontent among ordinary poles particularly those in the 
countryside suffering through inflation unemployment and 
widespread uncertainty after four decades of communism 
the vision of creating a polish democracy and a healthy 
economy that my government served has been questioned mazowiecki 
said 
he told state radio he and his government could not be 
responsible for promises made by the other candidates 
mazowiecki announced he will submit his governments formal 
resignation to parliament the government will continue only in a 
caretaker role until a new one is formed following the dec 9 
runoff mazowiecki said 
it was the first time poles voted for a president by popular 
election in the past both under communist rule and before world 
war ii presidents were elected by the parliament 
news of mazowieckis resignation drew an angry reaction from 
walesa who had tapped him for the post of prime minister then 
split with him over the pace of reforms in the postcommunist era 
thats great responsibility walesa said sarcastically 
contacted at home by the associated press now let the poles see 
this responsibility this patriotism and this democracy of 
mazowiecki 
he later told state television that the resignation would be 
complicating things but he hoped calm will prevail and 
everything will end up well he added he would try to sew up 
solidarity 
tyminski 42 who was not taken seriously by other candidates 
until polls indicated a late surge of support promised to make 
poland prosperous and assailed the mazowiecki government as 
incompetent 
tyminskis promises of wealth were particularly alluring to 
voters worn down by economic reforms launched by mazowiecki 
with mazowieckis resignation a new prime minister presumably 
would be nominated to parliament by the new president 
both the mazowiecki and walesa camps expressed shock at 
tyminskis showing 
walesa at his solidarity union office in gdansk called 
tyminski an accident in polish democracy and said he was not 
a serious man 
with all 49 provinces reporting walesa had nearly 40 percent of 
the vote tyminski 23 percent and mazowiecki 18 percent three 
minor candidates split the rest according to election commission 
results collected by the official news agency pap turnout was put 
at 61 percent 
walesa the shipyard worker who marshaled the forces that ended 
communist rule had hoped for a huge mandate in sundays vote he 
had said earlier it would be horrible to face tyminski in the 
second round of balloting 
i must say i am hesitating he said monday but added one 
has to think over what is good for poland 
one newspaper commentator attributed tyminskis strong showing 
to support from a second poland of disaffected rural and 
smalltown voters who are looking for quick answers to their 
countrys difficulties 
the major candidates and the press underestimated their numbers 
piotr pacewicz wrote monday in the countrys largest newspaper 
gazeta wyborcza 
he said tyminski profited from being an outsider who came from 
the world of success from the americas and who was not a part of 
the world of politics 
tyminski was also the beneficiary of a split in solidarity 
which held together and battled communism for more than a decade 
but then broke into separate camps supporting and opposing walesa 
and differing over the pace of economic reforms 
there was no indication whether mazowiecki would throw his 
support to walesa or what his backers would decide mazoweicki 
vowed to continue the the struggle for a democracy as we want 
it but added i am afraid i expect a period of chaos 
the head of the fringe libertarian party of canada tyminski has 
sometimes puzzled reporters with odd statements he promised poles 
again on monday he would quickly cure their economic woes 
i want to make this country rich and prosperous he said 
it will be better within a month 
tyminski has said a routine business trip to warsaw in september 
turned into a campaign for the presidency he said he had been 
denied entry to poland in the 1980s 
i just want to help my country and i couldnt before he 
said 
the new president will take over from wojciech jaruzelski the 
communist general who ordered martial law to crush solidarity but 
now is retiring early to complete the democratic transformation 
the election was the first in eastern europe tofocus not on 
defeating communism but on choosing between visions for the 
postcommunist future 
the new president will serve a fiveyear term

the us air force launched a new 
more powerful delta rocket monday carrying a 65 million navstar 
navigation satellite that will help troops stay oriented in the 
saudi arabian desert 
the loss of wind data from a weather balloon caused a brief 
delay but at 439 pm the 45 million 128foot delta 2 
boosted by an improved main engine and nine new larger solid 
rockets strapped around its first stage core lifted off 
the 10th navstar satellite launched since february 1989 
separated from its booster 25 minutes after launch it is scheduled 
to reach its final 11000mile orbit above earth on wednesday 
the navstars allow us and allied troops inthe middle east to 
use telephonesized handheld receivers to determine their 
position within 35 feet in the nearly featureless desert of saudi 
arabia the troops were deployed to the persian gulf after iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
more than 1000 receivers produced for civilian use have been 
distributed to the troops in the persian gulf said lt gen thomas 
mooreman jr chief of the air force space command another 
thousand are on order

china said monday that washington had invited a 
chinese vice minister of trade to visit next month the report came 
days before a major vote on iraq by the un security council of 
which china is a permanent member 
a senior state department official insisted the united states 
had not changed its policy of barring highlevel exchanges with 
beijing a moratorium imposed after soldiers crushed the chinese 
democracy movement in june 1989 
the official speaking in washington on condition of not being 
identified said the ban precludes large formal ceremonial 
exchanges and that the visit of vice trade minister gu yongjiang 
does not fall into that category 
he said meetings have been held since june 1989 at the vice 
minister level and next months meeting is consistent with what 
has gone on before 
at un headquarters in new york china and the soviet union on 
monday joined america britain and france in agreeing on a un 
draft resolution authorizing use of military force unless iraq 
withdraws by january from kuwait which it invaded aug 2 
washington has pushed hard for such a resolution 
word of gus planned visit came as us embassy spokesman 
sheridan w bell announced that chinese foreign minister qian 
qichen will travel to new york to vote on that security council 
resolution 
bell said the beijing government notified the embassy of qians 
plans the foreign ministry here did not immediately respond when 
asked for confirmation 
as permanent council members the united states the soviet 
union china britain and france each has veto power over any 
resolution 
chinas longstanding policy is one of opposition to superpower 
intervention in regional issues china has pressed for a peaceful 
solution to the persian gulf crisis 
the beijing governments world standing has greatly improved 
following chinas support for resolutions against iraq prompting 
efforts by the bush administration to resume normal relations with 
china 
the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade said that 
vice minister gu will visit the united states from dec 1014 at 
the invitation of j michael farren commerce department 
undersecretary 
the only clearcut western sanction on china still in effect is 
a ban on arms sales

president bush saying usmexican 
relations have never been better met with mexican president 
carlos salinas de gortari on monday for talks the white house said 
focused on negotiating an end to trade barriers 
lets commence a new era for both our nations bush said 
addressing tens of thousands of people at an evening welcoming 
ceremony in a plaza in this industrial city in northern mexico 
bush was here for two days of talks 
viva mexico bush declared to cheers that filled the large 
plaza 
a prospective usmexican free trade agreement similar to one 
the united states negotiated with canada two years ago headed the 
agenda 
but the president also cited challenges in the world beyond 
our borders particularly reconstruction in central america and 
restoration of stability in the persian gulf region 
salinas has supported bushs persian gulf policy and has hinted 
he might send troops to fight along with us forces if the united 
nations agrees to a usbacked resolution authorizing force 
against iraq 
mexico has also increased its oil production to help offset oil 
lost from iraq and kuwait boosting its exports to the united 
states by 100000 barrels a day there are 42 gallons in each 
barrel 
ive come to mexico tonight with a message of respect and 
hope for a brighter future shared by our two countries bush 
said he called the ending of trade barriers vital to both nations 
i believe that usmexican relations have never been 
better bush said in his first official visit as president 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that at their first 
session the two leaders focused on the proposed free trade 
agreement 
both presidents are interested in pursuing the agreement as 
fast as possible and attach high priority to its successful 
conclusion fitzwater said 
he said bush and salinas also talked about increasing 
cooperation in the war against drugs and working more closely to 
end border violence 
bush and salinas discussed the situation in el salvador and 
agreed to press for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement to 
the situation fitzwater said 
despite warm greetings the two presidents paid one another 
salinas signalled difficult trade talks ahead accusing the united 
states of trade protectionism even before his guest arrived 
today american products can enter the mexican market without 
restriction he told the monterrey daily el norte but ours are 
detained at customs and there are always many restrictions 
bush got a redcarpet airport greeting then travelled with 
salinas by helicopter to salinas hometown of agualeguas a small 
farming and cattle community about 60 miles northeast of monterrey 
salinas took bush to a charro or rodeo where the two 
presidents were tieless while their wives wore light suits under a 
glaring sun 
they watched mexican dancers before walking through the packed 
streets of the town square to a luncheon and talks 
it was the sixth time bush and salinas have met since they were 
both elected in 1988 but bushs first trip to mexico as president 
salinas introducing bush at the rally hailed what he said was 
a new relationship between our countries as mexico assumes its 
new place in the world 
geography made us forced neighbors history made us wary 
neighbors may our will and vision of the future make us respectful 
and progressive neighborssalinas said 
mexico has changed faithful to its principles and traditions 
but looking to the future with liberty and sovereignty to become a 
modern competitive and just nation said salinas 
on tuesday the two were to meet for more talks and bush was to 
address a group of mexican business leaders in monterrey a 
manufacturing city of more than 3 million only 143 miles from 
laredo in texas bushs adopted homestate 
preliminary discussions on the freetrade pact have been under 
way since salinas visited washington in june bush notified 
congress in september of his plans to negotiate such an agreement 
possibly by 1992 
but even as the united states and mexico worked toward achieving 
such an accord trade frictions remained 
salinas has resisted bush administration suggestions that the 
staterun oil industry be opened up to us investment as part of 
the freetrade negotiations 
mexico also wants any free trade agreement to make it easer for 
mexicans to enter the united states 
in the newspaper interview salinas said he was concerned that 
protectionist attitudes in the united states were making it hard 
for mexico to ship agricultural products and fish 
mexican fruits and vegetables are periodically barred from the 
united states for not meeting quality standards restrictions that 
mexicans contend favor us growers and fishing interests 
a recent us ban on mexican tuna which environmentalists said 
was caught in nets that kill dolphins caused an outcry here the 
ban has since been overturned by a federal court

defending champion garry kasparov and his 
fellow soviet rival anatoly karpov adjourned their 14th game of the 
world chess championship on monday after both players encountered 
time troubles following five hours of play 
the rapidfire finish ended when kasparov sealed his 41st move 
both had three pawns a rook a queen and king left 
they also adjourned after saturdays 13th game which led to a 
draw kasparov and karpov each have 6 points 
they were tied at 6 after the first 12 games in new york 10 of 
which were draws between oct 8 and nov 7 
the first player to gain 12 points wins the championship and 
17 million of a 3 million purse in event of a tie kasparov 
retains the title 
mondays 14th game and second of the french phase of the 
championship started when kasparov walked on stage and sat behind 
the white pieces he thought a few minutes and moved the kings 
pawn 
karpov arrived and matched it by moving his kings pawn 
kasparov used an opening that karpov has seen before in 
toplevel competition known as the scotch game 
until the eighth move the game matched two contests that karpov 
played with black against dutch grandmaster jan timman in the 
mid1980s 
karpov won one game in 28 moves and drew the other after 57 so 
experts noted that he was acquainted with this line of play 
he played black at least seven times in major competition 
against the scotch opening winning three and drawing four 
but when kasparov moved a queens bishops pawn a new game 
developed 
after almost two hours and 17 moves of the game karpov already 
had an hour more in playing time than kasparov 
karpov used almost 20 minutes to decide his 18th move moving 
his queen in a position to apply some central pressure 
by now karpov had less than 48 minutes to do 22 moves each 
player is allotted 2 hours for his first 40 moves 
saturday in the 13th game karpov also ran into time trouble 
but got out of it with eight moves in seven minutes 
but on monday kasparov wasted away his time advantage on the 
19th move he thought for 53 minutes before he decided to move the 
queens knight 
on the 21st move karpov brought up a knight to add more 
pressure and grandmasters were saying that karpov could be 
threatening mate quite soon 
but kasparov battled back after being in check on the 23rd move 
after a flurry of exchanges karpov had just five minutes left 
for 14 moves but moved quickly to use just three minutes for six 
moves 
but kasparov was under pressure too and realized he had just 
eight minutes left after move 32 
from then on both players made moves in a series of rapid 
decisions that left them both flirting with the time limit after 
five hours 
karpov put kasparov into check three consecutive times but 
kasparov kept moving his king out of danger 
the two played almost exactly the fivehour limit for the first 
40 moves before kasparov sealed his 41st move 
experts again were divided on who had the better posiion 
another draw could be agreed upon before play resumes tuesday 
after saturdays adjournment karpov offered a draw sunday 
morning six hours before the restart

salman rushdie came out of hiding briefly monday 
to tape a television interview in which the author said he wants to 
put together bits of my life and talk to moslems about threats 
on his life the bbc reported 
rushdie has been in seclusion since february 1989 when the late 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered moslems to kill 
him for blaspheming islam in his book the satanic verses 
rushdie went to the bbcs lime grove studios in west london for 
an interview on the arts program the late show which was 
broadcast monday night the bbc said 
the bbc refused comment on why rushdie decided to go to the 
studio instead of being interviewed at a safe house as he has 
in the past 
i want to slowly begin to pinch back bits of my life and to 
continue to work as hard as i can to bring the temperature down 
he said 
that involves talking to moslem leaders to try and find a 
common ground and it seems to me there is a lot of common ground 
but the point is to make it more solid 
he again denied that the satanic verses was an incitement to 
religious hatred 
asked what he would like to be doing in a few months rushdie 
said i would like to spend it on a beach but i cant see it 
happening i am not looking too far ahead

patience and a quarter of the water denver uses 
in one day helped firefighters rein in a fire monday that burned 
more than 19 million gallons of jet fuel at a tank farm near 
stapleton international airport 
the strategy of the 150 firefighters was to let the fire that 
began sunda consume fuel in the ignited tanks and prevent it from 
spreading by drenching nearby tanks with water and foam 
we at this point in time feel like everything is under our 
grasp said denver fire department capt nick nuanes things 
are going real real good the intensity has dropped 
dramatically 
meanwhile the black smoke from the fire that darkened the sky 
and caused potential health problems was tracked with help from a 
crew of computer scientists at rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
the fire at the ogden allied services corp tank farm began when 
a valve on a 400000gallon storage tank broke and jet fuel began 
to leak the flames eventually spread to three other tanks 
the facility has 12 storage tanks with a capacity of 125 
million gallons of fuel they include the primary fuel source for 
united airlines which was forced on sunday to delay and cancel an 
undetermined number of its 186 flights into and out of denver 
but the carrier was nearly back on schedule monday after finding 
alternate fuel sources said joe hopkins a united spokesman in 
chicago 
the fire caused few problems for other airlines at stapleton 
because most had alternate sources of fuel on hand stapleton is 
the nations fourthbusiest airport in passenger volume 
by midday monday firefighters had used 15000 gallons of foam 
about 24 million gallons of water had been poured on the blaze 
about onefourth the water used in the city system on an average 
fall day 
temperatures near the fire reached 3500 degrees fahrenheit 
well beyond the melting point of iron 
by monday the fire that consumed fuel in two 400000 gallon 
capacity tanks left them blackened crumpled masses of metal 
but flames continued to burn in one tank containing about 
350000 gallons of fuel and in an 800000gallon tank officials 
said the latter held enough fuel to burn until about midday 
wednesday 
authorities decided to let the fuel burn rather than attempt to

the five permanent members of the security council agreed monday 
on a un draft resolution authorizing military force against iraq 
by january unless it quits kuwait mikhail s gorbachev warned iraq 
its aggression will be punished 
iraqi president saddam hussein said on monday a great number 
of iraqis were dying because un sanctions were depriving them of 
medicine the official iraqi news agency reported 
diplomatic sources discounted previous iraqi claims it was short 
of medicine medical shipments qualify as humanitarian aid not 
barred under the un trade embargo imposed to make iraq leave 
kuwait after its blitz invasion on aug 2 following disputes over 
oil land and money 
the draft agreed monday by the united states the soviet union 
china britain and france would be the 11th un resolution aimed 
at iraq since the persian gulf crisis began it would authorize 
all necesary means meaning military force unless iraq 
withdraws by jan 1 or jan 15 
a firm date will be decided before the 15member council votes 
this week diplomats said the measure is expected to be adopted at 
an extraordinary council session of foreign ministers 
as soviet president gorbachev pledged in an address to the 
supreme soviet parliament that the alliance against iraq would not 
be broken the bush administration called up combat reserve troops 
from four states 
oil prices jumped 2 a barrel amid speculation about war in the 
gulf 
saddam blamed the united states for the alleged shortage of 
medicine in his remarks to the relatives of three american hostages 
released in iraq on monday ina said monitored in cyprus 
saddam said no foreigners had died as a result of not being 
allowed to leave iraq the report said 
iraq has held hundreds of americans trapped by the kuwait 
invasion among other foreign hostages he said monday that in 
holding them we only intended to add factors that might make 
some of those who seek war hesitate a little to think better 
president bush and other leaders have said the hostages will not 
be a factor in deciding whether to attack iraq and called for 
their immediate release 
gorbachev and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met 
with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz in the kremlin to demand 
that iraq withdraw from kuwait 
answering questions from legislators in moscow gorbachev said 
the gulf crisis was a test of the new postcold war cooperation 
our position remains based on principles and it includes the 
following aggression is inadmissible it should be punished and 
the preaggression state should be restored gorbachev said 
he said saddam could not break the alliance assembled against 
iraq and that iraqs aggression could not be allowed to prevail 
because we are just moving away from the cold war when 
everything was decided from a position of force 
in the iraqi capital us and british diplomats said more than 
100 americans britons and europeans held in kuwait were brought 
overnight to a baghdad hotel the group included at least 10 
americans and 60 britons 
the diplomats said they were unsure if the new arrivals would be 
used to replace germans allowed to leave strategic sites in iraq or 
were being brought to baghdad to be released 
they also said iraq had not allowed any iraqis to enter kuwait 
for a week and had been urging those in the country to go home 
the swedish embassy said nearly 60 swedes the last remaining 
swedish citizens in iraq will be allowed to leave 
however the soviet union complained iraq reneged on a promise 
to free 1000 more soviet citizens this month 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said iraqs actions 
were totally abnormal and unacceptable the official soviet 
news agency tass said aziz attributed the soviets delayed 
departures to a bureaucratic accident 
dennis trundy of brockton mass said saddam told his wife in 
saddams meeting monday with relatives of hostages that her twin 
brother john stevenson would soon be allowed to go 
she and her two brothers met with saddam hussein sometime this 
morning and he said sure take him said trundy who spoke with 
his wife by telephone 
fred harrington of bellevue wash also apparently was among 
those promised freedom i believe im coming home harrington 
said in a telephone call to his wife najmi at the familys 
bellevue home

the soviet union and china joined the 
united states britain and france on monday in delivering an 
ultimatum that gives iraq until january to withdraw its troops from 
kuwait or face a military strike 
the nations the five permanent security council members with 
veto power agreed monday on a draft resolution that allows use of 
all necessary means to liberate kuwait and restore its 
government 
the draft contains optional deadline dates jan 1 or jan 15 
it gives iraq one last chance in a pause of goodwill 
the deadline in the final resolution to be adopted thursday 
will be decided in consultations among the 15 council members 
diplomats said 
mondays accord ends speculation the soviets and chinese might 
abstain previously the kremlin and beijing indicated only they 
would not veto the measure now a positive vote by the soviet union 
and china seems assured on the proposed resolution 
all five permament members voted on the 10 earlier resolutions 
passed against iraq 
the broad coalition against iraqs invasion of kuwait now has 
passed its toughest test authorization of military force 
the resolution demands that iraq withdraw and authorizes all 
necessary means meaning military force to drive iraqi 
invaders from kuwait but it decides to allow iraq one final 
opportunity as a pause of goodwill to leave the sheikdom it 
invaded aug 2 
the measure is expected to be adopted at an extraordinary 
session of foreign ministers it would mark the second time in un 
history the security council authorized military action to counter 
aggression the first was in 1950 during the korean conflict 
the council also authorized military action to enforce the 
maritime embargo of iraq and the blockade against rhodesia now 
blackruled zimbabwe in 1966 
british ambassador david hannay told reporters the january 
deadline whether the first or 15th is not a pause for good 
offices 
it is a pause in which we all are making clear that no new 
measures will be taken against iraq prior to the end of that 
period after which the authorization to use all measures which 
includes the use of force would become available he said 
the envoy said britain supports a jan 1 deadline because that 
would mean nearly six months that iraq has been in illegal 
occupation of kuwait and long enough to realize the world is united 
against it 
the united states also favors jan 1 but us officials in 
washington indicated the resolution and date were negotiable 
kuwait was preparing a presentation for the security council on 
tuesday including a videotape to portray what it describes as 
iraqi atrocities since the invasion including the murder of 
children and looting of hospitals 
soviet ambassador yuliy m vorontsov told reporters monday as he 
entered consultations there is broad agreement among the five 
he did not specify the deadline for iraqi troop withdrawal but 
western and other diplomats said the soviets favor more time for 
peace efforts 
the draft resolution would authorize member states cooperating 
with the government of kuwait unless iraq on or before jan 1 15 
1991 fully implements the foregoing resolutions calling for 
withdrawal to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the 
security council resolutions passed in response to iraqs invasion 
and occupation of kuwait and to restore international peace and 
security 
the resolution text obtained by the associated press says that 
despite all un efforts iraq refuses to comply with its 
obligation to heed un resolutions demanding withdrawal from 
kuwait in flagrant contempt of the council 
it cites chapter 7 of the un charter which authorizes use of 
military force to counter aggression if sanctions and other steps 
fail 
foreign diplomats said they expect the proposal to be amended 
before the vote this week noting some member states are against 
imposing a deadline for withdrawal of saddam husseins troops from 
kuwait 
judith kipper an associate at brookings institute a washington 
research group said it would be a mistake for the bush 
administration to try to set a deadline 
ms kipper who just returned from baghdad where she met the 
iraqi president said to put a date is to put his back to the 
wall and make things impossible if we go public its a guarantee 
that well have to go to war 
the united states has the nine votes needed to ensure passage 
and the vote is likely thursday or friday any permanent member 
could block the resolution but a veto is considered unlikely 
the united states consulted with the other four permanent 
members monday in an attempt to agree on final wording of the 
resolution informal talks also were held with the other council 
members 
us officials want to secure a resolution on use of force 
before turning the december presidency over to yemen which has 
favored iraq in the past 
other security council members at present are canada colombia 
cuba ethiopia finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen and 
zaire

iraqi president saddam hussein said 
monday that many iraqis were dying because united nations sanctions 
were depriving them of medicine the official iraqi news agency 
reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted him monday as telling 
relatives of three american hostages about to be freed that the 
united states in the forefront of the effort to push iraq out of 
kuwait was responsible for the deaths 
but do you know ladies and gentlemen how many children and 
people died as a result of the united states denying medicine to 
the people of iraq ina quoted him as saying 
go to the hospitals and ask them to supply us with lists we 
will find out what great number of people are dying as a result of 
being deprived of medicine 
diplomatic sources have discounted previous iraqi claims it was 
short of medicine foreign hospital staff leaving iraq have not 
reported any gaps in drugs although they said iraq lacked medical 
personnel in some specialized fields like pediatrics 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity noted that 
tons of medicine have been flown in weekly from european nations 
seeking hostage releases the latest large shipment was 25 tons 
from italy on saturday medical shipments qualify as humanitarian 
aid not barred under the un trade embargo 
kuwaiti officials have said they had a sixmonth stockpile of 
medicine for almost 2 million people in kuwait that iraq seized 
after its aug 2 invasion 
the diplomatic sources said iraq was claiming a shortage of 
medicine to stockpile supplies for the military in case the persian 
gulf confrontation erupts 
saddam said no foreigners died as a result of not being allowed 
to leave iraq ina reported 
he told the american families that iraqis were also unhappy that 
hundreds of foreigners were barred from leaving 
but our only excuse lies in the intention we do not intend to 
harm anybody or deny anybody his rights he said 
we only intended to add factors that might make some of those 
who seek war hesitate a little to think better 
president bush and other leaders have said the hostages will not 
be a factor in deciding whether to attack iraq and called for the 
immediate release of all hostages 
saddam repeated his call for peace by alluding to iraqs 198088 
war with iran 
we know very well what war means because we have been through 
it we also know that should this war take place it will be very 
horrifying both for humanity in general and for the interests of 
mankind he said

coma and accused him of shooting her and killing her boyfriend 
walked free monday after the second mistrial in his case 
george gurney won his freedom when a lone jurors dissent led to 
a mistrial it was the second hung jury in five months 
the rockingham county superior court jury had deliberated 14 
hours since early last week before telling judge douglas gray they 
were deadlocked with 11 votes to convict and one to acquit 
assistant attorney general michael ramsdell said 
prosecutors had decided not to seek a third trial if the jury 
couldnt reach a verdict 
miriam stoltzgurney 48 was found in woods near her windham 
home in february 1989 shot in the head and left for dead 
nearly five months passed before she regained consciousness but 
when she did come around stoltzgurney identified her exhusband 
as her assailant 
neither the jurors nor gurney 54 would speak to reporters 
defense lawyer albert scherr said gurney was relieved and felt 
good 
gurney of newburyport mass was a newspaper advertising 
salesman when he was arrested last year he had been behind bars 
ever since 
stoltzgurney told authorities that she and her boyfriend roger 
whittemore were surprised the night of the assault by a man 
wearing camouflage fatigues who burst into her home and beat 
stabbed and shot whittemore

jurors deliberated 19 hours and failed to reach a verdict half 
voted to convict him half to acquit him 
the testimony by stoltzgurney was all the prosecution had to 
put gurney at the scene 
the defense hammered at the reliability of her memory calling 
experts who testified that people with her kind of head injury 
sometimes create memories to fill in gaps in their actual recall

president najibullah of afghanistan 
said monday he has received proposals from the exiled king and 
moslem rebels that could help end the 12yearold civil war 
najibullah said the proposals from former king zahir shah and 
the mujahedeen guerrillas were made last week during his fourday 
trip to geneva he did not give details of the plans 
we talked with a number of opposition leaders and exchanged 
views for a political settlement the 43yearold president told 
a news conference in the afghan capital of kabul 
his remarks were broadcast later by state kabul radio on a 
program directed toward the more than 5 million afghan refugees 
living in neighboring iran and pakistan 
i can say that i am pleased and satisfied with the results of 
that meeting it could be the real foundation for future 
meetings he said 
the afghan president also said he stopped briefly in mashad 
iran en route to geneva for talks with government officials about 
nine guerrilla groups are headquartered in iran 
najibullah and his government have repeatedly claimed to have 
had contacts with the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors over 
the past two years however they have refused to disclose the 
names 
najibullah again on monday refused to give details of the 
meetings saying it could damage the peace process 
but guerrilla leaders based in pakistan have accused the kabul 
government of concocting stories about peace talks to try to 
undermine and further divide the resistance 
one guerrilla leader also accused the fundamentalist guerrillas 
of launching a smear campaign to link the more moderate leaders who 
favor the return of the former king with najibullah the 
fundamentalist have threatended to kill the former king if he 
returns from exile in rome 
at least two pakistani englishlanguage newspapers carried 
frontpage stories monday claiming the two most moderate guerrilla 
leaders had met this month with najibullah 
the muslim and the frontier post said pir sayed ahmed gailani 
leader of the national islamic front of afghanistan met najibullah 
in geneva and that sibghatullah mojaddidi leader of one of the 
smallest guerrilla groups met the afghan president earlier in 
iran 
both newspapers based their reports on afghan news agency run 
by fundamentalist leader gulbuddin hekmatyar and often criticized 
for its highly exaggerated reports and erroneous information 
nifa spokesman azim nasserzia denied reports it was 
physically nt possible he said 
for more than 12 years the guerrillas headquartered in pakistan 
have been fighting to topple successive communist governments in 
afghanistan 
after the soviet army intervened in afghanistan in 1979 
washington sent billions of dollars to the resistance 
pakistan has served as the conduit for ussupplied weapons 
but western diplomats said washington has little control over the 
allocation of arms it is widely known that hekmatyars 
hezbiislami or party of islam receives the lions share of 
weapons even though it is the most antiwestern of the seven 
guerrilla groups

decades of stubbornness paid off at 
least temporarily for doris gagnon monday when the state 
abandoned its effort to evict the 73yearold squatter from her 
makeshift beachfront home 
the state had until friday to evict gagnon from her compound of 
shacks and trailers in milford on long island sound so it could 
proceed with plans laid 19 years ago to build a park 
attorney general clarine nardi riddle said she wouldnt enforce 
the order because the the state department of environmental 
protection decided it didnt immediately need gagnons land 
for two decades gagnon refused to sell her house and half acre 
and stood fast when the state marshaled its legal forces against 
her 
on monday gagnon was as steadfast as ever she said shell 
never give up her sandy plot bordered on three sides by tall marsh 
grass nevermind that she has no electricity running water or 
telephone this is home with a family of cats dogs chickens 
geese and ducks 
they met somebody that wasnt afraid of them she said 
standing outside the combination chainlink and chickenwire fence 
that surrounds her property 
for 39 years i give it right back she said thank god 
with gods help ive been able to take it and ill take it until 
this case is over i wont give them the satisfaction of dying 
gagnons battle with the state began in the mid1960s when 
about 100 cottages in her neighborhood were torn down to make way 
for a state park 
she refused to sell the state seized her house and land under 
the right of eminent domain and her house was demolished in 1971 
gagnon was to get 15000 for her land she refused to take the 
money 
instead gagnon stayed as a squatter the state sought an 
eviction order in 1988 after milford health officials expressed 
concern about squalid conditions including bags of human waste 
piled behind her living quarters 
in her battle with the state gagnon argued she was never fairly 
compensated for her property and that she should receive an amount 
equal to its current market worth 
riddle also said she had been assured by milford health 
officials that sanitary problems cited in the original court action 
had improved 
there are times when circumstances change riddle said we

tamil rebel fighters are hunting down 
government soldiers who fled a beseiged military camp into the 
swampy jungles in northern sri lanka a guerrlla leader said 
monday 
the government statement said 150 soldiers were missing and more 
than 100 of them were feared dead it also claimed 196 rebels were 
killed in the clash before government troops retreated saturday 
the rebel militia said its fighters found 158 bodies of soldiers 
in the camp and 30 guerrillas were killed 
the reports could not be independently confirmed both sides are 
known to make exaggerated claims 
military officials said the troops made a tactical 
withdrawal after tamil forces stormed a military encampment in 
mankulam about 160 miles northeast of colombo 
we regard the capture of mankulam camp as a great victory a 
rebel leader sathasivam krishnakumar said in a telephone 
interview from london 
the fall of the camp is one of the worst setbacks suffered by 
the government since rebels resumed their separatist campaign in 
june this year 
in september the tiger rebels killed 60 soldiers when they 
overran the kokavil army camp 10 miles north of mankulam 
krishnakumar said at least 250 soldiers have fled into the 
jungles 
they have split into small groups or individuals and are lost 
our cadres are hunting them down he said 
the nearest military garrison is vavuniya 30 miles south of 
mankulam the troops will never make it there krishnakumar 
said 
the tamil guerrillas seek an independent nation claiming they 
are discriminated against by the sinhalese majority in jobs and 
education 
more than 14000 people have been killed since tamils started 
the separatist campaign in 1983 
tamils make up 18 percent of the islands 16 million people 
sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of sri lankas population 
control the government and military 
with the fall of mankulam the government now controls only five 
isolated military bases in the predominantly rebelcontrolled 
north 
president ranasinghe premadasa called an emergency government 
meeting monday to discuss the mankulam attack senior government 
officials said details of the meeting were not disclosed

just weeks before the scheduled restart of 
the first savannah river site reactor the energy department said 
monday it doesnt know when the plants three reactors will begin 
operations 
a top agency official monday also said the energy department 
might not need to restart all three reactors to continue meeting 
the nations needs for nuclear weapons materials 
deputy secretary henson moore said the savannah river reactors 
arent ready to be restarted because they still fail to meet energy 
department standards 
in an interview with the augusta chronicle moore refused to be 
specific about when the reactors might be restarted moore was in 
the augusta area monday to present a grant to the south carolina 
universities research and education foundation 
the reactors located in south carolina about 30 minutes east of 
augusta are the nations sole production source of plutonium and 
tritium two key elements in nuclear weapons tritium a 
radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear 
weapons decays at the rate of about 55 percent a year and must be 
replenished in warheads periodically 
all three reactors have been shut down since august 1988 for 
safety improvements in may energy secretary james watkins said 
the first reactor would be restarted in december or january and 
the other two reactors would restart by six months later 
nuclear experts including watkins previously have said that a 
delay in the timetable could result in a dismantling of some 
nuclear weapons because enough of the tritium in them would have 
decayed to render them useless 
but moore said monday such time pressure no longer exists 
the soviet union is changing and the pressure on us to have a 
certain amount of nuclear materials by a certain date is changing 
to where we are not under any bind in the foreseeable future 
moore said 
moore said the previously scheduled restart dates were simply an 
estimate by the department made at congress request he said the 
department never intended to restart the reactors until they met 
department standards 
our schedule has always been that when theyre ready they 
will operate our standards still havent been met and so 
therefore those reactors arent going to run moore said

cnn has turned over its tapes of manuel noriegas 
jailhouse phone calls so that a federal magistrate can help 
determine whether noriegas right to a fair trial has been 
jeopardized 
the network handed over a briefcase full of tapes nov 20 after 
the us supreme court refused to lift us district judge william 
hoevelers temporary order barring cnn from airing the recordings 
us magistrate william turnoff will make and study transcripts 
and report to hoeveler who will preside over noriegas trial on 
drug trafficking charges and will weigh a defense request to 
dismiss the case 
hoeveler assigned turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being 
tainted by having learned details of noriegas defense 
strategy 
no time limit for reviewing the tapes was set but noriegas 
lead attorney frank rubino said the judge guaranteed it would 
done with dispatch 
rubino also asked hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against cnn 
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judges 
order the judge did not immediately set a hearing saying he must 
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a 
cnn request to remove him from the tapes case 
cnn attorney steven korn wouldnt say how many tapes were turned 
over he would not discuss their contents or origins but said he 
was confident that the judge will rescind the order not to 
broadcast the tapes 
he said cnn believes it never violated the judges order because 
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by 
attorneyclient confidentiality in part because rubino tacitly 
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air 
noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because 
of the taping the freezing of his assets and other alleged 
government misconduct 
the fallen dictator is jailed near miami on charges of taking 
bribes to protect the cocaine trade his trial isnt expected to 
begin before the spring

despite a controversial projection about a 
massive midwest earthquake some residents along the new madrid 
fault are more worried about getting knocked down by a tv truck 
than a temblor in early december 
weve got reporters running out our ears new madrid police 
chief jim helms said theyve been here from washington 
michigan kansas city oklahoma and as far south as houston texas 
weve had them every day 
new madrid a town of about 3300 in southeastern missouri has 
become earthquake central for much of the media zeroing in on iben 
brownings projection and the accompanying anxiety in the region 
browning is a new mexico scientistbusiness consultant who says 
his research shows conditions will be right for a major earthquake 
along the new madrid fault about dec 23 he has projected a 5050 
chance 
he based his projections on tidal forces which will be 
particularly strong at that time most scientists discount his 
tidal theory but say that eventually there will be a powerful 
earthquake along the fault 
brownings projection nevertheless has led school officials in 
communities in at least four states to call off classes it also 
has renewed attention to earthquake preparedness in a region that 
experiences several hundred tremors a year that range from minor to 
imperceptible 
the new madrid fault zone runs roughly from marked tree in 
northeast arkansas across the missouri bootheel and up to near 
cairo in southern illinois 
since reports of brownings work came to light earlier this 
year the media have focused increasing attention on the new madrid 
zone 
television stations from throughout the region have done 
ratingsmonth series on the projection the fault zone and 
earthquake preparedness reporters have descended from detroit 
minneapolis baltimore and tampa fla people magazine and the 
television program unsolved mysteries also have been to town 
although new madrid residents have become used to being 
interviewed the town is bracing for monday dec 3 when the 
reporters photographers engineers and producers are expected back 
en masse helms said three blocks may be roped off to accommodate 
the television satellite trucks that will roll into town motel 
rooms have been snatched up 
maor dick phillips is understanding hell have to work as 
usual at phillips fertilizer co on dec 3 and then conduct a city 
council meeting that evening but hell also try to be available 
for interviews 
the situation raises questions for the media is the possibility 
of an earthquake discounted by most experts a story do you send 
a reporter just in case or do you ignore it and hope you dont 
miss what could be the regions biggest story of the year 
editors across the country are deciding 
were going mainly expecting nothing to happen said susan 
okie acting science editor at the washington post this is a 
story because of the excitement its generated 
the feeling is the same at the baltimore sun said national 
editor ed goodpaster 
its like any other prediction there are those that you 
really have to pay attention to to see whether anything does 
happen goodpaster said if it does happen youre in a good 
position to report on it and if it doesnt happen its a good 
story too

american teenagers in germany have 
launched a coverup mission for persian gulf soldiers yearning 
for reading material 
using marking pens and an eye for what may offend saudi 
sensibilities the teens have been drawing over pictures of

there was nothing left said us air force 2nd lt bryan 
stokstad who organized the magazine drive 
stokstad said he got the idea after reading an article in the 
unofficial military newspaper stars and stripes that the morale 
down there was just a little bit low because troops didnt have 
enough current publications 
they were receiving the stars and stripes but they were 
getting issues a week late and just for them to circulate around 
it would take even longer stockstad said nov 22 
since the project was started in midoctober the volunteers have 
sent out 2500 pounds of magazines to saudi arabia through the

the national newspaper tempo announced 
it was shutting down making it the ninth major victim of 
portugals collapsing press market 
the weekly closing the week of nov 26 was founded in 1975 as 
a conservative voice while much of the media swung to the left 
following a 1974 revolution that overthrew the countrys 
dictatorship 
the paper which had a circulation of 71000 in 1978 now sells 
about 17000 copies 
investors who hoped for advertising revenue in one of europes 
fastest growing economies fed a press boom in the 1980s but the 
market was unable to sustain the increasing number of papers in a 
country where almost 20 percent of the 103 million people are

with a shockingpink picture of tokyos skyline 
gracing its front page japans first newspaper designed for women 
lady kong hit the newsstands nov 26 with lots of fluff but 
little feminism 
as with virtually all enterprises here men run the daily 
tabloid leading some critics to complain that the publication is 
not likely to challenge the subservient role of women in japanese 
society 
everything even sanitary napkins has been planned and 
produced by men said harueko kato a communications professor at 
tokyo womens christian university and news coverage is not an 
exception 
the tabloids name refers to king kongs girlfriend the name 
apparently is meant to show that women are strong too 
kato believes the most important aspect of the new newspaper 
will be how the opinions of the female employees are reflected in 
hhe decisionmaking and news writing 
that will depend to a large extent on masahiro oshima the 
41yearold man who is the tabloids editorial director 
twentyseven of the 47 editors and reporters on his staff are 
women but they are in charge of only the entertainment and city 
guide sections 
the company specifically recruited male writers to work in the 
news department oshima explained to give news stories a serious 
tone 
despite the radical image the tabloid is cultivating with its 
odd name and advertisements suggesting greater independence for 
women there appears to be little emphasis on feminism and social 
issues 
the leading headline on the splashy front page was a call for 
tokyos commuter trains to extend operations a few hours each night 
to 2 am for the benefit of people who stay out late drinking and 
dancing 
the rest of the 80cent newspaper which describes itself in 
english as a newsy tabloid for tokyoites reads like a typical 
fashion magazine with a few pages of news slapped onto the front 
oshima said he had wanted to carry more features on social 
issues but a sixmonth marketing research program led him to 
reduce stories on politics business womens issues and the 
environment

despite new rules new taxes and a new scoring 
system all part of the fiveyear plan advertised as tough deficit 
control the federal debt numbers are about to get worse rising to 
record levels next year 
theyre supposed to get better later 
but the deal president bush called good medicine for the deficit 
problem is not a cure only a first dose 
that leaves both sides of the bargain with some explaining to do 
as the budget cycle begins again next winter 
congress and the white house both left the impression that their 
fiveyear budget agreement charts the way out of chronic deficits 
it took the better part of seven months and in the process 
according to budget director richard darman the political system 
seems to have exhausted even disgusted itself with its effort 
there is an ironic tendency to pretend that the deficit 
problem is over with and that it is time to change the subject 
darman said in a speech this month as a result there may be 
less political restraint on the generation of new ideas and 
initiatives 
while nobody said the problem was solved bush and democratic 
leaders said it had been tamed and political rhetoric obscured the 
fine print of red numbers to come 
its cut about 492 billion over five years off the deficit 
thats progress bush said shortly before the nov 6 elections 
and 350 billion of that was in spending cuts and we did put 
congress and this is the most important part of it on a 
payasyougo plan 
some of those reductions are based on a system of counting that 
bush had spent part of the campaign criticizing as 
insidethebeltway arithmetic in which reductions are figured 
against projected levels and so serve to limit future increases 
not to cut from actual past performance 
in his assessment on nov 16 darman said the fiveyear deal was 
a fair one with the toughest enforcement system ever on 
federal spending but he also said 
the deficit will in any case rise to record levels before 
turning down 
darman estimated the deficit for the current budget year will be 
between 250 and 300 billion when the books are closed next sept 
30 for the year just ended the deficit was 2204 billion just 
short of the record high of 1986 
there will be new almost certainly higher deficit projections 
in the budget bush is to send to congress by feb 4 
the new budget deal eliminates the system of annual deficit 
targets that were supposed to be enforced by automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts the targets are adjustable now 
depending on circumstances for the current budget year and the two 
to follow the new process sets limits in three categories 
domestic defense and foreign aid when spending exceeds the 
ceiling automatic spending cuts would be triggered on all the 
programs in that category 
that strengthens the administration hand in enforcing spending 
restraints because the office of management and budget will be 
keeping score and thus deciding when automatic cuts are warranted 
the new law also requires payasyougo measures to offset any 
tax reductions or increased entitlement spending programs 
it is an intricate process that comes with no guarantees 
with legally binding spending caps and the new payasyougo 
system we may be able to break free somewhat from the consume 
now promise to pay later approach darman said hedging his 
forecast 
it sounded simpler and surer in the shorthand of the campaign 
most americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the 
congress and between the branches over budget matters bush said 
before the final deal was fashioned it is high time we pulled 
together and got the job done right

the fall television season is 10 weeks old 
do you know where your favorite show is 
the sheer number of this seasons new programs is bad enough at 
30something and counting the four broadcast networks have made 
history by introducing the highest number of fall shows ever 
not to mention all the time changes and cancellations that 
accompany any new season in the resulting fallout you cant find 
a cherished show with a geiger counter 
lets start with monday 
turn to cbs at 8 pm to find the rotund star of uncle buck 
making his usual grossout jokes 
fat chance uncle buck has moved to fridays at 8 pm 
switching with evening shade the new creation of linda 
bloodworththomason and harry thomason executive producers of cbs 
hit series designing women 
at 10 pm face to face with connie chung made room for 
mommy after the star announced she was chucking her weekly series 
to aggressively pursue having a baby with maury povitch her 
tabloid tv journalist husband 
in place of face to face cbs put the trials of rosie 
oneill in which the terminally cranky title character played 
by sharon gless dumps her rich trappings but not her malibu home 
to become a public defender 
on tuesday abcs baby talk never made it to the delivery 
room after star connie sellecca left in a contractual dispute the 
comedy series spun from the hugely successful feature film look 
whos talking was rescheduled as a midseason replacement 
head of the class was put in the 830 pm slot with a new 
star to replace howard hesseman who quit the series about a high 
school honors class is rumored to be inches from the cancellation 
ax maybe it has something to do with the fact that in more than 
four years not one of those extrasmart kids has ever graduated 
still with us if the time changes seem confusing take a look 
at the title changes that accompany the plethora of new shows 
fox broadcasting cos dismally rated class of beverly hills 
became beverly hills 90210 perhaps fox thought including the 
zip code would make it easier for viewers to find 
the medical series signs of life on nbc became 
lifestories no matter the title the show needs cpr although 
a favorite of network entertainment president brandon tartikoff 
the lowrated program leaves its 8 pm sunday time slot next week 
nbc has said it will experiment with new times 
the networks hull st high became simply hull high 
before flunking out of prime time altogether 
cbs the hammersmiths became sons and daughters series 
star lucie arnaz said this summer that the former title sounded 
like a toe disease evidently the new name was not enough to 
ready the series for prime time more than two months into the fall 
schedule it has yet to premiere 
the widowed firefighter father and four alarm family became 
the family man but failed to burn up the ratings cbs 
announced last week that the show was going off the air dec 15 
on wednesday big bucks and a big name could not save cop 
rock the highly touted abc series by hill street blues 
creator steven bochco leaves the air dec 26 in its stead will be 
equal justice the densely populated law show that premiered as 
a replacement series last season 
cbs pulled lenny from its 8 pm time period moved doctor 
doctor to thursdays at 930 pm and put 48 hours in the 
onehour vacancy that resulted after a brief hiatus lenny 
returns to television dec 15 at 830 pm 
on thursday cbs moved its expensively produced superhero 
series the flash to 830 pm leaving nbcs the cosby show 
and foxs the simpsons to duke it out in the 8 pm slot 
on fridays fox killed dea its new series about the drug 
enforcement administration and moved against the law to fill 
the 9 pm void 
the standup comedian show comic strip live was introduced 
in against the laws old time period of 10 pm sunday 
the cbs saturday night schedule got a complete overhaul the 
hogan family moved from nbc to cbs this season on dec 15 it 
moves to oblivion when cbs yanks it in favor of lenny and 
jerks the family man in favor of a new series starring nell 
carter called you take the kids 
cbs earth force went six feet under early in the 
season broken badges a new series about cops on psychiatric 
leave took the leftover 9 pm slot last saturday the 10 pm 
period left by 48 hours now is occupied by wiseguy which 
also has been marked for cancellation 
the shuffling will continue after the holidays network 
officials begin gearing up for new midseason replacements

nasa the cando agency that could 
do no wrong during the early heady days of space exploration is 
now middleaged and suffering the consequences of having so stellar 
a past 
when we stub our toes that gets noticed and we get held 
against this very high standard says nasa administrator richard 
truly 
the national aeronautics and space administration has done more 
than stub its toes this year according to many observers its 
shot itself in the foot 
theyre the team that cant shoot straight says alex 
roland a former nasa historian who teaches history at duke 
university roland believes nasa can restore its former luster by 
sticking to missions that are certain to be accomplished 
the list of misses since summer is painfully long 
nasa failed to notice the hubble space telescopes flawed 
mirror until the 15 billion observatory was in orbit 
it grounded the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen leaks in two 
of three spaceships almost half a year went by without a launch 
the secondlongest grounding in shuttle history 
all that happened at the very worst time for us with congress 
coming up on the final deliberations on the budget truly says 
although nasa ended up with 138 billion 13 percent more than 
last years budget it was denied money for president bushs plan 
to send astronauts back to the moon and on to mars it also lost 
more than a halfbillion dollars for space station design work and 
was ordered by congress to come up with a more efficient plan by 
february for building the station 
certainly the biggest job weve got to do in the next few 
months is to get the space station program in sync with the budget 
realities says jr thompson nasas secondincommand 
gone are the moonstruck days of apollo in the late 1960s when 
nasas budget accounted for a record 385 percent of total federal 
spending and 34000 people worked for the agency this years space 
spending represents about 11 percent of the us budget and the 
work force totals some 24000 
weve probably lost some of the skills we need said james 
beggs who headed nasa from 1981 to 1986 we fill in with 
contractors theres nothing wrong with that except their 
motivation is not the same 
nasas most embarrassing accident this year involved employees 
of lockheed space operations co nasas prime contractor for 
shuttle processing the workers forgot to remove a 9footlong 
bright yellow beam from atlantis and it banged around the engine 
compartment as the orbiter was being hoisted into an upright 
position in october 
while truly admits nasa is more bureaucratic than it was during 
the apollo era he denies the quality of work is inferior to what 
existed during the mercury gemini and apollo programs that 
eventually put man on the moon critics repeatedly disagree 
you can sit inside the washington beltway and make those 
judgments all day long theyre just not factual thompson says 
we were up to our neck in problems in the apollo program 
thompson says citing numerous examples we were flying by the 
seat of our pants in a lot of those missions 
nevertheless nasa officials have started putting more emphasis 
on quality in fact its become a campaign 
the more i look at what can be done with the kinds of people 
we have and the more i look at the parts of nasa that i think have 
become more bureaucratic the way we push paper the way we write 
our memos the way we process our hardware theres hardly an area 
that cant be improved simply by reminding people that excellence 
goes into a product when you first make it truly says 
in trulys view the only real problem is that nasa is far 
more complex and far more broad than at any other time in its 
32year history 
it no longer has a simple single purpose truly says 
to help define nasas goals over the coming decade the white 
house last summer appointed the advisory committee on the future of 
the us space program the panel headed by martin marietta corp 
chairman norman augustine is expected to report its findings as 
early as december 
norman parmet chairman of nasas aerospace safety advisory 
panel is among those hoping to hear specifics he is a retired 
vice president of engineering for trans world airlines 
what i think is necessary is the top of this government mr 
bushs organization ought to establish not in general terms like 
were going to go to mars but whats the purpose of nasa spell it 
out and then make sure nasa adheres to the direction its given 
parmet says 
as it stands now nasas plans constantly change because of 
lack of government leadership and then government micromanages in 
the legislative area parmet says its not nasas fault its 
not congress fault its a combination of all of it its like 
chasing your own tail 
whats also necessary according to parmet is making nasas 
scattered field centers less selfserving and instead subservient 
to the whole the centers often compete against each other for 
highprofile projects and work sometimes is duplicated 
historian roland considers it silly to even be talking about 
going to the moon and mars given the current state of affairs 
financial and otherwise 
its not to say they arent legitimate longterm goals or 
perhaps there wont be some reason to go there roland says 
but theres no reason to race there as nasa wants to do 
the cold war is over the space war is over we have the 
freedom to design a rational program instead of a crash program to 
get to mars

much of nasas future depend on the shuttle which will mark its 
10th flying anniversary in april twentyfour missions were 
achieved before challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff on 
jan 28 1986 killing all seven aboard 
americans returned to space with discovery in september 1988 as 
of the end of november there have been 11 more flights with 
another the 38th shuttle mission set for early december 
nine missions were scheduled for 1990 the same number as in 
1985 the shuttle programs busiest year this years flight 
schedule was disrupted however by hydrogen leaks that crippled 
columbia and atlantis for months now six flights are expected 
the goal for 1991 is seven or eight shuttle flights roland is 
skeptical such a schedule can be kept given that nasas average 
since 1981 is four missions a year anything over that is 
optimistic he says 
many including roland question whether the shuttle is reliable 
enough to build the space station the shuttle program suffered a 
125 million budget cut this year which will reduce nasas 
flexibility to respond to mechanical problems said keith hudkins 
director of the shuttle obiter division 
its like anything else you just do the mandatory things and 
dont do a lot of the advance planning stuff he said 
although the new shuttle endeavour will expand the fleet to four 
once it starts flying in early 1992 columbia will be out of 
commission for nearly half a year nasa plans to send columbia to 
rockwell internationals shuttle assembly plant in palmdale 
calif in july for modifications the 175 million worth of work 
will extend columbias maximum stay in space from 10 to 16 days 
henry pohl director of engineering at johnson space center 
expects to see at least 10 shuttle flights a year by the mid1990s 
based on a fourship fleet he also anticipates eventually 
simultaneous flights 
we have a constraint right now where we want to look at the 
hardware before flying the next one pohl said how long do you 
have to do that 
each shuttle was designed for a 10year lifetime and 100 
flights or 10 trips a year discovery is the most traveled 
spaceship with 11 missions 
new technology is being developed for a national aerospace 
plane that would fly directly into orbit from a conventional 
runway pohl says such a craft is at least 20 years away and a 
fifth orbiter will be needed and a sixth and a seventh 
the reason for having so many shuttles pohl says is that if 
we fly long enough well lose every one of them 
people need to realize this is a dangerous business pohl 
says not many people think about it but when the orbiters in 
orbit its flying eight times faster than a bullet when it leaves 
the muzzle of a 30caliber rifle 
beggs says it would be tragic if the space program for whatever 
reason ground to a halt i dont believe the american people 
want that he says 
at a gut level most people recognize that the space program 
is like a great white fleet its a symbol of national prowess 
says joseph loftus assistant director for plans at johnson space 
center 
roland who believes nasa should reduce but not eliminate the 
amount spent on manned space predicts the space agencys continued 
existence will come into question ifor rather when there is 
another major setback 
but there are also some hard issues of who would do some of 
the things they do if they werent there roland says its 
hard to really see eliminating nasa 
despite all that anybody says if we dont do this space 
exploration were going to end up being a secondclass nation 
parmet says 
no matter what nasa achieves in the next few decades truly 
doubts it will generate the amount of fervor or pride that existed 
in america after the space race was declared in the wake of 
sputnik 
the apollo years were a magical time were not ever going to 
capture again in precisely the same way truly says when we go 
to mars some of that will be back even then it will probably be 
in reality more of an international endeavor 
you can only do first things once and that was a decade 
everything we were doing was a first

nasas dreams are alive but theyre 
in danger of fading fast 
the proposed space station freedom is reeling from a heavy 
budget blow so is the space exploration initiative president 
bushs plan for colonizing the moon early in the next century and 
sending astronauts to mars by 2019 
times are tougher than ever for the national aeronautics and 
space administration and theres no indication next year or the 
next will be any better 
congress in an unprecedented move has suggested that nasa cap 
its economic growth at 8 percent to 10 percent a year through the 
mid1990s nasa received 138 billion for fiscal 1991 124 
billion less than president bush wanted but still 16 billion more 
than last year 
weve got to get our appetite more in line with the budget 
thats the single biggest charge that weve got today says j r 
thompson nasas secondincommand 
we cannot keep aspiring to programs and growth in programs 
that are out of sync with the budget the more we do that the more 
problems we create for ourselves 
it also causes problems for nasas international partners most 
notably the european space agency the esa is collaborating with 
nasa on the 38 billion space station project as well as numerous 
other programs including the hubble space telescope and the solar 
probe ulysses 
we recognize were going to be faced with the vagaries of the 
annual appropriations process says ian pryke head of the esas 
washington office we dont like it but thats the way life 
is 
with the europeans help nasa is redesigning the space station 
to reflect this years cut of more than a halfbillion dollars and 
future budget constraints if there is not enough money to enable 
the station to be permanently manned then we ought to hang it 
up says william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
nasa still hopes to start building the station in 1995 but 
because of all the revising it wont be ready to permanently house 
astronauts until after 2000 years later than planned 
the space exploration initiative meanwhile remains more or 
less on hold congress refused to spend any money this year on the 
project bush had requested 37 million in startup funds 
one of nasas few projects that is running on time and below 
cost is the new space shuttle endeavour officials say thats 
because the 21 billion requested to build endeavour was awarded 
all at once instead of in yeartoyear installments and involved 
proven technology 
the biggest problem we have had is not what the budget is but 
the uncertainty as to what the budget will be says joseph loftus 
jr assistant director for plans at johnson space center in 
houston 
endeavour the fifth shuttle to be built is scheduled to arrive 
at kennedy space center in the spring its first flight will be in 
early 1992

some of them several times seven were killed one of four orbiters 
was destroyed 
here are some of the highlights of americas shuttle program 
april 12 1981 columbia blasts off on the first shuttle 
flight putting americans back in space after six years the 
mission lasted 54 hours 
nov 12 1981 columbia returns to space as the first reusable 
spaceship 
nov 11 1982 columbia carries two communications satellites 
into orbit the first time a manned spaceship has a commercial 
cargo 
june 18 1983 sally ride becomes the first american woman to 
fly in space 
aug 30 1983 guion bluford jr becomes the first black to fly 
in space 
nov 28 1983 the first nonastronauts go into space one of 
them the first foreigner launched in a us spaceship it is also 
the first spacelab mission 
feb 7 1984 bruce mccandless ii becomes the first person to 
fly free in space without being tethered to a craft two hours 
later robert stewart becomes the second 
april 10 1984 george nelson and james van hoften perform the 
first satellite repair in orbit replacing a failed control system 
and bad electronics box on the solar max spacecraft 
nov 8 1984 discovery lifts off on the first satellite 
retrieval mission two communications spacecraft are snared from 
orbit and returned to earth 
april 12 1985 the first politician us sen jake garn 
flies in space 
july 29 1985 one of challengers three main engines shuts 
down 5 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff forcing an 
aborttoorbit in which a shuttle is sent into a lower orbit than 
planned it is the first inflight engine cutoff 
nov 29 1985 the first construction work is performed in 
space jerry ross and sherwood spring assemble and disassemble a 
beam and pyramid to test techniques being developed for building a 
space station they perform a similar spacewalking demonstration 
two days later 
jan 28 1986 challenger explodes 73 seconds into flight 
killing all seven aboard it is americas second space tragedy the 
1967 apollo spacecraft fire which killed three was the first 
sept 29 1988 america returns to space as discovery blasts 
off with five astronauts 
may 4 1989 the first planetary probe venusbound magellan 
is launched from a shuttle 
april 25 1990 the hubble space telescope is deployed from 
discovery nasa calls the orbiting observatory the greatest advance 
in astronomy since galileos telescope 
may 29 1990 columbias countdown is halted six hours before 
liftoff when hydrogen fuel leaks from the shuttle 
june 29 1990 atlantis also is found to have hydrogen leaks 
and nasa temporarily grounds the entire fleet 
oct 6 1990 discovery lifts off with a sun probe ending a 
5month grounding that is the secondlongest in shuttle history

shopping mall patrons across the land are 
screaming the same question do the kids think they own the place 
well among those teenage hordes some in fact do kicking them 
out though has proved a dubious solution theres money in those 
jeans

with christmas shoppers breathing down their necks the people 
who run the nations almost 35000 shopping centers have an eye out 
these days for the droves of teenagers whose high jinks sometimes 
explode in violence and whose presence sometimes intimidates other 
shoppers 
about a dozen shopping centers and malls have gone so far as to 
ban teenagers entirely at critical hours 
and even those that havent are looking for ways to cope with 
youngsters who have adopted the comfortable and elegant mall 
surroundings as second homes 
at its fall meeting in kansas city the international council of 
shopping centers held a seminar titled hanging out whose 
shopping mall is it anyway 
at mckinley mall in hamburg ny 15 miles from buffalo no one 
under 20 is allowed inside between 6 and 10 pm on fridays and 
saturdays unless they are reporting for work or are accompanied by 
an adult 
the mall took the action after an estimated 600 teens inundated 
the malls food court one friday night and a fight in the parking 
lot spilled over into the common area 
at the randall park mall in north randall ohio the operators 
dont allow unescorted teens at any hour even teenagers going to 
the theater must be brought and picked up 
omahas park fair has banned people under 18 
beyond those shopping centers which have banned teens far more 
have reported trouble controlling teen crowds that clog common 
areas block store entrances and generally if inadvertently 
intimidate customers 
but banning teens has also posed an ironic conflict teens are 
good customers they spend a lot of money 
mall operators say the problems stem from changes in the 
community a growing number of twoincome latchkey families and the 
cuts made in school budgets leaving the teens no place to go when 
the closing bell rings they are a new kind of temporarily 
homeless and the mall is a haven 
the scene at aurora mall outside denver colo this christmas 
is a study in contrast to a year ago 
this year there are teenage advisory boards at all eight high 
schools in the malls neighborhood and each of these sends a 
representative to a super advisory board that meets once a month at 
the mall 
these youngsters with adult advisors drawn from the community 
help devise programs that can help revise adult perceptions about 
teenagers 
so this christmas they will field customer service ambassadors 
drawn from the high schools who will help adult customers with 
their parcels with directions to shops and try to change adult 
attitudes to the teenage presence there will also be teenagers 
available at the mall to wrap christmas presents for customers 
consider last year mall operators began to notice a growing 
number of youngsters in the spring of 1989 susan keene general 
manager says they were congregating in large groups acting out 
in loud fashion and otherwise horsing around we started 
receiving complaints from our adult shoppers on mondays following 
the weekends 
so in order to get rid of the problem and get rid of it fast 
we instituted a gettough policy in the fall of 1989 it was a kind 
of steamroller approach 
youngsters were handed walletsized cards with rules of behavior 
on them no behavior likely to cause a disturbance no sitting on 
planter walls no alcoholic beverages no blocking store entrances 
after two weeks notice they were given one warning and then 
photographed and banned recalcitrants were arrested by local 
police and charged with trespass 
the mall was banning 10 to 15 youngsters every saturday 
but it didnt work there was no decrease in teenagers coming 
to the mall harassment was not the answer furthermore the mall 
became the target of a boycott and pickets from the black 
community which perceived the tactic as being aimed at their 
children 
while only about 20 percent of aurora mall shoppers were 
africanamerican says manager keene about 75 percent of the 
kids who come to the mall are africanamerican 
clearly something else had to be done the mall began with a 
marketing survey intercepting youngsters and holding discussion 
groups to find out just who they were what they found was 
something of a surprise

the teens and their parents they discovered had a sense of 
ownership of the mall even though it was private property they 
felt it was their right to congregate there not just to shop the 
youngsters came to be with their friends to make dates to find 
out where the parties were all of this in lieu of a school 
environment which had suffered from budget cuts 
the mall offered an elegant and inexpensive focus for the 
youngsters and in some cases a place they perceived as being safer 
than their own neighborhoods the youngsters concerned about gang 
activity in the community saw the mall as safe haven 
stephen huber of a cleveland firm that manages a number of malls 
says that on one occasion three teen gang members were standing at 
an entrance to the mall when four members of a rival gang drove by 
the four turned the car around got a running start jumped the 
curb and crashed into the entrance in an attempt to run down their 
rivals 
oddly gang activity is easier to deal with than the teen 
problem shopping center operators say because the police know who 
they are and what to do about them 
not so the average teens the market survey showed that the 
teens visited the aurora mall one to three times a week visited an 
average of 10 stores and spent an average of 64 a visit most of 
them had sincere career aspirations and in spite of their bizarre 
dress and behavior were basically good kids 
so the mall operators set about changing their own mindset and 
that of security people just because kids had intimidating 
appearances and numbers it didnt mean they were bad or that they 
were any more bizarre than previous generations 
the mall also hired a customer service director whose job is 
more public relations than security which also comes under his 
purview the accent is on politeness requests to move on or 
please dont block the store front it seems to be working 
and the city of aurora put a highly visible police ministation 
in the heart of the mall 
there was a similar impasse at the columbia mall in columbia 
sc where a heavyhanded approach eventually yielded to gentler 
means without knowing it the mall operator had used a strong but 
old south carolina law that permits the banning of people from 
private property for six months under penalty of law 
they used the law frequently but then discovered it had been 
passed as a tool for segregationists there was a community uproar 
now the mall has a polite customer service corps neatly dressed 
people in blazers and carrying radios and directories of stores 
they help customers with parcels give directions and act as new 
sets of eyes and ears as they roam around the mall 
the emergence of the mall as a prime community focal point has 
been growing throughout the nation each year the number of malls 
and floor space has been growing about 7 percent a year drawing 
1724 million adults 70 percent of the population 
malls and shopping centers now number 34683 and more than 
1500 new ones were started in 1989 one near minneapolis plans to 
house about 600 stores 
so the teen problem can be expected to grow 
most expect teen banning to abate however teens are a growing 
56 billion market and this has not passed unnoticed 
bans quite naturally have alienated teens at the mckinley mall 
in hamburg 15yearold jan harris says a lot of kids who are 
here are straight the reason they turn away people is that theyre 
different she was banned from the mall when she sat on a bench 
to rest is that a valid reason to kick someone out she asked 
by and large mckinley merchants say the ban has not affected 
business as much as they feared 
ron jefferson who runs the singing river mall in gautier 
miss which attracts as many as 200 teens on a weekend has put in 
an outside entrance to the game rooms to divert traffic he has 
also put in extra security and more phones at the theaters on 
visits to local schools he reminds teens that they are potential 
mall employees as well as patrons 
malls have been havens for teenagers almost from the beginning 
in fact mall owners took pains to attract them with movie theaters 
game rooms record stores the difference today is their sheer 
numbers 
managers are trying innovations to attract teens one offers 
vacant space to a church group which has set up dropin 
counseling another features fashion shows with high school 
students as models 
says one manager when i was a kid i didnt have an american 
express card but these kids do they spend a lot of money here

the dalai lama remains an exile from the land he 
fled more than 30 years ago his fight to free his people from 
chinese sway continues a nobel peace prize winner his only weapon 
is persuasion but privately he wonders if there is any hope or 
whether there is any future for the role of a dalai lama 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there is something incongruous in the scene the 
dalai lama seated robed and crosslegged on a baby blue upholstered 
easy chair in the royal suite of torontos royal york hotel where 
reproductions of 18th century european paintings gather dust on the 
walls 
but then there is also something incongruous about a buddhist 
monk leading 6 million tibetans in a struggle for 
selfdetermination in their himalayan homeland using kindness as 
his only weapon against the ruling chinese 
he warmly grasps the hand of his interviewer in both of his 
smiling frequently laughing he makes selfdeprecating jokes or 
tells humorous stories of his childhood 
obligatorily he speaks about chinese politics and violations of 
human rights in the land he fled in 1959 after an abortive 
uprising a land tibetans say is an independent country under 
occupation and beijing says is an integral part of china 
but his eyes light up his whole being comes alive when the 
subjet changes to peace to kindness to human nature to a world 
without violence 
some of the restless youths who live at his headquarters in 
exile at dharmsala india sometimes grow impatient with his 
methods 
i always tell them my reasons he says softly sipping tea 
firstly violence is against human nature then secondly 
through violence although you may achieve something you may solve 
some problem violence always creates a second problem it may be 
useful but the side effect is immense then in our case if we 
follow a more violent nature we may lose many good supporters 
peace 
what that means depends very much on your definition of the 
word says the winner of the 1989 nobel peace prize on one level 
peace may be simply the absence of violence on another he says 
after considerable reflection it is the absence of fear 
since the second world war during the cold war there has 
been some kind of peace says the maroon and saffronrobed monk 
warming to his subject but that peace was not a genuine peace 
that peace was something like the mere absence of war bascially 
that kind of peace comes from fear 
now today i think peace is a genuine peace without fear 
genuine in the sense of cooperation or the sense of some kind of 
security and working together thats not the mere absence of war 
thats much more positive much more conceptive 
now that kind of peace i have always believed comes 
through mental peace so first peace must be created here in our 
minds he says tapping the sparse short bristles on his head 
then as a reflection of that inner peace peace atmosphere in the 
family peace atmosphere in the community in the country and on an 
international level 
the dalai lama was born lhamo dhondrub on july 6 1935 in a 
small village in northeastern tibet at the age of 2 he was in 
accordance with tradition found by a search party of monks and 
after a series of tests recognized as the reincarnation of his 
predecessor the 13th dalai lama he was renamed jetsun jamphel 
ngawang lobsang yeshe tenzin gyatso holy lord gentle glory 
eloquent compassionate learned defender of the faith ocean of 
wisdom

in 1950 the chinese communists attacked and occupied tibet 
forcing the young dalai lama to step forward and attempt to deal 
with peking nine years later he fled over the mountains on a yak 
to india setting up in exile 
much to the dismay of many of his followers he is not convinced 
the dalai lama an institution created 600 years ago has much of a 
future 
some people get the impression that the dalai lama institution 
is an essential element of buddhism it is not he says leaning 
forward peering seriously through his tinted glasses buddhism 
flourished in tibet much earlier than the dalai lama institution 
and also some people get the idea that the dalai lama is something 
of a symbol for tibet and without the dalai lama tibet no longer 
exists or something that is foolish 
he says that he is just a buddhist monk although he readily 
admits that he is a unifying force for tibetans 
but this does not mean that the institution should always 
remain it entirely depends on the wishes of the tibetan people if 
they feel the institution should be kept then it will remain if 
the majority of the people feel it doesnt matter then the 
institution will cease in that case i will be the last dalai 
lama 
such talk makes many of his followers nervous he laughs at 
their nervousness 
over 10 years between 1978 and 1988 there were a series of 
communications between the dalai lama and the authorities in 
beijing but according to the tibetan leader they were only 
interested in his return they said he could come back to tibet 
with all previous rights and privileges 
i told them that this is not the case the problem is 6 
million people its their rights and their culture and unless 
that basic problem is solved the question of my return is 
meaningless 
the chinese it seems have an important sensory organ missing 
he says with a belly laugh that echoes across the large sitting 
room of the hotel suite 
that is the ear they always lecture us always lecture 
lecture lecture they never listen to our viewpoint i think the 
world community now has to help with some aesthetic surgery to give 
them some new ears he says rocking back again with laughter 
his peace proposals first made public in 1987 and refined in 
1988 call for less than total independence for tibet leaving 
defense and foreign affairs to the chinese and all other matters in 
tibetan hands it also would allow a limited number of chinese 
troops in tibet a regional peace conference then a zone of 
peace with complete demilitarization 
were still awaiting a response 
much of tibets culture already has been destroyed by the 
chinese says the dalai lama and official policy is to dilute 
tibet in a sea of chinese immigration time he says is running 
out 
if the present situation remains another 15 years then there 
is no hope then tibetans become a very insignificant community in 
their own land 
nonetheless he is persistently optimistic the beijing regime 
is very old he theorizes and its only a matter of time younger 
more reasonable chinese leaders are on the way 
the younger generation of chinese they themselves are 
fighting for their rights for their democracy for their 
freedom 
but hed rather talk about love and compassion 
i am always trying to promote compassion and good heart he 
says the glow returning to his face not as a religious ideal 
but rather as a humanitarian idea i believe that little children 
are born free of any religion free of any ideology but not free 
of compassion so i believe that compassion and love is the basic 
human quality 
hatred is also a human quality but not the dominant one the 
dominant force in my mind is compassion

the building of tomorrow that frank lloyd 
wright built 69 years ago has survived the worst of man and nature 
but the great architects legacy may meet its match in tokyos land 
fever 
marked by the horizontal planes and simple wood and mortar of 
wrights prairie style the school sits cracked and leaking on 
a green square of land encroached by highrises and construction 
cranes in one of tokyos busie sections 
the approximately 3000 squareyard plot owned by jiyu gakuen 
or freedom school is worth at least 230 million dollars 
according to the schools president gyo hani 
that may prove to be an offer the school cant refuse 
the controversy over myonichikan or building of tomorrow 
points up more than just the dominance of assets over aesthetics in 
tokyos constantly changing skyline where few traditional 
structures remain since the firebombing of world war ii 
architectural landmarks are rare and legal protections weak in a 
nation with a habit of rebuilding itself from fires earthquakes 
and war 
in japan says prof hiroyuki suzuki of tokyo university 
artistry bows to function generally speaking japanese love new 
buildings 
wright himself the father of organic architecture preached 
that the building should be a natural circumstance of the land 
but the fields and farmhouses amid which he built myonichikan in 
1921 are no longer there today the building is used as a center 
for craftmaking and other activities 
hani insists there is no plan to sell but says financial 
security is his first priority as head of jiyu gakuen now a 
25acre campus about 10 miles north 
hanis cousin yuko hani is seeking to raise the estimated 2 
million needed to save myonichikan both are related to the 
schools founders 
if japan is a great economic power why doesnt it spend money 
on preserving these cultural assets said yuko hani in that 
sense we certainly cant call ourselves a civilized nation can 
we 
wright who died in 1959 designed the building while in tokyo 
to supervise the construction of his imperial hotel which was 
later razed along with a private home near osaka myonichikan is 
the only wright building left in japan 
edwin reischauer the former us ambassador to japan who died 
this year wrote that myonichikan symbolized japans search in 
the 1920s to become a liberal innovative nation and a free 
democratic society 
gyo hani says symbols are nice but with 230 million in land 
underneath we dont want to commit our posterity to giving up 
important assets

building prisons is a booming business these 
days as the nations prison population swells but take a look at 
what modern prisons look like inside and out they are taking on 
the appearance of office buildings and new designs cut in half the 
number of guards needed to supervise them

the bakermiller shade of pink was supposed to 
have a calming effect on inmates it did but not for long 
it worked for about 15 minutes said ann balazs resident 
color expert at l robert kimball amp associates a pennsylvania 
design firm after that they went nuts 
picking a wall paint may seem a trifle but in the growing field 
of prison design its often the little things that count 
like where to put the exterior plateglass windows now used to 
let in more natural light in rural settings waisthigh windows 
work fine not so in urban areas where inmates temptation to moon 
passersby proves irresistible 
the ebensburg pa firm founded by mrs balazs father has 
learned that lesson and countless others after 12 years designing 
more than 30 correctional facilities from federal prisons to 
county jails executives say revenues have risen from 12 million 
to 26 million in the last five years and theres no sign of a 
slowdown 
thats because the countrys inmate population continues to 
grow the number of people behind bars has ballooned from about 
500000 just 10 years ago to nearly 11 million according to the 
bureau of justice statistics and the national council on crime and 
delinquency predicts the figure could reach 2 million by 1995 
prisons and jails built today are a far cry from the ones 
pictured in old edward g robinson movies gone are the drab 
corridors painted in government green or hospital white designers 
are experimenting with blues yellows and earth tones to soften the 
look bakermiller pink failed to make the grade because 
researchers found its soothing effect only temporary given that 
quality mrs balazs said its ideal for holding pens 
to make prisons and jails more livable designers have included 
such features as air conditioning upholstery and carpeting 
stainlesssteel toilets once used because they were all but 
impossible to rip from the floor are giving way to ceramic 
fixtures some of them with seats 
wardens often hold out such amenities as a carrot to inmates who 
want to graduate to better living quarters within a facility 
even the exteriors have a different look the bars barbed wire 
and blockhouse style of older facilities made them easy to 
recognize modern prisons and jails are built to blend in with the 
surrounding area 
l robert kimballs newest jail the hillsborough county 
correctional facility in manchester nh looks more like an 
office complex complete with landscaping other facilities have 
skylights columns or floortoceiling windows 
architects and wardens alike stress common sense rather than 
aesthetics is prompting the changes the overall design strategy 
aims at reducing tensions and forestalling trouble 
you used to have 100 inmates in a cellblock that was dark and 
filthy and not fit to be lived in that created a very volatile 
situation said kevin drinan hillsboroughs director of 
corrections 
drinan contends better living conditions make for better 
inmates 
generally speaking when you treat people like animals they 
act like animals he said 
critics complain the softer style has scant effect on hardened 
criminals if anything they fear it sends the wrong message 
if prisons are cushy places no one will mind going there 
contends edwin delattre who teaches applied ethics at boston 
university and recently wrote character and cops 
the purpose of prisons is to punish its unjust if they are 
too comfortable he said 
like other modern jails hillsborough is designed according to 
the directsupervision model approved by the national institute of 
corrections the building is divided into selfcontained areas that 
usually house 48 to 56 inmates the inmates sleep shower and dine 
in those areas whose cells are arranged around a large day room 
in the old days you used to take the inmates to the services 
now you take the services to the inmates said czaba balazs l 
robert kimballs chief architect and soninlaw to the firms 
founder and president 
because directsupervision prisons require more space balazs 
says they cost 10 percent to 15 percent more than traditional 
facilities but he contends they are less expensive in the long run 
because their layout limits the movement of inmates and therefore 
reduces by half the number of guards needed 
proponents of the directsupervision models say safety is 
another factor because inmates are always within view of their 
guards there are fewer fights according to a study by the 
national institute of corrections and the safer the environment 
the less likely inmates will resort to vandalism or violence in the 
hope of being separated from others 
moreover guards in directsupervision facilities are assigned 
to the same areas and encouraged to work closely with inmates so 
they can identify problems before they get out of hand 
a great part of it depends on the ability of the corrections 
officer not to be a tough guy but to be a good communicator said 
hillsboroughs drinan in many cases all these inmates need is 
someone wholl listen to them 
that handson approach combined with design changes can be an 
effective defense against trouble including uprisings and riots 
balazs said 
the environment can have a direct impact on the level of 
stress its no different than you or i getting irritated because 
of working conditions but at least we have options he said 
its viewed as coddling inmates but its really not the 
point is if you make it too tough on them theyre going to make 
it tough on you

in flawless english edward woodward combines 
bluster bluff and brilliance while he cons his way to finding 
killers in his new cbs series over my dead body 
woodwards character maxwell beckett is often pompous but also 
a touch nervous that the fraud about his actual scotland yard 
background will be discovered but he continues the charade in 
hopes that getting entwined in murder mysteries will revive the 
inspiration of his writing career 
woodward previously spent four years in new york for the 
equalizer a series that won him a devoted following it inspired 
the publication of a number of newsletters and turned woodward now 
60 and whitehaired into an unlikely sex symbol 
thank god my wife has a sense of humor he says me too 
i thought it started as a bit of fun then it got picked up by the 
magazines i must say it caused a great deal of mirth among my 
friends in england 
the new mysterycomedy is on friday nights prior to dallas 
in the cbs lineup woodward has his character fully defined 
maxwell pretends that he was a scotland yard detective but 
actually he was in the criminal analysis department its a lie he 
has to live with when we meet him hes moved to america running 
out of mystery plots and in the middle of a messy divorce 
hes irascible shortfused inclined to be pompous and 
feeling guilty about conning people but he does have a talent for 
analyzing crime and what makes people tick he has a terrible 
writers block and it makes him a very prickly individual 
on the set woodwards becket is trying to intimidate a woman 
into giving him information about a murder but hes halted in the 
middle of his bullying by jessica lundy his costar 
woodward and lundy are odd associates far apart in age but 
wellmatched in using each other in hopes of advancing their 
separate careers she has the role of nikki page a newspaper 
obituary writer he hopes shell bring him fresh material and she 
sees him as her ticket to the big time 
over my dead body brings the british actor to los angeles 
for his first dramatic work here he won an emmy in september as 
hostnarrator of the documentary series remembering world war 
ii 
he says there are no similarities between maxwell beckett of 
over my dead body and robert mccall of the equalizer 
maxwell is a physical coward he says in every way hes 
different except that he does have a good analytical mind 
woodward suffered a heart attack three years ago and was 
reluctant to appear in another onehour television series 
i didnt want to do another series i found the work 
unbelievably hard he says 
but he consented to do over my dead body because the series 
would bring him home to england in two years 
ive slowed down considerably he says i dont work 
between shows 
the main problem is that i have a 7yearold daughter who was 
in preschool in new york school in england and now los angeles 
its a great experience for a child to move around but when she 
turns 9 i want her to have a consistent education 
woodward negotiated a contract that the show will move to 
england after the first two tv seasons that will allow his 
daughter emily beth to attend school there while he and his 
wife michele dotrice move back into their home in cornwall he 
has three grown children by a previous marriage 
if were successful and move to great britain ill twist arms 
to shoot in cornwall but well probably stay around london the 
story will be that maxwell moves back home and nikki follows 
woodward also keeps a home in london where he was born 
we were bombed three times he says my father was 
convinced hitler was personally looking for him he was injured the 
last time and when he got out of the hospital we were evacuated to 
cornwall i learned to love boating there a month before we came 
here i bought a 42foot twinscrew motor yacht to cruise the coast 
france and the channel islands 
during his break between the equalizer and his new series 
woodward stayed busy playing sherlock holmes in england and making 
mr johnson in africa 
the movie mr johnson is due out in january like two of his 
other films breaker morant and king david it was directed 
by bruce beresford 
the title character is a 17yearold african he says im 
sgt gollup who runs a shop in nigeria in 1926 mr johnson is his 
clerk he was left behind by the british empire and retires in 
nigeria hes a most astonishing bigot he thinks hes a great 
gentleman to the african 
while in school woodward had planned to become a journalist 
but participation in a series of college productions changed his 
mind he studied at the royal academy of dramatic arts he made his 
stage debut in london then joined the royal shakespeare theatre 
co in stratfordonavon he also performed shakespeare on tours of 
india australia south africa and the soviet union 
the russians know the plays but its interesting to watch the 
audience hearing shakespeare in its native tongue for the first 
time shakespeare is played quite differently in russia we had 
three americans in the company and they were absolutely mobbed by 
the audience they were starved for contact with americans we 
brits said the americans and the russians were alike they each 
have a passion for their country love outdoor pursuits and have an 
enormous involvement with the arts

the most delectable movie of the holiday season 
is a simple little confection from john hughes about a 10yearold 
whos left behind by accident when his parents and multitude of 
siblings head off for a christmas vacation in paris 
home alone is endearing engaging and a lot of fun once you 
suspend disbelief and buy into hughes idiotic premise and one 
main reason for the films success is macaulay culkin the talented 
young actor who plays kevin the boy who finds paradise in being at 
home by himself and who gets to defend the castle against all 
intruders 
childcentered movies are popular with the younger set because 
they appeal to a sense of adventure wonderment and just plain 
getting away from grownups they also find an audience in those 
adults who are still fortunate enough to have a streak of whimsy in 
their lives 
some young actors put in such grand performances that the 
academy of motion picture arts and sciences honored them with oscar 
nominations only one tatum oneal ever won as supporting actress 
in paper moon in 1973 she was 10

vol 3 wilbury traveling wilburys 
 
the music worlds a big joke to the traveling wilburys whose 
new disc only sounds like it was written and recorded in an 
afternoon dont be fooled pride being what it is this lowkey 
supergroup has made a firstrate followup to their surprise 1988 
hit 
for all the winkwink nudgenudge antics the wilburys are 
quite serious when it comes to music in fact with the exception 
of tom petty whose solo career is still at its peak it might 
behoove george harrison bob dylan and jeff lynne to become 
fulltime wilburys 
that would allow dylan and harrison to indulge their senses of 
humor without worrying about their considerable recorded legacies 
harrison manages to fit the cliche twister shes got a body for 
business and a head for sin into the garage rocker shes my 
baby dylan gets the racy line she likes to stick her tongue 
right down my throat into the same song 
the wilburys dont credit songwriters individually but its 
clear dylans contributions loom large seemingly offhand songs 
such as if you belonged to me and the doowop style seven 
deadly sins are better than anything on his most recent solo 
album 
harrisons instrumental work is superb particularly his rocking 
sitar on the environmentalist the devils been busy and the 
warped guitar sound on pettys country romp poorhouse 
lynne as his recent solo album inadvertently proved is better 
suited now as a role player he plays the widest variety of 
instruments and his production with harrison despite the 
occasional annoying chirpy background vocals is fine 
you took my breath away is a worthy tribute to late wilbury 
roy orbison and the hilarious wilbury twist a dance anthem for 
cynical baby boomers brings this disc to a rocking close 
the wilburys sound like they may be suited to this business and 
thats no joke

uptown telarc andre previn with mundell lowe and ray 
brown 
 
great musicians moving into waters that are not really their 
element often produce tepid ripples of mediocrity 
composerconductor andre previn can adeptly put pen to musical 
score and ably draw the beauty of mozart out of a symphony 
orchestra with the wave of a baton but can he swing can he play 
to the grayness of an autumn day and the melancholy mood of 
stormy weather 
better to ask where previns talents stop for the answer to the 
above is yes 
previn on piano mundell lowe on guitar and ray brown on bass 
form as fine a straightahead jazz trio as any in recent memory 
most of the songs on uptown are by harold arlen or duke 
ellington and this trio gets to the essence of the music 
any trio has to have a solid backbeat to drive the sound and 
brown is the launch pad for previn and lowe his backing is so 
solid that both have the freedom to wander as moved they never 
wander too far afield however and that gives this record a 
friendly feel the mood is bright playful previn to lowe and 
back the solos flow 
lowes caress is soft but his sound is full previn is right on 
target with the mood of each song quick to jump on it dont mean 
a thing if you aint got that swing or five oclock whistle 
and slow to ponder on stormy weather or come sunday 
this is the second telarc jazz recording with previn the first 
featured brown and guitarist joe pass theres little doubt previn 
will ever need to make a living at jazz but this accomplished 
musician definitely has a home uptown

gerard depardieu is late he walks quickly into 
the hotel lobby apologizes for the delay and hurries off to make a 
phone call and ditch his suit 
a few minutes later the french actor is seated in a nearly 
empty restaurant wearing clothes more to his liking jeans 
tshirt and a denim windbreaker all black his sneakers are 
white 
depardieu is 6foot2 heavy in the torso and light on his feet 
like a dancing bear he has a mustache and straight darkblond 
hair that sweeps across his forehead his eyes are childlike 
sensitive and his nose is thick though no match for the one he 
wears in the title role of his new film cyrano de bergerac 
an adaptation of edmond rostands classic love story cyrano 
begins at a french theater in 1640 here too depardieu as 
cyrano is late the play has already started when a voice is heard 
shouting king of clowns leave the stage at once 
cyrano emerges pushing his way through the crowd his long hair 
and great nose unmistakable he shouts down the hapless actor on 
stage and shuts down the performance 
ive had dreams like that bad dreams laughs depardieu 
speaking mostly in english but keeping a translator on hand i 
always dream that i am on the stage and iforget my lines and i 
start sweeping the floors i like characters who go too far in 
cyrano what he does is very strong this man stops the play and 
puts the character in the street thats extraordinaire 
encroyable 
depardieu was born in 1948 in chateaureux part of the region of 
central france known as the berri the third of six children he 
was a petty thief at age 8 a dropout at 12 and a runaway at 13 a 
pyschologist urged him to take drama classes his first movie came 
out in 1965 his second six years later 
more than 60 have followed the breakthrough film called 
fittingly going places les valseuses 
nothing has changed insists depardieu who lives near paris 
with his wife and two children when i was 12 years old 8 years 
old i was exactly the same way as now i was always functioning 
very fast 
i always wanted to be an actor i loved the movies i went to 
the cinema when i was young and it was magic i loved going into 
the theater and sitting in the dark i would see french b movies 
also american movies 
his life on screen has been varied an imposter in le retour 
de martin guerre the return of martin guerre a bisexual 
thief in menage a hunchback in jean de florette an evil 
traveling salesman in nathalie granger he was guillotined in 
danton murdered in barocco and emasculated in la 
derniere femme the last woman 
awards for best actor include the cesar the french equivalent 
to the academy award in 1981 for le dernier metro the last 
metro a citation from the national society of film critics in 
1984 for danton and martin guerre and honors at the cannes 
film festival last summer for cyrano 
im not interested in people who are happy and everything is 
great someone who smiles and is an idiot who thinks everythings 
beautiful depardieu explains stretching his mouth into a 
mocksilly grin the most difficult thing is to play a man who is 
not a gangster or a romantic who is nothing 
his voice is a breathless purr at his most intimate moments it 
is highpitched and excitable when hes making a point and a 
hoarse bellow whew hes passionate 
depardieu loves everything about films except sitting still and 
cyrano mighty with the pen and sword is a man in motion talking 
and fighting pouring his heart out to the beautiful roxane but 
putting the words in the mouth of another man 
when i was young i was very introverted depardieu says 
i didnt need to wear masks i was a mask i was very good at 
training to be a boxer but as soon as the competition began id 
lose my nerve that didnt happen on stage 
the way cyrano speaks is magic i wish i could speak in verse 
like he does all the words he says came directly from the soul 
when youre transported by love youre in a state of grace it was 
an easy part to play because i believed in the words of cyrano 
depardieu prepares to leave making a telephone call and going 
through a quick photo session when he says goodbye one large hand 
grips tightly while the three inside fingers from his other hand 
rest gently above the wrist its a bond a mark until next time 
you want to roll up your sleeve and check for imprints 
i carry my adornments on my soul cyrano says i do not 
dress up like a popinjay but inwardly i keep my daintiness the 
actor speaks of his character as a tornado a man in love with 
melodrama who expends his energy and feelings without a second 
thought 
im quite like him in this respect depardieu notes 
and then he turns and rushes off headed for his next 
appointment trying not to be late

when seattle opera general director speight 
jenkins decided to produce antonin dvoraks rusalka he knew 
whom he wanted as lighting and set designer gunther 
schneidersiemssen 
there was just one hitch 
he said i wont come unless i am the director jenkins 
said 
saying yes meant giving schneidersiemssen what is normally the 
work of three people in his us debut as an opera stage director 
for 27 years he was the chief lighting and set designer for the 
late berlin philharmonic conductor herbert von karajan his seven 
production designs for der ring des niebelungen were the most 
by anyone since richard wagner compleeed the fourpart operatic 
extravaganza in 1874 
yet his only directing had been in the relative obscurity of 
south africa 
it was a gamble a total shot in the dark with one of the 
most famous people in the business jenkins said 
the gamble paid off in a shimmering joint production by the 
seattle opera and houston grand opera which is expected to present 
rusalka in its next season seattle performances were oct 
27nov 7 
unlike the movie based on the same hans christian andersen fairy 
tale the little mermaid the opera ends with the death of the 
prince and the confinement of rusalka to the dark marshes because 
she has been tainted by contact with humans 
on the one hand i want to bring out the characters and on 
the other hand i want to bring out the symbolic and the 
metaphysical traits schneidersiemssen said 
for example the chorus in rusalka represents a decadent 
party in the castle the one has parkinsons disease the other is 
limping a third has a pain in the back 
the princess and the dukes and rusalka are human creatures in 
contrast to the stiff party 
slides handpainted by schneidersiemssen were projected to form 
the princes castle which loomed forebodingly over a stone bridge 
and moat and the sky over rusalkas lake lined by trees that seem 
to filter an ethereal moonlight and luminescent sunshine 
spotlights shining through vertical plastic sheets gave the effect 
of rippling water 
schneidersiemssen said his goal was always that when the 
curtain opens you dont only hear the music you see the music 
giving music a visible dimension became his lifes work at age 
14 he said 
unable to decide between scenery painting and conducting he 
went to clemens krauss then general director of the state opera in 
vienna 
he said dont become a conductor in the future we need 
designers who are able to interpret music optically 
schneidersiemssen recalled 
during world war ii he studied scenic painting theater and 
related subjects at munich his first set design was for a small 
comedy called angelica for budget reasons he borrowed the 
furniture from the parlor of his parents apartment which soon 
afterward was bombed in an allied raid 
i saved that furniture from the american bombs he said 
when my parents went to opening night and the curtain opened 
they were shocked to see their living room on stage 
in his first stage contract at the landes theater in salzburg 
money shortages in warravaged europe led him to begin his 
pioneering use of slides to meld lighting into the set 
in 1956 working in bremen germany he learned that von karajan 
had admired his work on a production of beethovens fidelio 
a year and a half later schneidersiemssen arranged an 
introduction to von karajan in salzburg but it was only in 1962 
that their long collaboration began 
that year after laboring over a design proposal for pelleas 
et melisande he went to vienna and found the stage hands were on 
strike leaving too little time for set construction 
so i said to karajan you know lets not do all this lets 
do it all with light and projections 
that gave him the time to do the show schneidersiemssen 
said this was one of the most beautiful productions of 
karajan 
schneidersiemssens first stint as a director was on tristan 
und isolde in cape town south africa in 1983 he later directed 
the flying dutchman in 1985 die zauberflote in 1985 and 
fidelio this year at cape town durban pretoria and 
bloemfontein 
of course the fidelio and the concept of freedom has very 
much meaning in south africa he said i have in the opera 
house no apartheid i have black people and white people in the 
stage crew lighting and chorus 
today negotiating for contracts in austria and germany he said 
he probably should have begun directing 15 years ago 
i take certain works that are very much of interest to me and 
that are everything he said i was so busy with the research 
for the stage and the lighting i just didnt have the time 
he spends about seven months a year with his wife an american 
and their four children in a vienna home where he has his design 
studio two months at a summer home in salzburg for the annual 
musical festival and much of the rest of the time at an apartment 
in new york 
i fear i have a double marriage he said with stage 
design and with my wife

daryl hall and john oates those enduring 
peddlers of blueeyed soul have given up sex and dancing in favor 
of sweetness and sincerity 
on their new album anyway 
change of season on the arista label is a rebellion 
against the 1980s and all the decade symbolized the two said in an 
interview in their managers office 
the 80s were hightech and high flying gogo years of 
getting out there and being aggressive i thought it was time for a 
little more sweetness and coming together bringing out our 
sensitive side hall said 
ooh yeah the duos last album in 1988 was about late 
80s kind of things sex and dancing this is the opposite of 
that he said 
the new album is about change and how people react to change 
the unifying lyrical focus is the idea that change occurs and how 
people react to it resist it go with it 
i dont look back i just go hall said i move straight 
through things not without some difficulties occasionally 
i look forward to change said oates i see things moving 
whether they move forward or backward 
accompanying the softer image is a softer sound 
we did a series of unplugged acoustic shows last spring 
hall said you can play good rock n roll on mandolins it felt 
so good we decided to expand on it theyll probably do some of 
the set acoustically in their upcoming tour the final track on 
change of season is the acoustic so close unplugged 
despite the duos newly sweet image the tour will included a 
lot of that tainted 80s stuff sra smile rich girl 
private eyes maneater kiss on my list and i cant 
go for that the tour will begin in europe but hall and oates 
expect to spend most of next year performing in the united states 
in concerts this year theyve been performing cant help 
falling in love with you which they did on the last temptation 
of elvis an album of elvis presley hits performed by various 
artists to benefit the nordoff robbins music therapy trust 
most of change of season was recorded in a studio hall and 
oates built in upstate new york its equal distance between our 
two homes an hour and a half north of new york city said oates 
who is married and has no children hall has a longtime girlfriend 
its the first time in over a decade we havent recorded in 
new york city hall says thats another factor in the music 
it is not about urban subjects and the sound is not urban its a 
big change for us 
we didnt try for any one audience with this we were writing 
from inside 
the first single to be released off the new album is so 
close produced by danny kortchmar and jon bon jovi in los 
angeles 
george green sent me some lyrics hall said i adopted the 
moral and changed the words around a bit its about people who 
started wrong and stay wrong its not a pretty story 
hall and oates have been playing for nearly two decades their 
first album came out in 1972 the first they produced themselves 
was 1980s voices 
that album is the standard we judge ourselves from hall 
said its similar to this album in its purity and simplicity 
none of the songs on change of season is written by hall and 
oates together our apartness is part of our togetherness hall 
said we do solo projects or bring in other writers 
we have telepathic communication we can do different things 
and be apart like we were in 1986 and come back and have taken 
the same steps and really be thinking the same way 
i think in the process of making music we both kind of know 
right and wrong for us said oates

t coraghessan boyle was between acts just 
finished with an appearance on late night with david letterman 
and getting ready for a reading at columbia university 
a born performer he fit right in on letterman telling jokes 
about his middle name crocodiles in georgia and unsavory food in 
japan the host played it straight and let his guest steal the 
show 
letterman isnt known for trading barbs with men of letters 
imagine oneliners with john updike about rabbit at rest or 
gabriel garcia marquez on one hundred years of solitude so how 
did boyle end up sitting beside him 
his appearance is one reason boyle doesnt look like a writer 
he stands 6foot3 his skinny frame covered by a dark gray suit 
with white speckles and anchored by red hightop sneakers he has 
kinky hair the color of bruised apricots and a matching beard 
and the cover boy of the new york times book review section 
doesnt act like a writer certainly not the kind who spends hours 
brooding about the future of minimalist novels or the crisis of 
middleclass relationships in the late 20th century 
just call him in the letterman spirit the worlds most 
dangerous author 
i came up from nowhere looking at tv all day long and 
thinking writers were snobs boyle explained in an interview at 
manhattans algonquin hotel where brooding authors are known to 
congregate but i have the credentials i have the phd i have 
books on the front page of the new york times 
i think some writers who dont have the credentials have to 
prove themselves by acting stuffy maybe ive been lucky ive 
never been part of the club and i never will and i have no problem 
with that 
seven books and the penfaulkner prize for fiction in 1988 have 
settled him only slightly boyle is a hard man to pin down hes a 
fabulist a personality the slippery i in a hurricane of 
literary adventures 
read his short stories if the river was whisky and greasy 
lake or his new novel east is east viking 1995 and 
youll find apes chefs musicians and the wife of nikita 
khrushchev the author is distinctly off the pages 
none of the characters in east is east is based on people he 
knows hes never lived in any of the locations the plot came from 
a newspaper article he lost long ago 
what does t coraghessan boyle recovered addict of the small 
screen and other vices have to do with this wacky tale of hiro the 
japanese sailor who jumps ship along the coast of georgia and 
dodges immigration officials in the okefenokee swamp 
my joke is i wrote a novel about georgia because i had flown 
over georgia several times on my way to miami its easier to write 
the book if youve seen the place but i dont have to go there like 
james michener and dig in i think fiction is supposed to be an 
exercise of the imagination my take is i can do anything i want 
he was born 42 years ago his idea of nowhere the town of 
peekskill ny the childhood setting for the author and his 
television set the transformation from tom boyle couch potato and 
daydreamer to author t coraghessan boyle the middle name an 
early work of fiction began at a creative writing class in 
college 
boyle calls himself a virgin to writers colonies but he 
did spend five years at a den of iniquity known as the iowa writers 
workshop where kurt vonnegut john irving flannery oconnor and 
many others came of age 
boyle expresses his feelings about the company of his peers in 
east is east which features a colony swarming with pesky 
authors 
 
at breakfast it was thought artists of a certain temperament 
required an absolute and meditative silence broken only perhaps by 
the discreet tap of a demitasse spoon on the rim of a saucer in 
order to make a fruitful transition from the realm of dreams to 
that exalted state in which the deep stuff of aesthetic response 
rises to the surface 
others of course needed just the opposite conviviality 
uproar crippling gossip lame jokes and a whiff of the sour 
morning breath of their fellow artists to settle brains fevered 
by dreams of grandeur conquest and utter annihiliation of their 
enemies 
 
of course i was olympian and far above all that pettiness 
boyle speaking of his days at iowa said with a laugh i know 
how it feels and i think thats where im getting some of my 
inspiration i didnt do any politicking and i got everything i 
wanted from pure virtue like mahatma gandhi 
descent of man a collection of stories written for his phd 
at iowa was published in 1979 he followed that with more stories 
greasy lake and a pair of novels budding prospects and 
water music the historical novel worlds end set in the 
new york town of peterskill won him the penfaulkner award 
for the columbia reading boyle keeps the sneakers and dons a 
snappy black jacket this audience will have read his books but 
for the author its still a performance boyle sees himself as a 
crossover artist straddling talk shows and the ivy league 
i do believe the way everything is constructed with television 
and personality writers have to go out and grab hold of the 
attention in some way boyle said 
i think i wonder where i fit in exactly but as far as being 
on the front page of the new york times and also be on david 
letterman i have no problems with that i think in this society 
you have to try to catch and recapture the audience for literature 
thats a lot of energy spent for things outside of writing and 
thats bad

alison krauss chose music over roller 
derby and the result is a young bluegrass fiddlersinger 
shouldering her way into a maledominated genre 
the 19yearold krauss is one of just a few women recording the 
acoustic mountainbred music shes spent three years recording 
with rounder records and has already made a concert tour of the 
middle east 
but it wasnt that long ago a few years in fact that she had 
to choose between bowing her fiddle or racing on roller skates 
i was really into roller skating for a long time krauss 
recalled in an interview in the office of her booking agent i 
used to go every frday and saturday night i couldnt decide 
whether to play the violin or roller skate 
she chose violin and subsequently emerged as an independent and 
gifted instrumentalist with a soprano voice reminiscent of a young 
dolly parton or emmylou harris 
though still a teenager she has firm views about bluegrass 
music and what she will and wont do compromises arent likely 
although she has a recording contract with an independent label 
shes not ready to jump to a more prestigious major company 
we want to play bluegrass music and if somebody signed us it 
would be totally something else she said major labels today do 
not sign bluegrass performers because the commercial market for 
them is weak 
they would hire a producer and id want to be able to choose 
somebody myself krauss said 
maybe ill change my mind later but really thats not 
something im after right now im playing with four great people 
her band union station and i want to keep doing that 
she also refuses to play such bluegrass standards as orange 
blossom special rocky top and fox on the run 
our goal is to play our own music she said havent 
people heard those songs enough yet 
some bluegrass fans might consider such a statement blasphemy 
festival performers are routinely asked to play the standards made 
famous by bill monroe the osborne brothers and others 
krauss grew up in champaign ill and learned classical violin 
at age 5 she gravitated to bluegrass music and started winning 
bluegrass fiddle contests at age 12 before she was a teenager 
she began playing at bluegrass festivals in the midwest 
her current album is ive got that old feeling her third 
which contains songs focusing on romance and heartbreak her past 
lps were two highways in 1989 and too late to cry in 1987 
since she was 10 she has spent much time performing in clubs 
places where she was not old enough to legally drink liquor 
one time when i was about 13 i was told to go into a room on 
the break and told to stay there and not even see the bar she 
said nobody has ever gotten really rowdy sometimes somebody 
will get really sloshed at the end of the show but not often 
late last year she and her band spent a month in the middle 
east as part of a cultural exchange program sponsored by the us 
information agency she gave concerts in israel jordan pakistan 
syria and tunisia 
our music went over great she said it was a major moment 
in our lives we got to see places most people only think about 
she believes women are breaking into the bluegrass field which 
has never had a woman as an established star theres beginning 
to be singers fiddlers banjo players and allfemale bands 
bluegrass has been totally maledominated its just something 
women didnt do 
she said shes heard other women bluegrass musicians complain 
about being unwelcome by their male counterparts but ive never 
had that feeling that people didnt want me there because i was a 
woman 
her band a banjo player guitarist mandolin player and bass 
player performs mostly at nightclubs and some folk festivals 
the most exciting thing for me is to see people singing the 
words to your songs while you stand on the stage she said and 
when people request songs that you do and no one else does

karen meredith has a message for all the 
baby boomers whose parents told them to buy sensible cars save 
money and live within their means grow up mom and dad were right 
meredith an accountant inspired to action by the woes of her 
30something clients believes much of a generatiilt fourroom cottage 
that fits 
in the back yard 
developer j robert gillette says the cottages are americas 
answer to australias granny flats 
the cottages which can be hooked to untilities in the main 
home sell for about 50000 or rent for 600 to 700 a month the 
relatives are nearby but not crowding the family 
gillette wants the first cottages to be built on the grounds of 
senior citizens complexes cottage occupants will have more 
privacy and pay less than residents of the complex itself but 
still have easy access to social events meals and services such as 
laundry 
trial programs in pennsylvania new jersey texas and california 
show that what the american association of retired people calls the 
elder cottage housing opportunity an work 
its very cozy pauline wessner 85 said from the echo 
cottage shes lived in for two years near belvedere nj 
wessners grandson thought of her when the countys office on 
aging announced an echo trial program he had bought the house 
where she lived for nearly 40 years and she had moved to an 
apartment she said it was too much work for me to mow the grass 
and everything else 
i live right next door to my grandson now about 45 feet from 
his house she said 
the county bought the cottage and leases it to her for an amount 
based on her social security income she has a bedroom bathroom 
parlor and fully equipped kitchen 
probably not more than 100 of the little houses have been set up 
nationally said leah dobkin of the aarp in washington but the 
aarp has published outlines for developers and local governments of 
the zoning parking and other issues the cottages raise 
its better than backing a trailer in dobkin said these are 
specially designed for the elderly and they meet all housing 
codes she said 
gillettes cottage plans show ramps for people who dont want to 
climb stairs wide doors bathtub rails and kitchen sinks minus 
the usual cabinets underneath that keep wheelchair users at arms 
length 
gillette said hell erect four cottages at the american house 
dearborn heights mich complex by spring 
that the cottages are detached is a key for senior citizens like 
wessner who want to live near their families but not in the same 
house 
that wouldnt go wessner said they have two teenagers 
who like loud music grandmas a little too old for that now 
but the cottage avoids the loneliness of longdistance living 
my grandson stops in every morning with the newspaper for me 
they invite me over which i appreciate i go over there on sunday 
for coffee and a bun 
and on holidays she said we eat together unless im invited 
somewhere else

the old values from a time when 
neighbors cared about one another and youngsters respected their 
elders must be resurrected or the future will hold little hope for 
elderly indians an advocate says 
curtis cook executive director of the albuquerquebased 
national indian council on aging inc said the growing ranks of 
indian elderly make that philosophy even more crucial 
were in the midst of an increase in elders and decreasing 
resources cook said in a recent luncheon speech to the national 
congress of american indians convention something has to 
change 
the 199o census is expected to show an 83 percent increase in 
the population of indian elders since the last count taken a decade 
ago he said 
theres no way that the 90s can have any kind of new 
federalism or any kind of hope for the future of american indian 
elders unless the teachings and ways of the past are learned and 
practiced cook said 
cook a nonindian who has worked with american indians for more 
than 25 years urged changes in laws and policies and pressed for a 
commitment among governments and youth to serve older people 
cook criticized the indian health service and the us 
department of housing and urban development for what he called 
policies that hurt elderly indians 
he said hud will not build homes for indians over 62 and in 
some cases will allow only the nuclear family not grandparents 
to live in houses built with federal money 
that effectively abolished housing for indian elderly at a time 
when statistics show that 236 percent live at substandard levels 
he said 
cook said the ihs has no specialized geriatric care or research 
he criticized the social security system for eliminating 17000 
field contact positions in rural areas and the us bureau of 
indian affairs for not establishing special programs for the 
elderly 
this great american society which prides itself on feeding the 
needy throughout the world needs to learn a few things from 
indian society which would say we will not have enough but you 
are a guest here at this table and we will share cook said 
this is the indian term this is the indian way 
cook said after his talk that society generally holds a 
misconception that indians have all their needs met by the federal 
government he said indians and especially the elderly have the 
highest rates of poverty of any ethnic group in the country 
the ncai is the oldest and largest indian political organization 
in the united states

bob watts has flown military cargo planes 
to china and an orchestra to canada hes survived an emergency 
landing in bismarck and an unexpected plunge into the missouri 
river 
hes ornery or kind depending on whom you talk to 
watts 73 owns capital aviation with 10 small airplanes and 
runs it with his wife lois 
when hes not in the air you can find watts in his shop 
rebuilding a 1946 cessna along with his family lois their 
15yearold dog klondike and two cats 
klondike has logged more than 3000 miles in the air the cats 
midway and nuisance have made a few flights by sneaking on board 
watts has flown supplies to the garrison dam and to an 
earthquake scene in west yellowstone when conductor guy lombardo 
and his orchestra found their plane had engine trouble watts got 
them to canada 
ill bet ive got shirts and socks in at least a dozen 
laundromats all over the country from living out of a briefcase 
he says but hes had fun 
i wouldnt want an airline job where i have to fly to 
minneapolis to bismarck and back to minneapolis and back to 
bismarck i wouldnt do that for all the tea in china he says 
watts was in china during world war ii airlifting military 
supplies over the hump in the himalaya mountains to the flying 
tigers a group of mercenaries under the command of the united 
states and its allies 
on occasion we had redball alerts and we had to go on radio 
silence he says but the only thing we could really do was 
head for the clouds and there were plenty of those you just keep 
flying 
we hauled tent stakes ketchup light bulbs munitions we 
moved two cutup locomotives over the hump later they were welded 
back together 
after the war he and his brother jack started capital aviation 
corp jack watts retired eight years ago lois watts a home 
economics teacher for 29 years became office manager and 
bookkeeper in 1976 
in 1982 watts was piloting a plane carrying eight people when 
the landing gear failed and he was forced to bring the plane down 
in bismarck on its belly the landing was smooth no one was hurt 
in 1956 he and a photographer escaped injury when their light 
plane went into the missouri river 
i wasnt watching where i was going watts recalls i just 
flew the plane into the water just like the guy on the street 
turns his head to look at a pretty girl and hits a lamppost i 
learned to mind the road 
his biggest obstacle he says is the federal aviation 
administration which is threatening to take away his license for 
flying without the proper fuel adjustment valve watts and his 
attorney are fighting the agency 
if you dont dot all your is and cross your ts you are 
subject to severe penalties and fines watt says people in 
washington seem to think a light plane is a rich mans fancy 
but people like erwin kobs of bismarck who did maintenance for 
watts in the 1950s think hell outlast the bureaucrats 
hes a tough master kobs said but hes a good pilot 
aviation is his life theres no doubt about that hes a 
survivor

superior taste is the main reason for homegrown 
vegetables but identical varieties will ripen around the same time 
unless the planting is spaced over several weeks so successive 
plantings are needed for a continuous topquality supply over the 
longest possible period 
for example in this warm arid climate green onions for eating 
scallions develop from onion sets in a few weeks in late october 
or early november i prepare a 4by10foot raised bed and divide 
it into three equal segments sets spaced an inch apart are planted 
in the first segment two weeks later a similar planting goes into 
segment no 2 segment no 3 is planted two weeks later 
by the time the green onions from the first bed have been eaten 
and replacement sets planted the second bed is being harvested 
this sequence continues until higher temperatures rule out onion 
planting usually in late february then i put in a warmseason 
crop such as green peppers using the same timing 
planting times vary with climates and vegetables of course and 
the process can be this simple or more complex as desired 
to determine plantsuccession timing its necessary to determine 
the days needed for maturing there are general guidelines for each 
vegetable 
beets usually take 60 to 80 days cauliflower 90 to 100 days 
carrots 60 to 100 days eggplant 70 to 120 days peppers 90 to 120 
days a reference book will help 
more precise is the specific information in seed catalogs or on 
seed packets some varieties of the same vegetables are genetically 
ready to eat earlier or later than others 
while seed sellers take this into account they also tend to be 
optimistic so its wise to routinely add a week or so to the 
catalogpacket estimate then allow for some plants of the same 
variety to mature later or before others 
after such approximations and if your beets say are supposed 
to mature in 60 days plant a third of the seed packet at the 
recommended time follow with another third 20 days later and the 
final third after another 20 days 
the idea is to let natures growthregulating system supply 
vegetables at peak quality over a long period this works 
especially well with crops such as lettuce green onions carrots 
radishes and beets and is effective with just about everything 
throughout a growing season 
but it wont work for every vegetable notably zucchini which 
seems to produce more than even zucchini lovers like me can 
consume or give away despite careful planning 
one friend never plants zucchini on the theory that neighbors 
will keep him supplied and he makes them fel great by accepting 
their surplus another friend fills 20pound grocery bags with 
zucchini places them on neighbors doorsteps rings the doorbell 
and runs 
how is peak quality determined frequent sampling is effective 
and simple remember that most vegetables taste best when fully 
developed but before they turn the corner to maturity 
such an idea will bring hoots from commercial growers and from 
home gardeners who freeze or can their produce their need is for 
everything to be ready for harvest about the same time for ease of 
handling most seed crops are developed to meet such timing needs 
its a valid position for mass production of food its also one 
reason that so many storebought vegetables taste so bland 
so if taste is your reason for growing vegetables experiment 
with successive planting there is nothing sacred about planting a 
third of a seed packet at a time divide the packet by four or 
five or in half if this works better 
remember too that growing seasons seldom are the same from 
year to year so adjustments may be needed 
as for using sets to produce green onions purists will insist 
that scallions or bunching onions are best grown from seed 
designed to produce white bulbless onions this is true but 
fresh onions for the table from sets are easy and inexpensive 
arrive three weeks or more before those from seeds and can be 
planted later in the season 
they also are a great way to spark childrens interest in 
gardening kids love to push the marblesize sets into the ground 
and love the almost immediate results the process also has been 
known to convert nongardening adults 
if space is limited the most spaceefficient vegetables include 
beets broccoli beans cabbage carrots leaf lettuce onions 
radishes and tomatoes

negative attitudes toward the elderly may 
block their access to the rehabilitation services after accidents 
illness or surgery a study says 
the problem of paying for such services represents the greatest 
barrier to obtaining them according to the study released this 
summer by the american association of retired persons 
but it concluded that many older people do not get 
rehabilitation largely because of their age 
many people associate rehabilitation only with younger persons 
and the possibility of return to work and see no need to provide 
these services to older people it said 
yet rehabilitation can help older people to regain mobility 
and live independently following a stroke heart attack hip 
fracture or chronic illness 
rehabilitation refers to services such as physical occupational 
and speech therapy and rehabilitative nursing and the report 
asserts the provision of rehabilitation services may make the 
difference between a person who is bedfast and a person who can 
walk with a walker

the debate over how much the state should 
pay for the cost of caring for nursing home residents has shifted 
from the statehouse to the courtroom 
two groups sued this month alleging the state is not paying 
enough 
the kansas health care association and the kansas association 
for homes for the aging filed the lawsuit in us district court 
against the department of social and rehabilitation services the 
groups represent 330 privately owned and nonprofit nursing homes 
in kansas 
we have worked extensively at the administrative and 
legislative branches of government to work out a solution to the 
rising health care costs of caring for our senior population but 
to no avail said lou esplund chairwoman of kaha 
the lawsuit complains that the srs payment system violates a 
federal law that requires states to pay reasonable and adequate 
costs for nursing home care 
tim owens attorney for srs declined to comment 
john grace president of the kansas association of homes for the 
aging said federally mandated regulations took effect oct 1 
requiring that nurses be on duty 24 hours 
the state has earmarked 2 million to cover the cost of that 
regulation and others but srs officials estimated the total cost 
would be 30 million

of the three contenders to succeed margaret 
thatcher as prime minister former defense secretary michael 
heseltine would bring in the biggest economic changes analysts 
say 
but no matter who wins economists say no drastic changes such 
as big tax hikes or renationalizing industries are in sight 
thats because heseltine and the other two challengers foreign 
secretary douglas hurd and chancellor of the exchequer john major 
are capitalist conservative party members with impeccable 
thatcherite credentials as one economist put it 
all three candidates have stressed that they want to build on 
mrs thatchers accomplishments while suggesting they envision a 
gentler kinder britain 
the differences between them are much more style than 
substance said george hodgson an analyst at the london 
investment firm warburg securities 
paul turnbull an economist with smith new court plc said 
the outlook for the uk economy is not radically different 
whoever is in power 
any of the three would continue current economic policy of high 
interest rates to fight 109 percent inflation although the winner 
is expected to quickly cut the 14 percent base lending rate by a 
half or full percentage point to gain popularity 
the winner will have little control over the current downward 
course of the economy partly because britain has joined europes 
exchange rate mechanism the economists said 
that limits the governments ability to change interest rates 
very much because the pound must fluctuate within a narrow band 
the new conservative party leaders policies are also bound to 
be influenced by the necessity to contest the socialist labor party 
in a national election by mid1992 
heseltine 57 is a flamboyant and ambitious selfmade 
publishing millionaire who has patiently waited his opportunity 
since he walked out of mrs thatchers cabinet in 1986 
he won enough votes from conservative party members in a ballot 
last week to force a second ballot this coming tuesday prompting 
mrs thatcher to resign major and hurd then stepped forward 
together in a friendly challenge to heseltine 
also selfmade the 47yearold major is a poor acrobats son 
who climbed up from welfare recipient to banker to the top of his 
party his campaign promotes the creation of a classless 
meritocracy in britain 
hurd 60 was educated at eton and cambridge and was a career 
diplomat before entering politics he has been in the cabinet since 
1984 but has never been involved with economic issues 
the most notable difference among the challengers is that 
heseltine believes in government solutions to industrial problems 
major and hurd emphasize free markets although hurd is regarded as 
the more liberal tory of the two 
heseltine would try to make the management of the uk economy 
similar in style to what he thinks happened in japan and germany 
where the government takes a much more interventionist line in 
trying to achieve certain strategic aims in industry said david 
kern chief economist at national westminster bank 
this has raised fears in the financial markets that he would 
strap companies with obligations and increase public spending 
which would undermine the countrys budget surplus and raise 
interest rates 
however kern added im not so sure in practice there will be 
that much difference 
the economists also said heseltine would go furthest on the two 
promises all the candidates have made to embrace european union 
more enthusiastically than mrs thatcher did and to take another 
look at the highly unpopular percapita community charge or poll 
tax 
however kern noted that whoever the winner is britains 
tense relationship with europe wont become a great love affair 
hodgson said all the contenders have got immaculate 
thatcherite credentials they are all fully committed to 
privatization theyre all fully committed to lowering tax rates as 
quickly as possible and as is prudent hodgson said 
you may say that thatcher may have gone but the fundamental 
commitment of the conservative party to widen individual choice by 
shrinking government remains theirs hodgson said

if a deal were reached mca would be the second hollywood studio 
to be acquired by a japanese company in little more than a year and 
the fourth major american studio to be controlled by a 
foreignbased owner 
mcas competitor sony corp of japan agreed in september 1989 
to aquire columbia pictures entertainment inc for about 5 billion 
including assumed debt 
two other major hollywood studios are owned by foreign

september and it was reported they were discussing a price of 80 
to 90 a share 
the discussions reportedly intensified in the past week

in the largest japanese purchase of a us company 
matsushita electric industrial co said today it was buying mca 
inc owner of universal studios for 606 billion 
matsushita a 27 billion giant known for such brand names as 
panasonic quasar and technics is japans biggest manufacturer of 
consumer electronics equipment 
by buying the maker of such box office hits as jaws and 
back to the future matsushita seemed to be trying to keep pace 
with archrival sony corp which bought columbia pictures 
entertainment inc for 5 billion a year ago analysts said 
universal is the fourth hollywood studio to come under foreign 
control the deal seems likely to exacerbate some fears in the 
united states that too many major us companies are falling under 
japanese control 
under the agreement matsushita is to start a cash tender offer 
of 66 a share for mcas common stock by nov 30 
mca chairman and chief executive officer lew wasserman 77 
stands to earn about 330 million from the deal wasserman had 
personal holdings of 5 million mca shares or 7 percent and 
controlled an additional 6 million through trusts and charities 
matsushita is a great international company wasserman said 
this combination assures the structural integrity of mca and its 
worldwide operation mca will continue to operate under its own 
name and will be run by its existing management 
the purchase which followed two months of intense sometimes 
frustrating negotiations is seen as matsushitas attempt to 
dominate the growing alliance of technological hardware and 
entertainment industries 
software and hardware have been developing simultaneously 
they are like wheels of the same car akio tanii matsushitas 
president said at company headquarters in osaka we intend that 
excellent works made by mca will be distributed all over the world 
through a variety of media 
analysts say matsushita will now have a ready stock of 
highprofile movie and television programming to use for its high 
definition television considered the next generation in home 
entertainment

oil prices soared about 2 per barrel on the 
futures market early today as traders speculated the united 
nations was about to authorize the use of force to push iraq out of 
kuwait 
its rocking and rolling in here this morning said brian 
tagler a broker with shearson lehman brothers inc the big news 
is the us is said to be seeking a jan 1 deadline for an iraqi 
withdrawal 
us officials said they plan ask the un security council this 
week to approve a resolution that would authorize the use of 
military force against iraq if saddam hussein does not pull his 
troops out of kuwait by the first of the year iraq said it would 
not get out of kuwait which it occupied during august 
oil traders responded by bidding up the price of crude oil by 
almost 2 per barrel at the opening of trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
traders are looking for the resolution to be approved 
tagler said while a un resolution would not be an act of war he 
said the possibility that it will be approved leads oil traders to 
believe war in the persian gulf is now more likely 
by late morning light sweet crude was up 205 at 3395 on 
contracts for delivery in january contracts for delivery in later

as crude futures shot up contracts of delivery of refined

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a texas telephone company that accused one of the socalled baby 
bell phone companies of trying to drive it out of business 
the court without comment refused to block southwestern bell 
from increasing access rates charged to the texas company from 
5000 to about 77000 a month 
the texas firm dfw metro line services offers customers a flat 
rate for calls between dallas and fort worth 
dfw uses telephone lines leased from southwestern bell 
the regional bell company told dfw in june 1989 it must pay 
about 77000 a month to lease the lines 
southwestern bell said it had been charging dfw only 5000 a 
month in the mistaken beief that dfw provided its customers with a 
paging service only 
but dfw said southwesterns real motive was to drive the texas 
company out of business and eliminate a competitor 
a federal judge refused dfws request for an order that would 
bar southwestern from increasing the access rates pending the 
outcome of dfws lawsuit against the baby bell company 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals last may also refused to 
issue an injunction blocking the rate increase 
the appeals court said dfw failed to show it would suffer 
irreparable injury from the rate hike the appeals court said that 
if dfw loses customers or even is forced out of business it 
ultimately still could prevail in its suit against southwestern and 
recover any losses it suffered 
the lost goodwill of a business operated over a short period 
of time is usually compensable in money damages the appeals 
court said 
dfw has been in business since 1988 
the case is dfw metro line services vs southwestern bell

soybean futures prices were modestly higher in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade after an opening 
surge linked to perceptions that a ussoviet grain deal is near 
wheat futures were fractionally lower corn futures were 
slightly higher 
soviet grainbuying officials were visiting washington today and 
were expected to discuss with government representatives the 
possibility of receiving export credits and striking a new 
longterm grain agreement 
dan cekander grains analyst with the chicago trading company 
rodman amp renshaw inc said a new grain agreement is not likely 
until the soviets buy the 600000 metric tons of us corn and 1 
million metric tons of us wheat that remain under an existing 
grain pact 
cekander said strength in international vegetable oil markets 
also helped boost soybean prices 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 248 a 
bushel corn was cent to 1 cent higher with december at 222 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents lower with december at 107 a 
bushel and soybeans were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with january at 
584 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange paced by sharp losses in the pork 
complex

after two weeks of declines the number of 
working oil and gas rigs in the united states rebounded by 72 this 
week to bring the total to 1175 nationwide baker hughes inc 
reported monday 
some of that clearly is improvement of the weather that had 
been bad for the past two weeks particularly in oklahoma said 
ike kerridge a vice president at the toolmaker which keeps the 
count but it also relates to the seasonal upturn expected during 
the last quarter of the year 
the number of rigs had fallen by 41 rigs over the past two 
weeks following heavy rains in the oklahoma area a year ago this 
week the number of working rigs was 1037 
kerridge said he could not forecast changes for the count but 
believed it would grow in december because drillers will be using 
any remaining funds in calendaryear budgets 
i still expect to see a rig count around 1250 in december 
but whether that will be at the beginning of the month or the 
middle or the end i cant say kerridge said the weather and 
the random movement of rigs that can effect it makes it impossible 
to predict on a weekbyweek basis 
decreases in the previous weeks came on the heels of a milestone 
earlier in the month when the number of working rigs reached 1144 
a high figure not seen since dec 28 1987 
baker hughes has kept track of the rig count the widely 
watched index of drilling activity since 1940 the count 
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil not those 
producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
texas led the major oil producing states for the week by adding 
23 rigs to the count followed by oklahoma whose count increased 
by 16 and louisiana which added 11 rigs 
other major oil producing states reporting increases for the 
week include california up by nine wyoming adding eight 
colorado adding six kansas which increased by four new mexico 
up by three and michigan and north dakota which each added a rig 
ohio was the only major oil producing state to report a loss for 
the week dropping by one the count in pennsylvania remained 
unchanged

the government today proposed freezing 50 percent 
of the bank accounts of stateowned businesses by saturday in an 
effort to cut the national budget deficit tass reported 
the national defense budget also would drop by 10 percent and 
other soviet agencies would take cuts of up to 30 percent under the 
1991 national budget proposed to the legislature the official news 
agency said 
finance minister victor pavlov also said the nations gross 
national product in the first nine months of 1990 dropped by 13 
billion rubles or 234 billion at the official rate from the 
previous year according to tass the government last month had 
said gnp for the period dropped 15 percent 
the report was one of the most comprehensive yet on the state of 
the national economy but a flourishing black market critical 
shortages of most basic consumers goods and economic rebellion by 
many of the 15 soviet republics made it difficult to determine how 
the final budget would shape up 
tass said the government budget was being divided for the first 
time into national and republic levels it put the national 
governments share of the budget at 261 billion rubles slightly 
less than half the total 
the proposal on bank accounts if approved would be the first 
large selloff of shares in stateowned businesses in soviet 
history and a significant step in a massive scheme to denationalize 
stateowned industries 
the proposal amounts to a drastic lastditch effort to cut the 
enormous soviet budget deficit before the end of the year the 
deficit stood last year at about 120 billion rubles 
pavlov told lawmakers that officials projected that this years 
national deficit would be 56 billion rubles or about 100 billion 
out of a budget of 508 billion rubles 915 billion it was not 
clear if the figures included the spending freeze 
the proposal would allow employees to receive the frozen funds 
only in the form of stock shares in their companies 
tass said the government would freeze 50 billion to 60 billion 
rubles 90 billion 108 billion of stateowned businesses 
accounts half of their total deposits that the enterprises fail 
to use before saturday 
but the resources may be transferred to work collectives to buy 
shares in the enterprises the news agency said the moratorium 
would be temporary but did not say how long it would last it was 
not clear whether employees would hold the stock in their own names 
or as a group 
as part of the attempt to slash the budget deficit 1991 foreign 
aid will be cut to onequarter of this years level tass said a 
number of communist countries such as cuba have relied heavily on 
soviet subsidies and are likely to be hit hard by the cutbacks 
the defense budget is to drop to 64 billion rubles 115 
billion next year tass said that would be roughly 40 percent of 
the proposed national budget 
the soviet government bureaucracy faces a 30 percent budget cut 
tass reported no other details were offered and it was unclear 
which government agencies would be hit hardest

in the largest japanese purchase of a us company 
matsushita electric industrial co said today it would buy mca 
inc owner of universal studios in a deal worth 66 billion 
matsushita a 378 billion giant known for such brand names as 
panasonic quasar and technics is japans biggest manufacturer of 
consumer electronics equipment 
by buying the maker of such box office hits as jaws and 
back to the future matsushita seemed to be trying to keep pace 
with archrival sony corp which bought columbia pictures 
entertainment inc for 5 billion a year ago analysts said 
universal is the fourth hollywood studio to come under foreign 
control the deal seems likely to exacerbate some fears in the 
united states that too many major us companies are falling under 
japanese control 
under the agreement matsushita is to start a cash tender offer 
of 66 a share for mcas about 928 million shares of common stock 
by nov 30 
mca shareholders will also get stock in a television station 
that cannot be sold to matsushita because federal rules prohibit 
foreignbased companies from owning us broadcast stations 
the deal calls for mca shareholders to get one share in a new 
company that will own mcas new yorkarea television station wwor 
for every five shares of mca stock they own just before the tender 
offer is completed 
company officials have estimated the new shares will be worth 
about 5 for every share of mca stock adding that to the 66 per 
share in cash brings the pershare value to 71 or nearly 66 
billion for mcas fully diluted shares 
in trading on the new york stock exchange mca was the most 
actively traded issue slipping 25 cents a share by late morning to 
6512 
mca chairman and chief executive officer lew wasserman 77 
stands to earn about 355 million from the deal based on his 
personal holdings alone of about 5 million mca shares or 7 
percent in addition he controls an additional 6 million through 
trusts and charities 
matsushita is a great international company wasserman said 
this combination assures the structural integrity of mca and its 
worldwide operation mca will continue to operate under its own 
name and will be run by its existing management 
the purchase which followed two months of intense sometimes 
frustrating negotiations is seen as matsushitas attempt to 
dominate the growing alliance of technological hardware and 
entertainment industries 
software and hardware have been developing simultaneously 
they are like wheels of the same car akio tanii matsushitas 
president said at company headquarters in osaka we intend that 
excellent works made by mca will be distributed all over the world 
through a variety of media 
analysts say matsushita will now have a ready stock of 
highprofile movie and television programming to use for its high 
definition television considered the next generation in home 
entertainment 
matsushita has been behind sony in audiovisual and 
entertainment fields in the last couple of years said takatoshi 
yamamoto of the investment firm morgan stanley by acquiring mca 
matsushita can obtain movie record broadcast and publishing 
industries all at once 
looking at the longterm effect of the deal it will benefit 
matsushita in producing and marketing hdtv the competition for 
which is expected to intensify in the mid1990s he said 
but in an atmosphere of trade friction between the united states 
and japan not to mention the potential of a further downturn in 
the us economy matsushita is taking a big risk analysts say 
the biggest problem is the negative image f japanese buying 
up everything in the us said rodney harada an analyst for 
merrill lynch in tokyo one of the biggest reasons i was 
surprised by the deal was because matsushita has always been 
careful to improve its image before 
in addition to the japanese purchases 20th century fox is owned 
by rupert murdochs news corp based in australia and 
italiancontrolled pathe communications corp recently completed a 
13 billion buyout of mgmua communications inc 
japanese companies have caught most of the us criticism 
however after making other highprofile purchases such as 
rockefeller center and the pebble beach golf club 
but matsushita one of the worlds leading manufacturers of 
industrial equipment and semiconductors may have considered the 
deal a risk it couldnt refuse 
japanese consumer electronics companies have been looking to 
hollywood to revitalize a flagging market for consumer video 
products and expand their control over the lucrative home 
entertainment market purchases of film libraries for instance 
allow them to release old movies and television shows in videotape 
format 
people dont watch electrons and pixels steven ross 
chairman of another entertainment industry hybrid timewarner 
inc said in a recent speech they watch movies and programs 
new technologies are stillborn without software to animate 
them 
sony also purchased cbs records for example and successfully 
used it in the 1980s to launch the compact disc as a format 
nonetheless several analysts said the muchtouted natural 
linkup between hardware manufacturers and movie video and tv 
entertainment companies is still an unproven strategy for one 
thing digitalizing older movies and tv programs for hdtv is very 
expensive 
it looks like theyre doing it and trying to figure out 
strategy afterward said mike jeremy an analyst in tokyo for 
baring securities 
in japan matsushita is jokingly called maneshita or 
copycat for its custom of introducing products only after its 
competitors have tested the market for them 
but some people envision a future of integrated home 
entertainment consoles that would include hdtv a personal 
computer stereo and other gadgetry and that future may accrue to 
the company with the most prominent image analysts said 
sony has a strong image people in most countries would 
automatically know what a walkman is said jeremy matsushita 
has panasonic quasar and technics but they need to rationalize 
themselves into one image 
apart from universal pictures which also produced such hits as 
et the extraterrestrial mcas holdings include a robust 
television division featuring winners like murder she wrote 
and quantum leap mca records carries the popular teen vocalist 
tiffany as well as the sultry star sheena easton 
mca which earned 191 million last year on revenues of 34 
billion also owns a book publishing division theme parks and real 
estate 
matsushita earned 148 billion on sales of 378 billion last 
year

from a can of beans to a new car to a 100000 
variable rate mortgage its nearly impossible these days to find 
out in advance how much cash youll be paying out 
it may get worse with recession threatening and consumer 
confidence low so many merchants are cutting prices that the slash 
mark in advertisements is almost as common as the dollar sign 
there are regular prices discount prices former prices 
todayonly prices sale prices cashonly prices credit card 
prices special prices onetimeonly prices and prices with 
discounts and rebates 
mix in sales taxes and centsoff and dollarsoff coupons and 
maybe figure in the specials of the day at the grocery store and 
the arithmetic defies your ability to determine the total bill 
should you plan ahead and do the calculations in advance you 
might then find prices changed by the time you get to the store 
quick price changes are easy on highvolume items and electronic 
computers make it all the easier 
price confusion has long been the bane of the frequent traveler 
who is confronted with so many airline rates and exceptions by 
day of week or week of year that agents become addled and cant 
figure their own commission 
car rental contracts may add mystery to the trip and hotel room 
charges including local taxes can make a mockery of socalled 
quick checkout services skip the car rental and take a cab sure 
and try to decipher the rate card 
perhaps you buy a car instead by law prices are posted on new 
car sales but rare is the person who can predict to the penny what 
the total will be if a tradein is involved a nobel laureate 
might shy from the challenge 
so you stay home nobody says you have to buy you can 
communicate by telephone instead yes but your telephone bills 
might be too involved to communicate with you 
well you can read too and as your peruse your magazine you 
pull out a card offering a big discount off the newsstand price 
meanwhile you spot an ad for the latest bestseller novel 
published price 1995 our price 1654 
in this day and age of course you can also communicate by 
facsimile or computer but to get into that modern mode you must 
first own one or the other you search the ads and you read 
under 799 and from 499 up 
this is a freemarket economy at work the biggest in the world 
and you might argue that a variety of prices and frequent price 
changes reflect intense competition but there are those who are 
convinced it is meant to confuse 
how in the name of rationality they ask did automobile prices 
to cite one example out of thousands get way up there after years 
of refunds rebates dealer discounts and desperate salesmen 
giving up part of their commissions 
how they ask do consumer prices rise at 5 percent a year if 
almost everyone is slashing away like a bushwacker in the jungle 
and most of the rest are boasting that theirs are everyday low 
prices 
there is a mystery here and a challenge to those would seek the 
answers it is important to us all somewhere on the scale between 
those other great unknowns such as where the lost socks go and 
whats out there in space

the supreme court on monday refused to end an 
affirmative action program aimed at awarding more public works 
contracts to businesses run by minorities and women 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by companies that 
said the tampa flaarea program is unconstitutional because it 
condones reverse discrimination against white men 
the affirmative action program was adopted in 1984 by 
hillsborough county which set a goal of awarding 25 percent of the 
value of all annual construction contracts to businesses owned by 
women and minorities 
the program in effect calls for officials to favor contractors 
who have lined up companies run by minorities and women as 
subcontractors 
if the contractor submitting the low bid on a project has met 
the countys affirmative action goals that company is likely to 
win the contract but the low bidder may lose if it fails to 
convince officials it has at least made a goodfaith effort to meet 
those goals 
in other cases affecting businesses the court 
rejected a challenge to the seizure by us customs agents of 
some 2700 allegedly obscene magazines that were shipped from 
cleveland and denied entry into canada the justices without 
comment let stand rulings that the magazines could be treated as 
imports from a foreign country once they were headed back to 
cleveland 
refused to kill two fairhousing lawsuits that stem from 
newspaper real estate advertisements showing only white models 
posing as homeowners the justices without comment let stand a 
ruling that forces developers of a virginia condominium community 
to defend themselves against allegations they violated the fair 
housing act 
rejected an appeal by a texas telephone company that accused 
one of the baby bell local phone companies of trying to drive 
it out of business the court without comment refused to block 
southwestern bell from increasing access rates charged to the texas 
company from 5000 to about 77000 a month 
in the florida affirmative action case after a group of 
whiteowned construction companies sued to overturn the program a 
federal judge ruled it was unconstitutional and barred the county 
from enforcing it 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals overruled the judge last 
august and reinstated the program saying that at least on its 
face it does not violate the constitutions equalprotection 
guarantees 
the appeals court sent the suit back for a trial at which the 
whiteowned companies will have a chance to prove their 
allegations 
the court said the hillsborough plan appears to be significantly 
different from a socalled setaside program adopted by richmond 
va that was overturned by the supreme court last year 
the richmond plan established a quota that required 30 percent 
of the value of annual public works contracts to be awarded to 
minority businesses 
in striking down that plan the high court said local 
governments must narrowly tailor affirmative action plans to remedy 
proven past bias 
the appeals court said hillsborough county acted only after a 
sixyear wholly voluntary plan failed to do enough to help 
minorities and women in the building industry 
unlike richmond hillsborough county decided to implement its 
law based on statistics indicating that there was discrimination 
specifically in the construction business commissioned by the 
county the appeals court said 
it noted that the county shunned rigid quotas and only adopted 
flexible goals for awarding contracts to minorities and women

grain and soybean futures prices fell moderately 
monday on the chicago board of trade amid fading hopes for new 
sales of us crops to the soviet union 
most of the gains posted late last week were erased by selling 
that accelerated after agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
the bush administration still insists the soviet union formally 
liberalize its emigration policies before it can be eligible for 
export credit guarantees 
soviet grainbuying officials met with agriculture department 
officials monday crop futures prices especially for soybeans had 
risen sharply ahead of the meetings on speculation they could lead 
to new grain sales

the contract for delivery in december at 243 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 218 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 104 a bushel

the supreme court on monday refused to shield 
a whooping cough vaccine manufacturer from a lawsuit that said 
company negligence caused brain damage in an inoculated infant 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by wyethayerst 
laboratories to stop the suit 
michelle graham was given the vaccine in 1980 when she was a few 
months old soon after she was diagnosed as suffering from severe 
brain damage that causes retardation 
the grahams who sued wyeth in kansas and have since moved to 
cabool mo said the new york citybased company was negligent 
the vaccine is used to immunize children against diphtheria 
tetanus and pertussis charles and tammy graham said the vaccine 
component against pertussis or whooping cough was responsible for 
their daughters brain damage 
a federal jurys 15 million award to the grahams was overturned 
by the 10th us circuit court of appeals last june 
but the appeals court while saying the trial judge improperly 
excluded evidence that could help the drug company refused to kill 
the suit 
wyeth said such suits should be precluded because its vaccine is 
licensed by the us food and drug administration 
the company argued that letting the grahams sue has the effect 
of making state laws supreme over federal law in violation of the 
constitution 
kansas laws on personal injury claims govern the outcome of the 
suit even though it would be tried in federal court in that state 
congress recently extended the deadline to file claims under the 
national vaccine injury act which provides some compensation for 
those injured by vaccines 
the deadline for those injured on or before oct 1 1988 was 
extended from oct 1 1990 to jan 31 1991 but failure to file 
by the deadline does not bar the grahams or anyone else frm suing 
for damages

boise cascade corp said monday it expects 
to break even financially during the final three months of 1990 
officials at the wood products company said a weakening market 
for paper pulp and corrugated containers expansion costs and 
higher interest rates will reduce boise cascades profitability 
in a statement the corporation predicted results for the 
fourth quarter of 1990 to be close to breakeven compared with 
earnings of 27 cents per share in the third quarter

million in net income for 1990 that compares to 2676 million in 
1989 2891 million in 1988 and 183 million in 1987 
in its earnings forecast the company cited further weakening in 
some markets high interest rates and modernization expenses at its 
mills in rumford maine and international falls minn it also 
said its building products segment has been operating at a loss 
since september because of high wood costs sluggish demand and 
declining prices 
boisecascade has been on a costefficiency drive since 
undergoing severe economic stress in the early 1980s while 
gradually shifting its emphasis away from building products to

despite a looming recession alan markus began 
the christmas season at his lazarus department store without the 
financial worries that dogged the company a year ago 
christmas 1989 fell three weeks before an avalanche of junk bond 
debt forced federated department stores inc and allied stores 
corp to seek bankruptcy court protection for lazarus 
bloomingdales jordan marsh and seven other department store 
chains 
but the lazarus that markus manages a block away from federated 
and allied headquarters can already see the difference a year 
makes 
in 1989 we experienced some situations where we had 
difficulty receiving merchandise whereas this year thats not a 
problem markus said in an interview recently 
as they undergo chapter 11 reorganization federated and allied 
subsidiaries of torontobased campeau corp have back some of the 
stability and confidence they lacked at the start of last years 
christmas shopping season 
under bankruptcy law their current suppliers are guaranteed 
payment and while the retailers have undertaken a series of 
costcutting steps other storeowners are now being forced to make 
the same moves to protect themselves from the current slump in 
consumer spending 
to cut costs the federated and allied chains have centralized 
their credit operations cut back their executive staff and set up 
committees to plan merchandise buying their bankruptcy court 
status also let them end an expensive lease in new york 
if there is a plus to our being in reorganization its that 
we have already taken those steps federated and allied 
spokeswoman carol sanger said 
janet mangano an industry analyst for jessup josephthal amp co 
said of the campeau units theyre probably one of the 
bestpositioned retailers because they were pretty much faced 
with the worst kind of environment excluding a recession in 
1990 
they changed their merchandise mix and got their shop in 
order she said 
federated and allied sought protection from their creditors on

yosemite park amp curry co 
will be sold to a qualified american buyer when matsushita 
electric industrial co completes its acquisition of mca inc 
officials said monday 
the park concession has been a small but controversial division 
of mca which matsushita has offered to acquire in a deal worth 
66 billion 
matsushita one of japans largest consumer electronics 
manufacturers will spin the concession off to blunt criticism over 
a japanese company operating a national park concession interior 
secretary manuel lujan has indicated he would oppose a foreign 
company playing a major role at yosemite or other parks 
a press release said matsushita will sell the concession to be 
responsive to environmental and other concerns that have been 
raised 
the concession will be sold within a year after matsushitas 
acquisition of mca is completed the press release added 
prior to the sale yosemite park and curry will be held in 
escrow and operated by its existing management and board said 
john poimiroo the concessions vice president for communications 
he explained that yosemite park amp curry co currently has a board 
of directors separate from mcas 
between the time the sale of mca becomes final and matsushita 
sells curry the concessions income will be donated to the 
national park foundation to benefit yosemite and other national 
parks poimiroo said 
whoever buys the concession will have to seek renewal of its 
contract with the national park service in 1993 
renewal may not be gained easily because mca has been criticized 
for paying too little in its current agreement and one other 
bidder already has surfaced a group of environmentalists have 
formed the nonprofit yosemite restoration trust to try to win the 
concession business which includes restaurants stores 
transportation and lodging 
david curry began the concession in 1899 nine years after the 
park was founded the present company was formed in 1925 and 
purchased by mca in 1973

whittle communications said monday that more 
than 5700 schools have signed contracts for its commercially 
sponsored channel one news show for teens and expects to reach its 
goal of 8600 schools by next june 
chairman christopher whittle said all of the services available 
commercial time has been either sold or optioned for sale to 13 
different advertisers for the januaryjune period 
ed winter the whittle executive overseeing the channel one 
project told reporters at a news briefing that channel one should 
generate 65 million in gross revenue this school year during 
which the number of schools under contract rose from about 600 in 
october 1989 to its november total of 5718 
he said revenues should rise to 110 million in the 199192 
school year which would be the first at which the service operated 
for an entire year with its full complement of schools 
winter said that is more than four times the 25 million cable 
news network generated in its third year and more than triple the 
37 million that espn produced in its third year in operation espn 
and cnn are among the biggest cable tv networks in the united 
states 
the channel one service has been widely criticized by national 
education groups for bringing paid advertising into the classroom 
when children are required by law to be in school and must sit and 
watch 
each 12minute show includes two minutes of paid commercials for 
products such as breath mints candy bars movies and toothpaste 
whittle transmits the show to schools by satellite overnight 
each night the knoxville tennbased media company equips every 
participating school with videocassette recorders and tv monitors 
for every classroom that the schools can keep as long as they show 
the program with ads daily to all their students 
the producers of the program say schools would not have access 
to the equipment were it not for the money generated for it from 
commercials 
the schools signed to date are in every state except hawaii 
alaska maine rhode island and nevada 
whittle told reporters that once channel one reaches 8000 
schools it will begin to exhaust its budget for equipment and will 
have to sign up more advertisers to pay for the additional tvs and 
vcrs 
he said channel one wont increase the amount of advertising it 
carries per show but may cut back on how often each advertiser 
appears and may cut out its donation of free time for public 
service messages such as antidrug ads 
advertisers are currently charged at a rate of 150000 for a 
30second commercial reaching an audience of 6 million teens 
whittle says that rate compares favorably with those available for 
reaching teens on other tv shows 
for next school year whittle said he hopes to use the channel 
one system to make available up to five special programs that may 
include advertising or be available on a payperview basis to 
schools that wish to show them 
he said topics for the specials could include a 30minute 
program on a space shot for instance or shows related to academic 
courses 
in addition he said channel one will consider leasing its 
transmission system to other program producers for afterschool 
events like a rock concert a sports show or meetings by various 
groups 
participating schools will not be obligated to use such 
programs 
we dont make the decision on whether these programs will be 
aired the schools make the decision on whether to air it he 
said 
whittle said he doesnt expect the revenue generated from such 
programs will ever exceed 15 percent of the revenue generated for 
channel one

the united states may boost subsidies of its 
agricultural exports should international trade talks fail to 
reduce foreign trade barriers agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said monday 
the final round of the talks is scheduled next week in brussels 
and the chances of reaching an agreement to cut agricultural 
subsidies worldwide is very slim yeutter said 
yeutter has refused to say how the united states would retaliate 
against european countries if they refuse to agree to subsidy cuts 
the united states wants 
what ive indicated persistently and consistently in recent 
months is that well protect our own interests the european 
community can draw its own conclusions as to what that means and 
were not going to telescope what that means yeutter said 
however the 1990 farm bill authorizes congress to increase us 
export subsidies to 1 billion a year to counter foreign farm 
supports about 425 million is budgeted for 1991 
were pleased that authorization is there because it may 
become essential yeutter said during a questionandanswer 
session with reporters 
ec countries spend 20 times as much as the united states on 
export subsidies yeutter said thats just an intolerable 
situation 
the bush administration proposed eliminating 75 percent of 
current domestic farm supports and import barriers and reducing 
export subsidies by 90 percent 
the ec has offered to trim 30 percent of 1986 support levels 
the farm issue is considered key to completion of the current 
round of global trade talks which involve 105 nations under the 
auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the administration has made gatt reform a top priority in the 
belief that lowering trade barriers offers the best chance of 
expanding us exports of agricultural products and other goods and 
services 
dairy producers for example need new markets overseas because 
domestic consumption is reaching its limit yeutter said 
he defended the market orientation of the 1990 farm bill saying 
it would benefit farmers whose planting practices were restricted 
by government policy 
the fiveyear farm bill now awaiting president bushs signature 
gives farmers the option of planting what they choose on 15 percent 
of the acreage that is normally reserved for subsidized crops 
another provision would pay farmers to idle wheat acreage and 
plant sunflowers and other oilseeds that many farmers have quit 
growing in recent years 
if we believe in markets we should be favorably disposed to 
these provisions yeutter said if we dont believe in markets 
we should move to the soviet union

grain and soybean futures prices fell broadly monday on the 
chicago board of trade amid fading hopes for new sales of us 
crops to the soviet union 
on other commodity markets pork futures plunged cattle futures 
were mostly higher oil futures surged and precious metals 
advanced 
in chicago wheat futures settled 4 cents to 6 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 243 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 218 a bushel oats 
were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with december at 104 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with january at 576 a 
bushel 
mondays losses erased most of the gains the grain and soybean 
markets posted late last week selling accelerated after 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the bush administration 
still insists the soviet union formally liberalize its emigration 
policies before it can be eligible for export credit guarantees 
yeutters statement dashed hopes that a meeting monday between 
agriculture department representatives and soviet officials would 
lead to a new grain sales 
i think there was a feeling that with political compromise 
over the soviet stand in the persian gulf situation the united 
states would compromise on food credit said william biedermann 
research director with the chicagoarea commodities brokerage 
allendale inc 
gerald zusel a vice president in the graintrading division of 
ed amp f man international futures inc said moscow has relaxed 
emigration restrictions unofficially the impasse over grain sales 
to the soviets is like a bad game in which us farmers are the 
losers because slack export sales mean low prices he said 
the administration is saying no change in export policy no 
credit the russians are saying no credit we aint buying zusel 
said 
pork futures crashed on the chicago mercantile exchange led by 
limit losses in the porkbelly market that reflected perceptions 
that high prices are stifling retail bacon demand 
the market got another dose of bearish news after the close when 
the usda released a monthly report that showed a much 
higherthanexpected supply of frozen pork bellies 
the government reported there were 55 million pounds of bellies 
in the nations commercial freezers on oct 31 although it was the 
secondlowest oct 31 stocks figure on record the number was far 
above the average trade estimate of 47 million pounds 
thomas morgan president of sterling research inc said the 
market likely will fall further in the near term but the bottom 
line is we still need to put more bellies into storage 
cattle prices firmed as the discount of futures to cash prices 
stimulated buying interest on the futures market 
live cattle futures were 10 cent to 50 cent higher with 
december at 7875 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower 
to 45 cent higher with january at 8822 cents a pound live hogs 
were 72 cent to 143 cents lower with december at 5202 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 18 cents to the permitted daily 
limit of 2 cents lower with february at 6940 cents a pound 
oil futures jumped on the new york mercantile exchange as 
escalating tensions in the persian gulf standoff prompted new 
buying 
among the factors contributing to war fears were a warning from 
mikhail gorbachev that iraqs aggression against kuwait would be 
punished a callup of us combat reserves from four states and 
movement toward a united nations resolution authorizing force to 
drive iraq from kuwait 
light sweet crude oil futures finished 2 cents to 156 higher 
with january at 3295 a barrel heating oil was 207 cents to 396 
cents higher with december at 9238 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 18 cents to 25 cents higher with december at 842 
cents a gallon 
precious metal futures followed the oil markets higher 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 220 to 240 
higher with november at 38610 a troy ounce silver was 22 cents

hitachi ltd demonstrated a computer monday that 
mimics the learning and problemsolving capabilities of the human 
brain and said the machine is the fastest of its type 
the japanese computer maker said its socalled neural computer 
can carry out 23 billion operations per second the highest 
performance ever for such a machine 
hitachi demonstrated its computer at a technology fair it put on 
for reporters and financial analysts 
the machine contains 1152 neurons the electronic devices 
that act as processors in neural computers 
conventional computers need to be given an exact list of 
instructions for carrying out a job but a neural machine can 
figure out how to perform a task based on the information given it 
neural computers also can reconize patterns however neural 
machines are poor at numerical calculations the forte of 
conventional computers 
hitachi said its machine would be useful for programs such as 
signature recognition and predicting stock prices tasks that 
usually would require the power of a large and expensive 
supercomputers using conventional technology 
though hitachis machine is an experimental model a production 
version could be available in japan in as little as two years said 
shojiro asai deputy director of hitachis main research center 
he said production models would take the form of an attachment 
to conventional computer workstations

motorola inc has begun shipping large 
quantities of its most advanced computer microprocessor after a 
lengthy delay the company said monday 
the chip unveiled almost two years ago can execute 20 million 
instructions per second it combines functions that require up to 
50 chips in most computers 
but flaws have plagued the chip called the 68040 causing 
several production delays since it was announced in march 1989 the 
announcement beat arch rival intel corps unveiling of its 
advanced 80486 chip by about a month 
intel got its chip on the market last year 
murray goldman senior vice president of motorolas 
microprocessor and memory technologies group blamed the delays on 
the chips complexity it packs 12 million transistors and is 
among the fastest chips made 
the company used the delays to design a chip faster cheaper and 
smaller than its rivals goldman said 
it has hurt us that im late with the 040 goldman said i 
paid a price for doing this now my competitors are going to pay a 
price 
motorola switched production of the chip at its plant in austin 
texas on nov 16 and began shipping several hundred chips last 
week 
the company hopes to hit peak production of 1000 chips a week 
by january said jim reinhart marketing manager for the chip line 
microprocessors act as the brains or central processors of 
personal computers 
apple computer inc and hewlettpackard co lead 36 computer 
system and board manufacturers intending to use the 68040 in future 
products motorola said 
but one analyst believes the delays in achieving full production 
doomed the microprocessor group 
this is the latest in a long string of similar announcements 
said rick whittington semiconductor analyst for kidder peabody amp 
co in new york 
they went out and ballyhooed this thing a year and a half ago 
as the next coming of the lord and weve been waiting for it 
whittington said now its here we hope and its a good thing 
if not you could pretty well sign that groups death warrant as 
it is they get a reprieve but the patient has problems 
jay samstag vice president and computer analyst at duff amp 
phelps inc in chicago disagreed 
its a lead part and im sure theres other business that 
comes along with it but you have to put that in perspective they 
have a very large product line samstag said motorola stock 
closed at 53 monday on the new york stock exchange unchanged from 
fridays close

mca inc one of americas most 
precious entertainment gems will be acquired by japanese business 
giant matsushita electric industrial co in a 66 billion deal 
that firmly establishes japans presence in hollywood moviemaking 
even at that huge price tag the largest ever for a japanese 
purchase of a us company the deal announced monday was mildly 
disappointing to investors who had been anticipating the purchase 
since it was first rumored in september 
the purchase which includes universal studios figures out to 
about 71 per mca share the takeoverstarved market had been 
hoping for something closer to 90 
i would be happier if it was more sure but im very happy 
with the price said david geffen mcas largest single 
shareholder and head of geffen records an mca subsidiary geffen 
received his stock when mca bought his record company last year 
the deal will bring geffen more than 700 million 
but the buyout accomplishes an objective for matsushita which 
needed the entertainment software of mca to complement its 
electronics hardware the combination mirrors one struck by 
sony corp which bought columbia pictures entertainment inc for 
5 billion a year ago 
with mca in its fold matsushita will try to compete more 
effectively against its archrival sony and shake its image as a 
copycat exploiting the technological advances of other companies 
matsushita is japans largest electronics company and is 
familiar to american consumers through brand names such as 
panasonic technics and quasar mca which began 65 years ago as a 
booking agent for jazz bands has grown to become a colossus of 
films et the extraterrestrial jaws back to the 
future records reba mcentire elton john guns n roses bobby 
brown george strait and television murder she wrote 
major dad its florida and california theme parks are exceeded 
only by disneys 
software and hardware have been developing simultaneously 
they are like wheels of the same car akio tanii matsushitas 
president said at company headquarters in osaka japan we 
intend that excellent works made by mca will be distributed all 
over the world through a variety of media 
big foreign investments in hollywood have become a regular 
occurrence since rupert murdochs australiabased news corp bought 
20th century fox in 1985 
just this month mgmua communication co was purchased by 
italian financier giancarlo parrettis pathe communications for 
13 billion disney said last month it was launching a partnership 
to raise at least 600 million from japanese investors to make 
movies 
until the mca deal sonys acquisition of columbia was the 
largest japanese purchase of a us business sony also owns cbs 
records 
the merged matsushita and mca will yield a far larger company 
their combined revenues in 1990 will be 51 billion according to 
the value line investment survey that compares with 27 billion 
for sonycolumbia and 11 billion for the largest studiobased 
us conglomerate timewarner inc 
this agreement will create synergies that neither company 
could achieve alone said mca chairman lew wasserman who is 
widely regarded as a leader and mediator for all of hollywood not 
just mca 
mca president sidney sheinberg said the decision to sell mca was 
difficult but a nothing short of a duty to shareholders and 
employees given the globalization of the marketplace 
they have indicated their respect for our autonomy and 
corporate culture sheinberg said 
despite those assurances the acquisition seems certain to 
provide fuel for critics of japanese investment in the united 
states like the columbia deal and the recent purchases of real 
estate trophies such as rockefeller center in new york city and 
pebble beach in california 
matsushita is barred by federal law from owning one key mca 
property wwortv in the new york area that station will be spun 
off into a separate company with mcas current shareholders owning 
its stock 
addressing another sore point matsushita said mcas curry co 
subsidiary which operates restaurants hotels and other services 
in yosemite national park will be sold within a year curry is a 
tiny though highly profitable fragment of mcas business the idea 
of it being japaneseowned produced harsh criticism 
complaints go much further the record producing and composing 
legend quincy jones expressing the private fears of many in 
hollywood said recently that foreigners are being allowed to buy 
americas legacy 
in addition jewish groups have protested matsushitas honoring 
of the arabsponsored boycott of israel 
matsushitas discriminatory policies are not only 
reprehensible on ethical grounds but contradict the bedrock 
principle of free and open trade between nations the world 
jewish congress said in a statement monday 
most independent observers say matsushita knows it is foolish to 
meddle with an american success that has never been duplicated 
abroad 
they believe it will follow the lead of sony which has lavished 
hundreds of millions of dollars on megastars like michael jackson 
and megaproducers like peter guber and jon peters while adopting a 
generally handsoff style toward management of its us 
entertainment holdings 
it doesnt help them to interfere in the creative process and 
interfere in the quality of the product for some philosophical 
political or other purpose said jeff logsdon an entertainment 
analyst with siedler amdec securities inc 
mca stockholders will receive 66 per share in cash from 
matsushita except for the 5 million shares held by wasserman who 
will get an equivalent amount in preferred stock in a newly 
organized matsushita subsidiary for his shares the mca chief had 
sought to avoid having to pay taxes on a cash deal 
in addition mca shareholders will receive new stock in wwor 
which is worth about 5 per share of their mca common stock 
there are about 928 million shares of mca common stock 
outstanding on a fully diluted basis making the deal worth nearly 
66 billion 
mca officials originally had hoped for better but fears about 
debtladen deals in a sluggish economy made credit tight and 
investors wary worldwide 
the disappointment was evident in trading of mca shares monday 
which dropped 25 cents to 6512 while leading the most active 
list of new york stock exchange issues
