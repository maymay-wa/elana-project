forget regional pride scrap neighborly 
cooperation wisconsin and illinois have each accused the other of 
besmirching its reputation and the weapon of choice has been 
selected saberedged wit 
the two midwestern neighbors which for years have squabbled 
over pollution traffic tourists sports teams and bragging rights 
for best chili are at it again slashing at one another all over 
the media dueling ground 
chicago claims the badger state made the first thrust when an 
advertising campaign distributed postcards that used the chalkline 
of a homicide victim to portray chicago and a chalked hopscotch 
game to portray the tranquility of northeastern wisconsin 
the windy city parried with one of its biggest defenders 
humorist mike royko pulitzer prizewinning columnist for the 
chicago tribune 
royko called the advertising campaign by the fox valley chamber 
of commerce a cheap shot that made light of his citys serious 
crime problem he wrote a column that dismissed wisconsin residents 
as cheeseheads content to chomp on bratwurst 
royko wrote that the postcard was not sufficient provocation 
for a verbal feud then proceeded to paint a picture of wisconsin 
residents as deerhunting red flannelwearing cowkissing farm 
folk 
from its farms to its cities you wont find kinder simpler 
folk anywhere except in custodial care he continued 
given all the barbs that have been traded between the two states 
over the years royko said he was surprised by the angry reponse 
from wisconsin residents 
they were frothing at the lips which is kind of goofy 
royko said in an interview this week they struck the first blow 
i responded to a very tasteless card he said there are 
many people in chicago who have been victims of crimes homicide is 
not a laughing matter 
radio stations and marketing agencies have done their best to 
continue the war of words 
the attitude is that chicagoans think that milwaukeeans are 
just a bunch of heehaw heads said mark a tuschel who added 
fuel to the furor with a radio spot produced by his chicagobased 
company cw media 
the commercial for little switzerland ski hill a resort near 
milwaukee was aired on chicago radio stations in it an announcer 
tells some people the resort is near milwaukee and the group 
responds with a raspberry 
the announcer then says you dont have to stay there you 
just drive through eliciting a relieved cheer from the group 
tuschel revised the commerical after receiving complaints from 
wisconsinites but he said the attitudes toward milwaukee were not 
of his making 
if you stand on television with a cardboard wedge of cheese on 
your head you almost have it coming he said referring to the 
hats frequently worn by fans at sports events in green bay and 
milwaukee 
bill welch president of the fox valley chamber of commerce 
conceded his office offended some people with its postcard 
campaign which was designed to attract people to fond du lac 
appleton and oshkosh 
the homicidehopscotch postcard compared crime rates between the 
two areas and cited fbi statistics indicating fox valley is among 
the 10 safest regions in the united states 
welch said he enjoyed roykos rebuttal i thought it was kind 
of cute and frankly we appreciated it to our mind anything that 
draws attention to the comparisons works to our benefit 
mary ladish marketing director of the greater milwaukee 
committee said roykos column and the subsequent responses were 
both part of the cultural divide enjoyed by humorists in 
wisconsin and illinois 
ladish said her committee which studies the development of the 
milwaukee metropolitan area isnt concerned with the 
cheesehead jokes 
rather than just talking about image we are working at 
changing milwaukees image through very tangible means she said 
citing efforts to market milwaukee and its festivals businesses 
and restaurants nationwide 
royko said he thought his column was pretty funny and he 
extended his sympathy to people afflicted with the lack of a 
sense of humor 
theyre pretty thinskinned he said you read the column 
and its obvious i wrote it with my tongue partly in my cheek 
wisconsinites take note royko didnt say his tongue was 
entirely in his cheek

a federal appeals court has denied the 
topeka school boards request to rehear its 36yearold 
desegregation case possibly ending more than a decade of 
litigation the plaintiffs attorney said 
richard jones attorney for parents who reopened the brown vs 
topeka board of education case said he received a copy of the 
order from the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver on 
wednesday the decision sided with the plaintiffs 
its good to have it come down he said i think im 
finally seeing the end of the tunnel and theres not a train coming 
our way 
joe zima attorney for the school board said the board received 
the decision thursday but he declined immediate comment 
the 1954 landmark case in which the us supreme court said the 
doctrine of separate but equal had no place in public 
education was reopened in 1979 a group of parents charged that 
the topeka district had not accomplished the racial desegregation 
ordered more than two decades earlier 
in 1987 u s district judge richard rogers of topeka ruled 
that the district had been effectively desegregated the parents 
appealed and last year a threemember panel of the 10th circuit 
overturned rogers ruling 21 
the school board asked for a rehearing and suggested that the 
entire appeals court hear the case both the petition and 
suggestion were denied by the court on monday 
zima said the school boards alternatives are to accept the 
denial or ask the us supreme court to hear the case 
jones said he doesnt expect the board to ask the us supreme 
court to hear the case and that he thought the court would refuse 
to hear it if asked 
what we have had in these last 10 years is kind of a garden 
variety desegregation case jones said we didnt break any new 
ground or come up with any new theories on the law 
he said that if rogers is required to implement a desegregation 
plan for the district it must be agreeable to the plaintiffs

drinking beer paying rent 
buying clothes and furnishing their apartments us soldiers 
account for about 2 billion in annual revenues alone in one west 
german state 
nationwide the more than 250000 gis their family members and 
civilian us military employees spend several times that amount 
each year 
for the tens of thousands of west germans whose livelihoods 
depend on the presence of the us military president bushs troop 
reduction proposal wednesday signaled a possible major shift in 
their lives 
while the yankees arent going home just yet the european 
nation that grew up with us troops is beginning to contemplate an 
end to a large part of their sometimes controversial presence 
the occupation troopsturnedallies are still a daily fact of 
life whether its a fatigueclad gi riding the s4 subway home 
from frankfurt or the young soldiers wife in bitburg learning 
german from her landlord 
cars with the familiar blackandwhite americansize license 
plates crowd the autobahn highways while any simple receiver can 
pick up the militarys afn radio network 
mad king ludwigs neuschwanstein castle faithfully copied 
in disneyland is one of several meccas for soldiers and their 
families every year 
the us military has also been the target of criticism and even 
rage during the antimissile protests of the 1980s and the 
lowlevel training flights that angered civilians 
farmers and villagers complain about tanks on maneuvers tearing 
up fields and crunching pavement deadly collisions occur every 
year 
saturday night brawls involving gis are common especially in 
large cities such as frankfurt 
but in the smaller towns whole economies have grown up around 
the us military bases meaning those municipalities will have an 
even harder time in the event of reduction of tens of thousands of 
troops 
in rhineland palatinate state the us military installations 
have a very important economic meaning says state interior 
ministry spokesman juergen dietzen 
he said 21000 west germans work at us bases in the 
southwestern state which has nostalgic ties with the united states 
because of the massive emigrations decades ago 
in rhineland palatinate alone the number of soldiers is 67000 
while there are 79000 family members and 9000 us civilian 
workers at the bases dietzen said 
they go beer drinking wine drinking they go out to dinner 
buy coats purchase furniture rent apartments dietzen said 
recounting the impact on the economy they are store customers 
and order handcrafts 
dietzen estimated total expenditures by the soldiers themselves 
family members and us support civilians come to more than 2 
billion 
the us military itself kicks in another 400000 to the 
economy in rhineland palatinate he said 
nevertheless state residents are happy to see any reductions to 
help the process of disarmament during improving eastwest 
relations he said in a country with the largest density of troops 
and weapons in western europe disarmament is a popular priority 
officials caution that bushs proposal to bring down the troop 
superpower strength in central europe to 195000 for each side is 
just that a plan wating to discussed and accepted by the soviets 
any withdrawal likely would take years 
cmdr john woodhouse us military spokesman at the european 
command in stuttgart cautions that the numbers have not been 
itemized completely 
virtually all of the central european reductions would come from 
west germany which had nearly 255000 us troops last year 
woodhouse says because only small units are based in belgium and 
the netherlands that could lead to the withdrawal of nearly 60000 
us servicemen from west germany 
woodhouse says the military is starting to look at contingency 
plans if the reductions occur 
but were not at the point yet where we starting to say ok 
this unit youre going to be starting to close down next week 
woodhouse said 
a huge reduction could drastically cut down on the 70000 west 
germans working for the us armed forces 
one town already feeling the pinch is zweibruecken where the 
us air force base with 3500 servicemen recently was targeted for 
shutdown by 1993 even before bushs speech 
the situation is alarming since we have to find substitute 
jobs for the 340 west german civilian workers said thilo huble 
spokesman for the town located in the far southwestern part of the 
country just six miles from france 
like dietzen huble said small businesses will be hurt 
gitta lampersbach a spokesman for the federal labor ministry 
said big layoffs of west german civilian workers would be treated 
like those from private industry triggering financial and 
retraining programs 
in certain areas where the job structure isnt strong that 
could be a real burden on the job market she said 
although west germany is one of the worlds richest countries 
it is struggling to cope with the influx of hundreds of thousands 
of east germans and ethnic germans from other parts of eastern 
europe

on this citys highest point the grave of 
12yearold larisa mamedova has a heros place her brown school 
uniform orange scarf and cheap blue schoolbag piled atop a 
mountain of red carnations 
nearby a young boys grave still unmarked is decorated with 
a pink plastic bear with blue overalls and a few chocolates a 
blackandwhite photo of a roundfaced darkhaired boy of no more 
than 10 is tied with a red ribbon 
on thursday thousands of mourners trudged for hours past a line 
of more than 100 graves dug into a terrace in a hilltop park the 
resting place for those killed when the army stormed baku the 
capital of azerbaijan on jan 20 to put down a nationalist 
uprising 
a moslem mullah recited prayers from a makeshift stand as the 
crowd passed some crying or wailing openly and dropping carnations 
on the graves 
the mourners are defiant reflecting the continuing but 
increasingly hidden conflict between azerbaijanis and the soviet 
military the burial place is formally named kirov park after a 
soviet hero but soon will be renamed in honor of those who died 
for justice said journalist shain hadjiev 
in the pantheon of peoples heroes azerbaijani policeman yusif 
abilgasanov 22 is buried next to boris yefemich 44 and not far 
from a 16yearold jewish girl named vera 
this is already a sacred place said a 35yearold musician 
who identified himself only as bakhtiar the azerbaijani people 
wont forget this and wont forgive anyone 
soviet military officials speaking to the first foreign 
journalists allowed into baku since jan 20 said the army used 
force to take control of the city because there was no other way 
armed activists of azerbaijans peoples front a nationalist 
group blockaded 8000 of more than 11000 soldiers in the area 
with buses and trucks they said we couldnt remove the 
blockades any other way said soviet army spokesman lt gen 
mikhail p kolesnikov 
many of the graves are of young men who were at the barricades 
azerbaijani activists charge the soldiers with indiscriminate 
shooting when they entered the city larisa mamedova they said 
was killed as she sat on a city bus elsewhere in baku her father 
was wounded and died several days later 
according to officials 139 people have died in azerbaijan since 
the soldiers moved in many more were killed in ethnic attacks 
against armenians in baku jan 1314 and in fighting between 
armenians and azerbaijanis throughout the caucasus 
crowds come to the burial place daily but are especially heavy 
on thursdays a traditional time of moslem mourning that lsts for 
40 days after death the mourners wept especially hard when they 
passed the graves of the children 
hadjiev and other activists said soviet tanks entered the city 
from the airport shooting at everything in their way other tanks 
crushed a halfdozen cars in a parking lot as they burst from 
behind a wall of the military arsenal 
the soldiers were a week too late to save armenians who died in 
the ethnic attacks say peoples front activists they blame 
president mikhail s gorbachev for the bloodshed 
nadzhov nadzhavov editor of the banned peoples front 
newspaper said gorbachev gave in to reformist critics by not 
cracking down on separatists in the baltic republic of lithuania 
but appeased conservative critics by allowing the military to take 
baku gorbachevs hands are now bloody he said 
the soviet leader looking tired and defeated in a tv address on 
jan 20 told the nation the soldiers were sent to baku to stop 
attacks on armenians and to control wellarmed fighters 
all our attempts at dialogue with extremists ended like 
this you dont touch us we wont touch you said kolesnikov a 
baku resident 
all of the windows of my apartment house were broken out is 
this dialogue he asked 
red carnations are stuck in bushes next to the park located 
near the presidium of the supreme soviet and down the street from 
the soviet militarys southern command and the kgb offices 
more carnations are strewn at crossroads where azerbaijanis 
died soldiers stand guard there at night with armored personnel 
carriers and military trucks to enforce an 11 pm5 am curfew 
the park also closes for curfew but lights flood the area all 
night hadjiev said soldiers and police dont come near 
bakhtiar the musician said as he left the park after his daily 
visit that azerbaijan has a bright future but without moscow 
asked if he favored full independence for azerbaijan he said

the coded telegram from bolshevik revolutionaries 
reporting the execution of russian czar nicholas ii and his family 
in 1918 has been found in a bank vault among papers left by the 
original investigator of the crime 
the papers hidden in the vault for nearly 70 years will be 
auctioned in london on april 5 sothebys said thursday the 
auction house would not disclose the owners identity or say where 
the papers were concealed 
the owner knew that her uncle called them his dynamite 
papers but until bringing them to us she had no idea of what they 
were said john stuart sothebys consultant on russian art and 
history 
an auction estimate of 500000 to 840000 has been put on the 
papers but stuart remarked what price can you put on them there 
is interest in them everywhere it isnt clear whether the soviet 
government will buy them 
stuart said the owner is a descendant of prince nikolai orlov 
who went into exile in france after the revolution he said orlov 
inherited the papers in 1924 on the death of his fellowexile 
nikolai sokolov the investigator 
sokolov was a lawyer working for the antibolshevik white 
russian forces after the killing of the czars family in the ural 
mountain town of ekaterinburg the white russians overran the area 
and sokolov went to work 
he interrogated everyone he could find about the fate of the 
last members of the romanov dynasty and gathered every scrap of 
paper relating to their last days 
the bolsheviks withdrew so quickly that they failed to take the 
originals of their telegrams at the local telegraph office among 
them was the crucial one of july 17 1918 the day after the royal 
family disappeared 
its coded numbers translate as tell sverdlov the entire 
family suffered the same fate as its head officially the family 
will perish in evacuation 
the message signed by alexander beloborodov chairman of the 
ural soviet and addressed to nikolai gorbunov an official was 
for yankel sverdlov lenins head of state and leader of the cheka 
secret police 
the telegram and the other papers establish beyond doubt in my 
view that the murder of the whole family was directed from moscow 
but the leaders did not want to admit that at the time and claimed 
it was done without their orders said stuart 
the bolsheviks were determined to wipe out every romanov they 
could find and i am convinced that the theories that any of them 
escaped from ekaterinburg are fantasy he said 
sokolovs book about the executions was published in paris in 
1924 it contained reproductions of some of the evidence he 
collected including the telegram 
the discovered files include a steamship bill for the conveyance 
of the royal family for part of the journey to ekaterinburg 
accounts of tips to porters and their guards signatures on pay 
receipts 
there are also photographs of the house of the merchant nikolai 
ipatiev which the bolsheviks took over in the cellar there they 
executed czar nicholas his wife alexandra their five children 
and four servants 
a handwritten note to a chemists shop in ekaterinburg demands 
delivery of 400 pounds of sulfuric acid costing 196 rubles 50 
kopeks equivalent to about 95 before the revolution 
sokolov believed the acid and a large quantity of gasoline were 
used to destroy the bodies 
all the people involved in killing the royal family were 
themselves killed in fighting murders or purges stuart said 
sverdlov was assassinated in 1919 and ekaterinburg was renamed 
sverdlovsk in his memory

a treeplanting ceremony for arbor day is at 
the root of the latest squabble between the left and right branches 
of israeli politics 
israeli lawmakers usually mark the day which this year falls on 
feb 7 by planting trees in a forest near parliament 
but since that forest is fully planted parliament speaker dov 
shilansky of the rightwing likud bloc chose a site near the jewish 
settlement of maale adumim in the occupied west bank 
leftist lawmakers announced a boycott of the ceremony since it 
would be on land occupied in the 1967 middle east war they want to 
trade at least some of that territory for peace with the arabs 
shilansky has suggested a compromise site on mount scopus in 
east jerusalem the arab section of the city annexed by israel 
after the 1967 war 
but the leftists left everybody hanging they say they may hold 
a separate ceremony in pre1967 israel

dr gernot winkler is a government bureaucrat 
with plenty of time on his hands 
winklers offices at the us naval observatory are crowded with 
sundials hourglasses bejeweled antique watches pendulum clocks 
quartz clocks and atomic clocks so incredibly accurate that winkler 
has no excuse for being late to work 
our business is time says winkler 67 an austrianborn 
astronomer and theoretical physicist who has been americas 
official timekeeper for the past 24 years a wellworn scythe the 
familiar emblem of father time is propped up near his desk 
winklers master timepiece is the atomic clock which actually 
consists of 24 boxlike metal instruments housed in eight 
climatecontrolled vaults scattered around the observatorys 
treeshaded grounds on a northwest washington hillside 
each of the faceless clocks contains cesium atoms which when 
heated to a low boil emit faint beams of light from 
electromagnetic radiation at an unchanging frequency of 
9192631770 cycles per second 
every hour computers automatically compare readings from all 
the clocks to produce a uniform time that doesnt vary more than a 
nanosecond onebillionth of a second from day to day some of 
the atomic clocks are accurate to onetenth of a nanosecond 
to set all his clocks winkler relies on a network of radio 
astronomers from hawaii to bologna italy they determine the exact 
position of earth as it rotates on its axis by taking a 
simultaneous fix on some distant star sending signals from the 
depths in space millions of lightyears away 
the precision of the atomic clock seems unbelievable in a world 
weary of wristwatches that suddenly stop and alarm clocks that 
dont ring 
it is so accurate says winkler that its not the clock but the 
rest of the world that goes wrong 
every year or two winkler adds a leap second to the atomic 
clocks time to compensate for a very slow decrease in the earths 
rotation which is thrown slightly out of kilter by winds ocean 
currents earthquakes and even melting snow 
todays master clock is 10 million times more accurate than the 
quaint old pendulum clocks that ticktocked the official time until 
as recently as 1950 when the observatory switched to quartz clocks 
and then eight years later to cesium atomic beam clocks 
nonetheless time doesnt weigh heavy for winkler the way it 
does for the maytag repairman 
no matter how flawlessly his atomic clocks run he says he must 
keep trying to shave off another millisecond here or there to meet 
the increasingly sophisticated demands of electronic navigation and 
communications systems from deeprunning nuclear submarines to 
satellites beaming weather advisories to airports 
we dont wait for something to happen he said we need to 
be in the forefront of technological capabilities if we didnt 
wed be as obsolete as the pendulum clock in three to five years 
already he says a possible successor to the atomic clock is a 
new device that employs ions or electrically charged atoms of 
mercury that are trapped in an electromagnetic bottle and 
produce a fluorescent glow with a much higher frequency than cesium 
beams 
when hes not busy perfecting his clocks and keeping an eye on 
the observatorys timeofday announcements by telephone dial 
1900410time winkler says he answers an occasional piece of 
nut mail about the time 
like the guy who asked what actually happens to the time you 
waste or the request for an exact definition of a moment 
a womans letter one of winklers favorites inquired what 
god did with his time before he created the world 
i wrote back that he invented hell for people who ask stupid 
questions he said

a new report says the number of americans 
becoming infected annually with the virus that causes aids is 
declining although the number of new aids cases will continue 
rising until 1995 
the reports author peter plumley a consulting actuary in 
chicago also says the chances that a heterosexual not using drugs 
intravenously will become infected are remote and that aids 
prevention efforts focus too much on this group 
plumley writes in the januaryfebruary issue of contingencies 
magazine that the number of new annual infections with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv peaked in 1986 and is going down 
however he says the total number of hivinfected americans will 
continue to rise until 1991 when 14 million will be infected 
also the number of new aids cases will continue to rise until 
1995 and then begin to decline and the number of aids deaths will 
peak at around 110000 in 1997 plumleys projections show 
years can elapse between the time of infection with hiv and the 
onset of aids no one is known to have recovered from aids 
he predicted that by the year 2000 there will have been a total 
of 13 million aids cases and about 11 million aids deaths 
his figures do not include hiv infections and aids cases among 
blood transfusion recipients hemophiliacs and children which 
account for about 5 percent of the total infections 
as of dec 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 117781 
americans sixty percent or 70313 had died since june 1 1981 
according to the federal centers for disease control 
the cdc which estimates that about 1 million people in the 
united states are hivinfected now is revising its projections for 
future spread of the disease 
a draft report released earlier this month predicted that 
projections for the numbers of cases will be about 15 percent lower 
than previous cdc estimates 
cdc spokeswoman gayle lloyd said until the agency issues new 
projections no one here is interested in talking about anyone 
elses projections 
plumley said one of the most disturbing aspects of the aids 
epidemic is the number of people who have become concerned 
unnecessarily about the epidemic 
the virus is spread mainly through contact with bodily fluids 
including sexual intercourse particularly anal sex and sharing of 
needles its chief victims have been homosexual males and 
intravenous drug users 
a homosexual males risk of contracting aids is about 1 in 500 
according to plumley but the risk for a heterosexual engaging in 
vaginal sex is less than one in a million providing their sex 
partners are not from a highrisk group 
prevention efforts within the homosexual bisexual and 
intravenous drug user communities should continue but valid 
reasons exist to attempt to temper warnings issued to people whose 
risks are as remote as one in a million or less 
hyperbole could divert the focus from the truly serious areas 
of risk damage credibility of the prevention efforts and create 
paranoia among those who dont understand and jeopardize their 
chances of forming the kinds of relationships necessary to health 
and wellbeing he wrote

rep gus savage made improper advances to 
a peace corps volunteer during a trip to zaire last march 
violating a house rule on members conduct according to a house 
ethics committee report 
however the committee took no action to punish the chicago 
democrat citing a voluntary letter of apology he wrote to the 
woman according to the unreleased report obtained thursday by the 
associated press 
had the congressman not taken the initiative to send such a 
letter the committee would have directed that he do so the 
report said the report also noted the panel has not previously 
considered a members conduct during an official visit to a foreign 
country 
the panel formally the committee on standards of official 
conduct concluded that rep savages sexual advances were 
contrary to a rule requiring members conduct to reflect 
creditably on the house 
savage who is black contended in a house speech to a nearly 
empty chamber thursday that the committee was declining to pursue 
the case adding he received not even a slap on the wrist he 
did not mention the letter of apology 
according to an interview the unnamed woman gave the committee 
last september savage took the volunteer on a tour of night spots 
in kinshasa zaire placed his hand on her leg and thigh and tried 
to persuade her to have sex with him 
she recalled that he stated as he was pulling her over to 
him that one should be prepared to give their all to the movement 
and if one is not prepared to do so they are not really members 
of the black movement but are rather traitors to it the report 
said 
savage described the allegations as a racist attack by white 
government officials and the whiteowned news media and called the 
three house democrats who filed a complaint against him 
selfappointed guardians of personal morality 
the three reps patricia schroeder of colorado matthew mchugh 
of new york and barney frank of massachusetts had no comment 
while the ethics panel did not recommend any punishment and will 
not pursue the case to the trial stage the report said the 
committee concluded rep savage subjected a peace corps volunteer 
to improper advances during his visit to kinshasa zaire last 
march 19 
the report added savage has acknowledged that he may have 
acted inappropriately as evidenced by his letter to the woman in 
an interview with the committee before the letter was written 
however the report said savage denied her allegations 
the committee said it was placing other house members on 
notice that similar conduct would be viewed with the clear 
possibility that additional action might be pursued 
savages letter to the woman said in part while in zaire 
earlier this year if you felt personally offended by any words or 
actions of mine i apologize because i never intended to offend 
and was not aware that you felt offended at that time 
the woman was included in a party of us officials that met 
with savage because she was from his district the report said 
according to the report the volunteer said savage took her on a 
tour of night spots in a chauffeurdriven car with no other 
passengers 
the volunteer stated that soon after the car began to 
move rep savage grabbed her around the shoulders and tried to 
pull her up against him the committee report said 
the volunteer pushed him away the report said and she 
indicated that the congressman pulled her up against him grabbed 
her face and forced her to kiss him she stated that she was very 
frightened was pushing rep savage away but that he was not 
listening and did not stop 
after visiting a night spot according to the report savage

president bushs claims to be charting a 
program of excellence in education are under swift and heavy 
attack as being unrealistic with only a 2 percent education budget 
increase to back them up 
bush was heading to universities in north carolina and tennessee 
today to promote the national education goals he announced in his 
state of the union address wednesday night 
at north carolina state university the president was visiting a 
semiconductor lab and holding a roundtable discussion on 
competitiveness 
later his itinerary was taking him to the university of 
tennessee 
the president came under attack from democrats and education 
groups almost as soon as he announced the goals for improvement in 
students math and science achievement literacy and drugfree 
schools 
there is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of president 
bushs education speeches and the funding levels he offers in his 
budget said albert shanker president of the american federation 
of teachers 
the presidents words about making american workers the most 
productive in the world by the year 2000 are right on the mark 
said stephen blair president of the national association of trade 
and technical schools 
however he said the hard reality is his 1991 budget 
will deprive thousands of young americans of their chance for 
quality postsecondary education particularly in urgently needed 
technical fields he said the budget plan would dramatically 
reduce program funding for postsecondary education 
the critics also demand to know where the money would come from 
to slash the dropout rate and make us children tops in math and 
science by the year 2000 as bush seeks 
in his 1991 budget proposal on monday bush sought 500 million 
2 percent more for the education department he also requested 
an extra 500 million for head start which is in the department of 
health and human services budget 
education secretary lauro f cavazos on thursday defended 
bushs plan saying its not a matter of dollars 
we could keep on adding another billion and another 
billion that is not going to solve the education deficit 
cavazos told reporters 
the way math and science is taught must be radically changed he 
said just putting more dollars into the current system is not 
going to make good mathematicians of students said cavazos 
however he also said the education departments proposed 246 
billion budget for fiscal 1991 is the largest education budget 
that this nation has had with a very healthy 62 percent 
increase in discretionary programs 
but richard miller executive director of the american 
association of school administrators urged bush to get beyond 
rhetoric his budget proposal for education is at odds with the 
goals 
cavazos said american students are in last place in performance 
on math and science compared with children in other industrialized 
nations 
bushs education goals follow on the education summit he held 
with the 50 governors in charlottesville va where they agreed to 
come up with such performance goals 
the national governors association is to vote on the end 
product at its winter meeting at the end of this month 
meanwhile the bush administration opened a lobbying campaign 
for its proposals to cut the capital gains tax and boost personal 
savings with chief of staff john sununu accusing democrats of 
being the party of taxes 
sununu rebuked democrats for failing to join republicans in 
giving bush a standing ovation during the state of the union 
address wednesday when bush said the federal budget could be 
balanced with no new taxes 
democrats bristled at sununus attack and house speaker thomas 
foley dwash told reporters his party agrees something needs to 
be done about americas plummeting savings rate but rejects bushs 
tax cut

as congress probes deeper into new farm 
legislation the federal crop insurance corp and its mission to 
help protect farmers against losses from drought and other natural 
disasters is drawing a lot of criticism 
the bush administration wants to eliminate the halfcenturyold 
fcic coverage in favor of some kind of permanent disaster program 
farmer acceptance of the insurance program is lukewarm and costly 
moreover every time there is a serious drought flood or other 
threat to crops congress comes up with a relief measure and many 
say that makes fcic operations unnecessary 
one of the recommendations in the budget proposals president 
bush sent to congress this week was the elimination of federal crop 
insurance starting with the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
the bush proposal would include enough money in the 1991 fiscal 
year to finish off 1990 insurance operations some 430 million 
against outlays of 118 billion in 1990 but would put an end to 
new coverage 
according to an agriculture department budget analysis the fcic 
has not been able to provide adequate risk protection for farmers 
at a reasonable cost to taxpayers 
the department added further ad hoc disaster legislation was 
enacted in both 1988 and 1989 the administration will work closely 
with congress to fashion a permanent disaster assistance program 
which can provide an effective safety net for farmers and 
ranchers 
in the document submitted by bush the office of management and 
budget included figures showing how the fcic has operated the 
agency was created on feb 16 1938 to provide a sound system of 
crop insurance for farmers the document said 
but for the crop years 1948 through 1988 the budget document 
said the fcic paid out indemnities totaling nearly 489 billion 
while collecting premiums of 313 billion making a loss ratio 
of 156 
in other words farmers collected 156 in benefits for each 1 
in premium payments during those 40 years 
the actuarial figures are based on crop years instead of fiscal 
years so the expenditures and benefits dont match exactly crop 
years vary with wheat barley and oats beginning on june 1 corn 
sorghum and soybeans oct 1 and cotton peanuts and rice aug 1 
as an example of fcic operations under current law the white 
house report showed that for 1991 crop years farmers would pay 
premiums of about 5079 million the premium subsidies would add 
1693 million making a total premium of 6773 million 
the projections show indemnities paid out for losses could be 
more than 1 billion in the 1991 crop years making a loss ratio of 
15 the same as the level expected in 1990 but below the 17 of 
1989 
because the federal subsidy is part of the total premium the 
loss ratio actually understates the real cost to taxpayers 
according to usda analysts 
although the white house document and the usda backup analysis 
make it clear the fcic should be scrapped entirely there has been 
some opposition voiced already on capitol hill 
sen quentin burdick dnd whose state has been hit severely 
by drought the last couple of years said the insurance proposal 
is a case of the president throwing out the baby with the bath 
water 
burdick added the present crop insurance program isnt 
perfect but we need to provide some sort of federal assistance for 
farmers struck by weatherrelated disasters 
sen bob kerrey dneb said bushs proposal failed to include 
money for a permanent emergency aid program to replace crop 
insurance 
farmers will not engage in this trapeze act with the 
administration because they recognize that the safety net is made 
of promises he said they will not be deceived by the sleight 
of hand 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the bush proposal 
leaves more room for negotiation with congress than some of the 
critics have indicated 
in other words what we say in this budget is that we need to 
deal with this issue in whatever way seems most appropriate after 
we have a full debate on the subject he said youve all heard 
me say that we need to go to one program or the other we cannot 
afford to go to two 
the conclusion within the administration is that the crop 
insurance program as it presently exists is simply not 
defensible yeutter said 
we are not suggesting that there be neither program in 
existence he said we are prepared to work with the congress 
in finding the proper solution and fashioning it and then trying 
to find the money to fund it somewhere somehow 
yeutter is expected to be questioned closely next week when he 
appears before the senate agriculture committee to present the 
administrations view on 1990 farm legislation 
although yeutter has said the administration will not have a 
formal bill as such he may opt to present outlines of some of the 
portions that will be covered if there is a plan for crop 
insurance or an alternative disaster program the session with 
senate lawmakers on feb 7 might be a good place to unveil it

what soviet jamming failed to do us budget 
cuts are managing as of april 1 the voice of america is 
eliminating six of its 43 language services 
the move which will affect devotees of american radio from 
uzbekistan to malawi will cost 57 people their jobs 
eliminating the turkish greek lao uzbek slovenian and 
swahili broadcasts is expected to save the governments radio 
network 29 million 
this is the toughest and saddest day of my professional 
life voa director richard w carlson told hundreds of 
broadcasters editors and engineers thursday 
after announcing the cuts carlson read the names of each of the 
employees who will lose their jobs many of them have worked for 
voa for over 20 years 
vilified for years as a tool of us propaganda jammed by 
soviet frequencies throughout the world the voice of america has 
been reaching the far corners of the world with news and 
entertainment programs for 42 years 
but for the past four years voa has been grappling with an 
eroding budget inflation and real cuts have forced the station to 
fire more than 200 people shut down five bureaus in the united 
states and abroad and eliminate hundreds of radio hours 
this time voa and its parent the us information agency 
decided on amputation of whole language services rather than 
dismemberment by across the board cuts this way carlson said 
voa will have 37 healthy services and not 43 crippled ones 
debate about voas budget needs is scheduled in congress later 
this month as critics are questioning whether the new order in 
eastern europe have made voa redundant 
but carlson said voa also broadcasts to china cambodia africa 
and other areas of strife voa also argues its mission in europe is 
more important than ever in helping the formerly oneparty nations 
learn about democracy 
the people in this room helped shape the revolution in 
europe carlson told the employees this will cripple our 
efforts at a time of unprecedented change and opportunity 
the selection of the services to be eliminated was made 
according to priorities that take into account the political 
importance of the targeted countries and the availability of other 
foreign media there 
elimination of the slovenian service comes during unprecedented 
ferment in the yugoslav republic by residents eager to reform the 
communist system but most slovenians speak serbocroatian and voa 
still has a service in that language carlson said slovenians also 
have access to the british broadcasting corporations world service 
uzbeks in the soviet union and in afghanistan and china can 
listen to the bbcs uzbek service the bbc also has turkish and 
greek programs 
impoverished communist laos is the only country that will no 
longer hear foreign broadcasts once the voas lao service is 
eliminated 
voas operating budget for 1990 is about 170 million and the 
budget for next year is expected to be 174 million carlson said 
this includes a 35 percent wage increase and still leaves voa 15 
million short 
the problems were compounded this week when the administrations 
1991 budget proposal called for the addition of a tibetan language 
service voa officials estimate it will cost 15 million to air 
two hours a week of tibetan programs 
if we dont get budget relief im afraid were looking at 
more cuts carlson said in an interview

gov george mickelson recognizing the 
historical hurt suffered by indians smoked a peace pipe with 
tribal leaders and proclaimed a year of reconciliation in 1990 a 
century after the wounded knee massacre 
the governor and representatives of eight sioux tribes drew 
deeply and passed the pipe thursday as they sat in a circle around 
a buffalo skull and other items in the center of the state capitol 
rotunda 
the members of the south dakota legislature and hundreds of 
other spectators applauded as mickelson and the tribal leaders 
completed the ceremony they then signed a proclamation designating 
1990 as a time for healing wounds that have festered between 
indians and nonindians for a century 
during the states centennial celebration last year indians 
refused to take part claiming they had nothing to celebrate they 
have been at odds with state government over issues such as hunting 
and fishing rights law enforcement on reservation highways and 
contracts for state services 
the governor decided it was time to bury the tomahawk 
mickelson said he gathered the state lawmakers and the indian 
leaders together to make this truly a year of reconciliation that 
marks a new beginning 
i believe it places a responsibility on all of us throughout 
this year to make a personal commitment the governor said 
indians are going through especially tough times in the state 
on south dakotas nine reservations unemployment approaches 80 
percent and alcoholism drugs and health care are severe problems 
four reservation counties rank among the nations very poorest 
in terms of per capita income 
tim giago publisher of the weekly lakota times had challenged 
mickelson to proclaim 1990 as a year to help ease racial discord 
between indian and white people in south dakota mickelson thanked 
the indian publisher for issuing the challenge 
in the proclamation mickelson said that as south dakota begins 
its second century of statehood people must also remember that the 
creation of the state was a sad time for indians 
in december 1890 a little more than a year after south dakota 
became a state sioux leader sitting bull was killed and nearly 300 
sioux men women and children were killed by us government troops 
in the wounded knee massacre 
strife between the cultures in south dakota has for 100 
years been of grave concern and continues to be of grave 
concern the governor said in the proclamation 
the 100th anniversary of the tragic events offers an opportunity 
for indians and nonindians to put aside their fears and mistrust 
build friendships cooperate learn about each others culture and 
develop a respect and understanding that will grow in the next 
century mickelson said 
more than 6 percent of the states population or about 45000 
people are indians according to the 1980 us census 
mickelson said he realizes state government and the tribal 
governments wont settle all their disputes in the next year but 
many of the problems might be resolved 
a council of indians and nonindians should put together a broad 
plan by march 1 for celebrating the year of reconciliation the 
governor said and each south dakotan should think about ways to 
bridge the cultural gap between indians and nonindians in the long 
run 
the proclamation was signed by the governor and representatives 
of the flandreausantee sioux oglala sioux rosebud sioux yankton 
sioux standing rock sioux cheyenne river the lower brule tribe 
and the sissetonwahpeton sioux tribe a crow creek sioux 
representative didnt show up for the ceremony but officials said 
a tribal representative may sign it later 
the ceremony opened when two sioux men sang the lakota flag 
song in a highpitched haunting wavering harmony and sioux 
military veterans carried in the us flag a sioux eagle staff 
adorned with feathers and other flags 
it ended with the sioux men singing the peace song

maximum civil fraud damages awarded under the 
nations major antiracketeering law would be cut under a bill 
approved by the senate judiciary committee and now ready for floor 
action 
the bill won 112 approval on thursday with sponsors complaining 
that attorneys have used the law designed as a tool against 
organized crime in ordinary fraud cases thus thwarting the will 
of congress 
it didnt intend for federal judges to be using treble damages 
in divorce decree cases and landlordtenant cases said sen 
dennis deconcini dariz the chief sponsor 
the committee acted despite complaints from consumer groups that 
the bill would weaken a tool needed to deter unscrupulous 
businessmen from robbing the public through whitecollar fraud 
schemes 
fraud victims currently can sue for triple damages under the 
1970 racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
investors who lost thousands of dollars by purchasing bonds 
through the nowdefunct lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
have filed a rico suit against an array of civil defendants 
including the accountants who gave the institution a clean bill of 
financial health 
deconcinis bill would enable consumers to seek punitive damages 
up to twice actual damages plus attorneys fees attempting to 
collect however would mean facing a second court action following 
a trial 
the bill would require those seeking such damages to show 
clear and convincing evidence of fraud rather than the 
preponderance of the evidence often used in civil cases they 
also would have to prove that the defendants actions were 
consciously malicious or so egregious and deliberate that malice 
may be implied 
consumers would be limited to actual damages without attorneys 
fees in cases involving securities or commodity futures the limit 
would not however apply to insider trading violations 
proponents say a landslide of rico suits in recent years is 
enriching attorneys and thwarting the will of congress 
broad language that may be appropriate against the mafia can 
be abused when used in a gardenvariety fraud case chairman 
joseph r biden jr ddel told the judiciary committee 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio told the panel the bill is 
wanting and that he would oppose the measure on the floor 
the original bill would have been retroactive and thus would 
have wiped out pending lawsuits such as the one in the lincoln sampl 
case deconcini dropped that feature as he pushed for wider 
support but there have been hints that it might be restored on the 
floor 
sen paul simon dill backed the bill but told the committee 
he would oppose it on the floor if the retroactive feature were 
restored 
deconcini said he has been subjected to attacks that i am 
doing this for reasons of a savings and loan in arizona there is 
no basis in that 
he is one of five senators under investigation by the senate 
ethics committee concerning their contacts with federal regulators 
in the 2 billion lincoln savings collapse 
sen orrin hatch rutah a cosponsor of the bill deplored 
reprehensible attacks on deconcini in the press and by members 
of both political parties 
biden said deconcini had been in favor of such a measure long 
before the lincoln case surfaced 
outside the committee room william lerach an attorney for the 
suing lincoln bondholders said the committees action could be a 
setback for those already involved in court actions under rico

democrats are pressing the bush administration 
to push for deeper cuts in us and soviet forces in europe beyond 
the presidents proposal to reduce significantly the superpowers 
combat troops 
several members of the senate armed services committee said the 
united states should not stand pat once a conventional arms control 
pact is reached and adopt bushs level of 225000 troops for each 
side as the residual total 
it wont take long for the allies to grab all the reductions 
and were going to be sitting over there with a us army and 
virtually no allies and a questionable threat sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the committee told defense secretary dick 
cheney on thursday 
now that would be a curious position nunn said 
hours after bushs surprise announcement in his state of the 
union speech wednesday night cheney told the committee the soviet 
union is likely to withdraw all its troops from europe by the 
middle of the decade 
cheney estimated the 225000 us troop level in europe could be 
achieved within a year or two certainly after an agreement is 
ratified but he said the troops would be sent elsewhere and not 
removed from military service 
however the defense secretary cautioned against a unilateral 
pullout saying it is important to maintain the nato alliance and 
ensure a peaceful withdrawal 
the soviet union remains the only nation on earth capable of 
destroying the united states cheney said adding that even if 
all soviet troops leave eastern europe moscow would retain its 
geographic advantage in the event of a european crisis 
he said it was important not to drop below a certain troop level 
in europe 
sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
committee sought and received an assurance from cheney that the 
administration would not consider going beyond bushs latest 
troopcut proposal in the foreseeable future 
this is the worst possible time to contemplate changes in 
strategy warner said 
but sen alan dixon dill pressed cheney about why the 
administration would wait for an arms control pact before reducing 
troops in light of moves by allies to cut their forces and 
pressures in the eastern bloc for the soviets to leave 
theyre going to get out of eastern europe whether they like 
it or not without any agreement with the united states theyre 
going to kick them out dixon said and were waiting here to 
do things until we have the agreement 
im not saying strip until were naked im saying do sensible 
things now here in our country even without agreements he 
said 
cheney said the administration recognizes the need to reduce 
us forces overseas and has in fact begun to cut back with plans 
to end us operations at several foreign bases 
we are now on the verge of winning one of the greatest 
victories in the history of the world without a shot ever being 
fired the defense secretary said 
cheney and gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff also used their appearance before the panel to defend the 
administrations 2921 billion military budget for fiscal 1991 
the spending plan would increase spending for the b2 stealth 
bomber the strategic defense initiative and two landbased 
nuclear missiles but cancels some 20 small weapons systems 
the belief that i have is that it is out of balance sen 
carl levin dmich said referring to the terminations of 
conventional programs and the increase for nuclear weapons 
the budget said levin only partially responds to the 
lessening soviet threat 
sen edward kennedy dmass wondered why it was necessary to 
spend money for so many strategic weapons at this madcap pace 
cheney said the decision to cancel the weapons programs was 
based on the high number of existing weapons and the savings from 
shutting down production lines modernization however must not be 
abandoned because the soviets continue to upgrade their class of 
hightech weapons 
sen trent lott rmiss said the defense secretary may have 
gone too far in light of the likely cuts the congress may make in 
the budget 
you might be getting too caught up in this experience lott

its a conductors nightmare the orchestra is in 
the middle of a moving passage when suddenly from high in the 
balcony a member of the audience is convulsed by a hacking cough 
it happens all too often according to conductors at 21 
orchestras surveyed about noisy disturbances during their 
performances 
nineteen of the 23 conductors who answered the survey said they 
have been distracted by audience noises while conducting 
coughers are the worst they said 
a lot of times these people get these hacking coughs and just 
let them fly and thats when it gets annoying said george 
hanson resident conductor at the atlanta symphony 
jesus lopezcobos musical director of the cincinnati symphony 
orchestra said he has seen musicians struggling to stifle laughter 
during a particularly obnoxious bout of coughing 
when i feel that it is an evening when people are coughing too 
much i try in between the movements to leave a little more time so 
that the people have the time to cough or whatever lopezcobos 
said 
the coughing is most prevalent during the current cold and flu 
season hanson said but conductors also sniff over audience noises 
talking and yammering youngsters were problems no 2 and 3 on 
the most distracting sounds list 
kenneth jean associate conductor of the chicago symphony 
orchestra said thursday that many audience noises are signals that 
people are getting fidgety 
and he said thats televisions mark 
were used to every 14 minutes having a commercial break 
said jean also music director of the florida symphony orchestra 
jean said that in looking through old chicago symphony orchestra 
program books from the 1940s he found programs up to three hours 
long which todays audience would probably find intolerable 
todays concerts last about two hours with intermission he 
said even then some in the audience are sound asleep with a 
snore here and there 
how do conductors get quiet 
warnerlambert co which sponsored the survey is distributing 
free waxwrapped halls cough tablets to patrons of the 21 
orchestras whose conductors were surveyed the company finished 
compiling the survey this week 
its part of the second year of a promotion called silent 
nights at the symphony 
jean said the free cough drops do more than soothe scratchy 
throats its like waving a flag to say look guys we have a 
problem with noise 
some performers are more direct 
ive known of occasions where performers conductors or 
soloists have stopped waited glowered at the audience to bring 
things under control said albert webster executive vice 
president and managing director of the new york philharmonic 
but hanson cautioned that orchestras must be careful not to shoo 
away patrons who already may consider symphony concerts a tad 
highbrow 
we dont want to scare people away by making them think that 
if they drop their concert program on the floor theyre going to be 
shunned for life hanson said

more than 700 scientists including 49 winners 
of the nobel prize are accusing president bush of being complacent 
about the threat of global warming and urging him to show greater 
leadership on the issue 
the scientists representing a broad range of disciplines from 
medicine to physics said in a letter thursday to bush that while 
more research on global warming is necessary uncertainty is 
no excuse for complacency 
in view of the potential consequences actions to curb the 
introduction of greenhouse gases must be initiated immediately 
only by taking action now can we ensure that future generations 
will not be put at risk said the scientists 
the group represented more than onethird of all members of the 
national academy of sciences among them were 49 nobel laureates 
and 64 recipients of the national medal of science 
next week a new round of meetings is to be opened in washington 
of the intergovernmental panel on climate change which is 
examining the global warming issue 
the meeting expected to be attended by representatives from 
more than 60 countries is part of an effort to reach an 
international agreement perhaps next year on what to do about 
global warming 
environmentalists have chided bush for failing to endorse 
specific reductions in socalled greenhouse gases especially 
carbon dioxide some european countries have argued that industrial 
nations should commit themselves to at least a 20 percent reduction 
of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 
but the bush administration has said such a commitment is unwise 
because the economic impact has yet to be fully understood any 
significant reduction in global warming gases would require a major 
reduction in industrys reliance on fossil fuels such as coal and 
oil 
carbon dioxide primarily from the burning of fossil fuels 
accounts for about half of all greenhouse gases worldwide the 
united states accounts for onefifth of all greenhouse gas 
emissions 
the letter was circulated among the scientific community by the 
union of concerned scientists which has been critical of the 
administrations policy on global warming most of the scientists 
who signed the appeal are not members of the group however 
sen albert gore dtenn who has been a vocal critic of the 
administrations global warming policy called the scientists 
letter to bush an extremely powerful statement by an impressive 
group and said it removes any misimpression of the position of 
the scientific community on the issue 
while there is widespread agreement among scientists that 
manmade pollution is causing a warming of the earth there is 
disagreement over how severe that warming will be and what the 
effect it will have on the earth 
some scientists have said the earths temperature could increase 
anywhere from 4 to 9 degrees by the middle of the next century 
warming along the upper range of that estimate would cause serious 
coastal flooding and droughts scientists say 
also on thursday the international energy agency released a 
report suggesting that any measures to deal with global warming are 
likely to be difficult and expensive although no specific cost 
estimates were provided 
it is clear that the economic costs of meaningful 
countermeasures will be very heavy concluded the iea study 
effective economic and technical adjustments will have to be 
introduced gradually over years and even decades

interior secretary manuel lujan jr is 
getting unexpected praise from one of the harshest critics of 
republican environmental policies in recent years 
house interior committee chairman morris udall who was 
regularly at odds with the reagan administration said in a letter 
sent thursday to lujan that he sees an encouraging policy shift 
in the direction of the department of the interior and its 
management of coal mining activities 
steve goldstein chief spokesman for lujan said the letter came 
as a surprise 
we have been plugging along for 12 months trying to get people 
to notice that things are different at interior and there is an 
environmental tilt he said 
goldstein said lujan decided to reverse several reagan 
administration decisions because they did not fit into the 
environmental mandate the secretary and president bush want the 
department to follow 
there is a much greater focus on stewardship in this 
administration said goldstein 
critics including udall have said the reagan administration 
favored private interests over public concerns 
udall who is in his 13th year as chairman of the interior 
committee often fought with interior secretaries james watt and 
donald hodel who served under reagan 
a former congressman lujan served on the interior committee 
where he was the ranking republican for several years 
we sat side by side for a good number of years udall 
commented thursday we both know well disagree again along the 
way but when an old friend is doing a good job i feel moved to 
tell him 
environmental groups also have praise for lujans leadership 
a lot of it is that they are waking up to the political 
realities that the public is interested in having the environment 
protected said skip deegans spokesman for the national wildlife 
federation the situation on coal issues was so antagonistic 
during the reagan administration that nothing was getting done we 
were constantly in litigation with the office of surface mining 
udall who sponsored the surface mining control and reclamation 
act cited five areas for praise 
improvements in the computerized system designed to prevent 
violators of the act from obtaining additional mining permits the 
reagan administration was put under court order to make 
improvements but never did said deegans 
abolishing a reagan proposal to reduce the royalty rate paid 
the government on underground coal it would have saved the coal 
industry money but cost the taxpayers 
reversal of a reagan administration decision to eliminate 
certain fees from the royalty base rate paid on coal that had cost 
taxpayers about 70 million said udall 
disapproval a change in a wyoming regulatory program that would 
have relieved coal companies of having to return surfacemined 
lands to their original contours 
action to stop mining companies from abusing the law that 
allows coal to be taken at a cheaper rate if the company happens to 
mine it when looking for another mineral in the vicinity companies 
were pretending to be mining principally for cheaper minerals in 
order to get coal said udall

politburo member yegor k ligachev viewed by many 
soviets as a hardline conservative has come under unusually harsh 
attack by a newspaper that accuses him of lying and clinging to 
outdated socialist ideals 
the weekly moscow news which has been at the forefront of 
glasnost or openness broke a taboo on criticizing standing soviet 
rulers with a long editorial saying ligachev opposes democracy and 
deceives the people 
a picture accompanying the editorial underscored the critical 
tone it showed the 69yearold silverhaired ligachev giving a 
nazilike salute with one armed stretched above his head at a 
45degree angle 
the article in editions released thursday also accused 
ligachev of a wide range of sins such as glorifying dictator josef 
stalin and disregarding the peoples will 
the article was unusual not only for its harsh criticism of a 
soviet leader but also for its timing just five days before the 
communist partys powerful central committee of which ligachev is 
a member holds what is expected to be a stormy session 
progressives hope to present an alternative platform and rumors 
are rife that hardliners might try to make a power play 
the editorial on ligachev was given great prominence it was 
splashed over two pages and carried a measure of authority 
because it was written by a deputy editorinchief vitaly 
tretyakov 
the article outlined the views that have earned ligachev an 
ethnic russian a conservative label and frequently put him on a 
slower more orthodox track than the reformminded party leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
ligachev repeatedly has denied any discord with gorbachev and 
has rejected the conservative label 
while many reformers are calling for a multiparty political 
system ligachev has emphasized preserving the communist partys 
exclusive hold on power and has warned that glasnost should not 
obscure the achievements of seven decades of communist rule 
he has firmly ruled out ownership of private property and has 
defended state and collective farms which critics say contribute 
to the dismal performance of soviet agriculture 
tretyakov wrote that gorbachevs reform program perestroika 
has turned ligachev from a supporter of the countrys progress to 
an opponent 
he said ligachev apparently believes the communists not the 
people at large are the partys source of power and in doing so 
obviously diverges from the spirit of the day 
portraying ligachev as an opponent of democracy tretyakov said 
his idea of pluralism is to accept only conflicting opinions from 
people who support socialism 
he questioned ligachevs approach to socialism saying he favors 
what is the most unhealthy in socialism 
the politburo member also holds to a myth of unity of the 
party the country the model of socialism 
such unity never was even when it was violently supported by 
a stalinist regime tretyakov wrote 
the solutions ligachev and other conservatives propose he said 
arise not from the achievements of the past but from the 
mistakes 
he criticized conservatives for acknowledging that stalins 
repression was wrong but claiming that he saved the soviet union 
from defeat to the nazis in world war ii in fact tretyakov said 
it could be argued that stalin made the country vulnerable to 
attack and that it was saved in spite of not because of the 
dictator 
conservatives he said believe communism will be built im 
afraid on the blood shed not only in 1937 but also in 1989 in 
tbilisi he referred to the height of stalins bloody campaign of 
terror in the 1930s and a soviet army attack on proindependence 
demonstrators in the georgian capital last april

when sen jesse helms the conservative 
republican from north carolina called mikhail gorbachev a 
colorful and adroit public relations man at a senate hearing he 
found himself alone 
none of helms foreign relations committee colleagues endorsed 
the senators charge thursday that the soviet leaders reform 
program excludes freedom 
secretary of state james a baker iii sat placidly in the 
witness chair and let the criticism of the soviet president pass 
although he did tell helms he would ask in moscow next week about 
allegations the soviets are sending new weapons to nicaragua and 
cuba 
baker had just finished reading a statement endorsing the 
reformers in moscow pledging us technical and other support 
and warning 
if we fail to support the principles that brought us this far 
we could end up living in a future that resembles the past the 
past of cold war and the conflicts that preceded it 
a year ago helmss reservations might have been echoed by the 
administration 
president bush held out for months against responding to 
gorbachevs overtures for troop reductions in europe he did not 
reply until june and only wednesday night in his state of the 
union speech sweetened his offer of last year to get down to 
275000 on each side 
reflecting the reality that the red army could be out of 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland before a treaty is concluded 
bush called for further cuts ceilings of 225000 with a limit of 
195000 us and soviet soldiers in central europe 
a year ago on bakers first trip to europe his closest aides 
were advising reporters that the us allies shared the view that 
gorbachev was adept at public relations and had converted us 
proposals for easing tensions to his own use 
all that has changed now 
one of those same aides acknowledged wednesday night that the 
democratic revolutions in eastern europe had created new 
realities if there was any resistance to bushs latest proposal 
to cut us and soviet forces it would come from the western 
allies not moscow 
baker who will hold talks in the soviet capital next thursday 
and friday with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and 
possibly gorbachev was unqualified in his support for the soviet 
leader 
we seek to probe for points of mutual advantage with the 
soviet union he told the foreign relations committee turning 
areas of conflict into areas of cooperation wherever possible in 
this way we will benefit ourselves as well as the reformers in 
moscow 
some of the democrats urged the bush administration to move 
faster 
sen joseph r biden jr of delaware for instance is keen on 
gorbachevs proposal to hold a 35nation summit meeting next year 
biden said it would be a good opportunity to discuss the 
elimination of all foreign forces from europe 
bakers response was to give the idea qualified support first 
he would want the troop reduction treaty completed and he would 
want the soviets to recognize free elections as a human right 
but baker was receptive and he is expected to develop the theme 
during his trip next week to czechoslovakia and the soviet union 
he also may be able to work out with shevardnadze answers to 
some of the questions still in the way of a ussoviet treaty to 
reduce longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
and with the soviet foreign minister baker will be looking for 
a solution to the war in afghanistan between the marxist government 
and usbacked guerrillas 
on several fronts slow to act at first the bush administration 
is finding the gorbachev revolution irresistible

federal agents probing a series of mail 
bombs have interviewed three welders about their relationship with 
a salvage store owner under investigation in the case 
the welders said thursday that the fbi agents mainly wanted to 
know about their ties to robert wayne oferrell for whom all have 
done work one welder said agents took nail samples from his shop 
the fbi which established an outpost in this southeast alabama 
community nearly two weeks ago has declined to comment about 
specifics of the case 
parttime welder james locke of nearby new brockton said he told 
two investigators that hes known oferrell about four years and 
has occasionally done work for him repairing such salvage store 
items as metal chairs desks and shelves 
locke said the agents took some samples of materials he uses at 
home to reload shotgun shells and may have removed some nails from 
his scrap metal pile they rooted around my nail caddy he said 
authorities have said the bombs mailed to alabama florida and 
georgia in december contained finishing nails eleventh us 
circuit court of appeals judge robert vance and savannah ga 
attorney robert robinson died in separate bombings 
locke said he had no knowledge of the bombs other than what he 
has seen in the media he added he did not believe oferrell who 
has been questioned extensively in the case could have been 
involved in the attacks 
like i told them the investigators i thought wayne was like 
a brother to the lord a christian locke said 
agents also questioned joe king and roy reeves last week at 
their enterprise shops but did not remove any items during those 
meetings 
meanwhile thursday fbi agents in enterprise continued their now 
familiar daily routine of scouring the area for an old typewriter 
they believe was used to write letters associated with the bombs 
the typewriter allegedly also was used by oferrell 
agents were seen thursday inspecting typewriters at a downtown 
pawn shop as well as at nearby fort rucker where a search has been 
conducted for the better part of this week 
oferrell who has not been charged has said he had nothing to 
do with the bombs he reiterated thursday that federal agents are 
barking up the wrong tree

gov george mickelson recognizing the 
historical hurt suffered by indians smoked a peace pipe with 
tribal leaders and proclaimed a year of reconciliation in 1990 a 
century after the wounded knee massacre 
the governor and representatives of eight sioux tribes drew 
deeply and passed the pipe thursday as they sat in a circle around 
a buffalo skull and other items in the center of the state capitol 
rotunda 
the members of the south dakota legislature and hundreds of 
other spectators applauded as mickelson and the tribal leaders 
completed the ceremony they then signed a proclamation designating 
1990 as a time for healing wounds that have festered between 
indians and nonindians for a century 
during the states centennial celebration last year indians 
refused to take part claiming they had nothing to celebrate they 
have been at odds with state government over issues such as hunting 
and fishing rights law enforcement on reservation highways and 
contracts for state services 
the governor decided it was time to bury the tomahawk 
mickelson said he gathered the state lawmakers and the indian 
leaders together to make this truly a year of reconciliation that 
marks a new beginning 
i believe it places a responsibility on all of us throughout 
this year to make a personal commitment the governor said 
indians are going through especially tough times in the state 
on south dakotas nine reservations unemployment approaches 80 
percent and alcoholism drugs and health care are severe problems 
four reservation counties rank among the nations very poorest 
in terms of per capita income 
tim giago publisher of the weekly lakota times had challenged 
mickelson to proclaim 1990 as a year to help ease racial discord 
between indian and white people in south dakota mickelson thanked 
the indian publisher for issuing the challenge 
in the proclamation mickelson said that as south dakota begins 
its second century of statehood people must also remember that the 
creation of the state was a sad time for indians 
in december 1890 a little more than a year after south dakota 
became a state sioux leader sitting bull was killed and nearly 300 
sioux men women and children were killed by us government troops 
in the wounded knee massacre 
strife between the cultures in south dakota has for 100 
years been of grave concern and continues to be of grave 
concern the governor said in the proclamation 
the 100th anniversary of the tragic events offers an opportunity 
for indians and nonindians to put aside their fears and mistrust 
build friendships cooperate learn about each others culture and 
develop a respect and understanding that will grow in the next 
century mickelson said 
more than 6 percent of the states population or about 45000 
people are indians according to the 1980 us census 
mickelson said he realizes state government and the tribal 
governments wont settle all their disputes in the next year but 
many of the problems might be resolved 
a council of indians and nonindians should put together a broad 
plan by march 1 for celebrating the year of reconciliation the 
governor said and each south dakotan should think about ways to 
bridge the cultural gap between indians and nonindians in the long 
run 
the proclamation was signed by the governor and representatives 
of the flandreausantee sioux oglala sioux rosebud sioux yankton 
sioux standing rock sioux cheyenne river the lower brule tribe 
and the sissetonwahpeton sioux tribe a crow creek sioux 
representative didnt show up for the ceremony but officials said 
a tribal representative may sign it later 
the ceremony opened when two sioux men sang the lakota flag 
song in a highpitched haunting wavering harmony and sioux 
military veterans carried in the us flag a sioux eagle staff 
adorned with feathers and other flags 
it ended with the sioux men singing the peace song

a jesse jackson supporter who runs a housing 
company suspended from government business wrote off a 30000 debt 
owed by jacksons 1988 presidential campaign according to a 
published report 
a bruce rozet a prominent democratic fundraiser and president 
of associated financial corp of california released the campaign 
from a debt it owed to a hotel that rozet partly owns according to 
former hotel workers quoted in todays editions of the washington 
post 
the hotel transaction was not reported to the federal election 
commission as either an outstanding debt or contribution as 
required under the election laws 
the department of housing and urban development said thursday 
that afc one of the nations largest subsidized housing landlords 
was suspended from future government work because of a fraud 
investigation 
hud in a letter to one of the companys affiliates said the 
government has information indicating irregularities of a serious 
nature and the company and its affiliates were being investigated 
afc leads more than 40 affiliated companies that control nearly 
50000 units of federally assisted housing rozet was a jackson 
delegate to the democratic national convention 
rozet in a statement and additional comments issued through a 
spokesman called huds action pure harassment for political 
reasons that ultimately would harm the lowincome families the 
agency is supposed to serve 
he denied any wrongdoing and accused hud of taking the action to 
avoid a hearing scheduled for next week on lesser sanctions against 
an afc affiliate 
the post cited former workers for the hollywood roosevelt hotel 
who said the debt was written off after the hotel was able to 
collect just 45000 of 75000 the jackson campaign owed the 
hotel the newspaper said two employees saw a company memorandum 
saying the unpaid balance was a gift from rozet 
jackson told the newspaper he was not aware rozet helped out 
with hotel expenses absolutely not jackson said first off 
we didnt need that kind favor and second it would have been 
illegal 
such a contribution would be illegal because it comes from a 
corporation individual contributions are limited by law to 1000 
per election per candidate 
on the suspension announced thursday hud general counsel 
francis keating said afc and its affiliates were being investigated 
by the departments inspector general law enforcement sources told 
the associated press that the us attorneys office in los angeles 
was also investigating the companies 
those sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said 
charles bazarian a man rozet used as a property scout who later 
was convicted of skimming money a from hudassisted project was 
cooperating with investigators 
but the sources declined to discuss the substance of the probe 
and the los angeles prosecutor handling it lee weidman declined 
comment 
rozet and afc have had a number of runins with hud in the past 
decade including several in the last year and rozet has said 
firstyear hud secretary jack kemp has allowed bureaucrats with old 
grudges against the company to dictate hud policy toward afc 
kemp visited one afc property shortly after taking office last 
year and termed conditions there scandalous kemps top deputy 
also has called rozet and his companies slumlords 
but community leaders in several areas with afc properties have 
defended the company and rozet often is called on by congress as 
an expert on housing policy one of rozets biggest defenders in 
congress is sen alan cranston dcalif for whom rozet has been a 
major fundraiser 
hud announced the suspension in a letter to an afc affiliate 
housing resources management inc which is controlled by rozet 
partner deane e ross 
also affected by the suspension are afc and more that 40 related 
development and investment companies involved in the purchase and 
management of governmentassisted housing and the syndication of 
tax credits developers of such projects receive from the government 
afc speaking on behalf of its affiliate denied housing 
resources management was involved in any improper activities even 
if those allegations were true afc said a suspension was 
unwarranted because the allegations involved about 35000

safety experted their efforts to convince 
drivers and passengers to buckle uged by a claim that rearseat lap 
belts can cause devastating injuries especially to children 
the institute for injury reduction on thursday launched a 
campaign to fit older cars wit shoulder straps contending lap 
belts used alo than 1000 serious injuries a year 
benjamin kelley the institutes president said many victims of 
serious lap belt injuries are children because they are more likely 
to sit in the rear seats of automobiles than adults 
the institute was founded two years ago by a group of lawyers 
who specialize in representing accident victims 
children strapped into the rear seats of cars often are killed 
or injured in slowspeed crashes by the sudden pressure of the belt 
on the stomach and spine he said 
but he said others in the car often emerge uninjured sometimes 
when they are wearing no belt at all 
but safety experts said many lives haved by seat belts an 
advance that could be reversed if people stop using them out of 
needless fear 
we dont want someone to think that its safer to sit in that 
back seat with no belt at all said jerry ralph curry 
administrator of the national highway traffic safety 
administration our concern is that by scaring the public 
parents will take a child out of the seat belt and that a child 
will t killedhe said 
in fort worth texas officials attending a meeting of the 
national highway transportation safety association were just as 
blunt 
the claims made at the washington press conference can causey 
needless deaths and serious injuries said beverlee anderson 
spokeswoman for the safety association meeting and director of the 
tennessee traffic safety coalition 
the association said the largeevidence shows more lives are 
saved by properlyap belts than by no restraining device at all 
we estimate that lap belts in passenger cars saved about lives 
and prevented over 1400 serious injuries in 1988 the statement 
said 
kelley did not advocate not using seat belts acknowledging they 
do save lives 
but he said that quickly fitting the nations automobiles with 
shoulder straps would help eliminate seat belt injuries he said 
such injuries can cause permanent paralysis through spinal damage 
or result in serious damage to abdominal muscles 
neither government nor the car industry are vigorously acting

kelley urged the government to urge auto manufacturers and 
dealers to make shoulderstrap retrofit kits quickly available to 
the public at affordable prices and to launch a publicity and 
advertising campaign to convince drivers to install them 
under a rule adopted last year by the traffic safety

the study published today in the journal of the american medical 
association linking olive oil consumption with lower blood 
cholesterol blood sugar and blood pressure is the latest volley in 
what often seems like a contradictory barrage of news about what 
constitutes healthful eating 
bonnie liebman director of nutrition for the washingtonbased 
consumer group center for science in the public interest advises 
patience 
scientists are used to having studies with opposite results 
and they know that over time the truth emerges ms liebman 
said consumers have only recently accepted science and health as 
news and they arent used to that 
with that in mind here is a list of some recent reports linking 
various foods to health problems or benefits 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
oat bran one could find oat bran everywhere even in beer 
after reports emerged indicating that eating it helped reduce 
bloodcholesterol levels and the risk of heart attack a recent 
study however said the apparent benefits of oat bran resulted 
from its replacement of fatty foods in peoples diets not from a 
special property of the grain itself and that other cereals work 
just as well to reduce arteryclogging excess cholesterol in the 
bloodstream 
rice bran although some earlier studies indicated that rice 
bran had cholesterollowering properties a researcher financed by 
the rice industry searching for such benefits has said he didnt 
find any and advised people trying to lower cholesterol levels to 
reduce fat intake get to a normal weight and exercise 
milk public concern about the safety of milk was sparked after 
two independent surveys found supplies in several areas 
contaminated with antibiotics and sulfa drugs used to treat sick 
cattle the government says it sees no public health threat but 
researchers are concerned about the continuing possibility of 
contamination from detectable and undetectable veterinary drugs 
coffee often subject to scrutiny coffee made news recently 
after a study revealed that older couples who drink coffee appear 
to be more sexually active than elderly noncoffee drinkers one 
researcher suggested that coffee stimulates the central nervous 
system and relaxes certain muscles but also said it was possible 
that coffee drinkers were more liberal in their sexual 
behavior some studies have linked coffee to heart disease high 
cholesterol levels and pancreatic cancer while others have found 
no such relationship 
fish oil a recent study found that large doses of fish oil can 
return mild high blood pressure to normal levels however the 
subjects had to take three tablespoons each day of liquid herring 
oil which caused belching and a lingering fishy aftertaste the 
amount of fish oil used equivalent to 50 fish oil gel capsules 
was much higher than that recommended by capsule manufacturers in 
fact when taken at the dose usually suggested the oil did not 
help 
despite their encouraging findings the researchers said people 
should not exchange blood pressure pills for fish oil until doctors 
know more they also advised people not to substitute cod liver 
oil which contains too much vitamin a and d and not enough omega3 
fatty acids oily ocean fish such as herring and mackerel are 
rich in omega3 fatty acids the particular variety of fish oil 
that appears to be good for the heart

medicare testing laboratories are billing the 
government program nearly twice what they charge physicians for the 
same services according to a report by the inspector general of 
the department of health and human services 
medicare could reduce significantly the more than 39 billion 
it pays annually for lab services if the program were to pay rates 
comparable to what physicians pay said the report by inspector 
general richard kusserow 
because medicare is such a large volume payer of tests we 
believe a strong case could be made for medicare paying less than 
physicians certainly the program should not be asked to pay 
more said the report released thursday 
the review of 4120 lab billings found medicare payment rates 
were overall about 90 percent higher than the amounts paid by 
physicians mostly because of the way medicare pays for packages of 
tests ordered as a group 
physicians are offered deep discounts for these groups of tests 
called profiles but medicare pays separately for each test 
according to its schedule of fees of 1525 profiles reviewed 
medicare paid 176 percent more than physicians for the same tests 
the report said 
nineteen of the 26 independent clinical laboratories surveyed 
had separate price lists for physicians and thirdparty payers 
including medicare of the seven labs studied in detail all billed 
medicare at least twice as much as physicians for the same tests 
and one charged medicare five times more 
labs most often said they charged medicare higher prices because 
they said it costs more to bill and get reimbursement from 
medicare the report said 
representatives at one lab complained that after they billed for 
about 500 medicare patients on a single computer tape they 
received 500 separate checks from medicare rather than one as its 
physician customers would have issued 
but the inspector general suggested some of the industrys 
complaints were unfounded pointing out that to simplify billing 
medicare eliminated coinsurance and deductibles for lab services 
in 1984 
medicare serves about 33 million elderly and disabled americans 
and accounts for an estimated 10 percent to 20 percent of all lab 
tests 
the program paid 39 billion for lab services in 1987 the 
latest year for which figures were available this was a 22 percent 
increase over 1986

a man with severe parkinsons disease showed 
marked improvement after receiving a transplant of brain tissue 
from an aborted fetus into his own brain european researchers 
report 
the transplanted fetal brain tissue apparently thrived and is 
producing dopamine a brain chemical that is essential for normal 
controlled muscle movements the researchers reported in a study 
published in science magazine today 
olle lindvall of the university hospital in lund sweden chief 
author of the report told the washington post that the study 
involving a single patient is very exciting and promising 
news but he cautioned that the study does not prove that we 
can get this effect in other patients or sustain it in this one 
parkinsons disease occurs when areas of the brain degenerate 
and stop producing dopamine a neurotransmitter essential for 
carrying signals from one part of the brain to another by 
transplanting fetal brain tissue into the affected area 
researchers hope to restore the production of dopamine 
clinical trials using transplanted fetal tissue have been 
conducted for the last two years and some improvement has been 
reported earlier in a few patients 
but lindvall said in science that the earlier cases did not 
determine if the transplanted tissue survived in the host brain or 
if dopamine production was restored some of the improvement he 
said could have been the result of the surgery itself 
the swedish study involved a 49yearold man described as 
severely affected with the muscular rigidity and tremors 
typical of parkinsons disease his right arm was most affected 
brain scans showed that the left side of his brain was deficient 
in dopamine production and that the right side of the brain was 
less affected 
the man who first developed the disease in 1977 was helped for 
a time by a drug called ldopa which is chemically changed into 
dopamine in the body but starting in 1984 the effect of the drug 
began to diminish a characteristic of that drug 
to perform the transplant doctors removed brain tissue from 
four fetuses within four hours of routine suction abortions the 
tissue was treated chemically and then injected by needle into 
three sites in the affected part of the brain of the parkinsonian 
patient 
from two to three months after surgery the patient exhibited 
a marked improvement of movement speed in the right arm and a 
similar change although of lesser magnitude in the left arm 
the science study reports 
the improvement the study said is consistent with the slow 
development of a growing graft 
the researchers said that the patient also now responds better 
and for a longer period of time to treatment by the drug ldopa 
a brain scan which can detect a chemical used as a tracer 
showed five months after surgery that there was a dramatic increase 
in the amount of dopamine present in the patients brain 
eight months after the transplant the patient continues to 
improve 
future assessment the study said will show whether these 
neurons the transplanted tissue can survive permanently or if 
they will be destroyed either by the underlying disease process or 
by immunological rejection 
eugene redmond jr a yale school of medicine professor of 
psychiatry said clinical improvement found in the study is very 
clear and well documented 
the therapy could become the best hope for many people he 
told the washington post although he cautioned that only a single 
patient was used and final conclusions cannot yet be drawn redmond 
and some colleagues expect to complete a study of fetal cell 
transplants in 20 patients within two years 
fetal tissue experimentation slowed in the united states last 
year after the bush administration banned the use of federal funds 
for research into transplantation of any fetal tissue into humans 
another researcher dr curt freed of the university of colorado 
medical center in denver said he got similar results with a 
52yearold man with parkinsons disease those results will be 
published in april 
ten researchers including four from england and one from 
switzerland coauthored the science study with lindvall science 
is the journal of the american association for the advancement of 
science

a woman convicted of murdering her infant 
baby the second daughter she had reported abducted by a masked 
gunman in three years was sentenced to life in prison despite her 
request for the death penalty 
jurors said thursday they spared paula marie sims her life 
because they did not believe she was soley responsible for the 
april 29 death of 6weekold heather lee and that she might 
implicate other people in the slaying 
jury foreman harold william ryan jr said jurors didnt believe 
her story that a masked gunman stole heather just three years 
after mrs sims firstborn daughter 13dayold loralei 
disappeared under nearly identical circumstances 
mrs sims was wellrehearsed ryan said but i guess we 
just didnt believe her 
mrs sims 30 was convicted tuesday of firstdegree murder 
obstruction of justice and concealing a homicide in heather lees 
death her sentence includes no chance of parole 
mrs sims told her attorney thursday she no longer cared to 
live and urged him to let the jury issue a death sentence 
she still maintains her innocence but says i dont have any 
reason to go on i dont have any reason to live defense 
attorney donald groshong told the courtroom before sentencing 
whether im innocent doesnt matter they can go ahead and 
execute me groshong quoted his client as saying 
but juror john joplin said the jury was not moved by groshongs 
plea for mercy and warnings to ignore the angry mob outside 
crying for blood 
instead it was the unanswered questions surrounding the two 
deaths that spared mrs sims joplin said 
she killed her children and she has to live with it the rest 
of her life joplin said by not sentencing her to death maybe 
shell help lead police to the others involved in the killings 
the sentencing did not end legal problems facing mrs sims and 
her husband 37yearold robert sims who may be charged in the 
april slaying said madison county states attorney william haine 
sims has not been charged in either infants death and he 
retains custody of the couples 2yearson randy 
charges of obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicide 
await mrs sims in loraleis death no murder charges have been 
filed in that case 
mrs sims of alton near st louis testified both her 
daughters were abducted by a masked gunman while her husband was at 
work 
mrs sims reported heather was abducted april 29 from the 
simses home in alton her body was found may 3 in a trash barrel 
across the mississippi river in nearby west alton mo an autopsy 
indicated she had been suffocated and her body subsequently frozen 
loralei was reported abducted june 17 1986 from the simses 
former home in brighton a few miles from alton a badly decomposed 
body identified as loralei was found a week later in a wooded 
ravine near the house

the armenian patriarch of jerusalem yeghishe 
derderian spiritual leader of thousands of armenians in israel 
the occupied lands and jordan has died of a heart attack he was 
80 
derderian died thursday in his home in the st james convent in 
jerusalems walled old city church secretary father george 
hintlian said derderian had been ill with the flu for two days he 
said 
bells of mourning pealed in the old citys armenian quarter to 
announce the death and dozens of congregation members rushed to 
the convent 
derderian was the spiritual leader of 8000 armenians in israel 
the israelioccupied west bank and jordan he was also one of 
three custodians of jerusalems holy places along with the greek 
orthodox and latin patriarchs 
derderian was born in the eastern turkish city of van and lost 
all his relatives at the hands of the turks in 1915 during what 
armenians view as a massacre 
armenians claim the turks killed 15 million ethnic armenians 
between 1915 and 1923 during the days of the ottoman empire 
turks counter that the number of dead is at most 600000 and 
that most died from disease and hunger during deportation from 
eastern turkey to syria and lebanon during world war 1 
 
during january celebrations of the armenian christmas derderian 
accused soviet authorities of not doing enough to stop the violence 
in azerbaijan where azerbaijani moslems were attacking christian

prosecutors are bringing charges against 
more and more pregnant women who take drugs but a lawyer for one 
woman accused of delivering cocaine through the womb says the war 
on drugs is going from hysteria to absurdity 
authorities in areas where expectant mothers have been arrested 
say theyre turning to criminal law as a last resort because 
nothing else worked in stopping the growing number of 
cocaineaddicted babies 
when you have seen these children shake it gets to you 
said lt stephan banakas narcotics chief for the pensacola police 
department if its through arrest or the threat of arrests 
whatever its taken to get people to take care of their children 
its working 
the controversy has emerged from the growing use of crack 
cocaine around the nation but mothers addicted to other drugs also 
have been charged in wyoming on thursday a judge dismissed a 
child abuse charge against a pregnant woman who drank excessively 
the judge said the prosecutor did not establish that the womans 
drinking habits injured her unborn baby 
more than 30 women have been arrested nationwide since the first 
mother was convicted of delivering cocaine to her newborn in 
central florida last august said alison marshall a washington 
dc lawyer 
some police and prosecutors said the arrests are a way of 
forcing mothers of cocaine babies to get drug treatment they 
contend that some pregnant addicts are going straight because they 
fear prosecution 
but crackdown critics they include the american public health 
association national womens health network and national 
organization for women say the arrests are doing more harm than 
good 
the threat of jail is scaring pregnant addicts away from 
prenatal care and hospitals increasing the risks to their babies 
said robyn blumner florida director of the american civil 
liberties union in miami 
some even say the arrests could encourage women to have 
abortions or result in trash can babies 
this is the war on drugs going from hysteria to illogical 
absurdity said attorney alan rapoport of the american civil 
liberties union he is representing kimberly hardy the first woman 
in michigan charged with delivering cocaine to her newborn through 
the umbilical cord 
a district court judge on thursday ordered ms hardy to stand 
trial after a pediatrician testified that the babys exposure to 
cocaine likely was responsible for his low birthweight inability 
to hold food down and gastrointestinal dysfunction 
two days after birth a drug test showed signs of cocaine in the 
babys urine 
critics also contend a nationwide shortage of treatment 
facilities for pregnant addicts means women who seek rehabilitation 
as a result of the crackdown wont get it 
in florida officials estimate more than 10000 babies are born 
to addicted women each year 
authorities in south carolina and the florida panhandle have 
been the most aggressive in bringing charges said marshall who 
represents the chicagobased national association for perinatal 
addiction research and education 
police in this panhandle city have arrested five mothers on 
charges of delivering cocaine to their newborn babies 
assistant state attorney jeff deen of sanford contends cocaine 
is delivered through the umbilical cord the violation occurs 
during the minute to 90 seconds the baby is outside the womb before 
the umbilical cord is cut 
deen said his intention is to use prosecution to force women 
into drug rehabilitation one pensacola woman received 18 months in 
prison after pleading no contest to cocaine delivery but that 
sentence was part of a plea bargain and runs concurrently with 
terms of equal length in two cases unrelated to drugs or children 
three other cases in pensacola are pending in the fifth case 
the woman was placed on 15 years probation 
at least nine alleged cocaine mothers have been arrested in 
greenville sc said solicitor joe watson who pioneered the 
prosecutions in that state one woman has entered a guilty plea and 
was placed on probation the other cases are pending 
the south carolina defendants are charged with child neglect by 
passing narcotics to their babies before birth 
pensacola has been able to help addicted motherstobe because 
it has the facilities to treat them said elizabeth myer client 
manager for the community drug and alcohol commission 
she estimated that before the arrests only about 40 percent of 
the pregnant cocaine addicts who came to her office asked for 
treatment now she said they all want treatment 
a lot of them will tell you i dont want to go to prison

the discovery of an aidslike virus in florida 
panthers has scientists worried about its impact on the endangered 
animals but they say there is no indication the disease is fatal 
to the beasts 
scientists have expressed surprise at finding the antibodies in 
panthers living in the wilds of south florida whose numbers are 
said to range from about 30 to 50 
its just another problem that we need to be aware of dr 
melody roelke state panther recovery project veterinarian said 
thursday 
these panthers are having to deal with so many facets that are 
potentially dangerous to them and yet somehow theyre 
surviving roelke said in a telephone interview from gainesville 
feline immunodeficiency virus was first detected in domesticated 
panthers two years ago a cornell university researcher testing 
panther blood samples last year detected fiv antibodies in six of 
20 tests 
technological advances in the identification of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome may partially explain an increase in positive 
test results a review of old blood samples using the new 
technology shows the virus was present in panthers long before it 
was discovered in humans in the early 1980s 
i believe from the research they have been able to go back to 
bank serum samples to 1960 ad they have found positive samples 
said roelke it may have been there a lot longer than that 
the time span the virus has been present gives researchers some 
relief that it does not spell doom for the panthers 
i dont think we need to look at this as another impending 
disaster if it was going to be that way it wouldve happened 
already said david maehr state wildlife biologist in charge of 
panther research in south florida 
but the positive tests adds a concern to the captive breeding 
program to be launched in march or april wild panthers will be 
sent to four florida zoos with the idea of boosting their 
population under controlled conditions 
roelke said it will be important to test the panthers and make 
sure none that test positive are placed in zoos with cat 
populations free of fiv

doctors need not be overly concerned about doing 
aidsvirus testing for fear that patients might commit suicide if 
they learn they are infected according to a study published today 
with proper counseling people who learn they are infected with 
the aids virus are no more likely to think about killing themselves 
than those who learn they are virusfree the study in the journal 
of the american medical association reported 
given the improved early treatments for hivrelated illnesses 
neither physicians nor patients should avoid seeking the test for 
fear they wont be able to deal with the results said dr samuel 
perry professor of clinical psychiatry at cornell university 
medical college in new york 
it is not an imminent death sentence as many people believe 
the study reported on 244 men and 57 women who completed written 
tests to gauge depression at intervals two weeks before and one 
week and two months after notification of results of their 
aidsvirus tests researchers said 
the reassuring part is that if people at risk for infection 
are given adequate pre and posttest counseling notifying them of 
infection doesnt increase their risk of suicidal ideas perry 
said in a telephone interview thursday at least not if they are 
asymptomatic and over a short time 
the less reassuring part is that people at risk seem to have a 
high rate of depressive illness independent of whether theyre 
infected with the virus he said 
previous studies have shown high rates of suicide among men who 
have developed the disease 
a study found the rate of suicide in 1985 among men ages 20 to 
59 who had aids not just the infection which may take years to 
cause symptoms but the actual disease was 36 times the rate of 
men without aids 
another study of 1986 california death certificates found the 
relative suicide rate of men ages 20 to 39 who had aids was 21 
times that of men without aids the researchers said 
in the new study among the 49 subjects who were found to be 
infected rates of thinking about suicide were 286 percent at 
entry and 271 percent and 163 percent at the followups the 
researchers reported 
among the 252 subjects informed they were virusfree suicidal 
ideas decreased from 306 percent at entry to 171 percent and 159 
percent at one week and two months after notification the study 
found

city hall is becoming as familiar a place for 
walter rhodes as the salvation army missions and churches he 
frequents by day and the shelters or bridges where he sleeps at 
night 
but rhodes isnt camping out on government steps or sifting 
through the trash outside the downtown building 
after seeing him regularly at city council meetings reno 
leaders decided in january to appoint rhodes to a city committee 
hoping he can help them resolve renos homeless problem 
i guess right now im going to be the token homeless person 
on the committee said rhodes 54 whos been homeless three 
times in his life but im glad theyre giving me the chance to 
be heard even if they dont listen i can say i tried 
the greenbelt preservation committee was proposed by the reno 
police department which showed council members photographs 
depicting filthy homeless camps along the nearby truckee river 
which officers want cleaned up 
rhodes initially saw the panel as another attempt to roust the 
homeless who number from 600 to 5000 in reno depending on whos 
counting and who qualifies some agencies count people temporarily 
living in the citys cheap motels as homeless others tally only 
those living on the streets 
as soon as i saw the police were proposing this committee then 
i knew it was just something they cooked up to get us off the river 
and out of sight rhodes says i hope im proved wrong 
rhodes who claims an iq of 167 is scheduled to be officially 
appointed at the feb 13 council meeting but already hes finding 
political life difficult 
as soon as it got around that i was going to be on the 
committee i got two death threats from two guys camped out by me 
on the river said rhodes 
rhodes moved from his living quarters under a busy bridge 
outside of reno to a room above the gospel mission with the help of 
a church friend who picked up the 30aweek tab for two weeks 
after the midjanuary death threats he escaped the darkness 
litter and human excrement polluting the riverbank 
this is where we live he said crouching near a makeshift 
campfire grill its cleaner than most but even the best camps 
are bad 
born in lisbon a small ohio town near youngstown rhodes said 
he graduated from high school attended one year of business school 
and took a correspondence course in religion 
he was placed in a mental hospital twice in the late 1950s and 
found himself homeless shortly after his release he later found 
work for a telephone directory sales company for nine years 
traveling through 37 states in the 1960s and early 1970s 
he became homeless again from 1975 until 1977 after a long spell 
of unemployment and returned to the streets again last september 
after he lost a telephone sales job unlike many of renos 
transients he said he doesnt drink alcohol or gamble 
its rhodes theory that about half of the homeless people in 
america dont want to get off the streets and a third of those who 
do want a home and job arent capable of succeeding 
the homeless problem will never go away because only about 
onethird of all the people on the street will ever get off he 
says i think its up to the churches to help them but when that 
doesnt happen its up to government 
renos city council has agreed to spend as much as 2 million to 
find a location for a new homeless center that would centralize 
many services now spread throughout the city plans are in the 
initial stages 
rhodes said the biggest mistake reno and other cities make is 
treating each street person the same instead of providing 
individualized help 
if someone wants to stay on the street all he needs is 
limited services like food clothing some shelter rhodes said 
but the rest they need help to find jobs 
its hard to get a job when youve been on the streets and 
smell like 16 miles of road added rhodes who wears a green 
corduroy coat he doesnt remove even indoors during the winter 
the worst thing to happen to homeless people is to be treated 
like we arent there or were less than human

a teacher who showed the film catch22 to 
collegebound juniors has been suspended along with a school 
librarian because the movie is rated r officials said 
la cueva high school teacher joyce briscoe didnt know about the 
movies rating when she showed it teachers union spokeswoman mary 
lombardo said thursday 
ms briscoe also had drawn the wrath of some parents in october 
for screening the last temptation of christ for students who 
had parental permission 
school board member leonard delayo jr said he was disgusted by 
the suspension and by two groups use of the last temptation 
issue in an effort to defeat a milllevy for schools in next 
tuesdays election 
i think the suspension was wrong and i think its wrong for 
one group to hold an entire school district hostage because of 
their beliefs delayo said 
ron frost spokesman for one of the organizations albuquerque 
american family coalition said the group had nothing to do with 
the suspensions but was pleased by the action he called for ms 
briscoe to be fired 
parents upset by the last temptation screening launched a 
campaign last month against the levy and any other proposed tax 
increases for schools 
last temptation is considered offensive by some religious 
groups the furor over the screening forced the albuquerque public 
schools to revise its movie policy 
new guidelines released last month require a school committee to 
review films rated pg13 or r before they are shown the principal 
would make a final decision 
ms lombardo said catch22 was not stored with other rrated 
films in the library school spokeswoman crystal mcclernon said 
librarian pauline jones has been suspended with pay for checking 
the movie out for ms briscoe 
superintendent jack bobroff said he decided to suspend the two 
with pay until the matter is investigated and resolved 
a rrated film at a movie theater requires children under age 17 
to be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian 
ms lombardo said the union plans to file a grievance for ms 
briscoe asking that she be immediately reinstated 
catch22 based on joseph hellers novel of the same name 
portrays life in a us bomber squadron during world war ii 
the 1970 film was directed by mike nichols and starred alan 
arkin jon voight orson welles richard benjamin art garfunkel

release he said speaking in afrikaans unfortunately a 
further short passage of time is unavoidable 
he did not elaborate 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater has said president bush 
will invite mandela to washington as soon as he is released 
south an antiapartheid newspaper in cape town reported 
mandela recently gave a letter to the government saying that 
conflict and violence in south africa would never be settled 
unless the government and the african national congress reached 
agreement 
the climate for negotiations would be created if apartheid 
legislation was scrapped the state of emergency lifted banned 
organizations unbanned political prisoners released exiles 
allowed to return and all executions and political trials halted 
south quoted mandela as saying 
the magazaine said mandela personally handed the document to 
justice minister kobie coetsee 
de klerk and mandela first met dec 13 since then both the 
government and the anc have given increasingly serious 
consideration to the possibility of negotiations 
de klerk who took office in august had eased restrictions on 
antigovernment protests and offered to negotiate a new 
constitution that would include a political role for blacks but he 
says he is not prepared to accept the ancs demand for a 
oneperson onevote system that would lead to black majority rule 
mandela 71 has spent more than 27 years in prison for his role 
in planning the start of the ancs guerrilla campaign his release 
is seen as necessary before black leaders will enter negotiations

the oil workers union reached a tentative 
agreement with amoco corp that is expected to pave the way for 
negotiations with the oil industry nationwide 
the offer was presented to union representatives thursday at 
various amoco refineries the oil chemical and atomic workers 
international union represents about 40000 workers including 
about 4500 employed by amoco 
strikes at individual oil companies had been a possibility since 
midnight wednesday with the expiration of some 300 contracts 
between oil companies and the union 
union leaders never planned a nationwide walkout but said they 
might strike individual companies 
amoco spokesman mike thompson confirmed from chicago that a 
tentative agreement for a new threeyear labor contract has been 
reached at at least two amoco refineries in casper wyoming and 
yorktown virginia 
union vice president robert wages said he expects the amoco 
offer providing a general wage increase of 236 per hour over 
three years to set a pattern for the current round of negotiations 
with the oil industry 
the contract calls for an immediate 80centperhour wage 
increase a 53 percent hike based on the refinery workers current 
average pay of 1518 per hour 
amoco agreed to increase its contribution to health care 
premiums by 55 per month for family coverage in the first year 
the company will add an additional 45 a month in the second year 
of the agreement and another 50 in the third year 
a 250000 death benefit for workers killed in workrelated 
accidents also was negotiated into the contract 
amoco agreed to provide up to 26 weeks at full pay for workers 
absent due to occupational illness or injury and an additional 26 
weeks at half pay 
but wages said in a news release that amoco failed to address 
environmental issues brought up by union representatives 
we are extremely disappointed at the industrys failure to 
address our proposal on environmental monitoring wages said 
it would have been in their own best interest to take that step 
it would have benefited them tremendously

the government says it will not charge two 
former ranking officials and three other mexicans who were indicted 
in los angeles this week in the tortureslaying of us drug agent 
enrique camarena salazar 
we are not going to file any complaints at this time a 
spokeswoman for the attorney generals office said in an interview 
thursday they were members of the past administration 
manuel ibarra herrera former chief of federal judicial police 
and miguel aldana ibarra who headed the mexican branch of the 
international policy agency interpol live in mexico city and 
served in the administration of former president miguel de la 
madrid who left office 13 months ago 
they were indicted wednesday by a federal grand jury in los 
angeles that is continuing a fiveyear investigation into the 
deaths of camarena a us drug enforcement administration agent 
and his mexican pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
camarena and zavala were killed after camarena led raids on 
marijuana plantations allegedly run by guadalajara drug kingpin 
rafael caro quintero 
camarenas body was found march 5 1985 on a ranch 65 miles 
southeast of guadalajara the dea pledged it will prosecute all 
connected to the case 
a mexican judge in december sentenced caro quintero to 40 years 
in prison for his role in the camarena slaying he is one of a 
dozen people convicted in the case in mexico 
a foreign ministry spokesman said authorities have no 
information about any us plans to request extradition of the five 
the los angeles indictment also named reputed drug lord miguel 
angel felix gallardo who has been in jail in mexico on narcotics 
charges since april the whereabouts of the two others humberto 
alvarez machain and antonio vasquez ochoa are unknown 
vasquez is charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering in 
the guadalajara slayings of us citizens john walker and alberto 
radelat in january 1985 
the indictment also named a honduran juan ramon matta 
ballesteros who was extradited from his homeland in 1988 and 
sentenced to a life term in prison by a los angeles federal judge 
after being convicted of masterminding a california drug ring 
linked to colombian traffickers 
neither aldana or ibarra could be reached at their mexico city 
telephone numbers on thursday 
but aldana 44 was quoted by the independent excelsior news 
service in mexico as saying he is considering a countersuit 
through foreign ministry channels 
aldana resigned from his interpol post on jan 2 1986 after 28 
years as a law enforcement officer he said he wanted to write 
books and do criminology research 
he resigned after the weekly newsmagazine proceso said a drug 
defendant had testified that a shipment of colombian cocaine seized 
at the mexico city airport was for aldana the defendant later 
recanted claiming his testimony was made under duress 
aldana alleged in recent interviews that camarena was corrupt 
he told excelsior his only involvement with the camarena murder 
were investigations ordered by the attorney generals office in 
1985 
the former interpol chief in mexico now is a top member of a 
lawyers associations in mexico city and runs a private consulting 
business 
ibarra 58 dropped out of public life in 1988 when he retired 
from the judicial police mexicos equivalent of the fbi 
newsweek said in a 1985 report that when ibarra led the force 
the dea gave him a tip that matta ballesteros was in a mexico city 
hotel but the magazine said that it took ibarras men 36 hours to 
reach the hotel and by the time they arrived matta ballesteros had 
fled 
the attorney generals office told excelsior that both aldana 
and ibarra have been called before federal magistrates since 
retiring but only to testify as investigators

syphilis has soared to its highest rate in 40 
years and young peoples education about sexually transmitted 
diseases is lacking federal health researchers say 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
just two of five major 1990 goals for the prevention of sexually 
transmitted diseases are on track 
the federal governments goals set in 1979 were aimed at 
reducing gonorrhea and syphilis while raising awareness among 
doctors and young people 
gonorrhea rates dropped as hoped during the 1980s the cdc said 
but syphilis is soaring and education efforts are falling behind 
theres good news and bad news said dr ward cates the 
cdcs director of sexually transmitted disease prevention weve 
made major inroads in controlling gonorrhea but weve seen much 
less success on syphilis and other sexually transmitted 
infections 
the major sexually transmitted diseases for the most part are 
preventable or curable cates said 
we have seen over the last half century that if adequate 
resources are targeted to each of these conditions it can lead to 
sustained efforts and controlling them he said 
the five goals for 1990 and the progress or lack of it 
reduce the syphilis rate to seven cases per 100000 americans 
per year and congenital syphilis syphilis at birth to 15 
cases per 100000 infants under 1 
status not likely syphilis in 1988 was at its highest rate in 
40 years 162 cases per 100000 with about 39000 cases reported 
congenital syphilis also has soared to a rate of 177 in 88 672 
cases 
reduce the gonorrhea rate to 280 per 100000 americans 
status likely the rate had fallen by 1988 to 303 down from 
more than 450 in 1975 
reduce the rate of pelvic inflammatory disease to 560 cases per 
100000 women 
status likely the rate dropped from nearly 900 in 81 to 610 
by 88 
ninetyfive percent of healthcare providers treating sexually 
transmitted diseases should be able to diagnose and appropriately 
treat all recognized forms of such ailments 
status not likely a 1985 survey found that nearly twothirds 
of physicians wouldnt implement traditional spouse notification in 
a typical gonorrhea case and 90 percent didnt assess their 
patients sexual practices 
give every junior and senior high school student accurate 
timely education about sexually transmitted diseases 
status not likely just three out of four teenagers surveyed 
in 88 reported education on the illnesses before age 18 
the atlantabased cdc said the war on sexually transmitted 
diseases was made more difficult in the 1980s by increases in 
ailments such as chancroid and herpes by the practice of trading 
sex for crack cocaine and by the advent of aids

a former marine and air force 
communications officer will face a substantially reduced sentence 
in exchange for pleading guilty to passing secret information to 
the soviet union 
frank nesbitt changed his verdict to guilty thursday five days 
before his trial on espionage charges was due to begin in federal 
court if convicted on the original charges he could have faced 
life imprisonment the plea bargain arrangement means he could get 
a maximum jail term of 10 years 
did you do it us district judge ts ellis asked nesbitt 
45 
yes sir nesbitt said calmly 
according to earlier testimony by the government nesbitt came 
to the fbi last october to tell them of an odyssey that led him 
through central and south america and on to the soviet union and 
back his attorney claimed nesbitt simply wanted some excitement 
in his life 
assistant us attorney mark hulkower said nesbitt passed 
information to the soviets later determined by the national 
security agency to be classified but the nature of the material 
was not disclosed publicly nesbitt was indicted in november on 
espionage charges 
nesbitt testified thursday he did not realize that the material 
was classified 
it was my true and honest effort not to do that he told the 
judge 
the judge set sentencing for march 16 the agreement does not 
entitle nesbitt to parole he also could be fined up to 250000 
fbi special agent lizzie cassell testified in october that nesbitt 
left his wife and two children in millington tenn last june 
leaving a note saying dont look for me im gone 
nesbitt said thursday he decided to go to the soviet union after 
contacting soviet officials while traveling in bolivia last year 
he said he was later kept in a safe house for a few days until he 
failed a lie detector test and the soviets then broke off the 
contacts 
he said he had agreed to cooperate with the soviets after they 
showed him a picture of his two children taken outside his 
tennessee home 
nesbitt said two soviet agents followed him when he returned to 
the united states and he went to the fbi ms cassell said that a 
few days after telling the fbi his story nesbitt was arrested at a 
virginia hotel when agents were forced to break the door down 
nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the air forces electronic 
security command in west germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the 
marine corps where he dealt with classified communication 
gathering he also worked in the los alamos national laboratories 
from 1983 to 1984 he had a top secret code word clearance in all 
his jobs 
his attorney david hopkins said nesbitt pleaded guilty because 
of a recognition of the strength of the governments case this 
is 10 years the other is life its enough to give anyone pause

a lot has happened out there in the last 23 years said 
vernell crittenden administrative assistant to the warden its 
not just one motorist coming down the road anymore 
youre going to have people rubbernecking when this happens 
there will be hundreds of people around the prison people driving 
by the media illegally parked cars 
considerations of a timechange developed after the oct 17 
earthquake when freeway gridlock and damage to the san 
franciscooakland bay bridge routed hundreds of thousands of 
motorists north to the richmondsan rafael bridge and right past 
san quentin 
prison spokesman cal white said that since no one at the prison 
has any experience with an execution a team is being trained 
the us supreme court on jan 16 rejected harris latest appeal 
superior court judge jesus rodriguez in san diego said thursday 
he had denied a defense request to postpone mondays scheduled 
issuance of a death warrant the execution could occur from 30 to 
60 days after the warrant is signed 
defense attorneys michael mccabe and charles sevilla contended 
in their motion that setting an execution date while harris final 
appeal is pending before the california supreme court would be a 
waste of judicial resources attorney time and public money 
the state supreme court has requested written arguments to be 
submitted by march 16 on 10 issues raised by the defense 
harris case procedurally is further along the legal appeals 
process than that of any of the 271 other inmates on san quentins 
death row

a judge dismissed a childabuse complaint 
brought against a pregnant woman because she drank alcohol saying 
the state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been 
injured 
the key as i see it is that the child already has to have 
suffered judge robert denhardt said 
diane pfannenstiel 29 was about four months pregnant when she 
was arrested jan 4 two months after another judge ordered her to 
remain alcoholfree 
a blood test revealed she had a blood alcohol level of 01 
percent the level at which a person is considered intoxicated 
under state law 
pfannenstiel quickly left the court after denhardts decision 
without commenting 
her lawyer mary elizabeth galvan said the judges decision 
thursday adhered to the letter of the law which states an injury 
must exist for abuse to occur 
if you want the child abuse statutes to cover fetuses then 
you go to the legislature and you ask them to enact that statute 
galvan said 
dr gary lang a pediatrician testified that studies have shown 
pregnant women who drink excessively are prone to give birth to 
children suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome which is exhibited 
by physical and mental developmental defects but lang could not 
say definitely that the defendants fetus had been injured by its 
mothers drinking 
he said it could take years to determine if the drinking had 
injured the fetus 
denhardt declined at the beginning of a preliminary hearing to 
dismiss the case he made his ruling after hearing testimony 
the defense never presented witnesses winning the dismissal 
after the state closed its case

prime minister toshiki kaifu today defended his 
conservative partys 34 years in power against attacks from four 
opposition leaders in japans first televised campaign debate since 
1960 
the governing liberal democrats face the first serious challenge 
in decades to their majority in the 512seat lower house elections 
are set for feb 18 
party leaders agreed to the debate after opposition parties and 
the news media criticized kaifu for dissolving the lower house of 
parliament on jan 24 in preparation for elections without giving a 
traditional preelection policy speech 
four versus one its not fair kaifu said drawing laughs 
after he tried to comment out of order during the threehour debate 
the debate dealt at length with the question of whether leftist 
opposition parties would preserve democratic liberties if they win 
a majority 
this election is a choice between liberalism and socialism 
and weve already seen on a global scale that liberalism has won 
said kaifu voicing the key campaign strategy of his party 
takako doi of the japan socialist party and japan communist 
party chairman tetsuzo fuwa sharply rebutted that theme 
ms doi accused kaifu of spreading ink like an escaping 
squid to obscure the real issues of the election under the 
current constitution liberty and democracy is already 
guaranteed she said 
sitting side by side kaifu 59 and ms doi 61 dominated the 
debate at the japan national press club 
it was the first televised confrontation between a liberal 
democratic prime minister and top leaders of the opposition since 
nov 12 1960 when liberal democratic prime minister hayato ikeda 
took on the leaders of the socialist and democratic socialist 
parties 
ms doi drew indignant looks from kaifu when she accused the 
liberal democrats of deceiving the public 
people feel they cant trust the government because of 
repeated incidents and the lies they have heard the socialist 
leader said alluding to a series of scandals and an unpopular 
sales tax enacted after the liberal democrats had promised to avoid 
such a levy 
its the way it was done thats the problem ms doi said 
we want to return the country to a true peoples government 
polls show the liberal democrats could lose their majority in 
the powerful lower house partly because of dislike of the 
3percent sales tax and partly due to the partys rocky record in 
the past year 
prime minister noboru takeshita resigned in april amid a 
stockprofiteering scandal his successor sousuke uno lasted only 
two months after allegations surfaced that he kept paid mistresses 
the liberal democrats lost their majority in the upper house of 
parliament in july 
after opening statements kaifu ms doi fuwa and the leaders 
of the centrist komeito clean government party and democratic 
socialist party responded to prearranged questions on foreign 
policy political reform the sales tax and other issues 
the highly formalized debate drew a lukewarm reaction from 
political analysts 
neither side was able to present a clear vision on how 
to handle pressure from foreign governments to open japanese 
markets said josen takahashi at mitsubishi research institute a 
private think tank

the judge in the trial of former exxon 
valdez captain joseph hazelwood rejected defense efforts to exclude 
as evidence the results of two sobriety tests 
thursday was the third day of jury selection in the trial of 
hazelwood skipper of the super tanker when it wrecked and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound in 
march 
jury selection was scheduled to continue today for the trial 
which could last six weeks 
anchorage superior court judge karl johnstone rejected a defense 
argument that bloodalcohol results should be banned as evidence 
because they were obtained more than four hours after the accident 
he also denied an effort to have the results blocked on grounds 
they were not presented to a grand jury as evidence of recklessness 
hazelwood faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and 
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil the maximum 
penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years three months 
in prison and 61000 in fines 
johnstone said he would study defense attorneys requests for 
information they say the coast guard is unwilling to turn over 
the defense requested blood and urine tests administered to 
hazelwood and members of the exxon valdez crew after the tanker 
struck a reef the attorneys said the state should be restricted in 
the information it can use against hazelwood if they do not have 
access to such material 
johnstone instructed attorneys for the coast guard and the state 
to compile a list of information that the coast guard provided to 
state prosecutors he intends to consider that list in weighing 
what the defense claims is material the coast guard denied it but 
gave the state 
federal attorney r michael underhill said the coast guard has 
been fair in its release of information but said the government is 
unwilling to concede its right of federal sovereignty and privilege 
in handling requests for material in the state court

pope john paul ii saw two starkly different sides of 
africa during his sixth trip to the continent from a thatched hut 
in guineabissau to a palace in chad 
although he delivered 35 speeches in five countries of the sahel 
region two offthecuff remarks summed up the popes look at 
todays africa 
even here freedom is compromised by poverty john paul 
lamented after stopping along a dirt road in cumura guineabissau 
and wandering unannounced into a tiny hut with no furniture water 
or electricity 
days later in chad the pope found himself in another world 
greeted by president hissene habre in his brand new palace 
complete with fountains 
good night mr president the pontiff said as he left 
you have a magnificent palace 
the average annual per capita income in chad is about 150 
the pope returned to rome thursday night after an eightday 
8600mile journey through cape verde guineabissau mali burkina 
faso and chad 
throughout the voyage john paul coupled his expressions of 
distress at the grinding poverty with warnings against materialism 
and unchecked wealth 
he avoided a potentially embarrassing situation by deciding for 
now at least not to travel to the ivory coast to consecrate a huge 
basilica in yamoussoukro that resembles st peters in rome 
some foreign prelates protested such a grandiose display in poor 
africa but president felix houphouetboigny says the church was 
built with his own funds 
the pope has been invited by the president and the local 
church hierarchy to consecrate the basilica and now its up to 
him whether to go on another trip vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro said many different elements have to be taken into 
account 
to offset any negative image the vatican hopes that a special 
institute for social development will be opened on the basilica 
grounds he said 
while the popes trip was intended to give hope to millions of 
impoverished africans his message was just as often directed to 
leaders in europe and north america dont forget africa and the 
third world 
the great changes under way in eastern europe should not 
divert attention from the south especially the african 
continent he said in a speech to diplomats in chad on thursday 
with the thaw in eastwest relations the polishborn pope is 
especially determined to draw the worlds attention to the 
persistent hardships in developing nations and the need for 
northsouth cooperation navarro said 
john paul pleaded for solidarity with africa during a ceremony 
in ougadougou burkina faso marking the 10th anniversary of his 
first appeal on behalf of the sahel 
god has allowed me to renew the appeal navarro quoted him 
as telling local bishops later if i hadnt done so i wouldnt 
be able to die in peace 
as the pope left africa planning was already under way for his 
seventh tour of the continent in september he is scheduled to 
travel to tanzania rwanda and burundi 
until then he offered the african faithful a simple prayer 
i ask god the pope said before departing chad to give 
all the people of africa the strength of hope

after 30 years of exile and 
mostly futile guerrilla warfare the african national congress will 
return to south africa for political battles in which it is the 
overwhelming favorite 
the anc which has exile headquarters in lusaka zambia was 
legalized today by president fw de klerk in a move that instantly 
changed the countrys political scene 
the most powerful black group opposing the whiteled government 
and its apartheid policies the anc has an estimated 15000 members 
in exile and millions of black supporters in south africa most 
observers believe it would win elections if the 28million black 
majority were allowed to vote virtually all leading antiapartheid 
groups in south africa support the anc 
its leadership is made up mostly of older welleducated men 
such as the imprisoned nelson mandela 71 and oliver tambo the 
ancs 71yearold president who is recovering in sweden from a 
stroke 
de klerk said today that mandela the countrys bestknown black 
leader will be freed shortly after more than 27 years in prison 
he is serving a life sentence for launching the ancs guerrilla 
campaign 
despite its aging leadership the ancs support is strongest 
among south africas black youths many of whom who received their 
political education in repeated street clashes with the security 
forces 
most of the ancs young backers are ardent supporters of the 
armed struggle until today the organization had said its 
guerrilla campaign remained an important part of struggle to obtain 
black political rights but de klerks announcements may prompt it 
to suspend violence 
the armed struggle has slackened considerably in the past two 
years and poses no serious threat to the south african government 
looking at our situation realistically we must admit that we 
do not have the capacity within our country to intensify the 
armed struggle in any meaningful way anc secretarygeneral 
alfred nzo said last month 
even prior to de klerks speech today at the opening of 
parliament the anc appeared to be thrown off balance by the 
presidents reforms its emphasis on the armed struggle and 
building support for sanctions against south africa were generating 
little enthusiasm now such policies are even less likely to win 
support 
the anc says it wants a oneperson onevote democracy in south 
africa a system de klerk opposes saying it will lead to black 
domination of the 5 million whites 
the anc also says it envisions a mixed economy in south africa 
though it has a strong ideological preference for socialism 
the anc founded in 1912 peacefully opposed the south african 
government until it was banned in 1960 a year later mandela 
launched its guerrilla campaign and most of the leadership was 
either arrested or went into exile 
seven senior leaders including 77yearold walter sisulu were 
released last october and have been campaigning openly on behalf of 
the anc 
they continue to support the ancs alliance with the south 
african communist party another banned group that de klerk 
legalized today the membership of the two organizations overlap 
and about half of the ancs top 35 leaders are believed to be 
members of the communist party 
de klerk also legalized the pan africanist congress a smaller 
black group that wages a sporadic guerrilla campaign the pan 
africanist congress split from the anc in 1959 over the question of 
white participation in the black political struggle 
the anc has some white members and believes in a multiracial 
quest for black political rights while the pan africanist congress 
believes blacks should be completely selfreliant

a labor leader says workers at assembly 
plants in this border city are unhappy with a new oneyear contract 
and wage agreement that ended a strike threat 
union and management officials at the mostly americanowned 
plants said thursday the new accord brought average wage and 
benefits to roughly 230 an hour a raise of about 15 percent 
union leaders demanding a 25 percent pay raise had threatened 
several times to strike after the contracts ran out at 53 of the 
citys approximately 80 maquiladora plants in which mostly 
foreignmade components are assembled for export to their country 
of origin 
a walkout could have idled as many as 60000 workers at the 
plants and in related industries in this town across the border 
from brownsville texas 
agapito gonzalez cavazos who has led the confederation of 
mexican workers in matamoros for the past 40 years said 
rankandfile were disappointed in the compromise which was 
reached in mexico city without his participation but he said the 
union would accept the accord 
there is a restlessness among the workers a malaise among the 
workers gonzalez said thursday after learning of the accord a 
worker who is not in agreement will become less productive 
fifteen percent to us means nothing because the cost of living 
in matamoros is high the most expensive place to live in mexico

conspiring to cover up the true destination of the c130e

attorney general dick thornburgh wants an 
independent counsel to determine if former housing secretary samuel 
r pierce jr and his aides broke the law by steering federal rent 
subsidies to politically connected developers 
thornburgh stressing that the special prosecutor law left him 
no other choice said an independent counsel is needed to determine 
if pierce and other former housing officials may have violated 
federal criminal law in the way they chose developers to 
participate in the moderate rehabilitation program between 1984 and 
1988 
the department of housing and urban development program provides 
rent subsidies and lucrative tax breaks to developers who perform a 
moderate amount of rehabilitation on lowincome housing units 
thornburghs formal application to a special court cited reports 
of a widespread perception among developers and local officials 
that funds were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to 
projects backed by prominent republicans acting as consultants or 
by former hud officials 
but the attorney general said he found no reasonable grounds 
to believe that further investigation is warranted of allegations 
that pierce lied during congressional testimony when questioned 
last may about political favoritism in the awarding of hud grants 
jack kemp who succeeded pierce at hud at the start of the bush 
administration promised to cooperate with the investigation 
this is a tragic situation for all involved kemp said in a 
statement however the department will provide whatever 
cooperation and assistance is required for full and fair 
disposition of this matter 
robert plotkin one of pierces lawyers said we continue to 
believe that mr pierce has not violated any federal laws and we 
are confident that at the conclusion of an independent counsel 
investigation that will be determined 
the attorney general an outspoken critic of the special 
prosecutor law made it plain that his decision to seek court 
appointment of an independent counsel was forced upon him by the 
statute 
thornburgh said the justice departments preliminary inquiry 
into the allegations which began dec 4 was hindered by the 
departments inability under the law to conduct grand jury 
proceedings or grant immunity to witnesses 
despite a review of voluminous information compiled by the 
hud inspector general and the house subcommittee and interviews 
with department officials a determination that no further 
investigation is warranted is virtually foreclosed thornburgh 
said 
any decision to drop the matter is made especially difficult 
by the breadth of the allegations and the fact that a number of 
figures central to the alleged conspiracy including secretary 
pierce and his former executive assistant deborah dean have 
declined to be interviewed thornburgh said 
thornburgh disclosed that pierce provided written answers to 
questions submitted to him by the justice departments public 
integrity section 
the special prosecutor law virtually assures that an independent 
counsel will be appointed by a special threejudge panel of the 
us circuit court of appeals the courts special division 
customarily acts within weeks of receiving requests by the attorney 
general 
the independent counsel law was triggered nov 2 when 19 
democrats on the house judiciary committee formally asked 
thornburgh to consider appointing an independent counsel to 
investigate allegations of political favoritism at hud uncovered in 
congressional hearings last year 
the attorney general said the questions asked by the lawmakers 
and pierces answers were too ambiguous to sustain any charge of 
perjury 
pierces statement to a house government operations subcommittee 
that he did not have a hands on involvement in running the 
moderate rehabilitation program is readily susceptible to 
countless interpretations thornburgh said 
thornburgh said there was also no basis to investigate the other 
allegation of perjury put forth by house democrats pierces 
statement that he did not give miss dean permission to say that i 
wanted certain programs is subject to several interpretations not 
unfavorable to the former secretary thornburgh said 
ms deans attorney joseph digenova declined to comment on the 
development 
she was one of three former aides to pierce who invoked the 
fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination and refused 
to testify before the house subcommittee hearings 
pierce after testifying last spring declined to answer further 
questions when called back last fall he too invoked the fifth 
amendment 
thornburghs decision was hailed by democrats who spearheaded 
the original request for a justice department review of the case 
rep tom lantos dcalif who chaired the subcommittee 
hearings said he welcomed the decision saying an independent 
counsel is in the best position to fully investigate and resolve 
questions of possible criminal wrongdoing

soviet military commanders and azerbaijani 
peoples front leaders met for their first direct peace talks 
bypassing local government and communist party officials peoples 
front leaders said today 
in riga latvia other representatives of the azerbaijani 
peoples front planned to start facetoface negotiations with 
leaders of the armenian peoples front with baltic officials 
serving as mediators 
in baku tofik gosymov one of 14 directors of the azerbaijani 
peoples front told reporters he had demanded the immediate 
withdrawal of the soldiers who entered baku on jan 20 after days 
of violent ethnic unrest in which scores of armenians were chased 
from their homes and beaten by azerbaijani mobs 
at least 214 died and more than 500 were injured in clashes 
between citizens and soviet soldiers according to the latest 
figures reported today 
the two neighboring southern republics have been engaged in a 
decadesold territorial dispute largely focusing on the armenian 
enclave of nagornokarabakh which is located inside azerbaijani 
territory armenians are mostly christian the azerbaijanis are 
predominantly shiite moslem 
the peace talks indicate the growing prominence of peoples 
fronts the unofficial grassroots organizations that have sprung 
up in the soviet union especially in republics seeking greater 
autonomy from moscow 
thursdays onehour talks at the azerbaijani interior ministry 
entirely bypassed the azerbaijan communist party and the caucasus 
republics government which has been sharply criticized for 
failing to control the violence the negotiations were organized by 
lev ponamarev of the russian peoples front 
there will be no further talks unless the kremlin agrees to 
withdraw its 17000 soldiers from baku gosymov said 
if the question of the removal of the soldiers is not solved 
we wont negotiate with them and we wont cooperate he said 
gosymov said lt gen vladimir s dubinyak the military 
commandant promised to transmit the demand to moscow 
the peoples front also demanded release of members arrested by 
the military and an explanation of what they said were military 
assaults on the peoples front headquarters 
dubinyak accompanied by his assistant for political affairs 
maj gen anatoly i kirilyuk and an official of the national 
interior ministry said those issues could only be decided in 
moscow gosymov reported 
he also said the military expressed interest in leaving baku for 
its own reasons gosymov said the peoples front needed at least a 
schedule for withdrawal of the soldiers to bring the situation in 
baku back to normal 
with such a schedule we can appeal to the people to go back 
to work and they will 100 percent he said 
soviet officials say more than 80 percent of bakus workforce is 
back on the job but the peoples front claims the figure is much 
lower 
the talks in riga were organized by the peoples fronts of the 
three baltic republics 
armenian and azerbaijani delegations appeared willing to try to 
iron out their problems at the negotiating table but baltic 
mediators cautioned that it could take two to three months to 
achieve concrete results 
we believe the exchange of views which will take place here 
will serve to create better understanding of the positions of both 
sides and to help normalize the situation and find a way to 
resolve our problems armenian delegate ashot manucharian told 
the associated press 
dainis ivans chairman of the latvian peoples front said the 
baltic peoples fronts want to share their strategies for achieving 
independence and democracy which have won greater freedom from 
moscow in a peaceful way while the caucasus has been engulfed in 
violence 
khikmet khazhidzade said he and his fellow azerbaijani 
negotiator sabit bagirov had found a meeting with the baltic 
leaders very constructive 
the armenians and the azerbaijanis agreed to discuss the 
presence of soviet troops the refugee problem and other 
humanitarian issues related to their conflict but khazhidzade 
stressed that final resolution of the dispute without a decision on 
the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh is impossible 
nagornokarabakh is not on the agenda but the baltic mediators 
say they expect the thorny territorial issue to come up early in 
the talks

president bush says he believes a democratic 
proposal to cut social security taxes is dead and he rules out any 
major tax revision despite charges that middleincome families pay 
a greater share than do their rich neighbors 
well in a world where you were starting over maybe we could 
design a better tax system but i dont want to open up the entire 
tax system at this point bush said thursday in an interview 
published in todays wall street journal 
sen daniel p moynihan had proposed rolling back social 
security taxes charging that the surplus in the social security 
trust fund was being used to mask the size of the federal budget 
deficit 
asked about the proposals chances bush said i hope its 
dead and i think it is after talking to the guys that are 
wrestling with the problem on the administrations behalf none of 
us has a feeling theres a great thrust behind it anymore 
bush said there is no need to take extraordinary measures to 
reduce the budget deficit because it isnt that long before the 
budget is in balance thanks to grammrudman reductions 
on other matters bush reiterated his support of soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev i do feel that after the summit at malta i 
had a better feel for him as an individual and what hes trying to 
do i think that he has done more in a short period of time for 
glasnost and reform than anybody in this room would have ever 
predicted 
still he said progress on arms control does not depend on 
gorbachevs continuing to hold power i dont think it depends on 
one man i think weve got a policy a program and i think thats 
established he said

irancontra middleman albert hakim placed on 
two years probation and fined 5000 says he is being threatened 
by intermediaries who never received payments in the uproar 
following public exposure of the secret arms sales to iran 
the iranianborn businessman said in court papers released 
thursday that he has been impoverished by the irancontra affair 
he had to defend himself in civil suits stemming from the scandal 
and hire criminal defense lawyers 
he pleaded guilty nov 21 to helping supplement former white 
house aide oliver norths income by allowing business partner 
richard secord to pay for a security system at norths home 
hakim told congress in 1987 that he promised to pay 
baksheesh to iranian intermediaries who helped open a new 
channel of communication in 1986 in the reagan administrations 
efforts to free hostages held in lebanon 
these intermediaries include individuals both inside and 
outside of iran a number of whom can only be described as 
dangerous hakims lawyers said in the court papers mr hakim 
has been threatened on a number of occasions if these 
obligations are not met officials who understood that money for 
the payments would come from theus proceeds of earlier arms sales 
to iran the iranians had been charged exorbitant prices in those 
sales 
he set up a 2 million reserve fund for the payments at the 
enterprise the maze of offshore companies hakim created to handle 
money in the irancontra affair 
the iran initiative was exposed before the payments could be 
made and hakim has been left holding the bag his lawyers said 
in the court filing the 2 million reserve was part of 78 
million frozen by the swiss at the request of the united states 
when the irancontra affair erupted interest on the money has 
raised the total to 9 million hakim has forsworn any claim to 
73 million of the money and he says he is unlikely to see any of 
the remainder 
it is to him personally that the iranian intermediaries even 
today are pressing mr hakim for payment hakims lawyers said 
hakim will be able to file a claim for the 17 million but two 
swissbased lawyers who work with him willard zucker and philippe 
neyroud also are claiming part of the money 
hakim says whatever he recovers wont be enough to satisfy 
enormous debts arising from the affair which he says he 
participated in only after he was assured every aspect had been 
authorized by thenpresident reagan 
north secord and former national security adviser john 
poindexter have been fortunate to belong to a community of 
military officers and others who have been able to offer them 
considerable assistance hakims lawyers said in court papers 
but hakim and his family have shouldered the burdens of this 
affair essentially alone

the communist party today appointed a new 
leader who has criticized hardliners and indicated he would speed 
the pace of democratic reforms sought by the nations emerging 
opposition movement 
alexander lilov taking power following a secret party session 
that ousted top old guard leaders has promised to overhaul his 
party before multiparty elections scheduled for may 
outgoing party boss petar mladenov will remain as state 
president bowing to demands for reform he had proposed that the 
head of the communist party and the head of state be separated 
the changes announced by the party were the latest since 
mladenov replaced todor zhivkov the hardline communist leader 
whose 35year rule ended on nov 10 and promised elections and 
other democratic reforms 
during the secret party session which ended early today the 
party also cut the size of its politburo and central committee 
those ousted included premier georgi atanassov a holdover from the 
zhivkov era 
the central committee was renamed as the partys supreme council 
atanassov and his 22member cabinet resigned thursday following 
sharp criticism during the emergency party congress for failing to 
solve mounting labor unrest in bulgaria the cabinet will serve 
until saturday when parliament will meet to accept the 
resignation the state news agency bta said 
the resignation was necessary to form a cabinet on a broad 
national basis bta said 
the communists have made a vague proposal for an interim 
government that would includ figures from the nations emerging 
prodemocracy opposition but the opposition has so far been 
reluctant to accept the offer until the communists say how much 
power opposition leaders will get 
compared with communists in neighboring countries who have 
ceded power to opposition groups after a wave of democratic reforms 
last year bulgarian communists have given up relatively little 
power and faced a relatively weak though growing opposition 
after his unanimous election by the supreme council lilov told 
the delegates that the party increasingly divided between 
hardliners and reformers will have to make changes before the 
election 
lilov the party ideologist through the 1970s who was shunted 
aside by zhivkov about six years ago directly criticized atanassov 
on wednesday and told the party congress that we are lagging 
behind 
if the programs are not competent and realistic we will 
lose he said 
the supreme council also elected mladenov lilov and two other 
top party figures andrei lukanov a possible candidate to be the 
new premier and defense minister dobri dzhurov to a presidium 
that will essentially replace the politburo under the new party 
structure there will likely be other members but the panel will 
be smaller than the former politburo 
the new 153member supreme council is less than half the size of 
the central committee it replaces 
the new council includes some communists who have called for 
radical internal changes including at least three members of the 
alternative socialist alliance a leader of that reform faction had 
said thursday it intended to split with the party and form its own 
socialist party 
not elected to the council were politburo member mincho yovchev 
prosecutor vassil mruchkov alternate politburo member pantelei 
pachov and six of the nine regional party secretaries 
the interior minister and one of his deputies were the only 
representatives of the security forces on the council and there 
were five members of the armed forces most members are 
technocrats managers and other economic leaders 
the delegates also created a 51member commission on party 
ethics and a 31member central finance commission 
zhivkov 78 has been arrested on charges of abuse of office and 
inciting ethnic hostility during his rule

the communist party has expelled former candidate 
politburo member yuri f solovyov for violating party ethics by 
purchasing a mercedesbenz for nonconvertible rubles tass and a 
party official said today 
the harsh action against a diehard communist comes just three 
days before a critical meeting of the communist party central 
committee where discussion of a new party platform is expected to 
bring a heated debate between progressives and hardlieners 
solovyov is still a member of the powerful central committee so 
his expulsion must be confirmed when it meets on monday and 
tuesday said vladimir kiryanov of the leningrad partys press 
office he confirmed that solovyov was accused of violating rules 
on car purchases 
if his ouster is upheld solovyov will lose his pension and 
numerous other privileges kiryanov said 
the expulsion was another humiliation for solovyov the former 
hardline leningrad party chief who was defeated during the spring 
in the vote for parliament despite having no opposition more than 
50 percent of the voters crossed his lone name off the ballot 
solovyov also was a candidate or nonvoting member of the 
partys ruling politburo in the kremlin until being demoted last 
summer he had been criticized for resisting the reforms of 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
the tass report implied that solovyov abused his position to 
obtain the vehicle but kiryanov refused to elaborate top 
communists have enjoyed special privileges like foreign cars and 
luxury food allotments for decades 
former soviet leader leonid brezhnev now blamed for economic 
stagnation and corruption during his tenure was known for his love 
of fancy western cars 
the tass article implied that others in the generally 
conservative leningrad party leadership might be threatened 
it said the local prosecutor had been asked to investigate 
whether other communist leaders bought their cars in violation of 
the law neither tass nor kiryanov explained the precise violation 
solovyov is one of many hardliners based in leningrad his 
replacement as leningrad party chief boris gidaspov is considered 
one of the leading hardliners in the soviet union 
solovyov was expelled at an emergency meeting of the leningrad 
party committee on thursday the day after the sensational 
leningrad tv program 600 seconds broadcast a report showing his 
name on an auto registration list journalist alexander nevzorov 
told viewers it had become easy to buy a mercedesbenz 280s 
automobile for 9780 rubles 
rubles are worthless on the international market so such a 
statement implies that the soviet government took rubles from the 
buyers and paid for the cars from its scarce store of foreign 
currency nevzorov noted in the broadcast that 9780 rubles is 
lower even than the state price for a sovietmade volga editor 
alexander borisoglebsky confirmed today 
shortages require normal wouldbe buyers to wait years or pay a 
vastly higher blackmarket price privileged people in the soviet 
union however can skip to the head of the line

today as warning pakistan that india is ready to fight if necessary 
over kashmir where two weeks of secessionist violence have left at 
least 73 people dead 
moslem militants today shot and killed a hindu businessman in 
indiancontrolled kashmir it was the first reported attack on a 
hindu civilian since islamic militants took to the streets in the 
northern area bordering pakistan 
in his remarks today singh said if pakistan wants a 
confrontation over kashmir the indian people and army are ready 
to give a befitting reply the united news of india news agency 
reported 
singhs statements made at a state government function in the 
eastern city of calcutta were the prime ministers first public 
remarks on possible hostilities between the countries 
india and pakistan have gone to war three times since they were 
partitioned in 1947 upon gaining independence from britain two 
wars have been over kashmir a region also claimed by 
moslemdominated pakistan 
india where hindus predominated accuses pakistan of arming the 
separatists pakistan denies the charge and accuses india of trying 
to suppress the independence movement 
police today set up road blocks at major intersections in the 
northern city of srinagar on the moslem sabbath fearing more of 
the separatist violence witnesses said 
police said militants and paramilitary federal troops exchanged 
gunfire but no one was injured 
a police official gov jagmohan said the hindu businessman 
satish tikku was shot in the head by two unidentified gunmen at 
his home in srinagar 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said tikku 
probably was killed because the militants suspected him of being a 
police informer not because he was a hindu 
but jagmohan ordered increased security in the predominantly 
hindu jammu region of jammukashmir state to prevent retaliatory 
attacks on moslems a government source said also speaking on 
condition of anonymity the rest of the state is mainly moslem 
an aroundtheclock curfew was lifted for only six hours today 
compared with 12 hours earlier in the week 
the daily curfew was imposed jan 20 when moslem militants took 
to streets and clashed with police the militants want to free this 
part of kashmir from indian rule and create an independent state or 
become part of moslemdominated pakistan

since then 
paramilitary troops and state policemen today partially blocked 
roads with steel drums and checked passing vehicles the witnesses 
said speaking on condition of anonymity each barrier was backed 
by sandbagged bunkers manned by 11 policemen they said 
mass prayers are held at mosques on the moslem sabbath and they 
have ignited protests in the past

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods rose 19 percent in december and closed out the year up 64 
percent the government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2442 
billion in the final month of 1989 after rising 24 percent in 
november 
the increase put orders for the year at 283 trillion after a 
97 percent increase in 1988 the largest since 1983 
durable goods were up 59 percent for the year following gains 
of 11 percent in 1988 and 76 percent in 1987 
for much of the year federal reserve interest rate policies 
held back orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to 
last more than three years because many of those goods are 
financed through loans 
but durable goods orders started to perk up late this fall and 
jumped 48 percent in november and 32 percent in december 
after the december report analysts said it appeared the 
manufacturing sector of the economy was stabilizing 
but the manufacturing sluggishness through much of 1989 was 
reflected in the reports figures for the entire year while 
durable goods orders were up 59 percent to 152 trillion they 
advanced at their slowest pace since a 04 percent gain in 1986 
in addition to new orders the commerce department said 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 05 percent in december to 
2318 billion while inventories dropped 04 percent to 3715 
billion 
if inventories increase without a corresonding gain in new 
orders it could signal produciton cutbacks in the future as 
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and back lots 
orders for durable goods rose 32 percent in december to 1344 
billion paced by transportation equipment which was up 112 
percent to 409 billion 
large increases in aircraft shipbuilding and tanks more than 
offset a decline in motor vehicles the department said without 
the transportation category orders would have edged up 02 percent 
electrical machinery orders increased 5 percent to 227 
billion offsetting a decline of 47 percent in nonelectical 
machinery to 216 billion 
primary metals orders were down 38 percent to 108 billion 
the oftenvolatile defense orders were off 116 percent to 996 
billion excluding defense orders would have been up 25 percent 
nondurable orders were up 03 percent to 1099 billion led by 
a large increase in petroleum products 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plants orders rose 18 percent in december to 
459 billion

punxsutawney phil americas premier 
groundhog emerged from his burrow today and indicated in 
unmistakable groundhogese that he had failed to spot his 
shadow a sure sign spring is just around the corner according to 
phils followers 
he stood proud tall and confident surveyed the throng of 
loyal followers peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his 
eyes groundward said county judge edwin snyder he is a member 
of the punxsutawney groundhog clubs exclusive inner circle which 
each year decides in advance whether phil will see his shadow 
snyder said phil turned to groundhog president jim means and 
signaled to him in unmistakable groundhogese there is no shadow 
today 
the squirming 10pound woodchuck was pulled from his manmade 
burrow atop gobblers knob at sunrise 727 am means held the 
groundhog up to his ear to hear the onceayear prediction then 
lifted him toward snyder 
the approximately 1500 people who had gathered under cloudy 
skies and in light rain cheered as phils forecast was announced 
ive always wanted to come to this event ever since i was a 
kid said peter teicher 49 of los angeles im really 
excited i couldnt sleep last night its a real thrill 
other prognasticating groundhogs around the country followed 
phils lead and also failed to see their shadows 
legend has it that if the famous groundhog sees his shadow when 
he emerges from his bungalow at sunrise on feb 2 there will be 
six more weeks of winter if he doesnt spring is supposedly just 
around the corner 
you know and i know that feb 2 is too darn early to expect 
spring to come said tim clark executive editor of the old 
farmers almanac 
but the twolegged variety of weather forecasters are still 
curious about what phil has to say on groundhog day 
i definitely do watch to see what he does i didnt say i 
believe it i say i watch it said albert peterlin a hydrologist 
for the national weather service in harrisburg 
this has a little bit of history and fact he said 
animals respond to temperature and environment as it occurs 
before today phil had predicted an early spring only nine times 
since 1887 when germanborn farmers initiated the yearly event in 
this small western pennsylvania town 
the farmers borrowed from the legend of candlemas a christian 
holiday celebrating the first time the infant jesus was taken to 
the temple an old scottish couplet claims if candlemas be fair 
therell be two winters in the year 
groundhogs part of the rodent family usually hibernate by 
december and stay underground until april or so but sometimes 
venture out early if the weather is mild 
phils never been wrong boasted means 66 
the 14 local businessmen who comprise the inner circle decide 
well in advance what phils forecast will be group members stages 
several rehearsals before groundhog day when they don top hats and 
tails for the event 
phils handler bud dunkel sported a fake fur hat resembling a 
groundhog 
every other day of the year phil lives at his heated 
airconditioned hutch at the local library with two other 
groundhogs philomena and barney 
as far as the old farmers almanac is concerned february at 
least around punxsutawney will be extremely cold and snowy 
followed by similar weather in early march 
the national weather service is calling for a warmer than usual 
february but a colder than usual march and april 
if i were to give you the scientific point of view i think it 
would be cold for the rest of this winter said meteorologist 
victor nouhan of course thats worth a grain of salt 
groundhog octorara orphie also saw no shadow in central 
pennsylvanias quarryville and neither did west virginias concord 
charlie as he was wandering around campus to see if any flowers 
are up said tom bone public information director for concord 
college in athens 
ditto for french creek freddie at the french creek wildlife 
preserve in upshur county in west virginia and general lee at the 
yellow river game ranch in lilburn ga 
the newest addition to the groundhog lineup little hog made 
his debut at the indianapolis zoo with fans joining in a rousing 
chorus of you are my sunshine on kazoos but there was no 
sunshine and no shadow there

olive oil a food already anointed with 
cholesterollowering charisma in a healthconscious age appears to 
also lower blood pressure and blood sugar say doctors who studied 
almost 5000 italians 
by contrast consumption of butter and other saturated fats was 
found to be associated with higher blood cholesterol blood 
pressure and blood sugar the doctors reported in todays journal 
of the american medical association 
the message is not new in a sense said the lead 
researcher dr marizio trevisan associate professor in medicine 
at the state university of new york at buffalo 
doctors have been telling people that a diet low in saturated 
fats will help lower the risk of developing heart disease he noted 
but olive oil a form of unsaturated fat with proven 
cholesterollowering ability may have an overall impact on 
coronary risk that is much stronger than we expected trevisan 
said in a telephone interview thursday 
i dont want to come out as a salesman for olive oil 
trevisan cautioned i think the results are exciting and 
interesting but a number of studies need to be done 
dr scott m grundy director of the center for human nutrition 
at the university of texas southwestern medical school in dallas 
agreed in calling for further research to confirm the findings 
im very loath to draw conclusions from epidemiology 
population studies especially when theres not a broad base of 
epidemiological data grundy said in a telephone interview 
grundy added the study provides a consistency with whats 
already known in terms of lipids fatty substances in the blood 
and thats reassuring it is of interest that other risk factors 
seem to be affected 
saturated fats derived largely from meat dairy products and 
coconut and palm oils are usually solid at room temperature 
polyunsaturated fats made from vegetable products usually are 
liquid at room temperature 
the polyunsaturates like the monounsaturates including olive 
oil are bloodcholesterol reducers and help protect the body 
against heart disease 
researchers analyzed data on 4903 healthy italian men and women 
ages 20 to 59 in a study exploring traits linked to 
atherosclerosis a thickening of the arteries due to a buildup of 
fatty deposits which causes more deaths in the united states than 
any other condition 
the study was conducted at nine medical centers throughout 
italy people were questioned about their eating habits and were 
tested for levels of blood cholesterol blood pressure and blood 
sugar 
levels of saturated fat consumption were found to differ up to 
40 percent with the lowest levels in the south where people eat a 
diet high in olive oil vegetables and starches traditional to the 
mediterranean 
in northern italy people consume more butter and other animal 
fats 
in both sexes higher consumption of butter and margarine was 
associated with significantly higher levels of blood sugar 
increased blood pressure and increased bloodcholesterol levels 
the study said though the link was statistically significant only 
in men 
whether elevated blood sugar levels play a role in heart disease 
is unclear and is under intensive study trevisan said 
diabetes in which the body fails to process blood sugar 
properly is known to be linked with heart disease but subjects in 
the italian study all had bloodsugar levels in the normal range 
rather than in the diabetic range 
italians who consumed more olive oil had significantly lower 
levels of systolic blood pressure pressure during the hearts 
contraction and of blood sugar and blood cholesterol researchers 
said 
the italian study found that diets high in other polyunsaturated 
oils corn oil soybean oil sunflower oil and mixed vegetable oil 
were linked significantly to lower cholesterol and bloodsugar 
levels in both sexes

following is the text of an african 
national congress statement reacting to measures announced by south 
africas president fw de klerk on friday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
today pretorias president fw de klerk made important 
announcements that go a long way toward creating a climate 
conducive to negotiations we welcome the lifting of the ban on the 
anc and other organizations we also welcome other positive 
measures announced by fw de klerk such as the suspension of the 
death sentence the release of some political prisoners the ending 
of media restrictions and the lifting of restrictions on 
exdetainees 
we are however greatly concerned that the pretoria regime has 
taken the decision that some political prisoners will not be 
released that the state of emergency is not lifted in its entirety 
and that the practice of detention without trial will continue 
these decisions subtract rather than add to the process of 
creating the proper political climate they must be reviewed and 
changed without delay 
we urge the pretoria regime to release nelson mandela without 
further delay questions concerning his personal security cannot be 
and are not the exclusive concern of the south african regime they 
must be decided together with his organization the anc 
the anc will take urgent measures to review the new situation 
that has emerged to determine the steps we have to take to move 
our country further forward toward finally ending the apartheid 
system this will include a process of consultation with the mass 
democratic movement of our country and all other antiapartheid 
forces 
the normalization of relations between south africa and the rest 
of the world must continue to depend on ending the apartheid 
system we therefore expect that no country committed to ending 
whiteminority domination in south africa will do anything to 
lessen the isolation of the apartheid regime 
the anc remains committed to doing everything in its power to 
end the apartheid system as quickly as possible and by all means 
possible including negotiations the review of the new situation 
will therefore include an assessment of the prospects of genuine 
negotiations to end the apartheid system 
this situation also calls for the greatest unity of all forces 
within our country that are committed to the perspective of a 
united democratic and nonracial south africa we therefore call 
on all our people to work for this unity with even greater vigor

a member of the governing conservative party said 
today that files have disappeared on a 1970s disinformation 
campaign to discredit the ira that critics say grew into a smear 
campaign against some british politicians 
on thursday prime minister margaret thatcher rejected calls for 
a full inquiry into the case she said there was no evidence that 
the security services operation was extended to undermine 
politicians 
lawmakers who claim they were targets of such an operation 
continued to press for a full investigation 
the time has come for a full open and honest uncovering of 
these things so that people in northern ireland can know that this 
has come to an end the dirty tricks that were carried on the 
rev ian paisley the provinces militant protestant leader told 
the house of commons thursday 
paisley allegedly was targeted because of fears that his 
political party might prop up a minority labor party government 
in an interview today with british broadcasting corp radio 
conservative lawmaker michael marshall said when documents i 
know have gone missing and there are other documents internally 
which seem to have gone missing one does begin to wonder whether 
there is a systematic problem here rather than a series of isolated 
incidents 
marshall said seven such files had disappeared but he gave no 
details 
mrs thatcher has for years denied allegations by former army 
press officer colin wallace of a dirty tricks campaign against the 
irish republican army and some politicians the mainly roman 
catholic ira opposes british rule in northern ireland and wants to 
unite it with the irish republic 
on wednesday mrs thatcher acknowledged in a letter to a 
lawmaker in her conservative party that her denials had been based 
on false information from civil servants 
she said however that none of the allegations involve 
activities since 1979 when she became prime minister 
her letter was released a day after the government confirmed the 
existence of a covert operation codenamed clockwork orange to 
feed lies to journalists reporting from northern ireland 
a clockwork orange is the title of a novel by anthony 
burgess published in 1962 about mind control in a totalitarian 
state 
mrs thatcher said she stood by her may 1987 statement that 
there was no evidence of misuse of information by any member of 
the security services and rejected a full investigation of the 
case 
in particular she said there was no evidence of any plot to 
destabilize harold wilsons 197476 labor party government 
such a plot was described in spycatcher the memoirs of 
peter wright a retired senior officer in the mi5 
counterintelligence agency 
wallace maintains he was dismissed in 1975 four years before 
mrs thatcher became prime minister for threatening to expose the 
campaign he says that in addition to his regular army duties he 
led a secret psychological warfare unit in northern ireland in the 
1970s 
wallace says clockwork orange began as an attempt to 
discredit the ira through false stories such as the claim the 
guerrillas had soviet rockets armed with unstable explosives 
he says it was later expanded to smear politicians such as 
wilson and edward heath who was conservative prime minister from 
1970 to 1974 
tony benn a former labor cabinet minister said another target 
was former labor prime minister james callaghan who was in power 
from 1976 to 1979 
journalist paul foot said in his book who framed colin 
wallace that wallace received detailed information on 
homosexuality bogus bank accounts corrupt earnings and communist 
sympathies 
foot said the campaign aimed at stopping labor from being 
elected in 1974 and also at deposing heath and former northern 
ireland minister william whitelaw from top positions in the 
conservative party

thousands of blacks sang danced 
and chanted today in impromptu street celebrations following 
president fw de klerks announcement of sweeping changes 
including legalization of the african national congress 
we had expected that mr de klerk might deliver something but 
what he said has certianly taken my breath away said anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu who could not stop laughing and smiling 
throughout a news conference at st georges cathedral 
we are probably seeing history in the making in south africa 
a predominately black crowd of 5000 broke into cheers and 
whistles in the parade ground outside cape town city hall when 
antiapartheid activist popo molefe gave them the news over a 
bullhorn from the back of an open truck 
the crowd marched peacefully through the streets in and out of 
the nearby train station announcing over a bullhorn to startled 
train passengers this is an anc station 
scores of white policemen and white shopkeepers watched silently 
from the sidewalks some shaking their heads but police riot 
squads kept out of view on side streets 
in johannesburg whites came out of their shops to take pictures 
with instamatic cameras and many smiled as hundreds of blacks 
danced and marched through downtown waving banners and newspaper 
vendors placards which declared anc unbanned 
at the offices of the antiapartheid congress of south african 
trade unions a huge black greenandgold anc banner was hung from 
the windows 
drivers stopped their cars in the street honking their horns 
and punching their fists into their air as black workers stuck 
their heads out office windows whistling and shouting 
police halted the march with a line of yellow patrol vehicles 
chased some as they tried to march back to the union headquarters 
and sprayed tear gas on demonstrators singing on the sidewalk after 
they were ordered to disperse no injuries or arrests were reported 
in durban the sound of cheers intensified as a group of black 
railway union members broke out of their strike settlement meeting 
to dance and march through the city center 
leaders of antiapartheid groups gathered around radios and 
televisions listening intently to the speech when de klerk 
announced that restrictions had been lifted on 374 activists many 
of those who were under the orders broke into smiles 
blacks in the townships were out in the dirt streets between 
their shanty homes chatting laughing and listening to the radio 
in cape town blacks and whites stood in groups with one person 
reading aloud the stories under the headline of the afternoon 
newspaper which said anc legalized 
the staying power for me would be the ability of mr de klerk 
to move very quickly now to do those things and to make them 
concrete said the rev allan boesak a leading activist and 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches i have a 
lot more faith in his ability now than i did a week ago 
at the downtown rally molefe said we would be unreasonable 
if we failed to acknowledge that of all the presidents of all the 
leaders of the nationalist government that in fact de klerk has 
taken the most bold step and has emerged as the most courageous 
however molefe noted the changes still had limitations 
he said that if anc president oliver tambo recovering from a 
stroke in sweden were to return to south africa from his 30year 
exile tomorrow he could still be arrested under the existing 
internal security act or the remaining emergency regulations 
winnie mandela wife of imprisoned anc leader nelson mandela was 
disappointed her husband was not released immediately from prison 
we want to warn mr de klerk we are not going to accept a bone 
without any meat the unbanning of the anc the south african 
communist party and the panafricanist congress in the prevailing 
south african climate is simply a recipe for further problems

authorities exploded what appeared to be 
a mail bomb sent to the naacp branch in washington county last 
month before discovering it was a fake authorities said today 
an office worker collecting the groups mail from a post office 
box in this western pennsylvania town decided not to open a 
suspiciouslooking package after it arrived jan 19 said louis 
waller a former naacp branch president 
postal officials xrayed the box which contained wires and two 
batteries but couldnt determine if it was a bomb until after it 
was exploded by pittsburgh police said dick balya a postal 
inspector in pittsburgh 25 miles northeast of washington 
we think it might have been sent locally by some less than 
rocket scientist type people said balya 
the package contained an unsigned letter with racist remarks 
aimed at both the national association for the advancement of 
colored people and jews waller said 
someone went to a lot of trouble to make us think it was a 
real bomb waller said 
the national naacp sent warning to its 1800 branches last 
august after a teargas bomb was mailed to its atlanta southeastern 
regional office and again when its jacksonville fla branch 
received a mail bomb on dec 19 
about the same time as the december bomb was received a federal 
appeals judge in alabama and a civil rights attorney in savannah 
ga were killed when they opened mail bombs the bomb sent to 
jacksonville and another sent to a federal courthouse in atlanta 
were defused authorities believe the incidents were racially 
motivated 
washington county last year was the site of racial tensions when 
former pittsburgh steelers football player mel blount announced 
plans to build a home for trouble boys near taylorstown 
members of the ku klux klan distributed fliers protesting the 
home in may but buffalo township officials eventually granted 
blount a zoning change necessary to begin construction 
balya said investigators have found no evidence the package was 
sent by the klan even though the package was not a bomb the 
sender could be charged under federal postal regulations dealing 
with mailing dangerous items he said

president bush announced today he will 
review us sanctions against south africa with congressional 
leaders calling pretorias decision to free imprisoned black 
leader nelson mandela quite positive 
i think when people move in the right direction it is 
certainly time to review all policy bush said speaking with 
reporters aboard air force one before his arrival in raleigh nc 
for an appearance at north carolina state university 
however bush indicated any easing of sanctions would depend on 
south african president fw de klerk making good on his promise to 
free mandela we want to see the policy initiatives go forward 
the release of mandela he said 
bush previously had indicated he would invite mandela to the 
united states once he is freed and would also invite de klerk 
de klerk announced earlier today that mandela will be freed but 
not immediately 
de klerk also legalized mandelas outlawed african national 
congress after 30 years of guerrilla war against white rule he 
said he would lift bans on more than 30 other opposition groups 
free all prisoners jailed for belonging to these groups declare a 
moratorium on executions and scrap most of the restrictions 
imposed during more than three years of a state of emergency 
bush called de klerks announcement very interesting and i 
would say quite positive 
i view it positively and most people around the world will 
he added 
referring to de klerk the president said he recognizes the 
status quo is not acceptable to him or the people of south africa 
and to a lot of people in the world who want to see a more just 
society 
asked if the announcement could lead to an easing of us 
sanctions imposed in 1986 bush said i want to talk to the 
congressional leaders about that 
however he indicated there was bound to be a lot of debate 
and discussion inside the administration about what the next move 
by the united states ought to be 
he said im one who has not proposed additional sanctions 
i dont want any additional sanctions but i do want a review 
the sanctions include a ban on importing south african steel 
textiles uranium coal and agricultural produce they also bar new 
us investment in south africa forbid new bank loans and end us 
landing rights for south african airways 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater welcomed de 
klerks action as positive steps and said we remain hopeful 
the release will occur as soon as possible 
rep william gray dpa the house majority whip and author of 
legislation imposing the sanctions said bush should hold off 
bringing de klerk to the white house 
sen paul simon dill chairman of a senate subcommittee on 
africa also suggested that inviting de klerk to the united states 
would be premature 
i urge caution before that step is taken simon said 
state visits involving south africa have been ruled out by past 
administrations as long as we continue to have fundamental 
differences with the south african government 
the bush administration raised the possibility of inviting de 
klerk to the united states last year but never followed through 
after dozens of lawmakers objected to the visit 
on thursday fitzwater said bush would invite mandela and de 
klerk for separate visits if mandela is released 
bushs purpose would be to determine how the us can best 
help south africa move forward toward a nonracial government and 
society fitzwater said 
releasing mandela would be a significant step gray said 
adding i applaud the president for wanting to meet with 
mandela but before bush sees de klerk the american president 
should hold talks with a crosssection of black south africans to 
garner their views gray said 
gray also said south africa would have to free all political 
prisoners not just mandela lift the ban on political groups 
opposed to apartheid and end all residential restrictions before 
congress would consider loosening economic sanctions

four top officials in the government 
of nicolae ceausescu were convicted today of supporting his orders 
to shoot scores of demonstrators and were sentenced to life in 
prison by a military tribunal 
the four men were convicted of being accomplices to a genocide 
during the december revolution that toppled the communist dictator 
after 24 years radio bucharest reported 
western diplomats have said as many as 10000 people died in the 
fighting between ceausescus securitate forces and citizens who 
joined with the army 
the tribunal the first to try leading figures in the ceausescu 
government rejected a prosecution demand that the four be 
convicted of the more serious crime of coauthorship to 
genocide 
the fivejudge panel ordered the seizure of all property 
belonging to the four men including gold jewels and large sums 
of money and stripped them of their civil rights 
the four who had already pleaded guilty to the charge of 
complicity to genocide stood solemnly as the tribunal 
president col andrei nitoiu announced the majority verdict after 
two hours of deliberation 
three of the four defendants emil bobu 62 former secretary 
of the communist party central committee and the thirdranking 
member of the ceausescu leadership former state council vice 
president manea manescu 74 and former politburo member ion dinca 
62 stared at the judges showing no emotion as the verdict was 
read former interior minister tudor postelnicu 59 bowed his 
head as he had through much of the fiveday trial 
bobu postelnicu and manescu said they would appeal but dinca 
told the judge he would not 
manescu while saying he was guilty had asked for a lesser 
sentence than the others contending he had no part in the 
repression of the demonstrators 
the four politburo members admitted they backed ceausescus 
orders to shoot the demonstrators and did nothing to end his 
dictatorship but they all denied they gave direct orders to put 
down the protests 
the military prosecutor col aurel cosma urged the judges to 
imprison all four for life on behalf of the thousands of victims 
of orphans children men women and brave military men who were 
killed in the revolution 
ceausescu and his wife elena fled bucharest by helicopter on 
dec 22 as demonstrators neared the communist party central 
committee headquarters they were arrested convicted of genocide 
and ruining the nations economy in a secret summary trial and 
executed on dec 25 
the ceausescus were accused during their trial of killing 60000 
romanians during their 24 years in power 
the national salvation front which took power during the 
revolution later abolished the death penalty make life in prison 
the maximum penalty 
the convictions of the four former officials came after a tense 
standoff between the national salvation front and a growing 
opposition movement 
the front made up of former communist officials intellectuals 
and reformers came under fire after announcing that it would field 
candidates in the may 20 elections critics said candidates fielded 
by theprovisional governmentwould have an unfair advantage 
the opposition argued that the unelected national salvation 
front couldnt be a referee and player in romanias first free 
election since world war ii 
the crisis was defused for the time being on thursday when the 
front formed a new governing coalition that includes opposition 
members

african national congress leaders today 
cautiously welcomed the south african governments decision to 
legalize their guerrilla group but said the measures do not go far 
enough to end apartheid 
the anc said in a statement that south africas whiteled 
government should remain isolated in the world community until it 
agrees to take further steps they said sanctions against south 
africa should be maintained and strengthened 
victory is in sight said veteran anc leader walter sisulu 
who described as progressive the steps announced by president 
fw de klerk at the opening of south africas parliament in cape 
town 
de klerk said he was legalizing anc lifting bans or 
restrictions on more than 60 other organizations and freeing most 
people who had been jailed for joining them when they were banned 
he told parliament he was relaxing state of emergency 
restrictions and would soon free jailed anc leader nelson mandela 
de klerk did not say when mandela would be freed saying more time 
was needed to settle issues related to his safety 
the anc statement said south africas main black nationalist 
movement was greatly concerned that some political prisoners 
will not be released that the state of emergency will not be 
wholly removed and that detentions without trial may continue 
the anc said mandela should be freed without further delay 
and that the anc would share with the south african government 
responsibility for his safety after his release mandela 71 was 
jailed 27 years ago for plotting against whiteminority rule 
sisulu and other veteran anc leaders were in sweden on their 
first visit outside africa since being released from prison in 
october where they had served 25 years of a life sentence 
sisulu asked whether negotiations with the government could 
start now replied no this is merely a preliminary 
he has done a great deal sisulu said of de klerk asked 
whether de klerk had gone far enough however sisulu said no 
not yet this is only the beginning we want the end of 
apartheid in south africa 
before negotiations can start sisulu said the government will 
have to remove soldiers and police from black townships and clarify 
its attitude toward political exiles including anc president 
oliver tambo recovering in a stockholm clinic from a stroke 
sisulu said it was unclear whether tambo could safely return from 
exile 
sisulu said he was not confident that the south african 
government was committed to ending apartheid 
i dont know yet he said they have made a progressive 
beginning and on the basis of that i hope they will go further 
in harare zimbabwe anc spokesman pallo jordan said the 
government still has laws it canuse to move against opposition 
groups repressive measures can still be deployed against us 
because the capacity is there in term of statutes jordan said

president janez drnovsek today said 
he brought new ideas to the troubled province of kosovo in a 
personal effort to halt mounting ethnic unrest that has already 
claimed at least 21 lives 
no new demonstrations by ethnic albanians were reported today 
after 10 days of unrest but a virtual general strike appeared to 
be in force in the southern province yugoslavias poorest region 
production has almost completely stopped the state tanjug 
news agency said adding that even those who showed up at their 
jobs were refusing to work 
at least 30000 people throughout kosovo have been on strike 
since the unrest started on jan 24 at pristina university 
official statistics show 
the deaths resulted from clashes between the provinces majority 
ethnic albanians and police on thursday trainloads of minority 
serbs fled the province and tanks sent from neighboring serbia 
patrolled pristina 
i have come with some new ideas for solving the kosovo 
problem drnovsek told journalists after arriving in the kosovo 
capital but he declined to elaborate saying he would first 
discuss them with provincial authorities 
in the yugoslav capital belgrade premier ante markovic and six 
other cabinet members including the defense and interior 
ministers formed a special unit to monitor and control the 
situation in kosovo tanjug reported today 
ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent of kosovos 19 million 
people have been demanding greater autonomy for their province 
since the enactment a year ago of constitutional amendments that 
gave serbia yugoslavias largest state more control over the 
province 
three people including a young girl lost their lives in 
protests thursday pristina radio said that brought the death toll 
in the recent unrest to 21 by official count 
serbian authorities maintain the changes were necessary to 
protect the serbian minority against alleged harassment by the 
ethnic albanians 
yugoslavias liberal northern regions of slovenia and croatia 
have backed ethnic albanian calls for greater selfgovernment to 
the province 
about 10000 serbs rallied in a downtown pristina sports center 
today demanding the federal government ensure order in the region 
or they would arm themselves to do so 
ethnic albanian nationalists have clearly demonstrated they 
intend to secede from yugoslavia in order to join albania deputy 
defense minister adm stane brovet told parliament in belgrade 
today tanjug reported their intentions must be thwarted by all 
means including force 
but the slovenian newspaper delo today said there was no civil 
war in kosovo only powerless demonstrators whose every act 
is immediately misinterpreted in the provinces politicized 
atmosphere

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposal for a 35nation summit meeting now has the qualified 
approval of the bush administration provided a treaty is 
completed to reduce troops and tanks in europe 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the senate foreign 
relations committee on thursday the summit could be the forum for 
signing the treaty and also provide a framework to deal with the 
question of german reunification 
but he said the soviets first must agree to the principle that 
free elections are a human right 
gorbachev proposed the summit be held this year and the 12 
members of the european community have endorsed the idea of a 
farranging meeting baker said we would be willing to attend 
such a summit to sign the treaty provided us conditions are met 
it is not clear however if the treaty can be concluded this 
year taking bakers qualifications into account the summit 
meeting presumably could be held next year as well with us 
approval 
a treaty to reduce nato and warsaw pact troops and nonnuclear 
weapons in europe is nearing completion in vienna however baker 
said there is disagreement on how to deal with combat aircraft and 
helicopters 
the soviets insist that some of the planes the west wants to 
restrict are defensive in mission and should be excluded from 
limits 
president bushs proposal on wednesday night for deeper cuts 
also could complicate completion of the pact 
the 35nation conference would bring together the united states 
canada the soviet union the vatican and all the countries of 
europe except albania the same 35 signed the helsinki agreement of 
1975 that promoted human rights and in effect recognized the 
postworld war ii borders of europe 
sen joseph d biden jr ddel had urged the bush 
administration to accept gorbachevs proposal 
if we dont provide a framework that accommodates east and 
west german concerns to resolve the unification issue events could 
seize the day biden said 
the senator earlier had urged the bush administration to accept 
gorbachevs offer and to use the 35nation conference to discuss 
further cuts in troops and weapons the german question and a 
timetable for the removal of all foreign forces from europe 
baker will hold talks next thursday and friday in moscow with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and possibly 
gorbachev his endorsement of the summit proposal although 
qualified represented another attempt by the bush administration 
to back the soviet leader 
also us officials are trying to develop a strategy for 
dealing with the german issue 
on tuesday gorbachev appeared to soften the soviets 
longstanding opposition to reunification it is essential to act 
responsibly and not seek the solution to this important issue on 
the streets the soviet leader said during a visit to moscow by 
hans modrow the east german premier 
baker said the prospect of a 35nation summit could serve as a 
carrot to encourage completion by nato and the warsaw pact of a 
treaty this year to reduce troops and weapons in europe 
the treaty would set a ceiling of 275000 for us and soviet 
soldiers on foreign soil president bush on wednesday night 
proposed reducing the level to 225000 and setting a subceiling of 
195000 for central europe which includes east and west germany 
it was not clear if the deeper cuts would be part of the treaty 
now being negotiated in vienna or become the basis of a second 
treaty 
baker stressed the us priority is to complete a treaty by the 
time bush and gorbachev hold a summit meeting in washington in the 
second half of june 
referring to the treaty which is known as cfe for conventional 
forces in europe baker told biden we would be willing to attend 
such a summit provided we can get a cfe agreement completed and 
signed at such an event 
also baker said a scheduled review in 1992 of compliance with 
the helsinki agreement should be held as well

renegade gen michel aouns troops 
attacked a rival christian militias command post today in the 
heaviest fighting in a 4dayold confrontation that has reportedly 
killed at least 100 people 
president elias hrawi urged france and other countries to demand 
that aoun halt the fighting lebanons maronite catholic prelate 
called on both sides to end this mass suicide 
police said at least 450 people have been wounded during the 
conflict and two people were killed and 23 wounded from stray 
mortar shells and gunfire that hit moslem west beirut which has 
not been involved in the christian fighting 
police said they could not say how many people had been killed 
today because of the intensity of the clashes in east beiruts 
ashrafiyeh and karantina districts 
they said the tankled forces of aoun moving behind a howitzer 
barrage of 20 shells a minute were trying to penetrate defenses of 
samir geageas lebanese forces the main christian militia 
the lebanese forces said in a communique its forces were 
shaking off one tank assault after another 
in another communique the lebanese forces said commanders of 
aouns air base at adma north of beirut were negotiating 
surrender terms with our forces adma the communique said has 
been surrounded by geageas militiamen since thursday 
a police spokesman said geageas fighters were locked in 
closerange clashes with aouns troops on the southern edge of 
ashrafiyeh that also commands a street leading to beiruts northern 
entrance 
the police spokesman who requested anonymity said lebanese 
forces engineer units had planted mines along the southern slopes 
of ashrafiyeh and part of the street to hamper any attempt to 
advance 
the thuds of artillery explosions and the whooshing sound of 
outgoing rockets echoed across the lebanese capital 
archbishop nasrallah sfeir patriarch of the maronite catholic 
community called on aoun and geagea to stop shooting 
immediately 
have mercy on people their lives and property are not yours 
you must stop this mass massacre now you must stop this mass 
suicide he said 
in an interview with franceinfo radio hrawi said i call on 
the lebanese of france and overseas to press the country in which 
they are living to intervene to prevent gen aoun from crucifying 
lebanon and the lebanese 
the president also a maronite fled his residence in moslem 
west beirut as as repeated salvos crashed in the district aides 
said 
the renewed fighting violated a truce struck late thursday 
between aoun and geagea and shattered a relative overnight lull in 
east beirut and the rest of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
aoun who has been dismissed as army commander but clings to his 
command of about 20000 soldiers attacked on tuesday to try to 
gain full control of the enclave north and east of beirut where 1 
million christians live geagea has 6000 militiamen bolstered by 
several thousand reservists 
aoun was fired by hrawi who was elected in november under the 
terms of an arab leaguebrokered peace plan aimed at shifting 
political power to the moslem majority and ending a 15yearold 
civil war the war has left 150000 people dead 
aoun says the plan approved by parliament in october provides 
no fixed withdrawal timetable for syrias estimated 45000 troops 
geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord but 
has recognized hrawi as president

world leaders today hailed south africas decision 
to free black leader nelson mandela and legalize the african 
national congress but some urged continued sanctions to encourage 
the dismantling of apartheid 
president bush praised the announcements as quite positive 
and said he will review us sanctions against south africa with 
congressional leaders 
prime minister margaret thatcher immediately invited south 
african president fw de klerk to visit her and said she wants 
mandela to come as soon as he is free bush also has indicated he 
will extend invitations 
mandela 71 has been imprisoned since 1962 for helping to plan 
the start of the ancs bombing and sabotage campaign against the 
whiteled government 
in his speech to south africas parliament de klerk said 
mandela would be freed without conditions but he didnt say when 
he said concerns about mandelas safety were among the factors 
affecting his release date 
de klerks decision to free mandela soon was a historic 
landmark on the road to a new south africa mrs thatcher said in 
a statement 
president de klerk is to be congratulated on his decision 
she said mr mandela will have a major role to play in shaping 
his countrys future 
mrs thatcher who has been instrumental in blocking harsh 
economic sanctions against the whiteled government also said 
britain will in the future not discourage artists scientists and 
academics from going to south africa 
the londonbased antiapartheid movement the biggest in the 
western world said its delight at the legalizing of the anc was 
tinged with concern 
simply reducing the level of apartheid repression does not 
mean he de klerk is committed to ending it antiapartheid 
movement secretary mike terry said 
he said international pressures and black dissent in south 
africa have forced de klerk to move adding these pressures should 
not be relaxed 
he de klerk has gone a long way towards creating a climate 
for negotiations he added but obviously we are bitterly 
disappointed that he has not announced the release of nelson 
mandela 
in contrast the british government statement said the changes 
now taking place in south africa vindicate a policy of contact 
rather than isolation 
in nigeria professor gabriel olusanya directorgeneral of the 
nigerian institute of international affairs called de klerks move 
a a bold and courageous step deserving of encouragement 
although de klerk did not announce the abolition of apartheid 
his refoms pointed toward the eventual end of the hated system 
olusanya said 
it is obvious that with all these measures apartheid will not 
remain what it used to be he said 
canada applauded the speech but cautiouned that much work 
remained before apartheid is dismantled its a historic step in 
the right direction said mark entwistle a spokesman for the 
department of external affairs 
scandinavian countries which were among the first to impose 
sanctions against the whiteled south african government praised 
the decisions 
denmark indicated it may consider upgrading its level of 
diplomatic relations but joined sweden and norway in urging 
continued pressure on south africa to dismantle apartheid its 
system of legalized racial discrimination 
swedish prime minister ingvar carlsson hailed the moves as a 
great victory in the fight against apartheid but said more steps 
were needed for south africa to achieve the full measure of 
democracy and freedom 
until then the struggle against apartheid must continue and 
the pressure on the south africa regime must be kept up carlsson 
said the south african liberation movements can count on 
swedens support in this struggle 
norwegian foreign minister kjell magne bondevik also said oslo 
wont change its policy toward south africa 
many of the oppositions demands have been met but still 
important things remain to be solved first of all elimination of 
the basic foundations of the system of apartheid and the actual 
release from prison of nelson mandela bondevik said 
the finnish foreign ministry in helsinki said that when de 
klerks promises are carried out it will mean a great step in the 
dismantling of apartheid 
portuguese president mario soares who last october became the 
first foreign head of state to visit south africa in nearly 15 
years congratulated de klerk on his announcements 
soares said he heard the news of the decisions with great 
pleasure and a sentiment of profound hope

fourteen children have been 
identified by their parents in nude photographs seized from the 
home of a daycare center owner charged with possession of child 
pornography police said 
john shaver 56 was charged with five counts of possessing 
child pornography after the photographs and magazines were found at 
his home last sunday police say they are considering additional 
charges 
broward county officials on thursday shut down shavers rainbow 
learning center contending shaver lacked good moral character 
fourteen children who attended the daycare center were 
identified by some of the 140 parents who went to the police 
department thursday night and sorted through 200 to 300 pictures 
taken from shavers home 
only the faces of the children were shown to the parents police 
sgt david geyer said the children were pictured naked 
fingerpainting and playing in swimming pools he said no sexual 
situations were depicted police said 
three other children were tentatively identified by their 
parents from among the photographs police said those parents 
planned to take another look at the photos today as did many of 
the other 60 parents who have yet to view the pictures police said 
a weeping marla echevarria whose daughter was not among those 
in the pictures expressed relief but concern for other parents who 
saw their children in the photographs 
the pictures were horrifying she said i saw parents 
hysterical in there 
the children identified in the photographs thursday night were 
undergoing medical examinations and counseling today at the 
countys sexual assault treatment center said police spokesman ott 
cefkin the interviews will be videotaped he added 
no new charges are expected immediately against shaver because 
police must carefully examine the evidence and interview the 
families first he said 
while shaver admits owning the pictures police confiscated he 
does not consider simple possession as pornography 
the way i understand child pornography is to tell kids to take 
off their clothes and photograph them in the nude i didnt do 
it he said its probably done but i am not that way 
it didnt cause harm to anyone he said a lot of people 
have secret vices 
shaver opened the daycare center in 1985 thirty preschool 
children attended the center and about 200 have attended since it 
opened 
i just feel dejected i dont want to do anything shaver 
said after he was notified thursday that the broward county social 
services division revoked his daycare license 
shaver has 15 days to appeal but said he did not want to fight 
it 
i never did anything improper to the children he said 
repeatedly 
when he applied for his license shaver said he wasnt asked 
whether he ever operated a daycare center and did not volunteer 
such information 
in 1984 in hawaii shaver pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge 
of operating a daycare center without a license the plea came a 
year after the state of hawaii revoked his license amid allegations 
that he fondled several young girls at his center 
he was never criminally charged and shaver denies any wrongdoing

violence flared in the kashmir valley on 
friday after an eightday lull and officials said at least four 
people were killed in attacks by moslem separatists and by police 
firing on curfew violators 
prime minister vp singh made his first comments on an 
increasingly belligerent exchange of charges between india and 
pakistan on the kashmir issue saying the indian people and army 
are prepared to give a befitting reply if islamabad wanted a 
confrontation 
singhs comments made in calcutta were reported by united news 
of india new delhi has accused neighboring pakistan an islamic 
state of fomenting the trouble in kashmir islamabad has denied 
the charges but said the people of kashmir had a right to 
selfdetermination 
india and pakistan have gone to war three times since they were 
partitioned in 1947 on gaining independence from britain two of 
the wars have been over kashmir a region claimed by both pakistan 
and india and there have been recent reports of increased military 
activity along the border 
the latest deaths in kashmir raise to 76 the number of people 
killed since the government ordered a crackdown jan 20 on the 
moslem movement for secession of kashmir from predominantly hindu 
india 
in srinagar the largest town in kashmir hindu businessman 
satish kumar tikku was shot and killed by the militants during a 
sixhour relaxation of curfew jammukashmir state gov jagmohan 
told reporters 
tikku was the first hindu civilian known to have been killed in 
the violence other victims have been moslem protesters or 
government troops police sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said tikku was killed because militants suspected him of 
being a police informer and not because he was a hindu 
in the neighboring town of sopore three people were killed when 
paramilitary police opened fire on a mob gathered in defiance of 
curfew restrictions early friday said police officials in jammu 
also speaking on condition of anonymity 
jammu is the winter capital of the moslemmajority state which 
includes the kashmir valley and the plains of jammu to the south 
the last reported deaths in the kashmir valley occurred jan 25 
when at least 15 people were killed two days later the government 
began relaxing the aroundtheclock curfew for varying periods 
extending up to 12 hours a day 
on friday the relaxation was limited to six hours beginning at 
5 am apparently in fear of trouble on the friday moslem sabbath 
frequently a weekly flashpoint for violence by the militants 
a government statement said militants and paramilitary federal 
troops exchanged gunfire in the old district of srinagar and two 
people were wounded it also said two people who hurled a gasoline 
bomb at a paramilitary police bunker were arrested 
the moslem movement for an independent kashmir dates to the 1947 
partition of the subcontinent along religious lines the hindu 
ruler of the state opted to join india but pakistan opposed the 
decision saying as a moslemmajority area it should have gone to 
pakistan 
a war over the issue in 1948 left parts of the valley under 
pakistani control 
kashmiri militants at first demanded union with pakistan but 
recently they have demanded a separate neutral nation which if 
formed would be sandwiched next to india pakistan and china 
meanwhile the government declined to enforce an order expelling 
reporters for the associated press and agence francepresse from 
srinagar they had been ordered expelled on the grounds their 
presence was prejudicial to the security of the state

if the nation needs another sign that the drug 
problem is getting worse veterinarians have one 
animal doctors in the atlanta area say they are treating an 
increasing number of patients who are disoriented having seizures 
in a coma or undergoing cardiac arrest because they ate their 
owners drugs 
oh we see it all the time said darryl mickle who 
practices in a clinic in southeastern atlanta 
he told of a dachshund muffin who was brought in disoriented 
and salivating heavily 
is it possible that muffin got hold of some type of plant or 
uh medication mickle asked diplomatically 
the owner said no but mickle traced the problem to an overdose 
you know i thought it was my roommate who had stolen my 
marijuana but it was muffin the man later admitted 
mickle estimated his clinic sees two pets a month that have 
eaten illegal drugs plus another two a month that swallowed a 
prescription drug alcohol or an overthecounter remedy 
the illinois animal poison information center which has the 
only national 24hour hot line for pets handled 85 calls in 1988 
for animals that had consumed marijuana said operations director 
harold trammel 
cocaine and alcohol ingestion were second with 35 calls each 
and other calls came in for prescription drug consumption 
amphetamines hallucinogens such as lsd and even one for heroin 
last month rob lafferty of the veterinary medical center in 
alpharetta treated a sheepdog that had eaten its owners marijuana 
he said he gave the animal a drug that induces vomiting and about 
the equivalent of a nickel bag came up 
jason trotman a veterinarian with the 24hour animal emergency 
care center in smyrna said a man last month brought in a miniature 
schnauzer that was in cardiac arrest from cocaine the man said the 
dog belonged to a friend 
the dog died and when trotman tried to contact the man the 
name address and telephone number he had left all turned out to be 
phony 
both trotman and mickle said they do not report drug cases to 
police 
my main concern is saving the animals life not getting into 
the owners personal affairs trotman said 
but for every animal taken to a veterinarian more probably are 
never treated because owners are afraid of being prosecuted for 
possession veterinarians say 
trotman said he often gets anonymous calls from people seeking 
advice on how to help a pet that consumed cocaine or marijuana 
when the owners are told they have to bring the dog in for proper 
treatment they usually hang up he said

a new study indicates that weight 
distribution plays a role in the risk of breast cancer with 
apple shapes having a greater risk than women with 
pearshaped bodies 
women can gauge their risk of breast cancer by dividing their 
waist measurements by their hip measurements researchers from the 
university of south florida said in a study published thursday in 
the philadelphiabased annals of internal medicine 
in a separate study texas researchers said they have identified 
an enzyme that may help predict which breastcancer patients are 
most likely to suffer a relapse 
breast cancer is expected to strike an estimated 150000 women 
and cause 44000 deaths this year 
the florida study led by david schapira of the h lee moffitt 
cancer center amp research institute at the university of south 
florida found that women who carry their weight around the middle 
are more at risk for developing breast cancer than those who bulge 
at the hips and thighs 
when we looked at women obesity was not a factor its where 
you have the fat schapira said an overweight pear is still at 
lower risk than someone leaner and apple shaped 
this refines our information said oncologist dr paul f 
engstrom of the fox chase cancer center not all obesity is the 
same 
previous studies had established a link between obesity and 
breast cancer but schapira said this may be because women tend to 
gain weight in their abdomen 
fat cells in the upper part of the body he said are larger and 
have a different metabolic and hormonal structure than those in the 
lower part of the body 
the florida team studied 216 breastcancer patients diagnosed 
from august 1987 to june 1988 and 432 healthy women the subjects 
ranged in age from 25 to 83 
breastcancer patients had significantly greater deposits of 
upper body fat plus greater waisttohip and abdomentothigh 
ratios researchers found 
schapira said women whose waisttohip ratio is 077 to 080 are 
classified as mildly apple shaped and are three times as likely 
to develop breast cancer a risk equal to having either a sister or 
mother who had breast cancer 
women whose ratio is higher than 080 are very apple shaped 
schapira said and are six times as likely to develop breast 
cancer a risk equal to having both a mother and sister who had 
breast cancer 
ratios of 073 to 076 define a woman as mildly pear shaped 
while women with ratios of less than 073 are very pear shaped 
and at low risk of getting breast cancer he said 
last week researchers in st louis reported that cholesterol 
levels are closely linked with the way people carry their fat 
reporting it is healthier for people to be shaped like a pear than 
an apple 
the second study published thursday in the new england journal 
of medicine said the presence of an enzyme called cathepsin d 
could help doctors determine which women should receive 
chemotherapy or radiation treatment after breastcancer surgery 
the enzyme appears to play a part in the rapid production of 
cancer cells according to the study 
doctors at the university of texas health science center in san 
antonio found that breast cancer patients with higher levels of the 
enzyme had 26 times the chance of a relapse and 39 times the 
possibility of dying in five years compared with those who had low 
levels 
measurement of the detection of the enzyme may help doctors 
shape treatment for breastcancer victims who dont show signs of 
further cancer 
about 30 percent of the patients experience a recurrence and 
until now doctors have been unable to predict which women are at 
risk 
the national cancer institute recommends chemotherapy for all 
women not showing signs of further disease

orders from reputed mob boss john gotti testified today he did not 
know the men who shot him 
john f oconnor subpoenaed as a defense witness detailed what 
happened when he was shot in the buttocks on may 7 1986 
oconnor 56 of brewster said he noticed four or five men 
hanging around the offices of carpenters union local 608 where he 
was then business manager 
while waiting for the elevator oconnor said he heard a 
thunderous clap and felt something in his buttocks although he 
did not realize he had been shot 
he said someone shouted his name and he turned and saw a man 
pointing a gun at him and that when he got on the elevator the 
gunman fired more bullets into his buttocks 
the prosecution rested its case thursday after the jury heard

gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 60 are on charged with 
assault and conspiracy in the retaliation shooting of oconnor

featherstone in jail 
at one point on the tape kelly said one gang member popped 
him 
when featherstone asked who requested the shooting kelly 
replied it was done for the greaseballs he said the westies 
volunteered their services to gotti at the funeral of gambino 
family underboss frank decicco 
defense attorneys have challenged the quality of the tapes and 
the veracity of the transcripts 
acting justice edward mclaughlin told the jurors that what they 
hear on the tapes and how they interpret it is what counts he said 
he was not sure he would allow them to take the transcripts into 
the jury room during deliberations 
mclaughlin told the jurors they will hear closing arguments 
monday and begin deliberations tuesday

the board voted 133 instead to accept the recommendation of uw 
system president kenneth shaw that the university strengthen its 
effort to lobby congress to change the militarys policy 
in december the faculty senate at uwmadison the systems 
largest campus approved a resolution asking the university to 
expel rotc from campus in 1993 if the military continued to 
prohibit gays and lesbians several other campus groups followed 
with similar resolutions 
but shaw responded this week by saying he did not believe 
severing the universitys ties to the military would effectively 
encourage the military to change its policy furthermore 
elimination of the military programs would hurt those students who 
benefit from them he said 
there are about 440 students in army navy and air force rotc 
programs at uwmadison which has an enrollment of 42000 and a 
total of about 1300 rotc students in the entire uw system which 
has 135000 students at 13 major campuses and several smaller 
centers 
the regents listened to testimony from 15 people before voting 
in favor of shaws resolution which called on the university to 
step up efforts it began in 1987 to lobby congress and the military 
i think it was the appropriate resolution to pass said 
regent erroll davis jr of madison i think we have to work a 
little harder than in the past this resolution keeps the issue in 
the front line and will force us to deal with it 
the resolution passed today differs from one approved by the 
regents in 1987 because it requires uw administrators to report 
annually to the board on the progress of its lobbying efforts to 
change the militarys policy 
the 1987 resolution which stated the university would seek to 
lobby the military was criticized recently for being too broad and 
ineffective 
the majority of regents said they agreed with shaw that kicking 
the military off campus would not effect the change sought in a 
national policy 
by opting out we will have nothing to say about this issue 
shaw told the regents its an issue that must be changed 
legislatively 
an official at the armys rotc office at uwmadison who 
declined to give his name said rotc officials would decline to 
comment until seeing a copy of the regents decision 
jordan marsh of the wisconsin student association said he was 
dissapointed by the regents vote but was encouraged by some of the 
members comments some regents said they would want rotc banned if 
the lobbying to change military policy fails 
it shows they are serious about this and want the 
discrimination stopped he said

treasury secretary nicholas f brady tried to 
distance the bush administration today from its earlier calls for 
lower interest rates saying those remarks were aimed at a 
homebuilders convention 
bradys comments were an indication the white house may be 
trying to ease the pressure it has been placing in recent weeks on 
the federal reserve board to take actions to lower interest rates 
testifying before the joint economic committee of congress 
brady said a statement made two weeks ago by white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater urging lower rates was not meant to be a contest 
with the fed 
brady said he understood fitzwater was aiming his remark at a 
visit president bush was scheduled to make the next day to a 
homebuilders convention the housing industry has been in a slump 
for the past year due to high mortgage rates 
presidents generally talk about lower interest rates at 
housing conferences brady said 
the white house generally refrains from commenting publicly on 
federal reserve policy 
asked by committee chairman lee hamilton dind whether 
fitzwaters comments were inappropriate brady said not in light 
of what i understand was the reason for the statement being given 
brady said he holds vigorous discussions weekly with fed 
chairman alan greenspan in which disagreements are expressed but 
he declined to reveal the specifics of their talks 
the administration probably has a bias toward growth thats 
greater than that of the fed brady said at the same time we 
keep a weather eye on inflation 
bradys remarks today came only four days before federal reserve 
policymakers were scheduled to hold a closeddoor session in 
washington where they will set monetary targets for the rest of the 
year 
on jan 18 fitzwater told white house reporters that a recent 
prime rate reduction by banks had not been passed through to the 
general economy he said its important occasionally to point 
out that lower interest rates are normally good for the economy 
fitzwater went on to cite commerce department statistics showing 
a drop in housing starts as evidence that lower interest rates are 
needed 
the next day in atlanta bush told the national association of 
homebuilders that he wants interest rates to drop further 
the truth is theres one housing policy and one sales 
strategy thats better than all others combined a healthy growing 
economy with low longterm interest rates bush said

china on friday strongly protested us 
legislation imposing trade sanctions on china saying congress had 
wilfully trampled on the basic norms governing international 
relations 
the protest was lodged by vice foreign minister liu huaqiu in a 
meeting with us ambassador james lilley the official xinhua news 
agency reported 
liu said he had been instructed to express our utmost 
indignation and lodge a strong protest against the hegemonist 
act of the us congress which basing its legislation on rumors 
has wilfully trampled on the basic norms governing international 
relations and wantonly interfered in chinas internal affairs 
the sanctions bill passed wednesday by a 980 vote in the 
senate after earlier approval by the house was expected to be 
signed into law by president bush 
the legislation however is largely symbolic reflecting 
actions bush took earlier following the bloody military crackdown 
of the studentled prodemocracy movement in china last spring 
the bill gives the president the power to waive the measures if 
he deems it in the national interest or if he can show congress 
there have been human rights improvements in china 
the sanctions measures were originally part of a state 
department spending authoritization bill that bush vetoed in 
november because of a separate dispute concerning the irancontra 
affair 
the sanctions suspend financial underwriting for us companies 
investing in china and aid under the trade and development program 
sales of military and crime control equipment are stopped and 
controls are put on export of usbuilt satellites and nuclear 
cooperation 
the legislation also calls for a review of chinas most favored 
nation trading status if repression against political dissidents 
continues 
bush has already eased some sanctions including the ban on 
export of us satellites citing improved conditions in china 
bush also won a victory for his policy of keeping the door open 
to better uschina relations when the senate last week sustained 
his veto of a bill protecting chinese students from deportation 
the president said the bill was unnecessary because he had 
already taken administrative measures to protect students worried 
about persecution upon their return to china 
chinas strong response to the sanctions bill however 
reflected the governments intense dislike of foreign criticism and 
its past acknowledgments that sanctions have hurt the chinese 
economy 
certain us congressmen addicted to bias and disregarding 
the realities have readopted the amendment on sanctions against 
china liu said this can only reveal their stubborn antichina 
position and their true nature of pushing power politics 
he said chinas road to socialist modernization will not be 
deterred by economic sanctions and the us actions are just like 
lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet in the end it is 
the interests of the united states itself that will be harmed 
liu said the us government has an unshirkable responsibility 
for the unbridled antichina wave stirred up by the us congress 
he said china welcomes us statements that it hopes to see 
relations returned to a positive course but the lifting of the 
sanctions is a necessary condition for the return to normal of 
the bilateral relations

a ranking military source said friday the 
army had captured a strategic airstrip in southeastern angola after 
a fierce battle but a rebel spokesman in lisbon denied it 
the military source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the mavinga airstrip fell thursday after air force bombardment and 
fighting that caused heavy casualties on both sides 
he said two columns of soldiers had consolidated positions in 
all the area of mavinga including the airstrip and all other 
important points 
mavinga is considered a key to military control of the region 
and vital to any government plans to attack the rebel stronghold at 
jamba 120 miles farther south 
norberto de castro rebel spokesman in lisbon portugal said a 
dispatch from jonas savimbi chief of the unita rebels reported 
continued heavy fighting more than 15 miles from mavinga 
there has been no government comment on the operation 
savimbi whose groups full name is the national union for the 
total independence of angola cut short a fivenation european tour 
tuesday to return to angola he ordered the rebels on general alert 
friday for fullscale operations against government forces 
according to the rebel radio monitored in luanda savimbi said 
his call for an allout attack was in response to heavy 
shelling of mavinga by government troops 
he said the assault would include urban guerrilla attacks 
intended to make angolan cities uncontrollable over the next 
two months the radio reported 
in lisbon de castro confirmed government troops crossed the 
lomba river a rebel defense line that passes as near as 12 miles 
to mavingas north 
a western diplomat who follows the 15year old conflict from 
lisbon said government forces were within about half a mile of 
mavinga on thursday afternoon but were short on supplies and might 
not attack jamba immediately 
an estimated 10000 soldiers began a drive on mavinga late in 
december from the government base at cuito cuanavale about 100 
miles to the northwest other government units were said to be 
advancing from the west 
western diplomats in luanda said the government could use the 
capture of mavinga to strengthen their position in new ceasefire 
talks 
diplomats from the united states soviet union portugal and 
several african nations have been trying to revive negotiations for 
an end to the civil war which has continued since independence 
from portugal in 1975 
a ceasefire agreement sealed between savimbi and president jose 
eduardo dos santos last june broke down within days 
savimbi demands free elections as a condition for peace dos 
santos offers the rebels an amnesty and integration in a oneparty 
marxist state run by his popular movement for the liberation of 
angola which has controlled the government since 1975

costa rica an oasis of democracy in 
central america celebrates its 10th straight peaceful presidential 
election sunday with a youthful twotime loser as the narrow 
favorite 
the election pits rafael angel calderon 40 who founded the 
social christian unity party in 1984 against carlos manuel 
castillo 61 of the national liberation party that has dominated 
the presidency since 1948 
well win because the country doesnt want to keep the same 
party in power all the time and because our organization has more 
energy than theirs said calderon in an interview after a 
campaignclosing rally thursday night 
the national liberation party has won seven of nine presidential 
races since 1948 incumbent oscar arias who could not succeed 
himself beat calderon in 1986 
calderon is considered the narrow favorite although by 
agreement between the parties and the supreme electoral council no 
polls have been conducted since dec 10 when calderon had a 5 
percent lead with 20 percent undecided 
more than 80 percent of the 16 millionmember electorate is 
expected to vote with the winner taking office on may 8 
voters will also elect 525 mayors and 57 deputies to the 
unicameral national assembly 
the campaign has been relatively bland with issues such as 
corruption and drug trafficking backpedaled by both major parties 
castillo was hurt when his mentor former president daniel 
oduber admitted accepting a party contribution of more than 
100000 in 1986 from a man charged with drug trafficking in the 
united states 
calderon denies accusations that he received even more money 
from manuel antonio noriega and both say pervasive administrative 
corruption is one of their top concerns 
both have also said they will continue to support the central 
american peace process but neither has the moral authority of an 
arias who won a nobel peace prize for his efforts 
the costa rican economy has been damaged by instability in el 
salvador nicaragua and panama which made investors reluctant to 
put money into any country in the region 
confidence has been partially restored by an agreement that 
helped reduce the impact of the nations 55 billion foreign debt 
one of the worlds highest per capita along with the downfall 
of noriega and elections in nicaragua 
costa rica is considered a staunch us ally and us aid runs 
about 90 million a year 
in contrast to the rest of central america this country of 
about 29 million has experienced peaceful elections every four 
years since 1948 when calderons father was exiled for trying to 
upset that years result 
after a 40day revolution the calderon family was packed off to 
exile and the army was eliminated 
rafael calderon himself was born in nicaragua and didnt live in 
costa rica until he was 15 
castillos literature refers to calderons background glancingly 
by saying castillo represents the ideal of what it means to be 
costa rican which in his case includes graduate study in 
economics at the universities of wisconsin and tennessee 
calderon got 33 percent of the vote in 1982 while running for 
his fathers party the calderon republicans before he founded his 
own party 
he said he would view victory partially as vindication of his 
father and partially as the result of a growing party with a 
strong mystique 
there are five minor candidates who are not expected to affect 
the outcome although one attracted some attention last week when 
he was arrested on charges of child molesting charges he denied 
the minor parties complain that the major candidates are 
offering similar platforms and that costa rica suffers from a 
twoparty dictatorship to the detriment of costa rican 
pluralism

chief justice william h rehnquist made a 
pitch friday for more us stamps depicting past supreme court 
members as he helped dedicate a stamp commemorating the courts 
200th anniversary 
the new stamp depicts john marshall the fourth chief justice 
whose likeness has appeared on postage stamps three times 
previously 
when it comes to members of the court who were not john 
marshall the pickings are slim rehnquist said during a ceremony 
at a largerthanlife statue of marshall in the supreme court 
building 
postmaster general anthony m frank responded i get lobbied 
for stamps all the time but i have never been lobbied more 
graciously 
noting that some 700000 lawyers are doing business across the 
nation frank quipped if they would use stamps instead of faxes 
we could accommodate some of your wishes 
of rehnquists 15 predecessors in the chief justices post four 
besides marshall have been depicted on stamps john jay william 
howard taft harlan fisk stone and charles evans hughes 
two associate justices have been honored oliver wendell holmes 
jr and hugo black 
for those who are associate justices theres some hope but 
not a great deal rehnquist said as justice william j brennan 
and retired justice lewis f powell chuckled in the audience 
there may be some who will feel that john marshall has already 
had more than his share of stamps depicting him as compared with 
other distinguished members of this court and other distinguished 
americans rehnquist said 
but this issue is designed to represent the judicial branch of 
the united states government he said and no one person embodies 
that branch more than marshall who served as chief justice from 
1801 to 1835 
he came to a court that was weak and insignificant 
rehnquist said when marshall left the court it was a 
vigorous and coequal branch of the government with its power of 
judicial review firmly established 
the marshall depiction apparently was not the postal services 
first design choice for the court bicentennial stamp 
frank said that when an initial design was shown to rehnquist 
he opined that he hated it 
when rehnquist suggested depicting marshall frank mentioned 
that marshall had been on three previous stamps 
the chief justice said a fourth will not be amiss frank 
said

west germanys foreign minister today said he 
is seeking support from the four world war ii allies for german 
unification and the soviet union proposed europeans americans and 
canadians vote on the issue 
in an interview published today in moscow soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze said the outside groups should vote 
or hold wide parliamentary discussions because they suffered so 
much from a unified germany in world war ii 
the soviet envoy gave the kremlins strongest endorsement yet to 
unification but repeated conditions that this must not destabilize 
europe the interview was carried by the official soviet news 
agency tass 
the west german official hansdietrich genscher made his 
comments in a radio interview before flying to washington to 
discuss the prospect of unification with secretary of state james 
a baker iii 
genscher said he also was consulting with british and french 
officials and would meet with shevardnadze next week 
east germanys premier hans modrow on thursday outlined a plan 
for a united fatherland that would be governed from berlin but 
would remain militarily neutral 
genscher joined chancellor helmut kohl in rejecting neutrality 
for the future german state but he also said that east germany a 
member of the warsaw pact should not be drawn into nato 
uniting the two germanys has become likely since a prodemocracy 
revolution ousted hardline east german leader erich honecker on 
oct 18 opened the berlin wall formed a coaltion government and 
scheduled elections in march 
earlier in the week genscher had said a reunited germany should 
remain a member of the north atlantic treaty organization but the 
territory of east germany should not be part of the western 
alliances military structure 
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio genscher also called 
for the european security conference which includes the united 
states to convene this year to give the dramatic developments in 
east and central europe a stable framework the conference he 
said should also discuss german unification 
kohl said in a statement issued by his office in bonn on 
thursday that he would agree to talks with east german leaders as 
soon as a new government is elected on march 18 
but he added i strongly reject the concept of german 
neutrality 
west germany is home to much of the wests military might 
officials in both germanys welcomed president bushs proposal to 
cut superpower troops in central europe to 195000 on each side to 
correspond to a recent diminishing of tensions between nato and its 
rival warsaw pact 
modrows government predicted the white house initiative would 
speed a conventional armed forces reduction being negotiated in 
vienna 
modrow called for a reasonable time horizon for 
reunification to be determined by an intergerman dialogue 
the premiers reunification plan marked a turnaround in the 
communistdominated governments position on the german question 
the east berlin leadership had previously resisted reunification 
efforts as premature and destabilizing 
but mounting economic woes and an accelerating exodus of skilled 
workers to the west are forcing the nations interim leaders to 
address public pressure for a merger with prosperous west germany

fur hats are no longer the real thing 
following protests from animal lovers and ecologists including 
the minister of state for environment the prime minister has been 
sporting a new line of headgear made from synthetic fur 
some things are done without the awareness of the 
background singh said in a letter addressed to diana ratnagar 
who heads the indian branch of beauty without cruelty an 
international animal rights trust founded in britain in 1959 
i have always stood for those who are voiceless therefore my 
decision to switch to an artificial fur cap as soon as i was 
informed of the cruelty involved singhs letter said 
the prime minister who took office two months ago frequently 
was photographed wearing a curly dark karakul lamb hat prompting 
protest letters and gossipcolumn notes in the indian press in the 
past week he has been seen wearing fake fur 
ms ratnagar and several of the letter writers said karakul 
lambs were slaughtered within 48 hours of their birth or 
deliberately aborted before birth in order for the hatmakers to 
obtain their hides before the curls straightened out 
ms ratnagar said friday her group had given singh one synthetic 
karakul hat and two other fake fur hats 
we felt it was wrong for the prime minister to be wearing 
karakul caps she said wearing fur today is a moral issue and 
we feel that people shouldnt be imitating him by wearing these 
caps

thousands of illegal aliens who are spouses or 
children of legalized immigrants will be allowed to stay in this 
country under a new policy unveiled today by immigration 
commissioner gene mcnary 
the new policy announced by mcnary reverses a threeyearold 
practice of admitting only those family members for compelling 
humanitarian reasons 
mcnary said the previous policy was not being administered 
evenhandedly by ins district offices and as a result split families 
we can enforce the law humanely mcnary told reporters at a 
briefing to split families simply encourages further violation 
of the law as they illegal aliens attempt to reunite mcnary 
said 
under the new policy spouses and unmarried children of a 
legalized immigrant will be allowed to remain in this country if 
they resided here on nov 6 1986 the day the immigration reform 
and control act took effect 
the law granted blanket amnesty to illegal aliens who could 
prove they were residing in the country before jan 1 1982 it 
also provided immigrant status to undocumented farm workers who 
could prove they worked 90 days picking crops in this country 
during any of three years 
more than 3 million illegal aliens have been granted amnesty 
under the 1986 law 
the new policy effects the spouses and children of aliens who 
received legal resident status under the 1986 law these people 
typically followed their relatives to this country but did not 
arrive in time to qualify for amnesty and are still illegal aliens 
under the reagan administration policy reversed by mcnary ins 
deported only a small number of people following casebycase 
reviews of some 10000 applicants 
but mcnary said that policy has not been evenly and uniformly 
enforced throughout the country as some district directors were 
very lenient and other ones were very strict 
the new policy should encourage more people to apply for the 
extended voluntary departure status which allows qualified aliens 
to remain in this country while awaiting permission to immigrate 
the only difference is they will wait in this country instead of 
their homeland he said 
these aliens will be given work permits and will be eligible to 
collect social welfare benefits but yearly reviews of each alien 
will be conducted to ensure they are productive citizens 
those who commit crimes or become public charges by 
depending on welfare would be subject to deportation 
mcnary said the new order is in line with legislation that has 
passed the senate and is awaiting action in the house 
the new policy was criticized by the federation for american 
immigration reform as just plain illegal 
it ignores congressional intent and undermines the delicate 
compromise crafted over a decade of national debate its 
overbroad arbitrary capricious and illegal said dan stein 
the groups executive director 
at issue here said stein is who defines the basic 
immigration law congress and the american people or the 
bureaucrats and pressure groups that surround them its an open 
invitation for future illegal immigration

a thin line of white police on 
friday silently watched the pulsating throng of singing and 
chanting blacks celebrating the legalization of the african 
national congress 
small groups of glumlooking white civilians stood behind the 
police staring at the jubilant blacks waving the organizations 
black green and gold flag as they chanted anc anc 
other whites eyes cast down walked quickly past the exuberant 
blacks the police who broke up a peaceful demonstration in 
central cape town on wednesday made no move to block the crowd 
friday 
white reaction to president fw de klerks announcement of 
sweeping reforms appeared subdued and uncertain de klerk legalized 
the anc and other outlawed antiapartheid groups and called for 
talks with blacks on ending south africas racial divisions 
andries treurnicht leader of the proapartheid conservative 
party called for a referendum on de klerks proposals 
it was the most revolutionary speech to which i have listened 
in this parliament said treurnicht he gave no indication 
whatsoever in the september general election that he intends 
making such sweeping announcements today and we say he has no 
mandate for doing the drastic things he intends doing and we 
challenge him to call a general election 
de klerk is unlikely to heed the call he said after the 
september voting that 70 percent of the white electorate supported 
his plans to end apartheid and negotiate a new constitution with 
blacks de klerk included the antiapartheid democratic party 
voters in his calculations 
democratic party coleader zach de beer said de klerks speech 
was a great event of course the road ahead will be steep and 
rough and theres a possibility of setbacks and problems but taken 
all in all i have more hope for south africa at this moment than 
ive had for 40 years 
although de klerk did not commit himself to ending white rule 
some whites expressed concern about their future in south africa 
after centuries of white domination 
some said they were afraid of being swamped by blacks in a mass 
democracy or of being under black rule 
as a south african i have reservations said michael loor a 
white businessman whites are feeling a bit insecure there is 
reservation in the hearts of whites 
there was little talk about de klerks speech in several 
fashionable restaurants where the solidly white clientele dressed 
in business suits and chic dresses chatted over long lunches some 
people said they did not want to spoil lunch with talk about 
politics 
shoppers and businessmen hurrying along the smart streets of the 
city center appeared mostly unaware of the black crowds celebrating 
on the nearby harbor front 
a white police officer watching the black celebrations said he 
was glad the state of emergency was being partly lifted but he 
expressed doubt about any future plans to share power with blacks 
to my mind blacks are good people but there is a certain 
element that doesnt want everything to flow freely said the 
officer who declined to give his name 
a businessman who also did not want to be identified said he 
believed de klerk was seeking a peaceful solution to ensure the 
rights of all south africans and would guarantee the safety of 
whites 
de klerk is a good man he wont do the wrong thing for us 
the man said 
a few whites mostly young students mingled with the black 
marchers waving anc banners and dancing and clapping they 
expressed hope that de klerk and the white minority were serious 
about radical change that would usher in democracy and end white 
rule 
but some expressed reservations saying de klerk had not spelled 
out a commitment to ending white rule and had declined to reveal 
the governments position on the future of south african government 
and society 
its quite guarded the speech when you read it said one 
young man with a long blond pony tail before he was swept away in 
the crowd

a former politburo member and hardliner was 
expelled from the communist party for using his influence to buy a 
mercedesbenz at a great discount official media said friday 
the harsh action against a conservative member of the partys 
central committee comes just three days before the committee holds 
a critical meeting that is expected to bring heated debate between 
progressives and conservatives 
the expulsion of yuri solovyov who was a nonvoting member of 
the politburo until his demotion last summer must be confirmed by 
the central committee when it meets monday and tuesday said 
vladimir kiryanov of the leningrad partys press office 
if his ouster is upheld solovyov will lose his pension and 
numerous other privileges kiryanov said 
it was the second attack this week on a prominent hardline 
communist the weekly moscow news on thursday attacked politburo 
member yegor k ligachev and accused him of lying and clinging to 
outdated socialist ideals 
solovyov former leningrad party chief was retired last summer 
during a meeting of the leningrad party organization attended by 
president mikhail s gorbachev solovyov had been criticized for 
resisting gorbachevs reforms 
last spring solovyov suffered a humiliating defeat in the vote 
for parliament despite having no opposition when more than 50 
percent of the voters crossed his lone name off the ballot 
solovyov bought a luxurious mercedes in december for a 
practically symbolic price even less than the cost of a new 
sovietmade zhiguli the government newspaper izvestia 
reported he was expelled for violating party ethics because he did 
not follow the rules on car purchases kiryanov said 
another reason he was kicked out was immodesty izvestia 
said 
the official news agency tass implied that solovyov abused his 
position to obtain the vehicle but kiryanov refused to elaborate 
top communists have enjoyed special privileges such as foreign cars 
and luxury food allotments for decades but gorbachev has pushed 
for social fairness that has eliminated some privileges 
former soviet leader leonid i brezhnev who has been 
discredited and blamed for economic stagnation and corruption had 
a great love of western automobiles 
tass implied that others in the generally conservative leningrad 
party leadership might be threatened by the scandal it said the 
local prosecutor had been asked to investigate whether other 
communist leaders bought their cars illegally neither tass nor 
kiryanov explained the precise violation 
izvestia specifically named former leningrad vicemayor g bukin 
as another involved in the scandal for acquiring an almostnew 
audi 
solovyov was expelled at an emergency meeting of the leningrad 
party committee on thursday the day after the sensational 
leningrad tv program 600 seconds broadcast a report showing 
solovyovs name on an auto registration list journalist alexander 
nevzorov told viewers it had become easy to buy a mercedesbenz for 
9780 rubles 
rubles are worthless on the international market so such a 
statement implies the soviet government took rubles from the buyers 
and paid for the cars from its scarce store of foreign currency 
nevzorov noted in the broadcast that 9780 rubles is lower even 
than the state price for a sovietmade volga editor alexander 
borisoglebsky confirmed friday 
shortages require normal wouldbe buyers to wait years or pay a 
vastly higher blackmarket price privileged people in the soviet 
union however can skip to the head of the line 
the 9780 rubles are worth about 16000 at the commercial 
exchange rate and about onetenth of that at the rate for tourists 
and other individuals 
solovyov acquired a mercedes 280s borisoglebsky said that 
model was last produced in 1985 and cost about 23000 without 
taxes in west germany 
solovyov 64 is former construction engineer on the leningrad 
subway he began fulltime party work in 1974 as a secretary in the 
leningrad regional party committee he became leningrad party chief 
in 1985 and a candidate member of the politburo in 1986 during 
gorbachevs tenure as party chief

an inmate pleaded innocent friday to a renewed 
murder charge in the 1976 carbomb slaying of an investigative 
reporter for the arizona republic 
james robison 67 of chandler was convicted of killing don 
bolles in 1977 but the conviction was reversed on appeal robison 
remained in prison on an unrelated conviction and was still there 
when attorney general bob corbin filed the new murder charge last 
fall 
maricopa county superior court judge thomas otoole set trial 
april 19 
in addition to the murder charge corbins office has been 
working with a state grand jury investigating a possible conspiracy 
to obstruct earlier investigations of the bolles probe 
the grand jurys work is secret but there are indications that 
phoenix attorney neal roberts is a potential target roberts was 
granted limited immunity early in the police investigation but he 
told the phoenix gazette this week he had brought his lawyer with 
him to the latest grand jury probe 
under arizona law the only grand jury witnesses who can be 
accompanied by lawyers are those the state designates as potential 
targets of the grand jury 
roberts told police in 1976 that he had arranged a charter 
flight and motel room for john harvey adamson a greyhound breeder 
and towtruck operator who has acknowledged planting the fatal bomb 
and has claimed that robison triggered it by remote control 
roberts has said he had nothing to do with bolles death 
adamson testified at robisons initial trial in return for 
leniency robison and another man were convicted but an appeals 
court threw out the convictions because the defense wasnt allowed 
to question a witness adequately adamson then demanded a better 
deal before he would agree to testify at the new trial 
arguing that adamsons refusal to testify again broke the plea 
bargain corbin brought adamson to trial and won a firstdegree 
murder conviction and a death sentence he hoped would persuade 
adamson to talk adamsons death sentence was thrown out by a 
federal appeals court earlier this year 
corbin now says he has enough evidence to proceed against 
robison without adamsons help 
bolles died june 13 1976 11 days after his car was blown up in 
a hotel parking lot a motive for the slaying has never been 
established

the original baby shamu the first killer 
whale born and raised successfully in captivity will be taken away 
from her mother this month to become the star of her own sea world 
show in ohio 
floridas department of natural resources has authorized the 
separation and transfer from the sea world marine park in orlando 
the first time a captive killer whale has been intentionally 
separated from its mother state officials say federal wildlife 
officials also agreed to the move 
the company doesnt expect the move to affect either the mother 
or her 5yearold offspring a sea world spokesman said thursday 
we really anticipate no problems at all said nick 
gollatscheck 
researchers who study the marine mammals in the wild say they 
live in pods or groups related on the mothers side many believe 
killer whale offspring remain with their mothers throughout their 
lifetime but some biologists dispute this theory 
ed asper zoological director for the orlando sea world said 
the bonds between baby shamu and her mother katina have weakened 
because the mother has since had another offspring 
in addition to baby shamu now known by the stage name of shamu 
the florida park has five other killer whales 
the aurora ohio sea world now has two killer whales one of 
those animals will be moved to another of the sea world parks but 
company officials would not say which one 
sea world applied for a state permit to move the whale last 
month and the agency conducted an investigation before granting a 
transport permit 
the primary concern was the condition of the facilities at sea 
world in ohio said charles futch an assistant director of 
marine resources for dnr in tallahassee 
an inspection certificate signed thursday by the animal and 
plant health inspection service a branch of the us agriculture 
department concluded that killer whale tanks in ohio met federal 
standards 
the dnr then approved the move to take place by feb 28 
shamu and two pacific whitesided dolphins will be placed in 
special stretchers and flown to the aurora park which will open 
for the season around memorial day officials said

african national congress leaders 
praised south africas decision friday to legalize the guerrilla 
group but said the government would remain a global outcast until 
it ends apartheid 
victory is in sight said anc leader walter sisulu although 
he declined to describe the whiterun government as committed to 
ending racial segregation they have made a progressive beginning 
and on the basis of that i am hopeful that they will go farther 
president fw de klerk said that he was legalizing the anc 
lifting bans or restrictions on more than 60 other organizations 
and freeing most people who had been jailed for joining them when 
they were banned 
de klerk told parliament in cape town that he was relaxing state 
of emergency restrictions and would soon free jailed anc leader 
nelson mandela he did not say when mandela would be freed saying 
more time was needed to settle issues related to his safety 
sisulu praised the changes but said they were only preliminary 
talks to end south africas decades of racial conflict could not 
yet begin he said and sanctions against the government should 
remain 
an anc statement said south africas main black nationalist 
movement remained greatly concerned that some political 
prisoners would not be freed detentions without trial could 
continue and some emergency regulations would remain 
these decisions must be reviewed and changed without 
delay the anc said 
the statement said mandela who has served 27 years in jail for 
plotting against white rule should be freed immediately it 
rejected de klerks expressed concern for mandelas personal 
security outside of prison and said the anc should share 
responsibility for the 71yearold leaders safety 
sisulu and other top anc leaders were in stockholm on a 
scandinavian tour the first visit outside africa for six elderly 
anc figures since their recent release from life sentences in south 
africa 
the group visited anc president oliver tambo who is recovering 
from a stroke in a stockholm clinic and sought to resume personal 
contacts with scandinavian governments which have long been among 
the ancs strongest backers 
an anc spokesman said secretarygeneral alfred nzo and joe 
slovo head of the south african communist party and former head of 
the ancs armed wing were also expected in sweden late friday 
their presence raised the possibility that an urgent review of the 
south african situation promised by the anc as a result of de 
klerks announcements would begin over the weekend 
in its statement the anc leadership said it would consult with 
the mass democratic movement the main alliance of antiapartheid 
groups within south africa as well as other allies in the country 
the review of the new situation will include an assessment of 
the prospects of genuine negotiations to end the apartheid 
system the anc said 
it urged the world community meanwhile to do nothing to 
lessen the isolation of the apartheid regime 
although the anc has conceded that its guerrilla operations 
inside south africa have had little effect it has in the past 
refused to abandon the armed struggle sisulu said that the 
continuation of violence by the anc will have to be discussed 
as part of its policy review 
asked whether negotiations with the government could begin 
sisulu said no this is only the beginning 
he said the government should remove soldiers from black 
townships in south africa and should clarify the question of 
whether political exiles such as tambo were now free to return 
home 
sisulu said he doubted de klerk had placed himself at political 
risk despite opposition by the white conservative party to any 
concessions to blacks he said he believed that the conservative 
movement has already reached the zenith of its power in south 
africa

the nations unemployment rate held steady at 
53 percent for an eighth straight month in january but the economy 
still produced 275000 new jobs the government said friday in a 
report that analysts took as a refreshing sign of an economic 
rebound 
this shows the economy is strengthening its about as clear 
an indication as were going to get that the economy is not going 
down said michael k evans head of a private washington 
forecasting firm 
it has to relieve some of the fears that were headed for 
recession added economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill 
since last june monthly unemployment rates as originally 
reported by the labor department have fluctuated within a 
percentage point of 53 percent those monthly figures later were 
revised with updated seasonal adjustment factors and each month 
showed a 53 percent level the agency said 
analysts said the steady jobless rate and betterthanexpected 
job growth was especially encouraging in light of the economys 05 
percent growth at the end of 1989 the poorest showing in more than 
three years 
they said fridays report the first comprehensive look at 
economic activity in 1990 indicates the pace of economic 
expansion as measured by the gross national product should 
improve in the first three months of the year 
in other good economic news the commerce department said friday 
that orders to us factories for manufactured goods shot up 19 
percent in december to a seasonally adjusted 2442 billion 
analysts said the sluggish manufacturing sector of the economy 
might be perking up after durable goods orders jumped 48 percent 
in november and 32 percent in december 
the labor department said januarys strong job growth figures 
might be overstated because the warm weather last month which 
followed a bitter cold december made it tough to seasonally adjust 
job totals for construction and other industries affected by 
weather 
delays in the reporting of postchristmas layoffs in retail 
trade also may have skewed the numbers 
the manufacturing slump added to the overall slowdown in the 
nations economy last year and that sectors lackluster 
performance continued in january 
factory jobs dropped 112000 last month with 90000 of the 
losses suffered by the struggling auto industry however many of 
those laidoff auto workers have been recalled since last month 
when the labor department conducted its survey to gauge job growth 
the agency said 
still it was the 10th straight month manufacturing jobs 
declined yet analysts were impressed at the economys ability to 
absorb those losses without a hike in the jobless rate 
the auto industry has taken a really big hit but the rest of 
the economy is marching along and has virtually swallowed up the 
manufacturing losses said robert dederick chief economist for 
the northern trust co of chicago 
it certainly indicates that the economy is weathering the 
storm it has favorable implications for later on dederick said 
michigan has been particularly hard hit by the manufacturing 
decline the jobless rate there jumped to 84 percent in january 
up from 72 percent in december that was the largest unemployment 
increase in the 11 large industrial states surveyed by the 
government 
construction employers reported a gain of 104000 jobs during 
last months mild weather following the 50000job loss during 
decembers harsh conditions 
meanwhile the serviceproducing industries which helped carry 
the economy last year continued to demonstrate healthy gains this 
year those industries reported 284000 new jobs with 48000 of 
them created in health services 
other industries of the service sector posting large gains were 
transportation with 27000 new jobs wholesale trade 2400 new 
jobs and retail trade 127000 the last figure though is likely 
overstated because of problems factoring in seasonal adjustments 
after christmas 
average hourly earnings sometimes an advance warning of 
inflationary pressures on the economy were up just 01 percent in 
january to 984 
the government said that the civilian labor force or the number 
of people with jobs or those actively seeking employment declined 
by 149000 last month to 124 million the number of americans with 
jobs fell by 25000 to 1178 million 
there were few major shifts in the jobless rate among major 
demographic groups last month the biggest change was among 
hispanics where unemployment fell from 85 percent in december to 
71 percent in january 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the january 
jobless rate was 52 percent down from 53 percent in december

black taxidrivers honked 
horns and stopped traffic and workers whistled to celebrate 
president fw de klerks announcement friday of watershed 
political changes 
blacks surged into in the streets in cape town durban and 
johannesburg at the news that the african national congress and all 
other organizations had been legalized and many national emergency 
restrictions lifted 
they streamed into the dusty roads of townships to cheer and 
marched through a cape town train station chanting anc anc 
while police watched passively 
we are probably seeing history in the making in south 
africa said anglican archbishop desmond tutu who could not stop 
smiling during a news conference 
we had expected that mr de klerk might deliver something but 
what he said has certainly taken my breath away tutu said 
johannesburg whites stepped out of their shops to take 
photographs and smiled as hundreds of blacks danced and marched 
through downtown waving banners and newspaper headlines that 
declared anc unbanned 
drivers stopped their cars in the street honking their horns 
and punching their fists into their air as black workers leaned 
out of office windows whistling and shouting 
police halted the march with a line of yellow patrol vehicles 
chased some protesters and fired tear gas to disperse others no 
injuries or arrests were reported and many protesters laughed as 
they ran from the police 
in cape town thousands of blacks banged placards against the 
fence around parliament chanting anc anc before de klerk 
arrived to deliver his speech which granted many of their demands 
the announcement of the legalization of the anc was picked up on 
a car radio the predominantly black crowd of 5000 broke into 
cheers whistles and more chants as recently freed antiapartheid 
activist popo molefe relayed the news over a bullhorn from the back 
of a truck 
we would be unreasonable if we failed to acknowledge that of 
all the presidents of all the leaders of the nationalist 
government that in fact de klerk has taken the most bold step and 
has emerged as the most courageous molefe said 
mr de klerk in his speech has moved rather swiftly to meet 
most of the demands of the people said the rev allan boesak 
the president of the world alliance of reformed churches these 
are clear decisive steps that will undoubtedly help to create a 
better atmosphere here 
a black youth climbed atop a statue near parliament of jan 
smuts a former south african prime minister waving an anc flag 
and brandishing a wooden model of an ak47 automatic rifle the 
symbol of the ancs military wing 
but police riot squads remained out of view and there were no 
confrontations as the crowd marched joyfully through cape towns 
streets 
scores of white policemen and white shopkeepers watched silently 
from the sidewalks some shaking their heads 
blacks and whites stood in groups with people reading the 
afternoon newspaper whose headline said anc legalized 
after dark thousands of blacks paraded through the townships 
outside cape town waving banners and singing hoarsely while black 
men women and children came to the doors of their tents or 
tinroofed shanties to cheer 
street dancing broke out in downtown durban as a group of black

federal president janez drnovsek 
visited kosovo province friday and appealed for an end to violence 
that has cost the lives of at least 21 ethnic albanians in 10 days 
he said the ethnic unrest threatens political and economic 
reform in yugoslavia which is trying to transform itself from a 
communist nation to a westernstyle democracy with a market economy 
riot police used tear gas to disperse about 200 demonstrators in 
pristina capital of kosovo while drnovsek met with provincial 
officials 
no other protests were reported friday but a virtual general 
strike seemed to be in force kosovo a southern province next to 
albania is the nations poorest region and 90 percent of its 19 
million people are ethnic albanians 
production has almost completely stopped and even some 
people who went to their jobs were refusing to work the official 
news agency tanjug reported 
at least 30000 people in kosovo have been on almost constant 
strike since protests and riots began jan 24 according to 
official statistics 
ethnic albanians have demanded greater autonomy since serbia 
the largest of yugoslavias six republics made constitutional 
changs a year ago that gave it almost total control of the 
province kosovo is part of serbia but had functioned as an 
autonomous region 
tanjug quoted drnovsek as saying i appeal to all peoples in 
kosovo regardless of their nationalities to stop violent 
activities 
he said the situation was exceptionally grave and complex 
and blocks the countrys fundamental reforms 
the federal government has sent a sweeping political and 
economic reform package to parliament 
when drnovsek arrived in pristina he said i have come with 
some new ideas for solving the kosovo problem he would not give 
details and said he would discuss the proposals with provincial 
authorities 
tanjug said a federal government commission consisting of 
premier ante markovic the defense and interior ministers and four 
other cabinet ministers had been formed to monitor and control 
the kosovo situation 
defense minister veljko kadijevic is at his command post with 
a group of generals it said without elaborating 
serbian authorities claim the constitutional changes were 
necessary to protect minority slavs in kosovo the republics 
conservative leaders have denounced proposals from two liberal 
northern provinces slovenia and croatia that kosovo be allowed 
greater freedom 
about 10000 serbs held a rally friday in a pristina sports 
arena to demand that the federal government ensure order 
if it does not the demonstrators said they should be issued 
weapons to defend themselves from attacks by separatists and 
terrorists terms used by serbian officials to describe ethnic 
albanians who seek greater autonomy 
demonstrators carried portraits of slobodan milosevic president 
of serbia and chanted his name speakers claimed slovenia and 
croatia were inciting unrest by claiming the rights of ethnic 
albanians were being violated

force and the armed forces are prepared at all times to defend 
the countrys integrity and its constitutional order brovet 
declared

there is no war in kosovo there are no mad terrorists but only 
powerless demonstrators whose every act is immediately 
misinterpreted in the provinces politicized atmosphere 
it said the demonstrators were victims of a planned policy of 
repression which wants to subjugate them by any means possible 
serbian policy in the province should be allowed to fail 
completely

americans drank less liquor last year 
continuing a decadelong trend and wine consumption dropped for 
the third straight year an industry group reported friday 
changing lifestyles concerns about health and publicity about 
drunken driving and alcohol abuse contributed to the declines 
according to the jobson beverage alcohol group which publishes an 
annual survey 
consumption of distilled spirits dropped more than 2 percent in 
1989 to 141 million cases liquor drinking peaked at 166 million 
cases in 1979 and has dropped 15 percent in 10 years 
wine consumption fell 7 percent in 1989 largely because of the 
decreasing popularity of wine coolers and a drop in table wine 
consumption the organization said 
wine coolers were down 19 percent to about 40 million cases 
while table wine was down 43 percent to 1414 million cases 
sparkling wine was off 54 percent in 1989 and dessert wine was 
off 12 percent but vermouth was up 5 percent possibly reflecting 
an increase in the consumption of martinis jobson reported 
the nations liquor consumption worked out to 08 cases per 
adult down from 11 cases per adult in 1979 per capita 
consumption was at 06 cases the lowest level since 1965 
an average case of liquor contains 12 bottles and holds 27 
gallons 
despite the overall drop tequila was up 12 percent and irish 
whiskey was up 22 percent

punxsutawney phil the countrys no 1 
fourfooted forecaster squinted hard but failed to see his shadow 
friday thus predicting an early spring for only the 10th time in 
more than a century 
the squirming 10pound groundhog was pulled from his manmade 
burrow atop gobblers knob at 727 am the crowd of about 1500 
screamed wildly after phils forecast was announced 
he stood proud tall and confident surveyed the throng of 
loyal followers peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his 
eyes groundward said edwin snyder 64 a county judge and a 
member of the punxsutawney groundhog clubs exclusive inner circle 
he turned to groundhog club president jim means and signaled 
to him in unmistakable groundhogese there is no shadow today 
snyder said 
virtually everyone in the crowd of mostly students some of whom 
had waited in the light rain and mud for hours seemed stunned by 
the woodchucks prediction even the tuxedoclad members of the 
inner circle who decide well in advance what phil predicts every 
groundhog day professed astonishment 
i think he made a good pick said means 66 who held phil 
to his ear then informed snyder of the forecast so the judge could 
announce it 
john groninger 24 a college student from fairbanks alaska 
whos traveling around the country was thrilled with phils 
prediction even though he doubts it will apply back home 
it will be six more weeks of winter no matter what phil 
says groninger said grinning 
tradition has it that if a groundhog sees his shadow at sunrise 
on feb 2 there will be six more weeks of winter if he doesnt 
spring is just around the corner 
phil has predicted an early spring just nine other times since 
1887 when germanborn farmers initiated the yearly event in this 
small western pennsylvania town the favorable forecasts were in 
1890 1902 1934 1950 1970 1975 1983 1986 and 1988 
the farmers borrowed from the legend of candlemas a christian 
feast celebrating the first time the infant jesus was taken to the 
temple an old scottish couplet claims if candlemas be fair 
therell be two winters in the year 
as soon as his forecast was announced phil was whisked away 
from the burrow and returned to his restoftheyear home at the 
local library a heated and airconditioned hutch that he shares 
with two other groundhogs philomena and barney 
other prognosticating groundhogs around the country followed 
phils lead 
octorara orphie also saw no shadow in central pennsylvanias 
quarryville neither did west virginias concord charlie as he was 
wandering around campus to see if any flowers are up said tom 
bone public information director for concord college in athens 
ditto for french creek freddie at the french creek wildlife 
preserve in upshur county in west virginia and general lee at the 
yellow river game ranch in lilburn ga 
buckeye chuck ohios official groundhog also failed to see his 
shadow when he emerged from his burrow in a wooded lot next to the

the newest addition to the groundhog lineup little hog made 
his debut at the indianapolis zoo with fans joining in a rousing 
chorus of you are my sunshine on kazoos but there was no 
sunshine and no shadow there 
phils forecast isnt too far off the national weather services 
prediction for the next few months meteorologists expect february 
to be warmer than usual in western pennsylvania but colder than

president alan garcia said today he will 
attend a drug summit in colombia on feb 15 now that president bush 
has promised to reduce the number of us troops in panama to their 
preinvasion levels 
soon after the united states invaded panama on dec 20 and 
toppled the regime of manuel antonio noriega garcia and other 
latin american leaders protested to washington garcia said at the 
time that he would boycott the summit probably sending a 
government minister in his place 
garcia bush and the presidents of colombia and bolivia had 
planned to coordinate their fight against drug trafficking at the 
meeting in cartagena 
earlier this week president bush said he would reduce the us 
military presence in panama to its preinvasion level of about 
13000 troops well before the end of february he did not give 
a specific date 
at the peak of the us intervention in panama last month 
27000 us troops were there washington already has brought 
11000 home twentythree american servicemen were killed in panama 
and more than 300 wounded the civilian death toll is unclear but 
more than 200 are believed to have died 
before the invasion about 13000 us troops were stationed in 
panama where the us southern command is located a major 
objective of the invasion was to bring noriega to florida to face 
federal drug trafficking charges 
garcia said bushs announcement caused him to reconsider his 
decision to boycott the summit in colombia 
in a statement he said will not only attend the meeting but he 
also will present a decisive and positive proposal to combat 
drug trafficking 
presidents virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia have already agreed to attend the summit which will 
discuss strategies to fight drug trafficking in the united states 
and the three andean nations 
the andean nations are the source of most of the world supply of 
cocaine the bulk of which is sold and consumed in the united 
states

gounods faust once one of the worlds most 
popular operas but nowadays rarely heard has been given a new 
production at the metropolitan opera under the hand of broadway 
veteran harold prince 
at thursday nights premiere the singing was beautiful but 
emotion was lacking 
in fact the most moving parts of the opera were the overture 
conducted by charles dutoit and the final trio for carol vaness as 
marguerite neil shicoff as faust and james morris as 
mephistopheles 
all three were in splendid voice throughout the long evening 
since the entire cast was singing in faust for the first time 
at the met and the scenery and production were new it is 
understandable that digging into character and delivering emotion 
is yet to come 
faust presented on the metropolitan operas opening night 
in 1883 hadnt been heard there since the 197677 season 
the scenery by rolf langenfass who also did costumes was on 
the mets turntable buildings looked as if made by a potter 
creating a suggestion of buildings then greatly enlarged 
marguerites house had a small doorway a window and a few sloping 
tiles indicating a roof depending on what was facing the audience 
the scenery could look like a ruin or beautifully otherworldly 
the devil is often present in faust however in this 
production the church and heaven are always represented the 
backdrop usually looked like stainedglass windows blurred because 
seen from a distance sometimes the shape of a gothic church was 
superimposed on this 
in village square scenes arches indicate the entrance to a 
church when this turned the churchs interior with candles 
banked before an altar was seen 
the decision not to include the walpurgis night ballet was wise 
recent previous attempts have been long and silly 
prince in his met debut has made some directorial decisions so 
that this faust is neither runofthemill nor outrageous 
sometimes mephistopheles comes and goes in a flash of fire his 
first appearance which often occurs that way is more startling in 
this production because the devil simply turns around in the chair 
faust had recently swiveled for his own entrance 
mephistopheles and marthe sung by loretta di franco do too 
much horseplay during fausts courtship of marguerite so that its 
too often interrupted by laughter other small details such as 
marguerites odd movements when faust is early shown a vision of 
her could be praised or debated 
mezzosoprano delores ziegler of decatur ga made her met 
debut her rich voice made a good impression as siebel but and made 
a listener look forward to hearing her in other roles 
brian schexnayder as marguerites brother valentin was showing 
roughness and strain especially on top notes early in the opera 
before the final act it was announced that a sinus infection which 
he had thought cured had returned he finished the opera

the pilot and copilot of a federal 
aviation administration plane that crashed in 1988 killing all 
three crew members were seen drinking the night before the 
accident according to a federal report 
the national transportation safety board report released this 
week in washington also said the copilot previously had lost his 
drivers license for driving under the influence of alcohol 
the board ruled the pilots failure to reduce ice buildup caused 
the twinengine jet to crash in november 1988 11 miles from the 
westmoreland county airport near latrobe 
the ntsb report said the pilot james e burger 64 of linwood 
nj had a bloodalcohol level of 0057 percent and the copilot 
richard m wadsworth 46 of ocean city nj had traces of 
alcohol in his urine also killed was an faa technician 
federal aviation rules bar pilots from flying civil aircraft 
within eight hours after consumption of any alcoholic beverage 
while under the influence of alcohol or while having 004 percent 
bloodalcohol content the legal limit for driving in pennsylvania 
is 010 percent 
the board concluded burgers bloodalcohol content was due 
partly to decomposition and fermenting of body fluids 
dr charles winek director of the pittsburgh laboratory that 
prepared a toxicology report on the bodies for the westmoreland 
county coroners office agreed thursday that body fluids can 
ferment during putrification which can result in the production of 
ethyl alcohol 
however this occurs in a hot humid climate over a matter 
of weeks he told the tribunereview of greensburg this was 
november in wintertime it would take a lot longer than a matter of 
a couple of hours to occur 
the men based at the faa center in pomona nj were on a 
routine inspection flight to test the radar landingguidance system 
at the westmoreland county airport 
the ntsb said the aircrafts icedetection system had been 
operating only intermittently despite forecasts of icing 
conditions in the area the crew decided to complete their testing 
the ntbs said 
evidence indicated crew noticed ice accretion activated 
surface deice system ice broke loose and entered engine intakes 
both engines flames out the report said 
the agency said ice that entered the engine intakes damaged the 
compressor assembly and blades 
both pilots had personal stresses which may have influenced 
performance the report said 
the report said burger had decided to retire that day and 
wadsworth recently had lost his drivers license

abbie hoffman a 1960s activist who gave 
away most of his earnings had more assets when he committed 
suicide last spring than previously believed his attorney says 
his estate is worth more than 37000 according to tax papers 
filed in bucks county courthouse in doylestown instead of the 
2000 reported last fall 
a large portion of that amount came from hoffmans share of a 
property in massachusetts which he never mentioned never 
used gerald lefcourt of new york hoffmans attorney and friend 
for 20 years said friday 
hoffman held 15 percent of the property worth about 100000 
which his father left to him his brother sister and mother 
lefcourt said and thus he could not give it away as he did most of 
his wealth 
he never owned a house never took the proceeds from his books 
and never bought anything for himself lefcourt said 
hoffman gave away hundreds of thousands of dollars to causes he 
supported according to lefcourt who said he watched in the early 
1970s as hoffman signed over to the black panther bail fund the 
movie rights to his book revolution for the hell of it the 
movie never was made 
lefcourt said about 5000 in speaking fees that hoffman never 
collected also turned up in his estate the rest of the money came 
from a motorboat a 1988 hyundai excel a new york checking account 
and a bucks county checking account 
hoffman left his entire estate to johanna lawrenson his 
companion for 15 years 
on april 12 at age 52 he committed suicide in his solebury

skywatchers disappointed by comets 
halley and kahoutek are getting another chance newly discovered 
comet austin the brightest such object to approach earth in 15 
years 
by midapril coment austin should be visible before dawn in 
most parts of the planet university of florida astronomer billy 
cooke said friday 
it wont be spectacular but it will put on a better show than 
halley he said austin looks pretty strong 
he estimated austin will be twice as bright as halley making it 
the brightest since comet west in 1975 there are already 
indications austin could be a little brighter than now projected 
austin appears to be a very dirty and gassy comet which gives 
us cause for optimism because dirty and gassy comets tend to be 
bright cooke said 
although it will be closest to earth at a distance of 30 million 
miles may 19 it will give its best view around april 14 just after 
it swings around the sun 
floridians will get one of the clearest views because it will 
be smack dab over our heads just before sunrise cooke said 
austin will appear to the unaided eye as a dim fuzzy ball the 
tail pointed away from the sun will be visible through binoculars 
or lowpowered telescopes 
now visible only from the southern hemisphere the comet will 
come into view in the northern hemisphere in late march just after 
sunset austin will disappear behind the sun during the first week 
of april and reappear a week later he said 
astronomers from university of florida and other schools will be 
heading to observatories around the world to study austin 
comets are leftover material from the beginning of the 
universe cooke said we can get a view of how the early solar 
system was formed 
the new comet was discovered dec 6 inside jupiters orbit by 
rodney rd austin an amateur astronomer 
like most comets austin probably originated in the oort cloud 
far beyond the outermost planet of pluto cooke said 
for some reason its been flung into our part of the solar 
system the astronomer said itll probably keep coming back 
every hundred thousand years or so now

treasury secretary nicholas f brady on friday 
tried to ease the bush administration away from its recent calls 
for lower interest rates saying such comments were really aimed at 
the slumping homebuilding industry 
brady told congress joint economic committee that a statement 
made two weeks ago by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater urging 
lower interest rates was not meant to pressure the federal reserve 
board 
he said fitzwaters remarks were meant merely as a prelude to a 
visit president bush paid the next day to a homebuilders 
convention in atlanta 
presidents generally talk about lower interest rates at 
housing conferences brady said 
bradys remarks came just four days before fed policymakers were 
scheduled to hold a closeddoor session in washington to set 
monetary targets for the rest of the year 
fed officials are sensitive about appearing to respond to 
prodding from the white house for fear that the financial markets 
will lose confidence in the central banks independence 
talking with reporters on jan 18 fitzwater said a recent prime 
rate reduction by banks had not been passed through to the general 
economy 
its important occasionally to point out that lower interest 
rates are normally good for the economy fitzwater said at the 
time 
the white house spokesman went on to cite commerce department 
statistics showing a drop in housing starts as evidence that lower 
interest rates were needed 
the next day bush told the national association of homebuilders 
that he wanted interest rates to drop further 
the 1990s must be another decade of lower taxes and lower 
interest rates bush said 
the white house usually does not comment publicly on federal 
reserve policy asked by committee chairman lee hamilton dind 
whether fitzwaters comments were inappropriate brady said not 
in light of what i understand was the reason for the statement 
being given 
brady conceded that at his weekly meetings with fed chairman 
alan greenspan the two men have vigorous discussions in which 
they frequently disagree 
the administration probably has a bias toward growth thats 
greater than that of the fed brady said at the same time we 
keep a weather eye on inflation 
the treasury secretary also indicated that although he was not 
satisfied with the current annual inflation rate of 46 percent he 
looked favorably on the lack of dramatic fluctuation in the cost of 
living 
stability is something to be sought after he said

president bush citing tremendous 
problems from overseas competition today announced he is 
creating a panel of science advisers to search for ways to make the 
united states more competitive in science and technology 
bush vowed to engage in tough negotiations to try to knock down 
foreign trade barriers i think we can compete i believe that 
but we cant do it if were up against closed markets and if were 
up against trade restrictions the president said 
speaking at a roundtable discussion on hightech issues at north 
carolina state university the president said weve just got to 
find ways to free up as much as possible our commerce 
i am optimistic about the country i know weve got tremendous 
problems with competition but were getting our focus on it now 
bush said 
were moving into a whole new decade with a whole new focus 
he said 
the business leaders told bush that to keep abreast of foreign 
competition in their industry they wouild like to see more emphasis 
on education particularly math and science at all levels 
bush summoned the newlyformed panel to be headed by white 
house science adviser allan bromley to the presidential retreat at 
camp david md for a kickoff meeting on saturday the panel 
which will have between 10 and 14 members will be called the 
presidents council of advisers on science and technology 
the president traveled to raleigh and to knoxville tenn to 
promote educational goals he outlined in his state of the union 
address earlier this week goals already under attack from critics 
who contend bush doesnt back up his promises with enough money 
look i came here to learn and listen bush said he called 
himself fired up on the subject of improving us 
competitiveness 
bush was focusing today on enhancing research and development 
activities for which he has proposed 71 billion in his fiscalyear 
1991 budget the sum represents an increase of 45 billion over 
the money enacted for 1990 according to white house figures 
at the university of tennessee in knoxville bush called on 
congress to implement his proposals quickly 
building americas competitive strength todaymeans that we 
need quick congressional action on our other proposals for 
investing new capital intellectual capital that includes 
everything from reforming product liability laws to doubling the 
budget of the national science foundation bush said 
some wonder if america has lost its competitive edge and ask 
if we must now look overseas for the answer he said the 
united states is the defending world champion but we have to 
defend our title day by day week by week year in and year out 
bush told reporters flying with him this morning that his goal 
is to make the united states more competitive around the world 
we must not lose our prominence in science and technology 
bush toured the surface science laboratory at north carolina 
state university where students and professors explained their 
work in studying semiconductor surfaces after they showed him an 
elaborate system of equipment and electronic gadgetry bush 
commented all this brain work out here its a little awesome 
laboratory supervisor dr robert nemanich said the program 
receives 250000 in federal funds and that within his field many 
scientists would like to see an increase in support in these 
areas we see in our leadership in technology eroding in 
comparison with foreign competition he told reporters 
the new 15member advisory panel will advise bush on matters 
involving all areas of science and technology 
its members the white house said will be the director of the 
office of science and technology policy and 14 members from the 
private sector 
the presidents action came a day after more than 700 
scientists including 49 winners of the nobel prize accused bush 
of being complacent about the threat of global warming and urging 
him to show greater leadership on the issue 
the scientists representing more than onethird of all members 
of the national academy of sciences said in a letter to bush that 
action must be initiated immediately only by taking action now 
can we ensure that future generations will not be put at risk 
critics on thursday also attacked the presidents education 
budget for being insufficient to achieve his goal of excellence 
in education 
the president came under attack from democrats and education 
groups almost as soon as he announced the goals for improvement in 
students math and science achievement literacy and drugfree 
schools 
there is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of president 
bushs education speeches and the funding levels he offers in his 
budget said albert shanker president of the american federation 
of teachers

branch of the government driving vehicle and licensing center 
said friday 
the belief that 666 represents satan comes from chapter 13 
verse 18 of the new testament book of revelation which refers to 
the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his 
number is six hundred threescore and six 
among those who shun the number is ronald reagan who changed 
his california address from 666 to 668 st cloud drive after 
leaving the white house 
complaints also arose in tennessee in 1988 over the number when 
the state began using new threedigit tags the davidson county 
clerk withdrew all 366 license plates from the county stockpile 
bearing the number 666 when motorists refused to accept the plates 
and said they bore the mark of the devil 
a man from north wales claimed that within one week his house 
was burglarized a garbage truck backed into his car and he was 
told his water supply was poisoned mumford said the man blamed 
his troubles on the 666 in his number plate 
then there was a lady who claimed the car actually took hold 
of her and she couldnt control it it reversed mounted the 
doorstep and squashed her sons scooter she said she stopped it 
only in time to prevent it crashing into the kitchen 
he also cited the case of a mother of a convicted murderer who 
said her son had been a quiet homeloving boy until his job 
required him to drive a van with 666 in the license plate 
a recent television report featured a man who said he lost his 
family home and business after buying a car with 666 in its 
license plate 
the traffic center decided to stop issuing new plates containing 
666 four months ago but is not withdrawing the thousands already 
in circulation mumford said in a telephone interview from the 
centers headquarters in swansea wales 
if you were to convince us that the presence of the number is 
causing you distress we would consider it sympathetically he 
added 
mumford said that because of the practicalities and the 
implications for law enforcement we are very reluctant to change 
number plates on vehicles 
also he said one would assume that if you are so religious 
and superstitious you wouldnt have bought the vehicle in the first 
place 
british license plates have a sequence of three letters three 
digits and an additional letter these signify the year the car was 
produced and the region where it was sold 
some combinations are already excluded including mad god and 
sex

rep gus savage on friday deleted from the 
congressional record personal criticism of three house members 
whose complaint led to his investigation by the chambers ethics 
committee 
on thursday savage took the floor to announce that the 
committee had ended its investigation of him and to call the 
allegations against him a racist attack by the news media and 
government officials 
savage an illinois democrat did not mention in the speech that 
the committee had concluded that his sexual advances to a peace 
corps volunteer during a trip to zaire last march were contrary 
to a house rule requiring members conduct to reflect 
creditably on the chamber 
the report obtained thursday by the ap said the committee 
would have directed savage to apologize to the women had he not 
already done so 
in thursdays speech savage who is black attacked the 
movitations of the three white lawmakers who had complained to the 
ethics panel reps patricia schroeder of colorado matthew mchugh 
of new york and barney frank of massachusetts all are democrats 
savage noted in the speech that the three lawmakers had filed 
their complaint despite admitting that they knew absolutely 
nothing about the case other than allegations in a washington post 
newspaper story last year that detailed the womans account of 
the incident 
a tape of his speech shows that savage then said in remarks 
deleted from the record 
and believe it or not among these selfappointed guardians of 
personal morality was one who since has admitted keeping and 
prostituting a homosexual as for the other two socalled liberals 
i urge them to review their sensitivity to racism and respect for 
fairness 
the ethics committee is investigating frank who has 
acknowledged paying a male prostitute for sex but has denied other 
allegations of improper conduct made by the prostitute 
savages spokesman donnovan dunkley was not immediately 
available for comment none of the three representatives savage 
criticized would comment after his speech 
only a member can revise his remarks in the official record a 
house staff source speaking only on the condition of anonymity 
said a member of the house floor staff suggested that he 
savage remove those remarks from the record and he agreed to 
that 
the proceedings of a house or senate session are printed the 
next day in the congressional record which is the official 
transcript of proceedings but is not always an accurate reflection 
of what was said on the floor the discrepancy occurs whenever a 
member exercises his right to revise and extend his remarks in 
the printed record

the us ambassador to nato said friday 
the east german premiers proposal that a reunited germany be 
neutral was both premature and unrealistic 
the right thing to do is to wait until east germany has had 
elections and has a democratically elected government in place and 
take up the subject at that time william h taft iv said in an 
interview in his office at alliance headquarters 
he said premier hans modrows proposal is certainly a novel 
one coming from a leader of what is still a nondemocratically 
elected government 
taft a former deputy defense secretary said a unified germany 
within nato is a much better idea in terms of contributing to the 
stability and security of europe and of germany for that matter 
east germany belongs to the sovietled warsaw pact 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany has 
suggested a reunified germany remain part of the north atlantic 
treaty organization but with only the territory of west germany be 
tied to its military structure 
taft said genschers proposal answers the basic requirement 
for stability in europe which is that west germany should be 
aligned with the west 
the genscher plan recognizes that west germanys links to nato 
and the european community have been crucial for germanys 
security and prosperity over the years and it would continue 
that he said 
it would be a very big mistake for germany to leave the 
western military alliance taft said and i dont understand that 
this is at all contemplated by the government in bonn 
germanys security germanys prosperity germanys freedom 
have been won and protected and grown within nato and the 
ec the us ambassador said i really dont sense any desire 
to give that up 
taft said he believed president bushs proposal for further deep 
cuts in soviet and american troops strengths in europe would help 
advance the negotiations on conventional arms being conducted in 
vienna 
in his state of the union message wednesday night bush 
suggested a ceiling of 195000 soldiers each for the united states 
and soviet union in central europe the united states would have 
30000 more in britain and southern europe 
last may bush proposed an overall limit of 275000 each the 
soviet union has an estimated 565000 troops stationed in europe 
outside its national territory and the united states has 305000 
in western europe 
taft said political changes in eastern europe suggested that 
the levels we had arrived at in may could be reduced and that 
proposal was becoming one that needed some change at the vienna 
talks 
czechoslovakia and hungary have asked the kremlin for quick 
withdrawal of the estimated 120000 red army soldiers still on 
their soil 
we anticipate that the difficulties that the soviets have had 
in finding the welcome mat for their troops in eastern europe will 
certainly result in substantial reductions taft said it may 
well result in reductions below 195000 
he said the american plan would be submitted to a special nato 
panel monday for approval then be proposed soon in vienna 
bargainers for the 16 nato nations and the seven in the warsaw 
pact hope for agreement this year on reducing the number of battle 
tanks artillery armored troop carriers combat aircraft 
helicopters and soldiers in europe

the longlost text of a sermon delivered 271 
years ago by puritan leader cotton mather has been rediscovered 
offering a more complex portrait of the man best known for his role 
in the salem witch trials 
because of mathers standing as one of the most learned and 
most influential of the puritan people a find of this nature is 
very significant said richard fyffe who identified the 
document he is chief librarian of the essex institute which 
collects preserves and studies the history of essex county 
although historians and bibliographers knew mather gave a 
stirring funeral sermon from newspaper accounts letters and other 
sources they had searched in vain for decades for a full text of 
mathers remarks 
mather read the sermon on nov 9 1718 at the funeral of george 
worthylake his wife ann and their daughter ruth 
worthylake keeper of bostons first lighthouse on little 
brewster island was drowned with his wife and daughter when their 
boat capsized in a fierce storm worthylakes two other children 
witnessed the accident from the shore 
tho they were now so very near the shoar yet the winds and 
the seas were so high they could not fetch it before they were 
all of them unhappily drowned mather wrote there were two or 
three children with a kinswoman who with inexpressible horror and 
anguish beheld the deadly distress of their parents and sister 
and others thus perishing in the waters unable to give the least 
help unto them 
imagine if thou canst the agony he urged in the sermon 
the dead bodies of their parents and sister and others being 
thrown upon the land were the only company which these poor 
children had upon the desolate island for two whole days and 
nights together 
mathers eulogy pointed to the puritan ethic that tragedies are 
a part of gods will but fyffe noted that mathers sympathy for 
the children and the horror expressed at the accident were 
characteristics not normally associated with puritan expression 
it is not surprising that we have caricatured the puritans as 
a hard unemotional people but they were not as unfeeling and 
unsympathetic as we seem to believe they were said fyffe 
mathers sermon is an example of this 
fyffe found the sermon providence asserted and adored last 
year as he was cataloguing the essex institutes collection for a 
nationwide computer database of all early american printed material 
made before 1801 
in the course of the work fyffe came across the pamphlet which 
had never been properly identified because it was missing a cover 
a former librarian had placed a note with the document suggesting 
it might be written by mather but apparently never followed up on 
it fyffe did 
the pamphlet is now at the institute in salem a seaside city 
about 20 miles north of downtown boston 
mather who lived from 1663 to 1728 was considered a leading 
theological and scientific expert of his time he published nearly 
400 documents ranging from fiery sermons to scientific 
examinations 
however he is probably best known for his role in support of 
the salem witch trials of 1692 during which 20 people were 
executed 
fyffe said the finding is important because mather has long been 
considered both an intellectual and spiritual genius and the 
pamphlet could change an image tainted by the witch trials 
if this contributes to the publics developing a more complex 
sense of who cotton mather was then it is important fyffe said 
cotton was not the ideal man in any means but he was a more 
sympathetic man than we tend to give him credit for being

sidney barthelemy new orleans second black 
mayor is expected to add another election to his unbroken string 
saturday against a white challenger who has accused him of 
racebaiting 
i do expect the voting returns to fall along racial lines 
said silas lee barthelemys pollster 
about 544 percent of new orleans 237342 registered voters are 
black and 444 percent white with asians making up the rest 
barthelemy 47 and donald mintz 46 a lawyer who formerly 
headed the citys dock board spent friday shaking hands and making 
personal appearances 
early polls put mintz ahead of barthelemy but in recent polls 
barthelemy who was a state senator and city councilman before 
becoming mayor and has never lost an election has drawn ahead by 
10 to 12 percentage points 
the fourmonth campaign created little interest upstaged by 
parties for the yearend holidays the sugar bowl and the super 
bowl even the issue of race which sparked the candidates two 
televised debates did little to enliven the campaign 
mintz who wears a lapel button showing white and black hands 
interlinked claimed barthelemys ads on a black radio station 
appealed to antiwhite racism 
barthelemy said it was mintz who interjected the issue of race 
mintz didnt want sidney to highlight what he did for black 
business and the black community on black radio lee said no 
other candidate has said that was racebaiting 
and in the past other candidates havent said by 
highlighting what youve done for one group or constituency that 
is race baiting or sex baiting or any other type of baiting 
another racial issue arose when anonymous fliers depicted 
barthelemy as an opportunistic uncle tom 
barthelemy accused mintz of distributing the fliers but mintz 
vehemently denied it 
the campaigns other issues have been high crime low 
employment and the candidates political experience and competence 
but until his death on dec 23 most of the interest was focused 
on former mayor ernest dutch morial the citys first black mayor 
the whole campaign for the past year literally was dominated 
by dutch morial said ed renwick director of loyola universitys 
institute of politics and pollster for mintz 
until morial announced dec 14 that he wouldnt run the basic 
question was would he run or wouldnt he run said renwick and 
from then until his death it was why didnt he run and would he 
endorse mintz 
i would say you still have a lot of voters showing little or 
no interest said lee usually you have a passionate 
electorate when you have a candidate who is disliked by a 
substantial number of voters you dont have that here people get 
passionate when theres somebody they want out of office 
but registrar louis keller said 55 to 60 percent of the voters 
are expected to turn out for the election which also includes 
races for five city council seats and nine other city offices 
herman j buster bustamente and black businessman rudy e 
mills sr are also in the race for mayor but expected to draw few 
votes 
if no candidate gets more than half the vote a runoff will be 
held march 3

richard wilson who was chairman of the 
oglala sioux tribe during the 1973 american indian movement 
occupation of wounded knee has died he was 55 
wilson who had been hospitalized in rapid city died thursday 
of complications from an enlarged heart and kidney failure 
according to his brother jim wilson 
he was the only oglala sioux tribal chairman to serve two 
consecutive terms holding office from 1972 to 1976 
it was ironic that wilson died the same day gov george 
mickelson and tribal leaders from across the state signed a 
document naming 1990 a year of reconciliation between indians and 
whites longtime friend tim giago of rapid city said friday 
thats something wilson strived for all his life said giago 
publisher of the lakota times an indian newspaper 
wilson who disagreed publicly with the militant tactics of aim 
was labeled a goon by the aim activists who occupied wounded 
knee controversy erupted because it was wilsons sworn duty to 
uphold reservation laws and the laws were being broken giago 
said 
wilson was treated unfairly because the national media told the 
wounded knee story from aims viewpoint he said 
they aim had the ear and the eye of the press of the 
national media that flocked out here unfortunately dick was never 
very good at working and dealing with the press according to 
giago 
after aim left and after all their leaders went off to 
other places in the world dick wilson stayed on that reservation 
and helped clean up the mess that was left there 
wilson urged indians to get involved in tribal and state 
government he helped set up the first indian housing authority on 
the pine ridge indian reservation 
giago said he went to the hospital thursday and talked to wilson 
before he died 
he told me that he just couldnt continue anymore that his 
heart was broken giago said 
his eldest son billy b wilson 35 was killed a week ago in a 
vehiclepedestrian accident in dallas and i guess the stress of 
that just broke him up completely giago said 
wilson a contractor and plumber served as a tribal council 
member for six years before being elected chairman of the tribe he 
lived on a ranch north of pine ridge 
he had been attempting a political comeback and was a candidate 
for tribal chairman again in the primary feb 13 
in addition to his brother wilson is survived by his wife 
mary and several children

bakkers top deputy at the ptl ministry arrived friday at the 
federal prison camp on this base to begin serving an eightyear 
sentence for fraud and conspiracy 
dortch 58 pleaded guilty in august days before he and bakker 
were to go on trial in charlotte nc 
under a plea bargain dortch testified against bakker at his 
former boss trial he also appeared in december before a grand 
jury that later indicted the rev sam johnson a former ptl 
executive for perjury 
bakker is serving a 45year sentence in a federal prison in 
minnesota 
dortch will be eligible for parole after serving about 2 years 
he also was fined 200000 us district judge robert potter has 
yet to hear a motion from dortchs lawyers for a reduction in his 
sentence 
dortch will be in an admission and orientation program for about 
two weeks before he is assigned a job at the camp or elsewhere on 
the base about 40 miles east of pensacola said warden willie scott 
dortch is the lastest on a long list of celeberity inmates who 
have served time at the unfenced minimumsecurity camp 
others have included watergate figure e howard hunt fashion 
magnates aldo gucci and albert nipon and former baseball pitcher 
lamarr hoyt politicians and judges also have been eglin inmates 
including former us rep richard kelly rfla who was convicted 
in the abscam scandal and former maryland gov marvin mandel 
most of the 800 or so inmates on the 28acre compound are 
whitecollar criminals and lowlevel drug dealers 
the camp has been derided by critics as a country club 
prison and nicknamed club fed 
two air force sergeants recently pleaded guilty to accepting or 
agreeing to accept bribes to take an inmate to nearby motel for a 
rendezvous with his wife 
prison officials dispute the country club image 
these are nonviolent people from a variety of backgrounds 
not all of them are big shots by any means scott told the 
associated press last year most of them are serving short 
sentences and since they arent dangerous and we are located on a 
military base we dont even need to have a fence around the 
place 
in addition to housekeeping jobs at the camp prisoners work 
throughout the base primarily doing landscaping scott said 
eglin is the nations largest air base covering 720 square

allegations that former cia operative thomas g clines failed to 
report income on his tax returns from arms transactions involving 
the contras according to sources familiar with the probe 
a key witness in the investigation of clines according to the 
sources is albert hakim who was placed on two years probation 
and fined 5000 thursday for his role in the irancontra affair 
hakim and business partner richard secord set up the 
enterprise the network of offshore companies used to handle 
money in the secret supply operation to the contras and the reagan 
administrations sales of arms to iran 
at the request of his friend secord clines helped procure arms 
for the contra rebels starting in 1985 in addition to locating a 
european arms dealer as a source of weapons clines helped arrange 
for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the 
rebels some 972728 in commissions were set aside for clines in 
the account of an entity codenamed c tea according to the 
congressional irancontra report issued in november 1987 
in testimony to congress in 1987 given under immunity from 
prosecution based on his words hakim identified c tea as the 
code name for clines hakim didnt begin supplying irancontra 
prosecutors with information on the matter until he entered a plea 
agreement with the government nov 21 
in court papers the government said hakim has indicated his 
willingness to give testimony in an anticipated future case 
and is cooperating in a grand jury investigation outside 
washington the papers did not elaborate but the sources 
commenting only on condition they not be named said the subject of 
the investigation is clines 
a longtime attorney for clines john ellsworth stein declined

the sources added 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for the irancontra prosecutors 
office declined to comment 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh which began 
operating in december 1986 focused on clines early in its 
investigation but was unable to assemble a case the sources said

the united states on friday urged the angolan 
government to stop its offensive against the usarmed unita 
rebels and said it had sought soviet cooperation to end the 
fighting 
gains by sovietarmed government forces have brought them to the 
edge of unitacontrolled territory in southeastern angola 
a military source in lisbon said friday the angolan army had 
captured the strategic unita airstrip of mavinga after a fierce 
battle that included air strikes but a unita spokesman in lisbon 
denied it 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said she could 
not confirm the fall of mavinga to the government but that a large 
force of troops had crossed the lombo river and were within 10 
miles of mavinga that information was based on independent 
confirmation officials said 
mavinga is considered a key to military control of the region 
and vital to any government plans to attack the rebel stronghold at 
jamba 120 miles farther south 
the offensive by the sovietbacked government began in late 
december apparently in an attempt to capture more territory as a 
bargaining chip in peace talks with unita the union for the total 
independence of angola 
efforts by the united states the soviet union and portugal to 
revive the peace talks that began last june have stalled 
the offensive will make it increasingly difficult to reach the 
negotiated settlement necessary to conclude this tragic conflict 
tutwiler said we urge luanda to halt its military offensive and 
to devote its efforts to finding a negotiated solution 
the united states stands willing to assist the parties and the 
mediator in the search for peace she said 
assistant secretary of state herman cohen discussed this at 
meetngs in the angolan capital of luanda 10 days ago 
the united states has spoken to soviet officials about the 
latest offensive several times mrs tutwiler said the soviets 
have restated their commitment to a negotiated settlement of the 
angolan conflict and their belief that there are no military 
solutions 
but soviet military aid to angolas government continues at 
high levels and soviet military advisers remain in angola she 
said the united states gives unita headed by jonas savimbi at 
least 40 million in weapons every year it has vowed to continue 
arming the group until peace is achieved 
however soviet military advisers have pulled back from the 
forward fighting area in southeastern angola since midjanuary 
mrs tutwiler added there also were no signs of cubans involved in 
the offensive 
cuban troops estimated to number 50000 at the peak of their 
presence in angola have been ahead of a scheduled 1991 pullout 
agreed to last year as part of a complex peace package that also 
brought independence to the former south african colony of namibia

thousands of illegal aliens who are children 
or spouses of legal immigrants will be allowed to stay in this 
country under a policy announced friday by immigration commissioner 
gene mcnary 
under mcnarys order those aliens will be given permission to 
stay if they were in this country on nov 1 1986 the day the 
immigration reform and control act took effect 
officials estimated that more than 100000 people might be 
affected by the new policy 
the policy previously enforced by the immigration and 
naturalization service allowed family members who are illegal 
aliens to stay only if there was a compelling humanitarian 
reason against deportation 
mcnary said that standard was too nebulous and resulted in a 
policy that has not been evenly and uniformly enforced throughout 
the country 
some ins district directors were too strict and others too 
lenient in applying the standard he told reporters only a handful 
of people were deported under the old policy he said 
but mcnary said a more consistent policy may encourage more 
people to apply for the new status which would allow them to 
obtain work permits 
while the ins will strictly enforce immigration laws to deter 
illegal border crossingswe can enforce the law humanely 
mcnary said 
to split families simply encourages further violation of the 
law as they illegal aliens attempt to reunite mcnary said 
the law granted blanket amnesty to illegal aliens who could 
prove they were residing in the country before jan 1 1982 it 
also provided immigrant status to undocumented farm workers who 
could prove they had worked 90 days picking crops in this country 
in any one of three years 
more than 3 million illegal aliens have been given legal status 
under the amnesty program in the 1986 law of those more than 1 
million have applied for permanent residency 
the spouses and children covered by the order typically followed 
their relatives to this country but did not arrive in time to 
qualify for amnesty these people technically remain illegal aliens 
the decision was lauded by representatives of immigrantrights 
groups but was also termed belated because it was made long after 
the legalization program ended illegal aliens had until may 1988 
to apply for permanent residency status under the amnesty program 
its just a shame that it has taken such a long time to 
ameliorate some of the harsh and restrictive elements that had been 
used in the legalization program said arthur c helton head of 
the asylum project of the lawyers committee for human rights 
many eligible aliens didnt apply for permanent residency 
because they feared relatives who entered illegally would be caught 
and deported helton said 
arnoldo torres national political director of the league of 
united latin american citizens who has been harshly critical of the 
agency called the order probably one of the most reasonable 
positions that ins has taken 
the cases of those given permission to stay will be reviewed 
annually to determine if the aliens had committed crimes or had 
become dependent on welfare assistance aliens could be deported if 
they committed crimes or if the ins found they had become public 
charges mcnary said 
the new policy was criticized by the federation for american 
immigration reform as just plain illegal

state rep jesse white has spent more than 30 
years helping innercity youths who live in some of the toughest 
neighborhoods somersault their way past gangs and into a better way 
of life 
since its creation in 1959 the jesse white tumbling team has 
been featured at professional sports games in a book and a movie 
white 55 said he designed the team to combat juvenile 
delinquency a frequent hazard for his tumblers most of whom live 
in the crimeridden cabrinigreen housing project 
my kids know that as long as theyre part of the tumbling 
team theyre safe in the community white said thursday of his 
75 varsity tumblers who range in age from 6 to 26 
were looked upon as baseball heroes or movie stars 
said white a legislator for 14 years 
eighteenyearold james hogg a team member for the last eight 
years said joining the squad kept him out of trouble 
the team taught me not to settle for less in life said hogg 
the tumblers perform a dizzying array of stunts members flip 
over obstacles do double twists and double backward flips for the 
finale members bounce off a minitrampoline over as many as 25 
other teammates 
the team which depends largely on corporate sponsors for 
financial support has visited japan and performed at professional 
sporting events in chicago and across the country this year they 
plan to visit china and korea 
the tumblers were featured in the movie ferris buellers day 
off and a book i am a jesse white tumbler which tells the 
story of a boy who joined the team when he was 5 
white said tumblers are prohibited from joining gangs 
its simple said white if youre with them we dont 
need you i have a waiting list of 3600 kids for this program if 
you want to be part of the gangbangers go 
white said tumblers have often told him that theyd rather be in 
trouble with the police than with him he described an incident 
four years ago with a tumbler who for the third and final time 
had violated team rules 
he slapped another member of the team and i said that i 
have to dismiss you he said please mr white dont take this 
away from me this is all that i have you can take off my arms 
take off my legs pluck out my eyes but please dont put me off 
the team said white 
in addition to the 75 varsity tumblers there are 10 girls in 
his dance troupe and 550 wouldbe varsity members are tutored each 
week 
white said his schedule is busy but that he doesnt mind 
because he remembers what people did for him as a youngster 
often when we reach great heights in life we forget who 
brought us there well i have not he said

the bush administration is seeking more than 
18 billion in fiscal 1991 defense spending for major weapons 
targeting warsaw pact forces despite the political upheaval in 
eastern europe a congressional agency reported friday 
congress bipartisan arms control and foreign policy caucus said 
president bushs new budget calls for an increase of more than 1 
billion from the fiscal 1990 budget for the weapons 
the chairman of the caucus rep howard l berman dcalif 
said that while he applauded bushs call for reduced troop levels 
in europe the budget for weapons should reflect the new era too 
we shouldnt pour billions into new weapons systems designed to 
counter warsaw pact forces that no longer exist 
in his state of the union address bush proposed a reduction of 
us and soviet combat troops in europe to 225000 on each side in 
response to the tumultuous changes in the eastern bloc where 
democracies have emerged from the rubble of communist regimes 
defense secretary dick cheney in testimony before the senate 
armed services committee on thursday said the soviet union is 
likely to withdraw all it troops from eastern europe by the middle 
of the decade 
the caucus lists 25 major nuclear and conventional weapons 
systems which in the past the pentagon has justified as primarily 
for use in europe according to the report if the administration 
continues these programs the cost will total about 70 billion 
over a threeyear period beginning in fiscal 1992 bush is seeking 
2921 billion in defense spending in fiscal 1991 
among the budget requests are an increase of 64 million for the 
sramt or tactical shortrange attack missile a jump of 80 
million in spending for the shortrange missile or followon to 
the lance and 235 million more for the tomahawk landattach 
nuclear cruise missile 
the proposed spending plan also includes slightly more than 1 
billion for the advanced tactical fighter 27 billion for the 
c17 transport aircraft and 3 billion for the f16 fighter plane 
our weapons policy should match our threat assessment 
berman said in releasing the caucus report obviously not every 
weapon on this list should be canceled but given the last six 
months both congress and the executive branch have a duty to 
reevaluate the assumptions behind these weapons before we write 
the check for them 
the caucus is composed of 140 members of congress the 
organizations staff and the congressional research service of the 
library of congress compiled the list of weapons

democratic party chairman ronald h brown said 
friday that while he sees hopeful signs of progress in south 
africa it is too early to consider lifting us economic sanctions 
i think we ought to keep the pressure on south africa as long 
as it takes said brown 
the democratic party leader commented shortly after president 
bush said he would review us sanctions in the light of the 
announcement by south african president fw de klerk that he was 
legalizing the opposition african national congress and would soon 
free its imprisoned leader nelson mandela 
i think when people move in the right direction it is 
certainly time to review all policy bush said 
lets see what happens brown said when asked about the 
possibility of lifting us sanctions against the apartheid 
government lets see what happens with mandela 
there are certainly some hopeful signs and we all ought to be 
pleased with those signs i dont know that we ought to be 
recommending any abrupt changes 
the us sanctions include a ban on importing south african 
steel textiles uranium coal and agricultural produce they also 
bar new us investment in south africa forbid new bank loans and 
end us landing rights for south african airways 
brown also said that when he was in israel last week prime 
minister yitzhak shamir assured him that israel would disclose 
within the next several weeks a timetable for terminating its 
military contracts with south africa

the communist party purged its ranks of 
the old guard friday and handed leadership to a moderate reformer 
who promised to pursue democratic reforms 
alexander lilov a veteran communist who fell from favor in the 
old stalinist regime said he would overhaul the party before it 
competes in bulgarias free elections set for may 
lilov replaces petar mladenov who will remain as state 
president bowing to demands of reformers mladenov had proposed 
separating the posts of communist party chief and head of state 
the changes in the party were the latest since mladenov replaced 
todor zhivkov the hardline communist leader whose 35year rule 
was ended on nov 10 
lilov said it is not possible for the party to avoid reform 
because the situation in the country and the party has changed 
lilov was elected during a 24hour secret session that closed a 
fourday emergency party congress 
the central committee was replaced by a 153member supreme 
council that is less than half the size of its predecessor but 
contains a much broader political spectrum including radical 
proreform factions 
ninety percent of the central committee members failed to win 
election to the council that replaces it party sources said 
the delegates also created a 51member commission on party 
ethics and a 31member central finance commission 
zhivkov 78 has been arrested on charges of abuse of office and 
inciting ethnic hostility during his rule bulgarian state radio 
reported friday that zhivkovs health was so bad he could not 
remain in prison and was moved to a hospital 
the radio did not describe zhivkovs illness nor say when he was 
hospitalized 
among those not on the new supreme council is premier georgi 
atanassov who resigned thursday with his 22member cabinet after 
coming under sharp criticism during the congress for failing to 
solve bulgarias economic woes 
the resignation was necessary to form a cabinet on a broad 
national basis said the state news agency bta 
the communists have made a vague proposal for a government of 
national concord to rule until the may elections lilov 
announced that talks on the new government would begin saturday 
with opposition groups 
but lyubomir pavlov a senior official from the opposition union 
of democratic forces said the opposition is unlikely to take part 
in a provisional government 
he said the opposition would have little clout since communists 
control 67 percent of parliament 
compared with their east bloc neighbors bulgarian communists 
have given up relatively little power bolstered by a century of 
roots in the nations politics and a relatively weak though 
growing opposition 
but after his unanimous election by the supreme council lilov 
56 told the delegates the party is at a critical juncture 
we really had to try to elect a leadership which will work 
not only in difficult conditions but will lead the party to victory 
in elections he said 
a philologist by training who was the politburo ideologist 
through the 1970s but absent from the leadership from 1983 to 1989 
lilov told the congress wednesday we are lagging behind 
he acknowledged the party suffers from a a lack of 
confidence and said while the party and the country are in a 
crisis we have not reached the climax yet 
the supreme council also elected mladenov lilov and two other 
top party figures andrei lukanov and popular defense minister 
dobri dzhurov to a presidium that will essentially replace the 
politburo under the new party structure 
by far the most urgent task of the new leadership will be 
restructuring the economy which many congress delegates said is in 
disarray 
the economic problems felled atanassov a holdover from the 
zhivkov era who had come under fire for failing to curb 
unprecedented labor unrest and making concessions to striking 
miners 
a bulgarian official said french experts had been called in to 
work out a program of unspecified economic reforms

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
slowed to a 64 percent increase in 1989 the government said 
friday but analysts said manufacturing should revive slowly this 
year 
if you take the figures at face value except for some 
industries like autos the worst is over said gordon richards 
director of economic policy at the national association of 
manufacturers 
john hagens an economist with the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa had a similar assessment saying that while much of the 
economy continues to grow slowly its not on the verge of a 
recession 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods gained 19 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 2442 billion in december after rising 24 percent in 
november 
the increase put orders for the year at 283 trillion after a 
97 percent increase in 1988 which was the largest advance since 
1983 orders had declined 1 percent in 1986 
durable goods orders held back during much of the year by the 
federal reserves highinterest policies slowed to a 59 percent 
gain in 1989 following advances of 11 percent in 1988 and 76 
percent in 1987 
but in the key category of nondefense capital goods a 
barometer of business investment plans orders rose 18 percent in 
december to 459 billion after an 81 percent hike in november 
evelina tainer senior domestic economist at first national bank 
of chicago said nondefense capital goods orders fell about 16 
percent during the third quarter pointing to the weakness in the 
manufacturing sector 
but they rose 7 percent at an annual rate in the 
octoberdecember period which she said shows the manufacturing 
sector was bottoming out in the fourth quarter and theres a little 
revival there 
michael k evans head of evans economics inc a washington 
forecasting firm noted that in another report friday the labor 
department said 116000 factory jobs were lost in january 90000 
of them in the automobile industry but evans added many of the 
autoworkers have returned to work 
its the end of the manufacturing slump he said 
for december durable goods orders were up 32 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 1344 billion after rising 48 percent in 
november most of the increase was in transportation which 
increased 112 percent to 409 billion excluding transportation 
orders would have risen only 02 percent 
electrical machinery increased 5 percent to 227 billion 
offsetting a 47 percent decline in nonelectrical machinery to 
216 billion primary metals orders were down 38 percent to 108 
billion 
nondurable goods orders increased 03 percent in december to 
1099 billion with most of the increase in petroleum products 
nondurable orders had fallen 02 percent in november after a 06 
percent gain in october 
the oftenvolatile defense orders were down 116 percent to 
996 billion after rising 177 percent a month earlier excluding 
defense orders would have advanced 25 percent 
the commerce department also said shipments of manufactured 
goods fell 05 percent in december to 2318 billion while 
inventories dropped 04 percent to 3715 billion it was the first 
decline in inventories since last september and the largest since 
they dropped 04 percent in september 1986 
if inventories increase without a corresonding gain in new 
orders it could signal production cutbacks as factories attempt to 
get rid of goods on shelves and in back lots

president alan garcia said friday he will 
attend the feb 15 drug summit with president bush in colombia 
reversing his earlier decision to boycott the meeting if us 
troops were still in panama 
garcia said he decided to go to the meeting after bush announced 
his intention to withdraw by the end of the month troops sent to 
panama to remove gen antonio manuel noriega from power 
presidents virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia are also set to attend the summit which is to take place 
in cartagena colombia 
they are to discuss strategies to fight drug trafficking in 
their respective countries the three andean nations are the source 
of most of the world supply of cocaine most of which is sold in 
the united states 
garcia cited the gravity of the drug problem and said he 
will go with a decisive and positive proposal to combat 
trafficking 
bolivia and peru produce 90 percent of the worlds coca leaf 
most of perus coca harvest is transformed into paste and shipped 
to colombia where it is refined into cocaine 
bolivian traffickers formerly did the the same but increasingly 
are producing refined cocaine and smuggling it directly to the 
united states and europe according to us drug officials 
the drug trade brings billions of dollars in clandestine 
revenues into the three countries each year 
bush last year proposed spending 22 billion over the next five 
years to fight the drug trade in the three andean nations 
among the topics the four presidents are expected to discuss are 
military and police aid to fight smugglers and leftist guerrillas 
tied to drug trafficking crop eradication and substitution 
programs cooperation in stopping the laundering of drug money and 
the extradition of drug suspects 
garcia had pulled out of the meeting after us troops landed in 
panama dec 20 to topple noriega saying i cannot meet with the 
leader of an invading nation peru had planned to send a 
highlevel delegation to the summit even if garcia did not go 
on jan 7 garcia said he would attend the summit if us troops 
were first withdrawn in announcing his decision to go garcia said 
friday he trusted bushs promise to withdraw the troops by the end 
of february 
this removes one of the obstacles in the way of my 
attendance garcia told reporters at the government palace 
i have no reason to doubt the announcement he made before 
congress 
bush said wednesday in his state of the union address that all 
additional troops sent to panama would be withdrawn by the end 
of the month 
about 27000 us troops were in panama during the invasion 
about 13000 troops had been stationed at us bases there before 
the invasion and the same number are to remain after the february 
pullout 
garcia has been highly critical of the us actions in panama 
and charged the united states intended to break the panama canal 
treaties of 1977 which call for the united states to cede control 
of the panama canal at the end of the century 
garcia also recalled his ambassador in washington and suspended 
for one week joint antidrug operations with us drug agents and 
peruvian police in protest

gen michel aoun sent tanks against his 
rivals seaside command post friday the fourth day of a battle for 
christian supremacy that has killed more than 120 people and 
wounded 500 most of them civilians 
police said a halfmillion people were trapped in basements and 
bomb shelters of christian east beirut without electricity food or 
water after a ceasefire thursday afternoon failed to hold each 
side accused the other of breaking it 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir the maronite catholic spiritual 
leader appealed to aoun and his adversary samir geagea both 
maronites stop shooting have mercy on the people their 
lives and property are not yours you must stop this massacre now 
you must stop this mass suicide 
a statement from the international committee of the red cross 
said it was alarmed by the intensity of the clashes and 
requested a humanitarian ceasefire quickly to permit the 
evacuation of casualties 
geagea said his lebanese forces militiamen crushed the 
repeated advance attempts by two columns of aouns tanks trying 
to converge on his command post behind howitzer fire of 20 shells a 
minute 
geageas television station later said his militiamen overran 
the amsheet base of aouns 7th brigade on the northern edge of the 
enclave it broadcast a film showing 7th brigade commander brig 
gen sami rehana surrendering to the lebanese forces at the base 
in east beirut shells hit highrise apartment buildings fuel 
depots hospitals and filling stations sparking fires that raged 
out of control police said snipers kept fire engines from battling 
the blazes 
one salvo at 10 pm set the citys main power plant on fire 
mohieddin mmehio acting head of the staterun electricity 
authority pleaded in an appeal broadcast by all beirut radio 
stations for a 6hour neutralization of the sad elboushrieh 
industrial area to allow firefighters to put down the blaze 
otherwise beirut will be without power for months to come 
he warned 
the capital has already been without power since the fighting 
erupted tuesday that was attributed to the inability of 
electricity authority employees to report to work at the main 
generating plant in the embattled zouk suburb because of the 
hostilities 
tongues of orangered flames pierced the dark sky and clouds of 
black smoke hung over the city as shelling duels raged into the 
night 
patriarch sfeir appealed to the combatants after presiding over 
a meeting of senior maronite clerics at his hilltop seat in bkirki 
north of beirut 
four howitzer shells landed in the area while they met geageas 
radio and television stations blamed the shelling on aoun 
voice of the nation a moslem radio said aouns men fired 
shells that fell in west beirut the moslem sector has not been 
involved in the war between the rebel general and geagea who 
commands lebanons main christian militia 
police said seven people were killed and 40 wounded in west 
beirut and president elias hrawi who lives and works there was 
forced to move to a secret hideout 
they said at least five 120mm mortar rounds landed near hrawis 
residence in the ramlet albaida district an aide reached by 
telephone said the president changed his office for his own 
safety 
voice of lebanon radio a christian station owned by allies of 
geagea proclaimed beirut is burning 
geageas lebanese forces issued a statement saying aoun has 
shown himself unscrupulous in satisfying his lust for power even 
if it means apocalypse for everyone 
hrawi dismissed aoun as army commander but he has refused to 
step aside or turn over the presidential palace in suburban baabda 
where a bunker serves as his headquarters he commands about 20000 
men and geagea has about 6000 bolstered by several thousand 
reservists 
it was difficult to determine friday who was getting the upper 
hand aoun appeared determined to destroy the lebanese forces but 
repeated assaults have failed to reach geageas main arms and 
ammunition depot in the ashrafiyeh district of east beirut 
control in the 310squaremile christian enclave is about evenly 
split between aoun and geagea 
in a threeminute televised address friday aoun urged 
christians to rally behind your army he said the lebanese 
forces would enforce a peace agreement mediated by the arab league 
last fall which he rejects 
hrawi was elected by parliament to carry out the peace plan in 
an attempt to end lebanons 15yearold civil war which has cost 
more than 150000 lives

a union official who was allegedly shot on 
reputed mob boss john gottis orders testified for the defense 
friday in gottis assault trial saying he couldnt identify the 
people who nearly killed him 
john oconnor former vice president of carpenters union local 
608 had refused to testify for the prosecution but under 
questioning by defense lawyer gerald shargel he detailed the 
shooting of may 7 1986 
oconnor 56 said he noticed four or five men hanging around 
outside his union locals offices when he arrived there about 645 
that morning 
while waiting for the elevator oconnor said he heard a 
thunderous clap and felt something in his body although he did 
not realize he had been shot 
a man shouted mr oconnor mr oconnor and the union 
official said he turned and saw a man pointing a gun at him 
the elevator arrived and oconnor said he got on as the gunman 
fired more bullets into his buttocks 
the union official said he got off the elevator at the seventh 
floor saw an acquaintance and said please help me ive been 
shot several times 
jose corvalan the surgeon who treated oconnor at the hospital 
said the victim would have died without prompt medical treatment 
oconnor said that in viewing police photos he was never able to 
identifiy any of the men he saw outside his office the day he was 
shot 
gotti 49 the reputed gambino crime family head whos noted for 
his snappy attire and anthony guerrieri 60 an alleged gambino 
soldier are on trial in manhattans state supreme court on charges 
of assault and conspiracy in the oconnor shooting 
prosecutors say gotti had oconnor shot for leading union goons 
to wreck bankers and brokers a gambinoaffiliated restaurant 
they maintain that a secretly recorded tape shows gotti saying 
oconnor needed to be busted up 
arguing the tapes are largely inaudible the defense said that 
if the comment was clear enough to prosecute gotti it was clear 
enough for authorities to warn oconnor 
the defense which rested friday argued that oconnors enemies 
in his union might have shot him because of internecine rivalries 
oconnor said he initially told police that union trouble had 
nothing to do with the incident but conceded in testimony that 
within the union we were having problems 
under crossexamination oconnor answered questions about the 
attack on him and about the 127count indictment charging him with 
perjury extortion and labor racketeering 
but he asserted his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination when asked about his alleged links to organized 
crime and about his ownership of certain properties 
testimony suggested that oconnors union was tied to the 
genovese gang 
oconnor took the stand after acting justice edward mclaughlin 
denied a defense motion to dismiss the case or to instruct the 
jury that in an earlier trial the prosecution had presented a 
different theory about the bankers and brokers incident 
gottis lawyer bruce cutler said he thought it was significant 
that oconnor had refused to testify against gotti for the 
prosecution and that the defense had subpoenaed him 
mclaughlin said the jury will hear closing arguments monday and 
will get his final instructions tuesday

a military tribunal convicted four top 
officials under ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu of 
being accomplices to genocide and sentenced then to life in prison 
friday radio bucharest reported 
they were convicted of backing ceasescus orders to shoot 
demonstrators during the violent december revolution that toppled 
him after 24 years 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed by firing squad on 
dec 25 
the fivejudge tribunal the first to try leading figures in the 
ceausescu government rejected a prosecution demand that the four 
men be convicted of the more serious crime of coauthorship to 
genocide 
both charges are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in 
prison but the minimum terms are different lawyers said 
the panel ordered seizure of all property belonging to the four 
including gold jewels and large sums of money and stripped them 
of their civil rights 
the four who had already pleaded guilty to the charge of 
complicity to genocide stood solemnly as the tribunal 
president col andrei nitoiu announced the majority verdict after 
two hours of deliberation 
three of the four defendants emil bobu 62 former secretary 
of the communist party central committee and no 3 in the ceausescu 
leadership former state council vice president manea manescu 74 
and former politburo member ion dinca 62 stared at the judges 
showing no emotion as the verdict was read 
former interior minister tudor postelnicu 59 bowed his head 
as he had during much of the fiveday trial 
the national salvation front which took power during the 
revolution abolished the death penalty making life in prison the 
maximum penalty 
bobu postelnicu and manescu said they would appeal but dinca 
told the judge he would not manescu while saying he was guilty 
had asked for a lesser sentence than the others saying he had no 
part in repressing demonstrators 
the four politburo members admitted they backed ceausescus 
orders to shoot scores of demonstrators and did nothing to end his 
dictatorship but all denied they gave direct orders to put down 
the protests 
the military prosecutor col aurel cosma urged the judges to 
imprison all four for life on behalf of the thousands of victims 
of orphans children men women and brave military men who were 
killed in the revolution 
western diplomats have said up to 10000 people died in the 
fighting between ceausescus securitate forces and citizens who 
joined with the army 
ceausescu and his politically powerful wife fled bucharest by 
helicopter on dec 22 but were arrested convicted of genocide and 
of ruining romanias economy in a secret summary trial and were 
executed 
the prosecution charged the four defendants could have prevented 
the genocide that killed at least 689 people and injured 1281 by 
asking ceausescu to resign but instead they backed his order to 
shoot the demonstrators 
the prosecutor asked for the stiffer charge of coauthorship 
to genocide thursday saying a colleague drafted the charges 
incorrectly 
both charges are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in 
prison but the minimum terms are different lawyers said

blue 
lebron died wednesday in front of the wilson avenue candy store 
in the brooklyn neighborhood known as bushwick he was shot behind 
the right ear by officer frank albergo who thought he saw lebron

shot in the back by officer hyda hernandez after he allegedly 
lowered his hands and turned toward the officer liranso was 
unarmed the officer has been suspended and a grand jury is 
examining the case

there were 25 and in 1987 14 
new police commissioner lee brown on friday promised bushwick 
residents a thorough and complete investigation and 
appropriate action based upon the facts of the case 
i think the community will always be saddened when someone 
loses a life and when young people lose their lives it is an even 
sadder event said brown for us it is always tragic when 
police officers are involved in the incident 
lebrons death has angered neighbors and friends who said he 
had been a happy kid but one officer on the beat said lebron was a 
neighborhood tough who bullied others and was always on the 
street hanging out and drinking 
what we want is justice we want the officer to pay for what 
he did said lebrons 22yearold brother ruben he said he had 
been eating dinner with his brother just 15 minutes before he died 
ill be right back ruben lebron recalled his brother saying 
as he ran out the door to get a soda 
friends spraypainted lebrons graffiti tag name rase in 
8foot red letters on a building around the corner from where he 
was killed 
hundreds of residents marched on the local police precinct 
thursday night three were arrested after the crowd began throwing 
rocks and bottles at police in riot gear 
its just murder plain old murder one demonstrator said 
people are tired of this said one resident manuel vasquez 
38 were supposed to be more afraid of the criminals than the 
cops its getting not that way anymore 
a light rain fell friday outside the candy store where two 
lines of blood stretching from the sidewalk to the street were 
still visible four floral arrangements lay where lebron fell 
i feel like crying said 15yearold pearl cantres who 
added a single white rose to the pile she had also brought 
lebrons mother some flowers i was thinking it could have 
happened to me to my brother any of us she said 
she scrawled a message on cardboard with a black crayon may 
god take your soul and place it in a white box full of our tears of 
pain 
he was always smiling ruben lebron said wiping a tear from 
his cheek he was the clown of the block if this tragedy 
happened to someone else hed make us laugh 
bushwick is also where a woman who had tried to rid her 
neighborhood of drugs was slain last summer police speculate that 
maria hernandez was killed by angry dealers 
robert hernandez 17 recalled how neighborhood teenagers 
inspired by her death have since driven the dealers out of several 
other blocks 
were not no vigilantes he said we fight with words 
a hispanic police officer who held his hat over his nameplate 
as he described lebron as a neighborhood tough said the local 
youths wont back down if theyre with one another not even to

economic and other sanctions which they said had pushed the white 
authorities to reform 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral described 
president fw de klerks announcement as celestial music he 
hoped would herald the end of apartheid 
president bush called it quite positive and said he would 
review us sanctions a bush aide said both de klerk and mandela 
an anc leader when he was sent to jail would be invited to the 
white house 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said we call 
on all south african parties including those unbanned by president 
de klerk to take up this offer of negotiations and begin in 
earnest the process of a peaceful transition to a nonracial 
democratic south africa 
the soviet union said the measures were an important and 
longexpected step in the right direction but the official news 
agency tass quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying it is 
necessary that they should be followed by practical actions such 
as lifting the state of emergency 
prime minister margaret thatcher called de klerks speech a 
historic landmark invited de klerk to london and lifted cultural 
and academic embargoes 
we believe in carrots as well as sticks and theyve had plenty 
of the latter they should now have some of the former said mrs 
thatcher who has been instrumental in thwarting harsh 
international measures against south africa 
the prime minister who said she will also invite mandela to 
britain when the black nationalist leader is released said the 
us policy of disinvestment and tightening sanctions was a 
mistake 
british officials said that in due course she will raise the 
issue of easing embargoes in the european community and the 
commonwealth the 49nation association of britain and its former 
colonies 
in a speech that reversed decades of official policy de klerk 
also said he will legalize other black dissident groups declare a 
moratorium on executions and lift more measures under a state of 
emergency imposed in 1986 
sir shridath ramphal secretarygeneral of the commonwealth the 
49nation association of britain and its former colonies said 
south africa had reached a moment of hope 
but much of president de klerks announcement is a statement 
of intent ramphal said in a statement meanwhile all concerned 
must work to convert promise into performance and ensure that 
apartheid is ended 
canadas external affairs minister joe clark who leads a 
ninenation commonwealth committee monitoring sanctions said he 
was very encouraged 
black african nations south africas most hostile critics 
joined in guarded praise 
nigerias foreign affairs minister rilwanu lukman said de 
klerk had taken the first concrete step in the long journey 
toward the total eradication of apartheid and racial 
discrimination 
mozambique south africas neighbor played an excerpt of south 
african music on the state radio and the announcer declared de 
klerks speech allows us to see shining strongly a light at the 
end of a tunnel that once seemed infinite 
kenya and sierra leone both called the moves a step in the 
right direction 
in zambia where the exiled anc has been based president 
kenneth kaunda offered hearty congratulations for a job well 
started not well done i wish him de klerk the best of luck 
israel long suspected of helping south africa evade a mandatory 
international arms embargo and build nuclear arms welcomed the 
announcement israel will continue to follow favorably the 
process of reform taking place in south africa said foreign 
minister moshe arens 
foreign minister taro nakayama of japan called the measures 
crucial to starting blackwhite negotiations in south africa 
west germany france and other western european countries said 
south africa had moved in the right direction 
scandinavian nations forceful opponents of apartheid said the 
time was not right to relax economic sanctions 
the pressure of the south african regime must be kept up 
swedish prime minister ingvar carlsson said 
but dutch prime minister ruud lubbers said he expected the 
european community nations to meet soon to discuss lifting some 
embargoes the situation has changed fundamentally he said 
a wall has come down 
us sanctions have been the harshest of any imposed by south 
africas major trading partners the us congress has been 
considering bills that seek to place a total trade embargo and ban 
banks from rescheduling loans to south africa 
main measures by the 12nation european community are a ban on

feuding armenians and azerbaijanis opened 
peace talks friday and immediately found common ground both sides 
criticized the kremlin for sending troops to their southern region 
armenian negotiators told reporters that the use of the red army 
was unnecessary and was destabilizing the entire caucasus region 
which includes armenia azerbaijan and georgia 
the armenians and the azerbaijanis meeting in the western 
republic of latvia agreed to discuss the presence of the troops 
the estimated halfmillion refugees of both nationalities the 
ethnic conflict has created and other humanitarian issues 
both sides agreed not to raise the territorial dispute that 
sparked the unrest armenians want political control over 
nagornokarabakh a largely armenian district located inside 
azerbaijan but azerbaijanis want the region to remain in their 
hands 
baltic mediators leaders of the three peoples fronts movements 
in latvia estonia and lithuania said the talks could last two to 
three months 
in baku the azerbaijani capital leaders of the azerbaijani 
peoples front met with soviet military commanders thursday and 
took a defiant stand raising their demand that all 17000 soldiers 
be withdrawn 
lt gen vladimir s dubinyak the military commandant promised 
to transmit the demand to moscow said tofik gosymov one of the 14 
directors of the peoples front 
if the question of the removal of the soldiers is not solved 
we wont negotiate with them and we wont cooperate gosymov said 
he also said the military wanted to leave baku for its own 
reasons he did not elaborate 
the onehour talks at the azerbaijani interior ministry bypassed 
the azerbaijan communist party and the caucasus republics 
government underscoring the increasing clout wielded by the 
grassroots peoples front 
the party and government have been sharply criticized for 
failing to control violence that began jan 13 with attacks against 
armenian residents and continued when soviet troops stormed baku a 
week later 
at least 214 were killed and more than 500 injured in the 
unrest according to official reports friday the republics have 
been locked in a decadesold dispute largely centering on 
nagornokarabakh the armenians are mostly christian the 
azerbaijaini are predominantly shiite moslem 
during the talks with the military the peoples front also 
demanded release of arrested members and an explanation of what 
they said were military assaults on the groups headquarters 
dubinyak accompanied by his assistant for political affairs 
maj gen anatoly i kirilyuk and an official of the national 
interior ministry said those issues could only be decided in 
moscow gosymov reported 
gosymov said the peoples front needed at least a schedule for 
withdrawal to bring the situation in baku back to normal with such 
a schedule we can appeal to the people to go back to work and 
they will 100 percent he said 
soviet officials say more than 80 percent of bakus workforce is 
back on the job but the peoples front claims the figure is much 
lower 
on thursday dubinyak told reporters that the 11 pmto5 am 
curfew could be lifted and some soldiers withdrawn as early as 
midfebruary

the ruling national salvation front 
apparently will keep control of the government until may 20 
elections despite an accord with opposition parties to share 
power the fronts vice president said friday 
cazimir ionescu said the front will take half the seats in a new 
council of national unity agreed at a conference with 29 opposition 
parties thursday 
the national salvation front took absolute control of romania 
during the december revolution that toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu who was later executed along with his wife 
elena 
although the opposition said it accepted thursdays outcome as a 
true powersharing agreement the front will still apparently have 
the major say in running things until may romanians vote then in 
the first free multiparty elections here since shortly after world 
war ii 
the new 180member council is to be split evenly 90 from 
political parties and 90 romanian national figures and others from 
all walks of life a communique announcing formation of the council 
said farmers workers students and all other forces that took part 
in the revolution would be represented 
on saturday as its last act before dissolving itself the 
ruling council of the front will meet to decide whom to name as the 
90 nonpolitical appointees on the council of national unity 
ionescu told two westeren reporters if we should make the 
mistake of reshuffling the government before the elections 
this would mean that in the next two or three months we would see a 
destabilization of the economy 
we decided that the government would not have any political 
color but only a technocratic one 
he indicated that the current government installed by the 
fronts council would remain intact after the the council of 
national unity is established 
two members of the fronts council have resigned 
one dimitru mazilu who was council vice president quit after 
accusing the front of stalinist tactics 
asked if the new council of national unity would have veto power 
over government actions ionescu replied this will be decided 
during the future meetings by the council itself 
but he said the new council probably will decide the most 
important issues 
he said it will decide how to operate and whether to have a 
president 
but he considered it likely that interim president ion iliescu 
would continue in office under the new agreement citing the threat 
of instability otherwise 
asked if the opposition would oppose domination of the council 
of national unity by front appointees ionescu said if they 
didnt criticize it until now i dont think there could be 
anyone else who could criticize this fact 
as an apparent concession to the opposition the new governing 
council will have three members from each of the nations 29 
political parties as well as three from the front itself 
the front has agreed to transform itself into a political party 
and separate from its ruling council which now runs the government 
and has total control of all state apparatus including television 
and radio 
the opposition had protested against the fronts organizing the 
elections parceling out broadcast time to the different parties 
and at the same time fielding candidates itself 
the accord came after 10 days of violent pro and antifront 
street demonstrations including synchronized attacks on 28 
different headquarters of the national peasants party the dominant 
and bestorganized opposition group 
on friday a military tribunal convicted four former leaders of 
the ceausescu government of being accomplices to a genocide and 
sentenced then to life in prison radio bucharest reported 
found guilty of backing ceausescus orders to shoot 
demonstrators during the revolution were emil bobu 62 former 
secretary of the communist party central committee former state 
council vice president manea manescu 74 ion dinca 62 former 
politburo member and former interior minister tudor postelnicu 59

here are excerpts from president 
fw de klerks speech friday in which he legalized or lifted 
restrictions on more than 60 organizations including the african 
national congress and said the ancs jailed leader nelson mandela 
will be freed soon 
mr speaker members of parliament 
the general election on sept 6 1989 placed our country 
irrevocably on the road of drastic change underlying this is the 
growing realization by an increasing number of south africans that 
only a negotiated understanding among the representative leaders of 
the entire population is able to ensure lasting peace 
the alternative is growing violence tension and conflict that 
is unacceptable and in nobodys interest the wellbeing of all in 
this country is linked inextricably to the ability of the leaders 
to come to terms with one another on a new dispensation no one can 
escape this simple truth 
on its part the government will accord the process of 
negotiation the highest priority the aim is totally new and just 
constitutional dispensation in which every inhabitant will enjoy 
equal rights treatment and opportunity in every sphere of endeavor 
constitutional social and economic 
i hope that this new parliament will play a constructive part in 
both the prelude to negotiations and the negotiating process 
itself i wish to ask all of you who identify yourselves with the 
broad aim of a new south africa and that is the overwhelming 
majority 
let us put petty politics aside when we discuss the future 
during this session 
help us build a broad consensus about the fundamentals of a 
new realistic and democratic dispensation 
let us work together on a plan that will rid our country of 
suspicion and steer it away from domination and radicalism of any 
kind 
during the term of this new parliament we shall have to deal 
complimentary to one another with the normal processes of 
legislation and daytoday government as well as with the process 
of negotiation and renewal 
within this framework i wish to deal first with several matters 
more closely concerned with the normal process of government before 
i turn specifically to negotiation and related issues 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government is aware of the important part the world atlarge 
has to play in the realization of our countrys national interests 
without contact and cooperation with the rest of the world we 
cannot promote the wellbeing and security of our citizens the 
dynamic for south africa as well important advances have been 
made among precluded previously by ideological considerations 
i hope this trend will be encouraged by the important change of 
climate that is taking place in south africa 
for south africa indeed for the whole world the past year has 
been one of change and major upheaval in eastern europe and even 
the soviet union itself political and economic upheaval surged 
forward in an unstoppable tide at the same time beijing 
temporarily smothered with brutal violence the yearning of the 
people of the chinese mainland for greater freedom 
the year of 1989 will go down in history as the year in which 
stalinist communism expired

<TEXT>
the whole question of protecting individual and minority rights 
is still under consideration by the law commission therefore 
it would be inappropriate for the government to express a view on 
the details now however certain matters of principle have emerged 
fairly clearly 
the government accepts the principle of recognition and 
protection of the fundamental individual rights which form the 
constitutional basis of most western democracies 
it is neither the governments policy nor its intention that any 
group in whichever way it may be defined shall be favored above 
or in relation to any of the others

we have now reached the position that the death penalty 
should be limited as an option of sentence to extreme cases and 
specifically through broadening judicial discretion in the 
imposition of sentence and 
that an automatic right of appeal be granted to those under 
sentence of death 
</TEXT>

i wish to urge every political and community leader in and 
outside parliament to approach the new opportunities which are 
being created constructively there is no time left for advancing 
all manner of new conditions that will delay the negotiating 
process 
the steps that have been decided are the following 
the prohibition of the african national congress the pan 
africanist congress the south african communist party and a number 
of subsidiary organizations is being rescinded 
people serving prison sentences merely because they were 
members of one of these organizations or because they committed 
another offense which was merely an offense because of prohibition 
on one of the organizations was in force will be identified and 
released prisoners who have been sentenced for other offenses such 
as murder terrorism or arson are not affected by this 
the media emergency regulations as well as the education 
emergency regulations are being abolished in their entirety 
the security emergency regulations will be amended to still 
make provision for effecitive control over visual material 
pertaining to scenes of unrest 
the restrictions in terms of the emergency regulations on 33 
organizations are being rescinded the organizations include the 
following national education crisis committee south african 
national students congress united democratic front cosatu die 
blanke bevrydingsbeweging van suidafrika

regulations on 374 people on their release are being rescinded and 
the regulations which provide for such conditions are being 
abolished

regulations will be limited henceforth to six months detainees 
also acquire the right to legal representation and a medical 
practitioner of their own choosing 
these decisions by the cabinet are in accordance with the 
governments declared intention to normalize the political process 
in south africa without jeapardizing the maintenance of the good 
order they were preceded by thorough and unanimous advice by a 
group of officials which included members of the security community 
implementation will be immediate and where necessary notices 
will appear in the government gazette from tomorrow

which ran simultaneously on all the citys major television 
stations has flooded police lines with crime tips and may be 
duplicated in other cities later this year 
organizers of texas crackdown hailed the project for its 
cooperation by competing media 
the twohour program aired simultaneously on three network 
affiliates one independent tv station and three radio stations 
and was coordinated with newspaper coverage and programs in schools 
and by antidrug groups 
television stations and crimestoppers programs in houston san 
antonio chicago los angeles san francisco new orleans and 
kansas city are being contacted about producing local versions of 
the program said executive producer hugh akin 
in dallas response to the show overwhelmed organizers and law 
enforcement agencies 
arbitron ratings for jan 23 showed that texas crackdown 
was watched by 72 percent of the 17 million households that have 
televisions in the dallasfort worth area akin said 
we felt as though it would be effective but we did not expect 
the kind of overwhelming response we got said greg macaleese 
program coproducer and executive director of the greater dallas 
crime commission 
since the program aired the dallas police departments crime 
stoppers program has received up to six times its normal volume of 
daily calls officers said 
we are pleased police sgt barry whitfield said friday 
im sure much good will come of it 
one tip led to the arrest of a fugitive whose case was featured 
on the program and who was wanted on warrants issued by four law 
agencies 
about 1000 callers sought help from the dallas council on 
alcoholism and drug abuse in the week after texas crackdown 
aired akin said the council normally gets 183 calls a week 
the 50 phone tollfree lines set up to handle calls during the 
show were overloaded akin said adding hed double the number of 
lines for future programs 
producers are capable of doing six more shows in the next year 
and akin said they hope to negotiate deals with other majormarket 
tv stations by the end of february or early march 
in addition broadcasters in smaller markets around the country 
are considering single or multiplestation versions of the show 
he said akin and macaleese may consult with those stations akin 
said 
the two men raised 210000 from hospitals foundations and 
corporations to fund the project 
at least one school district has requested program tapes and 
others have made inquiries said macaleese for the first texas 
crackdown many school districts assigned homework and classroom 
projects based on a program questionnaire published in local 
newspapers 
akin said that the morning after one north texas couple watched 
the show their two teenage daughters admitted they had drug 
problems and were put in treatment programs 
we hope there will be more examples of such openness between 
kids and their parents because that is how the drug problem will 
get solved he said

the events in the soviet union and eastern europe weaken the 
capability of organizations which were previously supported 
strongly from those quarters 
the activities of the organizations from which the prohibitions 
are now being lifted no longer entail the same degree of threat to 
internal security which initially necessitated the imposition of 
the prohibitions 
there have been important shifts of emphasis in the statements 
and points of view of the most important of the organizations 
concerned which indicate a new approach and a preference for 
peaceful solutions 
the south african police is convinced that it is able in the 
present circumstances to combat violence and other crimes 
perpetrated also by members of these organizations and to bring 
offenders to justice without the aid of prohibitions on 
organizations 
about one matter there should be no doubt the lifting of the 
prohibition of the said organizations does not signify in the least 
the approval of terrorism or crimes of violence committed under 
their banner or which may be perpetrated in the future equally it 
should not be interpreted as a deviation from the governments 
principles among other things against their economic policy and 
aspects of their constitutional policy this will be dealt with in 
debate and negotiation 
at the same time i wish to emphasize that the maintenance of law 
and order dare not be jeopardized the government will not forsake 
its duty in this connection violence from whichever source will 
be fought with all available might peaceful protest may not become 
the springboard for lawlessness violence and intimidation no 
democratic country can tolerate that 
strong emphasis will be placed as well on even more effective 
law enforcement proper provision of manpower and means for the 
police and all who are involved with the enforcement of the law 
will be ensured 
it is my intention to terminate the state of emergency 
completely as soon as circumstances justify it there is still 
conflict which is manifesting itself mainly in natal province 
 
our country and all its people have been embroiled in conflict 
tension and violent struggle for decades it is time for us to 
break out of the cycle of violence and break through to peace and 
reconciliation 
with the steps the government has taken it has proven its good 
faith and the table is laid for sensible leaders to begin talking 
about a new dispensation 
among other things those aims include a new democratic 
constitution universal franchise no domination equality before 
an independent judiciary the protection of minorities as well as 
of individual rights freedom of religion a sound economy based on 
proven economic principles and private enterprise dynamic programs 
directed at better education health services housing and social 
conditions for all 
i wish to put it plainly that the government has taken a firm 
decision to release mr mandela unconditionally 
the government will take a decision soon on the date of his 
release unfortunately a further short passage of time is 
unavoidable in the case of mr mandela there are factors in 
the way of his immediate release of which his personal 
circumstances and safety are not the least he has not been an 
ordinary prisoner for quite some time because of that his case 
requires particular circumspection 
todays announcements go to the heart of what black leaders 
also mr mandela have been advancing over the years as their 
reason for having resorted to violence the allegation has been 
that the government did not wish to talk to them and that they were 
deprived of their right to normal political activity 
without conceding that violence has ever been justified i wish 
to say today to those who argued in this manner 
the government wishes to talk to all leaders who seek peace 
the unconditional lifting of the prohibition on the said 
organizations places everybody in a position to pursue politics 
freely 
the justification for violence which was always advanced no 
longer exists 
there is no longer any reasonable excuse for the continuation 
of violence the time for talking has arrived and whoever still 
makes excuses does not really wish to talk 
therefore i repeat my invitation with greater conviction than 
ever walk through the open door take your place at the 
negotiating table together with the government and other leaders 
who have important power bases inside and outside of parliament 
henceforth everybodys political points of view will be tested 
against their realism their workability and their fairness the 
time for negotiation has arrived 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
all reasonable people in this country by far the majority 
anxiously await a message of hope it is our responsibility as 
leaders in all spheres to provide that message realistically with 
courage and conviction if we fail in that the ensuing chaos the 
demise of stability and progress will forever be held against us 
 
i call on the international community to reevaluate its 
position and to adopt a positive attitude toward the dynamic 
evolution which is taking place in south africa

the national geographic society says 
alaska is where it belongs and shouldnt be moved closer to the 
center of the world map as a state senator requested 
alaska state sen jim duncan wrote to national geographic 
magazine editors saying too many maps show alaska on the left 
a constituent has written to me concerned that most world maps 
depict alaska at the extreme left rather than in the center part 
which would be accurate the juneau democrat said in his letter 
last month we dont mean to intimate alaska is at the center of 
the world even though it is for alaskans 
john garver the societys chief cartographer replied that the 
best way to produce a world map without cutting europe and asia in 
half results in alaskas placement way out at the top left corner 
the society in 1975 switched from producing maps with the united 
states in the center to ones with europe as the midpoint putting 
alaska on the left garver said 
we appreciate the dilemma with alaska in this situation but 
all things considered we feel that this is the best approach in 
displaying the continents and oceans of the world garver said 
i felt they were a little bit defensive in their reply 
duncan said thursday 
earlier this week the house passed a resolution asking book 
publishers magazines and newspapers to put the state in the 
northwest corner of the united states instead of off the california 
coast

university of wisconsin regents refused 
friday to expel the reserve officers training corps a move sought 
by a faculty group to protest the militarys ban on enlisting 
homosexuals 
the board voted 133 to accept the recommendation of university 
president kenneth shaw which calls for an aggressive lobbying 
effort to reverse the pentagon policy 
shaws recommendation was adopted rather than a facultybacked 
resolution that demanded rotc be expelled in 1993 if the military 
continued to deny enlistment to homosexual men and women 
i think it was the appropriate resolution to pass said 
regent erroll davis jr this resolution keeps the issue in the 
front line and will force us to deal with it 
in december the faculty at uwmadison the systems largest 
campus approved a resolution asking the university to expel rotc 
from campus in 1993 if the military continued to ban homosexuals 
several other campus groups followed with similar resolutions 
shaw responded this week by saying he didnt believe severing 
the universitys ties to the military would effectively encourage 
the pentagon to change its policy furthermore eliminating 
military programs would hurt those students who benefit from them 
he said 
about 1300 students are enrolled in army navy and air force 
rotc programs throughout the systems 13 major campuses onethird 
are at uwmadison which has 42000 students 
the resolution approved friday differs from one approved by the 
regents in 1987 because it requires uw administrators to report 
annually to the board on the progress of its efforts to change the 
militarys policy 
we intend to hold their feet to the fire regent ruth clusen 
said referring to uw administrators writing letters isnt going 
to get us anywhere 
the 1987 resolution which said the university would lobby the 
military was criticized for being too broad and ineffective 
capt cheryl batterman head of uw recruiting for the air force 
rotc was pleased the regents rejected the facultys recommendation 
but said the resolution might make it hard to lure students to uw 
campuses 
were already feeling the pinch she said i had hoped 
they wouldve gotten this all resolved at once now we still dont 
know what might happen thats a hard plan to sell to students and 
parents

the justice department on friday urged a delay 
in turning over 33 excerpts from former president reagans diaries 
to irancontra defendant john poindexter and said a summary of the 
entries should be compiled for poindexters use instead 
us district court judge harold greene had set a deadline of 
monday for reagan to give the nearly three dozen excerpts to his 
former national security adviser who is scheduled to go on trial 
feb 20 
in urging a postponement the justice department said many of 
the 33 entries duplicate material that came to light in last years 
irancontra trial of former white house aide oliver north 
indeed there may be no information in the diary entries 
covered by greenes court order that is not in the public 
domain the justice department said in a fivepage brief 
it said irancontra prosecutors and poindexters lawyers should 
attempt to draft a stipulation covering the facts contained in the 
diary entries greene can then compare the proposed stipulation 
with the diary entries to ensure that all pertinent information 
has been covered said the justice department 
a stipulation is an agreement on facts by both sides in a 
lawsuit 
we firmly believe that such an order is likely to obviate any 
need for the diary entries to be disclosed said the justice 
department the court will thereby avoid a possible 
constitutional confrontation and the serious potential for delay 
such a confrontation would cause 
president reagan could raise the defense of executive privilege 
and argue that under the constitution he does not have to turn 
over confidential documents used in reaching presidential decisions 
under the justice departments proposal poindexters lawyers 
would not be permitted to see the diary entries during any 
negotiating process therefore they almost certainly will oppose 
the plan 
the justice department noted that information in one of the 
diary entries concerning reagans call to the president of honduras 
already is summarized in stipulations from the north trial the 
telephone call focused on a shipment of ammunition for the contras 
that had been seized by a honduran military commander the honduran 
president assured reagan the commander would be ordered to deliver 
the ammunition to the rebels

greece will expel the turkish consul in 
the northeastern town of komotini who referred to greek moslems as 
fellow countrymen foreign minister antonis samaras said friday 
night 
samaras made the announcement after turkey refused to recall the 
consul kemal gur he did not mention deadline 
one of many issues in centuries of enmity between greece and 
turkey is whether the 120000 moslems in greece should be called 
greek moslems or ethnic turks 
gur has been accused of fanning passions between christians and 
moslems in thrace which borders turkey in northeastern greece 
the foreign minister said turkey insists on describing the 
moslem minority in our country as fellow countrymen or the 
equivalent term citizens of turkish origin 
this position represents a blatant violation of the lausanne 
treaty which recognizes only the religious identity of the 
minority and refers to it as moslem for this reason samaras said 
turkey committed unacceptable interventions in the domestic 
affairs of our country he said consequently the greek 
government is forced to proceed with the expulsion of the turkish 
consul general in komotini 
the lausanne treaty of 1923 calls for an exchange of populations 
and an end to hostilities between greece and turkey and specifies 
that moslems in greece be called greek moslems 
the latest trouble began when two prominent moslems were 
convicted of distributing election campaign material referring to 
moslems as turkish moslem which is illegal a court in komotini 
sentenced ahmet sadik a former member of parliament and local 
politician ibrahim sherif to 18 months in prison each 
moslems protesting the sentences clashed with christians on 
tuesday in komotini scores of shops belonging to moslems were 
damaged 
other charges are pending against sadik including disseminating 
false information 
a prosecutor in thrace reported to the supreme court in athens 
that holding sadiks trial in komotini as planned would cause 
further protests and could lead to a breakdown of law and order 
legal sources said the court was considering a change of venue

a former world health organization consultant 
accused of sending out computer diskettes that crippled computers 
in six countries appeared in federal court friday in an extradition 
case 
joseph w popp 39 is charged in warrants issued by scotland 
yard in london with blackmail and extortion for distributing the 
diskettes which were said to contain information on aids he was 
arrested thursday and is being held on a federal fugitive warrant 
popp told us magistrate joseph w bartunek he was under a 
psychiatrists care and must take medication for a mental condition 
bartunek said he would schedule another court hearing after popp 
is evaluated by two psychiatrists to see if he is competent to face 
extradition proceedings a hearing date wasnt set and popp was 
ordered to remain in the bedford heights jail in suburban cleveland 
popp of willowick about 10 miles east of cleveland was 
arrested thursday 
popps attorney john p kilroy had asked that his client be 
kept in a hospital rather than jail because of his mental condition 
hes an internationally respected researcher kilroy said 
i dont think hed pose any risk to flee 
kilroy said popp is an anthropologist and until december had a 
contract with the genevabased world health organization working 
sometimes in england but mainly in geneva and africa 
gary d arbeznik assistant us attorney in cleveland said an 
arrest warrant was issued in london on jan 18 contending popp 
mailed about 20000 diskettes from that city about dec 11 
the us attorneys office in cleveland said the diskettes had 
information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome for hospitals 
researchers and government agencies those who used the program 
subsequently found they were unable to retrieve data from their 
computers 
at the time the diskettes began causing problems in early 
december london authorities said it had been received by users in 
britian norway sweden belgium denmark and california 
arbeznik said the diskette packages included a warning that if 
the diskette were inserted into a computer a leasing fee would be 
charged 
the program instructed the computer user to send a fee of up to 
378 to a company called pc cyborg with a panama address federal 
prosecutors said 
upon payment of the money the recipient would receive a 
decontamination disk that would stop the computer virus 
authorities said 
it appears to me a clear warning was given on the 
package kilroy said in a telephone interview after popps court 
appearance the facts will show his actions were not criminal in 
nature

jesse jacksons 1988 presidential campaign 
negotiated a debt settlement with a california hotel owned by a 
jackson supporter but failed to report the debt or the agreement as 
required according to the supporter and election records 
the hotel owner a bruce rozet on friday confirmed a 75000 
jackson campaign bill at the hollywood roosevelt was settled for 
45500 but disputed an account by two former employers who said 
rozet a jackson delegate at the 1988 democratic convention 
forgave the remaining 30000 as a gift to jackson 
the jackson campaign said it did not believe it had violated the 
law it said it did not report the initial hotel bill as a debt 
because it disputed the bill and that it did report to the federal 
election committee the full amount of its ultimate payment 
but fec officials said the disputed bill should have been 
reported as a contested debt citing agency regulations requiring 
prompt reporting of all debts and an agency advisory opinion saying 
a disputed claim must be reported as a debt until paid or resolved 
rozet said it was a business negotiation based on the 
possibility that there had been overbilling and on the fact that 
the jackson campaign was good business for the hotel 
if a gift it would be an illegal contribution either by rozet 
who as an individual donor could give no more than 1000 to a 
candidate or by any of his companies corporations are prohibited 
from making political contributions in federal elections 
in any event federal election commission reports filed by the 
jackson campaign show only the 45500 payment to the hotel 
campaign finance laws require candidates to promptly report all 
debts in excess of 500 and all settlements for less than the 
initial bill amount 
the fec which is in the process of auditing the 1988 jackson 
campaign refuses as a general practice to say whether any matter 
is under investigation the hotel billing was first publicly 
disclosed friday in the washington post 
the campaign reaffirms that to the best of its knowledge it 
has always operated both within the spirit and letter of federal 
election laws the campaign said in a statement read by jackson 
aide frank watkins based on the information available to us all 
legitimate campaign bills involving the hollywood roosevelt hotel 
have been paid for in full 
jackon himself was traveling and unavailble for comment he told 
the post he was not involved in the negotiations with the hotel but 
did not believe rozet or his company had paid campaign expenses 
absolutely not jackson said first off we didnt need 
that kind of favor and second it would have been illegal 
rozet in a telephone interview friday said he had no role in 
the debt settlement asked about comments in the post account by 
two unnamed former hotel employers who termed the settlement a 
gift rozet said 
that is totally untrue if we were trying to hide it why did 
we bill him in the first place 
rozet said hotel managers contacted him when initial efforts to 
collect the bill were unsuccessful rozet said he referred the 
managers back to the jackson campaign and that one hotel employee 
was sent to jackson campaign headquarters to collect the bill 
my understanding of it was that there was some question as to 
whether some of the jackson people including traveling press and 
security people had been billed the top rate when they should have 
been billed at a group rate rozet said the fact is that the 
hotel had its best business when jackson was there with higher 
than normal occupancy when someone brings in that kind of 
business well negotiate with them thats not unusual we do if 
for conventions and other major events 
the post quoted an unnamed former hotel employee who said he 
tried to get the campaign to pay the bills but a jackson aide 
looked at me and said didnt mr rozet talk to you its all 
been taken care of 
rozet a longtime jackson ally and prominent democratic 
fundraiser said he has paid for jackson stays at the hotel in the 
past but said all predated the 1988 campaign and were for 
nonpolitical events including a 1987 birthday party rozet threw 
for jackson 
the general manager of the hotel bruno fava said friday of the 
jackson campaign they have no billing troubles im sorry 
but i have no comment otherwise 
as for the failure to report the initial debt or the settlement 
to the federal election commission james hewitt a cleveland 
attorney for the jackson campaign conceded the debt should have 
been reported 
it should have been listed as debt he told the post 
declining further comment hewitt did not immediately return 
telephone calls friday

the nations largest senior citizen group on 
friday opposed proposals to cut social security taxes saying the 
systems mounting reserves will be needed to ensure full benefits 
for future generations 
the american association of retired persons had been courted by 
both fans and foes of sen daniel patrick moynihans proposal to 
cut the payroll tax that finances social security benefits 
aarp president louise crooks said the association was 
concerned with the potential loss of 55 billion or more in 
annual revenue if the social security payroll tax is rolled back 
the associations first preference remains retaining existing 
social security policy to continue to build the reserves for future 
generations she said 
the policy was adopted by the aarps sixmember executive 
committee acting on a recommendation from its 32member 
legislative council 
moynihan a new york democrat is concerned that social 
securitys growing trust fund reserves are being used to mask the 
true size of the federal deficit and to pay for other government 
programs 
his solution is to halt the buildup of the reserves and to 
return social security to a payasyougo system in which taxes 
would be raised in the next century to finance retirement benefits 
for the baby boomers 
mrs crooks said that while there are legitimate concerns about 
how the social security trust funds are being used aarp is not 
prepared to give up on the effort to bring down the federal 
budgets operating deficit 
the group was careful to credit moynihan widely respected as an 
advocate for social security for drawing attention to the problem 
americans of all ages are indebted to senator moynihan for 
sparking the debate on the federal deficit and the future of social 
security mrs crooks said senator moynihan has correctly and 
dramatically defined the problem 
aarp said that if the budget accounting problem cannot be 
resolved in a reasonable amount of time then adoption of 
payasyougo financing for social security will have to be 
seriously considered 
moynihan thanked the aarp for its careful consideration of 
his proposal and said the group is in complete agreement with 
him that the current budget accounting system is inadequate 
what we absolutely agree upon is that the trust funds can no 
longer be used as general revenue moynihan said 
aarp with 31 million members aged 50 and over is considered 
the most powerful organization among advocacy groups for the 
elderly other advocacy groups also have voiced concern about the 
moynihan proposal

president fw de klerk legalized 
the african national congress on friday and promised to free nelson 
mandela a historic concession to the epic struggle for freedom by 
the nations black majority 
thousands of blacks thronged the streets of several cities to 
celebrate the announcements by de klerk in a 40minute speech that 
was widely hailed as courageous 
but black activists and several countries said despite the move 
to legalize the anc and dozens of other antiapartheid groups the 
whiterun government must now follow through de klerk did not act 
to dismantle the foundation of the apartheid system that would give 
south africas 28 million blacks a direct voice in running the 
country 
activists white businessmen liberal politicians and foreign 
governments praised the courage of de klerk who scrapped many 
other restrictions on opposition activity in a bid to draw the anc 
into negotiations on south africas future 
its incredible what he said has certainly taken my breath 
away said anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize for his opposition to apartheid we could say 
that we are probably seeing history in the making in south africa 
president bush called the move quite positive and said he 
will review us sanctions on south africa an aide said de klerk 
and mandela will be invited to the white house when the black 
leader is released 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain described de klerks 
announcement as a historic landmark and lifted cultural and 
academic embargoes 
the exiled anc said de klerks announcements go a long way to 
creating the climate conducive to negotiations but the 
zambiabased organization which has been fighting a guerrilla war 
almost 30 years said more changes were needed before talks could 
begin 
if the two sides begin negotiations quick breakthroughs appear 
unlikely 
the anc and all leading antiapartheid groups demand a 
oneperson onevote democracy which de klerk opposes saying it 
will result in the 28 million blacks dominating the 5 million 
whites another three million people of mixed race and 850000 
asian and indians make up the 37 million south africans 
de klerk since taking office in august has said he envisions 
some type of system in which no single racial group would dominate 
mandela 71 the countrys bestknown black leader would be 
freed shortly de klerk said but he said personal circumstances 
and safety were among the factors delaying the release 
i want to put it plainly that the government has decided to 
release nelson mandela unconditionally he said unfortunately 
a further short passage of time is unavoidable 
tutu agreed with de klerks assessment saying there may be 
people a lunatic fringe who would want to subvert the process by 
liquidating him i think that we have to accept that there are 
certain constraints 
de klerk said he would lift bans on more than 30 outlawed groups 
and scrap restrictions on a similar number he pledged to free most 
prisoners jailed for belonging to these groups declared a 
moratorium on executions and lifted most of the restrictions 
imposed during a 43monthold state of emergency 
these were the principal steps demanded by mandela and the anc 
as conditions for negotiations on a new constitution that would end 
the black majoritys exclusion from national politics 
the season of violence is over the time for reconstruction 
and reconciliation has arrived de klerk said in his speech 
greeted with cheers from supporters and silence from the rightwing 
opposition 
de klerk said his cabinet unanimously agreed on the decision and 
the action on legalizing the groups requires no action from 
parliament or any other branch of government 
andries treurnicht leader of the proapartheid conservative 
party challenged de klerk to call an immediate election for white 
voters to see whether they backed his decisions 
we say he has no mandate for doing the drastic things he 
intends doing treurnicht said 
at the perimeter of the parliamentary buildings about 5000 
demonstrators many chanting anc anc joined a march demanding 
mandelas release 
in cape town johannesburg and durban the three largest cities 
thousands of blacks sang and danced in the streets to celebrate the 
ancs legalization 
police said marchers threw stones at them in johannesburg and 
ordered the crowd to disperse they then fired tear gas no arrests 
or serious injuries were reported 
the groups to be legalized in addition to the anc include the 
smaller pan africanist congress guerrilla movement the south 
african communist party and the united democratic front a 
nationwide antiapartheid coalition 
the united democratic front which is aligned with the anc 
welcomed de klerks changes but called for sanctions to remain in 
place 
to lift sanctions now would be to run the risk of aborting the 
process to democracy it said in a statement 
de klerk said he was lifting restrictions imposed on 374 
activists following their release from detention 
he said stateofemergency detentions would be limited to a 
maximum of six months and emergency restrictions on the media would 
be scrapped except for some unspecified controls over photographic 
and television coverage of unrest 
mandela 71 has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping plan the start of the ancs sabotage and 
bombing campaign he has met with de klerk other government 
officials and antiapartheid leaders over the past several months 
in talks aimed at clearing the way for negotiations 
the anc was outlawed in 1960 after 48 years of nonviolent 
campaigning for black rights in 1961 it launched its sabotage 
campaign 
in the past year the guerrilla campaign has subsided markedly 
the ancs exiled leadership has acknowledged that its military 
options were limited and that it favored negotiations if de klerk 
was willing to allow unrestricted black political activity 
the allegation has been that the government did not wish to 
talk to them the anc and the pan africanist congress and that 
they are deprived of their right to normal political activity de 
klerk said 
the unconditional lifting of the prohibition places 
everybody in a position to pursue politics freely he added 
the justification for violence which was always advanced no 
longer exists

alexander lilov the new chief of the 
bulgarian communist party is a reformer who advocates open and 
truthful news media and who is reputed to have devised a new more 
liberal policy for the countrys 15 million ethnic turks 
lilov 56 emerged as the new party leader on friday after an 
emergency overnight session of the communist party replacing petar 
mladenov who remains in the newly separated post of state 
president 
lilov is a party veteran who was shunted aside under longtime 
party leader todor zhivkov himself ousted last november he has 
said he recognizes the need for the party to be revamped before it 
faces multiparty elections in may 
the bulgarian communist party should adopt the tactic of more 
businesslike work in order to regain confidence and to fulfill the 
hard tasks which it has to solve lilov told delegates after his 
election 
lilov must still convince a growing opposition and an 
increasingly skeptical general public that he is serious about 
reform and capable of enacting significant changes 
at a news conference when he was voted into the ruling politburo 
in december lilov charged that the legacy of zhivkovs 35year 
regime was a degradation of party principles and ethics 
the most important question to ask is why the system breeds 
dictators and why it tolerates them for so long he said 
that news conference gave an indication of lilovs stand on 
reforms and his potential as an emerging leader in the party after 
zhivkov had kept him from the power center for six years 
we have no illusions that if socialist society fails to 
restructure it will not be able to emerge from the crisis lilov 
said 
he also advocated a more open information policy including 
permission for ordinary people to speak up 
we need to destroy the information monopoly and ensure 
genuine openness of mass media so it could report on developments 
in an objective way and give all bulgarian nationals a chance 
to speak lilov said in december 
it was lilovs reformist views and criticism of the former 
communist strongman now in jail that led to his dismissal from 
the politburo in 1983 
after zhivkovs ouster lilov made a spectacular comeback 
informed sources said he was in charge of bulgarias new policy on 
its turkish minority 
bulgaria recently reversed an assimilation campaign vigorously 
imposed by zhivkov last month the leadership announced that those 
who fled to neighboring turkey were now free to return to home and 
reclaim their property 
about 300000 ethnic turks emigrated to turkey the past two 
years to escape persecution and harassement in bulgaria about 
50000 later returned 
we are well aware the matter is acute and part of the current 
crisis lilov said in december 
he was one of the first communist leaders to publicly advocate 
the rights of the minorities regardless of their ethnic identity or 
religious beliefs based on provisions in international human 
rights commitments 
born in 1933 in a village in northwestern bulgaria lilov holds 
a doctorate in bulgarian language and literature after 
philological studies in sofia and moscow 
after work in the communist youth union in the late 1940s lilov 
became involved in local party organizations in 1972 he became a 
central committee member and secretary responsible for art and 
culture 
lilov was named a politburo member in 1974 in charge of 
ideology and culture but he was dismissed from the ruling body and 
as a central committee secretary in 1983 after he clashed with 
zhivkov over the personality cult surrounding the party chief and 
other issues 
lilov was director of the institute of contemporary social 
theories in sofia from 1985 until his december rehabilitation

foreign minister julio linares said 
friday that us invasion troops should leave when public order is 
assured although many panamanians dont believe that will be by 
the end of this month 
his remarks were the first by a government official here since 
president bush said in his state of the union address wednesday the 
troops would be out well before the end of february 
linares told reporters the troops should withdraw when we have 
the ability to maintain public order 
nearly 3000 remaining us invasion soldiers are expected to go 
home within the next few weeks but at least 13000 will remain as 
part of the regular soldiers stationed at us southern command 
bases under terms of the 1977 panama canal treaties 
the united states invaded panama on dec 20 to overthrow manuel 
antonio noriega who faces drugs charges in miami 
maj gen marc cisneros commander of the the us army south 
the us ground forces in panama told a group of latin american 
observers thursday there is no threat of subversion to worry 
about 
others here are not that sure 
schoolteacher victoria jimenez said the americans should stay 
longer if they leave there could be a coup 
we want them to stay until they can train our new police 
force said a government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity i think this may be premature 
last week vice president ricardo arias calderon said publicly 
the us soldiers would leave when the country is secure 
one newspaper friday greeted the announcement that us troops 
moved from delta alert to charlie alert allowing them to leave 
bases and visit panama city with the headline 13000 soldiers 
will make their purchases here 
original estimates were that invasion forces would remain four 
to five weeks after overthrowing noreiga 
it was soon evident this was optimistic the government 
abolished the old defense forces the only armed authority in 
panama and asked the us army to act as policeman 
the us army became in effect a police force for the panamanian 
government while us forces guarded prisoners at military bases 
the new police force was being trained 
i dont want them to leave in february or ever said 
mechanic adrian rubio 42 what we should do is lease them some 
military bases we need the dollars 
cisneros said they are going to stay as long as necessary so 
i believe him more than i believe bush added ana perez 
another panamanian government official also speaking on 
condition of not being further identified said even if the 
invasion forces leave the americans will still be here at the 
bases and they can continue to train the police force 
people are afraid of going out at ngiht because of the 
criminal elements loose said mrs jimenez the americans 
should stay here longer 
this week two battalions of american infantry were in the darien 
jungle near the colombian border searching for remnants of 
noriegas loyalists or criminals 
we will stay here as long as the panamanian government feels 
we are needed cisneros said in a recent interview 
last sunday when vice presdient dan quayle attended mass with 
president guillermo endara parishioners waved signs that read 
americans do not go home

president bush welcomed as quite 
positive south africas announcement friday that nelson mandela 
would be freed and said he would talk with congress about the 
possibility of lifting us economic sanctions 
yet bush indicated any easing would depend on south africa 
making good on its promise to free mandela the leader of a 
formerly outlawed guerrilla movement and taking additional steps 
members of congress took similar or tougher stances with some 
urging bush to keep us sanctions in place they noted that south 
africas system of racial apartheid is still intact 
the sanctions should be maintained in full force this is no 
time to relax them said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
apartheid is crumbling as the berlin wall crumbled only a few 
months ago kennedy said attributing changes in the south 
african governments positions to pressure brought by the economic 
sanctions as well as to persistence of south african blacks 
the us sanctions include a ban on importing south african 
steel textiles uranium coal and agricultural produce they also 
bar new us investment in south africa forbid new bank loans and 
end us landing rights for south african airways 
kennedy and others also said bush should shelve his offer to 
invite south african president fw de klerk to the white house 
once mandela is freed 
i urge caution before that step is taken said sen paul 
simon dill chairman of a senate subcommittee on africa state 
visits involving south africa have been ruled out by past 
administrations as long as we continue to have fundamental 
differences with the south african government 
kennedy said simply that de klerk still represents one of the 
most abhorrent systems in the world 
bush also has announced he will invite mandela to the white 
house after he is freed 
in a speech to the south african parliament de klerk legalized 
the african national congress after three decades of guerrilla war 
against white rule he said mandela the anc leader who was 
imprisoned in 1962 would be freed but not immediately 
in addition de klerk said he would lift bans or restrictions on 
more than 60 other opposition groups free most prisoners jailed 
for belonging to these groups declare a moratorium on executions 
and scrap most of the restrictions imposed during more than three 
years of a state of emergency 
bush commented on the developments on air force one en route to 
appearances in raleigh nc and knoxville tenn 
very interesting and i would say quite positive the 
president said i view it positively and i think most people 
around the world will 
bush said that de klerk recognizes the status quo is not 
acceptable to him or to the people in south africa and to a lot of 
people in the world who want to see a more just society 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said a lot of 
conditions have to be met before bush would seek the removal of 
sanctions theres still a lot to be done before that happens 
stil bush said i think when people move in the right 
direction it is certainly time to review all policy 
we want to see the policy initiatives go forward and the 
release of mandela he said but he added i am one who has not 
favored additional sanctions so im perfectly willing to review 
things as new developments take place he added 
rep bill gray dpa also welcomed the south african 
developments but noted that a series of conditions in connection 
with the sanctions remain unmet releasing all political prisoners 
lifting the state of emergency legalizing political participation 
for all parties repealing laws that regulate where nonwhites can 
live and work and beginning goodfaith negotiations with the black 
majority 
all are essential in ending apartheid and restoring justice 
gray said 
the president can suspend or modify us sanctions if mandela 
and other political prisoners are released and pretoria meets at 
least three of the other conditions 
sen richard lugar rind former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee called de klerks actions a bold 
stroke for freedom and added the trend in events is south 
africa has been a strong one toward negotiation 
lugar said the us sanctions bill gives the president 
flexibility to remove some sanctions if south africa meets certain 
conditions but lugar said bush has promised to consult with 
congress before he takes any action 
in washington the rev jesse jackson said we must balance 
hope with caution caution because the structure of apartheid is 
still in place and nelson mandela is still in jail 
while de klerks announcement is a historic change in government 
policy it makes no immediate change in the system of apartheid 
that establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 
million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites continue to control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services

received such invitations needed to start emigration procedures 
israel expects up to 100000 immigrants to arrive in the next 12 
months last year 12000 soviet jews came here more than five 
times the 1988 number 
soviet jews complained of antisemitic incidents and 
demonstrations

gathering of writers shouting antisemitic slogans and causing a 
scuffle a soviet television report monitored in israel said 
the city prosecutor appeared on the tv saying they needed to 
look into the incident ms mendelevitch said but these thugs 
were not punished they found no criminal element in their 
actions 
later a frightened jewish author called friends in israel 
asking for an emigration invitation to be sent to him as soon as 
possible 
on jan 27 soviet tv broadcast a report that said members of 
the russian nationalist group pamyat or memory at a recent rally 
in moscow openly called for a jewish pogrom on may 5 
another tv report monitored in israel this week said city

yuri stern a soviet immigration activist who acts as an adviser 
to the israeli parliaments immigration and absorption committee 
on friday warned that the situation in the soviet union is such 
that the fact we still have not witnessed largescale pogroms is 
simply a miracle 
we have to do the maximum to allow for the exodus of soviet 
jews to use all the available transportation means to speed up 
all the processes that largely depend on us who knows how much 
time we have 
immigration activists asked the government to speed up the 
process of issuing invitations and explore possible routes for 
immigrants they say as many as 50000 to 100000 soviet jews who 
have received exit visas cannot leave because of ticket shortages 
soviet immigrants now arrive through hungary and romania but 
airplane tickets are in short supply reports from the soviet union

palestinian protests over the influx of immigrants to israel and 
remarks by the prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel suggesting

immigrants to the occupied territories

settlement of immigrating soviet jews in the occupied lands

we are firmly against the use at risk to their safety of 
persons leaving the ussr to force palestinians off land that 
belongs to them said moscows acting un ambassador valentin v 
lozinskiy in a letter to the secretarygeneral 
the israeli leadership must realize the dangrous consequences

friday that sovietjewish immigration to israel will spill over to 
augment the illegal settlements in the occupied territories 
in tunis tunisia arab league secretary general chedli klibi

allows large numbers of jews to emigrate to israel league sources

west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said friday he and secretary of state james a baker 
agreed that unification of germany would not mean extending natos 
military area eastward 
dramatizing the rush of developments on the issue of unifying 
east and west germany genscher crossed the atlantic friday for 
consultations with baker before the secretarys meetings next week 
with soviet leaders in moscow he was returning during the night to 
bonn 
we were in full agreement that there is no intention to extend 
the nato area of defensive security toward the east genscher 
said after their 2hour meeting at the state department 
that holds true for not only the east german democratic 
republic which we have no intention of simply incorporating but 
also for the other eastern countries he added to reporters in 
the state department lobby as baker stood beside him 
genschers blitz visit arranged earlier this week followed 
close on the heels of a surprise call by east german prime minister 
hans modrow for a single militarily neutral german state 
baker indirectly rejected the idea of neutrality for a future 
united germany by telling reporters that im frankly encouraged 
by what genscher has said about continued german membership in nato 
the german ministers statement about not extending the alliance 
eastward appeared to mean that such membership would cover only the 
western part of a unified germany 
baker also said we agreed we need to develop a process and a 
framework for unification taking into consideration the 
interests of all who are involved in the issue 
the two ministers also said the 35nation summit proposed for 
late 1990 by soviet president mikhail gorbachev should include not 
only formal signing of an agreement on reduction of ground forces 
in europe but also add free elections to the basic human rights 
enumerated at the original 35nation helsinki summit in 1975 on 
security and cooperation in europe 
baker said he and genscher agreed that any such summit should 
involve the inclusion of the right of free elections as an 
additional human right in the human rights basket of csce 
german unity appeared to be a major issue baker will take up 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze during their 
talks in moscow next thursday and friday he also will see 
gorbachev who on wednesday softened longstanding soviet 
opposition to german reunification 
genscher meanwhile is consulting with british and french 
officials as well as baker 
modrows plan is for a neutral single german state that would 
belong neither to the north atlantic treaty organization nor to the 
warsaw pact genscher has proposed that germany would be a nato 
member but that the portion that is now east germany would be a 
neutral military zone 
genscher has joined west german chancellor helmut kohl in 
rejecting neutrality for a future german state 
the meeting with baker was not scheduled because of the latest 
developments in east germany a us official said the idea 
was to meet with baker before his talks in moscow 
and yet the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the session was in context with fastmoving events 
genscher suggested the meeting last week 
a west german embassy official said meanwhile that genscher 
wanted to coordinate various positions with baker before his 
trip to moscow baker leaves monday night stopping first in 
prague czechoslovakia 
the embassy official who barred use of his name said genscher 
also wanted to discuss with baker the latest us proposal to 
reduce us and soviet troops in europe to 225000 each with a 
limit of 195000 in central europe meaning west and east germany 
and czechoslovakia

president bush pointing to concerns the 
united states is in danger of being dethroned as the world 
champion of science and technology urged congress on friday to 
swiftly approve his plan to boost spending on research and 
development 
bush went on the road to tout his plans to spend 71 billion on 
science and technology in fiscal 1991 and to respond to criticism 
that his education budget a proposed 2 percent increase over 1990 
is insufficient to improve performance in the nations schools 
the 71 billion is 45 billion more than the money enacted for 
1990 according to white house figures 
during his visit to two universities in tennessee and north 
carolina the president toured a semiconductor lab he termed 
awesome and stood in a pitchdark room for several minutes 
attempting to see an experiment involving microorganisms that 
control chemical pollution in contaminated water and soil 
in science and technology the united states is today the 
undisputed heavyweight champion of the world he told an audience 
at the university of tennessee 
yet some wonder if america has lost its competitive edge and 
ask if we must now look overseas for the answer bush said 
the united states is the defending world champion but we have 
to defend our title day by day week by week yearin and 
yearout the president said 
bush urged congress to approve his budget proposals in science 
including doubling spending for the national science foundation by 
1993 
building americas competitive strength today also means that 
we need quick congressional action on our other proposals for 
investing in new capital intellectual capital he said 
in answer to questions from students about federal funding for 
education however bush stressed that in terms of spending i 
still believe a lot of the emphasis has to be at the local and 
state level 
bush announced friday he was creating a 15member committee 
headed by white house science adviser allan bromley and including 
14 privatesector members to advise him on all areas of science 
and technology no names of members were released 
the white house also announced bush on monday will address the 
opening session of a united nations group that is working on the 
global warming issue the intergovernmental panel on climate change 
will meet at georgetown university in washington 
bush has been criticized for not taking a leadership role on 
global warming the announcement friday came after more than 700 
scientists representing more than a third of all members of the 
national academy of sciences accused him of being complacent about 
the global warming threat 
before arriving in knoxville bush toured a north carolina state 
university lab that studies semiconductor surfaces 
all this brainwork out here its a little awesome the 
president said 
bush participated in a discussion with a handful of technology 
company executives about their efforts to work with educational 
institutions on research projects 
several stressed the need to put more emphasis on science and 
math education before students reach college 
we simply cant wait for the schools to improve business must 
take an active role said richard daugherty of international 
business machines corp who said ibm spends 900 million a year to 
educate its own employees we need emphasis on math and science 
the improvement of education is fundamental to 
competitiveness daugherty said

an effort to retry a high school principal in 
the slayings of a teacher and her two children should be rejected 
because misconduct by the prosecutor the principals lawyer argued 
thursday 
the principal jay c smith was convicted in the 1979 killings 
subject of a book and tv miniseries called echoes in the 
darkness but the verdict was overturned in december by the 
state supreme court 
defense attorney william costopoulos argued in court papers that 
a second trial would violate smiths constitutional protection 
against double jeopardy or being tried twice on the same charges 
in a 105page motion filed in dauphin county court costopoulos 
also argued the state was guilty of misconduct alleging the 
prosecutor withheld evidence from the defense he also accused the 
prosecution of using hearsay testimony that was false and using a 
witness who committed perjury and then improperly freed from prison 
for his cooperation 
robert gentzel a spokesman for attorney general ernie preate 
jr said state lawyers believe the motion is without merit and 
we will vigorously oppose it 
smith was convicted in 1986 of murdering susan reinert and her 
children karen 11 and michael 10 he was sentenced to die in 
the electric chair 
in ordering a new trial the state supreme court said dauphin 
county judge william lipsitt erred by allowing the jury to consider 
hearsay testimony 
costopoulos had raised the prosecutorial misconduct allegations 
on appeal but the justices didnt consider that part of the 
argument once it determined the hearsay evidence was improper 
much of the motion focuses on two grains of sand that were 
apparently found on mrs reinerts feet the material attached to 
adhesive strips used to gather evidence was found by a state 
policeman in an evidence drawer during the last week of the trial 
but costopoulos didnt learn of their existence until nearly two 
years later 
smith contended the sand would have bolstered his defense that 
reinert was killed by another teacher william bradfield at the 
new jersey shore 
the attorney general contended that the material may have been 
planted by the defense and wouldnt have made any difference in the 
jurys verdict 
mrs reinerts nude and bruised body was found in the hatchback 
of her car in the parking lot of a suburban harrisburg hotel the 
childrens bodies never were found

women who carry their weight around the 
middle are more at risk for developing breast cancer than those who 
bulge at the hips and thighs according to a study published 
thursday 
in a separate study researchers said they have identified an 
enzyme that may help them predict which breast cancer patients will 
likely have a relapse of the disease 
the socalled apple vs pear study concerning fat and 
breast cancer was conducted by david schapira an associate 
professor who heads cancer prevention at h lee moffitt cancer 
center amp research institute at the university of south florida 
its not how much weight you have on your body but where you 
have it said schapira whose findings were published in the 
annals of internal medicine 
the florida study showed women with fat over the stomach and 
abdominal area are at six times the risk of developing breast 
cancer than those with fat deposits lower on the body schapira 
called women with upper body fat patterns apples and women with 
traditional lower body fat pears 
the team studied 216 breast cancer patients diagnosed between 
august 1987 and june 1988 and 432 healthy women they ranged in age 
from 25 to 83 
breast cancer patients had significantly greater deposits of 
upper body fat in several key body sites plus greater waisttohip 
and abdomentothigh comparison ratios researchers found 
the moffitt team thinks upper body fat leads to breast cancer 
because it disturbs the hormonal system breast cancer has been 
linked to obesity in previous studies cancer experts said but 
this study also looked at normalweight woman with breast cancer 
the second study published in thursdays new england journal of 
medicine said the presence of an enzyme called cathepsin d could 
help doctors determine which women should receive chemotherapy or 
radiation treatment after breast cancer surgery 
the enzyme appears to play a part in the rapid production of 
cancer cells according to the study 
doctors at the university of texas health science center in san 
antonio found that breast cancer patients with higher levels of the 
enzyme had 26 times the chance of a relapse and 39 times the 
possibility of dying in five years compared with those who had low 
levels of the enzyme 
the detection of the enzyme may help doctors shape treatment for 
breast cancer victims who dont show signs of the disease having 
spread a condition called nodenegative disease 
only about 30 percent of nodenegative patients experience a 
recurrence but until now doctors have been unable to figure out 
which patients were likely to be among those stricken a second time 
by measuring levels of the enzyme doctors may be able to target 
therapy to women who could benefit the most the national cancer 
institute now recommends that all nodenegative women receive 
chemotherapy which is both costly and painful 
the apple vs pear health disparity was in the news in another 
context last week when researchers in st louis reported a link 
between cholesterol levels and the distribution of body fat 
the study reported in last weeks new england journal of 
medicine showed people with fat waists have lower levels of hdl 
cholesterol the good cholesterol believed to protect against 
heart disease 
that study could help explain why women have lower rates of 
heart disease than men researchers said

a civilian editor at the pacific stars and stripes 
says a recommendation to name a civilian as chief editor and make 
it easier to hire and fire would not end problems at the us 
military paper 
dewey brackett who in congressional testimony has criticized 
conditions at the governmentrun paper said proposals by ombudsman 
philip m foisie could even weaken the newspapers integrity and 
its independence 
foisie a former foreign editor at the washington post and 
executive editor of the international herald tribune was named 
ombudsman for the two stars and stripes newspapers last june 
raising hopes of civilian staffers like brackett who complain of 
censorship and other problems 
the european stars and stripes published in west germany is 
edited separately from the tokyobased pacific paper 
last weekend the stars and stripes published a report on 
foisies interim recommendations on the editorship of the papers 
the ombudsman said he was issuing the proposals before his overall 
report on the pacific paper because the pentagon had announced that 
a us marine colonel would succeed the us air force colonel now 
carrying the title editor in chief of the paper 
foisie recommends that a military officer continue to command 
the papers mix of military and civilian staff members but with 
the title of publisher 
he said a civilian who has devoted his career to quality daily 
print journalism should be in charge of what appears in the 
newspaper 
he also recommends new personnel policies including the 
ability to dismiss editorial personnel expeditiously for what the 
publisher and editor regard as valid professional cause and to 
hire the best available journalists 
brackett said that would give less protection than civilian 
journalists have now 
col edwin j montgomery who retires this spring after four 
years as editor in chief said thursday the ombudsmans proposal 
looks workable to me i think its important to get the right 
person in the job of editor 
the pentagon is expected to consider the ombudsmans 
recommendations as well as congressional views 
meanwhile brackett and the papers okinawa bureau chief kate 
pound said a new directive from us pacific military headquarters 
in hawaii could restrict reporters freedom the directive makes 
stars and stripes reporters subject to decisions by base commanders 
to restrict offbase travel by us government employees 
ms pound said in a telephone interview that the rule could 
block stars and stripes reporters from reporting on antibase 
demonstrations or attacks on us troops in the philippines japan 
south korea or micronesia 
the papers reporters have no special access on military bases 
she said and now theyre saying that since we are government 
employees they can limit us offbase too 
if they get tough all were going to be able to cover is the 
opening of the officers wives club gift shop 
montgomery said us commanders are responsible for the safety 
of us government personnel but he added if we need to have 
those policies relaxed for the purposes of gathering news then we 
can request they be relaxed

organized crime 
the new york and newark nj locals of the ila are considered 
among the most influenced by organized crime said one government 
labor racketeering investigator 
the lawsuit would be similar to the action settled last year

attorney general dick thornburgh wants an 
independent counsel to determine if former housing secretary samuel 
r pierce jr and his aides broke the law by steering federal rent 
subsidies to politically connected developers 
thornburgh stressing that the special prosecutor law left him 
no other choice said an independent counsel is needed to determine 
if pierce and other former housing officials may have violated 
federal criminal law in the way they chose developers to 
participate in the moderate rehabilitation program between 1984 and 
1988 
the department of housing and urban development program provides 
rent subsidies and lucrative tax to developers who perform a 
moderate amount of rehabilitation on lowincome housing units 
thornburghs formal application to a special court cited reports 
of a widespread perception among developers and local officials 
that funds were being disbursed in disproportionate amounts to 
projects backed by prominent republicans acting as consultants or

a man with severe parkinsons disease showed 
marked improvement after receiving a transplant of brain tissue 
from an aborted fetus into his own brain european researchers 
report 
the transplanted fetal brain tissue apparently thrived and is 
producing dopamine a brain chemical that is essential for normal 
controlled muscle movements the researchers reported in a study 
published in science magazine today 
olle lindvall of the university hospital in lund sweden chief 
author of the report told the washington post that the study 
involving a single patient is very exciting and promising 
news but he cautioned that the study does not prove that we 
can get this effect in other patients or sustain it in this one 
parkinsons disease occurs when areas of the brain degenerate 
and stop producing dopamine a neurotransmitter essential for 
carrying signals from one part of the brain to another by 
transplanting fetal brain tissue into the affected area 
researchers hope to restore the production of dopamine

for all its tragic drama and cruel farce 
hollywoods anticommunist blacklisting has rarely been transformed 
into moneymaking cinema and that makes fellow traveller the 
surprise of the british movie season 
this lowbudget movie about american victims of american 
redbaiting is britishmade and set largely in britain 
the american film industry has always been a world film 
industry american culture is my culture as well explains 
michael eaton the english screenwriter 
fellow traveller he says organically involves both our 
countries 
the films budget of under 3 million was shared by home box 
office and the british broadcasting corporation with some 
assistance from the british film institute it opened jan 5 at 
londons tiny metro cinema where it broke the house record with an 
opening week gross of 20000 it will be seen in the united states 
march 3 on the hbo cable channel 
fellow traveller exemplifies the trend toward angloamerican 
crossfertilization in the movie and television industries and 
for once the balance of forces works perfectly wrote critic 
adam marsjones in the independent 
marsjones praised a screenplay full of sharpness and 
unpredictability while the observers philip french called it 
one of the most politically sophisticated visually imaginative 
british pictures of the past decade 
the hollywood blacklists resulted from the investigations of the 
house committee on unamerican activities into alleged communist 
infiltration of hollywood in the years after world war ii 
hollywood people blacklisted as communists or fellow 
travellers sympathizers were forced out of the movie 
business or given no alternative but to name others with communist 
leanings many careers in acting screenwriting and directing were 
destroyed a few victims committed suicide others worked under 
pseudonyms or fled to britain 
the legacy of those times still haunts the industry in 
december the lorimar studios changed the name of its robert taylor 
building after tenants complained in a petition that the late actor 
testified before congress against the socalled hollywood 10 
writers alleged to have associated with communist organizations 
during the 1930s 40s or 50s taylor also was considered a 
supporter of the blacklist that kept those writers from working 
under their own names 
in fellow traveller asa kaufman an american screenwriter 
moves to london to escape the witch hunt and earns a living writing 
screenplays for a robin hood tv series 
meanwhile back in hollywood redbaiting has driven actor 
clifford byrne kaufmans best friend to suicide woven into the 
story is the role of dr leavy a hollywood psychotherapist and 
communist sympathizer whose motivation is critical to the films 
denouement 
kaufman is played by ron silver byrne by hart bochner and leavy 
by daniel j travanti 
kaufmans robin hood screenplays become the ironic counterpoint 
to his predicament while flashbacks cleverly juxtapose the glamour 
and sunshine of hollywood with rainy britain its postwar austerity 
and the early days of its commercial television 
the film is loosely based on true incidents eaton used victor 
a navaskys book naming names for background kaufmans 
story somewhat parallels that of ring lardner jr who wrote over 
40 episodes of robin hood for britains independent television 
network between 1954 and 1960 the byrne character is reminiscent 
of john garfield who died at 39 of a heart attack some thought may 
have been brought on by pressure from the blacklisters 
the hollywood witch hunts are an episode rarely tackled headon 
by american moviemakers only in 1976 did a major movie on the 
subject emerge martin ritts the front starring zero mostel 
and woody allen in 1986 came peter yatess the house on carroll 
street with kelly mcgillis both films were written by blacklist 
victim walter bernstein 
most of what you find tend to be allegories of giant ants 
invading los angeles said eaton pulpy science fiction movies 
which only in retrospect came to be seen as veiled treatments of 
anticommunist hysteria 
other films dealt with the situation and problem in america 
from an american point of view said the movies british 
director philip saville 
fellow traveller is about a man who runs away from his 
country rather than face his predicament and drop his friends said 
saville who studied at columbia university in new york in 195556 
saville and eaton are teaming up for a second film set against 
the background of contemporary hollywood moviemaking

on east berlins austere marxengelsforum 
tourists climbed the bronze statue of the founders of communism one 
recent weekend and snapped funky pictures for showing back home 
as the camera clicked they pulled at karl marxs beard kissed 
his cheek sat on his shoulder and draped themselves over his knees 
not long ago they could have landed in jail for that but 
tourists have been pouring into east berlin since the wall came 
tumbling down and decorum isnt being forced upon them 
at the brandenburg gate excited japanese tourists hoisted one 
another onto the berlin wall while one of their number recorded it 
on video tape 
east berlin has tapped a new treasure trove in tourism courtesy 
of geopolitics 
we are here to look around and to be part of history said 
peter bailey of marlow england as he was moved through customs at 
east berlins friedrichstrasse train station 
after we saw what happened on television we decided to come 
and see for ourselves 
in western europe travel industry officials say bookings for 
bulgaria romania and czechoslovakia have more than doubled in some 
cases since the revolutions there but berlin east and west is 
special 
here western luxury and eastern communism are within walking 
distance of each other 
west berlin benefits as well 
it is a unique situation in the world said west berlins 
tourism spokesman michael brodersen and because of it west 
berlins tourism industry is thriving 
nothing is laidback nowadays at the hotel california on west 
berlins fancy kurfuerstendamm now travelers must book three weeks 
in advance to get a room when in the past at this time of year the 
hotel was usually more than half empty 
for the first time christmas and new year were fully booked 
and we have a lot more bookings until the summer than other 
years brodersen said of hotels in west berlin which had 21 
million visitors last year 
the biggest increase came from american tourists brodersen 
said most of whom flock to the crumbling berlin wall 
i just came over to get a little chunk of wall said francis 
scott a retired engineer from orlando fla who first came here 
with the 82nd airborne division in 1945 as part of the american 
occupation force he was with the 24th infantry division in munich 
when the berlin wall went up aug 13 1961 
was chiseling away at the stubborn concrete special to scott 
emotional absolutely it is emotional for the whole damn 
world he said 
tom erlbeck of omaha neb hurt his hands getting a piece of 
the wall 
all my relatives are from germany so it means a bit more to 
me said the third generation american im getting a piece of 
history for family and friends 
nearby local people were selling pieces of the wall 
americans come with big bags and take what they can get 
said one seller identifying himself only as carl his pieces sell 
for up to 1760 each 
but for some paying for a piece of the wall is not the real 
thing 
buy never its like prostitution scott the former gi 
said it has no significance whatsoever 
other tourists in the area didnt think having a piece of 
concrete bore any special no significance 
it is an absolute absurdity to chop away at a wall said 
anton van nieuwpoort a dutch tourist 
i came to see and experience a society which developed 
differently than ours 
at the hotel california an employe also took a dim view of the 
wall chiselers 
they should have done that 10 years ago when it would have 
meant something he said now they just want to have fun 
in east berlin history can get more palpable than the wall 
itself 
tou rists had a frontrow seat at one recent prodemocracy 
protest near the alexanderplatz 
and on the square itself some got swept up in a tide of east 
berliners rushing toward a stand selling bananas bananas are still 
a rarity in east germany 
that picture of east berlin contrasts sharply with unter den 
linden the citys fancy main thoroughfare and key tourist 
attraction with its bevy of 18thand 19thcentury wedding cake 
buildings 
but tourist eric demuynck from belgium found a different more 
predictable east berlin just blocks away 
walking through depressing neighborhoods still scarred by 
shrapnel from world war ii he said this is what i expected to 
find

its the 12th winter of civil war for 
the rugged people of afghanistan but in the snow and mud of this 
capital new hopes bud that spring will bring peace 
sounds of the bitter struggle between government forces and 
moslem guerrillas still rattle kabul but for the first winter in a 
decade soviet troops arent pulling the triggers and more and 
cheaper food is in the larder 
now it is just brother against brother there is less fighting 
now said ahmad amir shah as he jerked his yellow moskvich taxi 
to avoid a shower of gray slush from an oncoming army truck 
however the guerrillas rockets still slam into the city daily 
spreading panic in the mudbrick warrens that house most of kabuls 
2 million people 
the usbacked guerrillas known as the mujahedeen holy 
warriors are just beyond the jagged mountains ringing the city 
government soldiers some of them too young to shave respond 
with artillery fire late at night scud missiles launched from 
secret government bases north and south of the city roar like 
freight trains through the darkness hurtling east toward the main 
battlefronts near the border with pakistan 
but in kabuls teeming markets a bounty of food unlike last 
winters scarce rations hints at better times 
turbaned men wrapped to their noses in thick brown shawls barter 
with vendors in the muddy shor bazaar along the kabul river 
the vendors carts are heaped with apples oranges 
pomegranates nuts and crispy slabs of unleavened naan bread 
chickens squawk in wicker baskets and great hunks of beef and 
mutton hang in the open air there are even pastries and sugar 
candy 
a naan the size of a dinner plate costs 8 cents down from 10 
cents a year ago when many bakeries shut down for lack of flour 
now available at 2 a 15pound sack 
a pound of mutton is about a fourth lower than a year ago at 52 
to 70 cents depending on the cut 
this years availability and prices mean that bread and meat 
the staples of the afghan diet are within reach of more people in 
afghanistan where the average familys annual income is about 350 
in the money changers bazaar the local currency the afghani 
is strengthening against the dollar it took 525 afghanis to buy a 
dollar on jan 1 and by the end of the month it took just 500 
business is getting slightly better but in the future who 
knows it depends on politics and the war said raja kumar one 
of the many ethnic indian money dealers in the bazaar 
afghan government officials claim better planning a crackdown 
on hoarding and the governments success in defending major cities 
are the main reasons for the improved supply situation 
there were some mistakes by the government last winter of not 
reserving enough food government spokesman naquib sameer said 
now the people are sure the government is doing the best for 
them 
but this success story rests largely on two external factors 
the soviet union although it ended direct combat involvement 
last february after nine years still conducts a massive airlift of 
weapons and food to the government weather and mujahedeen rockets 
permitting 
mujahedeen leaders in neighboring pakistan where the most 
powerful guerrilla groups are based say theyve instructed their 
fighters to concentrate on military targets and stop attacking food 
convoys 
the kabul government also received help from the weather the 
198889 winter was the citys worst in memory when heavy snows 
closed the airport and the salang highway leading north to the 
soviet union this year the first snow didnt arrive in kabul until 
jan 17 
the mujahedeen who want to topple president najib and install 
an islamic government continue to attack the capital and other 
cities with weapons supplied by the united states saudi arabia and 
other moslem countries but they acknowledge that the level of 
fighting has declined since last years humiliating failure to 
capture jalalabad barely 37 miles from pakistan 
the mujahedeen had predicted they would take kabul within weeks 
or months after the soviet withdrawal an optimistic view also 
adopted by the us government 
but the guerrillas instead of uniting under a joint command 
fell victim to internal rivalries that periodically burst into open 
fighting some small guerrilla bands cut separate deals with 
najibs government and gave up the fight 
the mujahedeens top leaders insist theyll never negotiate with 
najib and his peoples democratic party of afghanistan which 
seized power by a military coup in 1978 
nobody can win this war said ahmad the taxi driver but 
now maybe the government and the mujahedeen learn this

gasoline lines have vanished across 
poland not because gas is plentiful but because few can afford to 
fill the tank anymore or to even take the car out of the garage 
polish drivers are being forced off the roads not only by the 
doubling of gasoline prices but also by steep increases in car 
registration fees highway taxes and insurance premiums 
all are part of the dramatic steps put into effect jan 1 as the 
new noncommunist government tries to create a freemarket system 
from polands beleagured economy 
in the southeastern city of lublin drivers have turned in the 
license plates for 13 percent of the registered cars according to 
a recent report on the television news 
the stateowned fuel monopoly says sales of gasoline dropped 
more than 20 percent during the first 20 days of 1990 compared 
with 1989 
taxi drivers sit in parked cabs unable to find passengers 
willing to pay the 100timesthemeter rate to cover the gas 
prices an estimated 60 percent of staterun enterprises arent 
using their fuel quotas because they cant pay the cost 
warsaws streets are noticeably less congested and gasoline 
trucks have been seen cruising the capital looking for service 
stations in need of a refill 
but poles are finding little pleasure in being able to drive in 
and fill up without waiting hours in line 
it was not good and it is not good said a doctor about to 
buy a tankful at a central warsaw gas station 
there is a saying what do you prefer to freeze to death 
outside your flat due to the low temperature or inside due to 
faulty heating both situations are wrong she said with a sigh 
gasoline now costs the zloty equivalent of 96 cents a gallon up 
from about 50 cents before jan 1 
that is cheap by west european standards but it is expensive 
for poles who on the average earn 560000 zlotys about 60 a 
month 
in addition a car owner now must pay 440000 zlotys a year for 
insurance and 49500 for highway taxes and registration 
the higher gas prices are part of the governments effort to 
stop paying producers huge subsidies to keep consumer prices 
artificially low 
that system left the economy with a staggering budget deficit 
unbridled inflation and little motivation for efficiency 
although drivers are disgruntled the reduced demand also may 
allow poland to cut its costly fuel imports 
gasoline supplies have long been a barometer of the polish 
economic crisis with filling the tank a major project that 
dominated drivers schedules and itineries 
car owners suffered through years of rationing and even after 
the coupon system ended jan 1 1989 supplies were frequently as 
short as the tempers on lines 
no more 
never have filling stations been as uncrowded said the 
weekly polityka warsaw has become a truly western capital by 
this standard you drive up and there is a smiling attendant 
waiting to fill your car 
at one warsaw gas station where it was not unusual to see a 
hundred drivers waiting at dawn the manager said the eight cars at 
the pumps at midday constituted a rush 
he said a tanker trucks gas delivery that he was able to sell 
in 10 hours now lasts two or three days 
attentants says customers drive in for as little as two liters 
a bit more than a halfgallon 
the notion of competing for customers is new in poland and the 
gas station manager clearly not ready to give away mugs or road 
maps rejected the idea of offering small extra services such as 
cleaning the windshield

elvis presley 42 is still dead but try to 
tell that to fans of the man who sang arias with such lyrics as 
you aint nothin but a hound dog theyll just boo you and 
maybe whomp you upside the head 
they have a very big treat coming up this week abcs elvis 
a halfhour series about the early scuffling part of his career 
the show is premiering tuesday then starts its regular run sunday 
created by rick husky and filmed in memphis tenn this elvis 
is played by michael st gerard he vaguely resembles presley 
alas he just doesnt seem as accomplished an actor 
but elvis fans will be hard pressed to find fault with the 
series which has three executive producers one of them the 
kings exwife priscilla and warns all that it is a 
dramatization of events in presleys life 
the shows tone is highly reverential much in the manner of a 
documentary about abraham lincoln or gandhi those expecting good 
ol boy humor are advised to rent a great burt reynolds flick 
ww and the dixie dancekings 
although slow and dull elvis is rife with indications that 
the polite sometimes sullenlooking young man in the sideburns is 
destined for greatness and might even become a major cultural force 
in america 
you can tell in one nightclub scene for example he sings 
money honey and sets everyone to dancing in sundays show a 
disc jockey plays elvis first record causing much of memphis to 
come down with happy feet 
the premiere opens with bluesy harmonica music heard as a car 
rolls past a mississippi cotton field this is because its against 
the law in tv to show a car rolling past a mississippi cotton field 
without bluesy harmonica music 
the car contains one sheriff and elvis father vernon billy 
green bush who does a fine lowkey job despite a bad script it 
is gently establshed that presley is seeing his wife and young son 
before being taken to prison 
its not clear why hes going to jail but he tells elvis who 
is 3 years old here that hes the man of the house now and to take 
care of his mother the lad seems to understand 
later scenes with vernon now out of prison but suffering back 
problems that force him to quit work include elvis historic visit 
to sun records in memphis to record a song for his mothers 
birthday 
it will be old news to elvis fans that the companys owner sam 
phillips jordan williams is mighty impressed with presleys 
voice no matter that here he tells the kid you got a raw sound 
elvis real raw 
maybe so but theres nothing even mildly raw in this show the 
only dramatic tension consists of elvis desire to do other than 
work at a wire warehouse and his fathers concern that elvis keep 
that job however grungy and lowpaying 
we all get chances elvis he says some of them we just 
cant take lifes that way sometimes it dont give you a 
choice 
ah but tv does and unless you want to see elvis presley 
canonized for the next eight weeks longer if abc renews the show 
itd be wise to pass on this series find a good book to curl up 
with and start curling 
 
elsewhere in television 
inspecting the hand that feeds it abcs good morning 
america today starts a fivepart series reported by cohost 
charles gibson on the billiondollar world of advertising and 
commercials in the united states wednesdays chapter might prove 
of particular interest its a look at how sex is used in hawking 
products

in the 1970s a decade of inflation people 
chased prices hoping to makes purchases before sales tags could be 
marked even higher 
by compressing the demand for goods by moving up future 
purchases into the present however such buyers did their bit to 
push prices even higher to some small degree they helped fulfill 
their fearful prophecy 
as the 1990s begin another chase might be developing this one 
involving home mortgage rates those rates had been falling now 
they are rising just as wouldbe homeowners prepare for the spring 
buying season 
during the past three or four months real estate agents in many 
parts of the country have observed that potential buyers were 
delaying purchases hoping to find lower mortgage rates 
now that rates are rising some of these buyers might feel 
compelled to act quickly to avoid even higher rates combined with 
the historical spring upturn in housing demand this could create 
stiffer borrowing terms 
so far there is little evidence that the scenario is happening 
but some housing people and mortgage lenders are suggesting the 
possibility 
so some reminders for those who might become involved 
1 the recent upward movement of home mortgage rates has indeed 
been sharp hsh associates which tracks rates nationally says the 
average of fixedrate loans recently was 1012 percent up 
onequarter of a percent in two weeks 
moreover news has developed recently to douse hopes of any 
cuts perhaps most significant was the the statement by alan 
greenspan federal reserve board chairman that he foresees slow 
expansion rather than recession 
2 there is very little evidence however that recent increases 
are part of a longterm trend many bankers and financial analysts 
still believe that rates will resume falling this year especially 
as the economy weakens 
3 still few people can forget the devastation wrought by those 
15 percentplus prime rates in the 1970s they fear that such a 
situation could develop again putting them out of the housing 
market for years 
the climate of the 1990s however is much different from those 
days 
in the 1970s and early 1980s there were fundamental fears that 
the economy had gone crazy prices soared and so did debt some 
small businesses actually paid 25 percent to borrow money in 1981 
still some were turned away 
viewing that scene and the trend lenders feared that the future 
could only be worse the rate the cost to uncle sam on 30year 
government bonds hit doubledigit levels 136 per cent in 1981 
for the first time in memory 
but rates began backing down again in 1985 near the end of 
last year that same 30year bond was under 8 percent indicating a 
return of confidence in the future that same observation applies 
also to lenders on 30year mortgages 
the recent rise which brought the 30year bond above 85 
percent is only a few weeks old and cannot be used to suggest a 
sustained loss of faith in the future if it persists yes but it 
could come back down suddenly too 
it adds up to this advice for those who intend someday to buy a 
home 
dont be panicked into believing that interest rates only go up 
they come down too sometimes when least expected in the 1970s 
some alleged authorities said we would never again see singledigit 
mortgage rates we have 
the lesson is this reconsider before chasing prices or interest 
rates higher because there may be little to be gained it might be 
smarter to sit back and relax and let prices and rates come to you

lights camera hype 
its time for the obligatory opening night press conference and 
the room is jammed with journalists and others lucky enough to get 
in for a glimpse of the shows stars 
but wait this isnt the movies this is the theater and 
serious theater at that 
the show is cat on a hot tin roof tennessee williams 
pulitzer prizewinning drama the ticket is movie star kathleen 
turner making her debut as williams sultry maggie a role 
originated by barbara bel geddes on stage and later by elizabeth 
taylor on screen 
the hype is inevitable the producers say 
she really spells glamour explained fran weissler who is 
producing the broadwaybound play with her husband barry weissler 
shes a real movie star and that excites people 
the excitement is such that 52 reporters and photographers 
descended on pittsburghs benedum center for the jan 23 press 
conference some from out of state 
the tall blond actress whose film credits include body 
heat romancing the stone prizzis honor the 
accidental tourist and the war of the roses seized center 
stage as soon as she sat down next to costars charles durning 
daniel hugh kelly and polly holliday 
she was in perpetual motion flinging her hair over her 
shoulders lounging back in her chair and leaning toward durning 
and kelly losing her shoes under the table taking her wirerimmed 
glasses off and on 
most of the questions were for turner who said she always had 
longed for the part when the questions werent she would 
interrupt her costars during their responses and chat with the 
actors beside her while one of the others spoke 
turner was visibly pleased when a reporter asked if she agrees 
with the publics assessment of her as a fantasy figure 
im a fantasy figure ahhh she said breathing heavily and 
twisting seductively in her chair do you agree with that mr 
durning let someone else answer that 
nah come on its acting guys it really truly really is 
its fun to be able to play these women with all this wonderful 
power and allure and intelligence id like to add but its 
acting its just fun im really not like that at home 
what is she like at home 
none of your business she replied thats private 
as soon as the news conference ended many in the crowd surged 
forward for autographs the actress obliged for a few moments then 
was whisked away for rehearsal no private interviews no 
pestering please 
welcome to broadway way offbroadway hollywoodstyle 
its tough the more advance you have the luckier you are as 
a producer fran weissler said 
a big name star usually facilitates financing a play which can 
run into several million dollars said harvey sabinson executive 
director of the league of american theaters and producers 
cat on a hot tin roof is due to open at broadways eugene 
oneill theater on march 21 after runs in wilmington del 
pittsburgh boston and philadelphia turner is committed to the 
show until midjuly 
the weisslers said the actress was their no 1 choice because 
and only because shes perfect for the part 
i would say that show could run as long as shes committed 
sabinson said there were two reasons for hiring kathleen turner 
one shes a fine actress and two shes a big name too 
turner is by no means the first major motion picture star to 
play the great white way 
katharine hepburn worked both sides jack lemmon has been on 
broadway lots of hollywood stars have since the breakdown of the 
studio system years ago where actors werent tied up for life to a 
studio sabinson said 
most of your big stars started on broadway spencer tracy 
clark gable they all started on broadway they like to work before 
live audiences 
thats one reason why turner is back on stage the 35yearold 
actress had a tiny role in one of the replacement casts for the 
longrunning broadway production of gemini in 1978 
the immediate response one garners on stage the communal 
feeling as an audience comes together in this experience is so 
supportive its so exciting turner said i really feel there 
are moments when you start reading thoughts back and forth its 
just wonderful 
i dont prefer either film or stage i want both 
even with the medias bright spotlight big names on the marquee 
dont necessarily assure a long run 
ticket sales for 3 penny opera with rock star sting as mack 
the knife failed to meet expectations for instance and the show 
closed dec 31 after two months on broadway shakespeares the 
merchant of venice starring dustin hoffman on the other hand is 
scheduled to close march 10 when the ensemble disbands after a 
virtually soldout threemonth run 
the best combination is a great star in a great production of a 
good play 
the play is always the thing sabinson said just like 
shakespeare wrote

garage mechanics listen for pings piano 
tuners are alert for plunks donald e marlowes job is to wait for 
the next pow to shatter the silence of his laboratory 
marlowe is the governments chief condom tester and the 
explosions come from an air burst test he is perfecting to 
measure sample condoms resistance to pressure 
working in a low nondescript building that the food and drug 
administration shares with a furniture store in this washington 
suburb marlowe demonstrates by slipping a latex condom onto a 
machine equipped with gauges dials and the squiggly needle of an 
instrument that looks like a seismograph 
then he inflates the condom with air it swells to the size of a 
goodsized watermelon before it bursts the instruments record that 
it withstood 30 liters or about 7 gallons of air and pressure of 
threetenths of a pound per square inch well above the 
governments exacting standard 
pretty tough says marlowe a 49yearold mechanical 
engineer who runs the division of mechanics and material science 
for the fdas center for devices and radiological health 
in another room marlowe takes a circular section cut from the 
middle of a condom similar to a wide rubber band and stretches it 
on a machine to test its tensile strength how far it will stretch 
before it snaps 
besides condoms marlowes laboratory tests a wide variety of 
medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers artificial hearts and 
valves false eyes syringes pumps and bone joint and ligament 
implants 
nearly four dozen of these prosthetic body parts are attached to 
yorick the fdas bionic skeleton which greets visitors to the 
laboratory where all the devices have been tested over the years 
the fda is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of 
medical devices and condoms are a medical device marlowe said 
marlowe is accustomed to the snickers and jokes he sometimes 
hears about condoms he chuckles indulgently about the time his 
staff in a playful holiday mood inflated some condoms with helium 
and tied them to the office christmas tree they looked great 
he said 
but marlowe says that with widespread public concern over the 
aids epidemic and former surgeon general c everett koops highly 
publicized campaign to promote safer sex condoms are no laughing 
matter 
since the early 1960s fda agents at a winchester mass 
laboratory north of boston have been conducting random unannounced 
tests of sample condoms from domestic and foreign manufacturers for 
possible water leakage 
during the year ended in april 1988 the fda tested 115000 
condoms for possible pinholes or tears in this way resulting in 
rejection of more than 30 million imported condoms as defective and 
the recall of 3 million domestic condoms from store shelves 
marlowe said his laboratorys air burst and tensile strength 
tests for condoms form the basis for an industrywide testing 
standard that was first published in 1973 and was revised most 
recently in november 
that standard is recognized voluntarily by manufacturers the 
government and consumer interests including the us agency for 
international development which supplies condoms for third world 
population control projects compliance is determined during the 
fdas regular quality assurance inspections of manufacturers 
someone new coming into the lab gets over the bathroom humor 
about condoms very quickly marlowe said this is serious 
business

japanesegerman relations once a mighty 
military threat vanquished by america nearly a halfcentury ago 
have come back to haunt the us financial markets this time the 
weapon is plenty of money 
investors from japan the largest single source of foreign 
capital to the united states are shifting their sights to 
attractive european markets namely booming west germany which is 
emerging as the most powerful economic force reshaping eastern 
europe 
the thought that the enormously wealthy japanese may be hanging 
back from us investments dampened the stock markets mood this 
past week and injected new anxiety into the market for treasury 
securities 
an impending 30 billion treasury auction this week could 
provide a better clue about the extent to which japanese investors 
are willing to keep financing americas federal deficit economists 
say 
poor participation would suggest that interest rates must rise 
to attract buyers this would make bonds more competitive with 
stocks and would raise borrowing costs of american corporations 
lowering their profits 
for weeks japanese investors have been lightening up on american 
equities partly to raise cash for margin calls on their own 
heavily leveraged stocks at home economists say japanese stocks 
have been falling mainly in response to rising interest rates and 
inflation pressures 
more significantly japanese investors have discovered 
potentially more lucrative markets in west germany since the berlin 
wall came tumbling down 
the japanese have taken money otherwise going to buy us 
stocks and bonds and are investing in west germany said 
economist mark killion with drimcgrawhill inc in lexington mass 
west germany is particularly attractive to japanese investors 
for two reasons exchange rates the mark is stronger against both 
the dollar and the yen and political changes in eastern europe 
which are expected to enormously benefit the west german economy 
both are pushing up west german interest rates 
the highest rates of return available today are in germany 
said marc m goloven an international economist with manufacturers 
hanover trust co 
in the week ending jan 26 the longterm west german government 
bond yielded 756 percent goloven said the comparable japanese 
yield was 619 percent although the us treasurys longterm bond 
was yielding 848 percent the rising value of the mark still made 
the west german bonds worth more 
higher west german rates stem partly from the influx of people 
into west germany from throughout eastern europe which is putting 
pressure on prices particularly housing and raising the inflation 
rate the west german central banks answer to rising inflation is 
to raise interest rates 
in addition unification of western europe markets under the 
european economic community in 1992 has incited a rush of 
investments by the japanese who fear that heightened trade 
restrictions could keep them out 
theres a lot of incentive for japanese investors to get into 
europe now before the barriers come crashing down killion said 
the feeling in japan is that investors will have a much better 
prospect for working successfully in european markets if they get 
there before 1992 occurs 
nonetheless economists emphasize that japanese investors while 
investing in europe are not abandoning us markets 
the question is not whether japanese investors are going to 
come to the united states but at what price said lawrence a 
veit international economist with brown brothers harriman amp co 
veit says european markets are not large enough to absorb huge 
amounts of japanese money 
so whereas the japanese can send a lot of money in a short 
time to europe it is not feasible to think that they will send a 
lot of money over a long period of time veit said 
economists say there are still many reasons the japanese will 
come to us markets including political stability 
we still attract significant amounts of japanese investment 
capital and will continue to do so whether in the form of direct 
investment in such things as automobile assembly plants or 
portfolio investments in stocks and bonds goloven said

hattie dudley has a list 
it started taking shape oct 24 the day after charles stuart 
unleashed the lie that his wife carol was killed by a black man 
outside a mission hill housing project that was the day hattie 
dudley saw a young hispanic man on the street stopped stripped and 
searched by police looking for suspects in the death of the 
30yearold and white pregnant lawyer 
she did not know who the young hispanic man was but the next 
time she took names 
ms dudley who raised her seven children in the mission hill 
project she now runs collected the names and stories of six young 
people subjected to police searches in the hunt for a phantom 
murderer she and other residents say there were many more 
they felt they were all accused murderers she said of the 
young men among the 3000 mostly black and hispanic residents of 
the mission hill projects 
her list even includes a young woman detained in a police car 
for 20 minutes until a female officer arrived to don rubber gloves 
and inspect the womans private parts ms dudley says she doesnt 
say the search was directly related to the stuart case but it 
illustrates for her the liberties authorities took 
police do not discount such stories outright but say no one has 
come forward to complain of police conduct in the mission hill 
search 
martha knight might have come forward but her son cannot 
identify those who searched him he was standing at an intersection 
with a girlfriend when police surrounded him on all sides they 
made him pull down his trousers and then his underwear and shined a 
flashlight on his buttocks she said then they let him go 
it makes you angry said ms knight it makes you feel 
less than human and who do you complain to 
officers combed mission hill with the description of a black man 
existing only in stuarts imagination 28 to 34 years old about 
5foot10 weighing 150 to 160 pounds with a raspy voice a short 
afro and splotchy facial hair 
police spokesman jim jordan said basic homicide investigation 
procedures were followed in the search for suspects and 
authorities point to a longstanding policy of investigating 
civilian charges of misconduct 
but ms knight and others say they dont know where to turn 
they are distrustful of the police to begin with an apprehension 
reinforced in recent months by a citywide drug crackdown before 
the stuart shootings in which suspected dealers were stopped and 
searched on the streets 
after stuart himself was implicated in his wifes death and 
jumped to his death from a bridge jan 4 the outrage burst forth 
in angry collective protests many leaders of the minority 
community now faulted the police for their readiness to accept a 
stereotypical suspect police countered that no one doubted stuart 
in the early weeks and that they would have been derelict not to 
have based the search on his description 
police installed a 24hour complaint hotline and the state 
attorney general is looking at both the stopandsearch tactic and 
the manner in which individuals were questioned in the stuart case 
but deputy superintendent arthur morgan jr who heads the 
police internal affairs office said he still knows of no 
unjustified searches 
i need someone to come up and tell me theyve been stopped 
illegally and searched illegally and point out the policeman who 
did it morgan said 
hattie dudley is keeping her list to herself she doesnt trust 
government investigators she said 
all during the civil rights movement there was the fbi and 
the justice department investigators she said and all we got 
from them was a dead leader martin martin luther king 
in the days after the stuart shootings many mission hill 
residents were as eager as others throughout the city to see a 
suspect caught 
the man who did it should be taken out anthony stanley 23 
said two days after the incident we got to get the death penalty 
back the guy was foul he had no heart 
but then they watched day after day until several weeks later 
when the investigation focused on a suspect in custody for another 
crime as young men were stopped on the streets told to lean 
spreadeagled against police cars and searched 
it was just crazy times something you see in the movies 
said ms knight a community organizer even though there were 
more police we didnt feel more protected 
it makes you think that they can come in just because of where 
we live im sure they couldnt go to beacon hill or some other 
middleclass neighborhood and do the same thing 
hector mercado said he was stopped and patted down three or four 
times 
it was like a war zone a lot of cars a lot of police going 
inside of hallways checking day and night said mercado 19 who 
is studying for his high school equivalency diploma i feel badly 
because they didnt have no right 
for one of the searches mercado was stopped on his way home 
after escorting his wife madelyn to her parents apartment he 
was walking along the street minding his own business he said 
when three officers ordered him to halt 
one of them held his hand on his gun mercado recalled 
they said stop and get behind the car 
one officer warned him i dont want to see you around here 
around where mercado now asks mission hill is his home it 
might not be the best place in the world but it is home 
we were a people full of dignity there was a real sense of 
community and belonging and comfort ms dudley said you know 
when youre home that relaxed feeling 
for now she said thats gone

usually take a break from shopping after christmas and some people 
enter the new year with credit card debts that discourage them from 
shopping for a while 
widespread price cutting and other promotions this past holiday 
season particularly by debtladen department stores desperate to 
raise cash may have left buyers more bloated than usual 
jeffrey edelman of drexel burnham lambert inc said the 
retailers with the leanest inventories due to good holiday business 
generally had the smallest january sales growth the stores that 
were stuck with excess after christmas and succeeded in pushing 
merchandise out to make room for fresh spring lines reported higher 
sales results 
edelman estimated that sales at general merchandise apparel and 
furniture retailers rose 5 percent in january from the prior year 
the change covered sales at stores open a year or longer known as 
same or comparablestore sales analysts and store executives 
consider samestore tallies the best indicator of a retailers 
health 
jeffrey feiner a merrill lynch amp co analyst said recent 
slippage in consumer confidence reflecting uncertainty about 
economic conditions and jittery financial markets portends 
possibly rougher times for retailers 
weakness in both the housing and financial markets makes the 
outlook for consumer spending in retail stores likely to be 
quite sluggish at least over the near term feiner said 
the conference boards monthly consumer confidence index 
released wednesday showed further erosion in january for the third 
month in a row the business research group said the index sank to 
the lowest point since just after the october 1987 stock market 
crash

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden wants to pack more punch when his agency goes 
after financial fraud and securities law violators 
breeden told a senate panel thursday that policing wall street 
would be easier if the sec had access to grand jury testimony in 
criminal probes and authority to fine securities law violators 
breeden also said he supported proposed legislation that would 
disqualify major securities law violators from serving as officers 
or directors of publicly held companies 
but that authority should be in the hands of federal judges 
not the sec he said 
breeden said the sec should be able to tell repeat federal 
securities offenders such as fugitive financier robert vesco 
your conduct is so severe that youre not going to get another 
opportunity to do it again 
the sec chief was the first witness at a hearing before the 
senate banking committees securities subcommittee which is 
considering many of the reforms he proposed 
the proposed securities law enforcement remedies act was 
introduced last year at the secs request by sen christopher j 
dodd dconn the subcommittee chairman and sen john heinz of 
pennsylvania the ranking republican 
other witnesses included two former heads of the secs key 
enforcement division gary g lynch and stanley sporkin and a 
former sec commissioner aulana l peters 
nearly all favored the proposed reforms 
but the american society of corporate secretaries which 
supports the bills objectives considers the language much too 
broad said victor futter a board member for the nationwide 
group of top executives 
futter told the panel that barring violators from holding 
corporate office amounts to an economic death penalty and that 
the fine provisions did not require proof of criminal conduct or 
fraud 
sporkin now a federal judge in washington also expressed doubt 
about the proposal to bar violators from future corporate offices 
not everybody should be barred for life he said even 
pete rose has said he wants to come back to major league baseball 
lynch who was enforcement director from 1985 to 1989 cautioned 
that the ability to fine violators should only be exercised in 
cases involving deliberate fraud or manipulation 
breeden asked for the power to fine securitieslaw violators 
either directly through sec administrative proceedings or through 
civil court actions 
currently the sec can seek fines only in insidertrading cases 
unlike most federal financial regulators including the commodity 
futures trading commission which oversees the futures industry 
and the office of thrift supervision the savings and loan watchdog 
the sec fines would range from a top maximum of 100000 for an 
individual to 500000 for a company or other entity 
breeden also asked congress to give the sec access to grand jury 
testimony in criminal securities investigations he noted that sec 
lawyers often work side by side with the justice department in 
criminal investigations such as the ivan boesky insidetrading case 
but under current law the sec may not be given access to secret 
grand jury testimony even when the information was developed by 
our own personnel without a court ruling that it is necessary 
for a judicial proceeding breeden said he added that the sec 
cant get a look at criminal grand jury proceedings without such 
court approval even after the criminal process is completed 
breeden also requested cease and desist authority that would 
allow the sec to halt suspected illegal activities 
currently the sec must go to the overworked federal court 
system and get a court order to halt alleged wrongdoings that 
could delay the agency from halting an alleged penny stock fraud if 
it uncovers a boiler room operation with banks of fasttalking 
sales people pressuring investors with getrichquick schemes said 
breeden 
neither the cease and desist power nor the access to grand jury 
testimony was included in the original bill introduced last year

john j phelan jr has charted the new york 
stock exchange through a period of explosive growth and 
neardisaster but he will leave the nations largest trading forum 
with critical issues unresolved 
phelan announced thursday he would retire at the end of 1990 to 
pursue a new but undetermined career 42 years after he worked for 
his father one summer as a runner on the stock exchange floor 
and hated it 
phelans cool leadership helped the exchange recover from the 
cataclysmic crash of oct 19 1987 when the largest selloff in 
history wiped 508 points off the dow jones industrial average 
he also championed new technology that enabled the market to 
cope with record volume during the crash implemented controversial 
reforms designed to limit computerized trading and sought to assure 
small investors they could get a fair shake in a market dominated 
by professionals 
at a news conference thursday phelan said key issues such as 
volatility in stock prices and the nyses relationship with the 
nations futures and options exchanges may have to be left to his 
successsor 
but phelan said he felt he was stepping down at a time when the 
exchange was healthy and he had sufficiently addressed the crash 
and its aftermath 
markets and the exchange are the kinds of institutions where 
you cannot press a button and resolve them overnight he said 
because of the enormity of the constituent groups the problems 
are resolved over a period of time by constant dialogue and changes 
and negotiation 
phelan declined to specify what he might do next though he said 
he might seek to combine philanthropy education and business a 
successor was expected to be named by the fall 
phelan quashed rumors he might replace treasury secretary 
nicholas brady who worked with him analyzing the crash phelan 
said he had not been contacted about a government job and was not 
considering one 
wall street reacted with some surprise to phelans announcement 
and praised his foresight in installing the technology that helped 
the exchange survive the 1987 crash and a minicrash last oct 13 
its been battered and bruised and yet its stronger than 
ever said securities industry association chairman robert n 
downey a partner at goldman sachs amp co if phelan hadnt been 
out front pushing for the computerization it never could have 
handled the volume 
under phelan the value of all stocks listed on the big board 
as the exchange is commonly known has grown from 16 trillion to 
more than 27 trillion making it the worlds secondlargest 
exchange behind tokyo 
volume on the exchange has grown from 186 million shares a day 
when phelan became vice chairman in 1975 to about 170 million in 
1989 more than 600 million shares changed hands on black monday in 
1987 
a onetime specialist managing trading activity on the floor 
phelan was vice chairman for five years and president for four more 
before being named chairman and chief executive in 1984 
phelan had said previously he didnt plan to be chairman for 
life but he had been expected to remain at least until 1992 the 
200th anniversary of the stock markets founding by two dozen 
traders gathered under a buttonwood tree on wall street 
i think hes been marvelous said alan c ace greenberg 
chairman of the investment firm bear stearns amp co he came from 
the floor he understands the business it helped 
weve seen everything from electronic trading pressures to the 
market crash to new products and innovations to congressional 
pressure added wall street veteran jack barbanel president of 
first global asset management inc i think he has done a very 
superb job addressing most of the issues 
the most contentious topic lately is the price zigzags that have 
characterized some trading days especially last oct 13 when the 
dow jones lost 190 points some traders blame volatility on program 
trading a practice in which millions of dollars worth of stocks 
are traded instantaneously by computers 
phelan has been reluctant to restrict program trading although 
he has limited it during heavy price fluctuations last fall he 
commissioned a panel to study volatility and the role of program 
trading 
phelan worked for his fathers securities firm while at adelphi 
university on long island he served with the marines in korea 
before returning to the exchange floor of his vacation job working 
for his father at age 16 he said 
at the end of the summer when i was finished the job he said 
well how did you enjoy wall street and i said ill tell you 
one thing i dont know what im going to do in life but im 
certainly not going to work on wall street

chrysler corp will shut down its car assembly 
plant in st louis and lay off 3700 workers in a move thats 
likely to worsen already souring relations between the company and 
its union 
thursdays announcement the latest in a series of moves by us 
automakers to cut capacity in the face of slumping sales makes it 
likely that job security will be the unions top priority when it 
opens contract negotiations with the nations big three automakers 
this summer 
chrysler said its st louis no 1 plant will close sept 21 one 
week after its existing contract with the united auto workers 
expires as previously announced chrysler will eliminate one shift 
at the plant on feb 12 
the company said it will transfer production of the dodge 
daytona to its sterling heights mich assembly plant and shift 
assembly of the chrysler lebaron coupe and convertible to its 
newark del plant 
the st louis plant will be the third chrysler has closed since 
late 1988 it was announced just one day before the company closes 
a detroit plant and puts 1700 other workers on indefinite layoff 
the move angered united auto workers officials 
workers and their unions dont design the cars or develop the 
marketing plans uaw president owen bieber and vice president 
stan marshall head of the unions chrysler department said in a 
statement 
senior management calls those shots but when they 
miscalculate or screw up they all stay in place while the workers 
are told to hit the street they said 
chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said the timing of the st louis 
plant closing was dictated by the uaw contract which expires sept 
14 
that pact doesnt allow the company to close a plant because of 
product transfers it says plants may be shut down only if sales of 
its products slump badly 
chrysler used that as justification for todays closing of its 
jefferson avenue assembly plant in detroit that factory makes 
dodge omni and plymouth horizon subcompact cars whose sales have 
fallen by more than 50 percent from their heyday of about 208000 
in 1986 
the uaw has contested that closing saying chrysler didnt do 
enough to keep the design of the small cars fresh and market them 
properly 
some of the 1700 workers laid off from jefferson avenue will be 
offered jobs at jefferson north a plant under construction next to 
the existing factory that plant will begin producing a 
sportutility vehicle in late 1992 
chrysler is shutting the st louis plant in two stages 
beginning feb 12 it will eliminate one shift putting 1900 of 
its 3700 workers on indefinite layoff in september it will lay 
off the remaining 1800 workers and close the plant 
the announcement couldnt have come at a worst moment said 
harley shaiken a labor professor at the university of california 
at san diego 
i think this coming on top of jefferson is going to create a 
lot of anxiety and hostility in the industry going into 
negotiations he said 
the uaw opens talks with general motors corp ford motor co 
and chrysler in july uaw president owen bieber said negotiating 
priorities will be worked out at a special union convention in may 
in kansas city mo but job security was more than likely to be 
the top issue 
michigan state university labor professor dale brickner agreed 
job security is going to be the barn burner brickner said 
if we had strikes this fall one or more it certainly would not 
surprise me 
nicoll the chrysler spokesman said the delaware and michigan 
plants would be idled in november to retool for the new cars and 
would resume production in december 
employment at each plant will increase by a few hundred workers 
with laid off st louis workers getting the first cracks at the new 
jobs 
the st louis closing is one in a series of temporary or 
indefinite shutdowns or production cuts at big three assembly 
plants nationwide about 15400 workers will have lost their jobs 
at 11 gm or chrysler assembly plants because of indefinite layoffs 
between january and september 
this isnt the last shaiken said i think we will see 
something else at gm particularly as contract time approaches 
the closures come as auto sales slump and capacity at 
japaneseowned plants grows within the last year honda motor co 
ltd has opened a second assembly plant in ohio and nissan motor 
corp has announced a huge expansion of its factory in smyrna tenn 
since 1986 the best year in automotive sales history gm and 
chrysler have lost market share while ford and japanese companies 
with the help of their new us plants have increased their shares

workers at chrysler corps no 1 plant in 
suburban fenton have worked only two weeks since midoctober so 
they werent too surprised by the announcement that the plant will 
be closed permanently in september 
in the back of my mind i kind of thought this was going to 
happen said dennis moser of festus who has been at plant no 1 
for 24 years 
i thought they were leading up to something and i knew they 
would have an announcement but i thought it would be in march 
ed boyer president of united auto workers local 136 was 
disappointed and frustrated at thursdays news 
i dont know what the next steps going to be right now 
boyer said weve got to get some answers to some very important 
questions that we dont have right now 
national union leaders in detroit said they didnt understand 
why the st louis workers have to be the sacrificial victims of 
difficulties in the market 
in a joint statement uaw president owen bieber and vice 
president stan marshall said workers and their unions dont 
design the cars or develop the marketing plans 
the nations no 3 automaker said it will close the st louis 
no 1 plant sept 21 and transfer production of the dodge daytona 
and chrysler lebaron to factories in newark del and sterling 
heights mich 
no work has been done at the plant since dec 18 
plant no 1 a 25 million squarefeet facility capable of 
producing 225000 cars a year has been in operation more than 30 
years the first car a fourdoor plymouth belvedere rolled off 
the assembly line on oct 20 1959 
chrysler also operates a neighboring facility in fenton plant 
no 2 which makes minivans none of the estimated 3500 jobs 
there were affected by the announcement 
to prepare for the permanent shutdown chrysler will cut 
production at plant no 1 to one shift feb 12 by september all 
3700 employees will be laid off although they will have first 
chance at several hundred new jobs to be created at the delaware 
and michigan plants 
id have to go although id go kicking and screaming for 
sure said moser who is less than six years away from qualifying 
for full retirement ive got a whole section of my life tied up 
with the chrysler corporation and i dont know if theyve given 
anything back 
moser and other auto workers are blaming the layoff on 
chryslers strategy of shifting production to mexico where labor 
costs are much cheaper 
anywhere they can squeeze a penny theyll squeeze it said 
autoworker rich bolzenius of union a rear window molding fitter 
who has been with chrysler for 13 years theyre always trying to 
make the worker look like the bad guy because hes not a team 
player 
but the reality of it is the team concept is just a company 
concept that the workers follow to make it better for the company

gillette co already an importer of razor blades 
into the soviet union hopes to set up its first manufacturing 
plant there in a few years 
gillette said thursday it had signed a memorandum of intent with 
the leninets group based in leningrad to establish a 50 million 
blademaking facility 
leninets employs some 40000 people in the manufacture and sale 
of consumer products as well as scientific ecological and 
research activities 
i think that the leninets and gillette joint experience will 
help solve the supply problem in our market with such vital 
products and leningraders will be among the first to have access to 
these goods anatoliy turchak directorgeneral of leninets said 
in a statement 
gillette is trying to find an existing facility in the soviet 
union that can be transformed into a plant that could produce 800 
million blades a year company spokesman david fausch said that 
would make the plant the fourth largest blade facility in the world 
for gillette he said 
gillette the world leader in the razor market would hold a 
majority stake in the plant 
the company hopes to sign a definitive agreement for the project 
later this year the project could be completed within 20 months of 
an agreement fausch said 
under the deal blades would be made using gillette technology 
but the brand name of the products has not been decided fausch 
said 
fausch noted that gillette has been importing blades into the 
soviet union for the past few years from a plant in india

utilities supplying federated and allied 
department stores say theyre disappointed but not surprised by a 
bankruptcy judges refusal of requests for deposits totaling up to 
20 million 
its about what we expected john ducker a lawyer for puget 
sound power amp light co said thursday after us bankruptcy judge 
j vincent aug jr refused to order the campeau corp retailers to 
post guarantees 
aug said if the retailers financial condition deteriorates he 
would require a onemonth utility deposit but he said the 596 
utilities serving federated and allied businesses nationwide 
havent shown the companies wont have the cash to pay bills on 
time 
also thursday bankruptcy court trustee conrad j morgenstern 
announced the formation of committees of unsecured creditors for 
federated and allied the committees include representatives from 
liz claiborne inc and sony corp of america among others 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp filed 
jan 15 for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy act listing 75 billion in debts 
cory lipoff a lawyer for federated and allied said utilities 
demanded deposits equal to two months bills 
we are confident that we can make our payments lipoff said 
with few exceptions the debtors are current with all their 
bills 
aug advised utilities to sit tight until feb 14 when he 
will hold a hearing on whether to approve 700 million in bank 
credits to keep the store groups operating during reorganization 
we do have companies that have cash piling up that dont 
have to tap their working capital if their creditors dont panic 
the judge said 
but leon mener a lawyer for consolidated edison co of new 
york said he was worried that federated and allied would run out 
of money before they emerge from bankruptcy court protection 
were worried about those final bills at the end of the 
proceeding when were going to get stuck like we got stuck 
before mener said he said he thought the two chains could match 
the twomonth deposit another retailer lj hooker corp paid after 
filing for protection from creditors 
ducker disputed lipoffs argument that the retailers have enough 
assets readily convertible to cash to qualify for normal treatment 
by their utilities 
under questioning by ducker federated and allied vice president 
and treasurer mark kennedy said he didnt know whether the company 
has any assets or inventory that arent pledged as security for 
past debts or the 700 million in credits 
im sure there would be one asset unencumbered kennedy 
said i think my desk is free and clear 
aug also approved a request by federated and allied to renew a 
300000ayear contract with the recruiter who is searching for a 
chairman and chief executive officer to replace john w burden iii 
who retired wednesday aug approved resumption of severance pay and 
about 20000 in monthly retirement benefits that had been 
suspended 
meanwhile federated said efforts to sell bloomingdales 
considered by many as the groups most attractive department store 
chain have been delayed and may be called off 
its a decision that should be made only after the creditors 
committee have a chance to review an analysis of whether there 
would be more value for federated by retaining bloomingdales or 
by selling it federated spokeswoman carol sanger said

drexel burnham lambert inc agreed to pay the 
state 1 million in a settlement the latest agreement stemming 
from the wall street firms guilty plea to securities fraud charges 
massachusetts became the 41st state to reach such an agreement 
with drexel the settlement announced thursday was the largest ever 
paid to the state in a securities matter according to secretary of 
state michael j connolly 
drexel pleaded guilty in us district court in new york last 
september to six felonies and paid 650 million to settle a range 
of fraud allegations stemming from the governments lengthy 
investigation of insider trading on wall street 
drexel also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and 
unprecedented federal supervision in settling civil charges with 
the securities and exchange commission 
under the settlement drexel paid 300 million in fines to the 
government and set aside 350 million for investors who can prove 
they were harmed by the firms actions those who may be entitled 
to restitution include people who bought stocks in about 20 
allegedly fraudulent transactions cited by the sec 
the settlement with massachusetts is one of the largest the firm 
reached with states that have settled so far drexel paid illinois 
about 12 million the lowest settlements were about 50000 said 
a company spokesman 
the settlement with massachusetts brings the total amount drexel 
has paid states to 83 million 
were pleased we were able to settle it and now we can go 
about our business said steven anreder a drexel spokesman 
the 1 million settlement will go into the states general fund 
connolly said 
drexel originally offered massachusetts 275000 connolly said 
but the state held out for more 
their record settlement makes clear massachusetts firm 
commitment to enforce the law and combat fraud connolly said 
adding lower amount was simply not adequate compensation 
settling with the states relieves the firm of possible 
litigation and frees state regulators from having to investigate 
the firms trading activities from 1984 to 1986 when the sec 
alleged the fraud occurred 
it also generally preserves the firms ability to underwrite 
securities and do other business in the states most states can 
revoke a companys right to do business if the firm is convicted or 
admits to committing a felony drexel abandoned the retail 
brokerage business last year 
in massachusetts the agreement includes a stipulation that 
drexel must not solicit any new retail trade without first 
notifying the state securities division and demonstrating 
compliance procedures are in place 
the firm also cannot sponsor private placements to individuals 
and must work with the securities division to identify any state 
investors injured by the illegal sale of drexel junk bonds victims 
would be entitled to place claims with the 350 million 
compensation fund drexel established 
in addition drexel must hire an independent consultant to 
scrutinize company policies and submit compliance reports hire an 
ombudsman to receive and investigate complaints finance annual 
audits by the state securities division and establish an oversight 
committee to review its internal procedures 
connolly said he did not know whether any massachusetts 
residents were hurt by drexel sales

hilton hotels corp has hung out a 
do not disturb sign for the moment deciding to pass up buyout 
offers for now while trying to negotiate a better deal or come up 
with a restructuring plan 
the lodgingcasino concern which put itself up for sale last 
summer said its directors met tuesday and wednesday to consider 
bids and restructuring proposals the board adjourned without 
taking definitive action hilton said thursday 
its stock which had traded as high as 11550 a share last 
august tumbled 325 to 5850 on the new york stock exchange 
hilton said its board instructed its financial advisers and 
management to further develop the acquisition proposals and the 
alternate strategies and to report back to the board on these 
matter within the next several weeks 
hilton has effectively been up for sale since settlement of a 
dispute over the estate of founder conrad hilton last may the 
company formally invited offers in august for all or part of its 
lodging and casino operations 
at the time analysts estimated the 48 million shares of hilton 
common stock might fetch 120 a share or more hilton general 
counsel william c lebo said expressions of interest had come in 
from buyers worldwide particulary in asia 
since then the atmosphere for deals particularly those 
involving real estate has soured 
real estate prices softened the pilots bid for ual corp fell 
apart because of inadequate bank financing campeau corp made 
bankruptcy filings due to heavy debt and the junk bond market a 
major source of takeover financing went into a tailspin 
the offers for hilton came in far lower than expected with 
apparently no bids from japanese buyers despite strong previous 
interest from the japanese in such trophy buildings as hiltons 
waldorf astoria 
the wall street journal reported in late december bids were in 
the 90 a share range causing the stock price to plunge it fell 
further on rumors that bids from chicagos jmb realty corp and 
others had been lowered or withdrawn 
in addition to a sale one option available to hilton would be a 
recapitalization in which the company would borrow in order to pay 
a big dividend to shareholders 
michael mueller of montgomery securities in san francisco one 
of the analysts who had predicted a 120ashare price for hilton 
last summer said thursday he believed an outright sale of the 
company still would bring shareholders about 80 to 85 a share 
he said hiltons statement was a positive sign for shareholders 
to the extent it indicated a deal might still be made 
it appears the acquisition offers they have received so far 
are below what the board would like or the terms are unacceptable 
but that negotiations could still produce an acceptable deal he 
said 
the company closed its twoparagraph statement by stressing 
again that it could give no assurances that the directors would 
sell restructure or recapitalize the company at all

fans and foes of a plan to cut social security 
taxes are wooing the american association of retired persons in 
hopes of enlisting the clout and credibility of nations largest 
senior citizen group 
budget director richard g darman an ardent opponent of the tax 
cut on thursday appealed to the aarps legislative council to 
draw upon the enormous respect that you command that we do not 
command to fight the proposal 
darmans ally social security commissioner gwendolyn king 
later told the group im not going to press you but i do want 
you to know how important it is that you not leave me out here by 
myself that you not cop out of this debate 
if youve got something to say on it please say it loud and 
clear 
at issue is a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
to roll back the social security tax increase that took effect jan 
1 and further reduce the levy next year a principal aim of the 
plan is to prevent the government from using surplus social 
security taxes to make the overall federal deficit appear smaller 
advocacy groups for the elderly generally have welcomed the 
attention moynihans proposal is focusing on the need to protect 
the social security trust funds but they have been wary of his 
taxcut plan voicing fears about its potential effects on benefits 
and on the financial soundness of the system 
mrs kings declaration that congress should keep your hands 
off social security drew warm applause from the aarp audience 
moynihan widely respected as a leading advocate for social 
security visited the aarps legislative conference earlier this 
week in an effort to enlist their support he told council members 
how you decide will have great consequence it will make a 
difference 
he tried to assure the group his plan would pose no risk to 
benefits at any time and was needed to keep the trust funds from 
being misused 
moynihan was accompanied by robert myers a former chief actuary 
of the social security administration who told the group the 
senators plan would help keep the giant retirement system on sound 
financial ground 
the aarps 38member legislative council was expected to forward 
its social security policy recommendations friday to the groups 
executive committee which sets policy for the organization of 31 
million members 
aarps council received the arguments from both sides of the 
social security issue politely and members expressed personal 
opinions on both sides of the issue 
dennis crites a council member from norman okla said 
moynihans plan drew attention to the budget problems but if it 
develops a life of its own it may be damaging 
council member lou schwartz of teaneck nj said he liked the 
plan because it would lower the taxes on those who can least 
afford to pay it and open the door to have the people that can 
afford to pay it pay it

weyerhaeuser co reported it lost 1287 
million in the fourth quarter after running up 461 million in 
restructuring costs before taxes 
the wood products company said thursday the loss for the quarter 
ended dec 31 amounted to 65 cents per share on sales of 26 
billion that compared with a profit of 1553 million or 73 cents 
a share on sales of 24 billion for the same period of 1988 
for the year weyerhaeuser earned 3411 million or 156 a 
share on sales of 101 billion compared with profits of 5656 
million or 268 a share on sales of 93 billion in 1988 
fullyear results reflected 497 million in restructuring costs 
during the last half of 1989 the company sold its milk carton 
gypsum wallboard most of its hardwood paneling and its nursery 
products businesses for a pretax gain of 47 million 
the company said thursday the restructuring charges were due 
principally to the closure or modification of some forest products 
facilities and other businesses a scaling down of real estate 
operations changes in operations of its westwood shipping lines 
personal care products and containerboard packaging businesses and 
the planned sale of weyerhaeusers savings and loan business 
george weyerhaeuser chairman and chief executive officer said 
the restructure charge will have no adverse effect on the companys 
financial strength but rather improves the companys 
competitiveness 
weyerhaeuser said weakness in fine paper markets and high costs 
for maintenance in pulp and paper operations in the fourth quarter 
were partially offset by strong export markets and a runup in 
structural panel prices in october and november

declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of about 9 to 7 
on the new york stock exchange with 520 issues down 406 up and 
539 unchanged 
volume on the big board totaled 2140 million shares 
the labor department reported today that the nations 
unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent in january as the 
economy began the new year producing 275000 new jobs that was 
higher than market expectations for about 160000 nonfarm payroll 
jobs 
analysts said the market first reacted negatively behind a 
sliding bond market but bounced back after digesting the data 
the employment report was essentially a nonevent said 
larry wachtel analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
job growth was overstated given the seasonal factors involved 
and manufacturing employment continued to fall and to the degree 
the market was concerned about a recession we now have more 
information that there is not recession he said 
the government said the strong job growth figures might be 
exaggerated because warm january weather that followed a bitter

the nations unemployment rate held steady at 
53 percent in january as the economy began the new year by 
producing 275000 new jobs the government said today 
it was the eighth consecutive month with no change in the 
unemployment level 
but the labor department said the strong job growth figures 
might be overstated because warm january weather that followed a 
bitter cold december made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals 
for construction and other industries affected by weather 
delays in the reporting of postchristmas layoffs in retail 
trade also may have skewed the numbers 
the manufacturing slump added to the overall slowdown in the 
nations economy last year and todays report the first 
comprehensive look at economic activity in 1990 indicated that 
the sectors lackluster performance is continuing this year 
factory jobs dropped 112000 last month with 90000 of the 
losses suffered by the struggling auto industry it was the 10th 
straight month manufacturing jobs declined 
still analysts saw the economys ability to absorb those 
declines without a hike in the jobless rate as an encouraging sign 
the auto industry has taken a really big hit but the rest of 
the economy is marching along and has virtually swallowed up the 
manufacturing losses said robert dederick chief economist for 
the northern trust co of chicago 
it certainly indicates that the economy is weathering the 
storm it has favorable implications for later on dederick said 
manufacturing losses were especially felt in michigan where the 
jobless rate jumped to 84 percent in january up from 72 percent 
in december that was the largest unemployment increase in the 11 
large industrial states surveyed by the government 
however the government said many of the laidoff auto workers 
have been recalled since the survey of business establishments last 
month to gauge job growth 
construction employers reported a gain of 104000 jobs during 
last months mild weather after a 50000job loss during december 
mining industries which includes oil drilling added 1000 jobs 
meanwhile the serviceproducing industries which carried the 
economy last year continued to demonstrate healthy gains this 
year those industries reported 284000 new jobs with 48000 of 
them created in health services 
other industries of the service sector posting large gains were 
transportation with 27000 new jobs wholesale trade 2400 new 
jobs retail trade 127000 the last figure though is likely 
overstated because of problems factoring in seasonal adjustments 
after christmas 
average hourly earnings sometimes an advanced warning of 
inflationary pressures on the economy were up just 01 percent in 
january to 984 the average work week for production and 
nonsupervisory workers edged up 01 hour last month to 346 hours 
but in manufacturing the average work week was unchanged at 407 
hours 
the government said that the civilian labor force the number of 
people with jobs or actively seeking employment declined by 
149000 last month to 124 million the number of americans with 
jobs fell by 25000 to 1178 million 
there were few major shifts in the jobless rate among major 
demographic groups last month the biggest change among hispanics 
where unemployment fell from 85 percent in december to 71 percent 
in january 
the rates among other groups were 
adult white men 40 percent up from 39 percent in december 
adult white women 40 percent down from 41 percent 
white teenagers 124 percent up from 119 percent 
all blacks 113 percent down from 118 percent 
adult black men 112 percent up from 108 percent 
adult black women 92 percent down from 100 percent 
black teenagers 267 percent down from 307 percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the january 
jobless rate was 52 percent down from 53 percent in december

expected for the weekend moisture also was predicted for this 
weekend in the us winter wheat country

linked to thursdays weekly agriculture department grain exports

the chicago board of trade signed a memo of 
understanding friday to assist chinas preparations in establishing 
what would be the socialist worlds first agricultural futures 
market 
under the memo signed with the research institute of commmerce 
a division of the commerce ministry the board of trade would 
provide educational assistance on futures trading 
in turn the ministry agreed to introduce chinese agricultural 
enterprises to the board of trade the worlds largest futures 
exchange and the china national cereals trade corporation will 
prepare to participate in futures trading in chicago 
in china approximately 65 million tons of agricultural 
commodities circulate in the free market each year and are 
therefore subject to price risk said william d grossman vice 
president and managing director of the board of trades 
asiapacific office in tokyo as a result the conditions are 
ripe to learn about futures trading 
futures are agreements to buy or sell a product such as 
agricultural commodities like rice wheat or frozen concentrated 
orange juice at a set price on a specific future date 
because the seller is guaranteed that price regardless of 
subsequent market fluctuations producers frequently use the 
futures market to hedge the investment in their crop speculators 
also use futures to bet on price movements 
most of the 400 million tons of grain chinese farmers produce 
annually is contracted to the state at a set price however after 
meeting their contracts farmers are allowed to sell any excess 
produce on the free markets 
chinas constant problems with shortages and gluts an aspect 
of central planning and poor regulation of the free markets have 
led to wild fluctuations in market prices worsening supplydemand 
imbalances 
in early 1988 when reformers still held the balance of power in 
beijing plans were announced to set up experimental futures 
markets in several chinese cities but at the end of 1988 when 
conservatives exerted control over the overheated economy the 
government postponed plans for the futures market 
grossman said he had been assured by commerce minister hu ping 
that establishment of the markets had been delayed due to 
inadequate preparation and resources not for ideological reasons 
in the past china branded futures markets as a form of 
capitalist speculation the nations current conservative leaders 
have stressed that market forces always will play a secondary role 
in the staterun economy 
grossman said in an interview that the first market confined to 
wheat trading in the central china city of zhengzhou was ready for 
final approval last spring but was again put in the bottom of the 
inbox following the political turmoil that climaxed with the 
bloody military crackdown against the prodemocracy movement last 
june 
he said the zhengzhou market could be opened in time for the 
winter wheat harvest in may or june 
zhang qipan director of the research institute of commerce was 
less optimistic saying the market still was in the planning stage 
and could open this year 
this is an experiment if it succeeds then its possible we 
might do the same thing in a few other places zhang said 
right now we still dont have the right conditions for a futures 
market 
grossman said the zhengzhou market will not be a true futures 
market where trading is done with standardized contracts of large 
set volumes instead it will be more of an informal cash 
wholesaling market 
individual farmers will not participate and speculation will be 
prohibited he said some 20 to 30 organizations will take part in 
daily auctions with grain trading corporations and feed mills 
selling to large food processors and distributors 
the board of trade will have only an advisory role and will play 
no part in operating the market in return the board will be 
introduced to potential chinese traders for the chicago market 
we are the worlds largest futures exchange market grossman 
said we have a vested interest in seeing such markets develop 
properly around the world

autoworkers some with more than a 
quartercentury of work at chrysler corps jefferson avenue

plant walked out of the factory and into a gray snowy morning 
i walked around a little bit he said and thought about his 
25 years at the jefferson avenue plant one of the industrys 
oldest winchester said he hoped he would be recalled when training 
begins for jefferson north which is to begin producing a 
sportutility vehicle in late 1992 
i didnt get any guarantees he said 
winchester like others will head to the unemployment line 
instead of the assembly line monday 
im just going to get settled and see what happens he said 
as he crossed the six lanes of jefferson avenue which splits the 
83yearold plant in two 
buildings on both sides of the street will be demolished and 
chrysler will incorporate the land on the north side of jefferson 
into the new plant the company hasnt decided what it will do with 
more than 100 acres on the south side of jefferson 
another worker henry anderson of detroit also closed out 25 
years of working for chrysler he was laid off once before when 
the companys dodge main assembly plant in hamtramck mich was 
shut down in january 1980 
he said hes had enough 
im going to school for robotics and tv and radio repair 
anderson said 
the laid off workers will be eligible to draw from a variety of 
funds which could bring benefits while on layoff to as much as 95 
percent of their straighttime pay while they were working 
officials of united auto workers union local 7 which represents 
the jefferson avenue workers doubt if the funds will be healthy 
enough to maintain that level by the time retraining for jefferson 
north begins 
they said layoffs the automaker already has announced for later 
this year will boost the number of eligible people those on 
indefinite layoff drawing against the funds between now and the 
end of march chrysler will lay off indefinitely nearly 6000 
workers 
jefferson avenue is the second plant chrysler has shut down 
since 1988 but it wont be the last this year on thursday the 
company announced it would close its st louis car plant in 
midseptember 
that closing will bring to seven the number of assembly plants 
chrysler and general motors corp will have closed in three years 
ford motor co meantime has avoided closing plants by keeping its 
car and truck sales healthy and eliminating large amounts of 
overtime it used instead of opening a new plant 
while the domestic automakers slash their production japanese 
companies have been adding to their us production in plants they 
own either wholly or partly 
since 1988 mitsubishi motors corp and chrysler opened a plant 
in normal ill toyota motor corp began production at its own 
plant in georgetown ky subaru of america and isuzu motors ltd

a zoologist accused of unleashing a computer 
virus that crippled computers in england two months ago with a fake 
information disk on aids was arrested on a fugitive warrant in ohio 
joseph w popp was arrested thursday and is being held on a 
federal fugitive warrant he is charged in warrants issued by 
scotland yard in london with blackmail and extortion 
during an initial court appearance here today popp 39 told 
us magistrate joseph w bartunek that he is under a 
psychiatrists care and must take drugs for a mental condition 
bartunek said he would schedule another hearing after two 
psychiatrists evaluate popp to see whether he is competent to face 
further proceedings a date was not set 
popp a zoologist who worked for the world health organization 
is from willowick about 10 miles east of cleveland said defense 
attorney john p kilroy it was not immediately clear whether popp 
is still affiliated with the organization 
the warrant alleges popp distributed about 20000 
computercrippling disks from london around dec 11 the disks were 
labeled aids information introductory diskette 
the us attorneys office in cleveland said the disks had 
information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome for use by 
hospitals researchers and others 
but authorities said the disks when inserted into personal 
computers by unsuspecting recipients halted accessibility to any 
other information in the computer 
at the end of the program the disk asked the computer user for 
a leasing fee of up to 378 then printed an invoice with a panama 
address where money was to be sent federal prosecutors said 
computer owners were told that the rogue program they had inserted 
in their computer would stop the machine from functioning unless 
the money was paid 
at the time the diskette began causing problems in early 
december authorities in london said it had been received by users 
in norway sweden belgium denmark and california as well as 
britain scotland yard said at least 10 british computers were 
affected later in the month a company in bahrain in the midle 
east also reported getting one of the disks but said it was 
discovered before it did any damage

the west german finance chief on friday 
suggested circulating his countrys currency in east germany and 
the soviet union showed its greatest tolerance yet for unifying the 
states 
the idea of the prosperous west merging with the impoverished 
east continued to shape the debate over how to rescue east germany 
from economic collapse and political paralysis 
east germans have brought their economy to a standstill with 
strikes protests and spiraling absenteeism as the country careens 
toward its first free elections march 18 
dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer an influential and popular 
reformer said complete collapse is imminent unless workers are 
given a convertible currency this year and the steady flood of 
people leaving the country is stopped 
my fear is that in the next few days and weeks an exodus of 
hundreds of thousands will develop and if this situation is not 
quickly counteracted it will lead to political and economic 
collapse berghofer said 
premier hans modrow also acknowledged this week the nation is 
nearing collapse 
untold thousands are working illegally in west berlin earning 
west german marks that have at least 10 times the buying power of 
the meager ostmarks they earn in their jobs in the east 
west german officials have previously proposed plans for 
eventual convertibility of the ostmark but finance minister theo 
waigel suggested friday that a more immediate and effective measure 
might be wholesale introduction of the deutschmark 
he said it would give the population prospects for the future 
that are immediately convincing 
a common currency is one of the steps toward unification of 
germany proposed by both modrow and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl 
a soviet government spokesman visiting east berlin acknowledged 
the situation in east germany is extremely sensitive 
yuri gremitskikh said strikes and demonstrations had cut deeply 
into industrial performance 
gremitskikh also confirmed that the kremlin has had to accept 
reunification as an inevitable consequence of the democratic 
revolutions sweeping eastern europe 
he repeated the soviet view that a reunified germany should not 
belong to either the nato or warsaw pact alliances but declined to 
say whether the soviet union would veto reunification if west 
german territory retained nato forces 
the soviet union the united states france and britain retain 
control of berlin under their status as the four victorious powers 
from world war ii they essentially would have to approve 
unification to allow berlin to be part of a single german state 
in moscow foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze proposed 
friday that europeans americans and canadians vote on 
reunification because they suffered so much in world war ii 
the soviet envoy gave the kremlins strongest endorsement yet to 
reunification but repeated conditions that this must not 
destabilize europe german unity should be decided in a referendum 
among europeans canadians and americans or through wide 
parliamentary discussions shevardnadze said in the interview 
carried by the official news agency tass 
communist party leader gregor gysi flew to moscow on friday for 
talks with president mikhail s gorbachev on east germany 
kohl and modrow plan their second summit on feb 1314 in bonn 
but the two arranged to meet privately saturday while in davos 
switzerland for an international economics conference 
west german government spokesman dieter vogel told reporters in 
bonn that the talks would focus on ways west germany can aid east 
germans until the elections 
modrow on thursday proposed a plan for reunifying germany and 
called for talks with west germany to work out details 
kohl rejected the east german premiers condition that a united 
germany be militarily neutral but said he would be willing to 
enter negotiations after the vote 
uniting the germanys has become likely since a prodemocracy 
revolution ousted hardline east german leader erich honecker on 
oct 18 leading to the opening of the berlin wall and installation 
of a reformoriented coalition government

wheat futures prices rose moderately friday on 
the chicago board of trade in response to news late in the session 
that china was seeking to buy 300000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
corn futures closed slightly lower while the oat and soybean 
markets ended mixed 
the china bid was not unexpected since the chinese had 300000 
metric tons of wheat left to buy under an allocation extended by 
the agriculture department last year 
but a recent slowdown in export sales of wheat has contributed 
to a price drop of more than 35 cents a bushel since middecember 
so any sign of stronger demand is likely to rally the market 
analysts said 
katherina zimmer grains analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc said the bids proposed delivery dates in april and 
may were earlier than expected but she dismissed fridays rally 
as insignificant relative to the recent decline 
its nothing she said 
at the close of trading wheat futures were 1 cent to 4 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in march at 379 a bushel 
corn futures were cent to 2 cents lower with march at 236 a 
bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with march at 
135 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to cent higher with 
march at 560 a bushel

if a michael jackson doll can do well 
then can dolls modeled after the fiveman rock group new kids on 
the block do five times as well 
toymaker hasbro inc should find out soon enough as it launches 
a line under an agreement with the new kids ranked the hottest pop 
group of 1989 by billboard magazine 
wayne charness a hasbro spokesman confirmed friday that a deal 
had been reached between the toy company and the group but said 
details would be announced at a news conference monday at new 
yorks hard rock cafe 
the new line will include dolls and items related to their 
music said win wilford an executive vice president of dick scott 
entertainment which manages the group 
its been years since a major toy company made a doll based on a 
pop musician said paul valentine a toy industry analyst for 
standard amp poors corp 
valentine said that plans for a new kids product sound like a 
terrific idea to me the michael jackson doll was launched by ljn 
toys ltd of new york five years ago and did exceptionally well 
for a short period of time he said 
an ljn spokesman who asked that his name not be used said the 
company sold at least a couple of hundred thousand jackson 
dolls 
although the doll was on the market for less than a year it 
was considered a very successful product he said 
these things do have a lifespan but with proper marketing 
within the lifespan it can be very lucrative he said 
hasbro has a solid product line including the gi joe action 
figure tinkertoys the donald trump board game and cabbage patch 
kids it even launched some dolls fashioned after the characters 
from the movie who framed roger rabbit 
the rule of thumb in the industry was that toys based on 
motion pictures or personalities tended to be shortlived but the 
rules have been broken so often that everyone is scrambling to find 
out what works valentine said thursday 
an animated saturdaymorning cartoon series based on the new 
kids is being developed for network television said wilford 
the new kids whose members range in age from 17 to 20 are 
popular among adolescent girls and also their parents because of 
their antidrug message 
the parents feel comfortable he said because of the 
clean image 
the group was assembled in 1984 by boston producer maurice starr 
and started its first major tour last summer as an opening act for 
former teenqueen tiffany by the end of the trip tiffany was 
opening for the new kids 
some have criticized the group because none of its members play 
instruments but others have compared it to the jackson 5 and the 
monkees 
everything is turning out wonderful about these kids said 
wilford the concerts are sold out the records are selling in 
millions 
the kids who have sold about 115 million albums in three 
releases including the popular hangin tough album have a new one 
due out in march said wilford 
a european tour starts in april

stock prices after recovering from an early 
slump closed higher following a report on january employment that 
helped ease worries that the economy may be moving into a recession 
the labor department reported today that the nations 
unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent last month while 
275000 new nonfarm payroll jobs were created 
the number of new jobs was substantially higher than market 
expectations of about 160000 jobs analysts said 
but the government said the strong job growth figures might be 
exaggerated because warm january weather that followed a bitter 
cold december made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for 
construction and other industries affected by weather 
delays in the reporting of postchristmas layoffs in retail 
trade also may have skewed the numbers the government said 
the market first reacted negatively to the jobs data in response 
to a slide in the bond market but quickly bounced back after 
digesting the data 
analysts said the data while suggesting the economy continued 
to slow in january as the manufacturing sector slumped also 
indicated that the economy is not headed for a recession and may be 
breaking out of its recent doldrums 
traders said renewed merger activity also helped revive takeover 
stocks in particular drug and biotechnology stocks got a boost 
from news that roche holdings would acquire a majority stake in 
genentech corp 
were having a rally from an oversold condition said 
charles jensen chief technical analyst for mki securities corp 
its a long overdue rally 
late in the day the market retraced some of its gains as 
investors remained cautious ahead of next weeks 30 billion 
treasury refunding which could provide a better clue about the

bank of boston corp the biggest bank in new 
england is streamlining its structure and operations as part of a 
plan to expand in the region and upgrade its services worldwide 
chairman ira stepanian announced friday 
the announcement was timed with another one the retirement of 
clark w miller hed of the banks new england banking group and 
chief architect of the banks reorganization 
the moves miller orchestrated include consolidating the 
corporations five business groups into three 
miller had told the banks management more than two years ago 
that he planned to retire on turning 60 which occurred last week 
his departure after 27 years at the bank is effective march 31 
the changes at bank of boston the 15thlargest bank in the 
country with assets of 39 billion at the close of 1989 come at a 
time when the new england banking industry is suffering financial 
troubles and shaking up executive offices four senior officials of 
the bank of new england were let go earlier this week 
but bank of boston spokesman wayne taylor said friday that a 
reorganization at his institution was called for ever since the 
bank started acquiring other new england banks in 1984 
this is a logical strategy taylor said it does not have 
anything to do with problems in the new england economy or real 
estate development this was a longterm plan 
the sagging economy and real estate market have been blamed in 
part for the banking industrys difficulties 
customers whether commercial or retail will see no change as a 
result of the restructuring other than more uniformity and 
availability of bank products and services such as the opening of 
more branches taylor said 
bank of bostons major banking subsidiaries are first national 
bank of boston casco northern bank bank of boston connecticut 
rhode island hospital trust national bank and bank of vermont 
the bank posted a small gain in the fourth quarter after selling 
its credit card business to chase manhattan 
stepanian in a prepared statement described the corporate 
overhaul as a realignment of our organizational structure 
designed to achieve greater strategic focus marketing synergy 
operational efficiency and internal coordination 
this organizational realignment will in turn maximize the 
earnings power and value of our enterprise to stockholders said 
stepanian who also is the companys chief operating officer 
the restructuring will establish three banking groups new 
england banking national banking and global banking within those 
three will be the restructured operations of the real estate and 
treasurybanking services groups 
peter c read most recently head of the treasurybanking 
services group will succeed miller 
the bank outlined the restructuring as follows 
new england banking group under a plan to achieve regional 
integration begun by miller and now to be overseen by read this 
group will reorganize its management and operations to establish 
them regionwide in four areas retail banking commercial banking 
personal trust and private banking and external affairs and 
marketing 
national banking group this section will focus on relationship 
banking and on serving us businesses it will now include the 
commercial lending operation handled by the former real estate 
group this group will also now contain the banks leasing 
division which will be transferred from the former 
treasurybanking services group t lincoln morison jr an 
executive vice president will continue to manage this group 
global banking group kevin j mulvaney an executive vice 
president will continue to run this group formerly the 
international banking group under the restructuring the group 
will broaden the scope of its operations to provide more banking 
products and services to its customers worldwide one aim is to

john j phelan jr led the new york stock 
exchange into the computer age his successor may have to take it 
into further dimensions 
when phelan retires as chairman of the nations largest exchange 
at the end of the year the nyse will face issues experts believe 
threaten to remold the way the stock market operates by the year 
2000 
among its greatest challenges are a relentless growth in 
technology including computerassisted trading techniques and 
trading floor automation 
the 198yearold exchange also must compete in interlocked 
global markets an aroundtheclock battle that threatens to siphon 
away business and may force the nyse to change its 930 am to 4 
pm trading day 
were potentially looking at a very different industry eric 
k clemons an associate professor at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school said friday 
the challenge to johns successor will be preserving all the 
things the exchange does well while minimizing the disruption to 
the various communities he serves clemons said 
in his six years as big board chairman and chief executive the 
mildmannered phelan has balanced the concerns of floor brokers and 
specialists small investors big institutions and companies whose 
stocks are traded there 
phelan foresaw dynamic growth in trading volume to 165 million 
shares a day last year from 186 million when he became vice 
chairman in 1975 and the potential for disaster that came with it 
and he skillfully persuaded floor professionals that installing 
computers wouldnt destroy their business 
in fact phelan cites modernizing the trading system as his 
greatest achievement because it allowed the exchange to stay open 
and handle 600 million shares during the oct 19 1987 market 
crash when some fully automated markets closed down 
with competition and telecommunications the impact of 
technology has not yet fully had its effect on the new york stock 
exchange said hans stoll a finance professor at vanderbilt 
universitys graduate management school in nashville tenn 
experts believe a calming presence and diplomatic talent like 
phelans is needed to prevent bad blood from developing over how 
the big board responds to change 
you do have a floor and the floor has a strong opinion and a 
strong voice but there are other constituencies said john w 
bachmann a managing partner with edward d jones amp co the st 
louisbased retail brokerage theres going to be a need to 
balance the interest of each of those groups 
as the tokyo stock exchange continues to draw attention as a 
financial center and europe looms as a greater power following the 
common markets planned economic integration in 1992 many experts 
say the nyse could lose business overseas domestic markets 
offering afterhours trading via computer also pose a threat 
under the existing system more than 80 percent of trades are 
routed to the nyse floor electronically and the rest manually by 
brokers working a battery of telephones specialists set trading 
prices and execute the orders to ensure a fair and orderly market 
critics of the specialist system maintain that all trades one 
day will be handled automatically and the stock exchange floor will 
become a computer room that may eventually leave its lower 
manhattan home on wall street 
proponents say further adaptation to computerization is 
inevitable but human beings will remain essential to keeping the 
us markets stable 
you need all the hardware and software possible but its still 
going to be a market determined by men and women said robert n

trading forces his successor may be forced to regulate if the 
government doesnt do it first what forms of computerdriven 
trading are permitted 
one possible reform is realtime reporting of program 
trading activity to give market players an idea of how much program 
trading which has been accused of exaggerating volatility is 
taking place for example such activity might be reported every 
five minutes 
at a news conference thursday announcing his retirement phelan 
showed his evenhanded style in discussing program trading you 
probably do more by cooperation than by fiat or somebody passing a 
law or regulation about it he said 
he also said markets need to accommodate both small investors 
and institutions securities industry association figures show that 
institutions accounted for 76 percent of nyse volume from 
januarynovember 1989 but experts say the number of retail 
transactions remains larger 
there are people on both sides who want to exclude other 
people from the marketplace phelan said you cannot run a 
marketplace to the exclusion of any one element

members of congress criticized the insurance 
industry friday for socking the elderly with huge price increases 
for medigap health policies and said tougher regulation may be 
needed to curb price and marketing abuses 
millions of seniors spend billions of dollars each year on 
medigap policies and many are being ripped off and cheated out of 
their limited fixed incomes rep ron wyden dore told a 
senate finance subcommittee 
this medigap mess has flourished because federal regulation is 
a voluntary unenforceable patchwork of legal mumbojumbo more 
loophole than law 
private insurance companies sell medigap policies to the elderly 
to bridge gaps in their coverage from medicare premiums are rising 
sharply this year insurers say the increases are justified because 
healthcare costs are rising and because benefits must be provided 
that previously were offered under medicares catastrophiccare 
program 
but several members of the senate subcommittee on medicare and 
longterm care questioned whether this years big rate increases 
are warranted even with rising costs and the repeal of the 
catastrophiccare program 
we simply cannot tolerate the sale of medigap insurance 
policies that are overpriced or undervalued especially at these 
prices said the subcommittee chairman sen jay rockefeller 
dwva 
the legislators also complained that marketing abuses continue 
in the medigap industry with highpressure salesmen selling 
duplicative and unnecessary policies to frightened old people 
we continue to find people with five to 10 medigap policies 
that are overpriced oversold and seldom used said sen david 
pryor dark 
janet shikles of the general accounting office told the panel 
that surveys found 1990 medigap rate increases averaging 20 percent 
among 20 commercial insurers and averaging 29 percent for 
individual policies sold by blue cross and blue shield rate 
increases ranged from 5 percent to 52 percent 
shikles said many insurance companies fail to meet even minimum 
targets established by federal law and enforced by the states on 
what percentage of premium dollars collected should be paid out in 
benefits 
many companies pay out benefits that equal less than 60 percent 
of what they collect in premiums she said among blue crossblue 
shield plans however 98 percent met or surpassed the lossratio 
standards she said 
we are continuing to find that policies are being marketed to 
the elderly that are not meeting the minimum standards and these 
are not difficult standards to meet shikles said many of the 
rate increases seem very high 
however earl r pomeroy president of the national association 
of insurance commissioners and insurance commissioner for north 
dakota said state regulators have been closely monitoring rate 
increases and believe most are supported by the costs of the 
benefits that the insurance companies must restore and prior 
claims experience 
linda jenckes vice president of the health insurance 
association of america said medigap already is the most highly 
regulated form of insurance and that no added restrictions are 
needed 
she said recent price increases were justified by the rising 
costs of health care the added catastrophic benefits and other 
factors jenckes said occasional abuses in the system are being 
adequately addressed by state regulators

a strong rally in oil futures prices friday on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
on other commodity markets copper and precious metal futures 
rose livestock and meat futures were mixed and grains and 
soybeans were mixed 
gasoline futures posted the sharpest gains settling 83 cent to 
19 cents higher with the contract for delivery in march at 6422 
cents a gallon west texas intermediate crude oil finished 32 cent 
to 44 cent higher with march at 2302 cents gallon heating oil 
was 77 cent to 152 cents higher with march at 5826 cents a 
gallon 
fridays strong rally after modest gains on thursday suggests 
the petroleum markets are beginning a new upward push analysts 
said 
another sign of a developing bull move was the markets hohum 
reaction to tuesdays weekly american petroleum institute inventory 
report which showed largerthanexpected supplies of crude oil and 
refined products especially gasoline 
sights are getting set further out said randolph donney a 
research analyst with elders futures inc in new york people are 
not really focusing on nearterm fundamentals that much 
indeed the strongest gains friday were in contracts for april 
and may delivery indicating that petroleum dealers are locking in 
supplies for the late spring and early summer when the vacation 
season begins and gasoline consumption swells 
strong gasoline demand tends to boost us crude futures prices

is more easily refined into highquality gasoline than some other 
varieties donney noted

have also been falling recently and mondays report is expected to 
show a further decline of 2000 to 5000 tons analysts said 
demand for copper apparently is picking up after slackening in 
december 
some buying also may have stemmed from brighter economic 
perceptions due to the stock markets recent gains and fridays 
us unemployment report which showed no change in the jobless 
rate

mcgrawhill inc pulled the plug friday on its 
electronic business news services saying the market for them was 
developing more slowly than expected 
in view of the current business climate and the uncertain 
economic outlook mcgrawhill is going to focus its resources on 
opportunities with an earlier payoff the company said in a 
statement 
the unexpected decision to close its mcgrawhill news and 
standard amp poors news services at the close of business friday 
came only a day after the company reported a fourthquarter loss of 
983 million due mainly to the impact of a corporate 
restructuring 
the company had disclosed in december that it planned to charge 
152 million after taxes against its fourthquarter earnings to 
reflect a realignment of operations asset writedowns the closing 
of its general book division and creation of a reserve for 
severance payments associated with the elimination of more than 
1000 jobs 
the services were designed to provide an assortment of business 
economic an financial news throughout the day in competition with 
similar services from dow jones amp co reuters holdings plc and 
others 
the securities industry has been slumping in recent months 
however as retail investment activity failed to rebound in the 
wake of the october 1987 market crash 
the announcement of the shutdown came after the close of the 
stock market in trading on the new york stock exchange 
mcgrawhill closed at 5550 a share down 87 cents 
the two mcgrawhill news services employed about 75 people 
including nine stationed at foreign offices in tokyo london 
frankfurt and paris its domestic offices were in new york 
washgington dc detroit chicago and san francisco 
the company said it would make every effort to place the 
staff in other psoitions within mcgrawhill which publishes 
business week magazine has interests in broadcasting and offers a 
variety of information services for a range of businesses 
the company declined to say how much revenue was generated by 
the two services or how much it had invested in getting them in 
operation 
the editors did a fine job of creating an online business 
news service but the market for the product is developing more 
slowly than anticipated the company said 
the mcgrawhill news service was introduced in september 1987 
and was made available directly to corporations and indirectly to 
other customers through eight database distributors 
standard amp poors news was announced only last december and was 
designed for the retail stock brokerage business the company said 
in december that it had signed the brokerage edward d jones of st 
louis with 1450 offices 
company spokeswoman betsy russo said the staff of the two news 
services was notified by management friday of the plans to close 
the systems at the end of the business day 
she said the company expected no additional writedown would be 
needed as a result of the shutdown because the fourthquarter 
charges provided for additional streamlining that had been 
undetermined at that point

president bush citing credible confidential 
information on friday ordered a chineseowned corporation to 
sell its interests in a seattle aircraft parts company 
bush ordered the divestiture on national security grounds of 
the mamco manufacturing co of seattle by the china national 
aerotechnology import and export corp 
in ordering the action bush invoked for the first time a 
provision of a 1988 trade law that gives the president the power to 
restrict foreign investment in the united states if the nations 
security is affected 
the president ordered the chinese government to sell the company 
because continued control of mamco might threaten to impair the 
national security a white house statement said the statement 
cited credible confidential information for negating chinas 
1988 purchase of the seattle company 
mamco manufactures metal parts for aircraft bushs action 
upheld the recommendation of an interagency review panel that the 
deal be voided 
the panel found that the company which reported 20 million in 
sales in 1988 was involved with sensitive materials that could 
have military applications said officials who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
the presidents order requires china to divest itself of mamco 
by may 1 uness an extension of up to three months is granted 
bush took the action even though his administration had been 
moving towards reestablishing contacts with the beijing government 
in the aftermath of the tiananmen square crackdown last june 
sanctions bush himself imposed on china in the aftermath of that 
crackdown bar all military sales to china 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that bushs action 
is in response to the circumstances of this particular 
transaction it does not change our policy and it is not a 
precedent for the future with regard to direct investment in the 
united states from the peoples republic of china or any other 
country 
a white house statement said the presidents action is based 
on his finding that there is credible evidence that leads him to 
believe that the acquistion could threaten the national security of 
the united states 
the chinese corporation is part of the chinese ministry of 
aereospace industry it has business dealings with various us 
companies in several sectors including commercial aircraft 
the statement said 
under terms of the trade act bush had 15 days to review the 
recommendation of the committee on foreign investment in the united 
states the time would have expired at midnight 
bush was given the authority under the law to order the chinese 
corporation to cease its us operations and sell its stock in the 
seattle company 
his decision came a week after bush narrowly won a congressional 
vote sustaining his veto of a bill to extend visas of chinese 
students in the united states who do not want to return home for 
fear of persecution 
bush veoted that bill calling it an infringement on his 
presidential prerogatives and claiming it was unnecesssary because 
he had issued an executive order accomplishing the same protection 
for chinese students

the acting chairman of bank of new england which 
is trying to rebound from the 1 billion loss projected for 1989 
said friday the bank probably wouldnt turn a profit this year but 
should come out ahead in the long run 
were in a fixit mode were not going to be as big but 
were going to be better said interim chairman h ridgely 
bullock who was named by the board of directors last week 
bullock also told a news conference that the bank continues 
experiencing deposit outflows sparked by the recent disclosure of 
the extent of its financial problems and would have to keep 
borrowing from the federal government to meet the demands of 
depositors 
bullock replaced walter j connolly jr who was asked to leave 
in the wake of serious financial problems at the company which 
with 29 billion in assets ranks as the nations 18th largest 
banking concern 
bank of new england reported its projected 1 billion annual 
loss on jan 20 fourthquarter losses were estimated at 12 
billion among the biggest quarterly losses ever reported by a bank 
of its size 
the company has attributed much of the banks problem to bad 
real estate loans issued in the northeast which now total more 
than 25 billion the banks capital has plunged below 500 
million or less than 2 percent of the institutions total assets 
bullock said the bank was hit hard by the declines in the real 
estate market partly because lenders were not cautious enough with 
developers 
i think we had drifted away from the real basics of lending 
bullock said its a very tough business and it has to be managed 
very toughly 
one of the first tasks for the banks new management would be to 
address the hundreds of depositors who have been withdrawing their 
funds from the bank since it publicly acknowledged the depths of 
its problems 
bullock declined to specify how many depositors were leaving the 
bank several municipalities including the city of boston and 
several cities and towns in massachusetts and connecticut have 
withdrawn millions of dollars from the ailing institution 
officials said 
bullock also said the bank expected the outflow to continue but 
assured that the bank was safe for depositors 
he confirmed recent reports that the federal reserve had lent 
bank of new england over 400 million in the week ended wednesday 
a week after it reportedly borrowed up to 475 million 
bullock said the bank expected to continue seeking loans from 
the federal reserve for some time as it sought to meet the 
demands of depositors withdrawing their funds from the bank 
bullock said the bank was taking several steps to regain its 
balance including the sale of more than 450 million worth of 
leasing assets and its credit card operations for 820 million the 
moves were two in a series of sales planned to net the bank 6 
billion he said 
bullock said he did not expect the bank to make money during the 
rest of 1990 because of the costs associated with restructuring 
management shakeups and the quick pace of selling assets 
bank officials also were looking into the possibility of selling 
subsidiaries including connecticut bank and trust and banks in 
maine and rhode island no bids had been received yet bullock said 
we want to make sure if we cut a deal that it is one we are 
pleased with when we close it six months later bullock said 
this is not any fire sale 
part of what would put the bank on track would be changing its 
corporate culture bullock said such changes would include getting 
rid of personal perks that have often accompanied banking jobs in 
the past he said 
major changes also have been made in upperlevel management 
where five top executives including connolly have left since jan

the stock market rallied friday after a

the labor department reported that the nations unemployment 
rate held steady at 53 percent last month while 275000 new 
nonfarm payroll jobs were created the number of new jobs was 
substantially higher than market expectations of about 160000 
jobs analysts said 
stock investors took the attitude that employment is better 
than expected which means business is better than expected and the 
economy is not in a recession said jack solomon equities 
analyst for bear stearns amp co that coming on top of a negative 
psychological environment it was easy for the market to spring up 
the market had declined sharply last month as the dow 
industrials lost more than 219 points 
but the government said the strong job growth figures might be 
exaggerated because warm january weather that followed a bitter 
cold december made it tough to seasonally adjust job totals for 
construction and other industries affected by weather delays in 
the reporting of postchristmas layoffs in retail trade also may 
have skewed the numbers the government said 
the employment report also showed a continuing slump in the 
manufacturing sector as factory jobs fell by 112000 last month 
with 90000 of the losses suffered by the struggling auto industry 
it was the 10th straight month manufacturing jobs declined 
nonetheless analysts said the data while suggesting the 
economy continued to slow also indicated that the economy may be 
breaking out of its recent doldrums 
the unexpectedly large increase in new jobs helped todays 
rally in equities said charles jensen chief technical analyst 
for mki securities corp it eased expectations that we are moving 
into a recession and was encouraging for the economy 
the market first reacted negatively to the jobs data in response 
to a slide in the bond market but quickly bounced back after 
digesting the data 
traders said renewed merger activity also helped revive takeover 
stocks in particular drug and biotechnology stocks got a boost 
from news that roche holdings would acquire a majority stake in

the restructuring of engelhard corp the 
metals and chemical company once headed by the supposed model for 
james bond nemesis goldfinger could mean higher profits and a 
clearer corporate identity analysts said friday 
engelhard a leading metals refiner and maker of gold and silver 
products says it is selling those businesses to concentrate on 
chemical production and its promise of higher profit margins 
the iselinbased concern also has announced a restructuring that 
will shed 500 salaried jobs from its 8100member workforce and 
shut a number of plants worldwide 
engelhard stock fell 112 a share to 2037 on the new york 
stock exchange friday 
the restructuring announced thursday prompted engelhard to take 
a 160 million charge on 1989 earnings giving it a 775 million 
loss for the year fourth quarter losses were 1459 million 
compared with a 193 million profit a year earlier 
revenue for the year rose 52 million to 24 billion 
engelhard spokesman francis x vitale jr said the restructuring 
and sale of businesses should pare away 35 percent of its revenue 
thomas van leeuwen an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc 
in new york said the restructuring was overdue and that the 
companys performance had stagnated in the past five years 
engelhards performance has been hurt by a diversion of 
management attention to its electronics business and by competition 
from other major makers of catalysts such as wr grace and union 
carbide van leeuwen said catalysts are used in petroleum refining 
and chemical manufacturing 
cyclical changes in refining also have hurt with increased 
amounts of lighter grade crude oil coming on the market smaller 
amounts of catalysts are needed to break the oil down into 
petroleum products such as gasoline said analyst jeff cianci of 
bear stearns amp co in new york 
shedding the metals business could help focus attention on the 
operations that actually constitute engelhards main business 
possibly giving investors a better idea of the companys prospects 
investors have mistaken the true identity of this company in 
the past said van leeuwen many do not realize it does not 
produce gold and silver but only makes products from them and also 
that it has substantial chemical operations he said 
engelhard does have the nations largest gold and silver product 
manufacturing plant located in plainville mass 
the company was founded in newark in 1902 by charles w 
engelhard sr after he bought the charles croselmire co and began 
acquiring specialty metals firms his son charles w engelhard 
jr greatly expanded its operations 
the wealthy engelhard jr known as the platinum king also 
was a friend of james bond creator ian fleming and supposedly 
served as an inspiration for the character of the villain 
goldfinger 
engelhard was a portly figure who often carried an ebony cane 
and would joke with friends about his identification with the spy 
story villain according to a 1971 obituary

bond prices tumbled friday after a new 
government report on employment in january suggested the economy is 
stronger than expected diminishing chances for lower interest 
rates 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond lost point or 750 for 
every 1000 in face value its yield which rises when the price 
declines jumped to 850 percent from 843 percent late thursday 
analysts said bond prices fell after the labor department 
reported that the us unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent 
in january as the economy began the new year by producing 275000 
new jobs 
the job growth figure was about 100000 more than expected 
according to sung won sohn chief economist for norwest corp in 
minneapolis 
he noted the government also reported that orders for 
manufactured goods gained 19 percent in december and said that 
also was above most analysts expectations 
the economy is stronger than the market feels comforable with 
that diminishes chances that interest rates would decline and 
raised some inflation concerns he said 
a strong economy tends to hurt bond prices because interest 
rates normally rise in such periods eroding the value of bonds in 
circulation 
sohn said bonds finished above their lows of the day however 
because the dolar rose against the japanese yen making returns on 
dollardenominated investments more attractive to the japanese 
the japanese are usually relied on to buy a healthy amount of 
new treasury securities and strength in the dollar could help keep 
them interested next week as the government auctions 30 billion in 
new securities 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues declined lsqb point to 732 point intermediate 
maturities fell by between 516 point and 916 point and longterm 
issues dropped as much as 1316 point according to figures 
provided by telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 385 to 115926 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds slipped 116 point to 91 616 the average 
yield to maturity rose to 746 percent from 745 percent late 
thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 805 percent as the 
discount gained 4 basis points to 779 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills advanced to 815 percent as the discount gained 4 basis 
points at 774 percent yields on oneyear bills jumped to 811 
percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 757 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent unchanged from 
late thursday

mcdonnell douglas corp facing the end of 
two military aircraft contracts by 1993 may shift some work on its 
new jumbo jet from its overburdened long beach plant to st louis 
a spokesman said 
the strategy which officials said could avoid up to 12000 
layoffs in st louis is under discussion but no timetable has been 
set don hanson a spokesman for the companys long beachbased 
douglas aircraft unit said thursday 
hanson said a shift would not lead to any layoffs at douglas 
aircraft which is struggling with so many commercial aircraft 
orders that it is behind schedule on all its programs 
manufacturing components for the new md11 jumbo jet or other 
planes at mcdonnell aircraft co in st louis is a possibility 
hanson said 
they already build the nose section for the c17 the big 
cargo plane that douglas assembles in long beach he said 
until now mcdonnell aircraft has manufactured planes solely for 
the military 
william s ross president of mcdonnell aircraft said moving 
some of the md11 work to his division could help save about 12000 
jobs in st louis more work on douglas c17 military cargo plane 
also will be shifted to st louis ross said but he declined to 
discuss the timing 
st louisbased mcdonnell douglas is the nations top defense 
contractor 
by contrast with st louis long beach is very much full to 
capacity hanson said we have been looking for some time to 
find ways to put some of the work out to other sources 
douglas aircraft after increasing its payroll by about 20 
percent in each of the past four years has grown nearly as large 
as it can hanson said although a few more employees will be added 
this year 
douglas now employs about 45000 workers including 35000 in 
long beach and another 5000 in nearby torrance 
mcdonnell had previously announced plans to shift its t45a 
goshawk trainer program plagued by technical problems and delays 
to st louis from california 
about 1800 workers in st louis are to be reassigned to the 
goshawk program mcdonnell makes the f15e eagle fighter for the 
air force the av8b harrier ii shorttakeoffvertical landing jet 
for the marines and the fa18 hornet for the navy in st louis 
pentagon budget proposals announced this week call for phasing 
out eagle and harrier orders after sept 30 1991 although 
backlogs could keep the two planes in production until 1993 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers the largest union representing mcdonnell aircraft workers 
has been pushing mcdonnell douglas to shift more commercial 
aircraft work to st louis 
mcdonnell aircraft has avoided a major layoff of aircraft 
workers since phasing out in 1979 its production of the f4 
phantom the eagle fighters predecessor

an appellate court has ruled mgmua 
communications co may sue walt disney co for breach of contract 
because disney built a working studio as part of a florida theme 
park that uses the mgm name 
the ruling by the states 2nd district court of appeals earlier 
this week reverses a decision by the superior court attorney skip 
miller representing mgmua said thursday 
there are triable issues of fact regarding disneys intent to 
deceive the appellate court stated 
the action originally filed in the lower court may 17 1988 
concerns the disneymgm studios theme park near disney world in 
lake buena vista fla 
in june 1985 the entertainment giants agreed that disney would 
build the studio tour located on 135 acres the park includes a 
1950s sitcom set movietv sound studios with backstage tours and 
other special effects adventures 
the park opened in april 1989 and offered tourists a 
behindthescenes glimpse of hollywood movie and tv production 
began in summer 1988 with the superboy syndicated tv series and 
parts of several largescreen films while construction continued 
on the tourist attraction portion 
mgmua contends that disney broke its license agreement by using 
the mgm name on a fullscale operating motion picture production 
facility rather than in connection with a public amusement park 
built around the theme of motion pictures 
disney argued it could not run a studio tour without a 
production studio 
but the appellate court ruled that neither logic experience 
or evidence compel the conclusion a studio tour must be built 
around an actual working studio 
burbankbased disney said in a statement it would fight the 
complaint 
the prior judgment was upheld on all issues but one which is 
essentially whether we have the right to use the mgm name on our 
working florida studio the statement read 
while we would have preferred of course to have the judgment 
upheld on all counts we are prepared to go to trial on the 
remaining issue it concluded 
miller said the ruling cuts deeper 
it terminates the license agreement and allows us to recover 
the mgm name so that disney is precluded from using it in florida 
or anywhere else in the world miller said 
miller added that disney has used the name for at least two 
years and owes mgmua compensation for use of the mgm name 
he said mgmua is seeking substantial compensatory and 
punitive damages but he did not specify an amount 
a trial date for the case is expected to be set within six to 
nine months miller said

texas billionaire harold c simmons said 
friday he may seek control of lockheed corps board of directors 
after the defense contractor rebuffed his request for 
representation 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission an 
investment group headed by simmonscontrolled nl industries inc 
disclosed it had raised its stake in lockheed to 189 percent 
ron meder a spokesman for calabasas califbased lockheed 
said the defense contractor had not yet seen a copy of nls filing 
and could not comment until it had 
in the sec filing the investment group said simmons met with 
lockheed chairman daniel m tellep on wednesday 
mr simmons requested that nl be allowed to obtain significant 
minority representation on lockheeds board and that lockheeds 
preferred share purchase rights takeover defense be redeemed 
according to the document filed in washington 
tellep rejected both requests the document stated adding 
mr simmons said he would have to consider a range of options 
including seeking board representation mr tellep said he had no 
concerns about a proxy contest 
a proxy contest is an attempt by a person or group to take over 
a company or jettison its management by obtaining enough proxies 
the legal authority to exercise a shareholders vote to influence 
a corporate election 
in light of the response the filing said simmons and nl 
intend to consider their options including but not limited to 
securing representation on or control of the companys board 
lockheed later issued a statement quoting tellep as confirming 
the meeting with simmons and adding that the investor had offered 
no plans or proposals for the company beyond his requests 
in our meeting mr simmons provided no basis whatsoever for 
us to determine his intentions with respect to the company or 
whether his interests would be consistent with those of lockheed 
and its other shareholders tellep stated 
according to the filing the simmonsled group already 
lockheeds largest stockholder bought 629000 shares between jan 
16 and jan 23 at prices ranging from 3938 and 3975 per share 
in recent months he steadily has increased his holdings in 
lockheed developer of the stealth jet fighter plane from 625 
percent to 169 percent in december 
after simmons initial purchase of lockheed stock was revealed 
in april lockheed created an employee stock ownership plan holding 
about 17 percent of the companys outstanding shares in an attempt 
to make a takeover more difficult 
the meeting with tellep is at least the second between the two 
executives in a previous filing with the sec simmons said he met 
with tellep on may 15 in addition he wrote the lockheed executive 
saying we view lockheed as a wellmanaged company we have no 
plans or desire to disrupt management we expect to be a 
constructive longterm shareholder 
earlier this week simmons who has holdings in the chemical 
timber and sugar industries announced plans for a 11 billion 
tender offer for georgia gulf corp 
the dallas billionaire was not available when phoned on friday 
in an interview last september however he said the 
fundamentals of lockheed are not good theyre deteriorating i 
think defense budgets are going to be cut in real terms fairly 
consistently for several years 
simmons latest move came as his nl industries reported sharply 
lower fourthquarter earnings partly because of the interest on 
loans used to buy stock earnings in the three months ended dec 31 
totaled 204 million or 31 cents a share vs 471 million or 71 
cents a share in the same 1988 period sales increased from 2354 
million to 2394 million 
for the year nls earnings totaled 1729 million or 262 per 
share on sales of 1 billion vs 1629 million or 245 a share 
on 101 billion in sales

robert bass in a governmentassisted deal on friday reported hefty 
earnings of 2142 million for fiscal 1989 
assets which were 154 billion when a group led by bass bought 
american in december 1988 rose by a modest 6 percent to 163 
billion at the close of december 1989 return on assets was a

in assets

loan originations totaled 29 billion during 1989 mainly in 
residential mortgages of that amount 26 billion were 
adjustablerate loans providing american some protection from any 
sharp increase in interest rates 
today american savings is a stable profitable financial 
institution that meets all of the new more stringent capital 
requirements without benefit of regulatory forebearances 
american chairman mario j antoci said in a statement friday 
the tougher standards for capital the cash cushion against 
risk were imposed as part of last years legislation bailing out 
the insurance fund for the thrift industry 
american was part of financial corp of america when it ran into 
huge losses on real estate and a run on deposits in the mid1980s 
under charles w knapp who was later replaced by regulators 
a group led by bass acquired the ailing thrift from regulators 
in december 1988 in a 17 billion deal that split the troubled

federal regulators on friday sold the 
insolvent bright banc savings association of dallas to an ohio bank 
holding company in the largest thrift sale since enactment of the 
sampl bailout law in august 
banc one corp of columbus ohio is receiving 11 billion in 
government assistance to acquire bright banc founded in the early 
1980s by hr bum bright once one of the 50 wealthiest men in 
the country and the former owner of the dallas cowboys football 
team banc one is paying 45 million 
bright banc with 31 billion in assets is the biggest failed 
thrift in texas and the largest yet sold by the resolution trust 
corp 
the deal is one of the first in which the rtc has persuaded the 
buyer to take a substantial portion of the thrifts loans and other 
assets banc one is getting 17 billion of the sampls assets 
including residential mortgages consumer loans cash and 
securities 
the rtc is keeping 14 billion in assets mostly sour loans and 
repossessed real estate after it sells the assets it estimates 
the governments total loss on the institution will be 14 
billion including the 11 billion paid to the ohio company 
rtc officials had promised a major sale after undergoing a 
tonguelashing earlier this week from members of the senate banking 
committee upset with the slow pace of the administrations sampl 
cleanup 
the agency has taken over more than 350 failed thrifts 
disposing of 43 of them but in most of the transactions it has 
simply transferred the failed institutions deposits to the new 
owner and retained the assets for later sale 
bank one texas a unit of the ohio holding company is assuming 
all 26 billion of bright bancs deposits in 250000 accounts the 
thrifts 48 offices will remain open during their usual business 
hours 
the acquisition gives bank one texas a formidable retail network 
in texas it would add bright bancs branches to the 63 it 
currently operates and create a combined institution with about 14 
billion in assets among the 25 largest banking operations in the 
nation 
the rtc did not name the other bidders but said it received a 
total of five including banc ones one other bank two sampls and 
one nonfinancial institution 
banc one first ventured into texas in june with the purchase of 
20 failed banks formerly owned by dallasbased mcorp getting an 
estimated 2 billion in federal aid 
the ohio company ranked among the top handful of most 
profitable banks in the nation has a reputation as a pioneer in 
retail banking it was one of the first banks to offer automated 
teller machines and it has been a leader in packaging obligations 
owed by credit card holders into securities for sale to investors 
bright banc was created in the consolidation of three smaller 
sampls and invested aggressively in texas commercial real estate it 
got into trouble when property values began to decline following 
the 1986 collapse of oil prices 
the thrift was seized by the government on feb 8 only two days 
after bush announced his bailout plan and was put up for bid aug 
30 
william c ferguson a financial institutions consultant in 
irving texas said most of bright bancs problems were caused by 
loans made before the consolidation 
he said bright banc operated much like a commercial bank had a 
strong operation in credit cards and other consumer services and 
predicted it would mesh well with banc one 
i really think it will put together the first retail 
powerhouse that can compete on a level playing field with ncnb i 
think banc one will be suprised at how little problem they have 
assimilating that organization into theirs he said 
ncnb corp of charlotte nc acquired texas largest bank 
first republicbank corp of dallas in july 1988 in the largest 
ever federal bank rescue 
bancone could not make it with only mcorp it didnt give them 
enough of a market share said bert ely a financial institutions 
analyst in alexandria va my sense is this will not be the 
last transaction in texas involving banc one
