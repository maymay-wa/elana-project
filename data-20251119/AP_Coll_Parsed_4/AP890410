in a costcutting move defense minister valerio 
zanone has decided to cancel the annual military parade on italys 
constitution day 
zanone said he believed a ceremony at the recently reopened 
altar of the nation which is also known as the victor emmanuel 
monument would be a more appropriate way to mark the june 4 
holiday 
he said saturday that the decision was prompted by the need to 
cut spending in anticipation of cuts in the defense budget the 
government is trying to cut spending to deal with a projected 1989 
budget deficit of 896 billion 
instead of a military parade this years holiday will be marked 
by wreath placing ceremony at the altar of the nation by president 
francesco cossiga historical and military exhibits and band

leaders of the black hills gold rush town 
where wild bill hickok was gunned down in an 1876 poker game are 
betting a little gambling will restore the local economy by 
reviving the spirit of the old west 
voters decide tuesday whether to allow poker blackjack and slot 
machines in their community of 2000 known a century ago as the 
wildest wickedest town on the western frontier 
at the 85yearold franklin hotel on main street owner bill 
walsh talked about how deadwood might secure its future by 
promoting its past particularly the story of wild bill whose 
bronzed bust guards the hotel lobby 
the us marshal and frontiersman was shot in the back of the 
head during a poker game at a saloon called no 10 on aug 2 1876 
legend has it he was clutching a pair each of aces and eights 
everafter known by card players as the dead mans hand 
i think that deadwoods identity as far as a tourism type of 
destination area has always been tied to wild bill hickok and that 
shooting walsh said when people come to deadwood they expect 
the old west 
a bit of a betting boom might stop the towns decadelong 
economic decline by creating jobs to draw young people back 
supporting services for the elderly and helping to make deadwood a 
center for the arts he said mayor tom blair estimated gaming 
might generate 500000 a year for historic restoration 
we want to give that impression of an old western mining town 
in 1889 walsh said while were trying to go forward 
economically were going to the past to give us that boost 
but some deadwood residents oppose the gambling plan which they 
doubt will provide much of an economic boost 
there is opposition here in town and its asically on moral 
grounds said the rev don hadrick of the united methodist 
church adding that opponents have been too intimidated by the 
overwhelming support to make much noise its not popular to be 
in the minority on issues such as this 
blair predicted the gambling limited to 5 bets and 15 games 
for each establishment would attract at least another 200000 
tourists to deadwood each year mostly vacationing families 
interested in black hills recreation 
if you want the glitz and glitter of atlantic city or the 
glamorous entertainmemt of las vegas youve come to the wrong 
place blair said we want the gambling to augment what we are 
year round a beautiful part of south dakota with lots of things 
for people to do both summer and winter 
until last year south dakotas constitution forbade all games 
of chance except the state lottery and games for charitable 
religious educational or publicspirited purposes 
the deadwood you bet committee made up mostly of local 
officials and business owners has been trying since 1985 to start 
limited gambling the effort paid off in november when voters 
statewide approved a constitutional amendment allowing the 
legislature to authorize limited gambling in deadwood 
lawmakers gave the goahead a month ago but gambling can only 
begin if 60 percent of deadwood voters approve it tuesday about 70 
percent favored the constitutional amendment in november and a 
recent telephone survey of 900 of deadwoods 1200 registered 
voters confirmed widespread support blair said 
deadwood was founded on a desire for wealth and adventure an 
1876 gold strike in deadwood gulch brought 7000 people to the area 
in seven months as deadwood grew so did its reputation as the 
rowdiest mining town of them all 
sodom and gomorrah were both dull stupid towns compared with 
deadwood author jw buel wrote in an 1886 book called heroes 
of the plains in a square contest for the honors of moral 
depravity the black hills capital could give the people of the 
dead sea cities three points in the game and then skunk them both 
town leaders hope the limited gambling will recall the towns 
past without any of the lawlessness if gambling is approved the 
next 20 years will see the restoration of deadwoods buildings and 
other facilities the mayor said 
i would hope that as you step back onto main street that 
you really see youre stepping back 100 years in time

the bestkept secret at the topsecret 
savannah river nuclear weapons site is the expanse of wilderness 
that is home to two endangered species along with alligators fish 
and other wildlife 
the governmentowned nature preserve coexists with the giant 
reactors that when operating produce key components for the 
nations nuclear weapons 
alligators glide through mistshrouded swamp waters redbreast 
sunfish ply the blackwater streams yellow rat snakes slither up 
longneedle pine trees 
the tranquility of nature barely a stones throw from the 
reactors seems out of synch with the nature of the work that goes 
on at the savannah river site 
a lot of people think it must be desolate but its not in 
some ways its thriving said frances close hart head of the 
columbia scbased energy research foundation a strong critic of 
the plants nuclear production activities 
public attention to the savannah river site situated just south 
of this small city has focused on the safety of the three 
reactors the concrete structures each casting identical profiles 
against the wooded backdrop are the nations only source of 
tritium which is needed to make nuclear warheads the reactors 
have been shut down for nearly a year and feverish work is under 
way to get them back in operation 
two endangered species can be found on the grounds the wood 
stork and the redcockaded woodpecker plus the protected american 
alligator which recently was taken off the national endangered 
species list but is still considered threatened 
animals and plant life at the site are studied by teams of 
scientists from the onsite savannah river ecology laboratory 
which is run by the university of georgia under contract with the 
us department of energy 
michael smith the labs director said in an interview that the 
sites status as a highsecurity area isolated from the public 
makes it a unique outdoor laboratory in 1972 the site was 
designated a national environmental research park 
its a large area where animals can be free of human 
interference he said 
the reactors were built in the early 1950s and are situated near 
the center of the circularshaped federal reservation which abuts 
the savannah river and the georgia border on its southwestern edge 
the site encompasses 300 square miles about equal in size to new 
york city and is 17 miles across at its widest point 
much has changed in the four decades since the government took 
over the land 
cotton fields that once dotted the land are gone in their 
place are vast stretches of loblolly pine trees that the us 
forest service harvests and replants in an operation that site 
officials say earns 2 million a year for the treasury 
whole towns have disappeared among them is ellington whose 
residents were uprooted to enable the government to isolate the 
weapons complex from the civilian population some former residents 
today live in new ellington just outside the site boundary 
stretches of cyprus and tupelo trees have been killed off by 
the effects of heated water discharged from the reactors cooling 
system into creeks that feed the swamplands 
with the cypruses went the spotted sunfish that inhabited the 
treelined swamps smith said in their place now are redbreast 
sunfish and dramatically higher numbers of mosquito fish which 
thrive on the altered vegetation he said 
scientists on the site are still studying the effects on 
wildlife from the reactors hotwater discharges smith said 
adding it is not a settled issue 
but on balance smith says the presence of radioactivity and 
toxic wastes has not hurt the sites wildlife and ecosystem the 34 
million gallons of highlevel solid waste are placed in yellow 
steel boxes buried in trenches and covered with four feet of soil 
in general the animals have benefited smith said many 
because they are isolated from human predators 
the american alligator population for example has prospered 
its numbers in park pond a manmade lake into which hot water from 
the reactor is discharged have almost doubled over the past 10 
years to about 400 smith said 
whitetailed deer which numbered fewer than 100 in the early 
1950s have multiplied so quickly that a limited number of local 
residents are brought onto the site for a hunt once a year the 
deer population has been stabilized at about 2500 smith said 
ms hart said that while animals on the site may be faring well 
her group is concerned about the radiation that ducks and some 
other wildlife may carry off the site 
its the impact not on the animals but on the humans that eat 
them that is the problem she said adding that offsite health 
studies have not been conclusive

former sen j william fulbright says the 
federal government has been so weakened by bickering and stalemate 
that the time has come for radical surgery on the constitution 
fulbrights solution move away from the constitutions system 
of checks and balances and separation of powers and move toward 
parliamentary democracy 
the suggestion comes from a former longtime chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee well known for his pitched 
battles with the white house over the vietnam war 
the arkansas democrat now a washington attorney acknowledges 
he is taking on a sacred cow 
we have come to regard our constitutional system as we regard 
the bible fulbright says in a new book the price of empire 
published by pantheon books 
like the chinese emperor of old our presidential office if 
not the presidents themselves is perceived as invested with the 
mandate of heaven he writes it is a matter of blind faith 
not common sense 
as diagnosed by fulbright a senator from 1945 until his 1974 
defeat the problem is serious and getting worse 
our political system is functioning very poorly today he 
says it is proving almost impossible either to seriously debate 
an important issue or to arrive at a consensus on how to handle it 
we have celebrated our system of checks and balances for so 
long that we now ignore the ways in which it weakens our government 
with a dynamic of adversarial relationships that frustrates any 
coherent policy 
as fulbright sees it the executive branch is kept in check by 
congress and congress is kept in check by the executive branch a 
situation that becomes worse when one party controls the white 
house and another controls the congress 
the inevitable result is acute bickering polemical stalemate 
and governmental paralysis fulbright says 
a case in point the inability in recent years to agree on a 
budget or on ways to reduce or end the budget deficit 
i suggest that the perpetuation of the resulting situation and 
our inability to correct it is to a great extent due to the rivalry 
between executive and legislature that is inherent in our system of 
separation of the powers of government fulbright says 
fulbright contends that the separation of those powers coupled 
with the diversity of the american people the decline of the 
political party system and the growth of special interests blocks 
orderly and productive government 
in practice the separation of powers does not protect the 
interests of the community or of the individual citizen on the 
contrary it subjects them to exploitation by the special 
interests he contends 
echoing the complaint of many foreign leaders fulbright says 
the divided nature of the american government under the 
constitution makes it all but impossible for a president to make an 
ironclad foreign policy commitment 
when the prime minister of a parliamentary democracy signs on 
the dotted line you can be sure in most instances that the 
agreement is going to be approved he says you cannot be sure 
under our system 
congress can block most agreements signed by the president 
fulbright notes 
and he says a failure of the american system lies in the 
inability of congress to end debate after a reasonable period and 
reach a final decision 
the result he says is a perpetual tugofwar in which 
presidents over time become isolated and arbitrary and congress 
becomes quarrelsome and increasingly irrelevant 
the attractiveness of a parliamentary system lies in part in 
the ability of parliament to call a prime minister before it for 
direct intense headtohead questioning and confrontation 
fulbright contends 
as the american system is constructed he says no president 
ever has to explain his views in detail or reconcile them with 
criticisms or suggestions made by others 
fulbrights solution divide the country into 535 districts 
representing the current 100 senators and 435 house members and 
hold elections for a national onehouse congress or parliament 
in this highly democratic fashion we could choose a 
representative congress or parliament from whose number a 
president or prime minister would then be chosen in precisely the 
same manner in which presidents of wellrun corporations or 
universities are chosen by peer review he says 
had such a system been in place over the last several decades 
fulbright says there would have been a betterthaneven chance 
that such legislative leaders as former senate republican leader 
howard h baker or the late sen richard b russell dga would 
have been chosen prime minister

environmentalists who just a few months ago 
had high hopes of finding an ally in president bush are beginning 
to complain that his proenvironment promises contained more 
rhetoric than substance 
the honeymoon isnt over but i think were in a shaky 
period jack lorenz president of the isaak walton league said 
last week as the leaders of nine environmental groups held a news 
conference to chastise bush for several personnel appointments and 
the governments response to the alaska oil spill 
clearly weve got problems on our hands and it looks like a 
long siege is at hand said michael mccloskey chairman of the 
sierra club other environmental leaders said that aside from the 
appointment of william reilly a lifelong conservationist as head 
of the environmental protection agency they have had little to 
cheer about 
environmentalists concede there have been some pluses other than 
the reilly appointment a decision contrary to the reagan 
administration to work aggressively for revisions in federal clean 
air laws including provisions to combat acid rain a decision to 
push internationally for 100 percent elimination of 
chlorofluorocarbons blamed for depleting highaltitude ozone 
reillys intervention in building the two forks dam in colorado 
and a promise to review three offshore drilling plans near 
california and the florida everglades 
but the complaints have been loud over several critical 
subcabinet nominations by bush involving posts close to 
environmentalists hearts the administrations continued overall 
support of new oil exploration particularly in the alaska national 
wildlife refuge and the response to the oil tanker accident in 
alaskas prince william sound 
they complained that bush hasnt moved quickly enough to take 
control of the oil spill cleanup away from the exxon corp whose 
tanker ran aground and tore open march 24 spilling more than 10 
million gallons of crude 
george frampton president of the wilderness society noted that 
three national parks are in the oils path it is the federal 
governments responsibility to prevent this damage he said 
mr president this is your boston harbor declared roger 
mcmanus president of the center for marine conservation pollution 
in boston harbor became a campaign issue last year as bush sought 
to gain an edge on environmental issues over democrat michael 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts 
the president acknowledged last friday that exxons efforts were 
inadequate and said the us coast guard would take increased 
control of the cleanup but critics suggested that assessment was 
far too slow in coming from the white house 
but the controversy over the oil spill is not all that has 
widened the gulf between the president and the environmentalists 
the major environmental and conservation groups had hoped bush 
would reverse the reagan administration conclusion that oil 
development should with congressional approval proceed in the 
alaska national wildlife refuge the president has refused to do so 
and declares that he sees no link to drilling in the refuge and the 
alaska spill 
personnel decisions also have riled environmental groups most 
notably the nomination of james cason as an assistant secretary of 
agriculture overseeing the us forest service 
as a senior interior department official in the reagan 
administration cason was accused of consistently taking a 
prodevelopment stand on public lands issues and being the 
architect of various efforts in recent years favoring mining and 
oil interests 
cason as well as several other officials already nominated or 
about to be nominated to senior posts at interior once worked for 
interior secretary james watt who was broadly attacked as being 
insensitive to environmental concerns 
these personnel actions blow a huge hole in the presidents 
claim to be an environmentalists said gaylord nelson the former 
wisconsin senator and now counsel for the wilderness society it 
is clear that the house that watt built is still standing instead 
of being torn down its receiving a new paint job 
bushs interior secretary manuel lujan jr a former 
congressman from new mexico also has raised eyebrows in the 
environmental and conservation communities 
in one interview he suggested that economic concerns should be 
taken into consideration when deciding when wildlife should be 
declared an endangered species a position environmentalists say 
represents a sharp change in the interpretation of the endangered 
species act 
lujan also has been criticized for suggesting that there are 
few if any instances of public lands harmed by excessive grazing 
a comment that prompted the national wildlife federation to send 
him a letter citing various studies that have raised concerns about 
grazing abuses on lands managed by the interior department

the last national newspaper on fleet street once 
londons rumbustious newspaper row has made its final press run 
there with british journalism trading the typewriters clatter for 
the quiet of high technology 
behind the gleaming black glass facade of the art deco express 
building reporters editors and technicians crated the contents of 
desks packed up their memories and sent off the final fleet 
street edition of the sunday express before moving to new 
headquarters 
when the last bundle of papers was tied up sunday and dispatched 
around the country all was silent where for decades typewriters 
clacked linotype machines rattled and presses hummed 
express newspapers group is moving only a few hundred yards 
across the river thames to a new 10story building with computers 
and other modern newspaper technology 
but the site is a million spiritual miles from the noisy 
exuberance of fleet street 89 years ago when the daily express was 
the new kid on the block the sunday express was founded by lord 
beaverbrook in 1918 and its celebrated building went up in 1931 
the british are avid newspaper readers for nearly 300 years 
the countrys national papers were all published on or near fleet 
street the short crowded street and adjoining warren of alleys 
and hidden courtyards were abuzz around the clock with journalists 
rushing to meet deadlines 
the national newspapers have moved away one by one to 
computerized facilities since publisher rupert murdoch began the 
exodus in 1986 that year his four newspapers the times the 
sunday times the sun and the news of the world moved to the 
developing docklands breaking the hold of unions fighting 
hightechnology encroachments on their jobs 
the reuters and press association news agencies will remain at 
their fleet street headquarters some of the last representatives 
of the british journalists who made fleet street synonymous with 
news 
for express journalists the changes will be dramatic 
a lot of the processes were using here tonight were much the 
same as they were in the 1930s news editor henry macrory said 
saturday night as the final edition went to bed it was very much 
typewriters and pretty old typewriters at that 
there are crates thousands of them i should think in every 
office packed up with all the clutter were taking across with us 
telephone books old contacts books stories youve kept all the 
mementos of fleet street 
the old express building has been bought by the guardian 
exchange group and a japanese property developer for 136 million 
they plan to use it as an office building but its black and chrome 
facade will be remain in place under a historic preservation order 
in the express building nicknamed the black lubyanka after 
the soviet kgb complex sunday express editor robin esser said his 
own goodbye saturday night 
we bid farewell to the black lubyanka tonight farewell to a 
500year tradition in the most famous home of journalism fleet 
street but we will always be fleet street journalists 
the last edition of the broadsheet from the old plant carries a 
brief farewell that reminds readers of fleet streets nicknames 
grub street and street of shame 
but we were never ashamed of it or not often the

a bulky report that exposes greed graft 
and arrogance among top politicians outlines the first major 
scandal to rock president robert mugabes 9yearold government 
but mugabe is getting kudos for allowing the probe to take place 
at all 
the reports authors are judge wilson sandura and two prominent 
civilians who sat for more than two months in harares high court 
packed by spectators who enjoyed seeing their leaders squirm under 
interrogation 
some 60 witnesses testified and even before the report was sent 
to mugabe two cabinet ministers quit their government and party 
posts after being caught lying to the panel 
the usually timid statecontrolled media demanded punishment for 
some of the other luminaries summoned before the commission among 
them six cabinet ministers two junior ministers several civil 
servants and the army commander 
while the probe identified corruption in the party hierarchy it 
also won mugabe praise for ordering some of his staunchest aides to 
face the embarrassment of being quizzed in public 
this could never happen anywhere else in black africa said 
a west african diplomat 
the daily nation an independent newspaper in kenyas capital of 
nairobi praised mugabe for his openness and suggested that a 
corruption probe in africa is as rare as rain in the sahara 
in a continent where contemporary politicians often behave like 
autocratic tribal chiefs of old scores of zimbabweans crowded into 
the courtroom to snigger sneer and jeer at the vips on the witness 
stand 
when higher education minister dzingai mutumbuka refused under 
crossexamination to produce bank statements the public gallery 
erupted into laughter and booing 
angered the minister pointed at the hecklers pounded the box 
and shouted one fool at a time please 
the probe that shook the nation involved the purchase of cars 
and trucks from the willowvale assembly plant by ministers and 
their friends at low fixed prices 
the commission investigated allegations that some top officials 
used their influence to jump waiting lines for vehicles and then 
resold the cars on the black market for up to five times what they 
paid 
zimbabwe independent from britain only since april 18 1980 
has suffered a dire shortage of cars because of a lack of hard 
currency wouldbe buyers can wait up to 10 years for a new vehicle 
but the cabinet last year decided to give some government 
officials the right to buy one vehicle each at the fixed state 
price 
one senior minister admitted to the investigating panel that he 
had helped 38 friends buy cars but he insisted he had not taken a 
penny in return 
army commander tapfumaneyi mujuru conceded he had bought a car 
and sold it at a profit of about 2500 
charges against those allegedly involved could range from price 
control violations and sales tax evasion which usually bring 
nominal fines to perjury which carries a maximum prison sentence 
of five years 
meanwhile the crusading newspaper editor who lifted the veil on 
willowgate geoff nyarota has disappeared from public view and 
is staying mum 
officially nyarota was transferred from the chronicle in 
bulawayo zimbabwes secondlargest city to a public relations job 
at the harare headquarters of zimbabwe newspapers ltd the 
statecontrolled group that owns most of the countrys papers 
but many readers are convinced the editors move to a post that 
previously did not exist was the result of pressure from above 
they recall that nyarota was threatened with detention by defense 
minister enos nkala before the minister resigned in the midst of 
the commission probe 
many zimbabweans fear the silencing of nyarota could mean that 
future scandals might be hushed up 
but mugabe has promised the probe report will be made public in 
its entirety after he has finished reading it

organizers of the abortion rights march on the 
nations capitol fumed at a police estimate that put their crowd of 
supporters at only 300000 
we arent going to let them deny us our numbers said 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority and 
one of the march organizers who claim more than 600000 people 
turned out for sundays rally 
both estimates showed the demonstration was larger than the 
approximately 250000 people organizers had predicted would turn 
out but still supporters felt cheated by the police estimate 
this was no ordinary march we took over the city smeal 
said during the rally that closed down the streets around the 
capitol and the mall and flooded the west side of the capitol with 
activists 
she suggested that bush administration politics were at play 
noting that the us park police one of three law enforcement 
authorities involved in making the estimate report to the white 
house 
they always lowball our numbers she added 
smeal said march organizers which included the national 
organization for women and planned parenthood consulted with 
architectural and landscape engineers in coming up with their 
figure of 600000 
the 300000 estimate was made jointly by the us park police 
which has jurisdiction over federal property the us capitol 
police whose force covers the capitol grounds and the district of 
columbia metropolitan police who cover city properties 
the three police agencies are very good at estimating crowds 
because we do it so often said dan nichols a spokesman for the 
capitol police 
he and michael braxton a spokesman for the park police 
dismissed suggestions that their count was politically motivated 
all we do is give an accurate count braxton said 
explaining that in this march as in most large rallies officers 
view the crowd from helicopters and then estimate the size based on 
grid maps which divide the area into sections 
it doesnt make any difference to us how many turn out 
nichols said we dont have anything to gain or lose 
he added that rally organizers invariably dispute police crowd 
estimates but he said that because sundays march was so large 
it leaves more room for a gap

mothers daughters and even granddaughters 
took their places in the massive march on the nations capitol as 
generations joined the show of solidarity for a womans right to 
choose an abortion 
norma melbourne who took her daughter dylan to the womens

daughter and her 2yearold granddaughter honore ford at sundays 
demonstration that attracted more than 300000 from the washington

we have taken it for granted that they had choices said 
norma melbourne 
she recalled stories of little places in pennsylvania and 
mexico where women had to go to obtain abortions before the 
supreme court decision in roe vs wade in 1973 
patricia rocket 61 of lewes del also has heard the stories 
of backalley abortions and brought her 81yearold mother evelyn 
pope to protest any possible change in the law 
it scares me to death to think of going back to before roe vs 
wade rocket said 
nearby ella byrnes also 81 of muncie ind raised a homemade 
sign which said indiana republicans for choice and in smaller 
letters claimed that former president reagan was prochoice 
my mother was in a class ahead of reagans at eureka 
college said barbara maves who said that reagan as president 
of the student council was a big supporter of individual rights 
the republican philosophy is basically individual rights 
said nancy grundmann of kokomo ind who left her home at 4 am 
saturday to make the march i wanted the rest of the united 
states to know many republicans are prochoice

progress seems agonizingly slow in the war 
on cancer but scientists are seeking small gains on many fronts to 
turn the tide against the nations no 2 killer 
the major breakthroughs in cancer are few and far between and 
have taken place over decades said dr harold freeman president 
of the american cancer society 
still he said progress has been remarkable 
in 1930 one of five us cancer patients had survived five 
years in 1988 nearly 50 percent did 
the society expects cancer the uncontrolled growth and spread 
of abnormal cells to kill 502000 americans this year 
cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke claim 
nearly 1 million americans yearly 
critics have called the war on cancer a failure because overall 
cancer incidence and death rates keep rising even when statistics 
are corrected for the increasing percentage of cancerprone older 
citizens they say inadequate attention is paid to prevention 
including reduction of carcinogenic pollutants 
with cigaretteinduced lung cancer responsible for much of the 
average rise in cancer death rates people have to stop smoking 
and take advantage of early detection techniques and the latest 
treatments said national cancer institute spokesman j paul van 
nevel 
nevertheless he said research has put america on the verge 
of seeing the advances everyone has hoped for 
many recent advances were outlined here last week at the cancer 
societys annual seminar for science writers among them 
an early version of a test that someday might be used to 
determine individual vulnerability to cancercausing substances has 
been developed by dr margaret spitz and others at the university 
of texas the test indicates how easily a persons basic genetic 
information can be damaged by carcinogens 
a national centers for disease control study showed xray 
mammograms can be used to identify women who face an increased risk 
of breast cancer not just to detect such tumors once they appear 
the two studies suggest new ways for doctors to identify people 
facing a high cancer risk educate them to reduce cancercausing 
behavior such as smoking and closely monitor them to detect cancer 
early enough for treatment 
a major research effort involves tumor suppressor genes or 
antioncogenes which are genetic instructions that serve 
natures mechanism for stopping cancer cells before they get 
started the society said 
research shows genetic instructions from a normal cell can 
return a cancer cell to normalcy said chemist j carl barrett of 
the national institute of environmental health sciences that 
suggests human cancers someday might be halted or reversed with 
massproduced antioncogenes 
a major problem with chemotherapy is that many patients 
initially helped become resistant to the cancerkilling drugs so 
their cancer returns and kills them dr william dalton of the 
university of arizona temporarily reversed resistance in certain 
patients by using a drug that helps keep chemotherapy drugs inside 
tumor cells 
chemotherapy also may be improved with drugs that attack 
cancers more precisely on a biochemical level indiana universitys 
dr george weber is testing a drug that counteracts a 
cancerpromoting enzyme it caused remission of leukemia in half a 
small group of patients for whom all other chemotherapy failed 
larger doses of chemotherapy kill more cancer cells but damage 
patients ability to make blood cells needed to prevent 
lifethreatening infections 
dr janice gabrilove of new yorks memorial sloankettering 
cancer center combined chemotherapy with a substance called gcsf 
she found the combination allowed bladder cancer patients to 
tolerate highdose chemotherapy while suffering fewer infections 
another approach to the problem is to remove bone marrow then 
reimplant it after highdose radiation and chemotherapy dr robert 
marcus jr of the university of florida at gainesville found the 
risky procedure nearly triples the 20 percent survival rate of 
patients with a rare bone cancer 
national cancer institute biochemist david segal said 
researchers are removing tumorfighting white blood cells from 
cancer patients linking the cells to monoclonal antibodies 
then injecting them back into the patients 
the method combines the antibodies ability to track down cancer 
cells with the white blood cells ability to kill cancer segal 
said the method blocks cancer growth in mice and is being tested 
on humans with ovarian cancer and one type of brain tumor 
the institutes dr charles evans is using a substance called 
leukoregulin to make tumor cell membranes more permeable thereby 
making the cancers more vulnerable to chemotherapy and the bodys 
own immune system cells 
biochemist brian ross of the huntington medical research 
institute in pasadena is using a method called magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy to look for changes in brain chemistry that accompany 
brain tumor growth he said the method can allow doctors to monitor 
chemotherapys effectiveness and possibly detect the earliest 
stages of a new tumor in time to treat it

vastly outnumbered but undeterred several 
hundred foes of abortion prayed and sang hymns in a symbolic 
cemetery on the washington mall as hundreds of thousands of 
abortion rights activists marched past 
the mood inside the rustred snowfence bounding the cemetery 
of the innocents was one of quiet devotion sunday as 
antiabortion activists knelt amid 4400 white wooden crosses and 
stars of david the number of unborn they said are aborted every 
day 
but emotions sometimes ran high at the edge of the fence where 
several women held up enlarged color photographs of fetuses 
i want people to see the other side this is what they are 
choosing when they choose abortions said susan brimmer of 
columbia md 
a number of abortion rights activists as they marched past the 
cemetery to the capitol shouted prochoice and other slogans 
but moved away when bluehelmeted police asked them to avoid 
confrontation 
about 200 to 300 antiabortion protesters gathered in pockets 
elsewhere on the parade route displaying placards and trading 
taunts with the marchers police some on horseback kept the 
opposing groups apart 
in one pocket about 50 college men and women stood at the base 
of capitol hill holding up signs proclaiming that abortion may 
be legal but it is not moral and urging the supreme court to 
overturn roe vs wade the decision which has legalized 
abortion since 1973 
one of those women michelle sheahan a student at wellesley 
college said she and 14 other abortion foes from her school rode 
down from massachusetts on buses filled with antiabortion 
activists 
their message she said was that abortion exploits women 
and that no one can decide for the unborn child 
ray allen head of the american coalition for life which built 
the symbolic cemetery said he wanted to communicate the message 
in a graphic way that abortion on demand kills children 
allen who moved to washington from dallas three years ago to 
campaign against abortion said he planned to return to texas soon 
because the battle will be fought in the states 
if the supreme court overturns roe vs wade states likely would 
have the authority to determine whether abortions would be legal 
within their borders 
two women who said they underwent abortions told a news 
conference before the demonstration that they now oppose the 
operation 
i will never forget the dream i had of my baby screaming as 
the doctor ripped that baby from my womb said nora whitten of 
newark texas abortion is murder those involved in abortion 
seem to realize this but try to hide their feelings because they 
are afraid to deal with the truth 
nola jones of vacaville calif said she regrets two abortions 
she had in 1974 and 1977 
i spent eight and one half years in denial destroying myself

a proposed constitutional amendment banning 
abortions remains a longrange goal of the antiabortion movement 
but it is taking a back seat to the battle in the supreme court 
proposals for such an amendment were the main rallying cry of 
the antiabortion movement for years and have been endorsed by both 
president bush and former president reagan 
but bush now says he will probably wait for the supreme courts 
decision before undertaking any antiabortion initiatives and 
reagan is turning to other issues 
an antiabortion amendment was rejected by the senate nearly six 
years ago the proposal has been reintroduced in the house and 
senate but no action is scheduled 
the supreme court however will hear arguments april 26 in a 
case in which the state of missouri the bush administration and 
others seek to limit or reverse the courts 16yearold ruling that 
women have a constitutional right to abortion 
especially in recent years the focus has been much more on 
the court itself and the likelihood of a reversal rather than on 
the much more onerous method of amending the constitution 
douglas johnson legislative director of national right to life 
said in an interview 
the only time an antiabortion amendment has ever been voted 
upon in either house of congress was on june 28 1983 when it 
failed on a 5049 vote in the senate well short of the required 
twothirds majority 
in the house no such measure has ever emerged from the 
judiciary committee which antiabortion leaders say is 
considerably more liberal on the abortion rights issue than the 
house as a whole 
if it received the necessary majority in both houses the 
amendment would still require ratification by threefourths of the 
states before it became part of the constitution 
the amendment that failed in 1983 sponsored by sen orrin g 
hatch rutah would have provided simply a right to abortion is 
not secured by this constitution that would have left it up to 
state legislatures to decide whether to make abortions legal 
the vote came just two weeks after the supreme court had struck 
down a number of state and local limits on abortion in line with 
the reasoning of its 1973 decision known as roe v wade since 
then the courts conservative wing has been strengthened by the 
addition of justices antonin scalia and anthony kennedy 
encouraging abortion foes to believe it may reverse position 
johnson said the high court has reversed itself on major 
constitutional issues about 150 times whereas court rulings have 
been overturned by constitutional amendment only four times on 
issues including the 18year voting age and the constitutionality 
of the income tax 
reagan urged the senate of six years ago to make its voice 
heard against abortion on demand whether by statute or 
constitutional amendment and lobbied senators by telephone on the 
issue 
on his flight to california after leaving office jan 20 he 
listed a change with regard to the abortion situation as among 
the issues he planned to be taking to the people as an 
expresident 
his spokesman mark weinberg said however that the former 
president has not mentioned the abortion amendment in prepared 
speeches he has delivered since leaving office although he has 
plugged a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and 
a lineitem veto for presidents 
i am certain though that as he said on the airplane he will 
discuss that issue in coming months weinberg said by telephone 
from los angeles he has spoken about some issues and will be 
speaking about others 
reagan has endorsed the amendment backed by national right to 
life which would allow abortions only when necessary to save the 
life of the mother bush has said he would broaden the exception to 
include cases of rape and incest 
bush asked on jan 27 whether he planned any new antiabortion 
initiatives or would wait for the supreme court said i think 
probably wait but i have been pledged as you know to an 
amendment but id like to see the supreme court decision as soon 
as possible 
on jan 25 sen jake garn rutah introduced the latest 
version of the antiabortion amendment this amendment more 
farreaching than the one defeated in 1983 would declare the 
unborn to be persons and provide no unborn person shall be 
deprived of life by any person with the exception that it would 
not bar a law permitting only those medical procedures required 
to prevent the death of the mother similar measures have been 
introduced in the house neither the house nor senate judiciary 
committee has scheduled any action 
i frankly do not think that there is any chance with the 
current makeup of congress that a human life amendment would pass 
i dont think it would even get out of committee said nancy 
broff legislative and political director of the national abortion 
rights action league 
johnson said right to life regards such an amendment as our 
long term goal but we would be happy for incremental progress and 
we see overturning roe v wade as a big step toward that goal 
meanwhile one state has adopted an antiabortion constitutional 
amendment arkansas voters approved an amendment in november by a 
margin of 58 to 42 per cent making it state policy to protect 
the life of every unborn child from conception until birth to the 
extent permitted by the federal constitution 
so long as the supreme court interprets the constitution as 
guaranteeing women the right to have abortions the arkansas 
measure cant be applied to prohibit them if the court reverses 
itself action by the state legislature would probably be necessary 
to make them illegal observers in little rock have said arkansas 
laws currently permit abortions so long as they are performed by 
doctors

when the environmental protection agency tried 
to crack down on us government polluters two years ago a justice 
department official was accused of sabotaging the effort and making 
epa the enforcement eunuch of the government 
house members and epa officials directed their criticism at f 
henry habicht ii who now has been recommended by epa administrator 
william k reilly as the agencys no 2 official 
habicht is working as an epa consultant while he waits for 
president bushs nomination as deputy administrator said epa 
spokesman david cohen who described reillys choice as one of 
the brightest and toughest environmental enforcers in town 
habicht 35 admittedly was a key architect in developing the 
justice department policy that forced epa to negotiate with us 
government polluters instead of handing them orders to clean up 
their hazardous waste 
internal epa memos in 198687 called the policy unlawful 
because it was more lenient toward government than private 
polluters and warned the double standard could severely damage 
epas credibility 
epa officials said in interviews last week the policy has 
allowed the defense and energy departments to stonewall 
negotiations involving their facilities thereby delaying 
agreements at some of the nations worst pollution sites 
an epa source speaking only on condition he not be named said 
the practical effect of habichts policy is it takes longer 
than it should to correct violations at federal facilities 
we spend too much time negotiating because theres no order 
that would culminate the negotiating process the source said 
the idea behind orders is that people are not going to screw 
around if they know epa has delegated authority from the president 
to make the decision on what needs to be done 
habicht resigned as the chief of the justice departments land 
and natural resources division in 1987 shortly after his testimony 
before congress on the negotiation policy he has worked since for 
an environmental consulting firm that was headed by former epa 
administrator william d ruckelshaus 
cohen said reilly chose habicht because hes one of the most 
capable environmental managers anyone who knows hank habicht knows 
he is firstrate 
defending habichts actions two years ago cohen said there were 
constitutional problems with epas administrative orders to 
other agencies and habicht has not ruled out administrative 
orders as a possible tool 
it was a strictly legal consideration and i dont think it 
reflects as some would lead you to believe in any way negatively 
on hank habichts determination to get on with the job of federal 
facilities cleanup and also with making sure that federal 
facilities are treated as much as possible as polluters are treated 
in the private sector 
other epa officials also described habicht as a committed 
environmentalist despite his rough treatment in april 1987 when he 
appeared before the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee 
panel chairman john d dingell dmich predicted the 
negotiation policy would make epa the enforcement eunuch of the 
federal agencies and with regard to federal facilities its 
failures and the penalties that will be suffered by the public will 
be noteworthy 
other committee members called the policy a prescription for 
nonenforcement of the countrys environmental laws and said it 
created a double standard between federal agency polluters and 
private industry 
sen quentin n burdick chairman of the senate environment and 
public works committee said the panel is checking into the 
controversy since it would conduct habichts confirmation hearing 
the committee will definitely look into this matter and his 
other work at the justice department if he is nominated 
burdick dnd said i am concerned about the theory which 
limits epas ability to ensure that federal agencies comply with 
federal environmental laws 
a spokesman for sen harry reid dnev a committee member 
said the controversy is extremely disturbing but the 
spokesman craig varoga said reid has an open mind on the 
nomination and has the greatest enthusiasm for providing mr 
reilly with all the proper support he needs

most australians do not care that prime 
minister bob hawke has been unfaithful to his wife and he gained no 
political advantage from the tearful confession on television 
according to a poll published today 
the survey published in the sydney morning herald newspaper 
was the first major poll on the matter 
some critics had suggested that hawkes tearyeyed admission 
during an interview on national television on march 21 was a 
calculated ploy to win votes for his governing australian labor 
party 
but 70 percent of those questioned in a random national 
telephone survey of 1000 people were indifferent one in four 
thought less of hawke after the confession and 5 percent thought 
more of him according to the survey 
the poll was conducted by irving saulwick amp associates from 
april 35 and has a 3 percent margin of error 
during the tv interview hawke said his wife hazel had 
understood his infidelity and that he still loved her 
the couple celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary two weeks 
before the interview in which hawke also spoke of his past 
drinking habits 
commenting on the poll results the herald said do 
australians put their leaders on a pedestal of morality it would 
seem not

the united states should pursue a cautious 
strategy toward the soviet union tempering new initiatives with 
skepticism about president mikhail gorbachevs intentions 
president bushs national security adviser says 
brent scowcroft maintained on sunday that the western strategy 
of projecting strength and determination in dealings with the 
kremlin has been successful he cited gorbachevs withdrawal from 
afghanistan and indications the soviet economic system is in 
trouble 
at the same time both scowcroft and secretary of state james a 
baker iii acknowledged in national television interviews that bush 
administration officials remain immersed in a substantial 
interagency review of eastwest relations 
scowcroft labeled as premature published reports saying bush 
already had been advised by a policy task force to pursue a 
basically statusquo policy toward the soviets 
we have initial results from the study by the bureaucratic 
interagency process he said on nbctvs meet the press but 
scowcroft said its probably not surprising that the future looks 
a lot like the present in a sort of straightline projection but 
were not there yet 
baker interviewed on abcs this week with david brinkley 
brushed aside complaints by gorbachev that the goslow us policy 
stance has jeopardized momentum for agreement on a treaty to slash 
the superpowers strategic nuclear stockpiles 
we are conducting a policy review baker said we have 
told the soviets as long ago as a month that we anticipated 
that these reviews would be completed about the end of april 
he also said he would be prepared to discuss some of these 
issues during his scheduled meeting in moscow in early may with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
so theyve known what our time frame and timetable was for 
quite some time baker said so its sort of interesting to see 
this statement only coming out now 
scowcroft a retired air force general was asked to comment on 
reports that bush had been advised to steer a cautious course 
toward the soviets and to be wary of gorbachevs promises of reform 
in russia 
a major power like the united states ought not to make sharp 
dramatic changes in policy he said weve had a fairly 
consistent policy now through democratic and republican 
administrations for 40 years a lot of things are happening 
and its important now perhaps for the first administration in a 
long time to look out ahead to look toward the end of the 
century and say where do we want to be 
theres no question that we have every reason to look back on 
the past 40 years and say weve been successful scowcroft added 
an administration official discussing the internal policy 
review on grounds of anonymity said the initial policy report 
advised bush to pursue no major new initiatives 
bush asked his advisers to take another look another time at 
the whole situation after receiving recommendations on relations 
with the soviet union eastern europe and eastwest relations the 
official said three such reports are part of a major foreign 
policy review bush initiated as he took office in january 
in relations with the soviet union i dont see anything 
new the official said adding that there apparently was not 
much to change right now the reports were given to bush during 
meetings of the national security council over the past 10 days he 
said 
scowcroft said he feels that gorbachev is dynamic modern 
dedicated to change in the soviet union but what is in doubt 
is what the character of that change and what his motivation for 
change is and there is a major question 
the national security adviser said the evidence so far is 
mixed on gorbachevs true intentions so i think its too early 
to assess how much hes really dedicated to substantive change 
he said

gallardo was able to build up an immense drug operation with 
protection from high mexican officials including a state governor

responsible for the smuggling of 1 to 2 tons of cocaine monthly 
from south america into the united states according to shannons 
book 
the united states has been pressuring mexico to stem the flow of 
drugs across the border mexico has countered that the us demand 
for drugs fuels the mexican narcotics trade 
some us congressmen including sen jesse helms rnc have 
accused mexico of widespread official corruption and maintain that 
certification should be denied

vietnams 10year military occupation 
of cambodia has proved a costly adventure that deprived the 
vietnamese of international support they desperately needed to 
rebuild after years of conflict with the united states 
vietnam announced wednesday it would withdraw its remaining 
5000070000 troops from cambodia by sept 30 
a complete withdrawal without a political settlement would be 
strikingly similar to the soviet pullout from afghanistan or the 
american departure from vietnam 
in each case foreign military intervention fell short of the 
goal of defeating insurgents and guaranteeing a stable friendly 
regime vietnam faces the prospect of seeing the very group it 
sought to defeat the communist khmer rouge reemerge in power 
but the cost of maintaining the occupation has proven too high 
the united states has refused to discuss establishing diplomatic 
relations with hanoi until the cambodian issue is resolved that 
stand has blocked aid vietnams government has begun to seek to 
rebuild its nation 
in june vietnam acknowledged that 25000 of its troops had been 
killed in cambodia and 30000 others had died in border clashes 
before the 1978 invasion 
the occupation also has cost vietnam a chance to expand trade 
ties with noncommunist southeast asian nations 
vietnam launched its invasion on christmas day 1978 three years 
after hanois forces toppled the usbacked south vietnamese 
government in saigon now ho chi minh city 
the vietnamese moved into cambodia to oust the brutal 
administration of the khmer rouge which had killed hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians in a campaign to reshape agriculture and 
society 
by january 1979 vietnamese troops had driven the khmer rouge to 
the thai border and installed heng samrin in power in phnom penh 
but the vietnamese found like the soviets in afghanistan and 
the americans in vietnam that it is easier to invade than depart 
in february 1979 china launched a brief but bloody border war 
to teach vietnam a lesson vietnam inflicted heavy losses on 
chinese forces but the conflict strained vietnamese resources and 
brought china into the cambodian conflict as a source of military 
and diplomatic support for the antivietnamese resistance 
on june 22 1982 the khmer rouge and guerrillas loyal to prince 
norodom sihanouk the former cambodian monarch and to former 
premier son sann announced a resistance coalition that group 
eventually claimed the countrys seat in the united nations 
by then the occupation was weighing heavily on vietnams 
devastated economy finally last june deputy premier vo van kiet 
said the economy faced alarmingly complicated changes 
including famine in the north and runaway inflation 
grain production in 1987 fell from 182 million tons to 176 
million inflation was estimated at nearly 1000 percent and 
unemployment at about 20 percent 
faced with the mounting pressures the vietnamese communist 
politburo met in september to discuss foreign policy in the 
postcambodian period 
sources said the politburo decided to reduce vietnams 
dependence on the soviet union and seek closer ties to the west and 
the prowestern governments of the association of southeast asian 
nations 
the plan however hinged on ending the cambodian adventure 
vietnam withdrew its command staff in june transferring 
responsibility for running the war to the cambodians the soviets 
and americans made similar moves in phasing out their troops in 
afghanistan and south vietnam 
a series of diplomatic moves led to inconclusive peace talks 
between sihanouk and premier hun sen of the vietnamesebacked 
cambodian government 
the future role of the khmer rouge has been the major obstacle 
to a political settlement both vietnam and the united states have 
strongly opposed a khmer rouge return to power 
western diplomats say fighting inside cambodia declined last 
year to its lowest level since the vietnamese invasion but the 
diplomats believe the khmer rouge has been trying to avoid clashes 
and build up arsenals for a showdown after the vietnamese leave 
the khmer rouge denies any intention to seize power 
however the khmer rouge is believed to be the strongest of the 
three groups in the coalition led by sihanouk western estimates 
place the number of khmer rouge guerrillas at 30000 to 40000 
compared with 13000 for the noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation armed forces and 19000 for sihanouks forces 
if the conflict comes to a military head the 30000 to 40000 
government forces may be unable to prevail bereft of vietnamese 
help

the rev tom biatek says he doesnt preach 
fire and brimstone sermons but he does enjoy eating fire 
i dont fit the stereotype of a minister and im very pleased 
about that biatek said i guess im just a nontraditional 
person in a very traditional role 
biatek of the united methodist church of clarence learned how 
to be a fireeater three years ago at the pacific school of 
religion seminary in berkeley calif 
fireeating was part of a class offered that also included 
juggling and storytelling the storytelling he finds useful in 
his sermons particularly to children but i never got the hang 
of juggling 
biatek 26 minister at the clarence church since graduating 
from the theological center seminary in san anselmo calif has 
yet to perform his specialty before his congregation of 193 people 
ive done it for the youth group and the 4h and for the 
christmas carolers last christmas but i havent done it in church 
i guess im afraid that something would go wrong if something did 
go wrong that would kind of upset the worship service a bit he 
said 
but with pentecostal sunday coming up may 14 biatek may change 
his mind 
i might do it then its the most appropriate day it would be 
a good thing because thats when jesus appeared to the disciples 
and put the tongues of fire over each of them he said 
along with fireeating biatek learned how to do a dragons 
breath which is exactly what is sounds like breathing the fire 
in from a torch and spitting the flames back out 
i love cheap magic tricks he said laughing people know 
me and they know ive got a good sense of humor i like to laugh 
and i joke around in the worship service 
this is one way of celebrating life and doing something 
unusual he said no im not a fire and brimstone preacher 
thats too guiltladen i look at worship in church and what i 
preach and the bible as celebrating life 
in college biatek said he took one course per semester that 
i could just have fun in his transcripts include courses in 
astronomy harmonica playing and whitewater rafting 
i want to parachute this year but my wife is against it 
although i think shes giving in biatek said my dream is to 
be on the johnny carson show or to meet david letterman 
biatek admits fireeating is just one of those odd things 
but you know what there were 12 others in my class at that 
seminary school who learned how to eat fire so if theyll just 
come forward now

military jets flew skimmers booms and 
beach landing craft into alaska on sunday and commanders issued a 
pacificwide call for more equipment to fight the nations worst 
oil spill 
kodiak the nations richest fishing port prepared for the 
onslaught of oil by putting out log booms but the coast guard said 
the leading edge of the spill 60 miles away retreated a bit and 
began breaking up into tar balls and sinking 
thats good news said bill lamoreaux the states onscene 
coordinator 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a reef near here march 
24 spilling 101 million gallons of crude into pristine prince 
william sound the oil has spread into the gulf of alaska and 
fouled some of the many islands in the region 
on friday president bush said he would send the military to 
help with the cleanup exxon corp which has been accused of 
moving too slowly to contain the spill will continue to provide 
materials manpower and money 
also sunday 
a 40foot gray whale was found dead in an oilfouled area but 
wildlife experts determined it had died before the spill occurred 
the spill has killed thousands of other animals 
exxon said it was beginning to reimburse fishermen for losses 
from the cancellation of the herring season and had paid 250000 
to cover expenses for fishing boats attacking the spill on their 
own 
coast guard spokesman rick meidt said an air force general made 
a tour of the area and sent a call to bases around the pacific to 
find out what was available and what the estimated time of arrival 
in valdez would be 
the coast guards pacific commander vice adm clyde robbins 
was joining the federal effort other experts dispatched by the 
pentagon surveyed the cleanup and with the help of the military 
cleanup gear poured into valdez 
c5a after c5a is bringing in equipment including 
skimmers more booms and beach landing craft to move people to the 
oily shoreline meidt said 
the navy sent barges outfitted as hotels so that when coastline 
cleanup gets under way workers will be housed near where they are 
working 
the forecast called for continued northeast winds which will 
keep the oil moving toward kodiak 300 miles from the accident 
site kodiak last year produced a fish catch worth 166 million 
but meidt said when the helicopters go up theyre seeing 
streamers a couple of miles long and slicks that are breaking up at 
the edges 
herring boats and coast guard cutters were dispatched to speed 
the breakup of the spill before it reaches kodiak at seward on 
the edge of a national park a skimmer stood ready to protect inner 
bays and fish hatcheries 
three log booms constructed by two kodiak logging companies were 
set in bays spokeswoman linda freed said log booms are highly 
effective as outer barriers and standard plastic booms were being 
used closer to shore she said 
in cordova exxon said it gave the local fishermens union 
250000 for expenses to keep boats in the cleanup and said it was 
writing checks for losses from the canceled herring season about 
12 million worth of herring are taken in a typical season which 
typically lasts less than a day at spawning time 
the state fish and game department said the gray whale was found 
off montague island more than 75 miles from bligh reef where the 
tanker ran aground and was towed to a cove on latouche island 
an autopsy revealed that the whale which was bloated and had 
flaking skin died long before the oil spill ever occurred 
said fish and game spokeswoman sheila nickerson 
officials said 119 dead sea otters have been counted and two 
boats are waiting to unload additional dead animals hundreds of 
dead birds have been counted including some rare yellowbilled 
loons and two eagles 
wildlife experts say the toll is really in the thousands 
however because most dead animals sink in the ocean or remain on 
shore 
some 17000 barrels of the 240000 spilled have been recovered 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said the 
cleanup is removing 1000 to 1500 barrels a day noaa also 
estimated 77000 barrels have evaporated

the plo today rejected israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs proposal to hold elections in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip saying it was a warmed 
over version of the camp david accords 
in its first reaction to shamirs plan the palestine liberation 
organization said any elections in the territories israel occupied 
in the 1967 middle east war should be held after israeli withdrawal 
and under international supervision 
the plo news agency wafa quoted an unidentified plo spokesman as 
saying shamirs plan is nothing but a reactivation of the 
selfautonomy scheme of the camp david accord which the plo and our 
entire palestinian people already have rejected 
shamir unveiled his election ideas in washington last week as a 
way of breaking a deadlock in middle east peace efforts 
his plan calls for having palestinians choose representatives 
for negotiations about an interim settlement in the disputed lands 
the agency called the idea nothing but a maneuver aimed at 
undermining efforts undertaken by several world powers to achieve a 
just settlement in the middle east 
the usbrokered camp david accords between egypt and israel 
called for limited autonomy for palestinians in the west bank and 
gaza strip the 1978 accords led to peace with egypt but were 
rejected by the plo 
the only just solution is an israeli withdrawal from 
palestinian and arab territory the spokesman said the west 
bank and gaza strip should be placed under united nations 
supervision for a transition period during which palestinians 
could exercise their right to selfdetermination including the 
holding of free elections 
the statement reiterated frequent plo calls for an international 
peace conference on the middle east involving all parties 
concerned including the palestinian state proclaimed by the 
plo national council on nov 15 
it is the first time the plo has mentioned the palestinian state 
as the representative of palestinians at the proposed international 
peace conference all previous references mentioned the plo 
in jerusalem an israeli newspaper reported today that shamir 
indicated he might consider allowing palestinians from outside the 
occupied territories to participate in the proposed elections 
interviewed by the maariv daily in chicago shamir was asked 
whether palestinians outside the territories and in annexed east 
jerusalem could vote in his proposed elections he replied the 
question would be a subject for discussion

eastwest trade swelled during the first half of 
1988 ending the stagnation that has prevailed since 1984 a un 
study said today 
the annual report compiled by the 34nation un economic 
commission for europe predicts future growth as a result of 
sovietbloc marketoriented reforms and reduced international 
tensions 
the figures showed the eastern european satellites shifted trade 
away from the soviet union and toward the west last year the 
report said that trend is expected to continue in the next few 
years 
sentiment in most eastern countries appears to have turned 
again in favor of greater integration into the world economy the 
study said 
paced by poland and romania eastern european exports to the 
west rose 7 percent in januaryseptember 1988 the study said 
during that period bulgaria czechoslovakia and east germany 
reversed export declines recorded in 1987 
imports from the west continued a slow recovery with 3 percent 
growth during the same time however hungary and romania in line 
with restrictive economic policies both cut their western exports 
for the second straight year 
higher oil sales mainly reexports of crude from opec 
countries sparked a 13 percent rise in soviet exports to the west 
from januaryseptember 1988 the latest period for which figures 
were available imports jumped 11 percent after a twoyear fall 
with western grain shipments rising steeply 
economic factors cited for the general rise in exports last year 
were continued growth in western countries and tradestimulating 
measures such as currency devaluations by poland and hungary 
in addition the price of soviet oil for eastern europe dropped 
for the first time in a decade making the satellites less 
dependent on exports to the soviet union to pay for crude imports 
and opening the way for more exports to the west the study said 
soviet trade with industrialized western market economies showed 
a 28 billion deficit last year according to western estimates 
quoted in the report eastern europes trade surplus with the west 
meanwhile rose for the third straight year to an estimated 17 
billion 
meanwhile economic growth in the planned economies of the 
soviet bloc rose to 41 percent in 1988 from 26 percent in 1987 
according to official rates 
the report gave no single overall figure reflecting increased 
eastwest trade however it said soviet bloc trade with the west 
and other parts of the world rose 10 percent last year 
the study said relaxed international tensions have fostered more 
eastwest business contacts and economic reforms have granted 
sovietbloc enterprises greater autonomy 
however the report said it is uncertain whether eastern europe 
can sustain the high pace of exports to the west due to lagging 
technology inefficiency and competition from newly 
industrializing countries

missouri gov john ashcroft says an unborn 
baby should not have to die because of the inconvenience or 
desperate circumstances of a pregnant woman so hes asking the 
supreme court to restrict abortions 
as ashcroft made his comments hundreds of thousands of 
prochoice activists marched on the capitol on sunday seeking to 
avert a reversal of the supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion 
the court will hear arguments april 26 on a missouri statute 
that bans abortions and abortion counseling in public facilities 
and requires doctors to try to save fetuses aborted after a certain 
age of gestation 
abortion is a topic that relates to death because we lose 
about a millionsix hundred to millionseven hundred thousand 
unborn babies that are killed in the process ashcroft said on 
cbs face the nation 
he acknowledged that as a result of the law women who had 
abortions might still find themselves with unwanted premature 
babies facing physical problems such as neonatal lung disorders 
asked who pays for the care of the child ashcroft said i 
think that depends 
pressed on whether any state money had been budgeted for the 
care of children who survive abortions he responded the state 
is as a matter of policy eager to save the lives of as many of 
these children as we can and were willing to help not only in 
making sure that the medical needs are met but making sure that 
there are families that take these children 
the republican governor said his state passed the restrictive 
abortion statute because we hope that any time we can save the 
life of a child in missouri that we would seek to save the life of 
that child 
and if the right of an abortion as its currently construed 
is to rid the mother of the whether it be inconvenience or 
desperate circumstances she feels shes in because shes pregnant 
if that doesnt mean the baby has to die we dont see any reason 
for that baby to die 
ashcroft defended the provision of the missouri statute banning 
abortion in public facilities and denied that it discriminated 
against poor women 
many of the poorer people in our state are treated in private 
hospitals he said as a matter of fact the trend is away from 
public hospitals so difficult to administer and frequently work 
on patients that would ordinarily be in a public hospital are 
referred on a contract basis to private hospitals now

former supreme court nominee robert bork 
says the earl warren court is responsible for the continuing 
political demonstrations that surround the high courts decisions 
at a conference commemorating the 20year anniversary of 
warrens retirement as chief justice bork a former federal 
appeals court judge whose nomination to the supreme court was 
rejected in 1987 said the activism of the warren court 
damaged perceptions of the legal system 
people have vigils around the court they march up and down 
constitution avenue and what that means is that they perceive the 
court as essentially a political institution i think thats 
dangerous 
he spoke sunday as hundreds of thousands of abortionrights 
advocates marched in the nations capital calling for continuation 
of legal abortion which the court is to reexamine april 26 
bork did not discuss the abortion issue but referred to the 
warren courts declaration of a constitutional right of privacy 
which because the basis of the warren burger courts 1973 ruling 
legalizing abortions as one of the courts excesses 
borks rejection of a constitutional right of privacy was a 
central issue in the senates rejection of his nomination to the 
high court by president reagan bork has since resigned as an 
appeals judge and is a speaker on conservative issues and a scholar 
at the american enterprise institute 
he took part in a panel discussion part of a weekend of events 
commemorating warren an eisenhower appointee who served on the 
supreme court from 1953 to 1969 and died in 1974 
at a dinner saturday night justice william brennan said warren 
with whom he served 13 years will be remembered for his concern 
with fairness for the disadvantaged the downtrodden the poor the 
friendless and for his leadership at a time of the greatest 
diversity of deeply troublesome questions in our courts history 
but bork speaking to reporters after his panel appearance said 
the nation would be better off if the warren court had never 
existed 
if i had a court of byron whites judges in that range i 
think the country would be better off because there wouldnt have 
been so many excesses he said white appointed by president 
john f kennedy served in the later years of the warren court but 
dissented from some of its liberal rulings

abortion rights activists lobbied on capitol 
hill today as their leaders predicted that the massive turnout for 
their march will leave a strong impression on the supreme court 
nobody in public office isnt affected by a huge outpouring 
said molly yard president of the national organization for women 
hundreds of activists who took part in sundays march got some 
quick lessons in congressional lobbying and then made their way to 
the offices of their local representative or senator to press their 
case 
wearing buttons with the words be a voice for choice or 
catholics for a free choice activists thanked the 140 
lawmakers who had signed a friendofthecourt brief in the 
missouri case now pending before the supreme court and urged others 
to support abortionrights legislation 
the notion is for as many people as possible to see senators 
or congressmen bill hamilton a washington dc lobbyist for 
planned parenthood told activists from new york and rhode island 
although the matter is up to the court yard defended the 
congressional lobbying effort noting that members of congress and 
the bush administration speak to the nine justices on the court 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
everyone has the right to march and present their views it 
appears that it was a very successful march over the weekend in 
terms of the number of people they wanted to get here they 
presented their views very effectively and thats good 
vice president dan quayle however said the march was nothing 
unusual in this town 
i dont believe the supreme court should be nor do we expect 
it to be swayed by a demonstration that is not the way the system 
is supposed to work they are there to render a legal opinion 
quayle said 
the march for womens equality womens lives attracted 
hundreds of thousands of men and women democrats and republicans 
hollywood stars and everyday people who converged on the capitol 
for speeches songs and declarations that women will never again 
return to the days of illegal abortions in back alleys 
while law enforcement authorities estimated the rally crowd at 
300000 eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist 
majority said the turnout was more than 600000 
either way the turnout was higher than the 90000 people who 
gathered for a march 1986 abortion rights rally in washington and 
the numbers that the rallys organizers had predicted 
its a turning point its a totally new ball game smeal 
said its given us the confidence that we are the majority 
claiming newfound political clout abortion rights activists are 
meeting today with members of congress to lobby aggressively for 
support of the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
their main focus however is the supreme court which will hear 
arguments april 26 in a missouri case that prochoice and 
antiabortion forces agree could significantly alter the ruling 
that gave women the right to an abortion 
i dont think they can miss this huge outpouring yard said 
of the court 
college students by the busloads mothers with babies in tow 
members of congress and even activists from as far away as 
australia marched down constitution avenue chanting choice 
choice choice or not the church not the state women must 
decide our fate 
they carried purple white and yellow banners colors of the 
womens suffrage movement that said members of congress for 
choice brooklyn womens political caucus and the names of 
various other groups in attendance 
emerging from anonymity was norma mccorvey better known as the 
jane roe of the roe vs wade decision the texas woman who only 
recently has given speeches to small audiences and was visibly 
shaken by reporters questions said she attended the rally because 
our laws in jeopardy 
some of the marchers wore coat hangers on their clothing or 
their heads a reference to the often deadly selfabortion 
technique used before the procedure was legalized 
we said people would turn out if they thought anything could 
happen to roe vs wade and they did yard said 
at the start of the march the abortion rights activists 
exchanged taunts with about 200 to 300 antiabortion demonstrators 
along the march route the group was held back by police on 
horseback 
the antiabortion activists set up a symbolic cemetery of the 
innocents on the washington mall containing 4400 white wooden 
crosses and stars of david according to organizers the number 
represents the unborn children killed daily since the supreme court 
legalized abortion 
participants in the abortion rights rally said they were there 
because they fear a reversal of roe vs wade 
were scared said ellen davidson a yale university junior 
from hewlett ny because were coming to the realization that 
the thing weve taken for granted can be taken away 
gloria steinem a pioneer in the womens rights movement 
likened the fundamental question of reproductive freedom to 
freedom of speech 
if we go back before where we were in 1973 its exactly like 
saying freedom of speech is up to state legislatures steinem 
said

has forced a colonel to resign after investigations of attacks on 
palestinians by soldiers under his command a military source said

than a decade against an officer of such a high rank serving in the 
occupied territories

have in the past year used troops to quell ethnic disturbances in 
november troops and tanks were sent to armenia and azerbaijan

visitor at the central hospital who refused to give his name 
there is no transport all stores are closed except food stores 
factories are closed

a short circuit apparently started a fire on a 
soviet nuclear submarine causing several explosions that may have 
cracked the hull and sunk the ship the government newspaper 
izvestia said today 
tass reported two torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads were 
aboard the nuclearpowered submarine that sank in the norweigan sea 
friday and killed 42 of the 69 sailors aboard the official news 
agency said there was no threat of radiation contamination 
izvestias report today quoting an investigation under way at 
northern fleet headquarters in the arctic port of murmansk said 
according to preliminary information the fire started because of 
a short circuit 
the newspaper quoted defense minister dmitri t yazov as saying 
that after fighting the fire for two or three hours the crew heard 
several explosions 
it is possible that the hull was cracked in a series of 
places izvestia said 
the explosions may have occurred in seven pieces of special 
equipment izvestia said it did not further identify them 
the ships log was saved and investigators are going over it to 
determine what happened the newspaper said crews had determined 
the exact location of the submarine it said 
the newspaper report shed some light on the fate of the crew 
soviet media said previously that 42 of the submarines 69 crew 
including the captain died a soviet ship rescued the others and 
took them to a hospital in murmansk 
izvestia said four sailors went down with the submarine and 
that two of those who were pulled from the icy water died later 
rescue teams found only 19 bodies it said 
a spokesman for the foreign ministry reiterated previous soviet 
reports that there was no danger of a radiation leak the spokesman 
added no decision had been made yet whether it was possible to 
raise the submarine which sank more than 4500 feet in waters 
about 310 miles west of tromsoe on norways west coast 
the question of lifting the submarine up has not been decided 
yet spokesman gennady i gerasimov told reporters 
the official news agency tass said today that investigators had 
found no fault with the effort to extinguish the fire according 
to the opinion of the government commission created to investigate 
this tragic event the crew of the submarine acted bravely and 
intelligently tass said 
us officials have said the vessel one of the soviets most 
advanced was capable of carrying more than a dozen longrange 
missiles in addition to the torpedoes 
the soviets officially informed norway of the accident nearly 
nine hours after the vessel sank the norwegian news agency ntb 
claimed norwegian rescue helicopters could have reached the ship 
several hours before soviet fishing vessels if the soviets had 
asked for help promptly 
in oslo norway prepared a list of 10 questions for the soviet 
union about the construction and safeguards of the reactors aboard 
the submarine 
we are not trying to pry into their military secrets but we 
are concerned about other circumstances of safety said norwegian 
foreign ministry spokeswoman sigrid romundset 
tass said the ship was armed with two nucleartipped torpedoes 
but they were designed against radiation leaks even under the 
intense pressure of deep water 
fridays sinking came five months after a reported nearmeltdown 
in a nuclear reactor aboard a soviet icebreaker in murmansk 
according to the newspaper vodny transport a worker drained 
cooling water from an operating reactor rather than one that was 
shut down for repairs 
had the water drained 30 minutes longer a meltdown releasing 
radiation into the air over the city of 440000 would have 
occurred the newspaper said in october 1986 three sailors died 
in a fire and explosion aboard a soviet nuclearpowered submarine 
in the atlantic ocean that vessel was armed with ballistic 
missiles

independent historian roy medvedev won a runoff 
election for a new soviet congress and the academy of sciences 
restored andrei d sakharov to the ballot for separate elections to 
the chamber official reports said today 
the balloting around the nation sunday was the second stage of 
the soviet unions first multicandidate national elections in 71 
years 
in the first round march 26 voters rejected at least 45 
government and communist party leaders in their bids for seats in 
the new congress of peoples deputies 
the official news agency tass said sakharov the human rights 
activist who won the 1975 nobel peace prize was among those 
nominated during a meeting of the academy of sciences 
tass said 168 members were proposed as candidates for 12 seats 
still available from the academy and that todays session had 
whittled that number down to 28 including sakharov and space 
scientist roald sagdeev 
the nominees will be presented to academy membership for 
balloting on april 1921 to choose the 12 deputies tass said 
of 2250 seats in the congress 750 were assigned to the 
communist party and its affiliates as well as social and 
professional organizations like the academy of sciences 
sakharov was previously proposed as a candidate but an 
electoral commission cut him and other wellknown reformers from 
the final list in favor of oldguard academy managers sakharov 
supporters successfully blocked about twothirds of that slate and 
forced a second election 
historian medvedev unlike sakharov ran in one of the 1500 
geographical electoral districts 
medvedev whose studies of stalinism were unpublishable in the 
soviet union until recently won 523 percent of the vote sunday in 
his race in moscows voroshilov district against ksenya razumova 
head of an atomic research laboratory district election officials 
said 
the official tass news agency said writer yuri chernichenko also 
won election in his race against philosophy professor gennady k 
ashin in another moscow district it did not give figures 
chernichenko was a supporter of former moscow communist party 
boss boris n yeltsins successful maverick candidacy and ran on a 
platform urging wideranging agricultural reform at an election 
rally a week before the election he said the soviet union must 
turn from an importer to an exporter of grain 
tass said 671 percent of the voters took part in balloting in 
moscow far below the level of about 90 percent who participated 
march 26 in the first contested national elections in the soviet 
union in 71 years 
among the other winners sunday were yuri skokov director of the 
kvant scientific conglomerate who defeated pyotr surov in a third 
moscow district 
the elections in eight moscow districts were among 64 runoff 
elections held sunday throughout the country where more than two 
candidates had run march 26 and no one received a majority 
tass said new elections would be held in 199 of the districts on 
may 14 in 195 of them only one or two candidates ran but no one 
received a majority 
among those who lost in uncontested races in the initial 
balloting were candidate politburo member yuri solovyev in 
leningrad and a host of top party officials in moscow leningrad 
kiev and other big cities more than half the voters in those races 
voted no

in a month or less farmers traders and 
federal planners will know a lot more about 1989 wheat prospects 
than they do now says carl schwensen executive vice president of 
the national association of wheat growers 
the fate of the kansas crop will be clearer along with a few 
other trouble spots where dry weather has hurt winter wheat 
prospects since planting time last fall 
also he says farmers who plant spring wheat in the northern 
plains will be busy the next few weeks with this years crop 
producers in the dakotas for example were hit hard by the 1988 
drought and are hoping to bounce back this year 
but schwensen admitted in a telephone interview last week that 
these are sensitive times for wheat farmers by and large 
winter wheat producers last year escaped the drought ravages that 
crippled spring wheat feed grains and soybeans 
winter wheat since it was planted last fall is the first of 
the major field crops to be harvested as such it always draws the 
most attention at this time of year 
the agriculture department will issue its first official 
estimate of 1989 winter wheat output on may 11 spring wheat along 
with corn soybeans cotton and others planted this spring wont 
be estimated officially by usda until aug 10 
however usda and private forecasters always issue 
projections of crop yields based on historical trends 
assumptions of normal weather patterns and prevailing conditions 
the usda projections some of them not yet endorsed as official 
so far have shown the total us wheat crop in 1989 may range from 
around 23 billion bushels to 245 billion 
in either case that would be up sharply from last years 
droughtsmitten 181 billion bushel but still short of expected 
use in the wheat marketing year that will begin on june 1 the 
increase would be due to a boost in plantings and improved yields 
per acre 
meanwhile because of reduced supplies farmers have seen 
substantial increases in wheat market prices those appear assured 
at least until more is known about this years harvest 
but federal law decrees that usda look ahead to next year and 
come up with a program that will best suit the interests of 
farmers consumers and taxpayers in general 
on april 4 the department asked for public comments on how to 
finetune the wheat program for 1990 production perhaps the 
biggest decision will be on the size of the acreage reduction 
program or arp which must be announced by june 1 
the arp involves the amount of crop base acreage wheat farmers 
are required to idle in order to be eligible for federal price 
supports and related benefits such as deficiency payments 
direct subsidies paid when market prices are low in relation to a 
target price 
when wheat stockpiles were large more than 19 billion bushels 
carried over into the new crop year on june 1 1986 for example 
the acreage setaside requirement was set at 25 percent or more 
the wheat carryover dropped however and by june 1 1988 was 
down to 126 billion bushels the 1987 and 1988 arp requirement was 
275 percent but last may 25 the usda announced the 1989 setaside 
at 10 percent as the effects of the drought became better known 
the arp for 1989 was reviewed again but was kept at 10 percent 
federal law says the arp cannot be set at more than 20 percent 
if wheat inventories are less than 1 billion bushels at the 
beginning of the new marketing year those are expected to be about 
534 million bushels on june 1 and about the same a year from now 
schwensen said his association in january endorsed continuing 
the arp for 1990 at 10 percent the bush administrations budget 
proposal sent to congress asked for a 5 percent arp for next years 
wheat crop and some people have urged taking off all restrictions 
a zero arp in order to replenish us granaries 
i dont think our members would want to see a zero arp 
schwensen said 
that could trigger larger acreage greater production weaker 
wheat market prices and greater federal costs he said 
we need to watch closely what unfolds in the next 10 days to 
two weeks out in the plains areas schwensen said that could 
have an effect not only on the 1990 wheat acreage but on other 
program decisions including the export enhancement program eep 
and other things 
the eep provides federal export subsidies for certain 
commodities to selected foreign markets and has been a major factor 
in keeping us wheat exports flowing including large shipments to 
china and the soviet union 
according to usda projections used by planners looking at 
possibilities for 1990 the continuation of this years 10 percent 
arp could mean a wheat harvest next year of about 263 billion 
bushels which could mean a modest rise in carryover stocks by june 
1 1991 to 614 million bushels farm prices of wheat might average 
345 per bushel down from 365 expected this season 
the 5 percent arp could mean a harvest of 263 billion bushels 
a 1991 carryover of 629 million bushels and a farm price average of 
340 per bushel 
at zero arp the 1990 wheat harvest might be 275 billion 
bushels a 1991 carryover of 689 million bushels and a price 
average of 325 per bushel

a un official said monday 
edouard saouma director general of the food and agriculture 
organization told the opening session of the romebased agencys 
committee on fisheries that world fish demand could exceed 100 
million tons by the end of the century 
fisheries have increased production steadily from 20 million 
tons a year after world war ii to more than 90 million tons in 
1987 he said 
almost all major stocks of bottomdwelling fish and crustaceans 
such as lobsters and crabs have been heavily exploited and some 
are nearing depletion he said 
aquaculture which involves raising and harvesting marine plants 
and animals is expected to increase production to about 22 million 
tons in the next decade more than double the 1985 level the fao

rough weather continued to break up the 
leading edge of the giant gloppy exxon valdez oil spill the coast 
guard said today but the nations richest fishing port prepared 
for the worst by stringing logs across bays 
on sunday us military jets flew skimmers booms and beach 
landing craft into alaska and commanders issued a pacificwide 
call for more equipment to fight the nations worst oil spill 
in kodiak 300 miles southwest of the spill site fishermen 
covered logs with fish net and spread them across vital fishing 
areas sunday but officials reported today that the slick seems to 
have stalled on its on a southwesterly course for the island with 
high winds making the water so choppy that the blob of oil doesnt 
move 
its not pushing it oil to the kenai peninsula and thats 
good said coast guard spokesman rick meidt referring to the 
land mass to the west of the spill and northeast of kodiak the 
weather is breaking up the slick and thats good in the past 
three days meidt said the slick apparently hasnt moved any 
further 
small craft advisories and a gale warning were posted at kodiak 
which saw rain seas to 15 feet and winds from the northeast to 35 
knots early today the national weather service said winds 
decreased toward valdez which reported a northeast wind at 10 
knots 
oil was still at least 60 miles from kodiak where officials 
even used television to display boommaking techniques 
herring boats and coast guard cutters were dispatched to speed 
the breakup of the spill whose 166 million catch last year was 
the nations most lucrative at seward on the edge of a 
stillthreatened national park a skimmer stood ready to protect 
inner bays and fish hatcheries 
in other developments 
us gasoline prices jumped more than a dime a gallon in the 
wake of the tanker spill according to the lundberg survey prices 
however were showing signs of easing said analyst trilby lundberg 
exxon said it was beginning to reimburse cordova fishermen for 
losses from the cancellation of the 12 million herring season and 
had paid 250000 to cover expenses for fishing boats attacking the 
spill on their own 
the state said the tanker anchored in a remote cove for 
repairs continues to leak oil which escapes containment booms 
because currents keep shifting the barrier around snagging it on 
the tankers bow today the coast guard said salvage workers have 
reinforced punctured areas of the tanker itself to prevent further 
fractures 
the tanker could be seen sitting dead calm with a halfdozen 
smaller boats around it steam drifted from its stack a radar arm 
rotating and a helicopter on its deck long streamers of congealed 
oil the color of chocolate milk drifted off for miles 
cleanup crews planned to resume shoreline work on an 
experimental basis testing different pressurized washing systems 
plans to allow a small trawler to harvest shrimp in prince 
william sound were canceled 
a 40foot gray whale was found dead in an oil area sunday but 
an autopsy revealed that it died long before the oil spill 
occurred said alaska department of fish and game spokeswoman 
sheila nickerson 
biologists planned to investigate a report of a dead seal south 
of latouche island to determine what may have killed it said karen 
gleason a spokeswoman for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
wildlife experts say spring is a time when many animals are 
found dead in prince william sound 
on friday president bush said he would send troops to help the 
cleanup and put the federal government virtually in control of the 
effort exxon will continue to pay for materials and manpower 
air force lt gen thomas mcinerney chief of the alaskan air 
command asked bases around the pacific to find out what was 
available and what the eta estimated time of arrival would be for 
valdez meidt said today the coast guard said it was brining in 
six more cutters from the west coast 
experts dispatched by the pentagon began assessing the cleanup 
and more were expected today with the help of the military 
cleanup gear was pouring into valdez 
c5a after c5a is bringing in equipment including 10 navy 
skimmers 200000 feet of 7footdeep containment boom and even 
beach landing craft to move people to the oily shoreline meidt 
said the c5a is the nations largest cargo plane 
the navy also was sending barges outfitted as hotels so that 
when coastline cleanup gets under way workers will be housed 
nearby 
officials said 119 dead sea otters have been counted and two 
boats are waiting to unload additional dead animals hundreds of 
dead birds have been counted including some rare yellowbilled 
loons and two eagles 
wildlife experts say the toll is really in the thousands because 
most dead animals sink in water or remain on shore 
about 18000 barrels of the 240000 spilled have been recovered 
as of today officials said the cleanup is removing 1000 to 1500 
barrels a day in addition some of the oil has evaporated in the 
last 2 weeks

british and australian soldiers flew to 
northern namibia today and immediately deployed to monitor the 
withdrawal of back nationalist guerrillas after fighting 
jeopardized a un independence plan 
the 23 british and 64 australians soldiers part of the un 
monitoring force flew from the capital of windhoek to grootfontein 
town then drove northward to assembly points and border posts 
starting tuesday guerrillas of the southwest africa peoples 
organization are to report to the posts and assembly points for the 
peacekeepers to escort them back bases in angola 
about 1900 guerrillas nearly derailed a unsponsored plan to 
bring independence to this former german colony when they crossed 
the border from angola and heavy fighting broke out with south 
africanled security forces april 1 
a partially deployed un monitoring force was criticized for 
not being able to check the incursions 
on sunday after south africa reported at least 263 of his 
guerrillas were killed swapo president sam nujoma ordered the 
insurgents to leave namibia south african cuban and angolan 
officials agreed at a weekend meeting to give the guerrillas until 
saturday to leave with a guarantee of safe passage us and soviet 
officials observed the meeting at a namibian game lodge 
police reported calm in the northern bush for the second day 
monday and said they are waiting to see whether the guerrillas 
obey orders to leave the lull follows the fiercest fighting in the 
23year war for this mineralrich territory which south africa has 
ruled since world war i 
martti ahtisaari of finland the special un envoy in namibia 
told a news conference no official ceasefire is in effect but 
the south africans have undertaken to restrain their forces 
south african foreign minister pik botha said of the guerrillas 
sunday night if they do not attack they will not be attacked 
at least 263 guerrillas and 28 security force members have been 
killed in the fighting acccording to south african officials 
swapo says its losses were much lower and charges nearly onefifth 
of those killed were civilians 
ahtisaari said the united nations will begin flying its flag at 
noon tuesday at two churches south of the angolan border and at 
seven along the border the assembly points will be expanded to 18 
the information also will be broadcast on the radio he said 
through an aide 
the agreement was a major concession by south africa ahtisaari 
said 
botha said the guerrillas who assemble at churches inside 
namibia will have to give their weapons to un forces who will 
then fly them to bases in angola 
guerrillas who travel to churches along the namibianangolan 
border will be allowed to keep their arms and the angolan 
government will take responsibility for returning them to their 
bases botha said 
south africa contends swapo has sent more than 1900 guerrillas 
into northern namibia from angola since april 1 in violation of the 
unsponsored accord which requires them to remain at bases at 
least 100 miles inside angola until midmay 
swapo had maintained that the guerrillas were inside namibia 
prior to april and should be allowed to set up bases in the 
territory 
but nujoma said he decided to pull out his fighters because he 
did not want to give south africa an excuse to cancel namibias 
independence plans 
some un officials have suggested swapo field commanders 
mistakenly thought their units could return to namibia beginning 
april 1 several captured guerrillas have said they returned to 
namibia in search of un personnel and expected no confrontations 
with security forces 
the united nations has authorized a peacekeeping force of 4650 
soldiers for namibia but only about 1000 have arrived 
swapo is favored to win the most votes in preindependence 
elections scheduled for november under the unsponsored accord 
the way for namibian independence was cleared in december when 
south africa angola and cuba signed a regional peace plan 
cuba agreed to withdraw 50000 cuban troops who have helped 
marxistruled angola battle usbacked rebels in exchange south 
africa agreed to stop supporting the angolan rebels and allow 
namibia to become independent

month in a london fringe theater to coincide with the 100th

the producers about a madcap impresario putting on a musical 
called springtime for hitler 
according to the london alternative magazine playwright david 
parker has written a devastating parallel between britain in the 
1980s and hitlers germany

a public interest group said monday that the 
national security agency the nations biggest intelligence agency 
could exert excessive control over a program to strengthen the 
security of computer systems throughout the federal government 
the group computer professionals for social responsibility 
urged key members of congress to focus particularly close 
scrutiny on the nsas role in helping to implement legislation 
aimed at safeguarding sensitive but unclassified information in 
federal computers 
there is a constant risk that federal agencies under the 
guise of enhancing computer security may find their programs to 
the extent that they rely upon computer systems increasingly 
under the supervision of the largest and most secretive 
intelligence organization in the country it said 
in a letter sent to capitol hill the group said that the 
clandestine nature of the nsa its classified budget the 
difficulty in overseeing its activities and its aggressive use of 
advanced technologies for eavesdropping and encryption and 
decryption of communications raise serious concerns about its 
role in implementing the computer security act 
computer professionals for social responsibility based in palo 
alto calif describes itself as an organization of computer 
scientists and other professionals concerned about the impact of 
computer technology on society 
the letter signed by marc rotenberg head of the groups 
washington office was sent to reps dan glickman dkan doug 
walgren dpa and tim valentine dnc 
glickman a member of the house intelligence committee was one 
of the authors of the computer security act walgren and valentine 
are chairmen of house science subcommittees overseeing 
computerrelated issues 
commenting on the letter glickman said 
i think there is some legitimate concern about the role of nsa 
in computer security issues we need to make certain that they 
dont assert power over civilian computer records in this 
country 
cynthia beck a spokeswoman at the nsas public affairs office 
declined to comment on the letter 
the nsa headquartered at fort meade md about halfway between 
washington and baltimore has a work force topping 60000 employees 
more than all other us spy agencies combined and a budget 
said to be upwards of 10 billion a year 
its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the 
world encrypting us communications and cracking foreign codes 
as well as protecting the security of us military computers and 
communications systems 
last month the nsa reached an agreement with the national 
institute of standards and technology a research arm of the 
commerce department based in suburban gaithersburg md 
the memorandum of understanding was aimed at facilitating a 
program under which the two agencies have started jointly reviewing 
thousands of computer security plans submitted by offices 
throughout the government 
in its letter the computer professionals group noted that 
institute lacks the resources to fully implement the computer 
security legislation and thus must rely on the nsa for assistance 
this may be a marriage of convenience but it is not a 
marriage between equals it said nsas resources for this 
particular project are by best estimates at least 10 times 
greater in manpower and budget than those of the institute 
the letter contended that congress must monitor the actions of 
the nsa particularly closely under the computer security act the 
nsa will have access to information about computer systems 
throughout the entire federal government 
this is an extraordinary amount of information and literally 
provides a blueprint for the management of all federal computer 
systems it said

kill you ill kill you repeatedly stabbed a psychiatric social 
worker at a mental health center police and the victim said 
sundays attack on shirley ann sauerwein 44 was the second 
knifing in seven weeks at a mental health facility in santa monica 
the first one was fatal 
ms sauerwein was in good condition today at santa monica 
hospital medical center where she was expected to remain for 
several days for treatment of five wounds in the chest and arms 
said a nursing supervisor 
a patient larry anthony taylor 27 was arrested and held for 
investigation of attempted murder in the jail ward at countyusc 
medical center said sgt frank fabrega 
ms sauerwein said she feels no animosity toward taylor who she 
said had an irrational fear of an upcoming court hearing on a minor 
criminal matter 
larry is a young man who is immature and in certain instances 
cannot practice the best judgment she said from her hospital bed 
ms sauerwein said she works for the los angeles county 
department of childrens services and parttime at the santa monica

in her chest and arms 
he kept saying ill kill you ill kill you then i said 
larry if you do that they will send you to jail she said 
she fended off a few more blows and finally he fled she said 
taylor was captured outside the building 
she said the attack will not make her afraid of returning to her 
job because it is something you are trained to anticipate 
in an unrelated attack sunday evening a mental patient 
handcuffed to a gurney at st johns hospital grabbed the gun of a 
police officer guarding him and fired two shots missing the

the environmental protection agency today 
issued guidelines to school officials on how to test for lead in 
water fountains saying more than a million fountains still being 
used in schools have lead components 
a law enacted last year required the epa to issued the 
guidelines as well as develop a list of what brand and models of 
school water coolers have lead components the law directed a 
timetable for eliminating those coolers or correcting the problem 
lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low 
levels of exposure it can cause damage to the brain and nervous 
system and lead to learning disabilities hearing impairment and 
interference in the formation of red blood cells according to the 
epa 
mike cook director of the epa office that deals with drinking 
water contamination said lead in school drinking fountains is only 
one of many sources from which children may be exposed to lead 
a greater source of lead in drinking water often is the pipe 
systems that carry the water 
nevertheless the epa said three manufacturers of drinking 
fountain coolers in schools have estimated that more than 1 million 
coolers in use contain some lead components two other 
manufacturers did not respond and another said it made no coolers 
with lead components said cook 
the epa issued more than 100 model numbers of fountain coolers 
that have been found to contain lead components the agency also 
made public six models of coolers still in use that have tanks that 
are lined with lead cook said he had no estimate how many coolers 
were manufactured with leadlined tanks 
young children are of particular risk from lead even with only 
shortterm exposure according to the epa lead in drinking water 
typically accounts for about 20 percent of the total lead exposure 
in young children 
cook said the epa considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion 
in water to pose health risks while the agency gave no levels for 
all the coolers cited in todays announcement it said that in some 
coolers that had leadlined tanks the levels were more than several 
hundred parts per billion 
weve found very high levels of lead in these leadlined 
tanks cook told reporters 
he said the coolers found to have lead components are only a 
small fraction of the total number of coolers used by schools 
although the epa has no solid figures on how many coolers are 
actually in use nationwide

three teams of american experts will travel to 
hanoi later this week for 2 weeks of investigative work searching 
for us servicemen missing from the vietnam war the pentagon said 
monday 
in addition the vietnamese government has informed the united 
states it intends to repatriate 21 remains which may be those of 
americans on april 27 the pentagon said in a statement 
the investigative teams will arrive in hanoi on wednesday for 
what will be the fifth such joint mission working with vietnamese 
officials in the field 
the three teams two comprised of investigators and one 
consisting of forensic scientists have been told they can remain 
in the country until april 30 making this the longest such mission 
ever the pentagon added 
previous usvietnamese field missions were limited to 10 days 
each 
the teams concentrate their efforts primarily on investigating 
geographic areas near the last known position of socalled 
discrepancy cases a discrepancy case is one in which the us 
government has reason to believe an american serviceman survived an 
airplane crash or hostile fire 
the joint teams also attempt to investigate livesighting 
reports and other claims about the fate of missing servicemen 
the pentagon said the three teams participating in this months 
work would consist of a total of 10 individuals a separate team of 
americans will fly to hanoi on april 27 to take possession of the 
remains that vietnam has said it will turn over then 
according to the pentagon there are still 2370 american 
servicemen missing from the vietnam war including 1736 in either 
north or south vietnam in addition 545 are listed as missing in 
laos 83 in cambodia and six in china 
the pentagon said most of the investigative work planned this 
month would be concentrated in what used to be south vietnam in 
and around the area of danang

two agriculture department scientists said 
today that a natural yeast found in the stomach of a beetle can 
neutralize deadly farm chemicals and natural toxins that sometimes 
are found in the nations food supply 
entomologists patrick f dowd and samuel k shen of the 
departments agricultural research service said that if the 
preliminary tests are borne out in further experiments the yeast 
could be used to remove potentially harmful toxins from livestock 
feed and to clean up the environment 
although were not yet sure of its full range of detoxifying 
ability the implication we see here is for the environmental 
cleanup situations like toxic waste dumps shen said 
if the yeast can be developed properly it could be 
massproduced to detoxify a wide variety of plant and chemical 
toxins in the environment he said in a report issued here by the 
usda agency 
shen spoke monday at a meeting of the american chemical society 
in dallas texas he and dowd along with geneticist nancy j 
alexander are working on the project at the agencys northern 
regional research center in peoria ill 
the yeast is found naturally in the stomach of the cigarette 
beetle a pest of stored tobacco spices and other products the 
yeast provides the insect with vitamins and nutrients and it 
neutralizes certain toxins this enables the insect to feed on a 
wider range of plant materials 
in laboratory tests the researchers found that the yeasts 
enzymes acted on a variety of compounds including the insecticides 
parathion and carbaryl phytic acid which can make some seed meals 
unfit as livestock feed and a precursor of aflatoxin a fungal 
toxin suspected of being carcinogenic 
the scientists plan to text the yeast against aflatoxin itself 
some of last years droughtdamaged corn crop has had high levels 
of aflatoxin a naturally occuring carcinogen 
a number of microorganisms are already used to a limited extent 
to clean water systems and soil shen said but unlike those the 
yeast could be used for multiple cleanup tasks 
dowd shens colleague said that one of the limitations of the 
yeast is that it is a slowgrowing microorganism 
to successfully produce this thing we need to find a 
fastergrowing strain or a way to genetically transfer its 
detoxifying ability to a fastergrowing yeast dowd said

social security commissioner dorcas r hardy 
on monday defended the agencys plan to use a nationwide 800 
telephone number to do most of its business with the public and 
said people will be able to get through with one call 95 percent of 
the time by next fall 
she testified before the senate special committee on aging 
whose members received complaints from constituents during january 
and february when the new system was flooded with calls 
the general accounting office an arm of congress said the 
busy rate jumped to 43 percent in january and was 35 percent in 
february due largely to material mailed to 36 million beneficaries 
promoting use of the 800 number 
however the gao said that high busy rate compared with a 17 
percent busy average over the preceeding three months and a 9 
percent rate lowest ever in march 
hardy told the panel the agency is working on the assumption 
that there is a 15 percent chance a caller will get a busy signal 
on the first call now and that the goal is to reduce that to 5 
percent by oct 1 when the system is fully installed 
it covers about 60 percent of the nation now and when fully 
installed will feature the ability for calls to be channeled from 
more busy phone centers to less busy phone centers 
the number is the main current listing for social security in 
areas of the nation where it is in service 
hardy told the committee that with 120 million american adults 
directly affected by social security there will always be isolated 
examples of callers encountering troubles 
she noted that the agency has handled 22 million calls since it 
started putting the 800 number system in place six months ago in 
what hardy said was the publics increasing preference to do 
business by telephone when possible 
live operators are available from 7 am to 7 pm monday 
through friday to answer questions and provide basic services such 
as mailing forms recorded messages are available nights and 
weekends to provide basic information process some actions and 
take messages for callback the next business day 
hardy said operators schedule appointments at the nearest social 
security office for callers who need facetoface service 
the american people want to deal with us by telephone said 
hardy this program was not done to cut costs but to provide 
better service 
the nationwide telephone system is part of the socalled project 
2000 longrange social security management strategy developed by 
hardy and praised recently by the house ways and means subcommittee 
that has primary oversight responsibility over the social security 
administration 
the house and senate aging committees have no direct 
jurisdiction over social security but typically serve as a conduit 
for beneficaries upset with what they believe to be inadequate 
service from the program

oliver north testified at his trial today that 
former president reagan and thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
concealed us involvement in a possibly illegal 1985 arms shipment 
to iran 
the former white house aide said that in a meeting on nov 12 
1986 clearly the president had made a decision not to 
disclose the november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles from israel 
to iran 
at a news conference on nov 19 a week after that meeting 
reagan said there were no other shipments which the united states 
condoned besides the ones in 1986 
concluding three days of questioning by his own lawyers north 
also testified today that he assumed reagan had known of the 
diversion of iran arms sale funds to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
north said he had the approval of his boss thennational 
secutiry adviser john poindexter for the diversion and i 
believed that i had it from the president of the united states 
when the attorney general announced on nov 25 1986 that a 
criminal investigation would be undertaken i was shocked it was 
probably one of the most shocking things i had ever heard north 
testified 
he recalled that in meeting with meese two days earlier he 
supplied details about the november 1985 shipment which was 
assisted by the cia reagan in december 1985 signed a presidential 
finding approving the us role after the fact north said he told 
meese that we ought to stand up and acknowledge this shipment 
two days after north met with meese the attorney general told a 
nationally televised news conference that the israelis had made the 
1985 shipment without us involvement 
meese gave a whole series of answers that were 
inconsistent with what i had told him two days previously said 
north 
it made me wonder whether i had talked to the attorney 
general two days earlier said north 
at his nov 25 1986 news conference meese said that all of 
these transactions that i am referring to took place between 
january of 1986 and the present time 
meese said further that reagan later learned in february of 
1986 details about another shipment that had taken place in 
november of 85 
north said iran was very outraged about the november 1985 
shipment out of concern for the safety of us hostages held in 
lebanon the reagan administration was anxious not to be associated 
with the hawks he said 
the iranians were dissatisfied with the hawk missiles because 
they werent designed to shoot down planes flying at high 
altitudes he said 
in later testimony today north said he kept 15000 in cash 
inside a metal box bolted down in a closet at his house and used 
some of the money to buy a utility vehicle 
north brought up the metal box in his testimony when prosecutor 
john keker intimated that he might have gotten the money for the 
vehicle from a fund used to pay the expenses of contra leaders 
north said he established the family cash fund in 1967 with an 
insurance settlement he got in an auto accident 
he said that when he came home at night he would throw his 
change into the metal box 
the change out of your pocket grew to 15000 in your house 
asked keker north replied affirmatively 
keker intimated that the money that paid for the vehicle a 
chevrolet suburban with 51000 miles on the odometer came from the 
fund financed with travelers checks from contra leader adolfo 
calero 
the fund was to pay expenses of rebel leaders when they were in 
this country and to support the iran armssales initiative north 
is accused of illegally converting 4300 of those checks to his 
own use although not in connection with the used vehicle 
keker also questioned whether north might have gotten some of 
the money for the vehicle from codefendant richard secord whose 
office is near the auto dealership in tysons corner va 
this car has nothing to do with calero or secord but with the 
fund that ollie north set up in 1967 the witness said firmly 
there had been previous testimony that calero put 90000 to 
100000 travelers checks into the contra fund and secord 
contributed 150000 to 200000 cash 
i understood perfectly clearly what the purpose of that money 
was north said it was to support two operations and thats 
what it was used for 
do you remember being tempted to use the travelers checks for 
your personal use 
never once north shot back

three california businessmen charged in 
the pentagon corruption scandal knew more than they wanted to 
admit they knew about a scheme to bribe a navy engineer a 
prosecutor said today shortly before the case went to the jury 
assistant us attorney jack hanly said in his closing argument 
that the defendants eugene sullivan george kaub and dale 
schnittjer were aware that a private consultant they had hired 
was paying bribes to obtain information about a lucrative radar 
contract 
but defense attorney mark tuohey representing kaub tried to 
pick apart the governments case by pointing out that the main 
witnesses had pleaded guilty in exchange for lesser sentences and 
were cooperating with the government 
the defendants all former executive vice presidents of teledyne 
electronics of newbury park calif are accused of conspiracy 
bribery and wire fraud in the first trial stemming from the 
governments nearly 3yearold investigation of kickbacks and 
bribery in the pentagons purchasing system 
us district judge richard williams explained the charges to 
the jury of four women and eight men before the panel began 
deliberating the charges in the weeklong trial in early afternoon 
tuohey said kaub had no idea that william parkin the private 
consultant hired by teledyne electronics had paid money to stuart 
berlin a navy engineer for details about a 24 million contract 
that teledyne won to make handheld radar sets parkin and berlin 
are among those who pleaded guilty in exchange for helping the 
government 
the governments witnesses had every motive in the world to 
save their skin touhey argued each came into the 
courtroom under immunity promising to cooperate with the 
prosecution with a hammer over their heads 
but tuohey said his client was in the dark a victim of a 
conspiracy between parkin berlin and two other men their only 
motive was to get everything you can and dont tell anybody about 
it he said 
but prosecutor hanly said of the defendants they knew more 
than they wanted to admit they knew 
the businessmen who worked with parkin to ensure he received a 
150000 contract after teledyne electronics was awarded the radar 
job adopted a stance of not pressing for too much information he 
said their posture in dealing with parkin was dont tell me any 
more youve told me enough he said 
during the trial the jury heard taperecorded conversations 
between parkin and the defendants obtained from wiretaps

a small town school board asked a federal 
appeals court monday to let it reinstate a ban on dancing but 
dance advocates argued that students should be allowed to remain 
footloose 
the rule against dancing may not be smart or reasonable but 
that doesnt mean its unconstitutional said ransom ellis iii of 
springfield attorney for the purdy school board in southwestern 
missouri 
an opposing attorney argued that such a ban would be a 
constitutional violation 
both sides presented oral arguments before a threejudge panel 
of the 8th us circuit court of appeals the court took the case 
under advisement and will rule later 
the purdy school board is appealing us district judge russell 
g clarks ruling in august that the nearly centuryold ban on 
dancing on school property violated the constitutional amendment 
regarding the separation of church and state 
after clarks ruling students made history in december with a 
homecoming dance in the school gymnasium and now juniors and 
seniors are planning a may prom at school 
ellis and the school board have maintained that the ban was a 
question of policy and had nothing to do with religion 
there is no religious purpose here said ellis there is 
no evidence that the policy advances religion 
attorney larry m schumaker of kansas city who was brought into 
the case by the american civil liberties union on behalf of 
students maintained that religion was the sole reason for the 
nodance rule 
there is no valid secular reason for the rule said 
schumaker we asked the board to give us a valid secular reason 
for the rule they finally said they were just going along with 
public opinion 
clark awarded about 80000 in attorneys fees and expenses to 
schumaker and lawyer william fleischaker of joplin

the soviet navy has found its nuclear submarine at 
the bottom of the frigid norwegian sea and believes electrical 
problems may have caused a fire and explosions that sank it a 
newspaper reported monday 
the government newspaper izvestia said rescuers had found the 
bodies of 19 of the 42 sailors killed when the sub sank north of 
norway on friday 
tass the official news agency said the 27 survivors were 
hospitalized in serious condition at murmansk a soviet arctic 
port and investigators were able to interview them for only 
minutes at a time 
it also said a government commission praised the crew for 
bravely and intelligently working to shut down the subs 
nuclear reactor 
according to preliminary information the fire started because 
of a short circuit izvestia said quoting navy investigators in 
murmansk it said the submarine carried 10 torpedoes two of them 
nucleartipped 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov and the 
newspaper reiterated previous soviet statements that there was no 
danger of radioactivity being released from the torpedoes or the 
reactor 
izvestia said search crews had determined the subs location but 
gerasimov said whether it could be raised was not yet known 
the question of lifting the submarine up has not been decided 
yet he told a news briefing its a bit deep there 
norwegian defense officials in oslo said the soviets had a 
salvage vessel at the site but spokesman erik senstad there was no 
indication whether an attempt would be made to raise the sub from 
nearly 5000 feet below the surface 
we dont even know if the salvage vessel would be capable of 
salvaging anything senstad told the associated press we are 
skeptical about the idea that the soviets are preparing a salvage 
operation the vessels may just have been relatively nearby 
he said civilian salvers have raised wrecks and parts of wrecks 
from much deeper water however and the soviets presumably would 
want to retrieve the sub 
vadim rozanov press attache at the embassy in oslo said soviet 
vessels were in the area to test for radiation paralleling studies 
by norwegian scientists but i dont know if there are any plans 
to salvage the submarine 
if the ship was a mikeclass vessel as believed in the west it 
would contain some of the most advanced soviet technology which 
the kremlin would not want disclosed to nato countries the 
norwegian news agency ntb reported 
norway prepared 10 questions for the soviets about the subs 
construction and reactor safeguards 
we are not trying to pry into their military secrets but we 
are concerned about other circumstances of safety said sigrid 
romundset foreign ministry spokeswoman 
among topics addressed were the reactor cooling system what 
radioactive waste they produce and the strength of the protective 
casing around the reactors 
members of the committee on radiation accidents created after 
the explosion and fire at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the 
soviet ukraine in april 1986 drafted the norwegian questions 
in denmark the environmental group greenpeace said a violent 
chemical reaciton and explosion might result if the reactors were 
cooled by fluid sodium and it made contact with sea water 
izvestia quoted defense minister dmitri t yazov as saying the 
crew heard several explosions after two or three hours of trying 
to control the fire 
it may be supposed that with the increased pressure on the 
sub special devices began to explode he said there were a 
total of seven of them on board it is possible that the body of 
the sub cracked in some places 
he did not describe the special devices 
soviet media said previously the fire started in the subs 
seventh section and spread to the sixth but neither section was 
identified further 
tass said earlier the submarines captain e vanin was among 
the dead izvestia said the log was saved and investigators were 
studying it 
four sailors went down with the sub the paper said and two 
pulled from the water died later it said rescue teams had found 
only 19 bodies and continued searching 
those who were saved are in serious condition izvestia 
said one was in icy water more than an hour 
investigators found no fault with the effort to put out the 
fire tass reported 
the sailors fought for the life of the ship until the last 
minute and when the end came they managed to shut down the reactor 
and guarantee full radioactive safety it said

when lifelong democrat john kenneth galbraith 
received an embossed invitation from vice president dan quayle to 
join the gops exclusive senatorial inner circle the economist 
hastened to accept 
but thus far weve not received his check for 1000 so his 
acceptance sounds a little hollow quayle spokesman david 
beckwith said monday 
politicians on both sides of the fence have been chuckling over 
galbraiths wry response to the mixup that spawned his invitation 
to join the group whose annual dues go toward getting republican 
candidates elected to the senate 
about onethird of the inner circles 6000 members were in 
washington on monday for various briefings and a cocktail party at 
the vice presidents residence 
i dont think mr galbraith will be there said wendy 
democker a spokeswoman for the republican party offshoot 
but we dont really consider his invitation a mistake in that 
a number of very prominent republicans were once democrats she 
added look at ronald reagan 
galbraith who supported gov michael s dukakis 1988 
presidential bid was an unlikely target for a republican 
fundraising groups direct mail form letter 
but once the pitch was made the democrat latched onto it 
responding not a little sardonically to the invitation that arrived 
on vice presidential stationery 
it was very nice indeed of sen john chafee to nominate me 
for membership galbraith wrote in a letter part of an exchange 
reprinted in the boston globe there are one or two things that 
do trouble me 
galbraith went on to give quayle a lecture on the ethics of 
offering duespayers access to privileged closed door briefings 
you are either offering information for moneymaking purposes 
that is not available to the public at large or you are guilty of a 
certain fraud in giving the impression that there will be such 
advantage he wrote 
he also issued the 41yearold vice president a tongue lashing 
for what some consider a grammatical faux pas 
in your letter you say that marilyn quayle and i would like 
to personally invite you to the vice presidents residence the 
letter reads i will counsel you as a leader in a great 
englishspeaking country against so ungracious a use of the split 
infinitive 
chafee who quayle said had sponsored galbraiths nomination 
said he had met the harvard university professor on occasion and 
found him a pleasant man but the rhode island republican still 
couldnt explain how the liberals name was picked up by the 
republican fund raisers 
as soon as i saw that arnold schwarzenegger and mario andretti 
were on the list of inner circle members galbraiths name just 
leapt to mind chafee said tongueincheek 
beckwith said the gop had suffered similar computer hijinks in 
the past but that it was all to the greater good 
when you deal with mailing lists you have to accept a few 
inappropriate recipients he said its happened before with a 
few other nonlogical people but none quite so prominent as john 
kenneth galbraith

which is in town through april 23 
keeping them in line tailstotrunks was whipwielding gunther 
gebelwilliams the animal trainer who is calling this his final

two street cleaners followed the parade brushing and spraying 
away evidence of the elephants passing 
predictably some motorists were not amused laying on their

fraternity pledges roused sleepers from 
their beds and a pizza parlor closed early to provide some of the 
2145 swimmers who took a lap in a pool to set a oneday relay 
record 
the 19hour marathon at hamilton college last weekend apparently 
broke the previous mark in the guinness book of world records set 
in april 1986 by 2135 swimmers each of whom swam one lap at the 
syracuse ymca 
by 1230 am sunday organizers were still more than 100 
swimmers shy of the mark said jeff vanburen a junior at the 
college who also participated in the syracuse event 
we sent all pledges on campus to wake people up and go to 
parties to round up more people van buren said 
a pizza shop closed early so its eight workers could each swim a 
lap around 130 am he said 
the college in central new york has about 1700 students and 
clinton has another 2100 residents 
the feat at hamilton to be verified by guiness book officials 
before it would replace the previous record

former congressman mario biaggi who 
served 10 terms in the house of representatives entered a federal 
prison monday to begin serving a 2year term for accepting an 
illegal gift 
biaggi 71 maintained he broke no law by accepting a florida 
vacation from former new york city democratic boss meade esposito 
i find myself going to a federal facility today because a 
friend of some 35 years was generous to me biaggi said sunday 
before boarding a plane at newark nj 
the former hero policeman arrived late sunday at dallasfort 
worth international airport and reported to the us correctional 
facility a minimum security prison housing 855 inmates about 1 
am said warden ron burkhart 
biaggi received institutional clothing and was assigned a place 
to live at the prison a former hospital he was to receive several 
days of orientation a physical examination and be assigned a job 
burkhart said 
everybody does something that is reflective of his abilities 
or restrictions burkhart said were like a town within a 
town 
at newark biaggi said he had served his constituents well and 
would return to pick up where we left off 
biaggi who parlayed a record as the most highly decorated 
police officer in new york city history into a successful political 
career was convicted in september 1987 
he also was later convicted in the wedtech defense contractor 
scandal and received an eightyear sentence to be served after the 
term he began monday 
before flying to texas biaggi spent the weekend fielding calls 
from wellwishers and attended a farewell party saturday he also

scientists trying to duplicate a 
university of utah experiment that appeared to achieve nuclear 
fusion said today they obtained a similar outcome but arent sure 
whether it really was caused by fusion 
this is only one aspect the excess energy aspect has been 
confirmed said charles martin associate chemistry professor at 
texas aampm university who is working with thermodynamics researchers 
bruce gammon and kenneth marsh on the experiments 
the scientists cautioned that further research must be done to 
confirm that the excess heat generated in the experiment was the 
result of nuclear fusion and not merely an unexplained chemical 
reaction 
i would feel a lot more comfortable if we detected fusion and 
we have not yet martin said 
the experiment one of several similar experiments continuing at 
texas aampm began on friday and has been running for as much as 40 
hours 
b stanley pons one of the two researchers whose announcement 
on the fusion experiment march 23 in utah created a sensation in 
scientific circles today praised his texas counterparts 
the results reported by the scientists at texas aampm are very 
encouraging and are almost precisely the same as those we have 
reported pons chairman of the university of utahs chemistry 
department said in a statement we extended our congratulations 
to these careful scientists 
pons said he sees the texas findings as very good news and 
said he expected increased efforts by scientists around the world 
to confirm the experiment now that texas aampms results are in many 
scientists had expressed profound skepticism that fusion could be 
achieved without superhigh heat as the utah researchers claimed 
referring to the excess heat produced by the texas aampm 
researchers pons said we look forward to seeing the heatpower 
levels that they are able to obtain 
pons and his colleague martin fleischmann of the university of 
southampton england had reported getting four times as much heat 
out of the experiment than they put in while the texas researchers 
found a smaller increase in heat 
marsh director of the themodynamics research center at texas 
aampm said the detection of the excess heat was possible because the 
school was using extremely sensitive measurement device known as a 
calorimeter 
the method that we have used is somewhat different from the 
method used by the utah group marsh said 
we have measured the energies using a calorimeter which 
compares directly the energy produced by the electrical heater to 
that produced by the electrochemical reaction 
in the experiments the researchers used a heater to warm a 
solution before reducing the heat and measuring a continuing 
increase in temperature the experiments yielded significantly more 
energy in the form of heat than they were putting into it in the 
form of electric current researchers said 
the texas researchers said they had spoken to their utah 
counterparts by phone and had compared notes but would exchange 
further information with them later this week at a scientific 
meeting in dallas 
scientists have been trying to unlock the secrets of nuclear 
fusion for decades because it holds the potential for providing a 
clean inexpensive and virtually inexhaustable supply of energy 
fusion occurs when the nuclei of atoms are joined together 
creating heat it is the energy source that powers the sun and 
hydrogen bombs the energy produced by nuclear power plants comes 
from fission which splits atoms 
scientists have thought it requires extremely high heat to 
achieve fusion 
but last month pons and fleischmann claimed to have sustained a 
controlled fusion reaction at room temperature using equipment 
found in any college laboratory they claimed to have produced four 
times as much energy as they put in their experiment 
steven jones of brigham young university in utah said recently 
he had achieved fusion in a similar experiment but obtained far 
less energy than pons and fleischmann claimed 
last week two hungarian scientists claimed to have duplicated 
the utah results hungarys official mti news agency reported 
last week the utah legislature approved an additional 5 
million to develop and patent the new fusion process to be spent 
only if the experiment is confirmed

moslem guerrillas who besieged 
jalalabad five weeks ago have attacked with new fury launching 
18000 rockets and shells at the city in 24 hours the government 
said monday 
this big offensive was launched from afar on the city backed 
by pakistani artillery a foreign ministry statement said 
throughout the siege the marxist government has sought to 
portray the battle as being fought 15 to 30 miles from jalalabad 
without close combat its latest statement appears to contradict 
that by saying the enemy tried to retake positions they had lost 
during the battl without success 
as described officially the guerrilla bombardment would be one 
of the heaviest in the fight for jalalabad the first major 
guerrilla offensive launched after completion of the soviet 
military withdrawal feb 15 
government reports on the fighting in the past three weeks 
indicated the daily total of shells and rockets fired at jalalabad 
the capital of nagarhar province 75 miles east of kabul had not 
exceeded 12000 
no confirmation of battle reports is possible because foreign 
journalists are not allowed into the area which is about 45 miles 
from the pakistan border 
the foreign ministry statement given to western reporters by 
telephone said soldiers killed 112 enemy fighters in the 24 hours 
ending at sundown monday including an arab adviser and 70 
were wounded it reported 11 civilians and three government 
soldiers killed and 40 shops destroyed 
it is not known how many people remain in jalalabad which 
government statistics say had a population of 64600 two years ago 
thousands have fled since the siege began march 6 
as usual the government said the guerrillas were assisted by 
pakistani militiamen and wahhabis tied to saudi arabia both 
nations deny direct involvement in the war 
the wahhabi sect of islam is predominant in saudi arabia but a 
small minority in afghanistann where 80 percent of the population 
follow the mainstream sunni branch 
wahhabis are a subgroup in the sunni sect and president najib 
has sought to portray them as heretics 
saudi arabia the united states pakistan and china are the 
major supporters of the guerrillas who began fighting after a 
communist coup in april 1978 soviet military forces entered the 
war in december 1979

putting oliver north on the witness stand at 
his trial was a risky but probably essential strategy to counter 
charges he lied to congress and personally profited from the 
irancontra affair 
the decision by north and his defense lawyers was probably 
predetermined by the nature of the charges against the former 
marine lieutenant colonel and his proven abilities as a witness 
because of his centrality to the entire case ollie north 
you almost might say really could not not testify because of who 
he is and what he is said joseph digenova a former us attorney 
in the nations capital 
a charismatic speaker whose voice often cracked during emotional 
points in his story north won a wide national following when he 
testified for six days in 1987 during televised congressional 
hearings on the irancontra affair he appeared as a sympathetic 
and forceful defender of his actions 
eliciting that sympathy from the jury which will decide his fate 
is a crucial task for the defense north was probably the best 
witness to make his case that he was acting with the full support 
and authority of his superiors including president reagan 
i felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants 
he told the jury explaining why he felt a duty to lie to congress 
about secret us military aid to the nicaraguan contras at a time 
which such aid was illegal 
north said he didnt think it was wrong to lie because he was 
concealing activities that i was told could not should not be 
revealed 
but after telling his side for three days from witness stand 
north faced the obvious risks monday as associate independent 
counsel john w keker began crossexamination 
weighing the gains versus the losses that a skilled prosecutor 
can exact on crossexamination is the dilemma all defense attorneys 
face in a criminal trial 
the defendant must answer all questions put to him and a 
skilled prosecutor could bring out damaging admissions from a 
defendant crossexamination can thus give the prosecution an 
opportunity to shore up weak parts of its case by adding to proof 
not available from other sources 
the normal rule is you do not want your client to testify a 
client can hurt himself more than he can help himself said 
washington defense lawyer e lawrence barcella 
but barcella said the rule is filled with exceptions that 
may well include the north case 
a lot of times a call whether or not to take that risk is 
based upon how you are doing by the end of the governments case 
and your gut feeling as to how risky it is for this defendant 
to take the stand said randall j turk another washington 
defense lawyer 
turk faced that dilemma when he helped defend former white house 
aide michael k deaver who was convicted of lying under oath about 
his lobbying activities deaver did not testify at his trial 
nor did lyn nofziger a former white house aide convicted of 
ethicslaw violations who was represented by barcella 
but in some whitecollar criminal cases sometimes its 
obvious you have to call the defendant turk says 
so much of whats going on in a whitecollar crime case are 
questions of a persons honesty and integrity turk said 
usually the cases involve the gray area between something that is 
clearly right and clearly wrong 
the real issue in the cases is the intent of the defendant 
turk said the jury is usually very interested in hearing from 
the defendant so they can make an assessment 
barcella said one factor is often whether a defense can be built 
from other witnesses 
in this particular case there isnt anybody who can really 
explain it as well as he can said barcella there are a number 
of counts he cant really get anybody else to help him with 
these include a charge north accepted installation of a 13800 
security fence outside his great falls va home in violation of a 
law that bars federal employees from accepting gratuities 
north told jurors that he sought help from armsdealer richard 
v secord when federal officials declined to give his family 
protection in 1986 after a terrorist group targeted him as an enemy 
the bottom line of the discussion was that there isnt a lot 
we can do for you you are too junior north told jurors 
i intended to pay for it he said but acknowledged i did 
not 
while barcella said he found north a very persuasive and 
convincing witness before congress the courtroom setting is very 
different 
on capitol hill barcella said nobody really took control of 
north and shut him down when he gave rambling answers 
once he started looking like a fairly sympathetic figure for 
political reasons none of the congressmen or senators really 
wanted to jump in his face barcella said 
that wont be the case at his trial which is under the tight 
control of us district judge gerhard a gesell 
judge gesell controls the courtroom barcella said the 
jury isnt going to hold against the government what judge gesell 
does to control oliver north

national drug policy director william j 
bennett announced today a multimilliondollar federal effort to 
crack down on drugrelated crime in the nations capital saying 
the district of columbia government has failed to serve its 
citizens 
already in the first four months of 1989 the city has seen 135 
new murders bennett told a news conference and that problem 
is getting worse not better 
under the plan approved today by president bush the federal 
bureau of prisons will immediately accept 250 prisoners housed in 
the local jail a 500bed pretrial detention facility will be 
built within one year and a 700bed federal prison will be 
constructed for the washingtonbaltimore area 
a washingtonarea drug task force will get an additional 57 
federal state and local investigators under the plan including 25 
fbi agents and 11 drug enforcement administration agents 
five defense department intelligence analysts will also be 
assigned to the task force which will concentrate on identifying 
crack distributors in the washington area 
the effort will cost 70 million to 80 million bennett said 
adding that the money would be redeployed from other uses by 
the departments involved he did not say what current programs the 
money would come from 
bennett said the plan should not be considered an assault on 
the principle of home rule but he criticized the district of 
columbia governments handling of the problem of drugrelated 
violence 
the plain fact is that for too long and in too many respects 
the dc government has failed to serve its citizens bennett 
said 
he noted that congress appropriated 50 million three years ago 
for a new detention facility in washington but no ground has yet 
been broken on the project 
as a result he said thousands of people arrested for drug 
and other serious crimes in this city regularly go free 
of course drugs and demand for drugs sorely test responsive 
abilities of dozens of american cities bennett said but here 
where the problem is so glaring so out of control serious 
questions of local politics and governance can no longer be avoided 
or excused they must be answered 
mayor marion barry jr said he welcomed the extra federal help 
in the drug war but abruptly left a news conference before 
reporters could ask him about bennetts criticisms of his 
government 
we welcome the idea of washington being a model in the war on 
drugs barry said we look forward to a long working 
relationship 
we dont feel that the city has failed in its management in 
this area said city administrator carol thompson who fielded 
questions after the mayors sudden departure 
barry has been dogged by allegations that he has used drugs and 
by charges against a former associate charles lewis of 
drugselling in the virgin islands barry visited lewis several 
times at a washington hotel in december the mayor has repeatedly 
denied using drugs or having any knowledge of any possible drug 
connection involving lewis 
in addition to the law enforcement plans the program outlined 
today called for the department of housing and urban development to 
ease regulations on the eviction of drug offenders from federally 
funded housing projects 
also the department of health and human services is to 
establish three model outpatient drug clinics in the city that 
will provide at least 300 new treatment slots by 1990 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush had 
reviewed bennetts plans this morning and the president urges 
that all agencies of government federal and local pull together 
to use these ideas and others in solving the ongoing drugrelated 
crime problem in the district of columbia 
he said the proposals represent a beginning in the joint 
federalstatelocal campaign against drug abuse focused on 
washington 
while director bennetts proposals may not be popular they do 
represent a coming to terms with the hard issues the spokesman 
said 
america is being tested by the drug epidemic fitzwater 
said and a big part of that test is whether or not were willing 
to adopt many of the difficult measures required in fighting 
drugrelated crime 
fitzwater said bush was letting bennett serve as the lead 
spokesman on the plan and that the president wont comment on 
individual measures 
its bill bennetts plan he said the president has 
reviewed it and approved it in a general sense these are 
specific items that are in a series of initiatives 
fitzwater said the initiatives will be subject to negotiation 
and discussion with leaders of the district of columbia and 
officials of suburban jurisdictions saying that the federal 
government cannot impose such a plan on the local governments 
there will be negotiations and discussions with the groups and 
well ee how the process ticks he said many of these things 
are going to be done over a number of years some are going to be 
done immediately 
fitzwater said bush has highest confidence in local 
jurisdictions but we want everybody to work together to bring 
their expertise to bear on this problem its a very fluid type of 
situation

four nurses who confessed to 49 mercy 
killings of elderly patients plugged the noses of some victims 
and forced water into their lungs police said monday 
police said they doubted the nurses claim that they killed the 
patients to relieve their suffering because of the way the victims 
died 
the first slayings took place in 1983 in a ward of lainz 
hospital but most of them occurred in the last two years police 
said 
the ward dubbed the death pavilion was closed monday 
and police were checking hospital records 
police chief guenter boegl said the nurses gave the patients 
who reportedly ranged in age from 75 to 80 forced water into the 
lungs of some victims or gave overdoses of insulin or tranquilizers 
to others 
police sources said in at least 23 cases the nurses would plug 
victims noses and force water down their throats to induce death 
by forcing fluid in the lungs 
the nurses identified as maria gruber 25 irene leidolf 27 
waltraud wagner 30 and stephanie mayer 50 are in custody but 
no formal charges had been filed by late monday 
three of the nurses were arrested friday and the fourth sunday 
police said each nurse knew the others were killing patients 
investigators said in a few cases two nurses would act together 
ms wagner acknowledged killing 22 patients with water police 
said a police spokesman said ms mayer who was arrested sunday 
confessed to killing five patients one of them with water 
all are in investigative custody after being arrested on 
suspicion of murder and attempted murder but no formal charges 
have so far been filed pending completion of the investigation 
the police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for a 
fifth nurse who is on vacation but some reports said she may be 
innocent and have been implicated in revenge by one of those 
arrested 
the fifth nurse reportedly told doctors a year ago about a 
suspicious death at the hospital but an investigation was 
inconclusive 
one police investigator said the nurses also admitted to killing 
patients they considered a nuisance 
there were fears that the number of victims might still rise 
under investigators review are hospital records from 1982 to 1988 
when 3126 people died in the hospital 
officials rejected charges that doctors had failed to supervise 
the nurses properly 
fritz gschneit who was appointed hospital director on monday 
said it was thanks to the alertness of the doctors that the 
slayings could be discovered 
erhard busek a city counselor of the austrian peoples party 
said the city council should hold a special meeting to discuss the 
entire health system and called for a committee to probe the 
hospital scandal

ethiopia says it wont permit planned 
relief shipments into southern sudan cutting off a key part of an 
effort to avert starvation a un official said monday 
it came as a bit of a shock said vincent oreilly one of 
the coordinators of operation lifeline sudan it aims to provide 
170000 tons of food and supplies to 25 million southern sudanese 
displaced by civil war and facing starvation 
the effort aims to prevent a repetition of the tragedy in 1988 
when an estimated 250000 to 500000 people died it hopes to move 
the supplies before midmay when seasonal rains are expected to 
render roads and airstrips unusable 
the united nations had hoped to obtain and move 20000 metric 
tons of food into southern sudan from ethiopia one of operation 
lifelines eight routes 
however ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam over the 
weekend sent a telex to unicef chief james grant in new york saying 
he could not accomodate the request said carlton james a unicef 
spokesman in nairobi grant said april 3 he had received assurances 
from ethiopian officials 
it was not immediately clear why ethiopia is blocking passage 
the ethiopia operation has been canned oreilly said 
un officials now hope to move the emergency supplies through 
one of the operations other corridors possibly the route from 
kenya that already is slated to handle 25000 tons of food and 
supplies by road and air 
however oreilly said aircraft still have not been donated and 
the kenyan operation could fail without them 
we are completely dependent on an integrated support system 
said oreilly it will succeed or fail based on whether we get a 
combination of air and road transport also only 80 million of 
the 132 million needed for the operation has been pledged he said 
operation lifeline began april 1 after the sudanese government 
and rebel sudan peoples liberation army agreed to allow the 
emergency aid to move unhampered to rebelcontrolled and 
governmentheld towns in southern sudan 
some relief officials estimate as many as 2 million people may 
have died since sudans war broke out in 1983 mostly civilians 
driven from their homes who either died seeking shelter or starved 
to death in refugee camps and besieged towns

three north koreans are attending an academic 
conference in the united states under a new us policy designed to 
reduce tensions on the korean peninsula an official said monday 
the three arrived late last week for a conference at the 
university of hawaii and will probably visit other academic centers 
in the united states as well said the state department official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the decision to let north koreans visit the united states was 
part of a policy shift adopted last october at the request of south 
korea 
the us ally hoped that a gesture from washington would 
encourage more openness by the north korean government toward its 
southern neighbor and archrival although contacts so far between 
the sides have not yielded significant progress 
the united states does not have diplomatic ties with north 
korea listing it among a handful of countries that support 
terrorism 
nonetheless the new us policy lifted a ban on contacts with 
north korean officials outside the united states and three 
meetings have been held so far between american and north korean 
diplomats in beijing the last meeting was feb 28 said the 
official 
he said the meetings amounted to an exchange of views and could 
not be termed negotiations although further meetings are expected

the air force has paid lockheed corp more 
than 26 million for 47 repair kits for its c5 cargo planes and 
may buy 100 more despite warnings that the kits are overpriced a 
newspaper reported 
items in the kits include a business cardsized metal plate 
priced at 114 and a splicer costing 362 the dayton daily news 
said sunday citing an air force cost analysts report 
the kits are designed to fix the aircrafts landing gear main 
frames outer wings and wheel wells and part of its lower 
fuselage in the event of a major crash the newspaper said 
according to internal air force memos and reports obtained by 
the newspaper air force officials have questioned the cost of and 
the need for the kits as well as the decision to buy them from 
lockheed 
capt kathy johnson a costprice analyst visited a lockheed 
plant in marietta ga last june and later recommended reviewing 
the kits 6000 types of parts 
ms johnson cited apparent overpricing and warned it could lead 
to negative publicity for the air force the daily news said 
eric m thorson an assistant air force secretary echoed her 
fears in a memo one month later after learning that a limited 
review of the orders found 39 percent of the parts to be 
overpriced the newspaper said 
col allan v cummings a spokesman for the air force logistics 
command at wright patterson air force base in dayton said the 
figures cited were only lockheeds proposed prices 
the air force should not be chastised for paying prices that 
weve not finally agreed upon he said 
lt gen claudius e watts iii the comptroller of the air 
force noted in a memo that money and kits were changing hands

political turmoil in iran is likely to prevent 
significant progress in a new round of peace talks with iraq 
expected to be held soon an exiled iranian said monday 
shahram chubin an exiled iranian historian said that with two 
of his senior aides losing their posts in the past few weeks 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran would probably stick to 
a hardline course rather than expose himself to criticism at home 
and of course iraq would have little incentive to offer too 
much if it is not getting an response said chubin who worked at 
the london institute for strategic studies before taking a teaching 
post at genevas prestigious graduate institute of international 
affairs 
iranian foreign ministry officials and un officials met last 
week to lay groundwork for a new round of talks between velayati 
and his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz they have agreed to hold the 
talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near un 
headquarters in new york but no date has been set the talks have 
been deadlocked since november over irans insistence that iraqi 
troops withdraw from iranian territory while iraq insists that the 
first step should be the clearing of war debris from the shatt 
alarab waterway on the border 
before a unbrokered un agreement last august at least 1 
million people were killed or wounded in the eightyear persian 
gulf war some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1 million and 
the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of dollars 
in an interview with the associated press chubin noted that 
ousted deputy foreign minister javad mohammad larijani and jaffar 
mahallati irans un ambassador were both associates of 
velayati he also said there is some uncertainty whether velayati 
himself will last 
chubin said pragmatists in the foreign ministry are now 
struggling to push their views while radicals like interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashami are making as much capital as 
possible 
the historian predicted that khomeini will avoid a definitive 
stand sometimes taking one side and sometimes the other 
khomeini is too clever to entrust the future of the islamic 
republic to one faction he said 
also in geneva the international committee of the red cross 
said 66 iraqi prisoners of war were repatriated on monday after 
their unilateral release by iran 
the genevabased humanitarian agency said the prisoners were all 
wounded sick or elderly four other prisoners refused to be 
repatriated and remained in iran it said 
iran had said it would free the prisoners to mark the 10th 
anniversary of the founding of the islamic republic 
more than 100000 war prisoners are still held by iran and iraq 
according to red cross estimates only 2295 have been released 
since the ceasefire

the environmental protection agency said 
monday more than a million school water fountains still have lead 
components or leadlined tanks posing possible health risks to 
youngsters 
epa officials said they would soon issue a detailed guide for 
school officials on how to test for unhealthy lead levels and the 
agency listed 113 manufactuers model numbers for fountains in 
which lead levels were found to be of concern 
the officials emphasized that school water fountains likely 
account for only a very small part of the lead exposure that 
youngsters face and they said it was uncertain whether the high 
lead levels in some coolers were from the coolers or water pipes 
nevertheless said mike cook director of the epas office of 
water contamination the agency urged school officials to test 
cited coolers especially those in which tanks were found to be 
lined with lead 
we found very high levels of lead in these leadlined 
tanks said cook 
the epa has no authority to order the testing but a law enacted 
last year requires states to begin a program to assist school 
districts in testing for lead in drinking water school officials 
in many states already have testing programs under way officials 
said 
lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low 
levels of exposure it can cause damage to the brain and nervous 
system and lead to learning disabilities hearing impairment and 
interference in the formation of red blood cells according to the 
epa 
the epa considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion in water 
to pose health risks especially if a child is exposed to lead from 
other sources as well the agency estimates lead in drinking water 
typically accounts for about 20 percent of the total exposure in 
young children 
we think that there are a few hundred thousand children who 
have enough lead from other sources so when lead from drinking 
water is added at levels of 20 parts per billion there will be some 
adverse health impact said cook in an interview 
while the agency gave no specific levels of lead in water from 
all the coolers cited by model number it said the coolers were 
singled out only after levels were found to be in the unhealthy 
range 
in coolers with leadlined tanks the levels were more than 
several hundred parts per billion and in some cases when 
longstanding water was tested the level was more than 1000 parts 
per billion according to cook in the other coolers cited by the 
epa often only a single soldering connector brought lead into 
contact with the water 
the agency said it had no estimate on how many coolers with 
leadlined tanks are still being used in schools cook in an 
interview said the epa stumbled upon the tanks all on coolers 
made by halsey taylor co when examining 22 water coolers 
provided by the us navy 
nine of the navy coolers were found to have leadlined tanks 
causing the epa to become concerned cook said similar water 
coolers are used in schools and that the epa received two such 
coolers from school officials in portland maine 
the new law requires the epa to issue detailed guidelines on how 
to detect lead contamination in school water systems as well as 
provide a list of the brand and models of water coolers that have 
lead components there also is a timetable for eliminating those 
coolers or correcting the problem 
the coolers cited by model number were manufacturers by three 
companies halsey taylor ebco manufacturing co and sunroc corp 
the epa said two other companies have yet to reply to inquiries on 
lead content in their coolers and a third said it produced no 
coolers with lead components 
cook said that lead in school drinking fountains is only one of 
many sources causing health risks to children lead contamination 
more often comes from the use of lead solder in pipes that carry 
the water children also can be exposed to lead in the air and in 
paint although such exposure has been reduced with the gradual 
elimination of leaded gasoline and lead paint

mayor teddy kollek told foreign mayors monday 
at a conference on ethnic conflict in cities that jerusalems jews 
moslems and christians will never integrate 
however he also played down the impact on jerusalem of the 
16month palestinian uprising in the occupied lands saying 
there are tensions but they are less than you see on your tv 
during the uprising 422 palestinians and 18 israelis have been 
killed including two arabs and a jew in jerusalem israel seized 
arab east jerusalem when it captured the occupied territories from 
arab neighbors in the 1967 middle east war and it later made the 
city its capital 
in the conference kollek described the problems of governing 
jerusalem for about 30 mayors from 16 countries including the 
united states 
well always have jews moslems and christians in this city 
kollek said but unlike in other cities here they will never 
integrate it is not their purpose 
kollek said city officials must also deal with sometimes 
clashing christian denominations 
there are 40 different christian denominations in jerusalem 
sometimes these groups are very competitive amongst themselves over 
the holy places rights the times they are allowed to pray in 
various churches kollek said 
speaking after kolleks address mayor william boner of 
nashville tenn elicited laughter when he said mayor kollek 
after hearing you i dont think i have any ethnic conflicts in 
nashville 
in nashville boner said blacks make up about 22 percent of the 
citys population of about 500000 
as a group blacks in nashville are poor theyre less healthy 
they are more prone to crime and drug abuse boner said 
such disparity has produced resentment despair and crucial 
issues for we mayors 
mayor joanne benjamin of los gatos calif said one of the main 
challenges facing her city of 28000 people was providing education 
for the children of hispanic and vietnamese immigrants she said 
many speak little or no english

president bush signed legislaton monday 
expanding job protection to federal whistleblowers a revamped 
version of a measure vetoed late last year by thenpresident reagan 
the true whistleblower is a public servant of the highest 
order bush said at the signing ceremony in the old executive 
office building attended by the measures congressional sponsors 
the legislation will provide increased protection from firing 
and demotion for federal employees who disclose misdeeds and 
mismanagement in the agenices where they work 
bush called the bill a significant improvement over the one 
reagan vetoed 
the new measure does not contain a provison opposed by reagan 
that would have permitted the office of special counsel to go to 
court on behalf of whistleblowers reagan protested that this 
would have resulted in federal agencies battling each other in 
court 
under the new act employees fighting for their jobs would face 
less stringent standards of proof that their firing or demotion 
resulted from whistleblowing 
the office of the special counsel established eight years ago 
to investigate civil service abuses will become an independent 
agency under the new law the office now is an arm of the merit 
systems protection board and has been criticized in congress on 
grounds that it has done little to assist whistleblowers 
whistleblowers now will be able to take their cases directly to 
the board if the special counsel does not act within 120 days 
joining bush in the signing ceremony were the legislations 
coauthors sens carl levin dmich and rep frank horton 
rny and other sponsors 
we used to think of a whistleblower as some guy in a funny 
hat running around on a field with a blackandwhite shirt on 
always throwing down the flag bush said 
but that might well be an apt comparison to the business at 
hand because whistle blowing is after all the one who cries foul 
to waste fraud and abuse 
i share the determination of congress that we do everything 
possible to ensure that these dedicated men and women should not be 
fired or rebuked or suffer financially for their honesty and good 
judgment he added 
however in a separate statement bush also voiced confidence in 
agency heads 
although whistleblowers clearly can and do contribute to 
better government these managers respond regularly to a variety of 
problems including those disclosed by whistleblowers without 
special statutory provisons and procedures the statement said 
bush earlier in the day praised volunteers of another sort 
signing a proclamation at a rose garden ceremony making this 
national volunteer week 
youre winning because you refuse to believe that it cant be 
done he told an invited audience of individuals and 
representatives of various volunteer organizations 
i always like to remember that there is no exercise better for 
the human heart than reaching down and lifting someone else up 
bush said

a nations pain and outrage are being felt 
in the governors office where staffers have answered thousands of 
calls from americans touched by scenes of oilchoked animals on 
blackened beaches 
gov steve cowpers staff have answered as many as 1200 phone 
calls a day since the exxon valdez ruptured on a reef south of 
valdez on march 24 dumping 101 million gallons of oil into prince 
william sound 
the switchboard really lights up each day after the network tv 
news broadcasts on the east coast when its still early afternoon 
in juneau the most emotional calls come in response to televised 
scenes of dead or suffering animals 
people call here crying said laury roberts scandling 
cowpers director of constituent relations their first reaction 
is outrage and anger 
some offer sympathy or opinion ask how to help offer money 
others try to sell products to help in the cleanup 
the unusually hectic pace the oil spill has imposed on cowpers 
office has taken its toll on cowper and his staff of 20 
a lot of us are tired scandling said late last week our 
families dont see us people are tense and sometimes we all have 
to stop 
cowper came down with the flu late last week and had to work 
from the governors mansion for two days 
all of us have colds scandling said it really knocked 
cowper down 
cowpers wife michael has come in daily to answer calls with 
the seven staffers who share the duty andy spear a former state 
environmental official was hired to set up a callscreening 
procedure and field technical inquiries 
in addition to calls cowpers office each day has received 
about 50 spillrelated letters several telegrams product samples 
and countless messages on the office telecopier 
the fax goes 24 hours a day spear said 
one manufacturer mailed a bottle of crude oil and an absorbent 
to demonstrate the absorbents effectiveness it smelled up my 
office scandling said 
spear who used to head the states oilpollution control 
program refers the samples to officials on the spill scene some 
of the products have been used he said citing a cork material 
that had been adopted as an absorbent 
although spear said some suggestions border on the wacko 
even those are not immediately dismissed 
a california woman who suggested pouring dawn dishwashing liquid 
on the oil slick to break it up was not far off the mark that 
brand has long been used to clean oil off sea mammals and birds 
spear noted 
you never know he said i hate to discourage anyone who 
may have a good idea 
most of the letters however are lean on ideas and thick on 
emotions 
probably nine out of 10 letters begin with im sad im very 
angry im outraged scandling said 
a florida man wrote a terse letter to say had destroyed his 
exxon credit card a coloradan said he had canceled his 11week 
summer vacation in alaska although he knew it would not take him 
near prince william sound 
long ive heard about no taxes in alaska the oil people pay 
for everything he wrote well you sold your soul and now are 
paying the price

hundreds of abortion rights activists buoyed 
by the record turnout for their march on the capitol lobbied 
members of congress on monday as stalwarts of the womens movement 
predicted that their effort will leave a lasting impression on the 
supreme court 
that view however was not shared by at least one member of the 
bush administration vice president dan quayle 
the march was nothing unusual in this town he said i 
dont believe the supreme court should be nor do we expect it to 
be swayed by a demonstration that is not the way the system is 
supposed to work they are there to render a legal opinion 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said everyone 
has the right to march and present their views it appears that it 
was a very successful march over the weekend in terms of the number 
of people they wanted to get here they presented their views very 
effectively and thats good 
advocates who took part sunday in the largest abortion rights 
rally got their first taste of lobbying as they traveled from house 
offices to senate buildings delivering information packages 
containing a 30minute abortion for survival video and pressing 
their cases 
in most instances lawmakers were absent and activists met with 
congressional staff but the circumstances did little to dampen 
their enthusiasm 
wed like very much for him to see it jeanette d newsom 
of sylva nc told a staff member for republican sen jesse helms 
as her husband gene presented the packet 
the couple hes a farmer shes a librarian from the tiny 
town of 1700 near asheville have written helms in support of the 
equal rights amendment nuclear freeze and environmental issues 
they traveled from sylva to march in the demonstration and lobby in 
person 
after lobbying on the state level we naively assumed we could 
do it here in washington dc said gene newsom before the 
couple headed to the offices of north carolinas other senator 
democrat terry sanford 
hundreds of thousands of activists including mothers with small 
children hollywood stars and college students converged on the 
capitol to show their support for the 1973 supreme court decision 
that legalized abortion 
law enforcement officials estimated the crowd at 300000 but 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority put 
the total at 600000 
the turnout far exceeded the 90000 people who gathered for a 
march 1986 abortion rights rally in washington and the numbers 
organizers had predicted leaders said the response will have an 
impact on the supreme court 
nobody in public office isnt affected by a huge outpouring 
said molly yard president of the national organization for women 
questioned about lobbying members of congress rather than 
focusing on the court yard noted that lawmakers are in contact 
with the nine justices 
do you think the leadership in this body doesnt talk to the 
supreme court sure they do yard said do you think members of 
the bush administration dont talk to the supreme court sure they 
do 
francoise jacobsohn president of the new york city chapter of 
now said the congressional lobbying was a logical progression of 
what we did yesterday we have a political army 
we cannot stand for erosion we have been complacent said 
jacobsohn who said in the past the attitude has been we already 
fought this fight why do we have to fight it again 
activists plan to gather again on april 26 when the court will 
hear arguments in a missouri case that prochoice and antiabortion 
forces agree could significantly alter the ruling that gave women 
the right to an abortion

highranking government officials said monday at the opening day of 
her espionage trial that she gave state secrets to a soviet spy 
because she loved him 
federal prosecutors say defendant elke falk passed sensitive and 
secret documents to the kgb soviet intelligence service between 
1975 and 1985 
ms falk 44 said she began spying after falling in love with 
gerhard thieme who prosecutors say worked for the kgb she said 
thieme persuaded her to spy for him while the two were vacationing 
in communist east germany 
testifying before the northrhinewestphalia state supreme court 
in duesseldorf she said she delivered thieme documents about nato 
troop maneuvers in west germany 
ms falk told the court money played no role whatsover in 
her spying activities she said she instead hoped for a common 
future with gerhard 
court documents say she was paid about 270 on several 
occasions but even prosecutors have not described her motives in 
terms of greed 
she formerly worked for the state secretary of the federal 
chancellery and also held posts in the federal transportation and 
economic development ministries 
prosecutors said she gave the kgb copies of cabinet and security 
council minutes and also provided information on briefings compiled 
by the west german intelligence services

with basque separatists in algeria after a series of bombings 
believed to be the work of the basque group injured two people 
the latest injury occurred early monday when a mail bomb 
exploded at a military training school in the pyrenee mountain town 
of jaca sgt joaquin borbonado y ruez was injured and later had 
two fingers amputed a military statement in barcelona said 
the attacks began after the basque separatist group eta last 
week broke off a threemonth moratorium on attacks against 
government targets it had declared the moratorium april 4 in 
exchange for the talks in algiers 
the government with the agreement of the major political 
parties has attempted to carry on a dialogue that would lead to 
the elimination of violence in the basque country and the rest of 
spain interior minister jose luis corcuera told reporters 
unfortunately etas position of unilaterally ending the hopes 
raised to this end obliges the government to put an end to the 
dialogue 
in addition to the bomb at the military school police defused a 
mail bomb monday sent to julen elgorriaga a government official in 
vitoria the city is capital of the threeprovince basque region in 
northern spain

marched through the basque city of irun to protest a mail bomb that 
injured a high school gym teacher there on friday

authorities suspect eta

responsibility for eta for a series of rail bombings on saturday

eta has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 600 
people in its 21year campaign to secure selfdetermination for 
their region 
in his press briefing corcuera also said spain would continue 
to request international help in its fight against eta terrorism 
authorities in france have jailed or deported a number of 
highlevel eta members algeria has received some of those members 
but hinted recently that its hospitality might have limits if the 
talks fail 
eta says the government has failed to live up to its side of the 
agreements reached during the first phase of the talks which began 
in midjanuary 
the government of socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez said 
it was only prepared to discuss a way to end violence and how and 
when eta would lay down its arms it refused to enter into 
political negotiations on the future of the basque country and its 
21 million residents

british and australian soldiers were 
deployed monday in the north to monitor the pullout of nationalist 
guerrillas and officials said unsupervised independence 
elections would go ahead despite recent fighting 
the nearly 100 british and australian soldiers members of the 
un peacekeeping force arrived in the northern region of ovambo 
on monday for deployment at the checkpoints where guerrillas are to 
report tuesday before they return to bases in angola 
louis peinaar south africainstalled administrator of the 
territory said he expected unsupervised elections to be held as 
scheduled in early november provided that insurgents of the 
southwest africa peoples organization withdrew 
in the united nations the president of the security council 
said all parties concerned intend to stick to the procedures 
which were agreed on the turnover of namibia to a blackmajority 
government after 74 years of south african rule 
were looking forward once again to elections in namibia and 
to full independence said soviet ambassador alexander m 
belonogov who is council president this month 
chester crocker the us assistant secretary of state who 
mediated negotiations to clear the way for independence said in 
windhoek that diplomatic pressure has forced swapo to order the 
withdrawal 
south africa said 1900 guerrillas crossed the border from 
angola starting april 1 the day a ceasefire was to have taken 
effect heavy fighting continued for a week leaving 263 guerrillas 
and 27 security forces dead by south african count 
swapo leader sam nujoma ordered the insurgents to leave namibia 
on sunday crocker referring to this order said swapo didnt 
reverse itself voluntarily and indicated that angola and its 
cuban allies had persuaded nujoma to order the retreat 
starting tuesday the guerrillas are to report to border posts 
and assembly points so that members of the un monitoring force 
can escort them to bases in angola 
south african cuban and angolan officials agreed at a weekend 
meeting that the guerrillas could have safe passage out until 
saturday soviet and us officials including crocker observed 
the meeting at a namibian game lodge 
police reported calm in the northern bush for the second day 
monday and said they were waiting to see whether the guerrillas 
obeyed the withdrawal orders the lull follows the fiercest 
fighting in the 23year war for this mineralrich territory which 
south africa has ruled since world war i 
martti ahtisaari of finland the senior un official in 
namibia said messages were being broadcast on radio advising the 
guerrillas to go to churches as a preliminary step before reporting 
to the designated assembly points 
he told journalists no official ceasefire was in effect but 
the south africans have undertaken to restrain their forces 
ahtisaari declined to blame anyone for the nearcollapse of the 
independence plan 
there has been a major mistake made he said but my job 
is to build bridges and get this plan back on track 
the united nations has authorized a peacekeeping force of 4650 
soldiers for namibia but only about 1000 have arrived 
south africa contends swapos incursion violated an agreement 
that the insurgents would remain at bases at least 100 miles inside 
angola until midmay 
nujoma maintained that many of the guerrillas had been inside 
namibia before april and should be allowed to set up bases in the 
territory 
swapo had been favored to win the most votes in preindependence 
elections for an assembly that will draft a constitution 
the way for namibian independence was cleared in december when 
south africa angola and cuba signed a regional peace plan cuba 
agreed to withdraw 50000 cuban troops who have helped 
marxistruled angola battle usbacked rebels in exchange south 
africa agreed to stop supporting the angolan rebels and allow 
namibia to become independent

the city has sued conrail and monsanto co to 
recover the costs of cleaning up a train derailment and chemical 
spill that forced the evacuation of more than 10000 residents two 
years ago 
in the lawsuit filed friday in federal court the city said it 
spent about 225000 for police and fire protection evacuation of 
the bloomfield neighborhood and cleanup of the spill 
city solicitor dan pellegrini said monday the city had failed to 
negotiate a settlement with conrail and monsanto and was suing 
because the statute of limitations was running out 
adjacent allegheny county which pellegrini said had incurred 
about 25000 in expenses also has sued 
a conrail freight train derailed along a curve and knocked a 
second train carrying phosphorous oxychloride off parallel tracks 
in the april 11 1987 accident 
the chemical is a gasoline additive produced by monsanto that 
can react chemically with moisture in the lungs to produce 
hydrochloric acid 
bloomfield was evacuated twice on april 11 and april 12 and 70 
people were hospitalized for treatment of skin eye and lung 
irritation 
the lawsuit charges the defendants were negligent in failing to 
maintain and label their equipment in using an unsafe tank car and 
transporting the chemical through heavily populated areas 
monsanto attorney randy struk said a march 1988 study had 
determined that burning phonograph records from one of the freight 
cars caused the only major risk in the accident the records 
released hydrogen chloride gas he said 
struk said the monsanto spill did not leave any adverse health 
or environmental effects on the bloomfield community 
spokeswoman kathy meehan said conrail had no comment

rodney dangerfield made a reallife demand 
for respect monday in court receiving a trial date in a lawsuit 
accusing a hotel chain of using his querulous voice for commercials 
without permission 
us district judge dickran tevrizian scheduled a pretrial 
hearing sept 11 and trial oct 17 unless dangerfield and park inns 
inc of dallas can reach a settlement 
dangerfields lawyer john lavely said outside court the comic 
is adamant about pursuing the case in which an impersonator 
mimicked dangerfields voice on a radio commercial for the hotel 
chain 
rodney believes in this case said lavely the case poses 
the question of whether someone can do a satire of a famous person 
and get the benefit of something someone has spent their whole life 
developing 
in dangerfields case he said the entertainer has spent a 
lifetime developing a unique voice style and remarks such as i 
cant get no respect 
attorneys for park inns argue they have the right to satirize 
any famous person and note that their commercial which began 
running in the summer of 1988 and has since been discontinued 
contained a disclaimer saying that celebrity voices were 
impersonated 
dangerfield was not in court monday but he said in his 
complaint that the disclaimer was insufficient and contained an 
additional comment which suggested the disclaimer itself was a joke 
the complaint noted that the voice impersonator chimed in after 
the disclaimer with you mean this guy aint a real announcer he 
really had me fooled he sounded so good 
dangerfield and his paper clip productions claim damages in 
excess of 10000 on each of five causes of actions plus punitive 
damages 
dangerfield claims that park inns made substantial profits as a 
result of using his voice and deprived him of the chance to sell 
his name and likeness for such endorsements 
if there were 50 of these commercials on the air rodney 
wouldnt be able to get arrested said lavely

the justice department is recommending that 
president bush veto any legislation that would write into law the 
fairness doctrine and require that broadcasters air opposing views 
on controversial issues 
in a letter to rep john dingell dmich assistant attorney 
general thomas m boyd said the doctrine which the federal 
communications commission repealed in 1987 was outdated hindered 
free expression and unduly discriminated against broadcasters in 
favor of the print media 
dingell chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
introduced a bill this year that would make the doctrine law the 
bill was passed by the energy and commerce telecommunications and 
finance subcommittee last week and is to be considered by the full 
committee tuesday 
it is virtually identical to a measure passed by congress in 
1987 but vetoed by thenpresident reagan the present measure is 
expected to pass congress again 
although bush has not indicated his view on the fairness 
doctrine since he took office he said on the campaign trail last 
year he was against such a law 
boyd said the white house office of management and budget had 
advised him that enactment of a bill would not be in accord with 
the program of the president 
a copy of boyds letter to dingell dated last wednesday and 
obtained monday said the supreme court turned traditional first 
amendment analysis on its head in a landmark 1969 ruling on the 
fairness doctrine 
in that ruling the court held that the fairness doctrine did 
not violate the first amendment rights of broadcasters because the 
inherent scarcity of broadcast outlets required the government to 
regulate broadcasters for the public good 
boyd as did the fcc in its 1987 repeal said there no longer is 
a scarcity of outlets because of cable television and satellite 
broadcasting 
boyd also noted that the supreme court in 1974 overturned a 
florida law that required newspapers to provide space to political 
candidates who had been criticized by the newspaper 
the court at that time said the law was an unconstitutional 
intrusion on editors and rejected the argument that the actual 
scarcity of the print media justified a contentbased regulation 
boyd wrote 
boyd wrote that the purpose of the first amendment is to help 
assure that the people are adequately informed about public issues 
not to assure that they are adequately informed by one particular 
medium or group of media 
boyd noted that the fcc also said the doctrine inhibits 
broadcasters from presenting controversial issues and therefore 
the public is deprived of a marketplace of ideas unencumbered by 
the hand of government

the arab league rejected on monday the 
usendorsed israeli proposal for holding elections among 
palestinians on the west bank and in gaza and said it would send a 
delegation here next month to meet with secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
clovis maksoud the leagues representative here denounced the 
proposal by prime minister yitzhak shamir as a device to buy more 
time for israel and to diffuse the mounting pressure within the 
united states and throughout the world as well as to thwart the 
palestinian uprising 
maksoud at a news conference said shamir was seeking to find 
through elections a boneless or a toothless palestinian 
negotiator who ratifies his conquest 
he said the league delegation would include farouk kaddoumi who 
the palestine liberation organization calls its foreign minister 
and ministers from saudi arabia and algeria such a session would 
be bakers first meeting with a plo official 
shamir ignores the obvious assumption that the plo is the 
palestinian people and that any search outside its framework means 
that negotiations is not a serious or consequential pursuit but 
rather an exercise in futility maksoud said 
shamir outlined his proposal last week to president bush at the 
white house and gained the presidents endorsement shamir and bush 
made statements ruling out an independent palestinian state in the 
territories the arabs lost to israel in the 1967 sixday war 
the plan is totally unacceptable maksoud said the whole 
objective of the shamir plan is to derail the achievements of the 
intefadah the arabic word for uprising to undo what has been 
established namely the declaration of the palestinian state to 
undermine the plo to circumvent the international consensus 
maksoud met earlier in the day with paul hare the acting deputy 
assistant secretary of state for the near east and other state 
department officials 
shamirs plan has been rejected as well by the plo 
in tunis tunisia the plo rejected shamirs proposal the plo 
news agency wafa said in a dispatch attributed to an unnamed 
spokesman 
the idea of elections is totally unacceptable in the shadow of 
israeli occupation and this proposal is nothing but a maneuver 
aimed at undermining efforts undertaken by several world powers to 
achieve a just settlement in the middle east 
a state department spokesman richard boucher said yasser 
arafats organization should explore practical ways to advance 
the peace process 
he declined to say whether the united states had asked the plo 
to endorse shamirs proposal 
israel refuses to negotiate with the plo which it holds 
accountable for terrorism against the jewish state after arafat 
publicly renounced terrorism the united states dropped its ban on 
dealing with the plo and began talks in tunisia with plo officials 
shamirs propsal is to have palestinian leaders elected on the 
west bank and in gaza to negotiate with israel selfrule for the 
territories for five years to be followed by negotiations among 
israel the palestinians egypt and jordan on a final settlement 
maksoud praised bush for insisting last week on an end to what 
the president called israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza the arab league official said the statement was a positive 
one 
maksoud said the leagues delegation would visit washington in 
midmay presumably he meant after bakers return from moscow 
where he will hold talks may 1011 all 21 arab countries and the 
plo are members of the arab league

government troops killed 34 leftist guerrillas 
in two jungle clashes in a major counteroffensive in perus 
nineyear insurgency officials said monday 
prime minister armando villanueva said the fighting sunday 
marked the start of a drive against maoist guerrillas in the 
cocaineproducing jungle 
the state news agency andina said army soldiers battled a column 
of maoist shining path guerrillas for six hours near uchiza 245 
miles northeast of lima 
the fighting left 20 rebels dead and three soldiers wounded 
according to a military communique transmitted by andina 
the violence came two weeks after a column of rebels and drug 
traffickers overran the towns police post killing 10 policemen 
and three civilians 
uchiza is in the upper huallaga river valley a region known as 
perus cocaine cradle it has become a virtual nomans land 
overrun by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas who protect them 
in exchange for money to purchase arms 
fourteen more rebels were slain when navy marines patrolling the 
ucayali river 180 miles south of uchiza battled a guerrilla 
column for several hours andina said 
the government did not indicate any troop casualties in that 
clash

under intense criticism since the uchiza attack for failing to 
adequately defend the post and to send reinforcements 
critics have renewed charges that the government has mismanaged 
the antiinsurgency effort allowing rebel violence to spread 
the shining path insurgency has claimed more than 14000 lives 
including guerrillas soldiers police and innocent peasants 
the fighting began in 1980 in the central andes mountains and 
has branched out to coastal urban centers and the eastern jungle

the bush administration tried monday to 
squelch an effort by members of the house banking committee to 
weaken the administrations savings and loan reform plan by 
diluting a proposal to toughen capital standards 
a senior treasury department official briefing reporters on the 
condition of anonymity said the committees proposed capital rule 
has the cosmetic appearance of going in the right direction but 
would undermine the effectiveness of the capital discipline 
in reply a committee aide also speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the proposal is in some ways tougher although a 
greater number of solvent sampls would be able to meet it 
the aide said a bipartisan majority of the committee supports 
the compromise worked out by staff members in an allday session 
on saturday 
capital represents the interest of an institutions owners the 
more money the owners have at risk before federal deposit insurance 
kicks in the less likely the owners are to make speculative loans 
a central point in president bushs sampl package calls for 
increasing capital standards from 3 percent of assets currently to 
6 percent by june 1991 
the committee aide said the compromise supported by the federal 
deposit insurance corp and the federal home loan bank board would 
move up the deadline to june 1990 but it would more broadly define 
what counts as capital 
the treasury official expressed concern that the proposal would 
allow a return to the bad old days of phantom capital and 
capital pinned on lax regulatory accounting principles 
the part of it that is most disturbing to us is the definition 
of what constitutes capital the official said 
rep jim leach riowa in a luncheon speech to the independent 
bankers association of america said he opposed the committee 
compromise which he said was advocated by reps frank annunzio 
dill and doug barnard dga because it would have the effect 
of lowering the capital standard to 15 percent 
the irony is that the federal home loan bank boards current 
standards would be undercut dramatically he told reporters 
outside the meeting 
there is a great deal of pressure on the committee to be more 
flexible which means accommodating to the industry on capital 
standards he said my own view is that every time you weaken 
the standards you have the effect of weakening the commitment to 
never again 
at the treasury briefing the official said the department would 
support one element of the house proposal a laxer standard for 
residential mortgages requiring half as much capital backing as 
required for other types of loans 
i think the administration knows that theyre going to 
probably have to compromise a bit with congress my hope is that 
congress isnt too weak in what it tries to push down the 
administrations throat leach said 
the house banking subcommittee on financial institutions which 
includes 47 of the full committees 51 members is expected to take 
up capital rules at its second public session on the sampl bill 
scheduled tuesday 
in another development four consumer and community groups 
circulated a letter monday to committee members threatening to 
oppose the sampl legislation unless it contains amendments 
discouraging institutions from discrimination based on sex and race 
and encouraging lending for housing for low and moderateincome 
people 
we will oppose this legislation unless all these are 
responsibly addressed in the bill leaders of the four groups 
wrote remember the public is paying a price tag of more than 
200 billion and therefore must be assured that it will never 
again have to sign a blank check 
the groups are the consumers union consumer federation of 
america association of community organizations for reform now 
acorn and the center for community change

carmelite nuns living at the site of the nazi death 
camp at auschwitz in poland have erected crosses at their disputed 
convent the head of frances jewish community disclosed monday 
in a letter of protest to french roman catholic cardinal albert 
decourtray theo klein said three crosses have been erected at the 
convent of carmelite nuns a building used by the nazis as a 
warehouse during world war ii to store the deadly zyklon b gas 
klein president of the representative council of french jewish 
organizations was along with decourtray among the signatories to 
a 1987 agreement for the convent to moved from the site by february 
1989 
the letter dated april 6 was made public in washington by the 
world jewish congress 
a 23foot cross has gone up on top of the largest jewish 
graveyard in the world elan steinberg executive director of the 
congress said in washington this will further harm already 
strained relations with the vatican 
the erection of the crosses marks the latest episode in a bitter 
clash between jewish leaders and the vatican over the presence of a 
dozen nuns on the site that has become a memorial to the 6 million 
jews murdered by the nazis 
in paris klein told the associated press the letter was the 
most recent in a series of exchanges over the crosses 
theres one on the building another wooden one on a place 
called the way of the cross and a third smaller one on the gate 
next to three stars of david klein said in a telephone interview 
he said the erection of crosses contradicted assurances he 
received earlier this year from polish catholic authorities that 
the nuns had agreed to move from the convent founded in 1984 as a 
center for prayer and meditation 
people returning from recent visits to auschwitz were very 
shocked to see that the very nuns who were supposedly getting ready 
to move from the convent were in fact getting ready to settle in 
permanently klein said 
under the 1987 agreement signed by representatives of the

a christian scientist couple whose 
7yearold daughter died of diabetes went on trial on murder 
charges monday in a test of a state law legally absolving parents 
when religious beliefs prohibit medical care 
nine potential jurors were excused in the trial of william 
hermanson 42 and his 38yearold wife christine on charges of 
thirddegree murder and child abuse in the death 2 years ago of 
their daughter amy 
if convicted the hermansons face three to seven years in prison 
state circuit judge steven dakan took under consideration a 
defense motion to move the trial out of sarasota county on grounds 
of excessive pretrial publicity he said he wanted to see if a fair 
and impartial panel could be chosen in the hermansons hometown 
before ruling 
jurors will be asked to weigh legal and moral questions about 
the balance between religious freedom and childrens rights 
the case challenges a 1975 law absolving parents of abuse or 
neglect charges when they deny their children medical care because 
of deep religious beliefs 
defense attorney thomas dart said the law excludes people like 
the hermansons from criminal charges but prosecutors say the law 
should not shield parents who let their children die 
the hermansons refused a plea bargain under which they would 
have served 15 years probation in return for pleading guilty or no 
contest for a chance to have their case heard by jury 
hermanson worked as a bank vice president and his wife ran a 
fine arts academy they have another child eric 11 
a cornerstone of christian science doctrine is the reliance on 
prayer instead of medicine to care for the ill in difficult cases 
they may seek help from practitioners senior church members 
with expertise in spiritual healing however individuals may seek 
medical assistance without fear of church sanctions 
amy became ill in september 1986 and the hermansons called on 
two such practitioners authorities said she died sept 30 after 
the girl died a medical examiner concluded that medical treatment 
probably could have saved her

the government asked the judge in oliver 
norths trial monday to deny norths request for surveillance 
records on foreigners involved in negotiations to free us 
hostages 
the justice department said norths attempt near the end of the 
trial to subpoena the records was calculated to graymail the 
united states by threatening disclosure of secrets to force 
dismissal of the charges 
this is a lastditch effort to use classified information as a 
weapon rather than as proof said the department which also 
filed under court seal an affidavit by mary c lawton counsel for 
intelligence policy 
the information sought receives the highest protection under 
the foreign intelligence surveillance act and the harm to national 
security of disclosure of this information would be enormous the 
department said in papers filed by assistant attorney general 
edward sg dennis jr head of the criminal division 
as an alternative to furnishing records of the surveillances 
the department proposed a stipulation of facts about eavesdropping 
by intelligence agencies approved by the secret foreign 
intelligence surveillance court 
the stipulation document included an indication that iranian 
arms dealer manucher ghorbanifar was among those who were the 
object of surveillances conducted in washington by unnamed 
intelligence agencies 
the justice department said surveillances were conducted between 
oct 1985 and september 1986 of several foreigners none named 
at the request of thencia director william casey 
included were several foreign nationals who purported to be 
or have direct access to representatives of the government of 
iran according to the proposed stipulation 
the surveillances related to negotiations concerning the 
release of american hostages in lebanon the document said 
on oct 7 1985 the department with the authorization of 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii sought court approval for 
surveillance of two foreigners the document said 
the next day north met in washington with ghorbanifar as well 
as israeli arms dealers al schwimmer and yaacov nimrodi according 
to the report of the presidential commission headed by former sen 
john tower 
another surveillance of one of the same two individuals was 
approved on april 2 1986 
on the next day north and cia consultant george cave met in 
washington with ghorbanifar according to the tower report 
the meetings which continued april 4 1986 involved 
discussions about the forthcoming mission to tehran led by north 
and former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
the justice department document also detailed another round of 
surveillances approved by meese in september 1986 
these surveillances coincided with meetings north and cave had 
in washington with representatives of an iranian group that 
reportedly included the son of hashemi rafsanjani the speaker of 
irans parliament

oliver north seemingly struggling to keep his 
temper on monday defended his stewardship of an irancontra cash 
fund and insisted the money he paid for a used car came instead 
from a 15000 family cache in a metal box bolted to a closet floor 
in norths third day as a witness a contentious one prosecutor 
john keker tried to show that north dipped into the fund arranged 
for 200000 in free life insurance allowed his colleagues to make 
huge profits on irancontra dealings and accepted a free security 
fence 
at the start of cross examination at his trial north said he 
kept track in a spiralbound notebook of every penny he disbursed 
from the irancontra fund which totaled between 240000 and 
300000 
the ledger is still around asked prosecutor john keker 
it was destroyed north said 
do you know who destroyed it 
yes he said i did 
later keker asked whether north was nervous about destroying 
the ledger north said not because i couldnt believe i could 
ever be accused of doing anything dishonest with that money 
in quick succession keker touched on other charges and north 
fired back answers 
on the 13800 security system installed at his home paid for 
by codefendant richard secord to this day i dont know exactly 
who or how that security system was paid for i did intend to 
pay for it 
on a 200000 insurance fund set up for norths family by 
irancontra moneyman albert hakim asked if he knew hakim is 
charged with bribing him north said he is not guilty of it 
because mr hakim did not try to bribe me 
on profits by secord and hakim keker asked if he knew whether 
secord made a few hundred thousands or millions and north said 
he didnt know but he added i believed then and i believe 
today general secord was taking fair and just compensation for the 
many hours he was putting in 
keker asked north if in fact everybody was taking a piece 
of the money involved 
no that is not so said north you are talking to one who 
didnt 
north said he was angry at the government having been fairly 
well trashed at the time he wrote two backdated letters in 
december 1986 to make it appear he was going to pay for the 
security system it has to be one of the dumbest things i have 
done in my life he said 
he wrote the letters after he was fired from his national 
security council job and threatened with becoming the target of a 
criminal investigation 
meanwhile the government asked the judge in norths trial to 
deny his request for surveillance records on foreigners involved in 
negotiations to free us hostages 
the justice department said norths attempt near the end of the 
trial to subpoena the records was calculated to graymail the 
united states by threatening disclosure of secrets to force 
dismissal of the charges 
earlier monday north testified that former president reagan and 
his attorney general edwin meese iii concealed us involvement 
in a november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles from israel to iran 
in a meeting on nov 12 1986 reagan clearly had made a 
decision not to disclose the shipment north said 
the president told a news conference on nov 19 a week after 
that meeting that the government had not been involved with other 
nations in shipping weapons to iran and that the united states had 
shipped none before he signed a january 1986 authorizing document 
immediately afterward the white house put out a statement in which 
reagan said a third country had been involved 
north testified that he assumed reagan had known of the 
diversion of iran arms sale funds to the contras a contention 
reagan has denied 
north said he shredded the financial accounting notebook page 
by page on orders of the late cia director william casey because 
it had names and addresses of people whose lives would be in danger 
were they to become public the shredding took place he said in 
late 1986 when the irancontra affair began to unravel 
keker intimated that the 8038 paid for norths car a 
chevrolet suburban with 51000 miles came from the 
northadministered fund established to pay the expenses of 
nicaraguan rebel leaders when they were in this country and to 
support the iran initiative 
there had been previous testimony that rebel leader adolfo 
calero put 90000 to 100000 in travelers checks into the fund 
and retired air force maj gen secord put in 150000 to 200000 
cash 
do you remember being tempted to use the travelers checks for 
your personal use 
never once north shot back 
north is accused of converting 4300 of those checks to his own 
use although not in connection with the used car 
he said that in 1985 he earned about 50000 from the marine 
corps where he was a lieutenant colonel and also had some income 
from investments and dividends 
we had a yard sale or two and i think my wife sold some 
puppies he said we always lived on our budget we always were 
very frugal 
asked where the money came from to buy the car north said it 
came out of the family fund which he started in 1967 with an 
insurance settlement from an automobile accident he said when he 
came home at night he would throw his change into that box 
the change out of your pocket grew to 15000 in your house 
keker asked north said yes 
in november 1986 two days after he said he had told meese 
details of the hawk missile shipment he heard meese say at a news 
conference that the israelis had made the 1985 shipment without 
us involvement 
meese gave a whole series of answers that were 
inconsistent with what i had told himsaid north it made me 
wonder whether i had talked to the attorney general 
one of the 12 felony charges against north is that he lied to 
meese during their meeting 
he is also charged with lying to congress destroying or 
falsifying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity

the navy has performed a medical statistical 
study that suggests sailors serving aboard nuclearmissile 
submarines are more likely to develop cancer than their civilian 
counterparts a trade publication said monday 
navy news and undersea technology the publication said the 
study had been criticized by one outside researcher as utilizing 
procedures that were bound to be biased in the navys favor 
nonetheless the study suggests a 37 percent difference between 
cancer rates for the general population and sailors aboard nuclear 
missile submarines 
the publication said the statistical tabulation reported an 
observed rate of cancer cases among missile submarine personnel 
of 54 compared to an expected rate for the general population 
of 394 
the navy declined immediate comment on monday saying it hoped 
to release a statement on the matter tuesday

americas newspapers and radio and television 
stations discriminate against women in pay promotions and news 
coverage a study released monday at a conference on women men 
and media said 
media coverage of and by women is inexcusably poor junior 
bridge a washington media consultant told delegates to the 
conference sponsored by the gannett foundation 
the study financed largely by the foundation showed that 6 
percent of news media jobs as publisher president or vice 
president are held by women the share was 6 percent for 
newspapers 3 percent for television and 8 percent for radio 
it said women in media earn less than twothirds as much as men 
64 cents for every dollar paid to a male employe comparing women 
and men the study said women average 9074 less per year in 
television 7793 less on newspapers and 3323 less in radio 
jean gaddy wilson of the university of missouri who conducted 
the study of hiring and promotion said the survey covered 1599 
daily newspapers l219 television stations and 1091 radio 
stations 
john seigenthaler editor of the nashville tennesseean and 
president of the american society of newspaper editors asked to 
comment on the report said its a cliche to talk about a 
comfort level and that good old boys are more comfortable with 
good old boys than they are with anybody else but i am afraid that 
those numbers document that 
until a majority of the papers begin to insist that something 
be done about the comfort level of good old boys like me we are 
not going to make the sort of progress that justice requires he 
said 
officials of the radio and television news directors association 
were away from their office and not available to comment an 
employe in the office said 
the study of television and newspaper coverage was conducted by 
ms bridge and kathy bonk codirector of communications 
consortium a selfdescribed public interest media center based in 
washington 
it showed that on the three major nightly television news 
programs during february 158 percent of the stories were reported 
by women 
in 10 newspapers 27 percent of the bylines on the front pages 
in march were female 11 percent of the people quoted were female 
and 24 percent of the photographs included women unlike the men 
the women usually appeared in group shots with family members 
by averaging where the papers ranked in the three categories 
the study rated usa today gannetts washingtonbased national 
newspaper as best with 41 percent of its frontpage bylines 
female and with women in 41 percent of its frontpage pictures 
there were references to women by name in 21 percent of the papers 
frontpage stories 
the new york times rated worst with women getting 16 per 
cent of frontpage bylines and appearing in 16 percent of 
frontpage photographs women were referred to by name in 5 percent 
of frontpage stories 
the houston chronicle and atlanta constitution tied for second 
followed in order by the seattle times washington post los 
angeles times miami herald st louis postdispatch and chicago 
tribune 
the study said 25 percent of newspaper news staffs are women 
while 75 percent of the business office staffs are women in 
television women account for 32 percent of the news staffs and 77 
percent of the business staffs in radio the figures are 34 
percent for news and 83 percent for television 
the study of television networks showed that women reported 222 
percent of the stories on the cbs evening news in february 144 
percent of the stories on the corresponding nbc program and 105 
percent on abc 
it also said that 137 percent of the abc stories 102 percent 
of the cbs stories and 89 percent of the nbc stories focused on 
women as their subject 
diana meehan director of the institute for the study of men and 
women at the university of southern california said she is making 
a study of women executives in television and has found that the 30 
highestranking ones all were the firstborn or only child in their 
families 
in addition she said they are all from families that had 
some wordly success all broke into the business as writers and 
all attended universities in the midwest or in new york not ivy 
league schools by comparison she said top male executives often

a womans right to become pregnant in a 
testtube baby procedure should outweigh her estranged husbands 
decision not to become a father the womans attorney said monday 
mary sue davis 28 and junior lewis davis 30 are getting a 
divorce and are at odds over what to do with seven of her eggs that 
are fertilized with his sperm and kept in frozen storage 
davis who filed a divorce petition in february referred to the 
embryos as property jointly owned and said he doesnt want mrs 
davis to become pregnant with them 
mrs davis considers the matter a custody battle and has said 
the embryos are life that should be taken to term by being 
implanted inside her 
the blount county tenn couple have participated in an 
invitro fertilization program in knoxville for six years in an 
effort to become parents 
the two were married in 1979 mrs davis said she had had five 
tubal pregnancies resulting in the rupture of one fallopian tube 
and surgery to tie the other by the time she and her husband began 
the invitro fertilization program 
mrs davis attorney jg christenberry said in an interview 
that because a woman can do more for the eggs produce a child 
than a man can her wants should outweigh his when issues such as 
this arise 
christenberry said he hoped the blount county circuit court case 
could be heard by july in a twopage court response filed last 
week he said mrs davis maintains she is the proper party to be 
awarded the custody of her embryos for her exclusive use 
the davises acknowledge that the case is an unusual one 
incorporating medical technology personal rights and ethics and 
that there apparently are no previous court cases like it 
many invitro fertilization clinics require couples to sign 
written agreements regarding the fate of their frozen embryos in 
the event of the man and womans death or divorce however medical 
officials have conceded its hard to draft consent forms that 
include every possible scenario for embryos 
the davises said they were not asked to sign such a paper 
dr i ray king founder of the clinic in knoxville has said 
that was an oversight but he added that any such agreement 
probably could be contested legally later by a husband or wife who 
changed his or her mind 
king has agreed to continue maintaining the seven frozen viable 
embryos

the odds that congress will approve oil 
drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge dropped monday as a 
congressman whose subcommittee oversees the alaska pipeline blasted 
the industrys ability to clean up after itself 
it is clear that what happened in prince william sound was not 
a simple accident said rep george miller following a threeday 
visit to alaska to see the effects of the exxon valdez oil tanker 
accident 
rather it was the tragic result of a systematic assault by 
the oil industry that rendered ineffective the entire system of 
regulatory safeguards the california democrat told a press 
conference 
he said it would irresponsible to allow lease sales in the 
refuge after seeing the ineffectiveness of exxon in dealing with 
its 10 million gallon spill into one of the nations most 
environmentally delicate areas 
rep morris udall dariz chairman of the interior committee 
agreed that legislation to allow oil lease sales in the refuge is 
dead this year but he would not rule out its passage next year 
reacting to the nations largest oil spill legislators began 
expressing doubts about the anwr legislation last week and as the 
oil continues to spread are growing increasingly disappointed with 
exxon and others who are connected with cleanup efforts 
sen bennett johnston dla whose committee on energy and 
natural resources approved the anwr bill last month said after the 
spill that he could not tell right away what the impact would be 
but a few days later he said he would not push the bill for a full 
senate vote until safety systems were in place 
rep bill richards dnm supported anwr drilling before the 
oil spill but said he has changed his mind 
the house subcommittee on national parks and public lands 
announced a hearing thursday to find out what the national park 
service is doing to clean up oil that reached the kenai fjords 
national park on monday and was on its way to the katmai and lake 
clark national parks 
miller said the spill requires us to completely reevaluate 
our the system of delivery 
he oil tanker ran aground march 24 and the spill is still not 
under control 
miller said the industry had promised that it could handle any 
problems connected with oil shipping but over the years stripped 
away the safeguards for costcutting purposes 
he said an authority that could command cleanup after an 
accident like that last month should be established 
we have to separate those that are looking out for the public 
and those looking out for the industry he said i want a 
system by which the first thing the industry does is clean up the 
oil in the water and not call their lawyers 
at least one congressional subcommittee is planning to look into 
the increases in retail gasoline prices that have occurred since 
the grounding of the oil tanker 
the energy committees energy regulation and conservation 
subcommittee chaired by sen howard metzenbaum dohio has 
planned a hearing for next monday said the panels counsel joel 
saltzman the lawmaker has invited industry and government 
officials along with consumer advocates to testify 
since the accident oil industry analysts have noted increases 
of about a dime per gallon in the prices motorists pay for gasoline 
they have attributed the higher prices not only to the spill and 
the temporary shutdown of the pipeline but to tight international 
supplies an unusually high proportion of us refineries 
undergoing maintenance the costs of complying with nw federal 
restrictions on fuel ingredients and the usual runup in prices 
with the approach of the summer driving season

church leader ilya ii to ask demonstrators to go home at 315 am 
sunday 
he came and asked and begged patiashvili said 
he said armored personnel carriers were moved up in a show of 
force unfortunately this did not cool them down but had the 
opposite effect a commission is investigating he said 
as many as 1000 people massed at the university monday said 
zurab zhankarashvili a member of the helsinki watch group who was 
at the gathering 
the military stood there with their tanks and frightened the 
people off they shot in the air 
sergei dandurov a nationalist activist who attended the 
meeting said troops jumped from armored personnel carriers and 
began firing in the air the crowd scattered with some people 
fleeing into a university building he said 
zhankarashvili said soldiers beat two students the troops 
prevented further demonstrations 
as soon as a group gathers they come and break it up 
zhankarashvili said 
shevardnadze 61 arrived in tbilisi over the weekend residents

more than two weeks of efforts to clean up 
the nations largest oil spill has created another headache for 
those in charge a mountain of oily garbage 
the cleanup has started to accumulate uncounted amounts of 
absorbant pads oiled clothing trash bags and even a trailer full 
of dead birds and otters 
were still in the process of developing the numbers said 
bob lewis a solid waste expert with exxon environmental group 
much of the waste is in the form of pads used to absorb oil in 
the water and along the shoreline the pads similar in material to 
disposable diapers are being collected at cleanup sites in prince 
william sound 
when the cleanup of the sounds shoreline gets under way it will 
produce tons of the oily plastic and paper authorities said 
officials are also faced with the disposal of hundreds of birds 
and otters collected in the sound as of monday there were a 
reported 835 dead birds and 134 dead sea otters 
many of the bodies are stored in a refrigerated truck parked 
behind the valdez courthouse the truck is not yet filled but more 
animals are being brought in every day 
the present plan is to burn the waste in portable incinerators 
bill lamoreaux the states onscene coordinator said some 
experimental burning has already taken place 
lewis said the incinerators which use heating oil to fire the 
garbage may be placed in strategic locations around the sound 
we have small ones the size of a truck that are fairly 
portable he said

last weeks agreement in principle on 
agricultural trade included language acceptable to the european 
economic community and did not represent a cavein by us 
negotiators agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said monday 
the eec had balked at the earlier us insistence that all 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the long 
haul the agreement reached in geneva last week by more than 100 
countries calls for a substantial progressive reduction in such 
subsidies 
yeutter in an interview with a group of reporters said the 
europeans had objected to earlier language calling for the 
elimination of the subsidies and later to a modified 
ratcheting down of them 
asked if the final language represented backtracking on the part 
of the united states in its quest to do away eventually with 
tradedistorting subsidies and other practices yeutter replied 
i dont consider it backtracking at all 
indeed he said there is no practical difference between 
elimination or racheting or the accepted substantial 
progressive reduction of subsidies regardless of what some 
european leaders may feel 
they may have their own reasons for articulating the outcome 
of the meeting as they have yeutter said obviously everyone 
will go home and to some degree at least articulate their own 
interpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs 
the accord provides a framework for further discussions under 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade a fouryear effort 
called the uruguay round of talks to liberalize global trade the 
current gatt round will conclude at the end of 1990 
as part of the geneva agreement participants agreed to an 
overall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990 
yeutter said the us goal is to gain longterm accord on the 
future of agricultural trade and that the shortterm agreement 
reached in geneva while acceptable was no big challenge for us 
negotiators 
some american farm leaders including dean kleckner of the 
american farm bureau federation had urged congress to proceed 
writing a new general farm bill on an assumption that little 
progress could be expected under the gatt talks 
yeutter said he had no objection to congress proceeding with a 
new farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year 
and yeutter denied that he had favored going slow on legislation 
until it was clearer how the gatt talks would shape up 
somehow that got misinterpreted because thats not really 
what i meant at all yeutter said 
assuming that gatt negotiations are a success the 1990 farm 
legislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991 he 
said but i never meant to indicate that we shouldnt have 
fullscale farm legislation in 1990 
on the matter of us export subsidies used in the export 
enhancement program or eep yeutter said it was our view that we 
are not constrained on eep expenditures 
yeutter said further that he still favors congress removing the 
lid on eep spending so that the united states can match the 
unrestrained export subsidies of the europeans the program he 
said was a major factor in reaching an aggreement in geneva last 
week

yang jings hands quivered as the dissident tried 
monday to readjust to the strangeness of just sitting in a coffee 
shop and talking he was released from prison three days ago 
im not used to it he said with a shy smile as he 
chainsmoked 
yang 42 was arrested april 8 1981 at a friends house 
discussing ways to stop officials from shutting down the april 
fifth forum one of the most widely known underground journals of 
the 197879 democracy wall movement 
he was accused of spying and sentenced to eight years at 
beijings no 1 prison where for 10 months he was confined to a 
6footsquare cell 
on saturday eight years later to the day he returned to his 
family including an 8yearold son born after his arrest his wife 
had told the youngster his father was on a research project at the 
south pole 
it is a fractured family yang said his father died in february 
and one brother has not forgiven him for being imprisoned and 
refused to come to his welcomehome dinner 
yang in an interview with the associated press said his goal 
now is to rebuild his life without politics or controversy 
although he has completed his prison term his political rights 
remain suspended for three years 
i will try to live quietly maybe painting he said i 
want to take care of my health 
yang said his muscles have wasted away and he lost at least 10 
pounds while in jail his tan slacks and blue workers jacket 
saved from before he went to prison were loose on his slight frame 
yang left behind in the no 1 prison another editor of the april 
fifth forum xu wenli who was arrested two days after yang and 
sentenced to 15 years xu has been kept apart from most of the 
other prisoners and barred from having visitors since 1985 
a third editor of the monthly journal liu qing is scheduled to 
be released from a jail in northcentral china in november 
the group began publishing the april fifth forum in their homes 
during the democracy wall movement named after a wall in beijing 
where hundreds of people put up posters in 197879 calling for 
reform of the communist partys authoritarian rule 
senior leader deng xiaoping then newly established in power and 
struggling with conservatives initially gave the activists 
approval but after consolidating power he halted the poster 
activity and police began arresting leaders of the movement 
i think the country needed democracy wall yang said i 
think the magazine really made a contribution although we were 
arrested step by step many of our demands were later adopted by 
the authorities 
for example we suggested people have the right to information 
about government and the economy the right of supervision to some 
degree this is being carried out of course it is lacking in many 
ways but things are going in the right direction 
more than two dozen democracy wall activists remain in prison 
with several due for release in the next two years 
more than 100 intellectuals in china 24000 people in hong kong 
and hundreds of chinese in taiwan and the united states have signed 
petitions in the past two months calling for an amnesty for all 
political prisoners 
in 1982 yang was caught slipping a note to a fellow prisoner 
and was placed for 10 months in a special cell called the little 
number because it was only six feet wide and six feet long with 
the light always on yang said 
he said he kept track of the passage of days because guards gave 
him the official party newspaper the peoples daily each day to 
study 
beginning in 1987 treatment improved he said life settled into 
a quiet routine in which he worked in a plastic sandals factory and 
tried to spend little time thinking about freedom 
he was allowed to leave the prison twice this year to see his 
dying father in the hospital and to attend the funeral his wife 
could visit him occasionally 
since his release yang spent most of the time in the familys 
tworoom home on a narrow alley in western beijing but his younger 
brother gave him tickets to a movie 
it turned out to be about spies and jail and how to escape 
from jail yang said with a wide grin

syrian and druse gunners fired rocket 
barrages onto christian beaches monday in what police called a 
rehearsal for shelling french aid ships expected to arrive this 
week 
france is sending two ships loaded with fuel medical and food 
supplies to help ease shortages caused by a month of the worst 
sectarian fighting since 1985 
newspapers say the ships are due wednesday and moslems say the 
former colonial power is biased toward the christians 
france says the aid is destined for all lebanese a french envoy 
to lebanon was quoted as saying syrian gunfire against the aid 
ships would be an act of war against france against humanity 
against an emergency humanitarian action 
if they fire it is clear that they want to destroy lebanon 
jeanfrancois deniau home from a twoday mission to lebanon was 
quoted as saying in the french daily newspaper la nouvelle 
republique du centreouest of tours he added he did not believe 
that would happen 
christian army units led by gen michel aoun responded to 
mondays rocket fire with 155mm howitzers shelling the ein 
mreisseh and wadi abu jamil neighborhoods of moslem west beirut 
police reported two people killed and 15 wounded in west beirut 
they said the fire was directed at syrian rocket launchers in the 
two districts and at the murr tower a unfinished 40story building 
the syrians use as a sniping and observation post 
mondays exchanges violated a ceasefire proclaimed by the arab 
league which began at midnight wednesday 
a police spokesman said a shell hit a turkish cargo ship 
carrying 2200 tons of flour sunday night off jounieh a christian 
port north of beirut killing one of its 12 crew members and 
damaging the vessel 
west beirut press reports said an army gunboat fired on the 
mololi because it was taking flour to sidon a moslemcontrolled 
port in the south the ship left lebanese waters after the attack 
for famagusta cyprus said the police spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing regulations 
artillery duels betweeen aouns 20000 christian troopers and an 
alliance of syrian soldiers and druse militiamen began march 8 two 
days after aouns forces blockaded illegal ports run by militias 
according to police figures 180 people have been killed and 619 
wounded nearly all of them civilians 
mitri nammar head of the beirut electricity authority said the 
main city power plant at zouk a suburb of christian east beirut 
was out of fuel and unless something is urgently done the 
onehour daily supply of electricity to the capital and its 
environs will stop 
syrian and druse gunners regularly fire at the zouk beach 
preventing fuel tankers from docking there 
french ambassador paul blanc visited moslem west beirut and met 
with salah staitieh of the moslem governments foreign ministry a 
crisis that began in september has created competing christian and 
moslem governments led by aoun and premier salim hoss a sunni 
moslem and divided the army 
staitieh said he told blanc the moslem cabinet is moving 
toward rejecting the french relief aid in this case let france 
give all these supplies to the other party with whom it 
sympathizes 
maj gen sami khatibs 22000man moslem army suggested in a 
statement that the french vessels dock in the northern port of 
tripoli to ensure the safety of the two ships and their crew 
moslems control tripoli 
police say bombardment of the beaches near the zouk power plant 
and the christian port of jounieh north of beirut has been a 
rehearsal for arrival of the ships sent by france from which 
lebanon became independent in 1943 
france has supported the aouns demand for withdrawal of the 
40000 syrian soldiers stationed in lebanon under a peacekeeping 
mandate issued by the arab league in 1976 the year after the 
lebanese civil war began

william j bennett unveiled a bush 
administration plan on monday to spend at least 70 million 
fighting drugs in the nations capital and said local officials 
have allowed the problem to grow glaringly out of control 
bennett director of the national drug control policy office 
said the plain fact is that for too long and in too many 
respects the dc government has failed to serve its citizens 
the plans include construction of new pretrial detention and 
prison facilities expansion of a local law enforcement task force 
an effort to rid public housing of drug users and dealers 
expansion of drugtreatment facilities and an increase in 
jobtraining programs 
bennett spoke at a news conference with attorney general dick 
thornburgh and housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
washington was the nations murder capital last year with 372 
slayings most of them drugrelated already this year there have 
been 135 homicides compared with 87 at this time last year 
bennett said drugs and demand for drugs sorely test the 
responsive abilities of dozens of american cities but here where 
the problem is so glaring so out of control serious questions 
of local politics and governance can no longer be avoided or 
excused they must be answered 
the local government has not acted in as responsible way as 
they should have he said he said the federal effort should not 
be construed as an attack on home rule for the district or an 
attempt to get the city government off the hook 
mayor marion barry jr said he welcomed the federal governments 
help the idea of washington being a model in programs to fight 
drugs we look forward to a long working relationship the 
mayor added he left a news conference before reporters could ask 
if he had been stung by bennetts remarks 
bennett estimated that the plans approved by president bush 
will cost 70 million to 80 million although he cautioned that 
there was no firm price tag the money will come from 
redeployment of existing resources said bennett who did not 
indicate the current use for the money 
on capitol hill sen joseph r biden ddel applauded the 
plan but said the bush administration must be specific on how it 
will be paid for 
theres no way at all that this can be done without 
appropriating more money or hurting existing programs biden said 
and he said that if the program were to rid the capital of the 
scourge of drugs there would be no way other cities with serious 
narcotics problems could be denied similar efforts 
washington is a special place a special response is required 
but if we prove the government can solve the drug problem and then 
allow the other areas of the country to go begging we will have 
been somewhat hypocritical biden said 
another lawmaker sen john warner rva also praised the 
program but said it would be counterproductive if it merely drove 
the narcotics traffic out of the capital and into the adjoining 
maryland and virginia suburbs and then provided no funds for extra 
police efforts in those areas 
bennett aide don hamilton said later that the effort will cost 
far more than what bennett had mentioned that figure doesnt 
include the 50 million the dc government has already had for 
some time to build a pretrial detention facility and doesnt 
include guard costs some of the salaries of people who will be 
dedicated to this said hamilton 
the federal effort includes housing 250 city inmates at federal 
prisons construction of a 500bed pretrial detention facility to 
be built within one year and contruction of a new 700bed federal 
prison for the washingtonbaltimore area within two years 
bennett criticized the district government for failing to 
construct the detention facility in the three years since congress 
appropriated the money for it saying that due to the lack of 
space thousands of people arrested for drug and other serious 
crimes in this city regularly go free 
meanwhile a washingtonarea drug task force will get an 
additional 57 federal state and local investigators under the 
plan including 25 fbi agents and 11 drug enforcement 
administration agents 
five defense department intelligence analysts will be assigned 
to the task force which will concentrate on identifying crack 
cocaine distributors in the washington area and will establish a 
unified intelligence system to support all law enforcement 
operations in the metropolitan area 
kemp outlined plans by the housing and urban development 
department to ease regulations on the eviction of drug offenders 
from federally funded housing projects 
bennett saying the city lacked a coordinated effort in its 
drugfighting programs said the district officials should not 
be dragging their feet on issues secretary kemp is talking 
about 
kemp asked dc police chief maurice turner to arrange for 
issuing photo identification cards for public housing tenants 
installing security devices and control of entrances and exits to 
such housing projects 
kemp a former professional football quarterback also called 
for creation of baseball and football teams in every public 
housing project in america saying he got the idea from a 
television broadcast on a harlem couple who spurred neighbors to 
create the areas first little league team in decades 
the department of health and human services is to establish 
three model outpatient drug clinics in the city to provide at least 
300 new treatment slots by 1990 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush 
was letting bennett be the lead spokesman on the plan and that bush 
wont comment on individual measures 
its bill bennetts plan fitzwater said the president 
has reviewed it and approved it in a general sense while 
director bennetts proposals may not be popular they do represent 
a coming to terms with the hard issues 
fitzwater said the initiatives will be subject to negotiation 
and discussion with leaders of the district and of suburban 
jurisdictions saying that the federal government cannot impose 
such a plan on the local governments

human rights activist andrei d sakharov spurned 
in his first try won easy nomination monday to a list of 28 
candidates from the academy of sciences who will run for seats in 
the new soviet parliament 
historian roy medvedev chronicler of dictator josef stalins 
purges emerged a winner in sundays runoff election for seats in 
the congress of peoples deputies 
medvedev whose critical studies of stalinism were not published 
in the soviet union until recently won 523 percent of the vote in 
his race in moscows voroshilov district against ksenya razumova 
head of an atomic research laboratory district election officials 
said 
sakharov was among 28 members nominated to run for 12 unfilled 
seats out of 20 allocated to the academy of sciences in the new 
congress the official tass news agency reported 
sakharov a nuclear physicist who helped develop the soviets 
atomic bomb won the 1975 nobel peace prize for his human rights 
activities 
he was exiled to the closed city of gorky in 1980 for his 
criticism of soviet policies but was allowed to return to moscow in 
december 1986 and has resumed speaking out on political issues 
other prominent scientists named in mondays balloting for the 
academy seats included georgy arbatov director of the usa and 
canada institute roald sagdeev a space researcher and economist 
nikolai shmelev 
the final list of 28 was chosen from 168 contenders by 37 
members of the academys presidium reporters who attended the 
session said sakharov got 34 votes sagdeev 37 arbatov 36 and 
shmelev 34 
during the first round of balloting on march 21 the academys 
general assembly elected just eight of 23 scientists running for 
the 20 seats allocated to it under new soviet legislation tass 
said 
a final vote to elect the academys remaining deputies to the 
congress will be taken during a general assembly meeting april 
1921 according to tass 
of the 2250 seats in the congress 750 were assigned to the 
communist party and its affiliates and to social and professional 
organizations like the academy of sciences 
sakharov previously was proposed as a candidate but an academy 
electoral commission removed him and other reformers from the final 
list in favor of oldguard academy managers sakharov supporters 
successfully blocked about twothirds of that slate and forced the 
second election 
medvedev unlike sakharov ran in one of the 64 constituencies 
that held runoff elections sunday for seats that were not filled 
during the march 26 nationwide balloting that saw many top 
communist party and government officials rejected by voters 
while sakharov faces yet another vote the selection of medvedev 
is final 
the tass report on the runoff voting said these 
constituencies had fielded three or more candidates who failed to 
win the required 50 percent of the vote during the initial round of 
voting 
this time the top two contestants appeared on the ballot and 
one needed only a simple majority to be elected 
another winner in moscows runoff elections was writer yuri 
chernichenko a supporter of former moscow party boss boris n 
yeltsins successful maverick candidacy 
pamphlets calling for an election boycott appeared in three 
moscow disticts the communist party newspaper pravda said it said 
the pamphlets apparently were distributed in the hope that fewer 
than 50 percent of voters would turn out forcing yet another 
election 
tass said there were victors in all of the districts and the 
voter turnout was 671 percent 
in leningrad where communist party chief yuri solovyev and 
other top officials lost their election bids lawyer anatoly 
sobchak won one of six district runoff elections tass said 
sobchak ran on a platform similar to yeltsins an end to special 
privileges for government and party leaders direct elections of 
party officials and the rule of law 
lithuanias independent political group sajudis expanded its 
march 26 sweep to gain 36 of the baltic republics 42 seats in the 
new parliament only three sajudisbacked candidates lost said 
spokesman alvydas juozaidis 
kjastutis zaljaskas the communist party chief of vilnius who is 
also an ethnic lithuanian won the runoff against a sajudisbacked 
candidate tass reported 
the news agency said new elections will be held may 14 in 199 
districts nationwide where only one or two candidates ran and 
failed to receive the required 50 percent

as a result of the operation 
he said the dessalines were ordered to report to army 
headquarters on tuesday for instructions 
avril said the leopards battalion the other unit that rebelled 
against the government last week was no longer in revolt and the 
army command was negotiating with them over their grievances 
we wont say all the problems are resolved but i think it is 
coming the president said adding that 12 of the 414 soldiers 
attached to the commando unit had failed to return to base 
the leopards had protested the governments dismissals of 
several army officers in a crackdown on drugrunning and corruption 
in the army their former commander lt col himmler rebu was 
identified as one of the four ringleaders of the coup attempt 
avril repeated the governments accusation that the uprising was 
led by haitian exiles linked to the ousted regime of jean claude 
duvalier who fled into exile in france in february 1986

the 107item government admission of facts

administration officials as incomplete and therefore distorted 
one official said monday 
a note to that effect was not made public in court although the 
42page admission was 
an official who saw the note commenting on condition he not be 
named said it was at the bottom of a cover letter to us district 
judge gerhard a gesell from independent counsel lawrence walsh 
the statement of facts agreed to by both the government and 
norths lawyers was introduced to avoid the risks of national 
security secrets being disclosed through testimony or documents 
that might be put in evidence 
among the disclosures in the admission was that george bush 
then vice president told the president of honduras that his nation 
would be getting expedited us military and economic aid earlier 
testimony had indicated thenpresident reagan told the honduran 
president such help would be forthcoming in return for his 
assisting the nicaraguan guerrillas

the attorney general said monday that 
arresting mexicos biggest reputed drug lord and six police 
officials in a weekend sweep was a blow at corruption and he vowed 
the crackdown will continue 
enrique alvarez del castillo told reporters arresting men like 
miguel angel felix gallardo 43 was one of the top priorities 
of president carlos salinas de gortaris new administration 
in addition to felix gallardo and three aides the sweep netted 
the top federal antidrug official in the alleged drug kingpins 
home state and five other ranking police officials alvarez said 
the raids were the third dramatic example of salinas 
determination in january he put the previously untouchable leader 
of the corrupt oil workers union behind bars and in february a 
leading stockbroker went to jail 
we will press on regardless of where it leads alvarez said 
ed heath head of the us drug enforcement agency in mexico 
said the message is that president salinas de gortari means 
business 
felix gallardo thought to head a ring that smuggled up to four 
tons of cocaine a month into the united states had been sought for 
years but obtained protection from diverse authorities alvarez 
said 
he called felix gallardo the no 1 drug trafficker in mexico 
and said radios highpowered weapons and several ounces of cocaine 
also were seized in the raids 
us officials believe felix gallardos empire which employs 
thousands of people is responsible for more than half the cocaine 
that passes through mexico to the united states 
us authorities believe felix gallardo was involved in the 1985 
slaying of american drug agent enrique camarena salazar but 
alvarez said felix gallardo opposed killing camarena and that he 
had no evidence linking the reputed drug boss directly to the 
killing 
alvarez added however that felix gallardo was the 
intellectual author of the organization that killed camarena 
us officials investigating the murder of camarena who was 
kidnapped outside the us consulate in guadalajara said felix 
gallardo built an immense operation with protection from high 
officials including a state governor 
he was arrested saturday night in guadalajara 
it was clean work without a single gunshot said rene 
hernandez a spokesman for the attorney general alvarez said felix 
gallardo was being questioned in mexico city 
a statement from the attorney generals office said the raids 
resulted from salinas vow to stop drug dealing and corruption in 
mexico 
while federal judicial police were seizing felix gallardo in the 
western state of jalisco soldiers arrested every policeman on the 
force in his hometown of culiacan capital of sinaloa state in 
northwest mexico 
alvarez said federal authorities did not trust the police in 
sinaloa and wanted to avoid a shootout most of the officers soon 
were released 
we regret that people who have a responsibility to society 
have become involved in these events gov francisco labastida 
ochoa of sinaloa state said in a statement early monday 
heath told reporters to pull this thing off the way it was 
done is a tribute to the mexican government the impact it has 
on the drug market we can say is extremely significant 
authorities seized some of felix gallardos assets monday 
including a guadalajara hotel pharmacy realestate company bank 
accounts and various properties 
us officials have estimated his net worth at more than 500 
million including at least 50 houses and 200 ranches 
felix gallardo was thought to run one of the worlds largest 
cocaine trafficking operations heath said he was as important as 
any major trafficker in south america and added felix gallardo 
has been operating almost with impunity in mexico because of 
the protection he received 
the reputed drug baron was said to have have made an alliance 
with colombias notorious medellin cartel to move cocaine through 
mexico to the united states

three recovering alcoholics from the soviet 
union shared the first day of their visit to the united states with 
a fellow sufferer kitty dukakis on a tour of an alcoholism unit 
at a manhattan hospital monday 
alcoholics are the same in moscow and in new york and in 
boston and all over the world they share the same disease mrs 
dukakis said after the tour at bellevue hospital 
mrs dukakis the wife of massachusetts governor michael 
dukakis was treated for alcoholism in february following her 
husbands unsuccessful campaign as democratic presidential 
candidate 
the three soviets identified only as sasha victor and volodja 
are visiting the united states for two weeks to learn about the 
treatment of alcoholism here they are the guests of the 
sovietus joint conference on alcoholism drug addiction and 
peace 
alcoholism is the most democratic of diseases said the rev 
jw canty the chairman of the joint conference and an episcopal 
priest from new york city who lives in moscow 
it happens to auto workers along the volga river and it 
happens to auto workers in detroit it happens to first ladies in 
the united states and it happens to cleaning ladies in moscow he 
said 
canty estimated that there are 10 million alcoholics in the 
united states and 10 million to 15 million in the soviet union 
the soviet visitors overcame their 20year drinking problems 
through moscow beginners the first antidrinking group for soviet 
citizens that is registered with alcoholics anonymous said canty 
who helped start the group in 1987 
the three men whose last names were withheld had tried 
unsuccessfully for years to dry out in staterun facilities for 
alcoholics he added 
i think the principle of alcoholics anonymous is more 
effective because it depends on the person himself because it 
depends on his friends in alcoholics anonymous said victor a 
film producer through a translator 
in the soviet union alcoholics undergo compulsory 
hospitalization for as long as six months and are forced to spend 
up to two years in institutions reserved for those who cannot be 
cured by the hospitals 
the fact that it aa is one recovering alcoholic helping 
another one introduces a whole new experience of trust and honesty 
and mutual dependency which the soviet people are not familiar 
with canty said 
mrs dukakis was on hand at kennedy international airport to 
greet the soviet visitors and their translator helen kuzmicheva 
who runs the sovietus alcoholism center in moscow a 
westernstyle outpatient clinic that opened april 3 
mrs dukakis then accompanied them for a quick burger and shake 
at a fast food restaurant in midtown before going to the hospital 
dr marc galanter the director of the division of alcohol and 
drug abuse at bellevue said the soviets seemed to be favorably 
impressed with the hospital 
i think they would have to go a ways in moscow to equal the 
setup here he added 
during their twoweek visit the soviets will also visit the 
world headquarters of alcoholics anonymous in new york attend open 
aa meetings and visit chit chat farms an alcoholism rehabilitation 
center in warnersville pa

the head of swedens secret service 
resigned monday a day before a report was to be submitted to the 
government on the counterespionage agency 
the report by a member of the governing social democratic party 
purportedly criticizes the services effectiveness after the 
killing of prime minister olof palme in 1986 
sune sandstrom said his resignation will take effect as soon as 
the government names a replacement sandstrom 49 was appointed in 
1987 to head the sakerhetspolis or security police known as sapo 
sandstrom issued a statement saying he was quitting because the 
government appeared to want a sapo chief with a broader base of 
experience and who was more than a policeman 
sandstrom has been criticized for allegedly allowing book 
publisher ebbe carlsson to conduct his own investigation last year 
into the palme killing when the police search failed to determine 
the gunman who killed the prime minister as he was walking along a 
stockholm street 
sandstrom also allegedly was implicated in connection with an 
attempt to smuggle illegal wiretapping equipment into sweden 
the scandal over carlssons private investigation previously 
brought about the resignations of the head of the national police 
nils erik ahmansson and justice minister anna greta leijon 
carl bildt head of the opposition conservative party said he 
feared the government may appoint a politician to head sapo 
i am worried we must have an efficient security police to 
protect ourselves against spies and terrorists he said on 
national radio 
a 42yearold man suspected in palmes killing was arrested dec 
14 officials have said the trial of christer pettersson will start 
may 29 and is expected to last at least four weeks pettersson has

news that a handsome aide to the queen wrote 
personal letters to princess anne prompted new page one speculation 
monday that annes marriage is on the rocks but her fatherinlaw 
denied the marriage has broken down 
anne herself the 38yearold daughter of queen elizabeth ii 
smiled through a typically busy day of engagements 
as scotland yard investigated the theft of the letters from the 
princess desk at buckingham palace britains tabloids questioned 
in banner headlines whether her 15year marriage to fellow 
equestrian mark phillips would survive 
can this marriage be saved asked the daily mail anne 
divorce crisis at palace said today royal marriage crisis 
anne sad shattered alone trumpeted the daily mirror 
maj peter phillips annes 68yearold fatherinlaw denied 
the marriage was washed up he told reporters its not the sort 
of marriage that ordinary people would understand at all they 
spend so much time away from one another 
if people are royal they dont necessarily spend lots of time 
together its inevitable princess anne and mark come together and 
they part doing the various jobs which they have got to do 
one does not inquire about when they last got together of 
course their marriage is very unusual 
phillips added mark rang me last night sunday he would 
confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the conversation 
was about horses the marriage side of things was not discussed 
at all 
the three principals at the heart of the speculation remained 
silent on the subject 
anne appeared in a happy mood as she carried out a busy schedule 
of activities in northwest england including opening a 68 million 
shopping center in liverpool 
margaret maguire a shopper who talked with anne said later 
she is beautiful a credit to her country it is her own life 
and the press should leave her alone 
phillips a 40yearold commoner and former captain in the 
queens dragoon guards spent the day at the couples gatcombe park 
estate in western england 
royal navy cmdr timothy laurence the 34yearold bachelor who 
wrote the stolen letters was at windsor castle continuing with 
his normal duties as an equerry or aide to the queen buckingham 
palace said 
rumors of trouble in the princess marriage have circulated 
since 1981 in recent years she and her husband have spent up to 
six months a year apart 
anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired members 
of the royal family undertaking grueling travels on behalf of 
children in povertystricken and wartorn third world countries 
phillips has also traveled widely for a variety of business and 
equestrian interests 
on their 15th anniversary on nov 15 anne attended a buckingham 
palace ball while phillips was giving riding lessons in australia 
britains tabloids have tried to link anne to a former bodyguard 
and actor anthony andrews and phillips to one of his stable girls 
a canadian public relations executive and pamella bordes a former 
miss india who worked as a researcher in the house of commons 
the latest rumors began after the sun britains 
largestcirculation tabloid reported thursday that four letters 
stolen from anne had been sent anonymously to the paper and turned 
over to scotland yard 
after a sunday newspaper told buckingham palace it was going to 
name the letterwriter the palace identified laurence who served 
on the royal yacht britannia before become a top aide to the queen 
it described him as a friend of the princess but refused to 
disclose the contents 
the daily mirror which called the letters highly personal 
said monday that the princess had visited laurences home in 
winchester at least half a dozen times sometimes with her two 
children peter 11 and zara 7 
harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes peerage 
said the matter cannot be left hanging in the air like this 
there is a precedent for a royal divorce annes aunt princess 
margaret the queens only sister was divorced in 1978 from lord 
snowden who has since remarried anne herself is seventh in line 
to the throne far enough down the line of succession not to create 
problems for the monarchy if she were to divorce 
nigel dempster britains bestknown gossip columnist who writes 
in the daily mail said anne and phillips havent divorced because 
neither wants to marry someone else 
i think everyone including mark and the royal family have been 
aware that the marriage as such had been over for a very long 
time he told the bbc

a lone kayaker and other antinuclear 
activists confronted a barge carrying the containment vessel from 
one of the nations oldest commercial nuclear reactors as it moved 
up the columbia river on monday 
the kayaker stan overbay paddled out to the barge and placed 
himself in front of the lead tugboat but a coast guard vessel 
jockeyed him out of the way and the barge continued without 
stopping 
the concrete and steelencased reactor vessel from 
shippingport pa is on the last leg of an 8000mile voyage to 
burial at the hanford wash nuclear reservation the us 
department of energy said radioactive fuel has been removed from 
the shell and it poses no threat to public health 
the barge passed into the colombia river near astoria monday 
morning and was expected to complete the 100mile journey to 
portland after dark said lt commander david gault of the coast 
guard 
near astoria the tug that brought the barge from pennsylvania 
through the panama canal turned back and was replaced by a tug 
owned by knappton shipping co of astoria gault said 
about 20 people staged a protest at an astoria pier as the barge 
passed by and demonstrations also were planned at portland and 
hood river about 65 miles up river from portland 
a person standing six feet from the 1000ton container vessel 
would receive no more radiation than they would from the sun over 
the same period according to the department of energy 
if it really is so safe why does it need coast guard cutters 
guarding it and why wouldnt they say when its coming said 
joanne oleksiak of the northwest radiation alert network 
she said northwest residents dont want the columbia which 
forms the border between washington and oregon used as a 
thoroughfare for nuclear waste 
its not the kind of thing people want passing by their picnic 
or their houseboat she said 
the coast guard has established a safety zone 400 yards ahead 
200 yards behind and 100 years to either side of the barge and 
violators face criminal and civil penalities said coast guard 
petty officer bret koontz in seattle 
gault said there have been several shipments up the columbia in 
which safety zones were established 
this is nothing new for us he said the only difference 
this time is theres been more publicity

an israeli wearing army fatigues opened fire 
with an uzi submachine gun monday evening killing a palestinian 
and wounding three as they sat on the grass outside the walled old 
city police and witnesses reported 
israel radio said an anonymous telephone caller speaking hebrew 
with a french accent claimed responsibility in the name of the 
sicarites group which has made several arson attacks on leftwing 
israeli targets 
in other developments monday 
police spokesmen said chaim barlev the police minister 
issued orders that bar some young palestinians from praying at the 
al aqsa mosque complex one of islams holiest sites 
a military source said lt gen dan shomron the chief of 
staff forced a colonel to resign because of attacks on 
palestinians by soldiers he commanded the daily maariv called it 
the harshest action in more than a decade against an officer of 
such a high rank serving in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in the west bank town of hebron troops shot and killed an arab 
stonethrower an army spokesman said israel radio identified the 
slain man as jamil natche and said he was shot when a group of 
masked people attacked an army jeep with stones 
arab hospital officials said five palestainians were wounded by 
army gunfire in the west bank and gaza strip the army confirmed 
two people were wounded and said it was investigating 
natches death raised to 423 the number of arabs killed in the 
palestinian uprising that began in december 1987 eighteen israelis 
also have been slain in violence related to the uprising 
according to israel radios account of the attack in jerusalem 
the caller described the shooting as retaliation for stoning 
attacks on jews 
the assailant escaped by foot after the shooting at about 740 
pm near the jaffa gate a main entrance to the old city 
mahmoud zahdeh 20 a hotel waiter interviewed in his hospital 
bed said he and friends were resting after a day of fasting in the 
moslem holy month of ramadan 
four of us were sitting on the lawn near the jaffa gate eating 
pumpkin seeds when a soldier in his late 30s with slightly gray 
hair approached us and looked at us for a while he said 
he was wearing a military uniform but with no hat and was 
carrying a short rifle he left and returned two minutes later he 
did not talk to us he only started shooting 
zahdeh was shot five times and had wounds in the shoulders left 
leg and scalp 
reporters who arrived moments after the shooting said the body 
of a man in his 30s was beside the wall and more than a dozen empty 
cartridge casings were scattered about police identified the dead 
man as khaled shawish 26 a blacksmith from the old city 
officials at bikur holim hospital said a 19yearold factory 
worker from jerusalem was in critical condition with chest and head 
wounds and a cousin of the dead man was being treated for wounds 
to the lower stomach arms and legs 
yosef yehudai of the jerusalem police said of the attacker he 
did not shout as far as we know he never said a word and his 
movements were sudden he was standing five meters from his 
victims very close 
barlevs order barring some arabs from praying at al aqsa is 
believed to be without precedent palestinians rioted outside the 
mosque friday the first day of ramadan and some of the rocks 
thrown struck jews praying at the nearby western wall the holiest 
shrine of judaism 
about 4000 palestinians were involved in the riots during 
which 12 people were reported injured and 37 arabs were arrested 
rafi levy the police spokesman said in explaining barlevs 
order there will be restrictions against those who we fear might 
disrupt order which means youths from the territories every 
violation of public order will be met with an immediate response 
he said moslem worshipers would be required to give police their 
identity cards before entering the mosque complex 
since capturing the old city in 1967 israel has taken pride in 
allowing free access to holy sites of all religions during the 
uprising however it sometimes has blocked traffic from the 
occupied lands to prevent riots at al aqsa after midday prayers on 
friday the moslem sabbath 
col yehuda meir decided to quit after shomron said he would 
have to stand trial otherwise the military source said 
meir was military governor of nablus in the west bank when the 
uprising started and maariv said the investigation dealt with two 
incidents 
last year in kfar salem near nablus soldiers under meirs 
command used a bulldozer to bury four palestinians the victims 
survived

worried parents pulled 10 to 20 children 
out of classes monday after a drawing of an assault rifle and the 
words youre dead were found spraypainted on a school wall 10 
days after telephone threats against pupils 
state police escorted buses from the school as they did last 
week after the two anonymous phone threats 
police said the graffiti including the phrase youre gonzo 
appeared to be the work of juveniles and not of the person who made 
the threats 
the graffiti was found on an outside wall of the junior high 
school the school is part of the brooklyn school which has three 
buildings and serves about 850 students in kindergarten through 
ninth grade 
doors were locked and police were stationed at the school 
the graffiti was removed but not until after most of the pupils 
saw it school officials said 
some parents picked up their children rather than having them 
take the buses which serve about 98 percent of the students from 
the school in the rural area of northeastern connecticut students 
were not allowed to walk or bicycle home and buses were loaded one 
at a time 
maybe it is kids playing a prank but why take a chance 
said barbara devolve who decided to drive her son home rather than 
having him go by bus devolve said she would probably keep her 
12yearold son bobby out of school the rest of the week 
although he had insisted pupils were not worried 
im just not going to tempt fate said chris crawford who 
came to pick up his son and daughter both of whom usually ride the 
bus 
most youngsters are taking it in stride they are probably 
less concerned about it than parents who worry more because they 
are not here to see whats going on said superintendent of 
schools louise berry 
school officials had hoped to restore a sense of normalcy monday 
after six school days of heightened security measures taken after 
a woman warned in a march 30 telephone call to town hall that she 
planned to shoot children in the schoolyard 
the next morning a female caller police are unsure if it was 
the same woman telephoned a school bus coordinator and threatened 
to kill the children on the bus driven by the coordinators wife 
school administrators have told parents they believe there is no 
danger but have left to families the decision on whether to keep 
children out of school berry said 
she said the school system would probably have to end its long 
practice of allowing parents and others to come and go from the 
buildings as they wish 
we now have to face the fact that its probably not wise to 
have such freedoms berry said its sad

arab states should help israel pay to establish 
a human condition for the hundreds of thousands of palestinians 
living in refugee camps in occupied territories israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said monday 
israel doesnt have the financial means to solve all these 
problems in the refugee camps shamir said at a news conference 
during a daylong trip to chicago to promote a middle east peace 
plan he proposed last week 
it couldnt substitute for a political solution but it could 
improve the climate he said 
according to un relief officials who manage the refugee camps 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip about 335000 
palestinians live in the camps altogether about 17 million 
palestinians live in the occupied lands most in towns and cities 
shamir estimated it would cost 1 billion to solve problems in 
the camps 
there is a need to organize to provide housing and to 
establish a human condition for their life there shamir said 
shamir also detailed some of the issues he discussed last week 
with president bush and secretary of state james baker iii and 
said israel would listen to any proposal brought to the negotiating 
table under a plan proposed thursday to the bush administration 
the plan calls for palestinian balloting to select 
representatives who would negotiate an interim solution of 
selfrule in the west bank and gaza strip israel seized those 
territories from neighboring arab states in the 1967 middle east 
war and they have been the site of an uprising palestinian leaders 
say wont end until israel withdraws 
asked whether israel would consider negotiating land for peace 
shamir said land is not the issue now but the country would listen 
to any proposal 
we will listen to anything he said both parties will 
listen to all proposals that are brought to the table of 
negotiations 
it will be a full self rule for perhaps five years while a 
permanent solution to the arabisraeli conflict is negotiated 
shamir said 
it will have all the power of a government except security and 
foreign relations he said there will be some problems they 
will have to settle with the authorities of israel 
shamir discounted comments sunday by the opposition labor party 
leader finance minister shimon peres peres said israel had in 
effect abandoned its longstanding refusal to negotiate with the 
palestine liberation organization by letting the united states 
mediate a proposal that could result in plo supporters being 
elected 
we dont see the plo as a factor in the peace initiative he 
said but we will try to negotiate with palestinian arabs that 
are interested in peace 
he also called for a meeting to celebrate the 1979 camp david 
accords which shamir labled the most successful endeavor to 
resolve the arabisraeli crisis 
shamirs plan is a modified version of the accords but it 
differs in that it calls for elections followed by negotiations on 
autonomy 
the anniversary meeting would review prospects for enlarging 
the peace process shamir said 
shamir was to travel to new york later monday to discuss the 
plan with jewish groups before returning to israel on thursday to 
begin working out the details of the peace plan

four people were convicted monday on 
charges stemming from the secondlargest cash heist in us 
history a 71 million wells fargo robbery allegedly used to fund 
a group seeking to overthrow the government in puerto rico 
one defendant was acquitted 
key defendant juan segarra palmer iii was convicted on robbery 
conspiracy and transportation of stolen money charges he was found 
innocent on four weaponsrelated charges all charges stemmed from 
the sept 12 1983 theft of cash from the wells fargo depot in 
west hartford 
segarra a 39yearold harvard university graduate who was 
charged in all 16 counts of the indictment faces up to 165 years 
in prison his bond was revoked 
also convicted were were antonio camacho negron 45 a car 
mechanic norman ramirez talavera 32 a graphic artist and robert 
maldonado rivera 53 a lawyer the only defendant cleared was 
carlos ayes suarez 29 an anthropology student 
camacho faces up to 15 years in prison the others face up to 
five years each no date for sentencing was set 
camachos wife rebecca and two other supporters of the 
defendants were arrested later for blocking traffic outside the 
courthouse 
as he was led from the courtroom camacho raised a clenched fist 
an denounced the proceedings in spanish 
linda backiel camachos attorney said he yelled the 
imperial power is showing how small it is she said comacho would 
appeal his conviction 
there are a lot of errors and it was a slim case she said 
because he was a puerto rican patriot he never expected justice 
and he wont ask for mercy 
the defense put the system on trial and after nine days the 
jury came back with a verdict that was well reasoned and proved 
that the system works said us attorney stanley a twardy jr 
segarra acknowledged he knew about the robbery beforehand and 
received the stolen money to finance the activities of los 
macheteros spanish for machetewielders a group seeking the 
overthrow of the us government in puerto rico 
but segarra steadfastly denied that he helped plan or execute 
the robbery as the government charged 
the other four defendants were charged with conspiracy and with 
either helping transport the stolen money or using part of it to 
finance three kings day toy giveaways in hartford and puerto rico 
on jan 6 1985 
the government contended that los macheteros recruited wells 
fargo guard victor gerena to carry out the robbery then helped 
gerena escape to cuba where he is believed to live now 
segarras attorney leonard weinglass said he was disappointed 
by the verdict he said his clients chances of a successful appeal 
were very good 
weinglass contended that the jury reached what he characterized 
as an illegal compromise verdict by convicting segarra on robbery 
charges but clearing him of weapons violations 
ayes said he would return to puerto rico with mixed emotions he 
accused prosecutors of trying to criminalize the proindependence 
movement of our country 
as long as puerto rico is still a colony we have a moral 
obligation to fight for the independence of our country by whatever 
means are available he said 
the government presented 110 witnesses and more than 700 pieces 
of evidence including taperecorded conversations and documents 
seized from los macheteros members 
during the 5month trial prosecutors presented evidence that 
los macheteros were desperate for money in 1983 and that segarra 
was put in charge of getting it other evidence indicated segarra 
was sent from puerto rico to new england more than a month before 
the robbery and returned to the island within weeks afterward 
about 80000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized 
by fbi agents during searches in puerto rico and boston on aug 30 
1985 when 13 people were arrested the government contends that 
los macheteros spent about 1 million moved more than 2 million 
to cuba and squirreled away 4 million in safety deposit boxes 
certificates of deposit savings accounts and farmhouse cellars in 
puerto rico 
weinglass segarras attorney asserted during closing arguments 
that the robbery itself was so unprofessional that it couldnt have 
been planned by a sophisticated clandestine organization 
he noted that for his getaway gerena rented an old jalopy he 
couldnt rely on and it took him more an hour to move the halfton 
of cash from the wells fargo vault into the cars trunk 
if a sophisticated group had been involved weinglass said 
other people would have been there to help 
weinglass also attacked the credibility of two key government 
witnesses segarras friend kenneth cox and segarras former 
lover anne gassin weinglass called cox a paid liar who received 
15000 from the fbi for his testimony and described gassin as a 
spurned lover intimidated into testifying because she herself faced 
charges of laundering some of the stolen money 
the other defendants claimed they were victims of mistaken 
identity and faulty government logic the government failed to 
prove they said that they were the people overheard through 
electronic surveillance and identified only by code name while 
discussing the robbery 
defense attorneys also argued their clients were being 
prosecuted because of their support for puerto rican independence 
and for legitimate activities for los macheteros 
two other defendants lawyer paul s weinberg of springfield 
mass and segarras wife luz berrios berrios pleaded guilty to 
reduced charges before the trial began oct 11 nine others await 
trial while the government appeals the judges dismissal of some 
taperecorded evidence 
the largest cash theft in us history 79 million occurred 
at another wells fargo depot in new york city on april 29 1985

an antiapartheid campaigner from south africa 
said monday relations with the soviet union would not be possible 
until apartheid is abolished the official news agency tass 
reported 
frederick van zyl slabbert heading a delegation from the 
institute for a democratic alternative for south africa met 
members of the communist party central committee foreign ministry 
officials and members of the academy of sciences africa institute 
he later told a news conference that for a political settlement 
in south africa to become a reality all detainees must be 
released the 34monthold state of emergency must be lifted and 
apartheid dismantled tass said 
the delegations conclusion was that as long as apartheid 
exists in south africa there can be no question of diplomatic 
relations between that country and the soviet union tass quoted 
van zyl slabbert as saying 
he said it was obvious the soviet union wanted to play a 
constructive role and cooperate with other nations in settling the 
conflict between the pretoria government and the outlawed and 
exiled african national congress 
tass quoted van zyl slabbert as saying that before he visited 
moscow he saw the soviet union as a country devoted to exporting 
revolution and hoping to destroy south africa by using the anc as a 
proxy 
delegation members had believed they would be closely watched 
and forcefed soviet views but none of this actually happened and 
he would now advise all his acquaintances to visit the soviet 
union tass said 
apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

arson caused fires at two womens clinics 
that went up in flames hours before a massive proabortion rally 
began in washington investigators said monday 
accelerants were used in both fires said robert creighton of 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
investigators have not ruled out a link between the fires in 
ocalaand fort myers which both occurred before dawn sunday fort 
myers is on floridas southwest coast ocala is about 150 miles to 
the north 
meanwhile about 70 abortionrights activists riding in two 
buses stopped in ocala on their way home from the washington rally 
to hold a vigil at the gutted all womens health clinic 
we wanted to show the state of florida that we will continue 
to work to continue to have a choice said candice slaughter a 
management consultant from the tampa area 
this does not deter us it sets us back on our heels but it 
does not deter us said deborah struthers president of the ocala 
clinic and the fort myers womens health center she said both 
facilities would reopen in temporary locations 
the ocala fire was the second in two weeks and appeared to be 
the work of the arsonist who tried to burn the clinic march 31 
causing an estimated 60000 damage authorities said 
local antiabortion activists denied responsibility in sundays 
attacks but said they hoped the clinics would not be able to 
reopen 
i dont condone the destruction of property but im ecstatic 
that they will not be able to perform abortions there said tom 
ranew an adoption attorney who was arrested at a sitin in orlando 
last october 
ms struthers said she had expected picketing at the ocala 
clinic by abortion opponents as a reaction to the march that 
brought more than 300000 demonstrators to washington 
i just didnt prepare well enough she added it just 
never dawned on us that someone would be that disturbed and 
unstable and aggressive and vicious

the army chief of staff on monday 
announced a major reshaping of the armed forces to bring in younger 
officers who are more experienced in fighting communist insurgents 
gen renato de villa told a news conference 32 key positions 
were involved half of the officers to be rotated are generals he 
added 
the 163000 strong military has been fighting communist 
guerrillas for the last 20 years it also faces a moslem separatist 
rebellion in the southern philippines 
de villa dismissed speculation that the planned revamping was a 
reaction to persistent news media reports of graft and corruption 
in the military 
this is to improve the firepower of the armed forces and this 
was planned during the first quarter of the year he said it 
is unfair to say that these officers were rotated because of graft 
and corruption 
de villa said another changeover is scheduled this year to 
replace 10 generals who are retiring

the devil doesnt get his due in temptation 
vaclav havels reworking of the faust legend but then neither does 
the audience 
thats surprising considering the play by czechoslovakias 
leading playwright now in prison for dissident activities has 
been directed by a fellow czech jiri zizka the director with his 
wife blanka runs the highly regarded wilma theater in 
philadelphia where temptation will go after its new york run 
but you cant find the play because of zizkas elaborate and 
selfconscious staging that suffocates the drama and the actors in 
it as well much of temptation which opened over the weekend 
at the new york shakespeare festival public theater is set in a 
science laboratory engaged in what seems to be some kind of 
sinister work the setting allows zizka and set designer jerry rojo 
to fill the stage with hightech scenery accented by slide 
projections smoke screens and weird sound effects 
they are the same devices zizka used several seasons ago in his 
version of george orwells 1984 done at the joyce theater but 
orwells novel of a harrowing future adapted well to zizkas 
stagey devices 
here they seem to overwhelm the actors including such fine 
performers as david strathairn who plays the faust prototype dr 
henry foustka and bill moor as the mincing master of the science 
institute 
foustka dabbles in black magic and his sorcery conjures up a 
mysterious stranger who sounds like laurence olivier and dresses 
like a bowery panhandler is the man a representative of the devil 
or the repressive government that runs the laboratory or are they 
one and the same 
havels conclusion is surprisingly obvious it just takes him a 
long time 10 scenes spread over more than 2 hours to get 
there in between there are foustkas dalliances with several 
women in the lab including a young secretary who is a counterpart 
to fausts doomed margaret shes played here with remarkable 
sympathy by katherine hiler 
havels polemics get more of a workout in foustkas verbal 
sparring with that shabbily dressed stranger some of their 
arguments crackle displaying the passion havel obviously has for 
the free exchange of ideas but in the end their conversations are 
overshadowed by zizkas theatrical tricks making the battle for 
foustkas soul not a very interesting war

a former police officer whose acquittal in the 
beating death of a black man led to race riots in 1980 was arrested 
along with a federal agent on drug charges authorities said monday 
the former officer alex marrero 34 and federal drug agent 
jorge villar 44 were charged with conspiring to distribute 
cocaine and conspiring to commit bribery after their weekend 
arrests which followed a sting operation 
marreros acquittal in the beating death of businessman arthur 
mcduffie sparked a riot that left 18 people dead and caused 80 
million in property damage in may 1980 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said marrero and villar had 
offered to protect a man who was posing as a smuggler bringing 
cocaine from the bahamas into an area near miami beach the man was 
actually working with government agents 
marrero and villar provided protection for this load of 
cocaine and in return demanded a fee of 300000 he said and 
marrero got 10 percent of the fee in cash 
according to an affidavit villar had certificates of deposit 
worth more than 300000 in a briefcase when he was arrested 
today we demonstrate no matter who you are or what you think 
you know if you deal in drugs you can be caught lehtinen told a 
news conference 
us magistrate william c turnoff ordered marrero and villar 
back to the federal metropolitan correctional center where they 
have been held without bond since saturday 
prosecutors asked that they be held as dangers to the community 
and because of the risk they might flee turnoff said he would make 
a decision on bonds for the two tuesday 
diane cossin executive assistant to lehtinen said conviction 
on the conspiracy and bribery charges would lead to automatic 
10year federal prison terms for the two men and possible life 
sentences she said other charges may be filed 
marrero was suspended from the metrodade force early in 1980 
after an investigation revealed that mcduffie had been beaten to 
death by police officers after a highway chase marrero the chief 
defendant in the case was charged with seconddegree murder 
an allwhite jury in tampa later acquitted him and three other 
officers of all criminal charges within hours the miami area 
especially suburban liberty city was rocked by riots that lasted 
three days 
marrero later tried to rejoin the metrodade police force but 
in 1981 a county hearing examiner upheld his firing he has held 
several jobs since including security guard and personal bodyguard

connie stevens didnt want a fulltime role 
when she signed on for starting from scratch then she began to 
worry that her recurring character could be seen as an uncaring 
occasional mother 
its a more difficult role than i had anticipated she said 
i dont want to be a fool or a mother who doesnt care and gives 
the wrong message 
in the syndicated comedy series which also stars bill daily 
she plays a runaway wife and mother who suddenly returns home after 
five years she wants to pick up where she left off and win back 
her husbands affection 
stevens said shes trying to play the role as a mother who cant 
cope who ran away once but cant cut the umbilical cord 
i dont see them getting back together she said if they 
do then its another domestic comedy the fun is that theyre not 
married they havent found anyone else but they still cling to 
each other i didnt want to play a mother who just pops in the 
door being a single mother i know there are a lot of problems 
ive had trouble balancing the gags with the reality 
stevens originally was supposed to be only a parttime character 
in the show which focuses on daily and their two teenagers 
it looked perfect for me she said i could come in play 
a show and disappear then i found that as the show become popular 
i was in every show and having to stay in montreal where its 
made 
stevens said she was concerned however about where her 
character was going 
i didnt know where they were taking my character and they 
didnt know where the character was going she said we havent 
resolved it yet it appealed to me because im a single parent 
myself with two children 
i felt i could make it interesting i didnt want to be an 
exwife who had no life of her own no viewpoint of her own and who 
was mercenary in the pilot i was throwing credit cards around like 
crazy 
you can only get away with that if theres a great friendship 
and a great love as a foundation shes always borrowing money from 
him shes never balanced a checkbook she cant hold a job 
this is the first series in a number of years for stevens who 
is probably still best known for her role as cricket on hawaiian 
eye in the 1950s 
she was born in brooklyn ny but came to los angeles with her 
fathers band as a singer she soon found her way into films 
she played the goofy young singerphotographer in hawaiian 
eye which centered on two private detectives played by anthony 
eisley and bob conrad poncie ponce was kim the taxi driver 
the show frequently had crossovers with 77 sunset strip she 
and edd kookie byrnes of that show recorded the hit song 
kookie kookie lend me your comb 
the entire budget for all the actors was 1100 a week she 
said i got 50 a week more than anyone else because i let them 
take top billing 
theres talk of making a reunion movie stevens said she has 
written a story for the movie that brings all the characters back 
and serves as a pilot for four new spinoff characters 
almost 30 years after playing cricket stevens still looks young 
and vivacious in 1974 she played a marilyn monroetype character 
in the tv movie the sex symbol 
stevens lived in england when she was going through her divorce 
from singer eddie fisher the father of her two daughters while in 
england she worked on her last regular series the des oconnor 
show in 1971 
i took a house outside of london she said i learned to 
deal with people again the english are great for that

after leaving the crew to set up the 
next shot in the smoky nightclub mark rosner walks purposefully up 
the street toward his office trailer 
he passes a woman with a glazed look in her eyes rougesmeared 
cheeks frightful blond hair and snowwhite fingernails 
rosner shakes his head when she is out of earshot extras 
never look as good as real people he says with a sigh 
in the office rosner sinks into a corner to talk about dream 
street the series he is writing and directing for nbc it 
premieres thursday in a 90minute special before moving to its 
regular hourlong time period on fridays 
from the first twang of the guitar on after midnight and the 
best opening credits since miami vice its clear this is a 
different kind of television series 
already dubbed variously dirtysomething or 
twentysomething a comparison with the hit abc series 
thirtysomething that comes from the same executive producers 
ed zwick and marshall herskovitz dream street is a 
noholdsbarred tale of 20s when young people are hit with the 
realities of adulthood 
dale midkiff elvis and me stars as denis debeau who takes 
over the family refrigeration business after his father has a 
stroke bypassing his anguished failure of an older brother harry 
peter frechette thomas calabro plays denis best friend joey 
coltrera who is joining his fathers business too organized 
crime 
rosner offers his own catchphrase for the show 
i started calling it rock n roll television because i 
dont want people to call it like bluecollar television to me 
that sounds like real 50s kitchensink goodforyou television 
and thats not it he said the fact that the characters are 
workingclass is the context in which the stories take place to 
me what its really about is being in your 20s and trying to be a 
grownup for the first time really 
to me all the great rock n roll is about that stuff and 
also just because it moves real fast and it looks real hot and the 
energy is real high on this show that handle seems to make sense 
to me 
the only thing missing from a rock n roll show set in new 
jersey is the boss 
no one mentions bruce springsteen we dont use his music 
rosner said i think we owe him a debt in that the texture of the 
show and the kind of stories we tell are very much in the vein of 
the songs that he sings but were not ridin on his coattails or 
trying exploit him or anything like that 
theres so much springsteen on the page and on the screen to 
have him on the soundtrack would be superfluous 
dream street derived from a network executives suggestion 
for a show that was young sexy urban zwick and herskovitz 
developed the idea but thirtysomething was picked up in the 
meantime and dream street put on hold until rosner took it 
over he had met zwick and herskovitz at the american film 
institute when all three were aspiring film directors 
herskovitz in an interview in his office in studio city 
calif where he was overseeing thirtysomething said he and 
zwick who was off filming a movie could not possibly have 
considered doing the second show if we didnt have someone like 
mark 
ed and i have been able to be very influential in a lot of the 
conceptual and creative elements of the show but at the same time 
what we share with mark is the idea of what it means to be a 
filmmaker i dont tell him how to make his shots herskovitz 
said 
what dream street does have in common with 
thirtysomething is reliance on character more than plot joni 
goldstein cecil hoffman is engaged to joey but only her cynical 
roommate kara christine moore realizes what kind of life shes 
in for denis meanwhile courts a reluctant elementary school 
teacher jo anderson his youngest brother david gray runs wild 
drinking and carousing that this behavior meets with big brothers 
approval at least in the pilot is bound to raise some eyebrows 
rosner who is from valley stream ny said he was urged to 
consider other shooting locations but insisted on filming dream 
street in new jersey 
anything youd want to do in a real urban show is right here 
within five or eight miles of hoboken rosner said plus 
youve got the incomparable view of the city the emerald city 
across the river which believe me they dont have in knoxville 
or vancouver

the democratic national chairman said he 
couldnt resist so he didnt republicans ron brown said 
read my lips jill long 
thats hardly a household name but the republicans who heard 
him certainly recognized it jill long is a very junior member of 
congress from indiana shes just won the seat once held by vice 
president dan quayle 
now the republicans are battling to defend another house seat in 
wyoming where they have nothing to gain but a lot to lose 
one more special election defeat and their national campaign 
managers are going to have a hard time convincing anybody that 
their newlook strategy for house contests is going to work 
anywhere 
so far they are down two in special house elections in 1989 
losing narrowly in indiana and overwhelmingly in a democratic 
district in alabama 
now they are on defense again trying to hold a republican seat 
wyomings next and i think weve got to fight like the devil 
to win said republican national chairman lee atwater 
this time the laboratory is a whole state the atlarge wyoming 
house seat richard b cheney gave up to become secretary of 
defense the election will be held on april 26 
republican cheney held it by widening margins in six elections 
but democrat john vinich is the betterknown contender of the 
candidates to succeed cheney after narrowly losing a 1988 senate 
race vinich 38 is a state senator the republican candidate is 
craig thomas 55 a state representative who casts himself as the 
kind of moderate conservative wyoming voters chose in cheney and 
in their two gop senators 
the national republican congressional committee is concentrating 
on the wyoming contest with both money and manpower its leaders 
worrying that their national game plan could be undone before the 
game really gets started 
they are looking to 1990 and beyond and werent figuring on 
trouble in 1989 
but thats what theyve got 
edward j rollins cochairman of the congressional campaign 
committee took the job this year with a commitment to turn the 
trend that has kept republicans in the house minority since 1954 
rep newt gingrich of georgia the new minority whip says hell 
make that political offensive part of his daily agenda on the house 
floor 
the premise is that national aid advice and issues can in 
time reverse the republicans chronic minority status in the house 
to date the movement has been in the opposite direction after 
the 1988 elections the republicans had 176 house seats a net loss 
of three now they have 174 pending the outcome in wyoming the 
democrats have 260 
theyre sending funds and campaign help into wyoming too but 
they have kept a lower profile enabling their side to complain 
about outside influence in the republican campaign 
not that outside aid necessarily works the gop tried it in 
indiana to no avail we should not have lost that race said 
atwater thats inexcusable 
the pattern there is one that should heighten gop concerns about 
wyoming 
the indiana election was for a house seat opened when dan coats 
resigned to succeed quayle in the senate rep long had challenged 
quayle for the senate in 1986 and coats for the house in 1988 
losing by landslide margins both times she never shut down the 
house campaign 
so she was the betterknown candidate national issues 
notwithstanding she made headway by linking the republican nominee 
to two county tax increases she won by 1775 votes 
while it was a republican district that wasnt the case until 
quayle ousted a democratic congressman to launch his own political 
career in 1976 
cheney succeeded a democrat when he first won the wyoming seat 
in 1978 
like rep long in indiana democrat vinich in wyoming has 
renewed a campaign that hardly had ended when he started running 
again his was a 1988 senate race and in oneseat wyoming the 
house race is statewide too 
vinich came within 1322 votes of upsetting republican sen 
malcolm wallop last fall now he says that in the house hell be 
able to instruct the democratic majority on wyoming concerns the 
majority party has some members with senseless ideas and no 
understanding of the west he says 
atwater has said that democrats who blur the party issues can be 
tough the smartest democrats are those who create a situation so 
you cant differentiate he told a conservative group last week 
thats what happened in alabama

one after another proud symbols of 
cities and empires are disappearing from public view in italy 
victims of pollution and discouraging testimony that restoration 
cant rescue every monument and artwork 
in florence the 15thcentury gilded panels on the east entrance 
to the baptistry a door so beautiful michelangelo thought it was 
fit for paradise are destined for specially sealed glass chambers 
inside a museum 
now blackened and devoured by automobile pollution the 10 
bronze panels were done over 23 years by lorenzo ghiberti before 
his death in 1455 to depict the creation and other old testament 
stories today they are being delicately restored one by one to 
much of their shining splendor 
but since no known chemical coating can protect them from car 
exhaust the panels will be replaced in the door by copies the 
originals will end up inside the oxygenless humiditycontrolled 
chambers of the museum across from florences cathedral 
ghibertis work dear to florentine hearts has good company 
earlier this decade the four gilded bronze horses on the facade 
of st marks basilica in venice were placed after restoration 
inside the church and their places outside were taken by copies 
the statues outside milans cathedral also are going inside and 
rome will not soon see its symbol back at the city hall square atop 
capitoline hill the 1800yearold gilded bronze statue of emperor 
marcus aurelius astride his noble horse recently restored is too 
frail to withstand the pollution and vibration of romes relentless 
traffic 
restoration has had some heady days in recent years there have 
been gala unveilings of venetian canalside palaces the emergence 
of michelangelos bright colors during the cleaning of the sistine 
chapel ceiling and the titilating discovery that adam and eves fig 
leaves were a coverup added to masaccios fresco in a florence 
church 
but less attention has gone to the sobering realization that 
despite the marriage of high technology to restoration restorers 
often watch helplessly as monuments crumble and others like 
ghibertis masterpiece must be removed from their glorious 
settings to survive 
in its current state technology is more suitable to 
diagnosis than prevention of the decay said alessandra melucco 
who directed restoration of the statue 
and what do you do with a monument like the 65foothigh arch of 
settimius severus which isnt easily moved along with its 
spectacular setting in the roman forum 
in a generation we are losing an historical heritage of 2000 
years said roberto nardi an archaeologist and restorer who was 
part of a team that restored onehalf of the arch one of romes 
most badly damaged monuments 
what took 2000 years to erode then took 50 now takes five 
years 
like some other restorers nardi said its time to rethink the 
approach to restoration 
in the case of the arch restorers had to stop work because they 
ran out of money from a special fund established by parliament 
earlier this decade the restored half is more or less white while 
the untouched half is coffee brown with soot and grime 
nardi says they would have stopped anyway because they saw that 
pollution was damaging the monument as fast as they cleaned it 
in five six 10 years said fellow restorer luisa barucci 
it will be the same argument the black crust will return 
italy always waits until these things are falling apart 
restoration said nardi should be resumed only when the state 
begins a program of regular maintenance 
we stopped work but maintenance didnt begin he said 
the arch was restored with a natural material limestone 
plaster that lasts about five years the temptation is to use 
harsh plastic resins that could last longer but in some cases 
the coatings made it impossible for the stone to breathe and 
the coatings themselves were difficult to remove without damaging 
the monument 
at a recent conference in florence experts called for more 
chemical research specifically to aid restorers 
arnold wolff in charge of restoring the cathedral of cologne in 
west germany projected slides that showed how in less than a 
century the face of a stone angel was disfigured by pollution 
we desperately need a chemical agent to protect stone he 
said 
sponsored by eni italys state energy company the conference 
also discussed the role of private companies 
alitalia for example backed the cleanup of the angels on 
castel santangelo bridge across the tiber olivetti sponsored the 
cleaning of leonardo da vincis last supper a restoration now 
being criticized as too slow and perhaps faulty 
offers of private funding are difficult to dismiss in italy 
where cultural projects occupy a miniscule slice of the 
deficitridden national budjet 
but luis monreal director of the californiabased getty 
conservation institute and a speaker at the conference maintained 
that the private sector is more projectoriented and doesnt have 
an overall view 
private donors often want to work only on the most famous works 
or something that will capture public attention rather than on 
works most in need of restoration said roberto boddi an art 
conservator at florences fortezza da basso one of italys leading 
restoration centers 
adriano la regina romes superintendent of archaeology for the 
past 12 years said money is lacking for regular maintenance 
he added in an interview at his office at the forum that his 
department asked for the equivalent of about 150 million last year 
for a minimal threeyear plan of restoration and maintenance 
including the needs of museums 
parliament approved only 66 million 
nardi said his calculations indicate that it would cost about 
15000 a year to maintain a major monument in rome about the 
same cost of providing a car and driver to a deputy in parliament 
la regina said the underlying problem is not money but pollution 
we need severe laws to be implemented very quickly filters 
on cars abolition of harmful fuels and traffic bans he said

editors note the world was on the brink of a second major war 
that april half a century ago when merchants of the future put on 
display their conceptions of a marvelous tomorrow visitors to the 
1939 new york worlds fair were dazzled by what the future could 
be one fairgoer recalls but in some ways modern civilization 
didnt pan out the way they envisioned that it would

in many a dresser drawer across the country 
amid the faded snapshots and other keepsakes there rests a plastic 
pickle a souvenir of a splendiferous tomorrow that came and went 
fifty years ago in the interlude between the great depression 
and world war ii the pickles owner had gone to flushing queens 
to discover a sleek and glittering future had set up camp on 1216 
acres of reclaimed ash heap 
the visitor to the 1939 new york worlds fair came away with 
visions of televisions and superhighways of nylon stockings and 
automatic milking machines of manmade lightning and aerated bread 
all this and a pickle pin one of six million such souvenirs 
distributed at the hj heinz pavilion 
they saw wonders like the walkergordon rotolactor a revolving 
platform on which five cows were showered dried with sterile 
towels and mechanically milked they watched the 7foottall 
westinghouse robot elektro and his motodog sparko they 
toured 200 buildings each of them spectacular 175 sculptures 
and 105 murals 
everything was unfamiliar they were dazzled by what the 
future could be says barbara cohen author with steven heller 
and seymour chwast of trylon and perisphere the 1939 new york 
worlds fair 
that was the aim of the fairs organizers that and to bring 
tourist dollars to new york city the citys business elite had 
been impressed by the 1933 century of progress fair in chicago 
they proposed a fair to mark the 150th anniversary of george 
washingtons inauguration in new york 
grover a whelan former police commissioner head of a 
distillery and the bowtied barkerboss of the 1939 worlds fair 
said at the time by giving a clear and orderly interpretation of 
our own age the fair will project the average man into the world 
of tomorrow 
the symbols of the fair were two abstract shapes at once 
classical and modernistic the trylon a 610foot spike and the 
globular perisphere a theater twice the size of radio city music 
hall which was home to democracity a multimedia depiction of the 
city of the future 
radio commentator hv kaltenborn narrated the sixminute show 
as day fades into night each man seeks a home for here are 
children comfort neighbors recreation the good life of a 
wellplanned city 
the same theme was struck at the fairs most popular exhibit 
general motors futurama where 552 moving chairs carried fairgoers 
past a diorama depicting the united states circa 1960 a place 
where sevenlane radiocontrolled highways directed 
teardropshaped cars at 100 mph 
in the future the narrator said cars would be airconditioned 
he was right he said they would cost as little as 200 he was 
wrong 
the land is much greener than it was in 1939men love their 
fields and gardens better and more wisely life magazine wrote of 
futurama 
spectators often waited in line two hours to see futurama but 
there was so much to do and so little time 
they ran to the atampt building to see the voder a speech 
synthesizer and to enter the contest for a free longdistance 
call they ran to the dairy world of tomorrow to meet elsie the 
cow they ran to the dupont exhibit to witness the wonders of 
nylon lucite and cellophane and to rca to see the first regular 
broadcasts of television

the home of tomorrow was highlighted at general electric which 
offered a kitchen with appliances that talked at westinghouse 
which pitted mrs drudge who did dishes the oldfashioned way 
against mrs modern who used a dishwasher at tomorrow town a 
collection of 15 model homes 
the fair was not entirely commercial 60 nations opened 
pavilions in flushing meadows including the soviet union but 
there is no doubt that the world of tomorrow was a world of 
salesmanship 
writer eb white hoped to find the field of honor at the 
fair but found instead that it was merely heinz jousting with 
beechnut the same old contest on a somewhat larger field with 
accommodations for more spectators and somewhat better facilities 
all round 
others found fault with the fairs crowdpleasing amusement 
zone which featured a parachute jump and billy roses aquacade as 
well as more tawdry diversions like sideshows and barebreasted 
women offered of course as educational exhibits on the 
lifestyles of amazons 
the amusements took precedence in 1940 when it became clear 
that the fair was in trouble with the advent of world war ii the 
soviet pavilion and others closed the trylon and perisphere were 
in bad repair temporary structures that were not designed to 
withstand the weather 
more importantly the fair was losing money most critics argued 
that the 75cent admission fee was too high a full day at the fair 
for two people including meals cost about 7 a high tariff for 
the end of the depression 
fair officials expected 50 million visitors in 1939 attendance 
fell short of that mark after two years running the fair lost 
nearly 19 million 
this did not prevent new york from trying another worlds fair 
at the same spot 25 years later that fair too was a financial 
fiasco and it is not recalled with the same intensity and fondness 
as its predecessor 
it seemed more tawdry than the 1939 worlds fair said 
author cohen 
the people who attended the 1939 fair were not so worldwise as 
their children would be they traveled less had no television to 
bombard them with images of an unobtainable good life had never 
eaten food of foreign lands 
it was a simpler time truly cohen says 
cohen operates an antique bookstore for new york topics the 
children and grandchildren of fairgoers visit her shop and buy 
trylon and perisphere ringtoss sets ashtrays bookends pennants 
doilies postcards license plates as well as pins that say i 
have seen the future 
why do people who were not alive when a fair blossomed in 
flushing seek out these mementos its a gene memory she says 
one souvenir remains buried at flushing meadows a time capsule 
containing bits of 1930s life so that people who lived in the 
future foretold by the fair could know a bit more about the past 
denizens of the future will find sheet music to flat foot 
floogie a mickey mouse cup newsreel footage including the film 
of jesse owens triumph in the 100meter dash at the 1936 olympics 
nine new york daily newspapers among them the daily worker the 
book gone with the wind 
but the ultimate testimony to the optimism of a time and place 
before hiroshima before fears of environmental catastrophe before 
auschwitz comes in the instructions engraved on a plaque above the 
time capsule 
do not open until the year 6939

editors note they are the johnny appleseeds of the 80s 
scattering vegetable and flower seeds across the land to help feed 
the poor brighten the lives of the sick and handicapped operating 
from cramped quarters in an old office building in washington the 
america the beautiful fund has found a way to produce millions of 
dollars worth of food at minimal expense

a reporters telephone call interrupted otis 
butlers breakfast he had been eating a tomato out of his freezer 
hed grown it himself in a garden carved out of a vacant lot 
in the bronx 
otis butler is a retired baker and president of the union 
prospect area block association but when he talks tomatoes he 
sounds like a farmer 
we need rain he says we had six weeks of hot weather 
last summer hot and dry it knocked our tomatoes down we didnt 
even enter the 58th street horticulture fair but when i saw 
tomatoes that won prizes i said what the heck our tomatoes are as 
good as these we could have won a prize 
nobody had real good tomatoes last summer 
an unlikely midmorning conversation an unlikely farmer talking 
about crops grown from seeds from an unlikely place the 
seedjammed office of the america the beautiful fund in an aging 
office building a few blocks from the white house 
it may be the only office in washington in which the top drawer 
of a green file cabinet is labeled prairie grass the middle 
drawer is labeled bulk flowers and muskmelon the bottom drawer 
is labeled corn beans pea packets 
from these shoebox quarters and operating on a shoestring the 
fund distributes donated vegetable herb and flower seeds and bulbs 
to local projects across america 
america the beautiful fund turns out to be four parttime 
workers a handful of volunteers and a fulltime staff of three 
wildlife biologist paul bruce dowling founder and executive 
director former actress nanine bilski national projects director 
and anthropologist nat thomas who spends much of his time packing 
envelopes with seed packets 
they are johnny appleseeds with a computer and a far broader 
list of seeds to give away they figure their operation green 
plant reaches into one county in 10 maybe even one in three 
the idea is simplicity itself persuade a dozen of the nations 
seed companies to donate rather than destroy last years 
seeds on the promise they will go only to people who would not be 
in a position to buy them at the corner hardware store 
persuade apa transport and other trucking companies to bring in 
the seeds at no charge persuade local poverty agencies 4h clubs 
church groups neighborhood associations refugee centers drug 
rehabilitation centers county health departments soup kitchens 
nursing homes even hospices for aids patients to start a 
gardening project charge them only the cost of shipping the seeds 
50 cents a pound 
for 12 in shipping fees a group could get enough seed to grow 
two acres of tomatoes and one acre each of corn lettuce 
cucumbers green peppers and squash 
the idea started in 1980 with 60 beautification projects it 
took off when the new environmental ethic matched up with the 
nations dawning awareness that there was hunger on the street 
corners in the small towns and even on the farms of this 
prosperous fertile and sometimes overfed land 
last season 15000 groups asked for received and distributed 
500000 packets of seeds and 50000 pounds of bulk seeds 
thats enough dowling estimates to provide over 70 million 
pounds of fresh nutritious food grown by and for hungry people at 
the cost of a penny a pound 
it is an idea so simple and so basic that it works he says 
the value of the food grown last year by dowlings 
seatofthepants estimate is 20 million 
this year those figures will double dowling and ms bilski 
confidently predict they should know much of the seeds for this 
springs planting already have been shipped

most seeds go to the rural poor but many go to innercity 
projects such as otis butlers in the bronx one of hundreds in the 
new york city metropolitan area 
butler says 18 adults and a handful of kids raised enough food 
to feed themselves and 30 other families so successful has the 
project been that participants had to buy freezers to store up what 
couldnt be eaten fresh including of course otis breakfast 
tomato 
theres a little work attached to it he says but when 
you look at what youve grown oh god 
says ms bilski do you know that chinese proverb give a man 
a fish and hell eat for a day teach him to fish and hell eat for 
a lifetime 
dowling moneys not appreciated the way seeds are seeds are 
a chance to do something for oneself a chance to put gods own 
magic to work 
ms bilski we got word about what happened when we sent 
paperwhite narcissus bulbs to a project for aids patients the 
doctors told us about one man who had been antisocial all his 
life then he grew some paperwhites and brought them around to the 
bedsides of other patients it gave them joy and it gave him joy a 
doctor said maybe this was the one positive thing he was waiting to 
do before he died 
dowling if we could figure out how to put growing plants into 
the drug culture maybe they could be part of the solution 
operation green plant operates with a minimum of that 
washington perennial red tape a onepage flyer headlined free 
seeds is sent to all who ask all who america the beautiful think 
might be interested 
we are offering between 50 and 750 packets for the projects of 
local groups on the basis of availability and relative need for 
volunteer work in growing food for the needy growing plants for 
charitable plant sales to beautify neighborhoods grow plants for 
the elderly the handicapped and the confined start new 
educational programs to show that growing plants can give people 
and communities new hope as they help to beautify and nourish 
america the flyer says 
america the beautiful operates on a budget of about 250000 in 
contributions from people and foundations if dowlings 
calculations are correct it means every donated dollar yields 280 
pounds of food 
enough money has been hard to come by dowling says he sent out 
appeals to foundations this winter for the 150000 that would be 
required to enlarge the operations bulk seed warehouse in lorton 
va making possible a vast expansion of the program but got no 
takers 
foundations are hard to convert he says theyre in the habit 
of funding more sophisticated proposals than one that merely calls 
for sending seeds to people 
dowling says 50 packets of seeds will be sent no questions 
asked to any organization that promises to distribute them 
projects seeking more are asked to first tell how the seeds are to 
be used 
if they write a letter he says thats good enough for 
us 
what goes back is a seed grant in the fullest sense of that 
term

editors note the poet john keats called oxford the finest 
city in the world but despite its manifest wealth of 
architecture and the riches of its libraries oxford university is 
caught in a funding squeeze that has forced it to go hatinhand 
looking for money proud oxford is learning a lesson in humility 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
for the fourth week of hilary term the 
sunday sermon at the university church of st mary the virgin was 
on the grace of humility 
humility has been preached to oxford since 1684 under a pious 
bequest though it is not so easily learned to call a man an 
oxford man the 19thcentury prime minister we gladstone said 
is to pay him the highest compliment that can be paid to a human 
being 
in recent years however oxford has been learning daily 
practical lessons on the humility of reduced circumstances 
for the first time in 442 years there is no regius professor of 
greek the university said it couldnt afford to hire one nor a 
regius professor of ecclesiastical history 
there are 140 vacant teaching positions at oxford and members of 
the association of university teachers upset at not getting raises 
this year are refusing to participate in final examinations 
the oxford playhouse closed for lack of funds in 1987 the 
bodleian library is looking for 172000 to buy acidfree cardboard 
boxes to store rare books and the oxford union where generations 
of politicians have polished their sneers and ripostes had to be 
bailed out by a japanese donation 
just as oscar wilde as an oxford undergraduate found it 
harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china so the 
university finds it increasingly difficult to live up to its 
reputation now it has gone hatinhand to its fiercely 
independent colleges to wealthy corporations and alumni 
the university now is not filling five out of six vacancies 
says henry drucker an american academic who directs the university 
development offices campaign to raise about 385 million within 
five years the goal includes 70 million for an endowment 
we are not in any way replacing our stock of old people who 
are all getting fed up and cheesed off says rosemary fennell 
secretary of the oxford chapter of the teachers association which 
represents about onethird of the faculty 
throughout the university system the number of faculty members 
under the age of 35 has fallen from 29 percent to 15 percent in the 
last decade 
education is undervalued in this society ms fennell says 
i think the government has some responsibility for the 
longterm fabric of society to insure that you have a 
welleducated citizenry and that you are doing the primary 
research and whos going to fund sanskrit 
despite its manifest wealth of architecture and the riches of 
its libraries oxford shares in a funding squeeze which affects all 
of britains university system the number of students nationwide 
has dipped 3 percent since 1982 and the institutions project a 
combined fiveyear deficit of 128 million by 1992 
oxford has begun giving merit raises of up to 30 percent for 
outstanding teachers but cambridge university believes it can keep 
its best and brightest on annual salaries averaging about 47600 
cambridge is attempting to cut its faculty by 5 percent 
oxford has the distinction of educating the architects of this 
new era prime minister margaret thatcher and education secretary 
kenneth baker who envisions marketled multifunded higher 
education 
in practical terms that means a greater dependence on private 
support loans instead of grants for students and even talk about 
privatizing the universities 
symptoms of distress are hidden and oxford remains to the 
visitor what the poet john keats called the finest city in the 
world 
the days of peaches cream and champagne have not ended they 
are dished out every year to heads of houses and other nobs as the 
benefaction of lord crewe a 17thcentury bishop 
birdsong and the distant tolling of bells still soothe the 
wanderer beyond christ church meadow which commands an 
unobstructed view of the dreaming spires celebrated by matthew 
arnold though the whine of traffic on the high street may shatter 
a reverie even there

black tie is still required for men and gowns for the women who 
debate at the oxford union though their audience is mostly swathed 
in denim and leather behind the imposing walls and fences which 
keep outsiders in their place the lawns and flower beds are 
immaculate and increasing numbers of students want in applications 
rose 10 percent last year and 21 percent the year before 
oxfords facade is one of unassailable immortality a place 
where new college is 620 years old but change is constant even in 
the building stones that replace those worn down by corrosive rain 
just this year the university enacted a sexual harassment code 
putting undergraduates offlimits from the occasional wayward don 
keble college became the last college to ban sconcing a 
traditional drinking challenge which involved gulping a quart of 
beer at one go and after eight centuries the university has 
gotten around to publishing an alumni magazine emanating from the 
same development office that shortly will be soliciting funds from 
140000 living graduates 
it also promised to stop using the word alumni after being 
scolded by two grads for adopting that appalling american 
expression for the distinguished crowd that includes 24 prime 
ministers and as many winners of nobel prizes charles and john 
wesley the founders of methodism cardinal john henry newman 
christopher wren the architect of st pauls cathedral literary 
lights including samuel johnson graham greene ts eliot and 
william golding and roger bannister the first fourminute miler 
now sir roger and warden of oxfords pembroke college 
it was the oxfordcambridge tradition and style of learning that 
harvard university set out to mimic now oxford is trying to copy 
harvards financial savvy 
harvard has an endowment of 4 billion drucker says we 
have an endowment of 138 million which puts us ahead in the 
uk but 138 million is nothing 
drucker thinks the university needs to do hardheaded things such 
as copyrighting its emblem and collecting royalties from tshirts 
harvard earns more than 100000 a year from licensing its emblem 
in japan 
felicity spector president of the oxford university student 
union worries about the funding appeals implications for other 
british universities 
if the government expects other universities and polytechnics 
to do the same they dont have oxfords contacts and wont be 
able to raise as much she says 
we are at the moment an intellectually elite university i 
dont see anything wrong with that except i dont like it that the 
intellectual elite command the greatest resources 
the fund drive has already brought a 35 million pledge from 
squibb the pharmaceutical giant for neuroscientific research 
105 million from gd searle and co for glycobiology research 
and an anonymous pledge of funds to hire a regius professor of 
greek 
while the university is raising money the colleges are looking 
out for themselves somerville one of the two remaining womenonly 
colleges recently celebrated raising its endowment fund to 35 
million and is naming its new buildings for its famous graduate 
mrs thatcher 
the oxford union was in danger of dissolving under a sixfigure 
overdraft until the mitsubishi trust last year pledged 172 
million over four years 
union president adam bruce says that will provide for the 
replacement of peeling wallpaper in the debating hall the 
threadbare carpets in its common rooms and restore the skylight 
over the billiard tables 
annoyance at the government unites large segments of the oxford 
union the more proletarian student union and the faculty which in 
1985 took the unprecedented step of denying mrs thatcher an 
honorary degree 
there hasnt been a motion in the years i have been here that 
was progovernment and has passed bruce says

professor archie campbell peers into 
the future and sees fish a thousand tons of the seas bounty 
heaped high on a magic cart gliding effortlessly above the floor 
campbell is joking but he and his colleagues in the new 
research center in superconductivity are well aware that the 
british government expects some practical patentable return on its 
investment 
we are in a bit of a glass house to see whether we can produce 
something of interest to the public and commercial firms in 
particular says peter duncumb the centers director i think 
thats all to the good 
cambridge university whose scientific tradition stretches from 
sir isaac newton to stephen hawking author of the contemporary 
best seller a brief history of time seems the obvious choice 
for the governments first venture in interdisciplinary research 
centers 
appropriately the center is in the new building of the 
cavendish laboratory famous for its pioneering work in splitting 
the atom in the 1930s 
superconductors have zeroresistance to electric currents and 
defy gravity by repelling a magnetic field but they now work only 
at the temperature of liquid nitrogen about minus 390 degress f 
which limits their potential 
the elusive roomtemperature superconductor conjures up visions 
of 2000mph trains smaller and faster computers electromagnetic 
launchers to replace rockets visions too of bags and bags of 
profits 
the center is the first of nine interdisciplinary research 
centers established by the government with an initial commitment 
of 93 million for six years 
were wellfunded campbell says carefully by british 
standards 
the us government spends about 90 million a year on 
superconductivity research and a white house advisory committee 
proposes spending 30 million more 
cambridge is sometimes thought of as the scientific half of 
oxbridge as britains two oldest and greatest universities are 
often called but oxford 70 miles to the southwest is also 
getting an interdisciplinary research center in molecular 
sciences and cambridges literary heritage includes milton 
marlowe wordsworth and dryden 
government grant reductions which led to oxfords public appeal 
for funds have also been felt in the cavendish laboratory 
we have good people so we can get research grants from the 
research councils but the difficulty today is that the backup in 
the case of laboratory space technician support and general 
running costs is no longer adequate says john deakin secretary 
to the department of physics and the cavendish laboratory 
technicians he says have been lost to betterpaid jobs in 
private industry in the cambridge science park ironically the 
park is run by trinity college and plows part of its profits back 
into the university 
denis noble professor of cardiovascular physiology at oxford 
and founder of the lobbying group save british science says that 
funding is an old problem 
he cites the case of charles babbage a cambridge experimenter 
in mechanical calculators who lost his government funding in 1842 
the mind boggles to think that britain might have had an ibm 
in the 19th century nobler says we could have had a world 
lead in that area

oxford england ap applicants need not be incredibly clever 
to be admitted oxford university says but the old school tie 
still helps 
everyone who is accepted has a reasonable standard of 
intelligence a very small minority is brilliant says the 
catalog which also notes that an iq of 130 is considered just 
average on the campus 
oxford admits about 3000 freshers every year selected from 
about 10000 applicants about half of those who apply and half of 
those admitted are from expensive public schools such as eton 
rugby or winchester says ted baskerville admissions officer at 
the university 
about 7 percent of british schoolchildren attend public schools 
although the figure jumps to nearly 20 percent after age 16 when 
many students leave statefunded schools 
only in 1981 did the proportion of state schoolers top 50 
percent at oxford 
oxbridge as oxford and and its sister university cambridge are 
collectively known has always been the express lane to power for 
instance 14 of the 22 members of the cabinet including prime 
minister margaret thatcher are oxbridge graduates 
students apply for admission to a college though they will 
receive their degrees from the university 
many students receive grants from local governments to cover 
fees of about 7400 a year and no one need be kept out by 
shortage of funds says baskerville 
americans and other foreign arts students pay an additional 
5390 a year in science the extra charge is 7368

editors note in its 85 years the carnegie hero fund 
commission has rewarded about 7300 men women and children for 
heroism out of 63000 who were nominated what makes a hero the

award are hard pressed to explain what prompted their actions

when petite gail mazzetti hooks spotted two 
thugs beating a houston police officer and going for his gun she 
attacked with uncharacteristic fury scratching kicking and 
punching until the two men fled 
i thought they were going to kill him recalls hooks a 
waitress who had been watching the events from inside a restaurant 
he had the prettiest face but he was purple i kept thinking 
that could be my brother 
hooks ran after one of the bad guys until reality caught up with 
heroism on that warm humid evening of april 20 1986 in a back 
alley alone and shaking she abandoned the chase threw up in the 
bushes and hurried home to bed 
nevertheless the carnegie hero fund commission proclaimed her a 
hero and a forevergrateful officer james whitley sent flowers 
hooks is one of 7313 men women and children who have been 
honored by the commission since its founding in 1904 by 
industrialist andrew carnegie who was moved by the bravery 
displayed following a mine explosion near pittsburgh 
carnegie heroes receive 2500 and a bronze medal on which is 
inscribed the new testament verse greater love hath no man than 
this that a man lay down his life for his friends 
for the selfeffacing hooks who moved out of texas shortly 
after the fracas because one of the attackers remained at large 
the term hero is one she is uncomfortable with 
that was the way i was brought up said hooks now 31 and 
living in charlotte nc if you saw someone who needed help you 
just helped them you dont think about it you just do it 
to whitley however hooks and another waitress who came to his 
rescue deserve the title 
i couldnt believe they tried to help me like that when they 
could have easily gotten killed or hurt recalls whitley 28 who 
is still on the houston police force 
i probably wouldnt be here today if not for them 
in establishing the fund which he endowed with 5 million 
carnegie said he wasnt trying to create heroismknowing well 
that heroic action is impulsive 
he also said he wanted to make sure heroes or their survivors 
dont suffer pecuniarily as a result of their deeds 
paying for pensions scholarship money and funeral expenses is 
where carnegie has its real punch says commission spokesman 
walter rutkowski 
in 85 years more than 63000 people have been nominated for 
heroism awards only 7313 or about 11 percent were chosen to 
receive them 
we are up to our whatever in nominees says rutkowski whose 
office in downtown pittsburgh is watched over by a somber portrait 
of carnegie we give away as many awards as we have cases that 
meet our requirements 
nominees are scrutinized by three investigators before they are 
voted on by the commissions 21member executive committee 
like dragnets joe friday investigators want to know just 
the facts 
in a drowning case we go for the water temperature the 
distance of the swim the current and the rescuers swimming 
ability rutkowski says we dont get into a persons psyche 
you can not get emotionally tied up with these cases you just 
dont have the capacity to see these cases other than clinically 
its like a doctor in the operating room you dont want him to 
weep over the pain youre in 
candidates are excluded from consideration if they are obligated 
to act because of their occupation such as lifeguard or 
firefighter a person who saves a family member also is excluded 
unless the rescuer is severely injured or killed 
above all the victim must be in imminent danger of losing his 
life and the hero must risk his life in performing the rescue 
which must take place in the united states or canada 
more than 1500 carnegie heroes or roughly 21 percent died 
performing their rescues the most common of which involve 
drownings or fires

surprisingly perhaps a candidate isnt excluded if he fails to 
save a persons life 
it may sound crass but were not interested in the victim so 
much as the rescuer rutkowski says were not a lifesaving 
award we give awards to those who risk their own lives to save 
others 
heroes range in age from 8 to 80 and 91 percent are male 
most are modest and hard pressed to explain what prompted their 
actions the investigators say 
i dont think anyone can truthfully claim to understand why 
anyone stands by or gets involved says marlin ross a carnegie 
investigator since 1983 
carnegie hero robert jameson says the act of heroism is 
instinctual 
if you dont react immediately youre going to be overwhelmed 
by what happens youll just freeze says jameson 36 of 
roebling nj who last april saved a woman from a knifewielding 
attacker 
it has nothing to do with bravery says andrew mathieson 
60 of pittsburgh who was shot three times while defending his 
secretary jane celender from a gunman on feb 19 1986 
if you ask if i would attack a 210pound man holding a gun i 
would say no not consciously but if the circumstances would 
develop the same way again i would probably do the same thing 
he says i think the real brave people are those who have time to 
consider what theyre going to do and still do it 
mary ann anderson whose father john died trying to save a boy 
from drowning in lake michigan on july 17 1987 says shes met 
several carnegie heroes and all share one trait 
they all have this fundamental concern for people that what 
you do in life does matter and affect others says miss anderson 
24 of baldwin mich 
everyone wants to believe the best of them will come out but 
no one knows what you are going to do in a situation like that you 
either panic or you do something its your inner soul taking 
over 
andersons death left not only an emotional void in his familys 
life but also a financial one his three children were in college 
at the time and there was little money to pay the bills 
the carnegie commission stepped in paying the funeral expenses 
setting up a monthly stipend for andersons wife louise and 
contributing scholarship money 
it was a blessing said mrs anderson 42 a schoolteacher 
in baldwin there were many bleak times when i didnt know if i 
was going to be able to make the bills 
of the 105 beneficiaries currently receiving pensions evelyn 
sponsler of everett pa has been on the books the longest 
for 58 years mrs sponsler and her disabled daughter have lived 
exclusively on a carnegie pension awarded when her husband 
clarence died trying to rescue a man who was overcome by fumes 
when he fell into a gasoline storage tank 
i probably would have had to live on welfare without it 
says mrs sponsler 82 who had three young children to raise when 
her husband died 
last year the commission gave out 236000 in pensions about 
372000 went toward the 2500 hero awards funeral expenses and 
to 20 scholarship recipients 
what heroes often do not receive is praise from the person whose 
lives theyve saved say commission investigators 
jameson says the woman he saved never thanked him but he can 
understand why 
this was a very violent thing that happened to her he says 
she just wants to put it in her past and forget about it 
jane celender 42 the pittsburgh secretary who owes her life to 
mathiesons quick actions says thanks seem inadequate 
how can you say thank you for your life she asks

editors note they were called the aces a group of fulltime 
bridge players recruited by a texas businessman who wanted america 
to be the best that was 20 years ago and nobody then could have 
guessed what a lasting influence they would have on the game 
</TEXT>

americas top names in bridge credit their success 
at cards to a wealthy texans play for pay offer two decades 
ago 
dallas businessman ira corn himself a bridge player got tired 
of italy dominating the world bridge championships so in 1968 he 
dealt himself a winning hand 
corn recruited a handful of players bobby wolff jim jacoby 
mike lawrence bobby goldman and billy eisenberg and offered them 
modest pay if they would come to dallas and work full time at 
playing bridge and honing their games 
i joined them a year later says bob hamman now 50 and the 
worlds no 1ranked player wed play a lot of tournaments a 
computer would deal certain hands so we could practice the type 
hands we needed work on 
corn dubbed his recruits the aces they were required to go 
through a training regimen as if they were professional athletes 
it was approached in that fashion as a matter of fact like 
an athletic team hamman says the pay wasnt great i believe 
single guys got 800 a month and the married guys got 1000 but 
it wasnt bad at all 
it was great experience all against topechelon players i 
thought it was terrific getting paid to do something i liked so 
well 
a secretary recorded every play they made in their practice 
sessions and the spotlight was beamed on good plays and bad alike 
in 1970 the aces brought the united states its first world 
bridge championship since 1959 they repeated in 1971 
in very short order in respect to american competition we 
became professionals against amateurs hamman says 
then in 1971 the aces broke up and it was back to the 
pack hamman says 
but corns project had a lasting influence on the quality of 
us bridge 
thats evident if you look at the record of the players on the 
team since it broke up hamman says every player became a 
rocksolid player and became tougher mentally 
since the formation of the aces in 1968 the united states sent 
a team to the world championship only once without at least one 
member of the aces on it 
jacoby says the standard of bridge also was improved by a wealth 
of literature about the game much of it written by aces members or 
influenced by their innovations 
jacoby who is a stock broker in dallas and wolff write 
syndicated bridge columns that appear daily in newspapers 
throughout the united states wolff and hamman tried unsuccessfully 
to market a computer software program that bridge players could use 
to improve their play they couldnt come up with anything that 
could meet their standards 
lawrence who now lives in berkeley calif was recognized as 
the bridge author of the 70s and 80s and a recent survey listed 
him as the no 1 bridge author today he has written 12 books on 
various aspects of bidding play and defense 
lawrence also is regarded as one of the foremost instructors 
traveling across the country to hold weeklong seminars for classes 
of 25 or more bridge players 
i certainly would be the first to credit ira corn for the fact 
that i am a bridge author at all or that i ever began teaching 
classes lawrence says 
in 1969 after lawrence had been with the aces for a year corn 
told them he was contemplating writing a bridge column and asked 
each of them to write five practice bridge columns he liked 
lawrences easy conversational style of writing and called him in

he told me i wrote very well but that instead of a column he 
wanted me to write a book lawrence says a month later he 
said michael you are going to give a series of bridge classes in 
five weeks here are the students who will be in your class and 
this is where you are to go i was literally terrified but he 
made me do it 
from the first book and the first classes came other books and 
other classes 
last october lawrence began a monthly newsletter the first 
major venture of its kind in bridge 
i am attempting to combine about 80 percent judgment with 20 
percent system lawrence says hopefully i will find the right 
combination 
when the aces were formed there were probably no more than 20 
bridge books of acceptable tournament standard lawrence says 
now there are probably 500 
the american contract bridge league the governing body for 
tournament bridge play has made a major push to bring new players 
into the game as evidenced by a growing number of tournament 
events in which novices may play only against other novices 
the game is still dominated at the higher levels by the big 
names of a decade ago few new impact bridge professionals have 
emerged 
bridge players are getting better without doubt but the same 
plyers are still the dominant players lawrence says im not 
really sure why that is 
some believe its because theres little financial reward in 
bridge such as awaits those who excel in some other competitions 
hamman and wolff both of whom still live in dallas are ranked 
individually as the no 1 and 2 players in the world and together 
are regarded as the top partnership in the world 
they were part of teams that won four world bridge championships 
over the past 10 years 
in october they teamed with jacoby jeff meckstroth eric 
rodwell and seymon deutsch to emerge no 1 from a field of more 
than 50 teams in venice to give the united states the only world 
championship that had eluded it the world mens team olympiad 
deutsch a laredo texas businessman and the only member of the 
sixman us team who never before had won a world championship 
was ecstatic 
its fantastic its unreal he says its the thrill of a 
lifetime 
some bridge professionals are on the tournament trail virtually 
every week of the year but unlike sports such as tennis and golf 
80 percent to 90 percent of the tournament field is made up of 
ordinary bridge players of varying levels of expertise 
a trophy is awarded to the player who wins the most matchpoints 
each year neither hamman nor wolff has ever come close to winning 
it 
if you go after it it pretty well is a fulltime venture 
hamman says i play a lot of tournaments but not 40 a year 
which is pretty well what youd have to play it gets to be quite a 
grind going to boise idaho one week and then to butte mont 
and then to chicago 
still hamman concedes that if thousands of dollars in prize 
money were at stake that would be different he would be in 
the hunt 
some financial reward is available at every tournament some 
players pay professionals 400 to 500 a day to be their partners 
for various twosession events about seven hours of play 
for the first time in years jacoby traveled the tournament 
circuit last year playing sometimes with other pros and sometimes 
with paying clients he emerged as an easy victor in the 1988 
matchpoint chase 
jacoby says he made a determined run for the title because his 
father the late oswald jacoby won the title years ago the 
jacobys are the only fatherson combination to have won the trophy

editors note the infamous long island garbage barge and the 
philadelphia freighter filled with ash drew attention to the 
nations growing trash problem as they sailed the seas in vain 
looking for a place to dump their unwanted cargo but small town 
america is also feeling the pinch as landfills continue to fill up 
heres what has happened in one new york town where a special 
police detail is on guard against illegal dumping 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
sanitation workers tore into a plastic 
garbage bag searching for clues the giveaway could have been a 
receipt a letter 
in the end an unopened envelope from a mailorder publishing 
contest was the telltale evidence needed to trace the smelly bag 
back to its source 
a police officer who follows the local garbage truck as part of 
the new garbage detail tracked down the culprit one of the many 
people since january whove had to be told they were mishandling 
their garbage about 20 have been actually arrested and fined for 
violating city codes on trash disposal 
garbage and how to throw it away has taken on a whole new 
meaning for the 7900 residents of this city since the county 
landfill was closed last fall for pollution violations 
people in columbia county dont simply drag the weekly trash to 
the curb anymore garbage disposal takes thought and time and money 
city residents must place 2 stickers on their garbage bags or 
else it wont be picked up thats because the county has to come 
up with an estimated 6 million to handle the costs of shipping its 
trash elsewhere 
hudson residents who consistently refuse to use the stickers can 
be assessed a 15 service charge plus a 5 charge per bag which 
is placed on their quarterly city water and sewer bills 
but even the sticker system isnt foolproof 
when the program began in december there were some complaints 
of sticker stealing then the stickers didnt stick well in cold 
weather and more than one resident has been seen chasing after an 
airborne sticker on a cold and windy day now the county is 
considering giving up the stickers and selling garbage bags instead 
its difficult it really is says paulette riegel standing 
behind the counter of her furniture and craft store you never 
knew garbage was worth so much 
my animals love it because they are getting more scraps from 
the table than ever adds riegel who seems to be taking the new 
regulations in stride at least one customer had already ordered a 
special wooden garbage bin with different sections for recycling 
which soon will become mandatory countywide 
down the main street another store owner said she called the 
county to ask how to best dispose of hundreds of cardboard boxes 
from shipments to her store because cardboard recycling hadnt yet 
been implemented she was told to cut the boxes up into little 
pieces place them in garbage bags and put them at the curb with 
the mandatory sticker on the bag 
the boxes remained at the store until she gave them to a 
community group 
other people havent been that conscientious 
some folks just wouldnt adhere to the new rules at first 
prompting the special police garbage enforcement team 
people who reside outside the city were bringing their garbage 
into the city and dumping it in the alleys says police chief 
james dolan jr on the up side he says compliance is improving 
reaction from residents has been a very mixed bag says 
county board of supervisors chairman francis blake 
liquor store owner julie goldweitz says the recycling and 
sticker program is a pain in the neck but other than that it 
makes perfect sense to me were doing what we should have been 
doing for years if thats the real cost of us living here on this 
planet then we have to pay for it 
the rest of new york state and the nation might do well to 
learn from the misfortune of columbia county if they arent 
already in the throes of garbage disposal problems government and 
industry officials say 
it is not unusual in these times for counties or 
municipalities in the east especially to find themselves with 
no disposal alternative says joe salimondo editor of waste age 
magazine in washington dc 
some big cities have already run out of landfill space and now 
export their garbage at a very high cost he says 
the infamous long island garbage barge which spent eight weeks 
at sea in 1987 and was rejected by several states and three 
countries was a prime example of garbage with no place to go 
philadelphia had a similar experience with a freighter that was 
laden with 14000 tons of ash that sailed the seas for two years 
it was rejected by at least 11 countries and eventually turned up 
empty in singapore after changing names and owners 
the worst situation for waste disposal is in the northeastern 
part of the united states because of the population density and the 
lack of availability of disposal sites says ross patten vice 
president of browningferris industries a national waste disposal 
company based in houston other parts of the country are not as 
acutely affected other than california 
columbia county should serve as a warning to a lot of other 
communities who havent taken affirmative action toward resolving 
their solid waste problems says rw groneman a spokesman for 
the state department of environmental conservation 
in new york where 20 million tons of garbage are produced 
annually the state has implemented tough new standards on 
landfills and has a set a goal of reducing or recycling 50 percent 
of the waste stream by the mid1990s 
a number of new york communities are building new landfills 
composting leaves implementing recycling and requiring use of 
special garbage bags to raise revenue for increased garbage 
disposal costs 
unfortunately columbia countys problem was a political 
football and nothing was done until the issue reached crisis 
proportions 
the landfills that we as a nation have built over the years 
are filling up salimondo says but the public reaction to 
landfills thanks to the whole earth movement of the last 18 years 
have made people aware that they dont want a landfill in their 
back yard

tom bosley who stars in nbcs father 
dowling mysteries probably looks more comfortable in a clerical 
collar than any actor since pat obrien even if his st 
christophers medal does have a star of david on one side 
the suggestion prompts a slight smile and an arching of his 
thick eyebrows pat obrien played my uncle on happy days he 
says 
the smile becomes a laugh as bosley expands on his own ethic 
background 
my greatgrandfather was chief orthodox rabbi of chicago he 
says but i lived near a catholic church and had a friend who 
sang in the choir i was a boy soprano and even though i was 
jewish id go over and rehearse and sometimes sing with the choir 
my wife is catholic she corrects me if i do something wrong 
as father dowling when we did the pilot she gave me a medal with 
st christopher on one side and the star of david on the other 
bosley stars as a crimesolving chicago priest in the nbc 
series adapted from the novels by ralph mcinerny the onehour 
series has just completed its spring tryout it gave nbc its best 
ratings in three years during its friday night time period 
father dowling mysteries is expected to return in the fall 
although the final decision depends on how well other tryout series 
do 
the show also stars tracy nelson as sister steve a former 
street kid who is his savvy contact with more worldly sources and 
mary wickes as marie the rectory housekeeper 
bosley was contacted about the role while he was still playing 
sheriff amos tupper on cbs murder she wrote 
producers fred silverman and dean hargrove originally considered 
the older father brown book series but those stories turned 
out to be too sophisticated to adapt for television 
they contacted me five years ago during the first year of 
murder she wrote bosley says fred had this idea for me and 
gave me a volume of father brown to read on location in mendocino 
and during a later vacation in europe i must say the idea for 
tracy nelson was my idea i felt we needed someone to give the show 
a youthful balance 
at the same time shes his guide to the street world just as 
hes hers for the world inside the church someday we hope to do a 
back story of how she came into the sisterhood 
bosley got his first chance to test the waters as a priest in a 
perry mason movie in may 1986 michele greene starred as a nun 
who was accused of murdering a young priest she reputedly was 
romantically involved with bosley played father deleon 
they wrote the part for me after the original script was 
finished he says i was the priest who was always reading 
sherlock holmes michele greene was considered for the part of 
sister steve but shed already done a pilot called la law 
bosley says he adapted a few things about father dowling to suit 
himself 
he was probably a man who wanted to be a policeman and flunked 
the physical he says he always had a penchant for solving 
crimes he incurs the wrath of the bishop quite often hes naive 
to the ways of the world he doesnt drive he never has any money 
in his pocket someone else always has to pay for the cab 
the bishop is always after him because his church is behind on 
donations he has to ask people for money and gets it in ways that 
are unusual hell talk to someone about a crime and theyll want 
to give him a donation they havent got time for him 
the twohour pilot was filmed in chicago but the series 
episodes were made in denver silverman and hargrove also film 
perry mason there as a result bosley and debbie reynolds 
guest star in a recent perry mason movie had a reunion 
we kept passing each other in the lobby of the hotel where we 
were staying he says bosley played her brother in the debbie 
reynolds show in 196970 
that show came on eight weeks before the end of cigarette 
advertising her public relations man sent a telegram saying she 
wouldnt work because the show had a cigarette sponsor that killed 
the show 
the thing i remember most is that my dear mother who was then 
in her late 70s and living in chicago saw a headline that said 
debbies show goes up in smoke she was at a stage where she only 
read headlines she called and asked if anyone was hurt in the 
fire 
father dowling is the ninth series for bosley who also won 
a tony for his title role in fiorello in 1959 he remained 
active on the new york stage until the mid1960s when he became a 
part of the repertory company for nbcs that was the week that 
was 
next came the debbie reynolds show followed by the dean 
martin show the sandy duncan show wait till your father 
comes home he was the voice of the father on this cartoon show 
happy days thats hollywood as narrator and murder

steve ross performs the music of cole porter and 
noel coward with a wit style and sophistication that those two 
masters of song would appreciate 
most nights youll find him behind the piano at lomnibus de 
maxims the madison avenue watering hole modeled after its famous 
paris namesake 
maxims with its elegant charm is the perfect setting for 
someone who plays and sings the songs of not only porter and coward 
but other musical geniuses such as gershwin rodgers and hart 
arlen kern and sondheim too 
with his slickbacked hair and impeccable tailoring ross evokes 
another era a time when men dressed for dinner wore tuxedos to 
opening night at the opera drank martinis instead of mineral water 
and had seen every hit broadway musical at least twice 
ross has been a part of the new york cabaret scene since the 
late 60s when he arrived from washington dc but his love of 
music particularly popular music started much earlier as a 
child ross remembers listening to beatrice kay who sang songs of 
the gay 90s oldfashioned ditties like heaven will protect the 
working girl and shes only a bird in a gilded cage 
they were real numbers ross recalls the seeds were being 
planted even back then for that kind of vaudeville performing the 
cabaret stuff that performers do now is really an outgrowth of what 
vaudeville was theres the idea of building a number or getting to 
an ending 
it was one of those types of numbers dont go in the lions 
cage tonight which became the first song ross sang in public 
warbling in what he calls his cracked baritone voice 
roberta flack was a big influence he recalls at the 
time she was a piano and singing teacher and worked a little club 
on capitol hill 
i would go there for brunch get mildly high on bloody marys 
and she would come on and break our hearts he recalls every 
once in a while she would invite me up to sing and i would do 
dont go in the lions cage tonight 
before the rock era took over ross dabbled in classical music 
and played in little dance bands in the washington area but then 
manhattan beckoned and ross didnt say no to jobs in small clubs 
in new york and teaching voice to students it wasnt easy 
i didnt start out at the ritz he says ive worked in 
some places that are now video stores 
at first he didnt sing but when he discovered nightspots were 
more eager to hire a singer than just a piano player he would 
i started singing funny little songs patter songs he says 
so i started taking lessons and still do to keep me on the 
straight and narrow 
even then he was carefully cultivating his image as urban 
sophisticate 
i always wore my little tie and i always sang cole porter 
songs ross says people said keep doing that and 
fortunately that kind of music came around again i didnt know 
anything else i kept doing the songs that i liked to do 
audiences really began discovering ross in the late 1970s when 
he played a nowdisappeared club and restaurant called ted hooks 
backstage located just west of eighth avenue in the theater 
district 
over his piano there was built a big false piano around which 
customers could sit diners in the large restaurant could also hear 
him 
while the club was there it was really a wonderful amalgam 
ross says people came to look people came to be looked at 
stagehands and stars 
alice faye would get up and sing or liza minnelli would join 
ross in a duet 
audiences also discovered ross passion for obscure good songs 
an enthusiastic sheet music collector he searches everywhere for 
new old material and has resurrected many an unknown porter or 
coward rarity the title of his new album most of every day 
is a rare coward song now people bring him songs new and old 
how does ross pick the songs he sings 
the words have to work first he says when its just me 
and the piano i want to have good words i cant make it on a high 
note im not pavarotti so the words have to be important 
in 1981 ross became the first performer in 40 years to play the 
algonquin hotels famed oak room he stayed for four years since 
then he hasnt given his passport a rest london venice hong 
kong australia even kenya where he wowed them in nairobi now 
hes ready to hang his hat in new york for a while its the city 
that suits him best its possibilities are endless 
the essence of romance is possibility ross says thats 
why new york is such a romantic place anything can happen you 
cross the street something comes to town you go into a place 
thats why i cant leave this city anything can happen here

just a little over four years ago 
on march 15 1985 thousands of brazilians waving 
greenyellowandblue national flags rushed up the main ramp of 
the presidential palace in brasilia and cheered their nascent new 
republic 
the rightwing generals who had ruled for 21 years had stepped 
aside and hopes ran high brazil under civilian direction would 
bound forward toward the prosperous future so many had envisioned 
it hasnt happened 
and some brazilians often out of frustration say it was better 
when the generals ran things 
today under the centrist civilian presidency of jose sarney 
the 200 percent annual inflation left by the generals has soared to 
more than 1000 percent the cruzado currency has been devalued by 
a factor of 1 million 
public officials who were supposed to show how a responsible 
democracy could work in south america are involved in seemingly 
nonending scandals of payoffs kickbacks nepotism and misuse of 
government funds 
public services are deteriorating big cities are grimier than 
ever street crime is rising strikes often accompanied by 
violence disrupt daily life in one form or another 
brazilians with money and skills seek visas for portugal italy 
australia and canada or as a last resort to get into the united 
states and stay there illegally 
brazil is smothered by the biggest foreign debt in the third 
world 115 billion 
its only a matter of time before the armed forces will have 
to come back in a brazilian executive said recently on a luxury 
yacht sailing past sugar loaf mountain 
a taxi driver tells a passenger that all he has made for his 
long day negotiating rio de janeiros traffic is 15 cruzados 15 
at the official rate but in reality worth only 810 
why dont the generals just take over this he snarls 
still hes better off than most only 35 percent of brazilians 
make more than the minimum wage which is the equivalent of 64 a 
month 
indications are the taxi driver is not likely to get his wish 
the armed forces have shown no inclination to get involved again in 
politics military chiefs say repeatedly they will support the 
winner of the presidential election nov 15 no matter who it is 
and while some of the talk seems to favor a military return 
brazilians in general when it comes down to it hope it doesnt 
happen the dictatorships of 19301945 and 19641985 are still 
clearly remembered censorship secret arrests even torture 
in 1985 the new republic broadcast a slogan for government 
action everything for social progress 
but a study this year led by the sociologist helio jaguaribe 
and titled brazil reform or chaos concluded in no other 
country in the world not even india are social contrasts so 
shocking 
the research indicated that 41 percent of all brazilians live 
in a state of misery or strict poverty 
along rios stylish ipanema beach abandoned children in raggedy 
shorts sleep on the sidewalk outside 1million oceanview condos 
with garages protecting 75000 mercedes sports cars 
the amount of brazils total wealth held by the richest 1 
percent of the population about 13 percent equals that of the 
poorest 50 percent 
more than half of brazils tillable farmland is in the hands of 
2 percent of the countrys farmers 
although brazil has renowned universities and graduate programs 
just 9 percent of schoolage children make it through eighth grade 
the fundamental characteristic of brazilian society is its 
profound duality the jaguaribe study said on one side there 
is a modern industrial society on the other is a primitive 
society living at a subsistence level 
jair meneguelli is president of the militant central workers 
union which organized a partly successful twoday national protest 
strike in march 
brazils current crisis stems from a long history of 
corruption and a total lack of proper government priorities such as 
housing health and education he said 
if brazil does not change the future will be one of social 
convulsion

what brazil needs meneguelli said is the victory of a leftist 
reformer such as luis inacio lula da silva in novembers 
presidential balloting 
what brazil needs is time said sarney a 58yearold 
politician lawyer and poet 
he added in an interview with the associated press we have 
consolidated democratic institutions political groups formerly 
considered extremist now are playing politics by democratic rules 
we have not had any military uprisings or serious social 
upheavals 
one large problem is official graft charges of official 
corruption appear almost daily in the press officials including a 
cabinet minister routinely referred to as robber scarcely 
bother to refute them 
newsphotos purport to show official cars taking functionaries 
children to expensive private schools and their maids to the 
supermarket 
also underlying brazils ills is the enormous foreign debt 
sarney said that if creditors the main ones are big us banks 
simply do not write off part of what is owed democracy will be 
threatened and marxist alternatives will start looking attractive 
to the people 
most of the money was borrowed by the military government 
without objection from a rubberstamp congress but it did help 
brazil build some things necessary for progress airports and 
highways a modern telephone system a 10mile bridge across 
guanabara bay from rio to niteroi and the itaipu dam the worlds 
largest hydroelectric generator 
but a lot more money was wasted on projects that never panned 
out 
the borrowed money also created a veritable army of bigspending 
technocrats who in turn proliferated bureaucracies generally 
unaccountable to public scrutiny 
the ordinarily progovernment newspaper o globo of rio 
complained recently of gigantic gangs of lazy bureaucrats whose 
salaries and free spending affront millions of fellow citizens who 
because of ignorance must wait in lines of want and misery 
president sarney noted in the interview with the ap in brasilia 
that brazil in the last four years has paid 50 billion in debt 
interest alone money that would have allowed the implanatation 
of a gigantic program of national development 
shortly after taking office in 1985 sarney announced a sweeping 
program called brazil 2000 to improve living standards and 
reduce social inequality little or nothing has come of it 
sarney says brazil does not want confrontation with the foreign 
banks and governments and international organizations it owes money 
to 
but brazils next president might not be so moderate 
lula da silva a former strike organizer and leader of the 
marxistinspired workers party goes along with the view of 
president fidel castro of cuba brazil shouldnt pay any more 
leonel brizola a populist leftist firebrand of the 1960s who 
now calls himself a europeanstyle socialist says that while 
brazil shouldnt become an outright deadbeat the debt in its 
present form cannot be paid 
a private poll done in march and widely regarded as accurate 
indicated that brizola and da silva are the frontrunners at this 
point in the presidential race although the campaign is not 
officially under way 
finance minister mailson da nobrega told a group of foreign 
correspondents recently that if foreign creditors dont reduce the 
debt brazilians and other latin americans will turn to radicals 
and demagogues for future leadership 
but brazilians are fond of saying god is brazilian and not 
everyone is pessimistic 
brazil is further along the road to the upside scenario than 
many think said christopher r lund of the american chamber of 
commerce in sao paulo the nations financial center 
brazil is discovering more oil and gold and some voices now are 
being raised in favor of conserving rather than destroying the 
huge amazon rain forest 
and there still are brazilians who believe their country can 
make it through oldfashioned hard work 
brazils crisis has little to do with the political transition 
and much less with the foreign debt said sen roberto campos of 
the rightwing social democratic party who under the military 
regime was planning minister and ambassador to the united states 
campos solution 
deregulation more aggressive free enterprise unrestricted 
trade international market integration no more talk of marxism 
and labor militancy and an end to obsolete thinking and the lack 
of ideas for stimulating development

a middleclass middleaged woman 
with no political experience is shaking up rio de janeiro with a 
rare and risky campaign to clean up corruption in the city council 
regina gordilho elected to public office for the first time in 
november says she has received death threats almost every day 
since her moralization campaign got under way 
mrs gordilho 54 was a small businesswoman until two years 
ago when her son was beaten to death by five state policemen 
after a judge freed them all she ran for the city council and won 
her democratic labor party which won the most seats chose her 
to be the councils president 
when she took office in january she found that about 3000 
public employees worked for the council which had just 42 members 
many of them were friends and relatives of officeholders earning 
salaries of up to 600 a month in contrast to the national minimum 
wage of 64 a month and the average monthly wage in rio de janeiro 
of about 90 
it as a time too that the city government had imposed 
belttightening measures and cut service cuts to save rio de 
janeiro from bankruptcy rios streets were full of potholes 
garbage often sat uncollected and hospitals and schools frequently 
were shut down 
mrs gordilho focused on the 3000 employees 
she discovered that many of them had been hired illegally and 
though cashing paychecks every month never came to work 
theres no need for more than 500 functionaries at the 
council she said in an interview but councilmen are using the 
administrative section to benefit themselves their friends and 
their families 
mrs gordilho investigated hiring practices and discovered 
forged personnel documents she demanded that all employees 
reregister to receive their paychecks 
as a result 398 employees hired with falsified documents were 
fired about 500 others who failed to reregister were dropped from 
the payroll five excouncilmen and three currently in office were 
arraigned on criminal charges with three of the eight being from 
mrs gordilhos own party 
we had 14 and 15yearold kids relatives of councilmen 
hired as advisers she said 
she said one councilman alone was responsible for 93 fraudulent 
hirings 
the irregularities are so widespread it will take some time 
to discover them all she said but the certainty of impunity 
is gone forever 
mrs gordilho said it never entered her mind to become a 
political crusader until march 17 1987 the day her son 
23yearold son marcellus was beaten to death by the state troopers 
he was surfing with several friends in a poor section of the 
city when a misunderstanding arose with a trooper who claimed 
marcellus had improper identification the trooper and four of his 
colleagues decided to take marcellus into the police station for 
questioning 
when the youth struggled to avoid being thrown into the back of 
a police van the officers beat him so severely he suffered two 
broken legs and brain damage by the time mrs gordilho arrived at 
the hospital he was dead 
mrs gordilho crusaded for punishment of the troopers but 
despite six months of legal action and street protests a judge 
exonerated four of the policemen 
the fifth the commanding officer was given a 18month 
suspended jail sentence but he was able to keep his job because a 
policeman can be dismissed only if sentenced to more than two years 
for a crime 
she maintained that impunity for the powerful is a leftover 
from brazils 19641985 military government and that ordinary 
citizens still are struggling to recover their rights 
her attempt to clean up the city government has gained mrs 
gordilho widespread backing she said she has been receiving as 
many as 300 letters a from all over brazil 
maria helena moreira alves a professor of political economy at 
the university of the state of rio de janeiro said mrs gordilhos 
popularity stems from a growing sense of outrage over corruption 
at all levels of society 
mrs gordilho has her detractors as well including those who 
threaten to kill her in letters and in telephone calls 
the machine gun already has arrived from paraguay said a 
letter she received in march the bullet will be a dumdum 
without salvation 
these sorts of abuses are common throughout brazil mrs 
gordilho said somebodys got to try to change that

some of the most interesting films of 1988 stemmed from novels 
dangerous liaisons the accidental tourist little 
dorrit the last temptation of christ the unbearable 
lightness of being pelle the conqueror 
while original screenplays remain the most prevalent source of 
films it is heartening to see the comeback of novels 
why so because from the birth of a nation to gone with 
the wind to terms of endearment novels have lent film 
entertainment a substance that is often lacking on a diet of 
scripts originated by screenwriters and homogenized by countless 
rewrites 
winter people is the latest evidence adapted by carol 
sobieski from john ehles novel the film has faults and excesses 
but it also offers a certain majesty and an accurate sense of time 
and place the blue ridge mountains in the depression 1930s 
wayland jackson kurt russell is a watchmaker who is driving 
his motherless daughter amelia burnette to philadelphia to start 
a new life when their pickup truck is wrecked in a mountain 
stream they take refuge with a mysterious woman kelly mcgillis 
who lives in a remote cabin with her fatherless baby boy 
the mystery unravels mcgillis has been ostracized by her 
family the wrights who are the leading citizens of a nearby 
village the father of her child is the unruly son jeffrey meek 
of the lawless henderson clan longtime enemies of the wrights 
russell wins the young mothers confidence and love and the 
respect of her family after proving his manhood on a bear hunt 
when the father of mcgillis son dies mysteriously the 
longsmoldering feud between the wrights and the hendersons erupts 
in violence 
director ted kotcheff manages to keep the complicated plot 
running smoothly though at times the mountain dialect is hard to 
comprehend kelly mcgillis gives understated strength to her role 
and kurt russell has his strongest characterization to date though 
the transition from milquetoast to macho man is less than smooth 
lloyd nolan and mitchell ryan are powerful as patriarchs of the 
two families as the violent henderson jeffrey meek is terrifying 
the mountain scenery has been stunningly photographed by francois 
protat 
winter people was produced by robert h solo for columbia 
pictures scariness and sexual tension give it a pg13 rating 
running time 115 minutes

mascara warner home video vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
this film version of bizarre sex and murder in the decadent 
operagoing upperclass of paris is pure eurotrash from beginning to 
end 
starring charlotte rampling michael sarrazin and derek de lint 
it limps along exploiting sexual themes that include normal acts 
as well as incest homosexuality transsexualism sadomasochism 
and bondage 
the film wanders through dark alleys tunnels and rainwashed 
streets to the hangout of the weird where one is greeted by a 
throaty halfspoken heavily accented version of help me make it 
through the night its supposed to remind us of the decadence of 
blue angel and marlene dietrichs smoky presentations 
the story tumbles along with uninspired scripting and arty 
photography until rampling pushes brother sarrazin a burnedout 
police detective and murderer over the edge sotospeak after he 
declares the only man worthy of her is himself 
in the final scene rampling dissolves into a pieta pose 
holding the corpse of her lover de lint who sarrazin had a mob 
of transvestites or transsexuals and whatnots beat almost to death 
before they tossed him into the ocean 
it is one of those pretentious films in which the authors 
directors and actors play at being supersophisticated it probably 
would make for lofty discussions of allegories and metaphors by 
pseudointellectuals at a cocktail party but for entertainment 
purposes its merely exploitative and boring

betrayed which should be a terrifying view of bigotry and 
the ease with which it thrives instead is an implausible and 
unsatisfying movie from costagavras one of cinemas most esteemed 
architects 
the movie works best as suspense but intends so much more 
cathy weaver debra winger a rightthinking undercover fbi agent 
tries to infiltrate a white supremacist network the agency believes 
responsible for the slaying of a loud obnoxious radio talk show 
host gary tom berenger is the sweet downhome widower farmer 
she falls for he also is a top gun in the racist network 
although the actors do their best to provide depth the 
characters are not convincing it makes no sense that liberal cathy 
would fall for gary despite his pot roastmaking mom and 
sweetaspie kids it makes no sense that gary after spending 
years developing his secret network would so easily take cathy 
into his every confidence it makes no sense that cathys fbi 
supervisors take so little care with her when she finally realizes 
her target is the man she loves 
still there are some powerful scenes in one garys little 
girl in a comforting bedtime chat with cathy suddenly spews an 
incredible frightening string of hateful epithets in another 
gary takes cathy and his kids to a white supremacist camp a place 
of cross burnings gun trading and preparation to take back the

the truth is spoken here rcanovus marcus roberts 
 
marcus roberts the young pianist who regularly plays in wynton 
marsalis band has released his first album as a leader and its 
an unabashed tribute to thelonious monk 
although only one of the eight numbers is a monk composition 
several of roberts own tunes conjure up the quirky style of the 
late pianist three numbers even feature a longtime monk sideman 
the late tenor saxophonist charlie rouse he died in december at 
age 64 and this was his last recording session 
roberts praises monks music as the reconciliation of 
opposites that is so central to the production of great music 
and added he is certainly one of the role models that i look to 
for guidance in my quest for musical understanding roberts too 
reconciles opposites a maturity that belies his 25 years and the 
adolescent whimsy for which monk was known 
marsalis contributed his stylish trumpet to the album roberts 
let his mentor take off with a breezy muted solo on the opening 
number the arrival heralded by drummer elvin jones the lone 
monk composition blue monk was a solo rendering in a stride 
piano style that bordered on boogie 
roberts sensitivity came through in a pair of ballads the 
pianists own tonally complex maurella and the beautiful 
single petal of a rose an ellingtonstrayhorn composition that 
conjured up debussy 
ellingtons in a mellow tone the most satisfying tune in 
the set had rouse playing the straight man while roberts provided 
the humor a minor blues country by choice featured a growing 
series of piano choruses with roberts dodging and weaving around 
the pattern like a running back nothin but the blues a basic 
12bar blues pattern with heavy monkian flavor was the closer 
roberts blind since he was 4 has made an impressive album 
debut his technical skill dedication and passion portend 
considerable success

spike warner bros elvis costello 
 
elvis costellos sprawling new spike is just the kind of 
record critics love its got voluminous lyrics with a liberal 
bent touches on a wide array of musical styles and has plenty of 
guest stars 
but dont let that scare you 
spike may be a difficult record to grasp and costello 
sometimes takes himself too seriously but theres plenty of 
treasures here for the people with the patience to sift through 
them 
most fascinating is costellos new songwriting collaboration 
with paul mccartney veronica is just what youd hope from such 
a partnership an intelligently written song about an old woman 
reliving her life in dreams married to a breezy arrangement 
reminiscent of baby youre a rich man 
the other macmanusmccartney song pads paws and claws is 
a rockabilly number that suffers from a cluttered arrangement 
this town a booming rocker highlighted by roger 
mcguinns guitar and mccartneys bass lampoons the wall street 
syndrome of success at all costs its one of costellos most 
infectious songs 
costellos vitriol is sharp on tramp the dirt down where 
his fantasy is to dance on margaret thatchers grave gods 
comic about a former vaudeville comedian meeting his maker is 
funny in a warped sort of way 
baby plays around which costello cowrote with his wife 
cait oriordan is delicately beautiful its straightforward 
emotional lyrics also highlight costellos weakness elsewhere his 
tendency to run off at the mouth 
his lyrics are easily among the most intelligent in music today 
but he still has trouble simply telling a story in the funky 
chewing gum he can barely spit out the words fast enough and 
the stately melody of satellite is marred by lyrics that dont 
quite connect what exactly is he trying to say about love in the 
80s 
an artist who challenges his listeners of course is always 
better than someone who panders to them theres no pandering on 
spike costello takes his listeners on a trip through rock 
jazz funk irish music and ballads 
the rides not always smooth but its never boring

when director james ivory and producer ismail 
merchant first tried to hook up on a film project they failed 
that was 1962 
the two have rarely missed since teaming up with writer ruth 
prawer jhabvala for a series of wellcrafted adaptations of classic 
novels such as henry james the bostonians and em forsters 
a room with a view 
while merchant and ivory have specialized in period pieces they 
dont rule out filming a contemporary piece of fiction when 
jhabvala read the first installment of tama janowitzs chronicle of 
downtown manhattan the slaves of new york she urged the two 
to consider the book for their next project 
ive always liked downtown new york ivory said i 
couldnt say im a habitue of that particular part of town or that 
particular scene tama wrote about but i like the look of it its 
a sort of subculture 
the new york of soho with its bohemian art galleries colorful 
inhabitants and lofts couldnt be further away from the pastoral 
beauty of forsters works but ivory was quickly convinced that the 
stories in the slaves of new york had cinematic potential 
they were funny and nice and interesting he said shes a 
very visual writer the same way that henry james is or em 
forster as you read you could just picture it 
turning books into film is at best a risky proposition the 
plot must often be streamlined to conform to the medium and the 
director has a harder time expressing complex thoughts than the 
novelist 
also as the makers of portnoys complaint and the great 
gatsby unhappily found out great novels dont necessarily make 
great movies and slaves of new york has generally received 
poor reviews 
if its something that could be called literature its up to 
you to convey the tone of voice of the writer ivory said you 
may not be all that truthful to the story as they told it you may 
leave things you may add things youre giving a cinematic 
equivalent to their tone of voice 
slaves of new york stars bernadette peters as eleanor a 
copyreader at an east village newspaper who lives with her selfish 
and manipulative boyfriend stash merchant and ivory agreed that 
the tony awardwinning actress was miles ahead of anyone else they 
considered for the lead role 
i feel that shes sort of the reigning broadway star ivory 
said shes inherited the crown of mary martin and ethel merman 
to work with someone like that whos more or less at the peak of 
her fame is a privilege for a director 
merchant recalled that they had tried to recruit peters for a 
previous film we wanted her to play in the wild party but it 
didnt work out we had always admired her and wanted to work with 
her she has a wonderful quality like judy holliday that 
tragicomic feel 
merchant and ivory have had their greatest success with the 
works of forster earning critical praise for maurice and 
room with a view which was nominated for eight academy awards 
in 1986 
both pictures were based in europe at the turn of the century 
a room with a view centered on a young heiress emotional and 
physical awakening while maurice dealt with the more 
commercially risky subject of two young mens homosexual 
relationship 
there were such interesting characters and the story was so 
good merchant said of the latter for people who go through 
that the fears and horrors and all the rest of it involved thats 
never changed at all and it probably never will change 
ivory saw a common thread for the two films being honest with 
yourself just to be honest with your feelings and dont deceive 
yourself 
merchant and ivory have worked together for more than 25 years 
an unusually long time in the highpressure motion picture 
industry ivory credited the success of the partnership to respect 
of each others opinions 
nobody tries to ram down the throats of the others something 
they dont want to do he said no one goes stamping around 
like some dictator over the others therefore we can all do what 
we want 
the director sees the films as an expression of their 
collaboration 
i think theyre a reflection of our lives more than 
anything he said they reflect our own preoccupations our 
interests and how our interests have changed its a collective 
autobiography its the line of our lives

when he was younger conductor sergiu 
celibidache was known as an eccentric now hes known as a legend 
an artist who seeks truth in music and presents it like no other 
conductor a man who infuses his work with zen 
at 76 years old celibidache is making his first american tour 
with the munich philharmonic he will do 14 concerts this month in 
11 cities the two concerts at carnegie hall sold out in march 
for the last five years celibidache has conducted only the 
munich philharmonic rehearsals at gasteig hall in munich which 
are free are always full he doesnt allow recordings because he 
believes that taping changes the speed and brilliance of the 
performance 
he uses the principals of zen and phenomenology in his work the 
zen part is celibidache and the orchestra rehearsing a lot then his 
emptying his mind during the concert and having often a 
transcendent experience phenomenology is the study of perceptual 
experience in its subjective state 
it is eternal no he said all the nos are eliminated and 
we are only yes the musicians would not call it phenomenology 
they say oh he knows what he does 
phenomenology is the sience of why not so it is not a causal 
why in the zen discipline you say is this this is this this 
also it is not because this is the result of that transcendence 
is the phase where thinking is over but we still go on living and 
experiencing 
i studied buddhism when i was 17 i read about this kind of 
ego i met a zen monk i had a master you come to the point where 
zen will take over 
emptiness means the highest form of concentration you 
have the possibility to step in every second the prophets of the 
old testament practiced that kind of consciousness if it became 
part of the conscious will it didnt work 
when the eighth bar of a piece of music is wrong celibidache 
said it is because it didnt follow from the first bar and lead to 
the last when i was 42 i had an experience in venice when i 
made music i saw the connection it is the beginning and the end 
not one after the other but simultaneously 
he was conducting three masses in a venice church with two 
choirs that didnt cooperate choral sound from balconies arrived 
at a different rate than orchestral sound saturday rehearsal was 
chaos celibidache recalled and he wanted to cancel sunday 
morning i prayed just to finish together 
on that sunday the church was packed windows were open for 
people outside people were in aisles and the stairs up to his 
podium were removed to make room for more bodies celibidache said 
he could remember nothing after the performance started 
normal practice is when something happens wrong in the 
orchestra you start trying to remake it and sometimes you succeed 
and sometimes not nothing of that kind happened i remember the 
final amen and i came to a kind of normal consciousness again 
he said 
that was the first experience i went to conduct brahms after 
venice now i have experienced it i want to have it again i put my 
whole weight behind it and pushed celibidache discovered what 
zen could have told him that he could not will a transcendent 
experience 
i always am animated by the idea to know the composers 
original ideas he said and he doesnt conduct with 
discoveries or own ideas 
i dont have any own ideas at all my object and my strength 
is to find out what was the composers ideas what did he mean i 
have not discovered anything 
if you think what i do is an interpretation youre wrong 
he said this is the authentic way to play according to what we 
could inquire about the way a composer used to play 
celibidache said that too much music is mixed with economics 
why not more rehearsals because rehearsals do not pay he said 
who conducts nowadays in europe the people whom deutsche 
grammaphon records recommends maybe there are good conductors we 
do not know in a small village somewhere in the big cities that 
is not possible 
celibidache was born in romania and went to germany to study 
composition conducting and musicology in 1936 when he was 24 he 
was principal conductor of the berlin philharmonic from the end of 
world war ii until 1952 when herbert von karajan came in 
celibidache became a guest conductor in europe and latin america 
but american orchestras and some european orchestras didnt engage 
him because of his rehearsal requirements he likes to rehearse 
when and as often as he likes 
the curtis institute of music in philadelphia invited 
celibidache to train the student orchestra for several months in 
198384 celibidache has been in munich since 1979 
i always avoided the big orchestras which can follow only one 
track and i avoided living under the pressure of big cities he 
said big symphonies can not afford much rehearsal time and if 
they give it they will cry still one year after 
when munich came to me i said i need very many rehearsals 
i dont accept any pressure i can not guarantee you a certain 
rhythm of production they said it is all right for us what 
else do you want i said nothing that is how i land in munich 
i promised them ill make the munich philharmonic the best 
orchestra in the world i will contend that munich is nowadays the 
best orchestra as far as musical dialectic of the inner parts are 
concerned i dont know any big orchestra which orients itself like 
chamber music this has been not because celibidache has such great 
power it is because i could find in the musicians an extraordinary 
comprehension the fact that we play bruckner without facing a 
single negative reaction is the confirmation of what i believe in

ask john updike what he remembers most about his 
life and you might expect him to talk of his many honors including 
the pulitzer prize and the american book award 
or maybe youd expect thoughts about his 13 novels 10 volumes 
of short stories and five collections of poetry or perhaps proud 
tales of his four children 
but the writer prefers to dwell on simpler events such as 
childhood memories of waiting to hear the footsteps of the mailman 
then lying underneath the chute so the letters could tumble on his 
face or the time in junior high school when he stabbed himself in 
the palm of his right hand with a lead pencil leaving a permanent 
scar 
updike who insisted in a recent interview that his life 
hasnt had too many things big in it concentrated on seemingly 
minor incidents by default 
i managed to avoid all my countrys wars the author of 
rabbit run and the witches of eastwick said i avoided 
many of the problems that inflict people i never had my house burn 
down never had a major disease ive been a lucky person ive 
tried to make a story of normal and totally uneventful lives 
his most recent work is selfconsciousness knopf 1895 
a collection of six essays that come together like an unofficial 
memoir updike remembers his childhood in shillington pa his 
lukewarm support for the vietnam war and his battle with psoriasis 
and stuttering 
he also offers a detailed account of his family tree and 
concludes the book with an essay called on being a self 
forever which sums up his philosophy that even something as 
obscure as a signature is a form of expression 
i think the writer who showed me what could be done and in a 
way haunts this book is marcel proust the way he can so 
regularly twirl one of these highly developed details around and go 
on to moralize in this quite persuasive and powerful way he said 
proust is a writer who tried to extract religious meanings out 
of random life he had the notion that nothing is random 
updike was born in 1932 and enjoyed drawing as a child sending 
fan mail to prominent cartoonists begging them for original work 
a surprising number obliged he said i dont know if 
garry trudeau would send four panels off to an inquiring child i 
got mickey finn and joe palooka and political cartoons receipt of 
these things in the mail was a way of making the mail a very 
dramatic crystalized experience for myself 
he wrote for the shillington high school newspaper and set his 
sights on working for the new yorker magazine which he joined in 
1955 he contributed short stories and light verse but soon tired 
of living in manhattan in 1957 he and his first wife mary moved 
to ipswich a small town outside of boston 
his first novel poorhouse fair was released in 1959 the 
following year updike came out with rabbit run the story of 
harry rabbit angstrom a 26yearold husband and father in the 
fictional town of brewer pa longing for his days as a high school 
basketball star rabbit is unable to face the responsibilities 
of growing up and runs away 
rabbit would become updikes faithful alter ego appearing 
again in the sequels rabbit redux and rabbit is rich which 
earned the writer a pulitzer an american book award and the 
national book critics circle award in 1981 
rabbit is always there for me updike said he always is 
willing to go through the paces i send up for him and the whole 
pennsylvania milieu is very convenient and very rich the rabbit 
books are full of the weight of the terrible things that happen 
for updike writing is a way of relieving pain in the essay 
at war with my skin he vividly describes his attempts to find 
a cure for that monstrosity psoriasis a scaly skin disorder 
in getting the words out he attempts to find a reason for 
his stuttering wondering if the impediment is an 
acknowledgement in conversation of the framework of 
unacknowledged complexity that surrounds the simplest exchange of 
words 
updike noted that writing about those afflictions helped ease 
their symptoms 
in a way i have a duty having set up shop as a fiction 
writer to explore the world as fully as i can including those 
corners that i would rather avoid in real life he said 
theres a kind of therapeutic action in the course of writing 
writing is a way of taming life and putting it into a package and 
once its packaged it becomes less overwhelming 
he sees writing as consistent with his fondness for the image of 
logs going over a waterfall the feeling of events passing by 
each day is over the waterfall there is a kind of bliss in 
that we grow lighter with all these riddances the good 
riddance thank god thats over feeling is one of the happy 
feelings i have

a year after the failure of her highly 
touted network tv show dolly parton has returned to her roots the 
country music she learned growing up in a tworoom smoky mountain 
shack 
the 43yearold performer celebrating her 25th year as an 
entertainer has just released her 50th album white limozeen 
parton raised in an east tennessee hollow where she was the 
fourth of 12 children says the lp is a departure from her pop 
music megahit with kenny rogers islands in the stream 
its very country she said in an interview its a good 
album for me to do at this time its very true to what i do best 
it captures a lot of the old sound i used to do years and years 
ago 
it is her second album since trio a grammywinning 
millionselling collaboration with two partners of vocal purity 
linda ronstadt and emmylou harris 
the trio album kind of set up the pace for this one 
parton said its what the public has been wanting me to do for 
awhile 
her onehour abc variety show which was not renewed for a 
second season didnt deserve to stay on the air she said the 
show was very confusing it never found a direction no matter how 
hard i tried it never came together never jelled because it was 
so disjointed 
i wanted the show to be something like hee haw when it 
started but it was more like hem haw thats all everybody did 
hem and haw 
she recently revived her acting career joining sally field 
shirley maclaine and others in the movie steel magnolias based 
on the broadway play and due for release in late summer its about 
a group of southern women 
its a fine piece of work as good as ive done she said 
we all got along great and made great friends i like it when 
its that way 
its her first motion picture since rhinestone in 1984 with 
sylvester stallone a movie savaged by the critics 
it rhinestone was a hit with me but i didnt think it was 
a great movie parton recalled it got worse as it went along 
it started out kind of slow and tapered off stallone had a lot of 
energy and was very funny but the movie itself was not great 
with energy matched by ambition she made two other movies 9 
to 5 with jane fonda and lily tomlin and the best little 
whorehouse in texas with burt reynolds 
9 to 5 was very cute and very good it was a timely movie 
with womens lib going on it was the best thing ive done 
whorehouse was a difficult movie to do she said i 
would say it was average it made a lot of money but didnt get 
good reviews there was a lot of blood on the movie ill feelings 
from the broadway show and the original producers but i loved burt 
and all the people in it 
she and rogers are seen every december in their sentimental 
madefortv special kenny and dolly a christmas to remember 
people can see the warmth and love and sincerity in our 
friendship she said about the enduring popularity of the show 
it was family oriented with children and church and special 
little things in it 
id like for us to do another one now that ive slimmed down a 
little 50 pounds worth every time i see myself in it i say 
look at the christmas tree 
reviewing her singing career parton says islands in the 
stream remains special among the 47 single records she has 
released 
its the one song in my whole career that i never get tired of 
hearing or singing if i hear it on the radio i turn that song up 
and i usually dont do that with my records 
its such a pleasant song easy listening its not heavy and 
its real positive it was well written and has a great melody and 
chord progression and i think kenny and me sang great together 
our voices complimented each other 
a sequel to trio she says is probably not forthcoming 
it took us 10 years to get that one done as busy as we all 
are its not likely wed all love to see it happen but the 
chances are slim and speaking for myself you dont want to mess 
with something good 
she says gimmicks have enhanced her image which has contributed 
to her success as one of the nations best known personalities 
the way i look being so outrageous the fact i look phony 
and am real has created a bit of a mystery and magic that works 
she said 
i try to have the gimmick the big hair and loud clothes and 
high heels and long fingernails all of this is born out of a 
serious place because the hair and heels give me height which i 
want but it works somehow i wouldnt want to look simple id 
look like a blank wall

stage fright that mysterious malady that 
renders a performer helpless in the footlights has been known to 
wreck many a budding career 
but in the case of the british rock band xtc whose new record 
oranges and lemons is climbing the charts it may actually have 
helped 
xtc was a struggling punk band in 1982 when leader andy 
partridge finding it more and more difficult to perform live 
collapsed on stage during a concert in paris it was his last live 
performance but instead of falling apart xtc became studio 
hermits and their music flowered 
rather than being a monotone creation something red and blue 
suddenly there were all these colors coming out in the music that 
we hadnt even considered putting in there partridge said in a 
telephone interview from his home in the english town of swindon 
from the 1982 album english settlement onward our music 
started getting a lot better he said but it wouldnt have 
done that if we hadnt gone off the road if we hadnt stopped 
touring i think in the space of a year the group would have split 
up 
xtcs music is like a lost letter from the 1960s a reflection 
of the british psychedelic beat groups with which partridge and 
partners colin moulding and dave gregory grew up their innate 
tunefulness is wedded to clever and occasionally provocative lyrics 
and though partridge is reluctant to publicly admit it the 
15song oranges and lemons is the peak of a recording career 
that began in 1978 the public thinks so the record is at no 47 
on the billboard charts led by the single the mayor of 
simpleton 
the breezy love song is a far cry from the groups last flirt 
with public attention in the united states the controversial 
single dear god drew protests in 1986 from fundamentalist 
groups angered by the implicit endorsement of atheism 
if people got upset by it they deserved to get upset by it 
partridge said its the truth 
actually the 35yearold musician said hes amused to attract 
so much notoriety for a song he considered a failure dear god 
was initially left off the album skylarking and released only 
as a bside to a single 
nothing on oranges and lemons is quite so explosive the 
mayor of simpleton attracts notice for the right reasons its a 
sprightly melody with lyrics about a man who knows he cant impress 
a woman with brains so he does it with love 
partridge said he took from his own experience of being labeled 
a failure for quitting school at age 15 
in england you tend to get written off as nothing as a piece 
of air if you left school and have no qualifications to do 
anything he said i felt like i didnt need those things i 
felt my emotions were intact and i knew enough to get by i felt 
like i had kind of innate intelligence that didnt need to be put 
in certificate form 
the mayor of simpleton is a love song that proves you 
dont need those certificates to be able to feel emotionally he 
said 
xtcs early music through songs such as making plans for 
nigel and generals and majors was known for its jerky 
rhythms and hyperactive pace constant touring had something to do 
with it partridge described the life as living on constant fear 
pellets 
i started to get stage fright which was rather ludicrous 
he said because rather than getting more relaxed on stage i was 
getting less relaxed more wound up 
leaving the road allowed xtc to experiment with new instruments 
and sounds without the worry of having to reproduce the music on 
stage it allowed such influences as the beatles and hollies to 
show 
xtc acknowledged these debts with a spinoff band called the 
dukes of stratosphear in two records the dukes eerily reproduced 
the sound of their favorite 60s bands particularly their 
psychedelic sides partridge said it was a musical thank you note 
ive always liked forgery he said i thought forgery was 
a fine art i used to forge money when i was a kid id sit for 
hours with different colored pens trying to get it right 
partridge writes roughly 80 percent of the groups music with 
moulding contributing a few songs per album the trio handles 
guitars and keyboards and hires a new drummer for each album 
project since the groups original drummer terry chambers left 
when the touring stopped mr mister drummer pat mastelotto handled 
the sticks for the new record 
partridge is the father of two children ages 3 and 1 and their 
influence can also be seen in oranges and lemons garden of 
earthly delights introduces a child to the wonders of the world 
and hold me my daddy is about coming to terms with love for a 
father 
they have not crept into the music partridge said of his 
children theyve more sort of crawled and crashed in at five in 
the morning i think its been very positive they have been an 
inspiration 
executives at geffen xtcs label initially tried to coax xtc 
back on stage but with the success of skylarking and oranges 
and lemons partridge said thats stopped since theyre selling 
more records than they ever did while touring why argue with 
success even if it contradicts standard industry practice 
partridge wont be spending his free time with the dukes who he 
said were killed in a bizarre cooking accident xtc is instead 
thinking of recording a sampler album in which they imitate a 
variety of bands and styles from the 1940s to the 1980s he said 
he chuckles at the thought that xtc which pays such a heavy 
debt to its own influences is now influencing another generation 
of music fans 
it makes me feel like theres some kind of potent chemical 
getting into their system he said

stress is turning kids into pencilchewing 
teethgritting bundles of nerves according to experts who say such 
problems in early elementary school can lead to increased teen drug 
use sex and suicide 
a survey of more than 4000 kansas kindergarten through third 
graders showed that 42 percent experienced negative stress 
behavior which includes headaches inability to sleep biting 
fingernails worrying about doing poorly in school stomach aches 
and short tempers said darrel lang director of the center of 
health promotion and wellness at emporia state university 
here we are in kansas the middle of the country 
conservative the pace is slower said lang my feeling is that 
larger communities in more populated states the stress levels in 
kids are much higher 
because stress ingrained at an early age generally remains with 
children the consequences in teen age can be devastating he said 
similar behavior was found through grade 12 in the survey of 18000 
kansas students 
kids are more stressed out today because our society has more 
stress said lang its a reflection of the society in which we 
live a lot of people think stress is an adult condition well 
its not 
the stress kids are under in early childhood from domineering 
parents to broken homes to a more competitive society is leading 
children to higher rates of suicide pregnancy substance abuse to 
drop out and to health problems such as chronic heart disease and 
obesity experts say 
the causes of stress are as varied as the consequences but 
experts agree the no 1 source of kid stress is at home 
if a child goes from a warm home to a cold school they have a 
chance of surviving if they come from a warm home to a warm 
school of course they will make it but if they come from a cold 
home to a cold school there is no way they will make it said 
margaret fitch an assistant superintendent from omaha neb who 
addressed a meeting on stress late last month 
the problem has grown worse educators say because of an 
increasingly competitive society and the growing number of 
singleparent families all of which contribute to a lack of 
communication 
a typical parent communicates with their kid an average of 14 
minutes a day said richard nelson associate professor of 
education at the university of kansas and about 12 of those 
minutes are spent discussing such unimportant things as what is for 
dinner 
another source of stress are parents who treat their children as 
status symbols and instill a belief in the children that they must 
behave right wear the right clothes make the right grades and 
have the right friends 
those parents give their children conditional love nelson 
said they say we will love you if 
stressed children generally remain stressed as teens he said 
they can turn to drugs at an earlier age to reduce stress engage 
in sexual activities at an earlier age and it naturally leads to 
higher rates of suicide 
a student committed suicide every nine days during the 198788 
school year in kansas and probably more than 1000 others tried he 
said 
early childhood stress also can result in health problems such 
as coronary heart disease obesity and mental illness 
our health behaviors are established by the time we are 18 and 
they are difficult to change lang said if a child is under 
stress at an early age more than likely he will continue to be 
throughout life 
educators agree that a cornerstone in dealing with the problems 
of early childhood stress is developing a students selfconcept or 
selfesteem 
we need to find ways at an early time in a childs life to 
give children a sense of belonging a sense of feeling good about 
themselves fitch said 
school districts need to keep class sizes down to provide for 
better communication between students and teachers the 
teachertostudent ratio needs to increase so kids can have an 
adult friend to turn to and schools need to put more emphasis on 
teaching parents about parenting she said sometimes parents 
dont realize what is happening with their children 
most of the 150 teachers who attended the conference last month 
were aware that their students were under stress but few had 
talked about it with other educators said lang who wrote lazy 
dogs and snoozing frogs quieting and relaxation activities for 
children after conducting the study in kansas 
we had them look at high dropout rates the fact that there 
are over 1 million teenage pregnancies a year the increasing rate 
of suicide and substance abuse he said 
we asked how does it all come together the answer was 
stress 
schools need to identify the problems of stress and look for 
longrange solutions lang said they should train students to cope 
with stress through breathing exercises maintaining a proper diet 
and increasing communication in addition stress is higher in 
schools without physical education classes which let students to 
blow off some steam 
people will always have stress in their lives he said 
its a part of living but what we need to do is train these kids 
how to handle the stress so they can live healthy and productive 
lives

benjamin franklin studied the gulf stream and 
pirates smugglers and whalers kept an eye on it but it took 
satellites and computers to realize the currents role in weather 
fishing and even submarine warfare 
the sweeping swirl of the gulf stream is 50 to 100 miles wide 
and less than a mile deep its born in the gulf of mexico and 
shinnies up the east coast to cape hatteras then shifts eastward 
to the grand banks and newfoundland swings over to europe and 
eventually returns those chilly waters to the sargasso sea 
on its way the gulf stream caused by the interplay between 
the earths rotation and winds driving the oceans survace moves 
not only warm water but nutrients this is important at least as 
far as fish are concerned since it makes the stream hospitable 
enough for fish to spend their lives in it 
the gulf stream is really clear and really dark and certain 
fish really like that said mitchell roffer who began studying 
the current 10 years ago for the national aeronautics and space 
administration and now uses soviet and us satellites in advising 
fishermen from puerto rico to nova scotia 
many fish like to congregate at the gulf streams edge where 
coastal waters run up along side and get mixed around said roffer 
whose miamibased service tells fishermen where these congregants 
are found on a given day 
the massive current was first identified in the 1500s by juan 
ponce deleon who discovered florida in the days when sea lanes 
were the only way across the atlantic ships destroyed by storms 
drifted with the stream navigators drafted charts noting the 
drifting wrecks they didnt know it but they were charting the 
route of the gulf stream current that swept the wrecks along but 
it wasnt until the 18th century that the gulf stream made its way 
onto a map 
the most famous effort to identify the gulf stream was 
undertaken in the 1770s by franklin then a shipping agent in 
philadelphia with the help of his cousin timothy folger a whaler 
from nantucket franklins interest was sparked by complaints from 
colonists that mail took a couple weeks longer to come from europe 
than it did when sent east riding the stream part of the way 
computers and satellites are finally unlocking the secrets of 
the current 
its the first part of the ocean we actually are 
forecasting said scott glenn an oceanographer in harvard 
universitys department of earth and planetary sciences who helped 
allan robinson develop the harvard gulfcast the first ocean 
forecasting system to predict the streams daily variations 
people have been making models of the gulf stream but this is 
the first time they have been applied to forecasting glenn said 
financed by the navy for use with submarines the gulfcast is 
also of interest to shipping companies looking for a fast ride 
meteorologists trying to get a grip on the atmosphere and even 
pleasure boaters the navys specific interest is in the warm 
fronts where temperature differentials play havoc with the 
underwater acoustics used by submarine detectors 
william macleish former editor of oceanus magazine and author 
of the book the gulf stream encounters with the blue god 
said the current makes it possible for you and me to have a 
fairly decent existence 
the gulf stream is part of the circulation of the whole 
ocean said oceanographer carl wunsch of the massachusetts 
institute of technology it transports heat from near the 
equator toward the polar regions it makes the midlatitudes of the 
earth habitable 
we have a much milder winter than they have in kansas because 
were close to a water system that stores a lot of heat 
those who study global warming are checking out the gulf stream 
too one theory holds that if subpolar warming becomes too great 
the stream will weaken because a smaller difference in temperature 
lowers the velocity of the streams engine europe would chill out 
as a result another theory predicts the warming will expand the 
already warm sargasso sea westerlies would move that warmed air to 
europe and turn the continent into a steam bath 
take your choice macleish said we are living in great 
peril

the sky is black and the stars are 
shining brightly above mcdonald observatory but a faint glow can 
be spotted from the lights of alpine 26 miles east on the far side 
of the davis mountains 
aurora commercialis robert scheppler calls the lights 
but thanks to cooperative neighbors good location and a dry 
climate mcdonald observatory suffers from much less of this light 
pollution than most major us observatories said scheppler the 
chief of visitor services 
the observatory gets along very well with its neighbors the 
authorities in those towns really try to cooperate with us 
the observatory has persuaded local governments to install 
street lights that create less problems fort davis high school 
which began night football games only after a 1985 law discouraged 
day games to keep sports and classroom time from overlapping turns 
off its stadium lights promptly after games and a bill before the 
legislature that would let local officials regulate outdoor 
lighting without it counties can pass ordinances but not enforce 
them 
of the existing observatories were the darkest said jeff 
davis county judge ann scudday everyone in this area benefits 
from the observatory as far as tourism in addition just about 
everyone in the town of 900 knows someone who works at the 
observatory 
when youre this small you have to try to get along said 
school board president kimball miller you know people as 
people 
the countrys bestknown observatories palomar near san diego 
and kitt peak near tucson ariz dont have the advantage of 
smalltown relations said scheppler both have to deal with many 
surrounding communities to limit light 
it can be dark but when you talk about how much light is 
scientifically debilitating you run into problems long before most 
people would think theres a problem scheppler said 
much of mcdonalds work involves spectroscopy and the spectrum 
viewed by the telescopes isnt continous some colors are brighter 
than normal and others are missing the missing colors are 
identified by absorption lines which reveal the composition of 
a stars atmosphere and stellar temperature motion relative to the 
earth and rotation among other things 
light is just packed with information our eyes just dont pick 
out he said the difference between what you can see when you 
look at the star with your eyes and opening up its spectrum is the 
difference between looking at the shadow of a book on the ground 
and opening it up and reading it 
mcdonald observatory is in an almost ideal place for such 
studies its at the top of 6800foot mount locke where the air 
is clear and stable it seldom rains and mountains block most light 
from fort davis marfa and alpine 
but some of the light does pollute the sky and astronomers are 
especially hampered by mercuryvapor lamps and lights that point up 
mercuryvapor lamps are the bluishgreen streetlights common in 
most cities and towns astronomers would prefer to see them 
exchanged for lowpressure sodium lamps that cast a peachy or 
yellowish light 
mercuryvapor lamps produce lots of absorption lines so its 
like looking at the spectrum through a picket fence scheppler 
said sodium lamps have fewer absorption lines like looking 
through a twoslat picket fence 
the bill before the legislature would let local governments near 
major observatories mandate the use of lowpressure sodium lights 
and hoods to keep lights from shining into the night sky 
unhooded lights and billboard lamps arent a problem around 
mcdonald scheppler said the biggest potential culprit is the 
stadium lighting at fort davis high but officials are 
conscientious about its use and its only about three hours a 
night four or five nights a year so its not a big problem 
surrounding cities still use a few mercuryvapor lamps jeff 
davis county plans to switch to sodium this spring alpine which 
creates most of the light pollution seen at mcdonald observatory 
has replaced about 200 mercuryvapor lamps with sodium lights and 
will replace the rest as they burn out 
we dont have a lot of light pollution today said jb 
tabor manager of west texas utilities in alpine what were 
really trying to do is prevent it in the future

as treatment of animals goes beyond neutering the 
family cat and deworming the dog veterinarians face ethics 
questions like physicians do 
should fido be put to sleep does bossie the cow deserve more 
respect is the health of a race horse more important than the 
owners bottom line 
the vet serves both the animal and the human community and is 
caught in the middle said jerrold tannenbaum who teaches 
veterinary law and ethics at the tufts school of veterinary 
medicine in boston and north grafton 
tannenbaum 43 has offered guidelines for puzzling out 
solutions to animal lifeanddeath questions in his new book 
veterinary ethics 
such questions stem in part from a growing appreciation of the 
place pets hold in owners livess certainly animals are not 
people but many people now regard pets as members of the family 
part of what were involved in here is the definition of these 
beings how high should they be regarded 
animals like people can now benefit from expensive treatments 
dogs can get pacemakers for 800 to 1000 and hip replacements 
costing upwards of 1000 cats undergo cancer chemotherapy for 
around 1000 
ethical issues arise when a vet is caught between advising the 
use of such care and a pet owner who cant afford or doesnt want 
to pay what it costs 
they also extend to other animals drugging thoroughbreds to 
make them go faster for example or feeding cows antibiotics and 
other drugs that put more meat on the table but could block 
symptoms of animal suffering

that have lived for eons beneath beach sand may provide fossilized 
clues that can help geologists locate valuable titanium deposits in 
the southeast 
igneous and metamorphic rocks that form the piedmont area and 
blue ridge mountains contain traces of titaniumrich heavy 
minerals as the rocks weather into sand and clay particles are 
carried down rivers and deposited along the coast waves and 
currents sort the particles by size and density depositing the 
heavy minerals on some parts of the beach 
the ghost shrimp that im studying appears to be almost 
restricted to the beaches and the heavy minerals are accumulating 
on the beaches said geologist gale bishop if we can identify 
burrows of that species in the past we should be able to find 
heavy mineral deposits 
heavy minerals like rutile and ilmenite contain titanium a 
strong light metal used by the space industry titanium oxide 
whitens paints and papers 
bishop of georgia southern college is pumping up ghost shrimp 
from beaches along the coast and recording their distribution 
shapes size and claw types the shrimp are seldom seen living out 
their lives deep in sandy burrows and feeding on organic debris 
bacteria and nutrients filtered from the water 
what we hope to see is the upper part of the burrow the 
vertical shaft which would indicate were near the sealevel of the 
past it might indicate heavy mineral deposits nearby bishop 
said the similarity of geological conditions in the 
carolinas georgia and northern florida should indicate that heavy 
mineral deposits could be found in any of these areas

james alleman has encountered more 
than the notinmybackyard syndrome in trying to deal with 
sewage sludge people who hear of his biobricks generally say 
not in my wall 
the environmental engineer worked with a maryland manufacturer 
to make bricks that have been used in two park shelters in 
washington dc and two sewage treatment plants for the 
washington suburban sanitary commission 
more recently hes discovered that even sludge laden with 
hazardous metals can be put into the claysludge mixture that is 
fired into bricks alleman has been unable to extract the metal 
except with the strongest acids 
we soaked them in an acid solution to simulate acid rain and 
we couldnt get the metals back out we had such a hard time we had 
to dissolve the bricks we had to use hydroflouric acid the 
strongest acid we have he said 
of course if builders have an aversion to bricks made with 
normal sludge theyre even less likely to use bricks made with 
hazardous metals like nickel arsenic cadmium chrome and lead 
no matter how safe they are 
theres a lot of inorganic sludge with hazardous wastes in it 
you cant put it on farmers lands because the crops would be 
contaminated with it alleman said those kinds of sludge are 
ideal candidates for bricks 
he estimated that american cities dispose of 6000 to 10000 
tons of sludge a day some bury it others burn it and a few still 
dump it in the ocean 
the key to allemans process is the brickmaking kiln which 
operates at 2000 degrees over two days to bake the 5050 mixture 
of clay and sludge into bricks in the process any organic matter 
in the sludge is burned away and any hazardous metals are fused 
permanently into the brick 
if i were a brick manufacturer i would find somebody to pay 
me to take sludge off their hands its easy you need very hose work is 
funded in part 
by the national science foundation

the north american waterfowl management plan a 15 billion 
united states canadian effort to restore dwindling duck 
populations in the us could receive the blessing of congress 
this year 
it would give legal sanction and possibly legal tender to the 
plan signed by the interior secretaries of the two countries in 
may 1986 
the proposed legislation by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine is the most encouraging thing thats happened 
involving the plan said charles h collins executive director of 
the national fish and wildlife foundation the group charged with 
implementing the us part of the plan 
mitchell pledged he would introduce the north american 
wetlands conservation act in april 
a primary goal of the legislation would be to halt the decline 
of many species of ducks geese and other migratory birds through 
the implementation of the north american waterfowl management 
plan mitchell said 
the legislation calls for spending 25 to 30 million a year to 
cover washingtons share of costs in the 15year plan 
ducks unlimited has pledged nearly 500 million over the life of 
the plan 
the canadian government and provinces have pledged more 
millions and the states are beginning to make contributions 
meanwhile a first series of projects under the plan is being 
realized and a second series is on the drawing boards 
ducks unlimited and the nature conservancy both private groups 
have signed a preliminary agreement to acquire and improve 
waterfowl habitat 
they are particularly talented in acquiring the land and we 
have special expertise in the management of land and water said 
matt connolly executive vice president of du working together 
we can be a lot more effective 
the partnership has started four projects one in each of the 
major duck flyways 
they are located at central cheyenne bottoms kansas the major 
inland staging area for shorebirds on the north american continent 
bodcau bayou in louisiana ace basin near charleston se and the 
cosumnes river drainage the last undammed river in california the 
latter is a major wintering area for tundra swans cranes pintails 
and snow geese said connolly chairman of the north american 
plans implementation board representing conservation fisheries 
and forestry groups 
i believe private sector as shown by the groups on the board 
is working together the fruits of our labors are beginning to 
show the quill lakes project in saskatchewan is about to be 
baptized 
that project a firststep project under the plan involved 
acquiring land building wetlands and protecting upland habitat for 
ducks the area is getting its first drenching of rain and snow 
this spring 
connolly said he was worried despite coordinated efforts in 
spending 93 million on secondstep projects under the north 
american plan one of my concerns is when we start getting 50 
million or 60 million then the occasional slippages of the bad 
side of humanity will come out 
the group he said is not ready to handle that kind of money 
because there are no formal agreements and criteria 
in three years we have come a very long way he said but 
if we were fortunate to have someone give us 100 million right 
now we dont have the infrastructure dont have the priorities 
identified to judiciously spend the money 
spending large sums of money across international borders often 
is a complicated business he said were learning a lot about 
dealing with governments dealing with land and ownership 
we are maturing he said

although there was enough snow on the prairie this winter to 
bring some hope for a recovery of the continents duck population 
theres little chance of a rebound this fall 
preliminary data from us fish and wildlife wing surveys this 
winter show reproduction last summer was poor to terrible the 
service says this falls hunting regulations probably will be as 
restrictive as those of last season 
part of it is so dry its going to take a lot of water to 
bring it back up to average said bob meeks regional operations 
supervisor at ducks unlimiteds great plains regional office the 
cover has to grow back 
wing receipts indicate that species like mallards pintails 
blue wings teal and even wood ducks have had a poor reproductive 
season explained rollin d sparrowe who oversees migratory 
birds for the us fish and wildlife service 
preliminary data show the harvest of pintails and mallards was 
cut sharply by last years restrictive regulations sparrowe said 
if in fact habitat improvement is better than early indications 
are this spring we hope there will be birds to take advantage of 
it 
his information paints a grim picture of duck populations 
for pintails last year in the pacific flyway there were only 50 
juveniles per 100 adults last year down from 85 juveniles per 100 
in 1987 and 100 juveniles per 100 adults in 1985 
biologists agree a healthy population is at least 150 juveniles 
per 100 adults the higher the better 
the ratio for mallards in the mississippi flyway was 89 
juveniles per 100 adults compared to 136 juveniles per 100 adults 
in 1987 the ratio for mallards in the central flyway was 53 
juveniles per 100 adults compared to 94 per 100 in 1987 
the atlantic flyway fared better with 168 juveniles per 100 
adults but down from a 21 ratio in 1987 
wood ducks in the mississippi flyway produced 126 young per 100 
adults down from 169 in 1987 and 216 in 1986 
thats the kind of thing we forecast and the reason we took 
strong restrictive action last year sparrowe said 
meeks said there have been good winter snows in large parts of 
the prairie country of minnesota the dakotas montana and the 
canadian prairie country but water accumulations from march to 
june this year will be critical 
in montana he said a lot of projects that weve been looking 
at never took a drop of water last year theyre already filled 
this year 
we have moisture for the first time but we do need a lot more 
to get to average conditions he said 
that means two things 
remaining snow has to run off over frost seal on the ground 
and into the ponds 
there has to be enough spring rain to restore ground water and 
soil moisture so ponds that fill in early spring dont dry out by 
summer 
then there must be vegetation 
there the conservation reserve program has helped in the united 
states meeks said 
many farmland tracts left idle last year have some scrub and 
stubble he said and thats a dang sight better than if they had 
been plowed over and were brown ground 
puddle ducks such as mallards have some chances to find nests 
which they typically build a half mile from water 
but canada didnt have that and thats where the bulk of the 
ducks come from he said 
areas that were ponds were dry and farmers plowed right through 
them 
overwater nesters such as canvasbacks need some type of 
cattail or other vegetation thats in a pothole to build a nest 
meeks said where thats been removed for whatever reason 
burning plowing theres nothing there for them they cant build 
nests 
those are the ones for which it will take the longest to 
recover from a drought when habitat around the pothole has been 
totally altered meeks said

for the traveler who feels more fear 
than freedom during a highspeed hurtle along west germanys 
infamous autobahns touring the rhine river valley on two wheels 
offers solace as well as scenery 
from the famous rock of lorelei where the legendary siren lured 
sailors to their deaths to the majestic twin towers of colognes 
14th century cathedral some of the renowned valleys most splendid 
sights are best reached and enjoyed from the seat of a bicycle 
the 800mile rhine river sweeps from the swiss alps to the dutch 
north sea coast it threads a gentle and inspiring path through the 
black forest centuriesold spas where european royalty once 
rested windmillstudded farmland and vineyards ripe with the scent 
of next falls riesling 
dozens of castles from jagged ruins to restored medieval 
estates that now offer lodging or riverfront dining dapple the 
hillsides flanking the flat winding paths along the rivers most 
popular and attractive stretch from mainz to the capital city of 
bonn 
the sport of cycling and combined exercise and travel have been 
booming over the past decade as west germans have become more 
concerned about their health and the environment 
two out of three west germans own a bicycle and sales of the 
twowheeled vehicles now run nearly double the volume of cars sold 
here according to adfc the national bicycling association that 
claims more than 25000 members 
dovetailing the surge in cycling interest among west germans and 
foreign tourists has been a corresponding growth of separate 
bicycle paths touring clubs guide services and repair shops that 
has helped make the endeavor safer and more accessible 
although there has been a sharp increase in the number of 
cyclists over the past few years the number of accidents and 
fatalities involving bicycles has been steadily decreasing said 
karlludwig kelber head of bonns adfc chapter 
the number of bicyclist fatalities dropped from 1142 in 1980 to 
730 in 1987 the last year for which statistics are available 
primarily because of the broader development of bike paths away 
from the heavily traveled highways in comparison there were more 
than 8000 auto fatalities in west germany last year 
despite the improved safety record and unique protections for 
cyclists including a federal law requiring cars to pass no closer 
than 5 feet a bicycling vacation is not for everyone 
the adfc and private touring services recommend that 
inexperienced cyclists avoid attempting long journeys without being 
accompanied by a professional guide 
travelers can arrange guided tours or individual itineraries 
with guide services that transport bikes to the starting point and 
carry baggage by minivan from one overnight stop to the next 
west german trains also transport bicycles for a nominal fee 
allowing travelers who choose to chart their own course to skip 
over some of the most polluted stretches of the river and the most 
heavily industrialized areas that scar the landscape 
food and lodging abound along the highly developed rhine and 
travelers can also arrange specialinterest bicycle trips such as a 
tour of the valleys numerous small wineries 
the adfc has collected and published a detailed twovolume 
guidebook to the rhine river bike paths covering the entire 
waterway from its headwaters near st gotthard switzerland to its 
delta outflow at hoek van holland 
the books which are published in german but contain notes and 
glossaries in english and dutch describe path conditions 
sightseeing opportunities hotel and restaurant facilities and the 
location of shops that rent bikes or repair them 
there are also recommendations on when to cross from one side of 
the northflowing river to the other making use of the more than 
100 bridges and ferries crossing the waterway to take the more 
scenic route or avoid antibicycle strongholds where cyclists 
are expected to dismount and walk 
general information about cycling in west germany and bike path 
maps of specific regions are available by mail from the adfcs 
national headquarters adfc postfach 107744 2800 bremen west 
germany 
but for detailed planning of a trip and information about group 
or guided tours the organization recommends cyclists contact a 
travel agent or the adfcs commercial tour operator velomobil at 
the bremen address

the smallmouth bass or bronzeback evolved primarily as a 
resident of the clear rivers and lakes of the northeast but they 
have been transplanted all over the country often sharing the same 
lakes if not quite the same habitat as their largemouth cousins 
to catch smallmouth fish smaller baits on necessarily lighter 
line said ken cook of meers okla cook is a fisheries biologist 
who has used his knowledge to become one of the top anglers on the 
tournament trail 
the lighter line doesnt weigh down the lighter lures and is 
harder for fish to see in the clearer water usually preferred by 
smallmouth bass 
the smallmouth cook said grows larger in southern waters than 
in its native habitat because the season for feeding and growing is 
longer they also grow larger in lakes than in rivers because in a 
river current causes fish to use a lot of growth energy 
surviving 
smallmouth and largemouth bass may be found in the same lake 
but look for the smallmouth in different areas than those where 
youll find his bigger cousin 
look for the clear part of the lake with deeper rockier 
shorelines cook said these fish tend to associate with those 
types of areas compared with the shallower muddy area preferred 
by the largemouth 
smallmouth tend to spawn in rocky flats often those with large 
boulders 
ideally the water will be clear enough that you can see the 
beds shiny spots on the bottom he said if i can see the 
fish i try to pick out the big ones you can pick out the one 
youre going to try to catch 
catching them is a matter of reading the fish and the pattern 
or situation theyre in sometimes its easy sometimes much more 
difficult he said 
my no 1 bait of choice would be a grub or another small piece 
of plastic you can put on the bed the fish will defend its 
territory from that intrusion 
the first pass may tell you whether you are going to catch that 
fish 
some of them leave and dont come back right away i dont 
figure those are going to be catchable cook said if the fish 
looks at the bait but doesnt hit it keep trying stay away from 
the bed and use long casts so you dont spook the fish 
if the fish hits on the first pass it could mean youre going 
to have a lot of fishing fun that day 
if the grub doesnt work cook will switch to a jerkbait or 
balsa minnow 
i use a bill norman baltic minnow in the brighter colors 
blue with an orange belly for example the fish tend to get mad at 
those colors it seems like they bite them cook said cast 
past the bed and reel down to the level where the fish are then 
jerk real hard so it thumps in the water 
get it close to the fish and let it float up that seems to 
anger the fish and theyll go for it 
if i cant catch that fish that way ill go look for another 
one cook said 
thats not too difficult he said because beds are often only 
20 or 30 feet apart hell note where big ones are hanging out and 
try for them again later 
after spawning smallmouth go off to deeper water and sulk 
theyre tired and theyre not really in such a good mood cook 
said they back off to a good safe area rocky or stumpy a 
breakline or a dropoff and theyll suspend off it 
hunger pangs eventually end the sulking and the fish swim out 
to deeper water looking for lunch 
they stay on offshore humps dropoffs some kind of offshore 
structure into the fall cook said 
fall is a peak feeding time and smallmouth work their way back 
inshore to take crawfish and a wide assortment of dinner items 
crawfish are a favorite but theyre like any other bass they 
eat whatever is the most available cook said i like to know 
whats most available 
cook won the 1987 bass anglers sportsman society new york 
invitational tournament at thousand islands by using lures to 
imitate emerald shiners and yellow perch the foods he felt the 
smallmouth were using there 
whatever you try he said keep lures small and fish lighter 
line if you want to catch smallmouth

the angler who is successful catching bass in a 
river system is the one who fishes the main river in the hottest 
weather but prowls the sloughs and backwaters the rest of the time 
according to george cochran of north little rock ark 
the only time i catch a lot of fish on the river itself is in 
the hottest part of the summer usually about june to august or 
september said cochran considered one of the best fishermen on 
the bass anglers sportsman society roster the rest of the year he 
looks to the backwaters and isnt above shoving an 18foot boat 
through 3 inches of water and 2 feet of muck to get there 
thats where they spend the winter thats where theyre 
spawning and a lot of them never leave that backwater never go 
out into that river he said in an interview 
for many bass however time to migrate to the main river comes 
when the backwater gets warm and stagnant 
if you decide to fish a backwater you want to find the 
largest backwater in the area where youre going to be fishing 
he said 
usually in rivers bass dont live any deeper than 5 feet 
theres an exception to every rule but 99 percent of the time bass 
dont live any deeper than 5 feet 
one exception to the 5foot rule is in exceptionally clear 
water where the fish will be living deeper he said 
so he uses lures that work at all depths in water to 5 feet 
deep or the top five feet of deeper water plastic worms 
spinnerbaits and fairly shallow diving or surface crankbaits 
in the main river three basic types of cover attract bass 
wood rocks and sand 
rivers are full of sand there are sandbar points and sandbar 
banks cochran explained bass hang out around this sand 
because the baitfish and shad cruise the sand they feed along 
those sandy banks ive noticed i catch more fish now than ever on 
those banks 
in addition to fallen trees or snags look for docks boat 
ramps old pilings boat houses or rockpile banks 
basically the same three baits work but i fish a lot of 
topwater baits because the fish will suspend they will be around 
the pilings or riprap but they will suspend over it 
a lot of times a topwater bait is the best for the first two 
or three hours in the morning and the last two or three hours in 
the evening and you can use crankbaits or worms though the day 
cochran said 
spring is the best time to fish the backwaters because most 
rivers are dingy or dirty at that time of year and bass are 
spawning in the backwaters 
i look for the biggest backwater that is clear cochran 
said the bass will get as far away from that river as they can 
looking for clear still water in which to spawn 
i look for little ponds sloughs even if you have to get out 
and push and shove you can get into some real good areas he 
said he uses the same baits but plastic worms usually work the 
best standard colors black and blue 
when they spawn you can see the fins on their backs out of 
the river they get so shallow its unbelievable he said a 
lot of times you can see the water muddying up like a carp around 
the bank but it will be the bass 
he recommended using brightly colored spinnerbaits such as 
yellow or chartreuse on backwaters in early spring

walleye fishing is one of the fastestgrowing outdoor sports 
and bob kaczkowski believes the toothy cousin of the perch may be 
the most soughtafter catch in the country in the 21st century 
the walleye is a northern river fish which has been transplanted 
as far south as louisiana and to the west side of the rockies 
i predict in the next 10 years almost nationwide walleye 
fishing is going to be it all the way from new york to the state 
of washington its going bonkers said kaczkowski who is an 
avid walleye angler and executive director of the franklin 
wisbased manufacturers walleye council which operates the 
nations major walleye tournament circuit 
while walleye can be caught all year even through the ice in 
winter spring is when the fishing really can get good 
with spring walleye often its feast or famine said 
kaczkowski it sometimes seems like your fishing for nothing for 
hours on end then in 20 minutes two of you can have limits 
they always school tight usually if you find one youre 
going to find a ton of them spring fishing is very very 
rewarding 
there are two groups of walleyes those which spawn in rivers 
and those confined to lakes 
the walleye run begins in fall as the fish move to staging 
areas in the deepest holes they can find 
the action begins when the water warms up to 45 degrees and 
since rivers warm up sooner than lakes it begins there first then 
the lake walleyes that head upriver to spawn make their move 
in the lakes there are two types of walleyes those that spawn 
in shallow water up against the bank and those that use offshore 
points humps or bars as spawning areas the shoreline spawners get 
active first 
spawning actually begins when females join the males in very 
shallow water usually between midnight and dawn and the males 
prod the females into dropping her eggs then they fertilize them 
the best way to catch spawning walleye is with a leadhead jig 
tipped with a minnow kaczkowski said 
its critical the fisherman match the current speed and depth 
of water with the weight of the jig you dont want to be jigging 
and have the thing swept right down the stream because no 
selfrespecting walleye is going to chase it downriver after hes 
just swum 10 miles upriver he said you want it heavy enough 
so that when you lift if off the bottom it just eases downstream a 
little bit 
another method is the wolf river rig named after the famous 
walleye river in wisconsin there are many local variations but 
its basically a threeeye swivel with a sinker on light line 
attached to one eye a leader with a minnow attached to the second 
and the anglers line tied to the third 
it keeps the minnow swimming just off the bottom in the current 
kaczkowski said a third trick is the slip bobber with a minnow 
hanging below allow the wind or current to carry the bobber and 
minnow into snags or swampy areas where its difficult to cast a 
lure you can adjust your bait to any depth below the bobber 
trolling lures or nightcrawlers also are popular particularly 
on big lakes such as walleyerich lake erie 
in the spring that means using small minnows because natural 
wild minnows are small 
even big walleye i mean 10pound walleye often prefer 
those smaller minnows in the spring kaczkowski said when i go 
out in the spring walleye fishing i always take two or three sizes 
of minnows because if you buy a couple dozen and they are all the 
same size and the fish dont want them then what 
while the overwhelming choice of bait in the spring is the 
minnow sometimes when the fish are aggressive half a 
nightcrawler a teaser just enough to cover the hook portion of 
the jig also works he said later theyll go for small 
whole crawlers and leaches 
artificial bait specialists should use small stickbaits such as 
rapalas 
when theyre shallow you can get them on a stickbait or 
anything with a tight wobble anything that has too much of a 
wobble is not attractive to walleye kaczkowski said 
the tournament circuit he said has debunked the idea that 
walleye are only caught at night 
ive had a lot of success between 9 am and noon and during 
the midafternoon hours kaczkowski said on the manufacturers 
walleye council circuit we have found out based on the experience 
of 3025 fishermen last year most of our walleyes are caught 
between 11 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon and the bigger 
fish have come on very hot bright days 
believe it or not the largest fish caught on our circuit a 
12 pounder was caught at noon in 3 feet of water on a midlake 
hump

keep fish alive in your boat with clean cool 
water oxygen and chemical treatment to calm the fish and help 
them recover from injuries including the touch of your hands 
about the most important thing is the way you handle the fish 
in the first place said tony gergley vice president of jungle 
laboratories corp which has been studying ways to keep fish alive 
in aquariums and livewells 
use heavy enough tackle in the first place to bring the fish 
in without exhausting it and then be careful handling it when you 
take the hook out he said in an interview from his cibolo 
texas office we dont recommend the use of nets although i 
know a lot of people use them but they can tear up a fish too bad 
can hurt them too much 
gergley and the bass anglers sportsman society ran an experiment 
at major bassmaster tournaments last year and we did not lose a 
fish he said 
livewells in boats were treated with catch and release made by 
jungle laboratories and water inside was cooled with ice 
catch and release is a tranquilizer and water conditioner it 
also adds electrolytes to water to restore them to the fish 
the water treatment also stimulates slime protection by fish 
when a fish is stressed by being caught and handled the cells 
which produce slime clamp up gergley said taking off the 
slime is like taking the skin off a human you are going to get 
infection 
lower the water temperature in the livewell about 15 degrees 
from lake water temperature 
in a goodsized livewell five to eight pounds of ice at one 
time will not hurt your fish gergley said i think they will 
love you for it 
the best way to monitor water temperature is to put an aquarium 
thermometer in the livewell he said the experiments with bass he 
added disproved the old wives tale that you cant drop 
temperature on bass or it will kill them 
finally make sure the water in the livewell is clean if you 
get your boat in very shallow water and the pump sucks mud into the 
livewell change the water even if it means you have to dip it out 
its less harmful to the fish to change the water and leave 
them out of water for a minute or two than to leave them in dirty 
water he said 
new boats he said have aeration and recirculating systems in 
livewells making the livewells inboat aquariums older livewells 
circulate water from below the boat into the livewell 
by keeping your fish alive you can return to the water those 
you dont need for a tournament or dont want for dinner they can 
grow and be caught another time

when it comes to hiking in the southeast north carolina wants 
you to think of north carolina 
hiking trails in the tar heel state are used more than any other 
trails in the nation according to the us forest service more 
than 500000 recreation visitor days are recorded each year 
hiking is one of our key trail activities says melinda 
waldrep trail specialist and landscape architect for the us 
forest service in asheville nc our area is unique because of 
our waterfalls rock features and because the southern appalachians 
have the largest number of plant species in the world 
national park land in the state includes the great smoky 
mountains national park with 900 miles of maintained hiking 
trails the nantahala national forest and the pisgah national 
forest 
travelers who are unfamiliar with the area can take day or 
halfday hiking trips with the sierra club or the carolina mountain 
club or they can try unguided but wellmarked trails inside local 
private parks such as chimney rock in lake lure 25 miles southeast 
of asheville or grandfather mountain the highest peak in the blue 
ridge range at 5964 feet 
the carolina mountain club publishes a guide 100 favorite 
trails of the great smokies and carolina blue ridge written by 
club member bernard elias the club has conducted more than 6000 
hiking trips around asheville since it was established in 1931 
there is an interesting companionship that develops on a hike 
with a group from this area says elias its a good way to get 
to talk to each other away from the distractions of city life you 
get a feeling of closeness with the wonders of nature and a real 
appreciation of life 
some of the trails recommended by elias include 
the mountains to the sea trail part of a 750mile path that 
will eventually stretch between the smoky mountains and the eastern 
coast of north carolina the trail surrounded by thick green 
forests is open for the first time this year 
the shutin trail a 16mile trail running parallel to the

every year thousands of tourists roam 
through north carolinas mountains on trails that range from short 
legstretchers along the blue ridge parkway to longdistance 
treks through the remote wilderness 
some end up lost others with injuries that run from sprains to 
broken legs a few die from falls exposure or overexertion 
here are some tips from experts on hiking in the mountains 
pick the right clothes wear hiking boots or a good pair of 
sneakers with deep tread heavy socks and loosefitting 
longlegged pants a tshirt is fine in moderate weather but carry 
a sweater or wind breaker that can be tied around the waist and 
take a hat even if its just a baseball cap add more clothing as 
the weather becomes more extreme 
wearing a pair of thin nylon socks with hiking boots is about 
like going barefoot said jeff wahoo stanley owner of wahoos 
outdoor adventures in boone weve found that some of the best 
pants for hiking are just ordinary sweatpants the kind with a 
drawstring waist they protect your legs but theyre comfortable 
and warm 
carry a minimum amount of equipment anyone going into the 
woods even on a short hike should carry a pocket knife a 
cigarette lighter water and a few firstaid supplies a small 
daypack can hold lunches and enough supplies for several people 
choose the right trail steep rugged trails might be fine for 
an experienced 30yearold hiker but a 6yearold or novice hiker 
doesnt need that much of a challenge check with outfitters or 
other local experts about available trails their degree of 
difficulty and hazards 
make sure someone knows where you are always tell someone 
what trail you intend to take and your estimated return time 
never hike alone the worst thing you can do is go out by 
yourself because you never know what can happen said tom collins 
of the watauga county emergency management office you get bitten 
by a snake turn an ankle or take a fall and youre just out there 
on your own until somebody happens to come across you 
do not leave the trail heavy foliage in the mountains 
sometimes hides sheer drops and taking a shortcut on a trail that 
winds back and forth on a mountainside can lead to erosion and 
other ecological damage 
dont panic if you lose your way stop and think before 
taking action following a stream downstream will eventually lead 
to a road or a place where you can get help if darkness is 
falling stay where you are for the night wandering around in the 
darkness can lead to a fall wait for daylight and make your way 
back to the trail

the turkey is too magnificent a bird to be 
shot at 100 yards with a rifle declared james earl kennamer 
hes got to be called within shotgun range said kennamer 
director of research and management for the national wild turkey 
federation a moving force behind the recovery of the wild turkey 
in north america 
he then proceeded to demonstrate calling two toms and at least 
two hens within 55 yards using a box call slate call and mouth 
call the birds however stayed about 15 yards outside the range 
of shotguns loaded with no 6 shot and lived to thrill other 
hunters with their earrattling gobbles 
a turkey gobbles to tell hens where he is and to call them to 
him 
a turkey hunter calls like a hen trying to seduce the gobbler 
to abandon his waiting and come to her 
any hunter can learn to use calls kennamer said the box 
call is the easiest to learn and you start with that 
but calling is overrated its important but you dont have 
to be a world class caller to hunt turkeys he said good 
woodsmanship is vital to kill turkeys 
the woodsmanship starts with quiet and ends with invisibility 
youve got to be quiet enough to get close enough to birds to 
call them without them hearing you and a turkeys hearing is 
acute kennamer said 
camouflage yourself from head to toe making sure there are no 
gaps allowing some white skin on a wrist a ring or the flash of a 
belt buckle to betray you to a turkey 
a turkey can see you blink while he is outside gun range 
kennamer said you must not only be camouflaged you must not 
move a muscle while that turkey is in a position where he can see 
you 
a turkeys head is red white and blue as a safety precaution 
kennamer stressed dont wear any of those colors when in the woods 
during turkey season because you may become the target for a 
careless hunter 
a hunters calls are similar to musical instruments and in the 
hands of an expert caller become exactly that 
the first call is the box call a rectangular box with a top 
which slides across the sides imitating the yelp gobble and other 
calls 
the box call carries further in the woods than any other 
call kennamer said 
he has had his current box call 17 years he occasionally 
smooths the underside of the top with very fine sandpaper and 
frequently chalks it with soft builders chalk when the top slides 
across the side of the box the box resonates like a violin 
next is the slate call a slab of rock or other hard material 
also in box form the shell of a box turtle makes an excellent 
slate call he said it is played by rubbing a strike across the 
surface many strikers today are made of plastic or acrylic 
kennamer sands the surface of his slate with ultrafine sandpaper 
and draws the striker across the sanded area to imitate the 
turkeys putts and purrs 
both have a major drawback they must be worked in the hunters 
hands and the movement can give away his position to a gobbler 
the birds vision is many times better than a humans 
the answer is the mouth call its the most difficult to master 
but it can be used without any giveaway movement 
about the size of a halfdollar with part cut away the mouth 
call is a reed instrument like a clarinet or saxophone pressed 
against the roof of the mouth it is played by forcing air across 
its reeds 
some people have trouble with a gagging reaction in keeping 
the call in their mouths kennamer said but it can be overcome 
with a little practice 
to carry his gear kennamer wears a vest with zipped pouches 
i lost one of my favorite calls when it fell out of a pocket 
when i was crossing a stream he said 
he also has room for a snack two compasses snakebite kit crow 
call owl call small firstaid kit and some tissues a cushion 
attaches to the bottom of the vest 
the cushion can be vital to the hunter who has to sit motionless 
at the base of a tree for several hours seducing a turkey 
picking the right tree is important kennamer stressed 
its got to be wide enough to cover your silhouette 
completely he said make sure there are no branches or brush 
that will move if you bump them with your gun as you line up your 
shot a turkey will see that branch move even if you have stopped 
the ideal hunt starts the previous night tracking a gobbler to 
his roost at sunset use an owl call to get him to gobble then 
follow the sound 
set up within 100 to 150 yards of that tree before dawn once 
the turkey gobbles and flies down start making alluring sounds 
with your calls 
if you have to reach for your gun do it when his head is behind 
a tree or other object and he cant see you point it at where you 
think he will reappear and freeze 
with no 6 shot dont even think of a shot outside 40 yards 
aim for the head and neck for a clean kill aiming for the body 
probably will mean a wounded bird that dies later

the us fish and wildlife service plans to create the countrys 
first land refuge for a sea creature 
it will give loggerhead sea turtles a safe place to nest and for 
their young to hatch the proposed refuge would include segments of 
a 20mile beach at the brevardindian river county line on 
floridas atlantic coast 
about 25 percent of the loggerhead turtles on the east coast of 
the united states nest on that one stretch of beach 
i think weve got one last opportunity to protect the second 
most important nesting beach for loggerheads in the world said 
earl e possardt southeastern sea turtle coordinator for the us 
fish and wildlife service jacksonville fla 
theres some development down there now but we can make a 
difference in the longterm protection of that population weve 
got one last chance 
the largest nesting population is in oman on the gulf of hormuz 
center of the worlds oil tanker traffic and target of attacks 
during the iraniraq war said marydele donelly director of the 
washingtonbased turtle rescue fund their safety is not assured 
loggerhead turtles at one time nested from the florida keys to 
north carolina those remaining account for 30 percent of the world 
population of loggerheads 
were talking in the range of 10000 to 12000 turtles a year 
and weve seen a steady decline in the loggerhead population in 
some areas its a very dramatic decline as in south carolina 
she said 
this is the last large concentration she said although 
there is a lot of nesting further south in broward county fort 
lauderdale whos to say what kind of nesting theyd have if they 
didnt have a developed beach 
the state of florida plans to create a park in the area 
protecting 4 miles of beach acquisition of the first acreage 
could begin this year 
the federal program has much further to go the concept has been 
approved by former fws director frank dunkle but now the service 
must prepare an environmental assessment and investigate 
alternatives including land purchases 
if land purchases are the alternative the service will begin 
seeking money from congress to buy valuable highpriced oceanfront 
property with an estimated pricetag of 90 million 
four segments of land totaling 93 miles of beach and about 500 
acres of sand have been identified for protection the refuge would 
be only 100 to 200 yards deep extending from the mean high water 
line to florida a1a 
each year about 10000 to 12000 nests are dug in the area a 
few are endangered leatherback turtle nests and there are several 
hundred green turtle nests the rest are loggerheads 
there is no record to show how many sea turtles once nested in 
the southeast but we can see trends possardt said 
south carolina and georgia are showing declining trends in 
nesting and theres some indication in florida theres a slight 
decline 
the refuge he said would at least provide core areas that 
are relatively protected from development to assure that the 
turtles are protected too

greg marshall wants an alligators eye view of its world so 
hes working on a camera that alligators or other types of large 
sea dwellers can haul down into their world to give scientists an 
idea of how they live 
we hardly know anything about many animals underwater 
behavior marshall said take sea turtles we know what they do 
on the beaches when they nest we have some ideas from incidental 
observations what they do in the nesting areas but generally we 
dont know what these animals actually do how they interact with 
their environment 
its very basic biology marshall said 
he said he got the idea for the camcorder system while working 
in central america and seeing sharks being escorted by ramora fish 
i thought wouldnt it be interesting to be dragged along by 
a shark all day just to see what it does he said so he began 
assembling pieces for a system that can be attached to any animal 
larger than a juvenile sea turtle 
there is interest in his project from biologists studying a 
variety of animals from alligators to antarctic seals 
i think there may be a possibility of applying this method to 
studying whales marshall said 
his problem is taking offtheshelf equipment modifying it 
then building a housing that will protect the camera from the 
tremendous water pressure encountered by deepdiving animals 
what ive done is build a custom fiberglass housing which 
ive tested to about 1000 pounds pressure per square inch which 
is about 2000 feet depth he said 
the other problem is timing 
the camcorder has a life of about two hours the amount of 
tape in one cassette 
one idea is a mercury switch for cameras on sea turtles which 
will leave the camera off until it dives then switch on to record 
what the turtle does while its on the bottom 
it may take several weeks to fill the cassette he plans to 
develop a harness that will decay in that time with the rig 
floating to the surface 
then a radio will send a signal to scientists to pick it up 
it sees what the eye sees if you have 6foot visibility 
thats what it will see marshall said in terms of visual 
impact it would be much more interesting to be in nice clear 
waters but in terms of biology it really doesnt matter 
assuming youre working with an animal thats visually 
oriented which a lot of animals are he said the camera shows 
how those animals are behaving in the water in which theyre only 
able to see 5 feet or 3 feet how exactly they are orienting 
themselves under those conditions 
almost any image is going to be interesting

the book is out with an emphatic yes to the question 
are there still big ones out there 
nine new world record trophies are among 54 new topten listings 
in records of north american big game published by the boone 
and crockett club 
the records underscore the terrific job wildlife management is 
doing said william h nesbitt executive director of the boone 
and crockett club founded by president theodore roosevelt and a 
group of sportsmen in december 1887 
people are talking about the gene pool deteriorating and other 
things thats hogwash as judged by these trophies there are big 
ones out there and they are being taken nesbitt said 
its scoring system is accepted for ranking trophies of 31 
species of animals ranging from the walrus to the canada moose 
whitetail deer remains the largest category 
the book lists 1274 whitetail deer which meet the clubs 
standards as a superior trophy hunters in the united states killed 
about 5 million whitetail deer last season 
the category also lists the most impressive new trophies 
both the new record nontypical whitetail and the no 2 greatly 
exceeded the previous worlds record an animal killed by jeff 
benson near brady texas in 1892 it scored 286 on the b amp c scale 
the new world record is 333 78 and the no 2 is 328 28 
both exceeded the previous record by 40 points thats 
phenomenal nesbitt said in an interview 
the new record was found in st louis county mo in 1981 the 
no 2 trophy known as the hole in the horn buck because there 
is a hole in one antler where a bullet passed through was found in 
portage county ohio in 1940 
other new records are for columbia blacktail deer canada moose 
pronghorn grizzly and cougar the book also includes three new 
species central canada barren ground caribou roosevelts elk and 
sitka blacktail deer 
boone and crockett scoring is based on antler or horn length for 
such animals and skull measurements for others such as bear and 
cougar weight is not a factor 
records of north american big game is published every six 
years the current edition published last december is the ninth 
edition 
this edition is the first to be computer verified 
we did an extensive reverification of all the trophy data that 
was in the 1981 records book we recomputed the scores and checked 
for such things as excessive spread penalty nesbitt said we 
ended up with about a 5 percent error rate in the previous book 
and all those were corrected this is the most accurate most 
authenticated records book ever with the lowest possible margin of 
error 
some top10 trophies were removed from their accustomed places 
in the 1981 book some trophies were listed with an asterisk 
meaning they had not been verified by a final judging panel 
we took all the asterisk trophies and took their ranking away 
from them and put them at the bottom of the list until they had 
been before a judges panel nesbitt said it freshened up the 
top of the list particularly for the quebeclabrador caribou 
people who have followed the book for years are going to miss 
seeing some of the trophies there 
the book also reflects several minor scoring changes 
the most significant is dropping the socalled double penalty 
in the antlered categories where there is an excessive inside 
spread meaning the rack is wider than the length of the longest 
antler 
previous rules limited inside spread credit to the length of the 
longest antler then penalized the trophy for the difference the 
new rules drop the penalty 
the book has a history of trophy measuring stories about world 
records leaders in american conservation and the clubs theodore 
roosevelt memorial ranch in montana where the club is carrying out 
research to help ranchers produce both livestock and big game on 
their land 
thats important because most recreational hunting lands are 
in private hands today nesbitt said 
the book includes instructions on scoring so any hunter can 
compare his best trophy with the world record 
illustrated with both black and white and color pictures 
records of north american big game sells for 4995 plus 2 
handling from the boone and crockett club 241 south fraley blvd

safer travel may be ensured by equipping travel trailers and 
other vehicles properly especially with efficient hitches and 
electrical hookups 
a quality hitch properly suited for the trailer tongue weight 
and your particular automobile is a necessity says steve 
cochran agricultural engineer with the texas agricultural 
extension service 
universaltype hitches cannot always be adapted to all 
automobiles cochran says heavy duty shock absorbers or 
springs may have to be installed on the car if the trailer tongue 
weight exceeds towing specifications transmission coolers and 
external electric fan cooling devices can be used to supplement 
standard engine cooling fans 
to compensate for the extra electrical load a trailer adds he 
says add a heavy duty flasher to the turn signal and emergency 
flashers 
extra wiring presents a need for a quality trailer plug to 
make the added electrical load compatible with your car cochran 
says a 6connector plug allows for tail lignts left and right 
turn signals stop lights backup lights and a ground if the 
trailer has brakes a 7 or 8 plug is needed 
a trailers added weight and length calls for extra equipment 
and safety precautions to ensure a safe trip 
extra length side mirrors may have to be added to the towing 
vehicle for good rear vision cochran says wide angle mirrors 
used in conjunction with standard mirrors are best for covering 
blind spots 
in loading a trailer cochran suggests placing 60 percent of the 
total weight in front of the trailer axle to provide maximum 
stability and adding extra air in the tires to reduce side sway 
and overheating 
the added weight and length of a trailer alters driving 
conditions he says passing calls for at least doubling the space 
and time normally needed he cautioned against oversteer when 
making lane changes or the trailer will sway or whip 
lightly pumping the brakes when stopping can prevent them from 
overheating due to the extra load cochran says adding 
by following these suggestions your pace will be more 
leisurely the drive smoother and safer and your family will have 
a better chance to enjoy the scenery

try this for your next college outing the summit of chimborazo 
in the ecuadorean andes at 20703 feet the highest peak in north 
america 
a cornell university group made a successful ascent of 
chimborazo in december as part of the schools outdoor education 
program 
led by dan tillemans director of cornells outdoor education 
program the groups four rope teams climbed the summit in nine 
hours starting from a base camp at 15000 feet 
adjusting to thinning oxygen above 18000 feet was the most 
difficult part the climbers say 
some people took one step for every three breaths because 
theres so little oxygen up there says tillemans when we got 
there some people were too tired even to take pictures 
tillemans planted a red and white cornell banner at the summit 
the group made three ascents during their trip ruminahui at 
15455 feet was regarded as a practice climb it also climbed 
cotapaxi 19348 feet before taking on chimborazo 
the climb to chimborazo began at midnight to take advantage of 
calmer conditions though temperatures dropped to about 20 degrees 
at night during the day temperatures warmed to about 50 degrees 
and the most serious risk wasnt frostbite but sunburn the wind 
blew fiercely at the summits the climbers say 
tillemans says the andes views are breathtaking while climbing 
over the catapaxi glacier at night he watched lightning storms in 
the clouds below him

not all women of a certain age want to 
spend their vacations frying on the beach or sightseeing through 
the windows of an airconditioned car 
some like more challenge riding a packhorse through yellowstone 
or the grand canyon trekking through the blue ridge mountains 
with a llama to carry gear white water rafting on the colorado 
riding a horse in ireland or a camel in kenya 
travel packager susan eckert started her rainbow adventures with 
these women in mind organizing outings they would be unlikely to 
arrange on their own she limits her tours to women over 30 
many women in this age group never have had an opportunity for 
this kind of activity eckert says theyre also reluctant to go 
with their families she adds 
her firm made a survey of 5000 over30 women and discovered 
that only one in six wants to travel with family half said they 
participated in fitness and diet programs and almost a fourth of 
them earn at least 35000 a year 
this survey reveals that women are no longer happy with the 
same old getaway to the beach says eckert these women want to 
participate in their vacations they dont want to be passive 
travelers at their stage in life 
eckert a photographer and peace corps veteran sensed a good 
market that tied in with her own interests when she started her 
firm in l982 organizing seven tours 
this year shes offering 16 packages ranging from a 239 
weekend canoe trip on the wisconsin river to a 2495 twoweek 
cruise of the greek islands she and eight associates all women

athens ga ap a complete guide to state fishing records is 
now available from an athens publisher 
hendersons guide to freshwater amp saltwater state game fish 
records published by outdoor statistical resources lists state 
records for freshwater fish from all 50 states and saltwater 
records from all coastal states except hawaii maine and oregon 
which keep no such records 
rankings are listed for each state by species of fish the book 
also indicates which state records are world records 
one easy way to mess up a fishing trip is to get a hook caught 
in an arm leg or other part of your anatomy 
theres a relatively simple way to get the hook out without a 
trip to the doctor all you need is some ice a bit of relatively 
strong fishing line and some antiseptic 
it will hurt but not that badly and with after a quick patch 
job youll be ready to continue fishing 
heres how to do it according to the people at mercury marine 
if the hook is attached to a lure remove the lure then pack 
some ice over the wound to both numb the area and reduce bleeding 
tie a loop in the fish line and place the loop around the back 
of your wrist run the loop out to your hand between the thumb and 
forefinger 
put the other end of the loop over the hook and snug it against 
the inside bend then use your thumb to apply pressure on the eye 
of the hook down against the skin 
the pressure both steadies the hook and aligns the barb with the 
entry hole pushing down on the eye also spreads the wound open and 
the barb will come out without tearing as much skin 
while keeping pressure on the hook give the line a quick jerk 
the hook should pop out 
then rinse the cut in clean water apply antiseptic and a 
bandage then go back after the big one 
your casting will be in trouble if you put the line on your reel 
poorly the line could twist and tangle 
the american fishing tackle manufacturers association suggests 
the following steps to fill a reel 
revolving spool or levelwind reels 
insert a pencil or short stick through the hole in the supply 
spool have another person hold both ends of the stick and keep a 
little pressure on the spool 
the line should come off the top of the supply spool and in over 
the top of the reel fill to within oneeighth inch of the lip on 
the reel 
spinning reels 
attach the reel to a rod and string the line from the supply 
spool down through the guides open the bail and tie the line to 
the spool then flip the bail closed 
have another person hold the rim of the supply spool so it will 
spiral off the supply spool in the same coil direction as you want 
it to go onto the reel spool 
this prevents line twist as you wind on the line 
holding the rod tip several feet from the supply spool tense 
the line between the thumb and forefinger of your rodholding hand 
wind on several turns of line if the line is coming from the 
correct side of the supply spool it will spiral off in open loose 
coils 
if not it soon will begin to twist if this occurs turn the 
supply spool around fill the reel to slightly below the spool lip 
closedfaced spincast reels 
use the same methods as for openface reels except remove the 
nosecone and hold it slightly in front of the reel while winding on 
the line that way you can see when the spool is filled to the 
proper level slightly before the spool lip 
be sure to properly dispose of your old line if you throw it 
into the water it can kill fish or other marine life 
hardwick vt ap a computer course has been added to the 
activities for blind and visually impaired children at camp 
wapanacki one of the countrys oldest camps devoted to their 
interests 
campers between the ages of 6 and 21 can learn computer skills

and crafts and the performing arts at the wapanacki operated by 
the new york institute for special education the camp also is 
offering a special session for blind adults and their families 
vicky tripodi the camp director says many of the campers live 
in urban areas so the summer program offers them a chance to get 
outdoors and exercise the activities also let them learn new 
skills to help them cope at home she says 
if you want a boat for fishing or water sports but dont have 
much storage space in your small house or apartment a collapsible 
boat may be the answer 
made by portabote international of moutain view calif a new 
series of boats features models that fold to a thickness of 4 
one can be strapped to the top of your car like a surfboard 
the boats come in 8 10 and 12 models and weigh about half as 
much as comparable aluminum boats 
oxygenbased chemicals offer an alternative to chlorine for 
treating swimming pool water according to du pont which makes 
oxidizers for use in new pool shocking systems 
the systems can be a boon to chlorinesensitive swimmers their 
hair and their swimwear du pont says water can be treated in 15 
minutes without danger of underuse or overuse the company says the 
oxidizing systems also work in pools sanitized with bromine

602 billion its takeover bid for consolidated gold fields plc in 
a final attempt to win control of britains largest mining company 
minorco increased its offer by raising the cash portion of the 
bid for a total of 2635 a share up from the previous offer of 
2380 per share or a total of 54 billion minorco first offered

the sale of the associates represents another phase in our 
strategic development said martin s davis gulf amp westerns 
chairman and chief executive 
we have concluded that the current market dynamics and the 
financial and regulatory restraints inherent in our 
consumercommercial finance business are incompatible with those of 
our entertainment and publishing operations he said in a 
statement

and publishing operations through product development and through 
acquisitions the company said

publishing area as well so i think they can expand their already 
very strong positions in those areas 
he said the stock market has been unwilling to recognize what he 
believes is the true worth of the associates as reflected in gulf amp 
westerns share prices 
but manson said the company is taking a risk in running what 
essentially is a public auction for the division they are 
assuming there will be a buyer or buyers out there that will 
recognize the value they are seeking he said 
manson placed the value of the associates as in excess of 32 
billion 
the company has retained the new york investment banking firm 
lazard freres amp co to find a buyer for the division formally 
called the associates first capital corp sherman said 
the associates has 520 retail branch offices in 42 states and 
puerto rico through which it offers mortgages retail loans and 
other personal financing it also has 95 offices in japan and 45 in

the united states and canada is a leading source of financing for 
the trucking industry sherman said

national bank whose sole business is issuing credit cards he said 
the financial division had operating income of 3724 million on 
revenue of 205 billion in the fiscal year ended oct 31 1988

billion in 1982 to 112 billion the company said its assets

the number of working oil and gas rigs declined 
this week by one to total 778 halting a twoweek surge in the 
number of active rigs baker hughes inc reported 
over the previous two weeks the rig count had increased by 39 
following a lengthy downward trend a year ago the total was 916 
baker hughes said monday 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states pennsylvania showed the 
biggest decline with seven fewer rigs followed by texas five 
michigan four and north dakota two 
oklahoma showed the largest gain with eight additional rigs 
followed by kansas three louisiana and ohio two each and 
california and colorado one each new mexico and wyoming were 
unchanged from the previous week

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early activity today on the chicago board of trade 
with demand weak and enough moisture in both the western 
cornbelt and the southwestern wheat growing areas traders expected 
prices to settle in slightly lower ranges and stay there most of 
the day 
but some support came from talk of possible buys by the soviet 
union and a strong cash market also underpinned prices 
soybeans meanwhile got some backing from reports that the 
harvest in brazil was being delayed by too much rain 
wheat was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 393 cents a bushel corn was unchanged to 1

nec corp today announced the worlds fastest 
supercomputer a machine that can carry out more than 20 billion 
operations per second and spells trouble for the american lead in 
supercomputers 
necs sxx series will be so much faster than americanmade 
machines that us commercial and government customers may feel 
they have no choice but to buy the japanese machine said george 
lindamood an analyst at the gartner group consulting firm in 
stamford conn 
i imagine there will be some fairly severe government 
wrangling in washington as a result of this one lindamood said 
the sxx series will go on sale in the julyseptember period of 
1990 nec said that is about the same time cray research inc the 
minneapolisbased world leader in supercomputers begins delivery 
of its cray 3 models 
nec said the sxx series can attain peak vector speeds of 20 
billion floatingpoint operations per second floatingpoint 
operations are highprecision calculations on rows and columns of 
numbers 
in contrast the cray 3 is expected to perform up to 16 billion 
operations per second lindamood said 
the computers are being sold in north america by hnsx 
supercomputers inc a burlington massbased marketing company 
jointly owned by nec and honeywell inc they will range in price 
from 5 million to 23 million and will use a version of the unix 
base layer of software 
cray research did not immediately return a phone call seeking 
comment on the nec chip 
the other major us supercomputer maker is control data corps 
eta systems inc in japan competitors include hitachi ltd and 
fujitsu ltd 
nec has a big advantage in supercomputers because it is the 
worlds largest semiconductor manufacturer and can make its own 
highspeed logic chips in contrast cray relies on japans fujitsu 
for the central logic chips in its cray ymp line the central 
logic chips for its cray 3 line will come from a small company 
gigabit logic inc of newbury park calif lindamood said

unions at eastern airlines and a management 
group headed by former baseball commissioner peter ueberroth have 
reached tentative agreements that would remove a major obstacle to 
the sale of the strikebound carrier a labor source said today 
the source speaking on the condition of anonymity said a 
formal announcement would be made later today before us 
bankruptcy judge burton lifland in new york lifland must approve 
any sale of the airline 
lifland began a closed meeting with the principals at midday in 
bankruptcy court but there was no immediate word on the progress of 
the talks which have been held under a news blackout 
ueberroth and his group have been seeking more than 200 million 
in concessions from three unions and easterns noncontract 
employees but there was no immediate word on what if any 
givebacks were contained in the tentative accords 
the source declined to discuss the agreements further 
the tentative agreement followed a weekend of secret talks in 
washington between the unions and representatives of ueberroth who 
last week reached agreement to buy eastern from texas air corp for 
464 million ueberroth could have called off the deal if 
agreements were not reached with the unions by midnight tuesday 
ueberroth has said he will go ahead with plans to sell the 
lucrative eastern shuttle to new york developer donald trump for 
365 million 
the unions involved are the international association of 
machinists the air line pilots association and the transport 
workers union 
the iam struck eastern on march 4 after refusing to accept more 
than 120 million in wage and other concessions demanded by texas 
air easterns parent company the other unions have accepted 
concessions in the past but honored iams picket lines 
the unions brought eastern operations to a virtual halt and the 
airline filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws march 9 
five days after the walkout began 
eastern since the strike has been seeking court orders requiring 
the pilots to return to work a federal district judge in miami was 
scheduled to issue a ruling on the request today but his office 
said the judge had granted a request from eastern and the pilots 
union that he not issue the decision today 
the weekend talks were held under the guidance of attorney david 
shapiro who is serving as courtappointed examiner of the airline 
under an order issued by the bankruptcy court 
while union officials said they believed they could come to 
terms with the ueberroth group they expressed concerns about its 
plans for the carrier 
union officials also questioned statements by texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo that eastern could be operating within 24 hours of 
completion of the sale to ueberroth 
eastern has been flying a skeleton schedule since the iam 
walkout 
officials from two of the unions noting that the majority of 
easterns planes have been grounded for more than a month said it 
would take some time to inspect them 
they also said it would be foolish and costly to restore a full 
schedule immediately because eastern already carrying a heavy 
debt would have few passengers in the days immediately following 
resumption of service 
in a related matter texas air said it filed suit friday against 
trans world airlines inc charging that the rival carrier and its 
owner takeover expert carl icahn had interfered illegally in the 
talks between ueberroth and the unions 
twa and icahn responded in a statement sunday that the suit was 
frivolous 
the contacts i had with eastern unions were initiated by their 
request that i become involved icahn said i did not realize 
that i needed permission from texas air chairman frank lorenzo to 
take phone calls from people i consider my friends 
icahn also said he did not make any competing offer to the 
unions or a creditors committee which must approve any sale of the 
airline and that he would not do so unless ueberroths offer falls 
through

if youre looking for signs of inflation which 
these days is a popular participant sport you might not easily 
find it in wage increases but youll score if you look under 
benefits 
because benefits are as much a cost of doing business as wages 
and salaries the inflationary pressure or pressure on producer 
and consumer prices is much the same and the costs of some of 
those benefits are indeed rising 
however tending to obscure the benefits rise is the public 
display in many areas of rising wages at fastfood restaurants 
shopping malls and supermarkets which others things being equal 
will show up in higher prices 
in a city near here for example a roadside supermarket sign 
once reserved for sales and specials advertises hiring now 7 an 
hour a rate more than double the minimum wage at some nearby 
restaurants the signboards and table mats may carry helpwanted 
messages rather than the usual menu items 
but the statistics tell a different story that average weekly 
earnings of 32886 in march while 164 higher than in february 
were still below the january level of 32913 hardly an 
inflationary trend 
getting less attention are benefits which soared last year and 
remain a source of worry for employers many are seeking to reduce 
the load a turnabout from the practice of the previous decade 
when benefits were added lavishly 
the cost to business of benefits last year jumped 68 percent 
almost double the 35 percent rate of increase in 1987 according 
to labor department figures a good deal of that increase resulted 
from everincreasing health care items and a social security rise 
the social security tax increase for employers which brought 
the rate to 751 percent from 715 percent of payroll in 1987 
wont be duplicated this year and so is at least temporarily 
removed as an inflationary factor 
however inflation in the general health care category remains a 
factor in business costs resisting the holddown efforts of a 
growing number of employers large and small while other 
categories were brought under control in recent years health care 
has persistently defiantly gone its own way 
the pay rise last year was much less than for benefits 
increasing 41 percent or not even as much as the consumer price 
index still it was much faster than the 33 percent gain of 1987 
the question now is whether private business can absorb the 
increases or will be forced to pass them on through the chain of 
producers manufacturers and distributors relentlessly and 
eventually reaching the consumer 
on the plus side some manufacturers have greatly improved their 
efficiency in the past decade whether such efficiencies can help 
them hold the line in the face of reduced sales and rising costs is 
another matter 
on the minus side unemployment is now down to 5 percent of all 
civilian workers and well under that for adult men and women 
thats a 15year low suggesting the labor pool is being drained of 
productive workers 
by using less efficient workers and untrained workers who may 
require extensive instruction business will be under a strain to 
hold prices but an even bigger strain might be in containing 
benefits costs

cbs inc said monday its firstquarter profit 
skidded from a year earlier when results were swelled by a huge 
gain on the sale of its records division but said improvement at 
its television network helped boost income from continuing 
operations by 26 percent 
the broadcasting giant said its net income fell to 561 
million or 218 a share in the three months ended march 31 from 
9113 million or 3534 a share a year earlier 
firstquarter revenue rose 5 percent to 7312 million from 
6966 million a year earlier 
the 1988 results were fattened by an aftertax gain of 8666 
million on the sale of cbs records to sony corp 
cbs said its income from continuing operations rose to a record 
563 million from 448 million a year earlier 
laurence a tisch president and chief executive said the 
operating reuslts reflected a profit of undisclosed size at the cbs 
television network in contrast with a minor loss a year earlier 
he said the network had improved results in several key time 
periods including primetime sports and news 
the miniseries lonesome dove was broadcast during the 
quarter and achieved the highest ratings for that type of program 
in five years 
the company said its interest income fell to 394 million from 
515 million in the same period a year earlier which included a 
pretax gain of 14 million on the sale of treasury securities 
the decline was also attributed to lower balances of cash and 
securities due to tax payments on the cbs records sale and 
acquisitions of a television station in miami and two radio 
stations in detroit

british regulators have set an april 26 deadline for minorcos 
attempt to capture more than 50 percent of consolidated gold 
fields minorco a mining investment concern currently owns 296

injunction issued in us district court in manhattan blocking 
minorco from acquiring more than 30 percent of consolidated gold 
fields shares 
the shares which closed at 2371 friday jumped to 2507 
early monday before minorco announced its revised offer then fell

oppenheimer familys anglo american corp gold mining giant and the 
diamond mining group de beers consolidated mines ltd 
minorcos original 51 billion hostile bid last september 
automatically lapsed when it was referred to britains monopolies 
and mergers commission the commission cleared the proposed 
acquisition in february prompting the renewed bids 
in a novel defense against minorco consolidated gold fields has 
promised to pay its shareholders 22 billion in dividends if it 
does not meet its own profit forecast the company has guaranteed 
shareholders more than 20 percent average annual compound growth in 
earnings per share over the next three years 
if its target of 680 in cumulative earnings per share is not 
reached by the end of the 1992 fiscal year then shareholders will 
get a special cash dividend of 1020 a share it said

a former merrill lynch mortgage trader whose 
allegedly unauthorized transactions resulted in heavy trading 
losses for the firm will face a hearing on fraud charges the 
securities and exchange commission said monday 
the sec charged that howard a rubin the former head 
mortgagebacked securities trader at merrill lynch government 
securities willfully violated federal antifraud laws in connection 
with trades in april 1987 
a hearing will be scheduled to determine whether the 
allegations against rubin are true and if so to decide what 
remedial action if any is appropriate edwin h nordlinger 
deputy regional administrator of the secs new york office said in 
a statement 
if rubin is found guilty he faces sanctions from temporary 
suspension from securities trading to limited trading activities to 
a lifetime ban from the business 
rubin currently works as a mortgage securities trader at bear 
stearns amp co a spokeswoman for the securities firm said 
an attorney representing rubin ira lee sorkin said rubin 
denies he committed any fraud 
he has had an outstanding reputation in the industry and an 
unblemished record sorkin said and we intend to litigate this 
matter to the hilt 
sorkin said the secs action appears based entirely on an 
allegation that rubin did not follow his supervisors instructions 
how the sec regards this as a violation of the federal 
securities laws is beyond our imagination he said 
allegedly unauthorized transactions by rubin while he was at 
merrill lynch were blamed by the company as a major reason for huge 
trading losses that cut the investment firms pretax earnings by 
about 275 million in the second quarter of 1987 
the transactions involved hundreds of millions of dollars of 
certain types of mortgagebacked securities which represent 
mortgages that are pooled and then packaged as marketable 
securities for sale to investors 
merrill lynchs losses at the time considered one of the 
largest trading setbacks in wall street history were linked to 
unauthorized trading in a particularly risky form of 
mortgagebacked securities in which the interest and principal 
portions of the securities are traded separately 
as a result of the huge loss the giant brokerage firm 
reorganized its mortgage securities division and ousted the 
executives in charge of the operation rubin also was fired 
the sec said in its order instituting administrative proceedings 
against rubin that he acted against the instructions of his 
superiors in buying and selling the securities 
he also failed to properly record his trades in merrill lynch 
books the sec said 
an asyet unscheduled hearing would be held before an sec judge 
the agency said

waterford glass group plc irelands 
wellknow but financially troubled crystal company reported monday 
that it made a small profit in 1988 compared to a loss in the 
previous year 
however the company called last years earnings of 430000 
vs a 8537 million loss in 1987 significantly worse than 
expected 
sales rose to 43529 million from 40397 million 
waterford had been optimistic about its 1988 figures until it 
hired accountants peat marwick mclintock in january to conduct an 
independent review of its financial performance 
the accounting firm discovered serious accounting errors and 
shortly after waterford chairman paddy hayes resigned he is being 
replaced by paddy byrne chairman and chief executive of 
waterfords wedgwood division 
the accountants found that waterfords internal review had 
overstated last years profits by 2145 million largely through 
overvaluation of inventories 
in recent years waterford one of irelands best known 
manufacturers and one of the countrys largest employers has 
suffered huge losses and laid off onethird of the 3000 employees 
in its crystal division 
half of waterfords crystal is exported directly to the united 
states and another 35 percent is bought by americans traveling

a new south korean airline with plans for 
service to europe and north america on monday announced a deal 
worth about 1 billion to buy nine boeing co jetliners and take 
options on seven more 
including the new agreement with fledgling asiana airlines 
seattlebased boeing has announced orders for 110 jetliners worth 
87 billion so far this year 
asiana based in seoul south korea began operations within 
that country on dec 23 it said it will use its new jets to expand 
to other asian markets and eventually to north america and europe 
asiana ordered five 737400s and took options for another five 
it also signed letters of intent to order two 747400 jumbo jets 
and take options for two more and to convert two previous options 
for widebody 767300s to firm orders 
a 747400 the worlds largest passenger jet sells for 116 
million to 136 million a copy depending on configuration and 
equipment boeing said the smaller 737400 twinjet sells for 31 
million to 36 million while a widebody 767300 goes for 66 
million to 73 million 
in the short term we could have saved a few dollars by buying 
or leasing older planes sy park chairman of kumho business 
group asianas parent company said at a news conference 
however a new airline has enough problems establishing its 
market base without the burden of heavy maintenance 
responsibilities and the uncertainty of whether older planes will 
perform reliably he said 
park said other aircraft manufacturers had talked about selling 
planes to asiana but at first others didnt take us seriously 
boeing did take us seriously 
jf chorlton a boeing vice president said asiana had 
indicated an interest in boeing aircraft as early as a year ago he 
said boeing had made room on its production line for the planes 
before the order was announced 
asiana began its korean service with six 737400s leased from 
gpa group ltd 
deliveries of asianas new planes will begin in july 1992 and 
continue through june 1993 asiana will get the two 767300s 
ordered earlier in 1990 boeing said 
boeing normally doesnt announce letters of intent said boeing 
commercial airplanes spokesman randy harrison but asiana had made 
it clear it intended to buy the planes 
harrison said a letter of intent is just short of an order but 
no money is paid to begin construction

grain futures prices closed mixed but soybeans 
were mostly higher monday on the chicago board of trade 
both markets opened under slight pressure as a result of weak 
demand and weekend rain or snowfall in both the western cornbelt 
and the southwest wheat growing areas 
following last weeks losses soybeans skidded to an 11month 
low only to make a quick runup on ideas the market may have been 
oversold 
although commission houses and local traders continued buying 
the large commercial houses blunted the rally by staying on the 
selling side of the equation and soybeans closed off the high for 
the day 
both oldcrop wheat and corn were higher on shortcovering but 
contracts for the deferred months remained lower 
on the close wheat was 4 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
the contract for may delivery at 394 corn was 1 cent lower to 1 
cent higher with may at 266 oats were cent to 1 cents 
higher with may at 187 and soybeans were 6 cents to 8 cents

the slick of thick crude oil spilled by 
the exxon valdez stalled monday in its movement toward the nations 
no 1 fishing port and was breaking up in rough waves and high 
wind the coast guard said 
however the stormy weather hampered cleanup efforts as small 
craft advisories and gale warnings were posted along the central 
alaskan coast where 101 million gallons of crude oil oozed across 
prince william sound threatening fisheries and killing thousands 
of birds and animals 
the wind was out of the northeast which kept oil from washing 
ashore in untainted inlets and the kenai fjords national park 
its not pushing it oil to the kenai peninsula and thats 
good the weather is breaking up the slick and thats good said 
coast guard spokesman rick meidt 
exxon said monday it planned to repay the government for the 
militarys expenses but noted its expenses would also be deducted 
from its income taxes 
were anticipating the costs incurred by the government at all 
levels will be eventually reimbursed by exxon said don cornett 
the companys top alaska executive in the normal course of 
things cost of doing business is deducted from your income tax and 
that is how it is expressed to customers 
as of monday 18000 barrels of crude have been recovered or 8 
percent of the 240000 barrels spilled exxon said with additional 
skimmers about 2000 barrels were being recovered a day although 
reports from state officials and the coast guard so far have placed 
the figure at about 1000 barrels a day 
at the fishing port of kodiak which landed a 166 million catch 
last year to lead the nation preparations to battle the floating 
oil continued in spite of the good news fishermen covered logs 
with fish net and strung them together as floating booms to keep 
oil out of vital areas town leaders even broadcast boommaking 
techniques on local television 
oil was still at least 60 miles from kodiaks fishing areas and 
appeared to have stalled on its southwesterly drift toward the 
town meidt said 
the leading edge has retreated a little bit and oil was 
beginning to break into tar balls and sink said bill lamoreaux 
the states onscene coordinator thats good news 
there was some concern that as the storm systems generating 
mondays turbulence move closer to land higher waves in the sound 
could wash oil over containment booms protecting spawning areas and 
other protected spots 
if the storm is a severe one well see some more beaches 
impacted state cleanup coordinator jim hayden 
still hayden said the fisheries were welldefended and boats 
were being moved from fishrich sawmill bay to other heavily oiled 
areas 
some of the operations are shifting away from the protective 
actions at the fisheries to some oil cleanup he said 
spotter flights over the spill were canceled monday but the 
weather was not expected to curtail boomlaying operations 
the coast guard sent six additional cutters monday from west 
coast ports to assist in the cleanup effort on sunday military 
cargo jets flew oil skimmers booms and beach landing craft into 
alaska and commanders issued a pacificwide call for more 
equipment to fight the nations worst oil spill 
repairs were under way on the tanker exxon valdez which spilled 
the oil 25 miles from valdez when it ran aground and ripped its 
hull on a reef well outside the normal shipping channel salvage 
workers have reinforced punctured areas of the tanker to prevent 
further fractures meidt said 
the state said the tanker anchored in a remote cove for the 
repairs continues to leak oil which escapes containment booms 
because currents keep shifting the plastic booms and snagging them 
on the ships bow 
a 40foot gray whale was found dead in an oil area sunday but 
an autopsy revealed that the marine mammal died long before the 
oil spill ever occurred said alaska department of fish and game 
spokeswoman sheila nickerson 
wildlife experts say many animals are found dead in prince 
william sound in the spring 
officials said 119 dead sea otters have been counted and two 
boats were waiting to unload additional dead animals hundreds of 
dead birds have been counted including some rare yellowbilled 
loons and two eagles 
but wildlife experts say the toll is really in the thousands 
because most dead animals sink in the ocean or remain on shore 
six barrels of oil leaked monday from the keystone canyon while 
the tanker was being loaded at the valdez oil terminal a spokesman 
for alyeska pipeline service co said the oil was captured by 
containment boom and skimmers alyeska said

the payments as part of detroits annual executive pigout 
we think it would be far better advised to invest in new 
facilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuable 
resources on trying to keep up with the junk bond barons they 
said in a statement 
other ford officers listed in mondays proxy statement along 
with their salaries supplemental compensation payments and stock 
options exercised were 
louis r ross executive vice president for north american 
automotive operations and named monday as executive vice president 
for international automotive operations 35 million 
philip benton executive vice president and president of the 
ford automotive group 3 million 
gilmour ross predecessor in international operations who was 
appointed executive vice president for corporate staffs 17 
million 
the appointments of gilmour ross and alexander trotman who 
succeeds rosee become effective may 1 
because gilmour was the only one of the three also named to the 
office of the chief executive which is shared by petersen poling 
and executive vice president stanley seneker the companys chief 
financial officer he is seen as the likely choice to succeed 
petersen when the chairman reaches fords mandatory retirement age 
of 65 in the fall of 1991 
at the end of march vice chairman william clay ford sr 
grandson of the companys founder retired from the company and his 
title was eliminated ford who was a member of the office of the 
chief executive will remain a member of the companys board of 
directors 
the promotion of gilmour 54 leaves only general motors corp 
without an heir apparent to its chairman gm chairman roger b 
smith is expected to retire when he turns 65 in july 1990 
last november chrysler corp promoted gerald greenwald to vice 
chairman tapping him as the likely successor to chairman lee 
iacocca who is not expected to seek a new contract when his 
expires in december 1991 
gilmour joined ford in 1960 as a financial analyst he has been 
president of ford motor credit co vice president and controller 
vice president for external and personnel affairs in 1984 and 
executive vice president and chief financial officer in 1986 he 
took over the companys international operations in october 1987 
ross has been executive vice president for north american 
automobile operations since february 1985 he joined ford in 1955 
as a research engineer in the 1950s and 60s he worked in various 
jobs in the engineering and manufacturing ends of the business he 
later worked overseas and in fords truck operations before moving 
to the north american operations 
trotman joined ford of britain in 1955 and had a variety of 
planning responsibilities before being elected vice president for 
fords european truck operations in 1979 last year he became 
president of ford of europe last february he was appointed 
executive vice president for north american automotive operations

heating oil for may delivery ended the day at 5345 cents a gallon 
up 185 cents from last fridays session

trading in advance of the american petroleum institutes weekly 
report on oil and gas inventories the report is scheduled for

people are anticipating bullish numbers said james r 
fiedler vice president of energy brokering for edampf man

eastern airlines isnt ready to soar back 
immediately to majorcarrier status even once striking employees 
agree to return to work at the crippled airline 
once easterns unions agree to return it could take 10 days for 
the airline to restore 80 percent of its prestrike schedule of 
1040 flights daily said karen ceremsak an eastern spokeswoman 
airliners idled for weeks must be depickled and moved from 
miami hangars to other airports crew members must be ferried back 
to their bases laidoff nonunion workers must be called back if 
theyre even available and myriad operations from food to fares to 
computerized scheduling must be addressed before eastern can fly 
the bulk of its prestrike schedule 
you cant just go the same day you get the signal ms 
ceremsak said we have to make scheduling decisions and there are 
a lot of details and all those little behindthescenes things 
last week in announcing an agreement for a group led by peter 
v ueberroth to buy eastern texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
said the airline could return to significant amounts of service 
within 24 hours after its unions reached new work agreements with 
the prospective new management 
the group has offered the unions a 30 percent stake in eastern 
in return for costsaving contract concessions 
sources said the ueberroth group reached tentative agreements 
with union representatives during weekend negotiations and on 
monday the parties met with us bankruptcy judge burton lifland 
who must approve the sale 
lifland also would have to approve any plan governing wouldbe 
passengers whose tickets became useless when eastern was struck 
the value of the unused tickets is estimated at about 200 million 
and the holders are considered unsecured creditors 
eastern spokesman robin matell said he didnt know what effect 
the completed sale of the airline would have on ticketholders 
adding it was probably premature to make any predictions about 
ticketing 
eastern was virtually grounded after its pilots and flight 
attendants unions began honoring a march 4 strike by its machinists 
and sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors on march 9 
with a few thousand nonunion employees and some 200 pilots the 
airline rebuilt its schedule to about 110 flights daily focusing 
on its northeastern shuttle and latin american routes 
to return eastern to full service will require preparation on 
numerous fronts 
less than 15 percent of easterns 250plane fleet has been 
flying and at least 50 planes have been pickled or taken out 
of service their engines vents and intakes have been sealed to 
prevent damage and ms ceremsak estimated it requires 100 manhours 
per plane to return them to service the other idled planes have 
been undergoing maintenance checks 
easterns parked planes are all in miami atlanta or new york 
eastern served 118 cities before its strike and its planes and crew 
members most of them scattered to their homes must be ferried to 
the appropriate airports 
catering contracts have to be resumed or obtained fuel made 
available and computers reloaded with new scheduling information 
some of the 3400 pilots who havent flown since march 4 may 
have to undergo refresher training required by the federal aviation 
administration if they havent made at least three takeoffs and 
landings within 90 days ms ceremsak had no estimate of how many 
pilots would need that training 
the company also will have to replace nonstriking workers who 
went on to other jobs after being laid off when eastern slashed its 
flight schedule 
we dont have any estimate on how many would choose to come 
back to work ms ceremsak said of the nearly 12000 nonunion 
employees who include skycaps clerical workers and reservations 
agents 
there also will be emotional issues 
i think theres definitely going to be some bad feelings 
between union employees returning to work and management holdovers 
and any others who worked said rick iacino a machinists union 
general chairman theres no way in hell you can stop peoples 
feelings 
even once it is capable of flying its prestrike schedule 
eastern still must rebound from virtually no advance sales weeks 
of negative publicity and passenger defections to other airlines 
that aggressively have been moving into easterns turf 
ms ceremsak said the airline likely would offer incentives such 
as sharply discounted fares or buyone getonefree companion 
ticket offers

the state banking commissioner said monday it 
could take up to 18 months three times the normal period to 
review ncnb incs bid to acquire citizens amp southern corp 
camps officials said the long wait may kill the takeover attempt 
but ncnb said it feels there are no legal or regulatory impediments 
to the merger 
the camps board last week rejected a 24 billion stock exchange 
offer that ncnb said would create the nations sixth largest 
banking company ncnb reportedly has been preparing a new offer 
and the north carolina banking company monday dismissed the notion 
that the proposed merger would require a lengthy review process 
georgia banking commissioner jack dunn released a statement 
outlining the regulatory matters that could be involved in the 
consideration of a ncnbcamps deal dunn said such a review would not 
begin until the department of banking and finance received a merger 
application 
although a final decision would normally be reached within six 
months applications involving complex legal and technical issues 
have required 12 to 18 months statefederal regulatory time dunn 
said 
camps officials seized upon dunns statement saying it confirmed 
their position that ncnbs bid has serious regulatory problems 
given the length of time for the state to resolve these 
issues and the uncertainty of a successful resolution we think 
ncnbs bid is dead said camps chairman bennett a brown it is 
time for both of our institutions to get back to the business of 
banking 
ben johnson an attorney with alston amp bird camps corporate 
counsel said twelve to 18 months is a pretty long period of 
time for a deal like this to be in limbo 
johnson said the value of ncnb stock during the period can 
be all over the place 
ncnb spokeswoman lynn easley said from her companys 
headquarters in charlotte nc that dunn broke no ground in his 
statement and that he simply recited the law 
ncnb is quite confident there are no legal or regulatory 
impediments to the merger it has proposed to the citizens amp 
southern corp ms easley said 
many of the items referred to in dunns statement are legal 
matters that regulators would be required to consider in any bank 
acquisition proposal some appeared to have particular relevance to 
the ncnbcamps proposal and would require consultation with the 
georgia department of law dunn said 
one such issue is whether ncnbs interests in texas would 
jeopardize its eligibility to acquire the atlantabased camps ncnb 
last year paid more than 200 million for a 20 percent stake in 
first republicbank corp after the federal deposit insurance corp 
chose ncnb to manage and operate the financially ailing texas 
facility 
dunn said an acquisition may be rejected if it involves a 
holding company that has its largest aggregate state deposit base 
outside the 11state southern region which does not include texas 
or has more than 20 percent of its aggregate deposit base outside 
the region 
there are exceptions to that provision however including the 
presence of insolvent banks dunn said the texas banks insolvency 
at the time of ncnbs involvement could affect the interpretation 
of the regulations 
the statement released by dunn simply restates the law and 
regulations governing approval for interstate banking 
acquisitions ms easley said it raises no new legal or 
regulatory issues

washington taiwans exportimport bank announced plans monday 
to provide loans to american companies to help encourage american 
exports and reduce the huge us trade deficit with the island 
the loans are part of the taiwan governments continuing 
campaign to persuade taiwanese firms to buy american said kw 
kung executive vice president of the exportimport bank of the 
republic of china on taiwan 
kung said the bank has 200 million to lend to american 
companies to help them export machinery and other goods and 
services to taiwan against deferred payment from purchasers 
kung plans to take his loan message to eight us cities 
stretching from boston and new york to seattle and los angeles 
the unique effort to promote another countrys exports stemmed 
from concern in taiwan that it would be targeted under new us 
trade laws directed against countries who persistently sell more to 
the united states than they buy 
sheu kesheng economic director of taiwans washington mission 
said that within four years the surplus should be largely 
eliminated but to reduce it to zero is very difficult 
the us trade deficit with taiwan dropped from 18 to 141 
billion from 1987 to 1988 and is expected to narrow by at least 10 
percent a year he said sheu said his governments own statistics 
showed the taiwan surplus dropped from 16 billion to 104 billion 
the past year 
us trade with taiwan started registering deficits in the early 
1970s and since then the island has sent 15 buy american 
purchasing missions to the united states reduced import tariffs 16 
times and more recently appreciated its currency 49 percent 
against the us dollar sheu said 
another round of tariff reductions will be announcd in a few 
weeks and plans call for reducing taiwans average tariff at 55 
percent now comparable to that of the united states to 35 percent 
within four years he added 
kung said us exporters hoping to use taiwan exportimport bank 
credit may contact any of about 40 us major and regional banks 
authorized to borrow from his bank at 655 percent annual interest 
making for a relending rate to the exporter of approximately 83 
percent

copper futures prices posted significant gains monday at the new 
york commodity exchange on concerns about tight supplies 
on other markets unleaded gasoline led a modest rally in energy 
futures sugar futures were clobbered by profittaking and live 
hog futures advanced on speculation that marketings would drop as 
farmers concentrated on spring planting 
the move in copper followed an erratic performance last week 
when the metal skyrocketed last wednesday on the heels of five 
straight slumping sessions 
copper at the comex began the day strong shrugged off reports 
of higherthanexpected stocks at the london mercantile exchange 
broke an important resistance level at 138 per pound and held the 
gains 
several producers are supposed to be experiencing tightness 
but we had one report out of chile that there are actual problems 
supplying said william oneill director of research for elders 
futures inc new york 
then we got rumors that a major new york trading house was 
looking to take a substantial amount out of the comex warehouse and 
refine it into highgrade copper he added the speculation is 
that it may be related to a shortage one of the producers is 
experiencing 
copper futures prices settled 660 cents to 780 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in april at 1416 a pound 
among the precious metals gold advanced 230 to 260 with 
april on the comex at 386 a troy ounce silver was 52 cents to 
64 cents higher with april at 5821 a troy ounce 
gasoline was the surprise leader among the energy futures 
because demand for the product doesnt peak until the start of the 
summer driving season mondays rally also looked past reports that 
several opec members were ignoring production quotas pushing the 
cartels daily output to 20 million barrels per day 
crude oil rose 2 cents to 57 cents with the may contract at the 
new york mercantile exchange settling at 2059 a barrel heating 
oil was unchanged to 185 cents higher with may at 5345 cents a 
gallon and unleaded gasoline was 80 cent to 225 cents higher 
with may at 6720 cents a gallon 
sugar futures were 32 cent to 50 cent lower on the new york 
coffee cocoa and sugar exchange with the may contract at 1188 
cents a pound 
the recent strength had as much to do with todays loss as 
anything said arthur stevenson analyst for shearson lehman 
hutton inc new york 
there were so many rumors going around about buys by this 
country or that and a lot of people got nervous and started taking 
profits in case none of it materializes he added 
ironically rumors that mexico bought as much as 280000 tons in 
recent days made the rounds just minutes after the market closed 
live hog futures were the only positive note in the complex at 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
many pork producers grow their own feed and now is the time 
they start field preparations for the feed crops said chuck 
levitt analyst for shearon lehman hutton inc chicago as 
planting operations get busy marketing the hogs becomes less of a 
priority the futures gain on anticipation that fewer will be 
marketed in the coming months 
live cattle settled 20 cent lower to 02 cent higher with 
april at 7787 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent to 50 
cent lower with april at 7717 cents a pound live hogs were 05 
cent to 67 cent higher with april at 3982 cents a pound and 
frozen pork bellies were 25 cent lower to 20 cent higher with 
may at 3420 cents a pound 
grain futures prices closed mixed but soybeans mostly higher on 
the chicago board of trade 
on the close wheat was 4 cents lower to 3 cents higher with 
the contract for may delivery at 394 corn was 1 cent lower to 1 
cent higher with may at 266 oats were cent to 1 cents 
higher with may at 187 and soybeans were 6 cents to 8 cents 
higher with may at 718

intel corp unveiled its i486 computer chip 
monday while at least seven computer and software makers announced 
plans to produce new products based on the chip 
this is not really an intel event this is an industry 
event intel vice president dave house said in announcing the 
i486 at the comdex trade show here its our alliance with the 
software industry that brings out the strength in our products 
the company also announced a faster version of its 80386 chip 
and a lowerpower version of its lessexpensive 80386sx chip that 
is suited for laptop computers 
the new i486 also known as the 80486 puts intel into 
headtohead competition with motorola incs 68040 chip announced 
less than two weeks ago industry analysts said it crams 12 
million transistors onto a piece of silicon just over a halfinch 
square 
the 80386 by contrast contains onefourth as many transistors 
or 275000 
a computer with the chip will perform operations 50 times faster 
than the original ibm personal computer and will be able to run any 
software developed for the 80386 house said 
meanwhile intel said six companies american telephone amp 
telegraph co award software inc hewlettpackard co microsoft 
corp phar lap software inc and phoenix technologies ltd 
announced products based on the technology 
in addition prime computer inc said it would work with intel 
to design processors based on the i486 that would run eight times 
faster than the i486 alone 
the 486 is a fantastic advance its a major improvement in 
speed but it is the same architecture as the 386 said microsoft 
chairman bill gates the most exciting thing is the protection it 
offers the investment that users have made in software 
the chip will not be available until this fall and wont be 
produced in quantity until late this year intel said in a news 
release 
the new 80386 chip called the 80386dx will run at 33 million 
cycles per second and is 25 times faster than the original ibm pc 
house said 
computer and software makers meanwhile praised the 
announcement of the i486 and stressed the importance of the new 
chips compatibility with the 80386 
that level of compatibility ensures that the software you run 
today will run on future workstations said john frank president 
of zenith data systems 
now well see a stable platform for software development over 
the next several years that will allow the full capabilities of the 
386 architecture to be implemented said rod canion president 
and chief executive of compaq computer corp 
karl koessel technical editor of pc world magazine called the 
chip the next generation of computer technology 
it is much faster and it is compatible koessel said what 
people want is compatibility and the 486 does everything the 386 
does

gulf air said monday it will spend 1 
billion over the next five years to buy 18 aircraft from the 
european consortium airbus industrie and the us manuacturer 
boeing co 
gulf air spokesman abdullah abdelkarim said the airliners will 
include 12 airbus a320s and six boeing 767s abdelkarim said the 
deal was being made on an optional basis allowing the airline to 
drop an order without ann liability to compensate the manufacturer 
a spokesman for seattlebased boeing said it has held talks with 
gulf air about purchasing 767s but declined to confirm the deal 
gulf air is owned by the governments of bahrain qatar oman and 
abu dhabi the announcement came one day after gulf airs board met 
in the qatari capital of doha 
abdelkarim said that the 18 new jets will be delivered between 
1990 and 1994 gulf air is currently spending 260 million as part 
of a modernization program involving the lease of four boeing 
767300s 
the airline last week secured a 208 million loan from 22 
international and regional banks to cover part of the modenization 
it expects to cover the balance of 52 million with a similar 
credit from japanese institutions 
abdelkarim said that by june the airline will have nine 
tristars eight boeing 737s and six boeing 767300s the fleet

a federal bankruptcy judge has approved a 
reorganization plan for defunct frontier airlines which sought 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in august 1986 when it shut down 
for good 
the reorganization plan approved by us bankruptcy judge 
charles matheson on friday allows about 500 of frontiers former 
employees and others to be paid 100 percent of courtapproved 
claims 
continental airlines bought denverbased frontiers assets for 
119 million after negotiations to sell frontier to united airlines 
fell through 
under the reorganization plan continental a unit of texas air 
corp would receive 20 million to 70 million after all other 
creditors are paid the total of the individual payments was not 
released 
theres no question this is a great deal for continental 
said bill waller a denver lawyer representing the claims of 57 
former frontier employees 
waller said his clients will receive substantial payments 
from frontier and continental were generally satisfied he 
said 
frontiers creditors gave nearly 95 percent approval to the plan 
in a vote taken march 31 the plan calls for former employees and 
others to receive either cash or a combination of cash and notes 
for their allowed claims 
most of frontiers former employees dropped their claims against 
the airline two years ago in exchange for limited cash settlements 
and jobs at continental lawyers estimate that only about 500 
employees are still owed money 
the claims range from a few hundred dollars to a few hundred 
thousand dollars for some former officers of frontier said carl 
eklund the lawyer who shepherded the reorganization plan through 
the courts for frontier and continental 
mathesons approval of the reorganization plan does not settle 
all claims against frontier the defunct airline still faces more 
than 268 million in outstanding claims although that amount is 
expected to be trimmed substantially said eklund 
waller speculated that when all the claims are paid under the 
reorganization plan continentals take could reach 100 million 
he said that does not count the route structure the planes and the 
employees continental also received when it purchased frontiers 
assets 
others involved in the case however estimated continental 
would receive 20 million to 70 million

texas aampm university and georgia tech researchers said monday 
they believed they had duplicated a utah experiment that produced 
nuclear fusion using basic chemistry 
texas aampms experiment generated energy but chemists charles 
martin kenneth marsh and bruce gammon said they were not sure it 
resulted from fusion 
the university of utah scientists who first claimed the result 
however backed up their colleagues work 
the texas aampm reaction was detected early saturday and came 
after more than two weeks of intense work to duplicate the utah 
research the chemists said 
the excess energy aspect has been confirmed said martin 
35 an electrochemist but the reaction was so small the 
scientists did not have equipment sophisticated enough to detect 
the production of neutrons that would certify the reaction as 
fusion he said 
fusion occurs when the nuclei of atoms join together releasing 
energy 
this is a very unusual result and we have not totally 
dismissed the possibility of some unusual chemical process which we 
might have not accounted for and we are currently exploring this 
possibility further martin said 
however while texas aampms research focused on the energy 
produced by the process georgia techs weekend experiment looked 
for neutrons and found them a probe which measured 40 neutrons 
an hour of normal background radiation measured 600 an hour during 
the experiment 
we think weve confirmed the utah experiment to prove cold 
fusion senior research scientist james mahaffey told a news 
conference in atlanta following texas aampms announcement 
mahaffey cautioned that his team had not confirmed the process 
produces more energy than it consumes 
the texas chemists detected energy in the form of excess heat 
using a calorimeter built to detect temperature variations as low 
as 0001 of a degree said marsh 49 director of the schools 
thermodynamics research center 
the reaction produced more energy as heat than the scientists 
were putting into it in the form of electric current 
marsh said the likelihood was small that the energy was produced 
by a chemical and not nuclear reaction 
but we have to investigate he said its a most unusual 
scientific observation and could have considerable repercussions in 
the scientific world 
the chemists counterparts in utah stanley pons and martin 
fleischmann said the texas results were almost precisely the 
same as those weve reported 
pons said of the georgia tech work this is just incredible 
thats one of the nicest things that could happen 
pons said he expected increased efforts by scientists around the 
world to confirm the experiment many scientists had expressed 
profound skepticism that such fusion could be achieved without 
superhigh heat as the utah researchers claim 
last week two hungarian scientists claimed to have duplicated 
the utah results hungarys official mti news agency reported 
pons chairman of the chemistry department at the university in 
salt lake city and fleischmann of southampton university in 
england on march 23 claimed to have sustained a controlled fusion 
reaction using common laboratory equipment 
scientists long have sought the peaceful use of nuclear fusion 
which powers the sun and hydrogen bombs and is viewed as a possible 
replacement for conventional energy sources it would be clean 
inexpensive and virtually inexhaustable 
unlike nuclear fission reactors now in use fusion does not 
generate significant amounts of radioactive waste 
there is a need for much more money for research in this area 
if it is going to get the attention it deserves martin said 
but thats not surprising since this didnt exist two weeks ago 
its open season on fusion mahaffey said 
in the texas aampm experiment a palladium electrode 1mm in 
diameter and 50mm long was surrounded by a platinum counter 
electrode and bathed in 100 cubic centimeters of heavy water 
containing atoms of deuterium a heavy isotope of hydrogen heated 
to 806 degrees 
the scientists detected a constant 1144watt energy gain in the 
experiment 
once we understand whats going on then we do what engineers 
call a scaleup said kenneth hall associate dean of the 
college of engineering at texas aampm we have one watt we need to 
go to hundreds and thousands of watts 
the researchers measured excess heat that had no obvious 
chemical source and also found gamma rays neutrons and tritium 
another isotope of hydrogen above those expected as normal 
background radiation 
school officials said the lab area was checked for radioactivity 
but no harmful levels were detected

a federal prosecuror indicated monday that a 
deadline that could jeopardize drexel burnham lambert incs 
landmark criminal plea deal with the government passed without an 
extension 
assistant us attorney bruce baird said there was no written 
agreement extending the monday deadline for the wall street 
investment firm to settle separate civil securities fraud charges 
filed by the securities and exchange commission 
baird who heads the offices securities and commodities fraud 
unit had said the government did not plan a lengthy extension of 
the deadline apparently none was made monday 
the only letter that there is the letter that extends the 
deadline until april 10 baird said there isnt any other 
writing or agreement 
baird declined to say whether that meant the deadline indeed had 
passed but he said nothing formal has changed at all 
he also refused to say what action the manhattan us attorneys 
office might take if no pact was reached by the deadline 
failure to reach agreement could nullify the us attorneys 
offices plea deal with drexel and raise the possibility of a far 
more serious indictment on fraud and racketeering charges 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said he did not know whether a 
deadline had been extended but added were still conversing 
were still negotiating 
sec officials and drexel attorneys were reported to have left

settling civil charges including insider trading brought by the 
sec last september was a precondition for drexels criminal plea 
bargain three months later the firm agreed to plead guilty to six 
felonies and pay a record 650 million in fines and restitution 
officials familiar with the talks indicated earlier monday that 
an agreement between the sec and drexel was imminent possibly by 
the end of the day but no announcement came from any quarter 
drexel and the sec initially agreed to complete their 
negotiations jan 30 that deadline was extended several times by 
mutual consent of prosecutors and drexel as talks deadlocked 
the us attorneys office governs the terms of the secdrexel 
talks 
one of the major snags in the talks reportedly had been an sec 
demand that drexel fire michael milken who took a leave of absence 
after he and two others were charged with 98 counts of racketeering 
and securities fraud drexel has a policy that all indicted 
employees must be placed on leave 
milken pleaded innocent friday to the charges and was released 
pending negotiations on setting bond on monday us district 
judge kimba wood rescheduled from tuesday to wednesday a hearing on 
an expected agreement between prosecutors and milkens lawyers on 
posting a bond 
the government reportedly sought under racketeering laws to have 
milken post a 1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on 
assets that may be seized upon conviction 
but a bond arrangement could allow milken to place a substantial 
amount of money in an account to be monitored by the government 
rather than posting the bond baird and lawyers for milken declined 
to comment monday on the bond talks

jurors began deliberation monday in the 
trial of three california businessmen who a prosecutor said were 
involved in bribery cheating and lying in the pentagon 
corruption case 
they cannot wash their hands of their guilt assistant us 
attorney joseph aronica said in his closing arguments before the 
jury began deciding the case but for these defendants the 
grease for the skids would not have flowed aronica said 
but attorneys for the three eugene sullivan dale schnittjer 
and george kaub declared their clients were innocent victims of a 
conspiracy carried out by a ring of private consultants 
stan mortenson schnittjers attorney said his client had no 
stake in this matter he had no incentive to defraud the 
government 
the jury deliberated the case for eight hours monday without 
reaching a decision the panel was sent home and was to return 
tuesday morning 
all three men are former executive vice presidents of teledyne 
electronics in newbury park calif a defense contractor whose 
parent firm teledyne inc has already pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy in the pentagon fraud case 
the defendants are charged with bribery conspiracy and wire 
fraud the third charge stemming from telephone conversations they 
had with a private consultant william parkin who also has pleaded 
guilty 
kaub is also accused of making false statements to the 
government 
during the weeklong trial the jury heard tape recordings of 
conversations that had been monitored by federal agents during the 
course of the operation ill wind investigation into kickbacks 
in the pentagons purchasing system 
so far the three men are the only ones who have been brought to 
trial in the ill wind case which began nearly three years ago 
however at least half a dozen other people have pleaded guilty in 
the case and are cooperating with the government 
summing up the governments case aronica said that parkin was 
hired in november 1985 for 10000 to help teledyne win a 24 
million contract to build handheld radar equipment parkin was to 
be paid an additional 150000 once teledyne landed the job which 
it did in the summer of 1987 
all told parkin received about 28000 before public disclosure 
of the investigation in june 1988 
parkin testified that he and another consultant fred lackner 
paid bribes to stuart berlin a navy engineer for assistance on 
the teledyne contract but defense lawyers said the teledyne 
executives never knew about the scheme 
aronica said as long as no one was blunt and no one blurted 
out bribery and payoffs they felt at ease to be able to 
deny any knowledge to be able to hide behind a veneer of 
deniability 
but he said it would be nonsense for a sophisticated company 
such as teledyne to sign a 150000 back channel agreement with 
a consultant such as parkin when it could get the same information 
from its marketing staff unless parkin was performing other 
illegitimate services that in fact was the case the prosecutor 
said 
this was a case about bribery cheating and lying thats 
exactly what it is he said 
lawyers for the three defendants all said their clients were 
unwitting victims of parkins scheme to defraud the government 
schnittjer who came to the company as a finance supervisor 
several months after teledyne electronics landed the radar 
contract was simply following orders from above when he started 
paying parkin a portion of the 150000 in 1988 mortenson said 
dale schnittjer is innocent the lawyer said 
kaubs lawyer mark tuohey said his client wasnt even in the 
country during much of the time that teledyne electronics was 
working to land the radar contract moreover he said that some of 
the governments witnesses admitted that their aim was to defraud 
teledyne and then hide the ball 
the motive of private consultants parkin and lackner as well as 
berlin was get everything you can and dont tell anybody about 
it he said 
sullivans attorney george oconnell said my client was 
kept in the dark

prime minister noboru takeshita on tuesday 
acknowledged receiving about 1 million from a company at the 
center of a major bribery scandal but he said the funds were only 
donations and not bribes 
takeshitas comments at a meeting of the parliaments budget 
committee reversed statements made previously before parliament 
when he denied ever receiving funds from recruit co an 
information and publishing conglomerate 
recent disclosures of takeshitas financial links to recruit and 
its subsidiaries prompted the prime minister to speak formally 
about his role in the stock profiteering and bribery scandal which 
has involved about 160 politicians businessmen and bureaucrats 
i am feeling political and moral responsibilities very 
strongly takeshita said tuesday i think it is important to 
settle this matter legally and politically 
he said that between 1985 and 1987 recruit donated 130 million 
yen about 1 million to his political support groups in donations 
and purchases of fundraising party tickets japanese law allows a 
company the size of recruit to make political donations of 114000 
a year 
takeshita said the funds were handled strictly as political 
donations and denied opposition claims that they were bribes 
political donations are indispensible elements for vital 
political activities which are said to be the foundation of a 
democratic society he said but the widespread recruit scandal 
and my position as a prime minister no longer allow me to speak in 
such general terms 
opposition lawmaker kanji kawasaki of the japan socialist party 
asked takeshita what his understanding of recruits intentions was 
when he accepted the money 
takeshita replied i am not in a position of telling the 
intent of another partys political donations 
he also denied any personal involvement in transactions of 
bargainpriced unlisted shares in recruits real estate subsidiary 
by his personal secretary and a relative the transactions produced 
about 200000 in profits when the share price soared after 
overthecounter trading began 
to opposition charges that he was reversing earlier statements 
takeshita said i do not remember the details of my statement 
but i probably did not have a clear recollections of the matter 
then 
recent disclosures of the governing liberal democratic partys 
links to the recruit scandal have generated demands from the 
political opposition that takeshita resign and call elections to 
allow the public to give its verdict on the scandal even some 
members of takeshitas own party want him to step down 
your hand is contaminated with money said kawasaki of the 
socialist party you must realize the ethics of japans democracy 
are being questioned you should resign immediately 
the prime minister has refused all demands that he resign 
insisting he will stay in office to carry out political reforms 
three people resigned from takeshitas cabinet after 
acknowledging they had continued to receive recruit donations after 
the scandal erupted last summer but takeshita said he did not 
receive any funds from the firm after 1987 
so far 14 people including two vice ministers have been 
arrested on charges of violating bribery and securities laws in 
connection with the recruit scandal 
no politicians have been arrested but prosecutors have begun to 
question politicians and their aides who received money or bought 
stock from recruit 
public support for takeshita has declined to its lowest level 
since public opinion polls on prime ministers began after the end 
of world war ii in 1945 one poll released monday showed 
takeshitas approval rate at only 78 percent 
the public is not going to be satisfied with your explanations 
today kawasaki told takeshita i think the frustration and 
anger of the public is on the verge of blowing up 
what we want is not an explanation from him takeshita but 
the act of responsibility by resigning immediately yukihisa 
yoshida of the democratic socialist party another major opposition 
group said monday 
leaders of the socialist komeito clean government democratic 
socialist and united social democrat parties met last friday in 
kyoto and agreed to continue pressing for takeshitas resignation 
they also agreed on an outline for a coalition government they hope 
might replace takeshitas administration if he steps down 
the combined opposition lacks sufficient votes in parliament to 
force takeshita to resign or call elections 
but it has brought a complete halt to parliamentary 
deliberations on the nations budget for fiscal 1989 which started 
april 1 before reopening debate the opposition demanded the 
government summon former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone to 
testify on his connections to recruit or alternatively that the 
entire takeshita cabinet resign
