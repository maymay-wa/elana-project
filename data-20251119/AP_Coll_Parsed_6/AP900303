seventy dog teams and mushers were set 
to start the last great race on earth on saturday the grueling 
1100milelong iditarod trail sled dog race from anchorage to nome 
teams were expected to encounter some of the harshest weather in 
the races 18year history said race manager jack niggemyer 
subzero temperatures accompanied by strong winds the heaviest 
snowfall in a quartercentury ash from redoubt volcano and 
starving aggressive moose have combined to make it a tough year to 
race and a tough year to train he said 
awful weather niggemyer said its probably snowed 40 
inches in the last two days 
the race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days the record time set 
by susan butcher of manley alaska in 1987 is 11 days two hours 
and five minutes butcher won the race in 1986 1987 and 1988 
some participants and race observers said they expect this 
years race to be slow going because of the deep snow and 
poorlypacked trail 
we might run out of trail said lavon barve a musher from 
wasilla alaska its up to the mushers to snowshoe or 
whatever he said it will be barves ninth race he finished 
fifth last year 
the iditarod began in 1973 it commemorates the 1925 emergency 
delivery of diphtheria serum to nome on the bering sea the serum 
taken overland by sled dog because airplanes couldnt get through 
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote coastal 
town 
the trail begins in anchorage and heads northwest across the 
giant alaska range and onto the treeless tundra eventually it 
winds along the yukon river to the bering sea 
since 1973 the iditarod has grown in fame and stature this 
year mushers have come from as far as france and switzerland 
companies spend tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor top 
competitors 
rick swenson of two rivers alaska the only person to win the 
iditarod four times will be trying for a fifth win butcher will 
attempt to equal swensons fourtime win record

latvians allege 70000 soviet troops are pouring 
into the baltic republics to skew the voting in the 
independenceminded republics elections in the coming weeks 
a soviet military commander indicated friday that the troops are 
coming into the baltics from czechoslovakia and wont be 
transferred that quickly 
proindependence activists are hoping to win majorities in the 
parliamentary elections in latvia and estonia on march 18 but both 
republics have substantial russian populations who may vote against 
independence candidates a substantial influx of soldiers who can 
vote wherever they are stations could change the balance of power 
the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia already 
have heavy concentrations of troops reportedly one out of every 
eight people in estonia 
lithuanians already have elected a majority of proindependence 
activists to their parliament and runoffs are scheduled 
baltics military commander fyodor kuzmin told the latvian 
legislature friday that the soviet troops being withdrawn from 
czechoslovakia will be transferred to the baltics though not 
necessarily permanently reported anda anspoka of the latvian 
peoples front 
in his comments soviet commander kuzmin reportedly gave no 
timetable for the troops arriving in the baltics however the 
soviets have told the czechoslovaks they need 16 months to withdraw 
all 73500 soldiers because there is no housing for them and their 
families in the soviet union which has a chronic and severe 
housing shortage 
the first units consisting of 22 t62 tanks and 33 armored 
vehicles left czechoslovakia on monday 
peoples front representative janis jurkama said on finnish 
television friday that our information is that they are coming to 
latvia just before the elections and they would vote 
i tell you people are being very nervous and that is why a 
lot of letters have been coming to the supreme soviet legislature 
asking our deputies to express a very strong protest to moscow 
he said 
kuzmin told the latvian legislature that the troops were going 
to lithuania and estonia rather than latvia anspoka said 
disbelieving lawmakers decided to protest to moscow and request 
that no more troops be sent to the baltics she said 
the latvian legislature also passed a law removing judges from 
the control of the communist party a judgeship is now 
incompatible with membership in a political party the official 
soviet news agency tass reported 
the latvian parliament also created a state bank empowered to 
issue currency independent from the soviet ruble tass said

the elderly communists religious liberals 
and social reformers at sunset hall are used to being outnumbered 
but there arent enough left now even to keep the house open 
sunset hall a 36room spanishstyle home for retired radicals 
is being sold for 12 million to a developer who wants to convert 
it into an apartment complex ann maupin president of the board 
governing the home said friday 
residents of the home which is running an annual deficit have 
until march 22 to move out of the 14 residents age 77 to 99 
eight have no place to go or dont want to go the rest have made 
other plans 
its the loss of a very important peoples institution said 
sadie tomkin 89 who once managed the communist newspaper peoples 
world 
if this was a decent society this would never have 
happened she said 
sunset hall residents can count among their brethren former 
resident ruben burroughs editor of upton sinclairs newsletter 
during the socialists 1934 gubernatorial campaign others helped 
form the union backbone for blue collar workers in the united 
states in the 1930s and some fought mccarthyera blacklisting in 
the 1950s 
founded in 1924 by the first unitarian church of los angeles 
sunset hall was designed to house religious liberals the home is 
funded primarily by residents monthly fees and has operated at a 
deficit for almost two decades said administrator thomas e 
brandlin 
it is expected to post an estimated 95000 deficit this year 
its worst ever he said 
residents pay between 900 and 1400 a month although some are 
charged less because of need 
were almost broke brandlin said a big chunk of money 
might help for a while but what sunset hall really needs is to be 
filled up with 30 paying residents 
we need enough residents to bring in 75000 per year or 
fundraising added mrs maupin but thats fundraising at a 
very high level 
she said there are 12 members on the board that governs the 
home with two who want the home to remain open the board is 
elected by the 240 members of the sunset hall nonprofit corp 
which is open to anyone who pays a 35 fee 
to fight the closure attorney kent ten brink said he intends to 
seek a court injunction blocking the planned sale 
residents some who must use canes and walkers have 
participated in recent years in demonstrations in support of the 
los angeles teachers strike and a picket by eastern airline 
workers 
and they say they may fall back on a timeworn strategy and stage 
a demonstration outside sunset hall which features a large 
treeshaded patio a library and a living room equipped with a 
grand piano the day they get evicted 
we have people here who expressed their thinking on world 
events and took part in them said drusilla falk im about the 
youngest here im 78 and when i arrived here four years ago i 
thought maybe i wont have to make any more moves 
waldemar hille wally to friends said the band of old rebels 
is not taking news of the closing lying down 
im a musician by trade and not accustomed to getting mad but 
we do have a lot of people here who are said hille who plays 
piano organ and a little guitar when hes able 
im going to try and keep my place here and quite a few other 
members will too he added but we dont expect miracles 
the 82yearold hille used to accompany singer paul robeson and 
was once a collaborator with folk singer pete seeger he said he 
moved to sunset hall about two years ago 
hille feared that without the intellectual stimulation provided 
by the home some residents may just fade away 
as a musician i can write and practice my instruments hille 
said i can stay alive at least other people arent as fortunate 
as that and they have only to look forward to a single apartment 
some place

black market currency dealers on their 
sidewalk trading floor outside a train station are scrambling for 
east german marks as the nonconvertible currency soars against the 
wests mighty deutsche mark 
germans from both countries and the regions 
wheelinganddealing poles who trade on the black market are facing 
a run on the east german mark amid speculation over a pending 
monetary union between the germanys 
talks are under way on a plan to introduce the west german mark 
as legal tender in east germany and some east german officials 
have called for a 1to1 exchange rate at the outset 
that proposal has brought a sudden switch at the sidewalk 
trading spot 
you can hardly get east marks these days it was a lot easier 
only a week or two ago although the exchange rate is a lot better 
now for sellers said one dealer who identified himself only as 
harald k 
the 24yearold east german who deals in west berlin on his 
days off from the army said east germans a month ago had to pay 20 
east marks for one west mark 
now they can buy one shiny deutsche mark coin for only a green 
5east mark note 
when east germanys communist government opened the berlin wall 
in november the boom in traffic between the nations boosted 
business on the sidewalk exchange in front of the train stop at the 
zoo in west berlin 
a few west germans bought east marks to travel east and buy 
cheap staples like rice pasta and fresh meat or dine like kings 
at subsidized restaurants but most customers were east germans out 
hunting for consumer goods unavailable back home 
now though east marks are in demand and more west germans are 
buying in the hope of turning a quick profit when the nations 
economies are merged as part of a monetary union 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has proposed the union as a 
first step to unification of the countries some west german 
officials also say that east germanys economy is crumbling and 
will collapse without the union 
people are expecting with a currency union the east german 
mark will be exchanged at a 1to1 rate said reinhard pohl a 
monetary expert at west berlins german economic research institute 
pohl said some west germans are trading their convertible 
deutsche marks at the favorable black market rate then depositing 
them with friends or relatives in the east and hoping for the 
favorable exchange rate once economic union is announced 
the east mark has surged 30 percent against the deutsche mark at 
currency trading offices in west berlin and frankfurt and in 
vienna austria and zurich switzerland 
uncertainty over how economic unification will be carried out 
also has made west german stock and bond markets jumpy 
the markets are being driven by emotion speculation and 
politics and thats not going to change before the elections in 
east germany on march 18 said one frankfurt bond trader who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
he said west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper had 
contributed to the speculation friday with a report that east 
german and west german finance officials have agreed to a currency 
union by july 1 
bild said a joint currency commission had decided that east 
germans savings which alone amount to 17 billion east marks in 
bank accounts would be exchanged over an unspecified period of 
time at a 1to1 rate 
for savings that couldnt be swapped immediately for lack of 
ready cash west german interest rates would be paid bild said 
only savings deposited in east german bank accounts before jan 
1 or possibly before nov 9 when the berlin wall was opened 
would be converted it added 
the paper said cash of up to 1000 marks could probably be 
exchanged at a 1to1 rate but that larger amounts would be cashed 
at a less favorable rate 
the east german government declined to comment and the west 
german bundesbank denied the report saying no decisions would be 
made on the conversion rate before the election

psychiatric social worker sophie freud 
granddaughter of sigmund freud the founder of psychoanalysis says 
shes never undergone psychoanalysis and doesnt plan to 
im just the kind of addictive person who would get lost in 
some kind of dependency relationship in analysis she told about 
200 people friday at the university of pittsburgh its too 
dangerous to my psychic makeup 
ms freud 65 is a professor of social work at simmons college 
in boston and a noted therapist 
she poked fun at some of her grandfathers ideas saying for 
example that she doesnt agree with his contention that only men 
are capable of true passion 
women love only themselves with an intensity comparable to 
mans love for them her grandfather wrote in 1914 nor does 
their need lie in the direction of loving but of being loved and 
that man finds favor with them who fulfills this condition 
thats ridiculous ms freud said 
sometimes i question whether men are capable of love she 
joked before the predominantly female audience

using a computerdriven descendant of the player 
piano a music scholar gave new life to more than 100 rare george 
gershwin solos recorded on piano rolls 
it is as if you are being treated to a live performance in 
your living room the scholar artis wodehouse of san francisco 
said friday as she showed off the technology that saved the songs 
gershwin recorded the pieces on rolls for player pianos between 
1916 when he was 17 and 1926 player pianos were the jukeboxes of 
their day wodehouse said and most of the gershwin performances 
were his elaborate arrangements of then popular songs eighteen 
were his original compositions 
sheet music for his compositions and for his arrangements of the 
other pieces did not survive 
wodehouse a pianist herself found 105 of the 120 piano rolls 
through a michigan collector in 1988 she then found a computer 
firm microw distributors inc of butler nj that had developed 
a technology that turns piano rolls into a format computers can 
read 
microw put the gershwin rolls on floppy disks that can be 
played on synthesizers or a computerdriven update of the player 
piano the yamaha disklavier 
on friday the gershwin songs emanated from a disklavier in a 
performance at yamahas communication center in new york 
gershwin would love it wodehouse said he would be 
tickled with the technology he was a great believer in the new 
and he would have been delighted to learn that people still cared 
about his music 
gershwin one of americas greatest composers and a piano 
virtuoso died in 1937 his first big claim to fame came in 1919 
with the release of swanee but his position in the annals of 
music history was secured in 1924 by rhapsody in blue 
a few years ago wodehouse transcribed sheet music for several 
old 78 rpm gerswhin records i went over and over them she 
said it took about 150 hours to transcribe a threeminute 
piece because his arrangements were so elaborate 
when those pieces were published she became wellknown among 
gershwin lovers and about a year ago she won a national endowment 
for the arts grant to study gershwin piano rolls 
microw had just created a technology that could read the piano 
rolls which wodehouse compares to long pieces of toilet paper with 
little pin pricks in them player pianos read the rolls by blowing 
air through the holes triggering hammers inside the pianos 
the computer data was made by taking pictures of images of light

the government is forcing airlines to open the 
skies to the handicapped but says blind people still cant sit 
near the exit door 
transportation department rules requiring more accommodations 
for the disabled on airliners brought immediate criticism from an 
airline industry trade group and from a national organization of 
blind people both said they were considering lawsuits 
the rules call for moveable aisle armrests and more space for 
wheelchairs and require airlines to make other provisions for 
handicapped travelers 
billed as an antidiscrimination measure required by congress 
the rules will cost airlines an estimated 400 million over the 
next 20 years for training personnel and modifying airliner 
interior design to accommodate more disabled people said don 
trilling dot director for regulatory affairs 
you dont treat handicapped passengers differently or force 
restrictions on them unless you have a very good safety grounds for 
doing it said bob ashby a department lawyer who briefed news 
media on the directives that will take effect in about five weeks 
all new airliners with more than 30 seats will be required to 
have moveable armrests on half the aisle seats and widebody 
planes generally those carrying 200 passengers or more must 
have at least one lavatory that can accommodate a handicapped 
passenger 
the rules also strictly limit airlines ability to refuse 
service to handicapped people prohibit any restriction on where 
they can sit except for safety reasons and prevent airlines from 
requiring handicapped passengers to be accompanied by an attendant 
if they do require it the airline must fly the attendant free 
these regulations will ensure that us air carriers provide 
consistent predictable service to disabled travelers without 
discrimination and with accommodations the passengers need said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner the regulations 
accomplish this goal consistent with the safety of all passengers 
the air transport association which represents us carriers 
said the requirements would diminish safety and service for air 
travelers and impose an unacceptable economic burden on the 
airlines and all their customers 
the trade group said requiring 50 percent moveable aisle 
armrests was way out of proportion with the real need to 
accommodate disabled passengers 
another provision that would give both manual and electric 
wheelchairs priority in main cabin storage areas will seriously 
diminish storage space for carryon items of other passengers 
ata said 
airliners built in 1992 or later will be affected and older 
aircraft will have to comply as their interiors are refurbished 
usually about every seven years 
the rules prohibit carriers from restricting seating on the 
basis of handicap except to comply with federal aviation 
administration safety regulations 
an accompanying faa rule limits seating in exit rows to 
passengers who can locate the door quickly follow instructions for 
its use physically open the heavy doors determine whether its 
safe to go out understand both verbal and handsignalled 
instructions from flight attendants and get around obstacles to 
lead other passengers off the aircraft 
tony broderick faa associate administrator said the rule was 
reached reluctantly but does not single out any group 
he said among those prohibited would be parents with small 
children people too frail to operate the door passengers with 
broken legs or other disabilities that would inhibit movement 
obese people and children under 15 as well as people who are blind 
marc maurer spokesman for the national federation of the blind 
said the rule continues a pattern of discrimination the 
department of transportation has permitted airlines to carry on for 
some time 
a bill is pending in congress that would allow blind people to 
sit wherever they want on airliners maurer said the group is also 
considering legal action 
blind people dont need anything in these rules except to be 
left alone maurer said

an explorer on a dog sled trek across 
antarctica disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours as foul weather 
threatened the teams plan to finish the first nonmechanized 
crossing of the continent by saturday 
keizo funatsu the japanese member of the sixman international 
team was found early friday after surviving a night of 70 mph 
winds and 20below temperatures by burrowing into the snow 
when he was found he was yelling im alive he was found 
in very good condition said jennifer gasperini headquarters 
spokeswoman for the minnesotabased expedition 
funatsu disappeared thursday after meeting with a french film 
crew that hauled a mobile home to the teams campsite 16 miles 
from their goal team members roped themselves together and 
searched for six hours they gave up because of darkness but found 
him in the morning after a twohour search ms gasperini said 
it wasnt known if funatsu would be able to complete the last 16 
miles of the trek to the soviet scientific station at mirnyy on 
the eastern antarctic coast under his own power 
the 1990 transantarctica expedition was stalled for a second 
day friday on the last leg of a 3800mile sevenmonth journey by 
dogsled and skis from western antarctica to the eastern coast on 
the indian ocean 
the wind dropped to 30 mph friday afternoon but conditions 
remained too hazardous to risk a final push ms gasperini said 
especially dangerous was a maze of ice crevasses along the route 
they had hoped to end the 11 million corporatesponsored 
journey by 6 am est saturday at mirnyy where they planned to 
meet television crews 
the expedition led by will steger of ely minn and jeanlouis 
etienne of france hopes to parlay interest in the feat into public 
support for preservation of antarctica and to lobby world leaders 
who are reviewing the 1961 antarctic treaty 
team members reached the south pole the halfway mark of their

a bipartisan commissions plan to overhaul the 
nations health care system would provide private or public 
insurance coverage to all americans regardless of whether they can 
afford it 
however the plan already is drawing fire for failing to say how 
the 65 billion annual bill would be paid by taxpayers 
the proposals adopted friday by the us bipartisan commission 
on comprehensive health care are aimed at providing universal 
access to health care and assuring that the elderly and disabled 
will be able to receive care at home or in nursing homes 
sen jay rockefeller dwva chairman of the commission said 
the recommendations to congress respond to a crisis in us health 
care that leaves more than 31 million people without any health 
insurance and an additional 20 million with inadequate coverage 
he called it wrong outrageous morally repugnant that 
americans are denied care in emergencies 
we cant offer easy answers but we can offer a challenge to 
this country he said 
the panel voted 87 for the plan to achieve universal access 
and 114 for the longterm care plan the three members appointed 
by president bush divided 21 in favor of both proposals the other 
12 members of the commission are members of congress 
the commissions plan relies on both increased federal spending 
for health care coverage including a federal takeover of the 
medicaid system now shared with the states and private coverage 
in addition to its estimated 662 billion cost an additional 
20 billion would be paid by private businesses through increased 
contributions to employee health plans or to the public plan 
without a way to pay for it it is a nonstarter it is 
legislatively dead said rep fortney pete stark dcalif a 
member of the panel and chairman of the house subcommittee on 
health 
he criticized the bush administration for failing to provide 
leadership in finding a way to provide health insurance 
sen david durenberger rminn also a member said the plan 
failed to provide any restraints on health care costs 
its going to skyrocket our costs he said 
rockefeller said the plan would need a revenue source that could 
be counted on to increase by 8 percent to 9 percent a year 
automatically because of anticipated rising costs 
the plan would be phased in over five years in its first year 
health care coverage would be extended to all children and pregnant 
women 
the plan would require all businesses with more than 100 
employees to provide private health insurance to their workers or 
to contribute to a public plan for employees and nonworking 
dependents 
smaller businesses would be encouraged to provide insurance 
through tax credits and subsidies but might eventually be required 
to provide coverage if they did not meet targets by the end of the 
fiveyear period 
the longterm care plan would pay the full cost of the first 
three months in a nursing home by anyone regardless of income 
benefits for additional time in a nursing home would be improved 
permitting recipients to keep their homes and certain other assets 
the commission was created in 1988 when congress voted to expand 
medicare catastrophic care coverage that coverage was repealed 
last year after groups representing the elderly abandoned their 
support complaining about the cost 
the commission was called the pepper commission for its first 
chairman the late rep claude pepper dfla it was directed to 
recommend ways to assure health care and how to pay for it

the new united national opposition 
government is planning to turn land seized by the leftist 
sandinistas over to those working it and compensate the previous 
owners uno officials said 
confiscated land now idle will be rented and priority will be 
given to its previous owners said francisco mayorga a senior 
economic adviser to presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro 
mayorga told reporters friday that 40 percent of the nations 
25 million arable acres is owned by the ministry of agrarian 
reform 
people now working that land will get title to it mayorga said 
adding that former owners will be compensated with government bonds 
based on preconfiscation tax values something that may be 
painful for owners who deliberately undervalued their land 
we arent going to throw anybody out of their homes said 
another adviser alfredo cesar the person affected will have to 
petition through mechanisms we will establish 
land ownership is one of the key issues during the transition 
between the sandinistas and mrs chamorros coalition which 
defeated them sunday and will take office april 25 
after ousting dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 the leftist 
sandinistas began nationalizing businesses and expropriating huge 
private farms and ranches as part of a land redistribution plan 
uno campaigned on a freemarket platform that proposed selling 
off state enterprises and increasing private ownership to spur the 
ailing economy the sandinistas who still control the army and 
police said firing public workers or making the banking system 
private could endanger the transition 
mayorga heading monday to the united states to seek assistance 
said the government would have to move fast to help farmers plant 
crops before the may rains 
he said the nation would need 500 million to 600 million in 
annual aid from all sources about what the same as it was 
receiving under president daniel ortega 
the bulk of that aid however came from eastern europe cuba 
and the soviet union sources which were drying up even before the 
uno victory 
also friday a honduran official joined talks got under way to 
discuss disbanding ussupported contra rebels who are based in 
honduras a source close to the talks said the discussions were 
constructive but that there was a long way to go 
both the sandinistas and uno have urged the contras to 
immeditately dismantle their bases and return but the contras said 
must have talks first with mrs chamorros government to guarantee 
their safety 
honduras new president rafael leonardo callejas wants the 
contras out of his nations territory and peace established in the 
region in order to attract foreign investment and get his economy 
back in gear 
every day that goes by that they are not dismantled the 
situation becomes more explosive because it is interfering with the 
normal transition said alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of 
the foreign ministry in an interview with reporters friday 
meanwhile mrs chamorro said that transition negotiations 
overall were going smoothly 
its all going peacefully very peacefully mrs chamorro 
said in a brief interview 
bendana said the sandinistas would turn over full powers of the 
executive to mrs chamorro 
transition talks are focusing on control of the sandinista army 
and interior ministry security forces which the sandinistas dont 
want to reduce until the contras disband 
including the army security and militias those forces are 
about 150000 strong uno wants to reduce them sharply and 
eliminate the draft 
that position was already enticing some soldiers to desert in 
anticipation of mrs chamorros inauguration 
when asked why there was negotiation if the sandinistas were 
willing to give up control bendana said that was part of the 
political process 
yes youre going to have a tug of interests but thats what 
democracy is all about said bendana 
despite the sandinista leaderships conciliatory attitude 
discontent continued to appear at lower levels of the party 
outside the city of masaya 17 miles southeast of managua a 
group of at least a dozen armed men occupied an abandoned stone 
fort once used as a prison by somoza 
at another location near masaya the head of a seized operation 
that grows a variety of crops and gins cotton said workers there 
would not give the business up to private ownership 
esteban correa a sandinista loyalist who manages the operation 
said he had 50 rifles and was asking the party for more

here are key points in the pepper commissions 
recommendations for health care 
the recommendations fall into two areas access to health care 
and longterm care 
accessequals 
businesses with 100 or fewer employees would be encouraged to 
provide health insurance for their employees and nonworking 
dependents tax credits and subsidies would be available and 
selfemployed and unincorporated businesses could deduct 100 
percent of premiums 
employers who buy coverage and achieve a specified coverage 
target would not be required to participate in the federal public 
health insurance plan 
all businesses with more than 100 employees must provide 
private health insurance for a specified package of benefits or 
contribute to the public plan for all employees and nonworking 
dependents 
the public plan would cover employees and dependents that 
contribute and nonworking individuals who buy in or are 
subsidized it would replace medicaid and pay providers according 
to medicare rules it would be financed and administered primarily 
by the federal government although states could opt to administer 
it 
the minimum benefit package includes primary and preventive 
care physician and hospital care and other services there would 
be costsharing with subsidies for lowincome people and limits on 
outofpocket spending 
at full implementation all americans would be required to have 
health insurance through their employer or the public plan 
the plan contains a provision that could require the secretary 
of health and human services to submit to congress a plan for 
insuring any remaining uninsured employees of small companies after 
five years 
longtermequals 
severely disabled people of all ages would be eligible for 
social insurance for home and communitybased care 
a nursing home program would be established providing 
protection so that no one must be impoverished before receiving 
covered longterm care individuals could keep their homes and 
30000 in assets couples could keep up to 60000 
the federal and state governments would share financial 
responsibility for the nursing home program the federal government 
would finance the home and communitybased care program and the 
first three months of care 
states are responsible for cost containment quality assurance 
and consumer protection 
private longterm care insurance fills gaps not covered by the 
plan subject to government standards

irreplaceable scientific information from us 
space missions is in danger because of the deplorable 
conditions in which nasa allows hundreds of thousands of magnetic 
tapes to be stored a congressional agency says 
the general accounting office an arm of congress that audits 
the performance of federal agencies said friday that investigators 
found tapes in dusty hallways and in a basement where some had been 
partially submerged by a flood 
the national aeronautics and space administration in a letter 
signed by john e obrien assistant deputy administrator told the 
gao we take strong exception to the implication that nasa is 
not safeguarding the space science data as a national resources for 
future generations 
we believe that the tone of the report is unnecessarily harsh 
and contains sweeping generalizations and extrapolations which we 
believe to be unfounded and unsubstantiated obrien said 
nasa said it had experienced no significant loss of scientific 
data as identified by our science customers it also said its own 
testing has shown a more than satisfactory preservation of data 
the gao in turn rejected nasas criticism and said there was 
reason for concern that data stored on the tapes is at serious 
risk of becoming partially or completely unusable 
the congressional monitors said they had visited 10 tape storage 
and processing facilities and had found that eight failed to comply 
with at least two of the regulations established by the national 
archives and records administration for the handling of magnetic 
tapes 
in a summary of its findings the gao said hundreds of 
thousands of tapes containing space science data are stored under 
deplorable conditions 
five of the facilities lacked adequate temperature and 
humidity control fire protection water protection or tape 
maintenance the congressional agency said 
in some instances gao found tapes stored in hallways 
basements and dusty warehouses not designed for tape storage for 
example in one major facility gao found nearly 300000 tapes 
packed in boxes covered by dust and stacked on shipping pallets 
in one place the agency said it found more than 4000 tapes 
stored in a dirty basement that had been flooded in 1985 
submerging approximately half of some of the tapes and leaving a 
film of debris on them 
the gao said that some of the most significant tape management 
deficiencies were found in the two largest facilities the 
national space science data center at the goddard space flight 
center in greenbelt md which stores more than 113000 magnetic 
tapes and the tape staging and storage facility in landover md 
which stores and tracks more than 860000 tapes 
by contrast the agency said the us geological surveys eros 
data center in sioux falls sd and the digital equipment corps 
data protection services in dominguez hills calif were in full 
or partial compliance with federal standards and industry 
guidelines 
other facilities visited were the national archives los angeles 
federal records center in laguna niguel calif and its washington 
national records center the smithsonian astrophysical observatory 
washington the multimission image processing facility of the jet 
propulsion laboratory and the infrared processing and analysis 
center of the california institute of technology both in pasadena 
calif and the center for astrophysics and space sciences of the 
university of california at san diego in la jolla calif

space explorers will have to use nuclear power 
on mars and the national science council says the united states 
should study employing nuclear rockets to get travelers to the 
planet 
in a friday report to vice president dan quayle the council 
acknowledged formidable barriers of public acceptance to the 
use of nuclear power in space 
however it said the use of such power eventually will be 
essential on both the moon and mars because of heavy energy 
demands 
it also recommended testing and possibly a demonstration in 
space of the feasibility of sending rockets to mars by nuclear 
propulsion 
the report analyzed a study done by the national aeronautics and 
space administration as part of president bushs initiative to put 
bases on the moon and mars early in the next century 
among its findings 
nasa needs to study the effects of longterm space flight on 
human beings because on the basis of present knowledge a 
multiyear exposure to weightlessness even with onboard exercise 
and countermeasures and an intermediate stay on the surface of 
mars presents unacceptable risks to the crew 
operation of a us space station by the late 1990s as 
scheduled is a reasonable assumption but plans for the station 
are not adequate for a moonmars mission the station may not be 
the most appropriate staging base for the moon and mars and it is 
possible that an additional station will eventually become 
necessary 
although the nasa proposals envision bases on mars it 
appears that a station in mars orbit requires a less demanding 
infrastructure than a surface base and might serve a useful purpose 
in the early stages of human space exploration 
possibilities for international cooperation should be explored 
because breakthroughs have been made in europe japan and elsewhere 
and most importantly the ussr has substantial relevant 
capability demonstrated continued interest in mars and an 
apparent strong desire for cooperation with the us in mars 
exploration 
the councils study made by a 14member committee named in 
january said nuclear rockets would reach mars in onehalf to 
onethird the time needed for singlestage chemical propulsion 
systems unmanned spacecraft have made the 111 million mile voyage 
to mars in six months 
the use of nuclear technology in space faces formidable 
barriers of public acceptance however especially if employed in 
earth orbit the council said therefore issues of safety are 
paramount in research and development 
it said one type of nuclear technology known as the nerva 
class is available for fullscale development and should be 
evaluated for injection to mars in competition with hydrogenoxygen 
chemical systems 
if careful systems studies show a significant advantage 
for nuclear rockets in trip time or in weight to orbit an inspace 
demonstration of this technology should be done as soon as 
possible the council said 
it will not be feasible to select the nuclear rocket as a 
baseline in a system architecture until such a demonstration has 
been conducted 
after announcing the moonmars initiative july 20 the 20th 
anniversary of the first moon landing bush asked quayle chairman 
of the national space council to explore ways of carrying it out 
nasa made a 90day study and quayle asked the national research 
council an arm of the congressionally chartered national academy 
of sciences to evaluate it

city leaders had hoped a street named 
after slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr would foster 
feelings of hope and pride but now they worry the backlash will 
sully portlands image 
the street name has been met with an organized opposition led by 
a conservative political veteran a white supremacist leader joined 
the opponents and they collected 52435 signatures on a ballot 
initiative to reverse the name change 
a judge nixed their drive on wednesday but the opponents 
appealed friday with the oregon supreme court in hopes of meeting a 
march 15 deadline to put the initiative on the may 15 primary 
ballot 
a civic leader says that the controversy combined with the 1988 
beating death of an ethiopian immigrant by a group of neonazi 
skinheads may give blacks second thoughts about moving to the 
city three men have received long prison sentences for the beating 
death 
unfortunately i think the city is going to take a bad rap 
over this particularly as we try to attract other people of color 
to portland said bernie foster a member of a citizens 
committee that recommended the king street name you have to ask 
what kind of message are we sending 
if the story has a familiar ring it is because the same drama 
has been played out in seattle san diego and austin texas 
in seattle a 1983 decision to rename a street martin luther 
king way was upheld by the washington supreme court 
in san diego voters decided to strip kings name from a major 
street and return to the former name of market street and in 
austin a court decision to overturn a 1975 street name change was 
upheld by a municipal appeals court the king name was adopted in a 
separate action a year later 
portlands martin luther king jr boulevard is a 7mile street 
on the citys east side formerly known as union avenue it is a 
thoroughfare notorious for crime and prostitution 
the citizens committee that recommended the name change hoped it 
would symbolize hope stimulate pride and eventually lead to the 
streets revitalization 
the city council voted unanimously to approve the name change 
last april mayor bud clark was among the supporters 
but when city officials and black leaders celebrated the name 
change last summer rosalie huss and two dozen others picketed the 
crowd and heckled speakers 
the city council made a big mistake mrs huss told 
reporters and they will probably have to pay for it with egg on 
their faces 
mrs huss the executive director of the citizens for union 
avenue campaign maintains the name change was forced on an 
unwilling public 
two separate polls showed voters were leaning 21 in favor of 
the initiative which was to have appeared on the may 15 primary 
ballot 
john baxter treasurer of citizens for union avenue is another 
leading opponent of the king street name he compares king to betty 
crocker 
she was not a real person either baxter says 
mrs huss who owns no property and has no business interests on 
the street says her only stake is that of a concerned citizen 
she and her husband walter however have a history of 
opposition to the civil rights leader that stretches back 30 years 
in the 1960s the husses published a rightwing newspaper that 
frequently linked kings activities to communist causes 
huss denies any implication that her grassroots campaign is 
racially motivated she also says her group neither sought nor 
welcomed the support of nationalist movement leader richard 
barrett a white supremacist who visited portland last month to 
campaign for union avenue 
the legal issue in portland was whether the city council action 
had been legislative setting policy or administrative 
implementing a policy already in place 
multnomah county circuit judge harl haas agreed with king 
boulevard supporters that the councils decision was 
administrative only legislative decisions are subject to 
initiative review under oregon law

the senate ethics committee says its 
investigating more than 100 paid appearances by sen dave 
durenberger in 198586 along with gifts of limousine service 
valued at nearly 5000 
a committee letter to the minnesota republican released friday 
disclosed new details of an investigation into durenbergers book 
promotion deal and the limousine trips 
the committee voted last week to hold triallike proceedings to 
determine whether senate rules were violated by durenberger or 
whether any of his actions should be referred to the justice 
department for a criminal investigation 
the panels letter was a formal notice of the action and a 
statement of possible violations a notice required by committee 
rules 
i will continue to cooperate fully with the committee and will 
present evidence demonstrating that there was no intent on my part 
to violate or circumvent senate rules durenberger said after 
receiving the letter 
the committee revealed for the first time it is investigating 
113 paid appearances by durenberger in 198586 described by the 
senator as book promotions that should not have counted toward the 
senates outside income limits durenberger said his purpose was to 
sell his books on defense and health issues 
durenberger may have violated two federal laws the 
committee said when he arranged to charge fees for his speeches 
give the money to his publisher and have the publisher pay him 
100000 the arrangement was not counted in the outside income 
limits 
some of the organizations that invited durenberger to speak said 
they considered the appearances standard speeches by a senator and 
that book sales were not mentioned paid speeches by senators in 
their official capacities are counted toward the outside earnings 
limits which have changed over the years 
the committee letter said durenberger may have violated 
senate rules and the ethics in government act by failing to 
disclose in a timely fashion the travel expense reimbursements he 
received from 43 appearances the committee previously had not 
disclosed the number of reimbursements under investigation 
durenberger amended his annual financial disclosure forms in 
july to include the reimbursement information on what he called 
book promotion appearances he took the action only after the 
committees investigation was under way 
durenberger may have violated senate rules the committee said 
by accepting gifts of limousine service on 21 occasions in 
198586 for a value of 4935 durenberger has said the limousines 
provided by private organizations shuttled him between official 
appearances in boston and his marriage counselor in concord mass 
the committee had not previously revealed the number or value of 
the limousine trips 
the panel said its investigating whether you may have 
converted a campaign contribution to your personal use in 
violation of senate rules and failed to report and deposit the 
5000 donation in violation of federal law 
the letter revealed for the first time the check was written

with tempers rising in israel the state 
department is trying to smooth over a dispute with prime minister 
yitzhak shamir about the settlement of soviet jewish refugees on 
the predominantly arab west bank and in gaza 
but diplomatic sources familiar with israels views said friday 
that differences over a 400 million us loan guarantee and 
bakers giving a clean bill of health to the palestine 
liberation organization on terrorism could make it very difficult 
for shamir to agree to opening mideast negotiations 
the sources declining to be identified said shamir had been 
prepared to recommend the israeli government approve in principle a 
threeway meeting among baker and the egyptian and israeli foreign 
ministers but now the sources said that would be almost 
impossible 
shamir is due to meet with leaders of his governing likud 
political coalition tonight and with foreign minister moshe arens 
finance minister shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin on 
sunday 
the sessions are critical to bakers fivemonth drive to launch 
negotiations by meeting here with arens and egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid and then having israelis meet with 
palestinians in cairo 
obviously there are some tough decisions that have to be 
made said margaret d tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman we hope that we will be able to take the next step 
to implement the prime ministers initiative 
she referred to shamirs plan for elections among the 14 
million to 17 million palestinians who live on the west bank and 
in gaza the winners would negotiate with israel a trial period of 
limited selfrule to be followed by broader talks on an overall 
agreement five years later 
baker has endorsed the plan as a starting point for 
negotiations however he has been stymied by a dispute between 
israel and egypt over the composition of the palestinian delegation 
and the agenda for the cairo meeting 
on thursday testifying before a house subcommittee baker took 
two steps that stirred controversy in jerusalem 
he said the bush administration could not extend a 400 million 
guaranteed loan to israel for housing for soviet jewish refugees if 
they were settled on the west bank or in gaza as about 100 of the 
thousands of new immigrants have been 
also baker said he was satisfied that plo chairman yasser 
arafat was adhering to his december 1988 renunciation of terrorism 
against israel baker said there was no evidence of arafats 
complicity or acquiescence in terrorism since then 
the pledge and arafats acknowledgement of israels existence 
prompted the reagan administration to open talks with the plo in 
tunisia 
in the ensuing furor in israel over bakers testimony the state 
department on friday emphasized bakers support for the shamir plan 
and for jewish emigration 
ms tutwiler said baker had called shamir late in the afternoon 
after testifying to underscore that the shamir plan was the 
centerpiece of us diplomacy on the arabisraeli dispute 
however the us official reiterated that the us loan 
guarantee which is in addition to 3 billion in annual us aid to 
israel depended on some assurances the housing would not be 
used by soviet jews settled on the west bank and in gaza 
asked about shamirs reply ms tutwiler said i cannot 
characterize for you that the secretary has received assurances 
but she said there was no indication in the conversation 
that the prime minister was unhappy with the testimony ms 
tutwiler said baker had decided to call shamir on wednesday and it 
had nothing to do with his testimony 
trying to accentuate the positive ms tutwiler said the prime 
minister once again thanked secretary baker for all of his tireless 
efforts and the amount of time he has devoted to trying to 
implement shamirs plan 
yossi ahimeir an aide to shamir confirmed in jerusalem there 
was a call from baker but disagreed with ms tutwilers 
description 
the prime minister expressed his resentment about the 
connection baker made between immigration and settlement he 
said there was a long talk about the whole issue 
ahimeir would not elaborate 
on a related issue the state department late friday criticized 
israel for requiring that all material on immigration of soviet 
jews be submitted to the military censor before publication 
our position on freedom of the press and censorship is 
wellknown the department said in a statement we are 
inquiring further into the details

congressional panels that strongly criticize 
the navys conclusion that gunners mate clayton hartwig likely set 
off the uss iowa explosion fault the service for reaching a tenuous 
hypothesis 
the navys finding of a cause for the april 19 explosion that 
killed 47 sailors including hartwig is based on evidence 
inadequate to support the conclusion the panels said in a 
48page report released friday 
the two groups within the house armed services committee the 
investigations subcommittee and defense policy panel cited what 
lawmakers said were four major flaws in the navy inquiry the 
structure of the investigation technical tests police work and 
psychological analysis 
by the standards of this subcommittee and the standards that 
we think should have been applied in the navys investigation 
there is only a hypothesis and a tenuous one at that the report 
said 
the navy concluded in its september report that hartwig most 
likely caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator 
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch guns 
navy officials acknowledged then that their evidence was 
circumstantial since hartwig and all the witnesses were killed 
the navy said in statement friday that it stands by its 
conclusion that the explosion was the result of the wrongful 
intentional act most probably committed by hartwig 
this conclusion was reached after an intensive investigation 
during which the navy conducted more than 20000 technical tests 
and ruled out possible accidental causes including mechanical 
failure friction propellant instability and personnel error 
the navy said 
ellis rubin a miami lawyer representing former gunners mate 
kendall truitt who was linked to the blast in several news 
reports said truitts family was gratified an official agency of 
the government has cleared up this matter 
truitt was the beneficiary of hartwigs insurance policy 
congress is finally ruling on what weve known all along 
truitt said from the restaurant where he works in land olakes 
fla thank god for objective congressmen 
the new report uss iowa tragedy an investigative failure 
summarizes many of the complaints house members raised in december 
during three days of hearings into the explosion 
the only thing more tragic than the deaths of the 47 young 
seamen last april was the navys failure to conduct a proper 
investigation of the event rep nicholas mavroules dmass 
chairman of the investigations subcommittee said in a statement 
issued with the reports release 
the congressional report faulted the navy for conducting a 
oneman inquiry and never upgrading to a board of investigators 
when it became clear that the explosion cause might have been 
criminal not technical 
in addition it wasnt until may 8 nearly three weeks after 
the blast that the naval investigative service focused on the 
possibility of a criminal act the report said 
at this time nis was faced with a contaminated crime 
scene no chain of custody for evidence and a virtual inability to 
conduct a proper criminal inquiry from an evidentiary standpoint 
the report said 
the congressional report also questioned the navys selective 
use of information from the fbi 
the service asked the fbi to corroborate the findings of the 
navys technical team regarding the possibility a timing device 
caused the blast but when the fbi was unable to back up that 
finding the navy did not use the report deemed it inconclusive 
and told the fbi that additional tests were unnecessary the 
congressional report said 
at the same time the panels attacked the psychological analysis 
conducted by the fbi and cited the assessment of 10 of 14 experts 
the subcommittees consulted who determined that the fbi analysis 
was invalid 
three fbi psychologists testified in december that hartwig 
based on his letters interviews with the seamans family and 
friends and his personal history was egocentric shy not 
sufficiently aggressive had a low selfesteem that added up to 
a suicidal loner

chancellor helmut kohl proposed a 
treaty guaranteeing polands western border if the warsaw 
government confirms german minority rights and a 1953 renunciation 
of war reparations 
polands prime minister responded by saying he is astonished 
by the demands 
while kohls offer friday was apparently intended to defuse 
domestic and international criticism over the borders of a single 
germany polish officials said it only broadened the dispute over 
unification 
facing close elections in december kohl has tried to appease a 
minority of west german voters who want to lay claim to some or all 
of germanys prewar borders which would encompass onethird of 
modernday poland 
on friday demonstrators in warsaw marched for a second day in 
support of prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis demand that poland 
take part in international talks on a unified germany 
demonstrations were held in six cities thursday 
mazowiecki told west german television friday night 
this hour which is very important for the germans the hour of 
the reunification process is not just a german hour it it is an 
hour of europe of germanys neighbors 
earlier friday kohls government offered an eventual treaty 
guaranteeing polands western border after german unification but 
linked it to confirmation of polands 1953 decision not to seek war 
reparations 
such a treaty also would be tied to reassurances of polands 
pledge to protect the rights of its german minority said west 
german government spokesman dieter vogel 
kohl has come under intense criticism for his stance on lands 
east of the oder and neisse rivers ceded to poland after nazi 
germanys 1945 defeat 
poland wants reassurance that once germany is united it will not 
seek to reclaim those lands poland in turn lost some of its 
eastern territory to the soviet union after the war 
mazowiecki has also demanded that poland be included in the 
talks on german unification between the two german states and the 
victorious world war ii allies the soviet union the united 
states britain and france the process was announced last month in 
ottawa 
kohl has repeatedly said germans have no designs on the 
territory but has insisted that final say can only come from a 
future united german government 
mazowiecki after hearing of kohls latest position said 
there is no reason to think we wont keep our word on 
guaranteeing the ethnic rights of polands german minority 
he also said poland sees no reason to expand the scope of the 
border issue 
but if bonn wants to expand the problem please we also have 
something to say for example theres the question of compensation 
for polish forced laborers in the third reich said mazowiecki 
west germanpolish relations have been sensitive for much of the 
postwar period mainly because of uneasy feelings that still linger 
51 years after nazi germanys 1939 invasion of poland east 
germanys communist premier hans modrow has backed mazowieckis 
demand for a place in the talks 
for the first time friday kohl openly said both germanys could 
conclude a treaty that would recognize polands western border for 
a united germany 
but at the same time he demanded polands 1953 decision on war 
reparations be an element of such agreement as well as polands 
assurance last year that the ethnic rights of its german minority 
would be guaranteed 
in the statement delivered by vogel kohl also again avoided 
stating outright that a united germany would claim to land ceded to 
poland 
according to vogel kohl reiterated his support for both german 
parliaments passing an identical declaration pledging to respect 
the current borders after east germany elects its first freely 
chosen parliament on march 18 
vogel said such a declaration must at the same time make clear 
that the august 23 1953 declaration of the polish government in 
which reparations against germany are renounced continues 
unchanged 
the western powers ended reparations collections from west 
germany in 1952 the soviet union did the same for fellow communist 
state east germany a year later while poland also said it would 
not seek reparations 
vogel said that on the basis of a border resolution by the 
german parliaments a treaty between an overall german government 
with the polish government should be concluded and be ratified by a 
united german parliament

a kgb defector who is looking for a publisher 
for the book hes written is going public with tales of alleged 
soviet involvement in a plot to kill the pope and spies inside the 
state department 
victor ivanovich sheymov once kgb agent 04035 said friday that 
in the late 1970s the soviet union had two sources inside the state 
department able to deliver secret information on us policy and 
negotiating positions 
but he said he had no idea who they might be 
he also said he was present in the warsaw station of the kgb in 
1979 when a cable arrived from moscow ordering what he believed to 
be the initial stages of a plot to assassinate pope john paul ii 
nearly a decade after the cia arranged his disappearance from 
moscow on may 15 1980 sheymov 43 held a news conference to tell 
at least some of his story in public and to announce i have 
written a book and am thinking how to publish it 
after a 78minute session in which he dodged or declined to 
answer questions on specific soviet espionage activities sheymov 
passed out business cards bearing the name victor orlov which he 
has used for the last decade 
his most sensational allegation was that while on a trip to 
poland in 1979 the chief of the kgbs warsaw station showed him a 
cable from yuri andropov then the kgbs chief reading obtain 
all the information possible on how to get physically close to the 
pope 
in kgb slang it was clearly indicated that there was only one 
reason to get close to a person and that was to assassinate him 
kill him he said 
allegations of soviet involvement in a plot to murder the pope 
surfaced after an attempt on the pontiffs life in 1981 by a 
turkish gunman no connection to moscow was ever firmly established 
sheymov a former kgb major and communications expert whose 1980 
defection was kept secret for a decade said he told his story to 
the cia but does not know what was done with the information 
sheymov told the news conference that the soviet spy agency had 
two sources inside the state department 
he was asked to provide specifics and declined saying i 
cannot comment on these kinds of matters 
he said that the information received from the alleged spies 
included policy matters positions on negotiations outlines of 
arms control positions 
when asked for a reaction to sheymovs allegations david denny 
a state department spokesman said as a matter of policy we do 
not comment on intelligence matters such as this 
the department is trying to fire felix s bloch a career 
diplomat suspected of spying for the soviet union no charges have 
been brought against bloch who was reportedly videotaped passing a 
suitcase to a soviet agent in paris 
asked if he knew for certain that bloch was a spy sheymov 
replied i cannot answer that question 
in his meeting with reporters sheymov wore tinted glasses and 
what appeared to be a bushy blond wig 
the defector answered many questions with nonresponsive 
oneliners 
i live in a wonderful section of the country he replied 
when asked where he resided 
when asked how much he had been paid by the cia he replied 
are you a salesman for mutual funds 
what had he told his neighbors when they asked about his 
background 
i told them i was not who i was he said i lied

sen bob doles dog missed a date with the 
doctor and that has some people howling in protest 
leader the power pooch owned by the senate minority leader and 
labor secretary elizabeth dole became a media star earlier this 
week when the schnauzer was displayed at a capitol news conference 
along with a litter of his puppies 
but it seems that leader wasnt supposed to become a daddy 
the doles adopted the dog from the washington humane society in 
november 1984 the adoption contract required that leader be 
neutered within seven days but it hasnt happened yet more than 
five years later 
proof came from the doles when they unveiled the litter of eight 
puppies sired by leader the other half of the canine couple was a 
schnauzer owned by sen strom thurmond rsc 
jean johnson executive director of the washington humane 
society was reluctant to discuss the case but confirmed friday 
that the organization is working with the doles on how best to 
resolve our concerns 
its put us in a most awkward situation because were very 
strong proponents of sterilization and making every effort not to 
contribute to the animal overpopulation problem johnson said 
walt riker press secretary for the kansas republican couldnt 
explain why the doles failed to neuter their dog but he said the 
doles have no plans for more puppies and emphasized that the 
thurmonddole litter would go to loving homes 
hes not on the loose which made this a selective 
breeding riker said of leader it wasnt like he was roaming 
the streets of washington creating litters all over town 
according to johnson the standard policy is for an adult dog 
such as leader to be neutered before the wouldbe owners take the 
animal home but exceptions are made on a rare occasion she 
said 
after the sevenday deadline passed in 1984 the humane society 
asked the doles to follow through with the neutering johnson 
declined to say whether there were more reminders 
one animal welfare activist said the case was troubling because 
of the widespread publicity about the puppies and their prominent 
owners 
this is a slight case of somebody who makes laws for all of 
us not obeying this one said kay richter who helps find homes 
for unwanted dogs in the washington area

the food and drug administration says the drug 
azt may be recommended for adults infected with the virus that 
causes aids even if the patients dont have symptoms of the disease 
the drug has been used for three years to treat patients 
severely ill with aids and related problems 
the studies and the change in labeling mean that better 
treatment can now be offered to thousands of people at earlier 
stages of infection with the aids virus before their health 
deteriorates critically health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan said in a statement 
fda on friday approved new labels expanding the drugs use after 
two federally sponsored studies showed that azt slowed progress of 
the disease when administered to infected patients with early 
symptoms or none at all 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and 
burroughs wellcome co the drug manufacturer conducted trials 
involving 2000 volunteers azt was shown to slow down the progress 
of aids while causing far fewer severe side effects than those 
suffered by patients in advanced stages of the disease 
the fda move should make it easier for patients to obtain 
reimbursement under their health insurance policies said burroughs 
wellcome vice president jr whitehead 
earlier this year the fda approved a labeling change that cut in 
half the recommended adult dose of azt the change reduced both the 
frequency of side effects and the cost of treatment to patients 
on oct 26 the fda approved the use of azt for children with 
advanced cases of aids the expanded application announced friday 
applies to adults only but an agency spokesman said the question 
of making azt treatment available earlier to hivinfected children 
is expected to come up at an fda advisory meeting later this month 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that 
attacks the bodys immune system rendering it incapable of 
resisting other diseases and infections 
as of dec 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 117781 
americans of whom 60 percent or 70313 have died since june 1 
1981

a judge set aside a 432 million judgment 
against toyota and ordered a new trial in a civil case brought by a 
woman who watched her husband two daughters and two other people 
burn to death in a 1982 car fire 
arthur c lesher jr a retired state district judge overturned 
the dec 14 ruling after a threehour hearing friday 
in an interview later lesher said i found that in the 
interest of justice and fairness it should be tried again he 
would not elaborate 
lesher presided over the sixweek trial against torrance 
califbased toyota motor sales usa inc last fall a jury found 
toyota negligent in the design of its 1973 corona station wagon 
on dec 29 lesher signed off the jurys award of 182 million 
in actual damages and 25 million in exemplary damages to nike 
adegbite 36 whose husband and two daughters died in the burning 
car along with two others 
the 432 million judgment was the largest award ever entered 
against the japanese car company 
texas courts on occasion call retired judges back to the bench 
because of a statewide case backlog 
houston attorney stan pfeiffer who represents mrs adegbite 
was angered by fridays ruling 
this trial judge has felt compelled for whatever reason to 
completely ignore the findings of the jury pfeiffer said 
there was no substantive complaint about the trial procedure 
alleged by toyota nor that this jury was being unreasonable 
but douglas m west toyotas vice presidentgeneral counsel for 
product law said the company believed the verdict and the size of 
the damage award were unfair 
we felt taken as a whole the evidence presented to the 
jurors did not support the finding of a defect in the 1973 model 
and it did not support the damages that were awarded particularly 
the 25 million in punitive damages west said by telephone from 
california 
during the trial pfeiffer said the sept 26 1982 accident 
happened when the driver of the toyota station wagon boyo adetoye 
tried to steer off a roadway because he had a flat tire and his 
car was struck by a van 
the impact pushed the station wagons fuel tank forward and the 
tank was punctured by an empty spare tire carrier and a valve on 
the rear axle pfeiffer said in december 
the car burst into flames adetoye and mrs adegbite escaped 
with burns and minor injuries but adetoyes wife and child were 
killed the fire as were mrs adegbites husband and two children 
adetoye has settled with toyota for an undisclosed sum 
west argued that the accident was extremely violent and far 
beyond the kind of accidents that can be designed for 
but jury foreman larry phipps said he was very much 
astounded that the verdict was overturned 
its almost as though several weeks of going down there to 
the courthouse daily was just thrown down the drain for no 
apparent reason phipps said i do feel the jury did fulfill 
their responsibility as prescribed by the court and rendered their 
decision in good faith

irancontra prosecutors are trying to block a 
court appeal by richard secord until a lower court judge decides 
whether to reinstate 11 other criminal charges against him 
secord a retired air force major general pleaded guilty nov 8 
to making a false statement when he told congressional 
investigators he was unaware of any money that went to benefit 
oliver north 
but secord announced his intention to appeal after his 
sentencing jan 24 and the government says he is trying to 
circumvent his plea agreement with the government under that plea 
agreement the government agreed not to pursue 11 other criminal 
charges against secord 
the appeal is based on a contention by secords lawyers that 
independent counsel lawrence walsh lacks jurisdiction to prosecute 
for an offense arising out of secords testimony to congress 
irancontra prosecutors feb 5 asked us district court judge 
aubrey robinson to reconsider his decision dismissing the 11 other 
charges 
while the district court has before it important questions 
relating to the effectiveness of the plea agreement in this case 
the appeals court proceedings should be stopped prosecutors said 
in a court filing friday

a letter in which the late malcolm forbes 
offers jokingly to vote on behalf of the dead for rudy boschwitz 
startled the senators staffers when it arrived in boschwitzs 
office this week 
the letter written on stationery from forbes new york office 
was dated feb 14 but did not arrive in the washington dc 
office until monday two days after forbes died in his sleep at age 
70 said boschwitzs press secretary tim droogsma 
forbes apparently wrote the letter to say he would not be able 
to appear at a fundraiser for the republican senator droogsma 
said but in a bit of oddly prescient humor forbes also referred 
to the old vote fraud practice of casting the votes of dead people 
im certainly supportive and if you can locate a tombstone or 
two for me to vote from ill be happy to forbes wrote 
droogsma said the letter elicited a lot of oohs in the 
boschwitz office

stranded greyhound bus passengers were running out of money and 
patience waiting for buses to roll past lines of angry pickets 
after drivers went on strike against the only nationwide bus 
company 
the strikes first day was mostly peaceful but in chicago two 
people were slightly injured on friday by flying glass when a 
sniper fired two shots at a greyhound bus leaving the city 
illinois state police said 
greyhound lines inc said it was operating 20 percent of its 
system with 700 newly hired replacement drivers plus an 
unspecified number of union drivers who crossed picket lines 
passengers on a bus arriving in des moines iowa early friday 
also said strikers fired four shots at their bus as it left a 
chicago depot 
there were scattered reports of angry confrontations between 
strikers and replacement drivers in other cities union leaders 
appealed for calm 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions which 
represents more than 9000 employees including all 6300 drivers 
and most maintenance and office workers went on strike friday 
after negotiators in scottsdale ariz failed to reach agreement 
on wage issues 
in all the company said 1100 unionrepresented employees came 
to work greyhound said it would increase operations as more 
replacements become available 
no talks were scheduled and negotiators were planning to return 
home 
passengers meanwhile tried to figure out how to get home some 
angrily denounced the company for not warning of the strike 
im stuck here and i dont know what to do said alvira 
sheffield who left from maine on thursday and spent the night in 
the port authority bus terminal in new york city they knew about 
the strike i dont know why they let me board the bus 
greyhound spokeswoman elizabeth hale said obviously we have 
not lived up to our expectations of making sure that our passengers 
were taken care of 
i am sorry and it certainly was not intentional to leave 
anyone where they didnt want to be 
greyhound serves 9500 destinations including 9000 where it is 
the only intercity transportation available the company offers the 
cheapest form of such transportation including an advance purchase 
oneway fare of 68 anywhere in the country and the strike 
stranded many poor people trying to leave or return home to smaller 
communities 
in omaha neb about 60 people many passengers on 
coasttocoast trips filled the small downtown bus terminal 
where babies sat on blankets in car seats and in the arms of 
parents walking around luggage bags and boxes 
amtrak told agents to honor greyhound tickets when buses are 
unavailable railroad spokeswoman sue martin said 
clifton lenoir 37 a new orleans truck driver stranded in 
dallas said he was down to his last 85 cents but he wasnt angry 
at the drivers 
they just want better working conditions and benefits i dont 
blame them lenoir said 
other passengers were less sympathetic 
its getting to the point where were ready to go out there 
and fire one of the buses up run over the strikers and say see 
ya said frank rzepski of philadelphia waiting in indianapolis 
i was supposed to be in portland early friday afternoon for 
a job interview said margaret huffstadler of eugene ore as 
she waited in a bus depot i guess i can kiss that one goodbye 
pickets outside the terminal in columbus ohio met buses 
crossing picket lines at the entrance and tried to stop drivers to 
ask them not to cross their lines but the drivers inched their 
buses forward nudging strikers 
we certainly are intending for this to be a peaceful strike 
union spokesman jerry nelson said we do not condone violence 
during the strike nor destruction of property we urge both sides 
to show restraint 
a 47day greyhound drivers strike in 1983 included several 
violent incidents 
the drivers union said in its final proposal thursday that it 
would agree to wage increases limited to 17 million or 5 percent 
in the first year of a new contract with 15 million in both of 
the final two years 
the company was offering 141 million 21 million and 277 
million over the three years but with some increases contingent on 
increased ridership safety records and productivity factors the 
union refuses to accept the contingencies 
greyhound drivers who according to the company earned an 
average of 24743 last year took a 22 percent pay cut three years 
ago in negotiations prior to a leveraged buyout of the company

economic hard times gripping third world 
countries have created dire conditions for women and impeded 
efforts to wipe out sex discrimination and exploitation un 
experts and activists say 
there has been some progress worldwide in life expectancy for 
women declines in infant mortality and improvements in 
nutrition said vivian lowery derryck president of the 
africanamerican institute in new york 
but when you get to the equality issues the picture is 
starkly gloomy she said 
deteriorating economic conditions have forced women to turn to 
begging prostitution and other quasilegal and illicit 
activities in india peru and several african nations according 
to a unicef study 
the observance of international womens day on thursday and 
related activities worldwide will focus more attention on work to 
promote equal rights for men and women 
the un commission on the status of women meeting this week in 
geneva has concentrated on political and economic obstacles facing 
women with a special interest in areas affected by armed conflicts 
or foreign intervention 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in a special 
address to mark international womens day plans to call for a 
renewed global commitment to improve conditions for women 
both men and women must work together as equal partners in 
order to ensure a sustainable future for the generation to come 
the un chief says in a prepared statement 
recent un reports stress there is much more work to do 
poor women have become poorer more women are poor and women 
are now poorer in relation to men one un report says 
through their hard work they try to ensure the survival of the 
poorest segments of the population but at great cost to themselves 
this drain on womens time resources and energy also inhibits 
their ability to participate in political life and hence in having 
an influence in changing the policies which affect them so 
adversely the report adds 
economic problems also have diminished opportunities for young 
women particularly in latin america and africa 
the crisis has diminished educational and economic 
opportunities for young women thus affecting their future ability 
to contribute to society on an equal basis with men the un 
report said 
a unicefsponsored study on mexico found that the economic 
crisis had worsened conditions for women particularly in rural 
areas because families could no longer survive intact in the 
countryside young women were forced to migrate to find work 
the report by unicef said women were pulled off the land to work 
as day laborers where they had no social benefits lived in sheds 
and were easy targets for sexual abuse and for those women left on 
the farms there was more work to do the report said 
another unicef study concluded that at least onethird of the 
population with the lowest incomes in latin america and the 
caribbean has been kept afloat by poor women working harder and 
longer hours 
unicef research has found that brazilian mothers because of 
their increased responsibilities in coping with the financial 
crisis of the 1980s are experiencing greater mental health 
problems those women feel doubly guilty for the plight of 
their families the unicef study says 
activists point out there are significant signs of progress 
in eastern europe south africa and central america you can 
see that its the all boats rising with the tide phenomenon ms 
lowery derryck said women can see change and it empowers them 
now we need to capitalize on these changes

a judge ruled that hundreds of 
chemicals found in cosmetics foods and drugs must meet the 
standards of a law enacted by california voters that requires 
warning labels on toxic products 
judge ronald robie said friday that gov george deukmejians 
scientific advisory panel which drew up the list of compounds that 
must bear the labels under proposition 65 had incorrectly exempted 
numerous products from the 1986 initiative 
robies decision finalized a tentative ruling he issued last 
fall in a lawsuit brought by environmentalists and labor groups who 
argued that deukmejian was seeking to sidestep the regulations 
approved by voters 
robie said the state had created an improper exemption for 
selected industries without specific regard to the chemicals 
involved 
if upheld on appeal his ruling could force food drug and 
cosmetic companies to evaluate thousands of products to determine 
if they pose a significant chemical risk if that determination is 
made proposition 65 requires that those items carry a warning 
label 
companies will have to spend millions analyzing their products 
to show that they pose no significant risk said peter hutt a 
washington lawyer representing the grocery manufacturers of america 
steven berzon an attorney representing the coalition that 
challenged the deukmejian administration said robies ruling 
goes 100 percent in our favor 
proposition 65 the socalled clean water initiative requires 
warning labels on substances that pose a significant risk for 
cancer and birth defects 
the standards established by proposition 65 are stricter than 
those set by the us food and drug administration and in 
interpreting the initiative state officials initially said fda 
standards could be used for at least 20000 consumer products 
grocery industry representatives had argued that significant 
risk was a vague term and said that removing the exemption would 
prompt unnecessary warnings and undermine consumer confidence 
robie flatly rejected that argument 
defendants interpretation that the initiative accepted 
business as usual in regulatory terms as to these important 
industries is not correct he wrote 
gene linvingston a lawyer in sacramento for the cosmetic 
toiletry and fragrance association said many companies will put 
warning labels on their products even if they pose no risk in order 
to avoid being taken to court

among the perils threatening the 70 
racers and dog teams who mush today in the 18th annual iditarod 
trail sled dog race are hungercrazed moose and ash from the 
redoubt volcano 
not to mention the weather 
temperatures hit the 40s and turned snow into slush on the 
streets of downtown anchorage where the race begins but 
conditions are some of the harshest in the history of the race 
along the 1100mile trail to nome on the bering sea 
awful weather said race manager jack niggemyer its 
probably snowed 40 inches in the last two days 
the heavy snow has kept moose from grazing setting the stage 
for violent encounters between the huge animals and sled dog teams 
on the remote trail and prudent mushers are packing rifles 
redoubt has been erupting intermittently since december spewing 
ash as far north as the area around anchorage 
the race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days the record time set 
by susan butcher of manley in 1987 was 11 days two hours and five 
minutes butcher also won in 1986 and 1988 
since libby riddles became the first woman to win in 1985 women 
have won the race four of the last five years inspiring a popular 
tshirt saying alaska where men are men and women win the 
iditarod 
some participants and race observers said they expect the pace 
to be slowed this year because of the deep snow and poorlypacked 
trail 
we might run out of trail said lavon barve a musher from 
wasilla who finished fifth last year its up to the mushers to 
snowshoe or whatever 
the iditarod was begun in 1973 to commemorate the emergency 
delivery of diphtheria serum to nome by mail carriers driving dog 
teams in 1925 
taken overland after bad weather grounded airplanes the serum 
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote town 
from downtown anchorage the course goes northwest across the 
alaska range and over the tundra before dropping down along the 
yukon river to the bering sea 
mushers must lay over for 24 hours of rest at some point along 
the trail 
the mystique of the iditarod has grown steadily with mushers 
this year arriving from france and switzerland companies spend 
tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor top competitors 
rick swenson of two rivers the only person to win the iditarod 
four times will be trying for a fifth win 
last years winner joe runyan of nenana expects the teams to 
start out slow because of bad weather 
the big strategy this year in terms of snow is to reduce 
injury runyan said 
but the teams cant afford to be too slow he said 
even if youre conservative its better to be in the front of 
the pack

called the ceasefire and threatened to excommunicate geagea aoun 
and their followers if they maintained the fight 
aoun and geagea are maronites the christian community which has 
dominated politics in lebanon since independence from france in 
1943 
civilians used the relative lull today to flee the embattled 
christian enclave for safety in north lebanon the eastern bekaa 
valley and the southern provinces 
the police spokesman said long lines of cars loaded with 
mattresses clothes and furniture were seen heading out of the 
enclave early today 
the spokesman said about 200000 people of the christian 
enclaves 1 million population have fled since jan 30 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said the ceasefire came after a 36hour battle that left more than 
70 dead and resulted in a standstill 
aoun wants geageas 6000strong militia subsumed into his force 
of 19000 mostly christian army troops 
geagea has repeatedly declared his rejection of the generals 
demand and vowed to confront it to the end 
the prestigious newspaper annahar said the ceasefire the 
latest in a series of unsuccessful attempts to stop the fighting 
reflected the balance of horror between both sides 
aoun had tried to penetrate the lebanese forces defenses and 
advance between nabaa and sin elfil to the seaside boulevard to 
prepare for an advance by his tanks to the militias headquarters 
and adjacent beirut port a key militia supply line 
aoun has rejected parliaments election last fall of president 
elias hrawi who has pledged to enact a peace pact aoun says he 
opposes the peace plan because it does not require the pullout of 
40000 syrian troops deployed under a 1976 arab league mandate to 
keep the peace in the civil war 
hrawi fired aoun as army commander but aoun refused to step 
down

a group that defends the legend of billy 
the kid says a computer photo analysis indicates a texan nicknamed 
brushy bill who died in 1950 probably wasnt the famed outlaw 
as he had claimed 
the computer tests compared a photograph of ollie l brushy 
bill roberts who died in hico texas a week short of his 90th 
birthday in december 1950 and a tintype of william bonney who 
died at age 21 on july 14 1881 
most people including a coroners inquest jury at the time say 
bonney was billy the kid and he was shot to death in fort sumter 
nm by lincoln sheriff pat garrett 
but hico has its share of brushy bill believers who maintain the 
kid escaped perhaps with official help to survive to a ripe old 
age in texas 
billy the kid was one of the primary players in the bloody 
lincoln county war of the late 19th century now the lincoln 
county heritage trust is watching out for the kids legend and it 
initiated the photo project 
trust director robert l hart said friday the computer tests 
were based on a similarity index of 25 landmarks on the faces 
the computer also matched billy to a database of 150 people from 
both sexes and many racial groups hart said to show how many 
people in the sample if any were closer in appearance to billy 
than was brushy bill 
from the 25 landmarks of the face the computer mathematically 
derives a single number the index of similarity 
if brushy bill and billy the kid were the same man hart said 
then in the comparison billy is no 1 and brushy should come out 
no 2 
when the comparison was run brushy bill was no 42 
that means there were 40 other individuals who look more like 
billy the kid than brushy does in short brushy doesnt look very 
much like billy the kid at all hart said 
hico justice of the peace bobby hefner a brushy bill buff said 
friday the computer study means nothing 
i dont accept the tintype as being billy the kid at all 
hefner said in a telephone interview from his hico home on the 
other hand i dont accept the study you let me program my 
computer and i guarantee brushy billd be number one 
but clyde snow an oklahoma forensic anthropologist known for 
his work on the remains of nazi war criminal josef mengele said 
the computer looks at photographs in a less subjective way than 
people do 
as far as brushy bill roberts is concerned the weight of the 
evidence is to the point that if there were a court case wed be 
willing to go in and say beyond a reasonable doubt the two 
photographs are not photographs of the same individual snow said 
hart said the brushy bill comparison is the only one that has 
been done but the project plans to look at a dozen or so other 
photographs including pictures of two other claimants john miller 
of ramah nm and walking henry smith and photographs believed 
to be those of billy taken at other times 
that could take a couple of years 
hart called the project a marriage of history and technology 
historians dont seem to be able to solve the problem of 
whether brushy bill and billy the kid are the same person and 
bringing in science was another way to answer the question he said 
the photographs one from a las vegas nm collection and the 
other owned by a san francisco family came to light after the 
project began last year 
hefner 54 agreed research would continue into the legend of 
billy the kid 
the old texas rangers had a saying that no one can stand up to 
a man thats in the right and keeps on acomin and thats my 
approach to this hefner said im in the right ive enough 
evidence in hand to convince anyone that doesnt have a prejudice 
i never met old brushy he said maybe its my sense of 
fair play of being justice of the peace i want justice done for a 
local man id like to see it on through to a just conclusion

complaints from the widow of famed football 
coach vince lombardi helped prompt the arrests of hundreds of 
homosexual men at a turnpike service area named after him a state 
police spokesman says 
marie lombardi complained to a detective more than 10 years ago 
about the reputation of the new jersey turnpikes vince lombardi 
service area as a hangout for gay men capt thomas gallagher said 
friday 
mrs lombardi who died in 1982 told the detective she was 
disturbed by the service areas reputation and threatened to have 
lombardis name and football memorabilia removed the state police 
spokesman said 
the detective whom gallagher would not identify said that 
there had been many such complaints about the rest station in 
northern new jersey and that mrs lombardi complained that it was 
getting all this media attention 
in response to the protests thensuperintendent clinton pagano 
launched an undercover operation that led to hundreds of arrests 
between 1986 and last month 
officers working on overtime lingered in the mens room in teams 
of two encouraged men to join them in homosexual activity and then 
arrested takers on charges of lewd conduct 
the operation was halted last week by col justin dintino whom 
gov jim florio named to replace pagano dintino called the 
undercover operation repulsive 
no matter who started it what let it continue was police 
believing they could get away with this kind of behavior said 
evan wolfson staff attorney for lambda legal defense fund a new 
yorkbased civil rights group that pressured new jersey officials 
to halt the crackdown 
that group and other critics have labeled the operation 
entrapment inspired by bigotry against a sexual minority 
state police should not be preying on vulnerable minorities 
let alone wasting valuable resources on such an absurd operation 
wolfson said 
pagano the superintendent for 14 years was moved to the 
lessprestigious job of director of the state division of motor 
vehicles 
the exact number of arrests ensuing from the service area 
crackdown is unknown gallagher said 
the legal defense group has counted 540 arrests between february 
1988 and october 1989 which covers only a portion of the period in 
which the operation was underway 
jean adubato a turnpike spokeswoman said she was not aware of 
any complaints by the wife of the former green bay packer coach 
who coached high school football in englewood before joining the 
professional ranks 
we do not comment on what the state police do its strictly 
in their hands the spokeswoman said

prosecutors prepared the final salvo in 
their case against joseph hazelwood as the defense team geared up 
to begin calling witnesses in the criminal trial of the exxon 
valdez skipper 
hazelwood came down with the flu friday causing cancellation of 
the days court session and giving attorneys time for paperwork and 
witness interviews 
assistant district attorney brent cole who has presented four 
weeks of testimony said he had three more experts waiting to 
testify monday before he rests his case 
superior court judge karl johnstone told hazelwoods lawyers to 
be prepared to start calling witnesses on tuesday the judge also 
suggested that lawyers begin work on proposed jury instructions 
both sides will submit legal instructions and the judge will choose 
which ones to give jurors when they begin deliberations 
johnstone told jurors the trial could be over in two to three 
weeks 
meanwhile the prosecution filed papers asking the judge to 
admit evidence on whether hazelwoods ship was in danger of sinking 
after it ran aground on bligh reef setting off the nations worst 
oil spill 
they urged rejection of the tanker skippers claim that evidence 
about his ships potential sinking is irrelevant 
hazelwoods lawyers contend it was impossible for the skipper to 
move his giant tanker off the reef once it was stuck there and 
thus it makes no difference whether he tried to move it they seek 
to bar evidence on what might have happened if the ship moved 
the state seeks to bolster the speculation of expert witnesses 
on the subject by showing jurors the results of accident 
simulations suggesting the tanker was in danger of capsizing or 
sinking 
the 43yearold hazelwood from huntington ny is charged 
with criminal mischief reckless endangerment operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil he could receive 
7 years in prison and fines of 61000 
the exxon valdez ran aground on bligh reef on march 24 spilling 
11 million gallons of crude oil into prince william sound the 
spill killed countless birds fish and other marine animals and 
blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline 
a key element in the charges against hazelwood is recklessness 
and assistant district attoney brent cole is seeking to prove that 
the skippers alleged efforts to try moving the ship constituted 
recklessness 
according to a legal definition he has read to jurors a 
person acts recklessly when the person is aware of and 
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk 
it continues the risk must be of such a nature and degree that 
disregard of it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of 
conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation 
to be found guilty of second degree criminal mischief the 
felony the jury must determine that hazelwood recklessly risked 
the property of another in an amount exceeding 100000 thus the 
prosecution must prove recklessness and risk 
captain hazelwood is arguing that because it was impossible 
for the exxon valdez to come free there was no risk involved 
said the prosecutions legal memorandum but it added the issue 
is not whether it was possible for the vessel to come free but 
whether captain hazelwoods mistakes in not realizing the vessel 
was firmly aground and not recognizing the danger in refloating 
were reasonable

argentinas biggest teachers 
union said it will strike monday on the first day of classes to 
demand higher wages in this inflationwracked nation 
also friday interest rates for interbank lending rose to record 
levels 28 percent a day ahead of the governments scheduled 
announcement of a new plan to try to rescue the economy analysts 
said the increase reflected concern about the new government 
measures to be announced sunday 
few details have emerged about the plan but president carlos 
menem said this week that it will include increaseing telephone 
rates by 300 percent an official at the economy ministry raul 
cuello said it would be a hyperstabilizing shock 
the announcement by the 650000member confederation of 
education workers followed wage strikes that shut down the federal 
court system for two days this week and virtually all operations of 
the national airline aerolineas argentinas on thursday 
college professors pressing similar wage demands have refused to 
work for more than a week delaying the taking and grading of 
entrance examinations 
bus and train drivers doctors at municipal hospitals state 
bank clerks municipal employees and other have staged strikes in 
past weeks to demand higher wages or protest government plans to 
sell public companies and cut the fiscal budget 
the teachers union says it will keep up its strike if 
government does not grant a basic wage of 66 a month twice the 
present basic salary 
grammar schools are scheduled to resume monday following a break 
for the southern hemispheres summer season high schools and 
colleges begin classes a week later 
in 1988 a strike delayed the start of classes for more than two 
months 
menem has been beset by inflation currency and labor woes since 
taking office in july 
the cost of living soared by 79 percent in january and it was 
projected at about that level for february 
reflecting higher interest rates banks borrowing australs the 
national currency from other banks on friday were paying 28 
percent a day according to the private news agency diarios y 
noticias that broke the record of 17 percent set wednesday the 
news agency called the new rate a world record 
interest rates have gone up steadily the past two months as the 
austral has fallen against the dollar and banks have raised rates 
to keep deposits 
at the close of the business day friday the austral traded at 
5450 per dollar it was 6551 when menem took office eight months 
ago when it was introduced in 1985 each austral was worth 120 
the devaluations are linked with excessive money expansion by 
the central bank and doubts about the governments economic program 
menem has raised public service rates drastically during his 
eight months in office he said four decades of economic decline 
can only be reversed by opening up the statedominated economy by 
selling public companies deregulating monopolies lowering tariff 
barriers raising taxes and cutting subsidies 
newspapers in buenos aires speculated the government on sunday 
might announce controls on foreign exchange and restrictions on 
wages and prices 
export taxes might also be raised public workers fired and 
utility rates increased a fourth time since menem took office the 
newspaper la nacion said

world demand for commercial jetliners will keep 
soaring into the next century partly because of new markets for 
western planes in eastern europe the boeing co forecast 
boeing officials friday increased their estimate of demand for 
planes to the year 2005 by 27 percent citing growth in the world 
economy disposable income and far east air travel 
for the first time the worlds largest commercial airplane 
manufacturer also included eastern europe in the projections 
predicting that warsaw pact nations would start purchasing planes 
from western manufacturers 
the soviet union was excluded from the forecast 
the greatest growth is anticipated from carriers with routes 
within asia and between the far east and europe or the united 
states and the average planes capacity also will increase 
according to the boeing commercial airplane groups annual market 
outlook 
we believe that as the worlds economies grow and as there is 
more disposable income that will mean an increase in demand 
said john hayhurst vice president of marketing for boeing 
commercial 
the increase also reflects the 95 billion in orders placed with 
airplane makers last year more than boeing had expected hayhurst 
said 
the company also forecast no major oil price shocks over the 
next 16 years 
the companys projections pegged jet airplane orders from 1990 
to 2005 at 9935 planes worth 626 billion 2097 planes and 136 
billion more than in the 16year forecast issued last year 
the projections are for all manufacturers but boeing expects to 
maintain its 54 percent to 55 percent market share hayhurst said 
hayhurst said the company hopes to launch the new midsize 777 
a 767 derivative in the first half of this year designers are 
looking seriously into whether it will have folding wings to 
reduce airport crowding he said

exxon corp moved to shore up its 
credibility after two oil spills in two days by announcing an 
immediate suspension of tanker and barge operations at a major east 
coast coast refinery and distribution center 
lee raymond president of the new yorkbased oil giant 
announced friday evening that marine operations in new jersey 
where the company operates its only east coast refinery would be 
halted pending an evaluation of procedures 
we deeply regret the recent accidents at our new jersey 
facilities and the impacts and concerns they have caused raymond 
said in a statement 
we are seriously committed to conducting our operations in a 
safe and environmentally responsible manner and we are taking this 
measure to demonstrate that commitment 
exxon said the huge refinery in linden would essentially be 
idled by the move but the company said alternate supply 
arrangements are being made 
exxon anticipates that gasoline heating oil propane and 
other products will continue to be made available to customers on 
an uninterrupted basis the statement said 
exxon spokesman barry wood said deliveries by truck of oil 
already in the companys storage tanks would not be affected 
the bayway refinery in linden and the bayonne distribution 
center the third largest of five such exxon facilities in the 
united states have been the site of three oil spills since jan 1 
the spills have been a major setback in exxon efforts to 
rehabilitate its image since last years 11milliongallon spill 
the nations worst in alaskas prince william sound 
it was pretty clear that exxon had lost the confidence of the 
public said rep robert torricelli dnj 
torricelli had written friday requesting that the company make 
voluntary reforms its a bit better and faster response than i 
would have expected 
the companys local troubles began jan 1 when an underwater 
pipeline sprang a leak and spilled 567000 gallons of heating oil 
into the arthur kill waterway separating new jersey from the staten 
island borough of new york city

expected in northern jammukashir state the sources said on 
condition of anonymity 
in neighboring pakistan a leader in the pakistaniheld section 
of kashmir today said pakistani kashmiris will march to the border 
next friday in protest and invade jammukashmir in a matter of 
weeks 
sultan mahmood president of azad moslem conference made his 
comments at a news conference in islamabad the pakistani capital 
at least 49 people were fatally shot thursday by army and 
paramilitary troops as an estimated 1 million moslem demonstrators 
converged on srinagar to press demands for independence from 
predominantly hindu india police said 
todays shooting raised the death toll to at least 163 in 
kashmir since the latest round of secessionist violence flared jan 
20 
in washington the state department said friday it had appealed 
to the indian government to prevent the use of excessive force 
against the proindependence demonstrators 
we deplore the loss of life in kashmir we are disturbed at 
the rising number of casualties state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said in washington 
an indian government spokesman speaking on the customary 
condition of anonymity said troops opened fire thursday in 
selfdefense witnesses also speaking on condition of anonymity 
said some of the marchers tried to seize weapons from the 
government security forces 
on jan 20 the government launched a crackdown on escalating 
protests bombings and attacks on government intelligence agents 
and other officials 
after the crackdown started army and paramilitary troops were 
beefed up in srinagar and surrounding towns in the kashmir valley 
next to the pakistani frontier 
some of the paramilitary central reserve police force and border 
security guards were withdrawn during legislative elections tuesday 
in eight other indian states these troops were returning now the 
airport and police sources said 
each plane landing at srinagar airport carried about 100 men

imposition of the curfew processions ranging from about 20000 to 
1 million demonstrators had converged on the office of the un 
military observer group that has been assigned to the 
indianpakistani frontier for the past 40 years because of the two 
nations dispute over kashmir 
pakistan an overwhelmingly moslem nation claimed kashmir and 
twice went to war with india over the question of the predominantly 
moslem valleys sovereignty 
the kashmir valley is governed by india as part of jammukashmir 
state the only indian state with a moslem majority the western 
slice of kashmir is under pakistani control both countries claim 
all of kashmir 
initially kashmiri separatists on the indian side of the 
disputed frontier had pressed for union with pakistan but in the 
past year their call for secession has been coupled with demands 
for kashmirs independence as a buffer nation between india the 
regions military and political giant and its longtime adversary 
pakistan the two nations were once ruled as one unit by colonial 
britain but upon independence in 1947 they were partitioned along 
religious lines 
the kashmir section of indias jammukashmir state is mostly 
moslem while the southern jammu region is mostly hindu overall 
moslems make up 64 percent of the states 6 million people 
but nationwide moslems form only 12 percent of indias 880 
million people of whom 82 percent are hindus

nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
said today he favored calling a special meeting of foreign 
ministers of the western alliance to discuss german unification and 
arms control 
smaller nations in the north atlantic treaty organization have 
complained about being left out of discussions among the four nato 
powers on uniting germany and suggested an emergency conference 
i personally favor the idea woerner said at nato 
headquarters after meeting with foreign minister jiri dienstbier of 
czechoslovakia 
we could have very useful discussions on conventional arms 
negotiations and we could have discussions and an exchange of 
views about the process of german unification 
woerner said no final decision has been made or date set for a 
special meeting but a nato official demanding anonymity said 
dates in april have been discussed 
the decision by france britain the united states and the 
soviet union to meet separately to discuss german unity has angered 
some allies including italy belgium and the netherlands 
under the twoplusfour process set up by the four 
victorious world war ii powers the two german states also will 
meet after march 18 elections in east germany to discuss their 
future 
west german chancellor helmut kohl will travel to nato on 
thursday to talk to ambassadors of the 16 alliance nations about 
german unification 
woerner said kohls visit showed the the importance he 
attributes to consulting with all allies so i think all those 
who are thinking that this process will only be restricted to the 
twoplusfour structure are wrong

us and south korean military 
engineers cut through nine feet of granite today to unearth a 
tunnel allegedly dug by north korea under the demilitarized zone 
separating the two koreas 
the tunnel was discovered in a remote mountainous border area 
called punchbowl the site of a fierce battle between us and 
communist troops during the 195053 korean war 
breaking through shouted onlookers as engineers with giant 
drills and earthmoving equipment succeeded in reaching the tunnel 
in seoul defense minister lee sanghoon told a news conference 
the tunnel located about 100 miles northeast of the capital is 
a southward tunnel that can be used forinvasion 
the tunnel is the fourth to be found since 1974 
but lee said his ministry believed there were more than 20 being 
dug by north korea inside the 25milewide 155milelong dmz one 
of the most heavily armed borders in the world 
south korean officials claim north korean leader kim il sung 
ordered the tunnels built to infiltrate communist troops behind 
south koreas first defense lines north korea has denied digging 
any tunnels 
a statement issued by the usled united nations command said 
the tunnel was apparently dug by north korea to invade the 
south 
it said the tunnel was six feet high and six feet wide large 
enough for three armed soldiers to run through it side by side a 
full regiment could pass through the tunnel in an hour officials 
said 
the manmade tunnel is 430 feet beneath the surface the defense 
minister said he said its length and age were not yet known 
in view of the changing global situation and our sincere peace 
initiatives the construction of such a tunnel into our area across 
the truce line is a serious violation of the armistice agreement 
and an intolerable act of aggression lee said 
he urged north korea to stop provocative acts of aggression 
and help pursue ways to cut tensions on the divided korean 
peninsula 
col ht linke spokesman for the united nations command said 
the tunnel was first detected after a us army investigation team 
drilled into a tunnellike cavity on christmas eve 
closer observation confirmed the probability that a tunnel 
existed and work to confirm suspicions began dec 30 1989 linke 
said this also confirmed our belief that north korea has 
constructed other tunnels across the frontline linke said 
south korea found three tunnels allegedly dug by north korea 
across the border in 1974 1975 and 1978 two of them were 
discovered near the truce village of panmunjom 35 miles north of 
seoul 
a third tunnel found in 1978 near panmunjom was dug through 
granite nearly 500 feet below the surface and extends 1300 feet 
into south korean territory across the border it has been open to 
the public 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
the capitalist south in 1945 after world war ii north korea 
invaded south korea in 1950 to start the threeyear korean war the 
two countries remain technically at war despite sporadic dialogue 
they remain arch enemies no unauthorized travel or communication 
is allowed between citizens of the two sides

marchers assembled to commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of voting rights march to montgomery kicked off the 
weekend with a parade for a new cause 
the 300 marchers focused their protest friday on the dismissal 
of selmas first black school superintendent by the six whites on 
the 11member school board 
what is happening in selma threatens education across the 
nation said the rev ben chavis jr executive director of the 
commission for racial justice of the united church of christ in 
cleveland ohio 
the weekends activities include a reenactment sunday of the 
1965 march to alabamas capital that helped prompt congress to pass 
the voting rights act the law allowed blacks across the south to 
register to vote free of intimidation or rules designed to block 
them from the ballot box 
the focus of fridays march however was the school boards 
decision not to renew superintendent norward roussells contract 
when it expires in june protesters contend he is being fired in 
part because he dismantled a tracking system that tended to 
create segregated classrooms with blacks placed on slower tracks 
in the 6000student system which is 70 percent black 
the marchers gathered outside selma high school when classes let 
out friday when the crowd reached the edmund pettus bridge scene 
of a confrontation in 1965 marchers knelt in prayer 
later the marchers stopped outside the selma school board 
building where roussell was cheered when he said selma has a 
message for the rest of the country and the world and that message 
is we will not allow our children to enter the 21st century 
undereducated or miseducated 
the school board cited an evalution critical of roussells 
managerial skills for dismissing him he contends the evaluation is 
unsubstantiated

the six members of an international expedition 
arrived today at a soviet base on antarcticas eastern coast 
completing what organizers called the longest unmechanized crossing 
of the forbidding continent 
im feeling great happiness and great relief at the end of 
seven difficult months coleader jeanlouis etienne of france 
said in a live interview on french television moments after the 
arrival just after 1 pm paris time 7 am est 
in a hookup with reporters in paris etienne said he was looking 
forward to returning to normal life he said that apart from his 
companions and the dogs that pulled the sleds he saw only three 
animals all birds 
i want to see nature i want to see living things etienne 
said 
the arrival ended a sevenmonth 3800mile trek by ski and 
dogsled that risked turning to tragedy at the very close 
keizo funatsu of japan disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours 
before being found by his worried fellow adventurers friday morning 
on feb 12 italian mountaineer reinhold messner and west german 
adventurer arved fuchs completed what they said was a 1699mile 
crossing of antarctica on foot without the use of sled dogs they 
are expected to arrive in frankfurt later this month to provide 
details of their journey 
the television images showed the final steps of the latest 
expedition live the men in their bright red and blue suits stood 
out against the white snow as they and their 30 dogs reached a sign 
marked finish in english by the gray waters of the indian ocean 
six national flags flapped in the wind representing the 
countries of the participants besides funatsu and etienne the 
team members were coleader will steger of ely minn victor 
boyarsky of the soviet union geoff somers of britain and quin dahe 
from china 
the expedition was intended to generate support for antarcticas 
preservation and to demonstrate the power of international 
cooperation 
to attract attention the team decided to attempt the first 
unmechanized crossing using only dogsleds to help them transport 
their supplies and equipment 
on dec 11 the team reached their halfway point becoming the 
first to reach the south pole by dogsled since roald amundsen 
discovered the pole in 1911 
the journey began july 28 near the tip of the antarctic 
peninsula which reaches out toward south america and ended at the 
soviet science station on the indian ocean at mirnyy but etienne 
said in a television interview that the toughest part came earlier 
the first two months were very very hard he said we 
started to doubt after a month whether we would make it 
he described antarctica as huge and sometimes monstrous 
president bush sent a letter of contratulations to the team and 
invited members to the white house 
your spirit of international friendship and cooperation not 
only helped make this fantastic journey possible but also set a 
wonderful example for the world community of nations bush said 
french president francois mitterrand sent a message of 
congratulations to etienne calling the trek a human adventure 
and a scientific testimony of the importance of the antarctic 
continent for our environment 
mitterrand said he was looking forward to welcoming the six team 
members in paris on march 21 
it had been feared that deteriorating weather would keep the 
adventurers on the continent for as long as a month and jeopardize 
an elaborate international tour to tout the expedition later this 
month 
but winds that reached 73 mph pushed the harbor ice apart 
leaving a path for the professor zubov a ship that is to take them 
to new zealand soviet antarctic officials in leningrad told cathy 
demoll the expeditions manager in paris that unless conditions 
change loading of the ship will begin monday 
theyre talking about using lifeboats to carry everyone to the 
ship demoll said the trouble is we dont know how dangerous 
that will be we just dont know whats going to happen were 
completely at the mercy of the weather 
the wind was howling at 70 mph and the temperature was 20 below 
zero when funatsu left a soviet mobile home where he was meeting 
with a french film crew thursday spokeswoman jennifer gasperini 
said from st paul minn 
when funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner team 
members tied themselves together and made a search of the area 
until 10 pm when they gave up because of darkness gasperini 
said the search resumed at 4 am friday and funatsu was found 
about two hours later she said 
etienne said that when expedition members came by calling 
keizo keizo keizo funatsu jumped out like a mushroom from 
the snow he was in very good shape 
he had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling 
inside just as the dogs do each night to stay warm said 
gasperini who received the news from support staff 
team members were quite shook up by what happened gasperini 
said explaining that in such blizzards its easy to lose all sense 
of orientation even in a small area 
its an extremely frightening situation she said

maryland gov william donald schaefer is 
beginning to think his proposal to annex the district of columbia 
wasnt such a good idea after all 
a week ago schaefer proposed joining the nations capital with 
the free state an idea that drew both laughs and sharp criticism 
from dc statehood advocates and elected officials in maryland and 
virginia 
within several days schaefer was saying im not going to 
push this 
we have enough problems in maryland dealing with one major 
urban center and thats baltimore said thomas v miller a 
democrat who heads marylands senate we certainly cant take on 
washington dc with its attendant problems 
from virginia which absorbed a chunk of the district back in 
1846 came smiles and skepticism 
it amuses me to see the governor of maryland say they can take 
care of the district better than it can take care of itself said 
virginia state del leslie l byrne of suburban falls church i 
think he was talking off the top of his head 
i cant see why maryland would want it said another 
virginia legislator sen robert l calhoun ralexandria 
such has been the reaction since schaefer said last sunday that 
he would entertain the notion of having the nations capital 
absorbed by maryland 
schaefers remarks caught many people by surprise especially in 
view of the negative headlines washington has attracted lately 
the mayor of washington marion barry has been indicted on 
cocaine and perjury charges and poor neighborhoods of the city are 
awash in drugrelated murders a broad range of allegations 
involving barry is continuing according to us attorney jay b 
stephens 
meanwhile district officials are struggling to control growing 
budget deficits while city prisons operate under court orders to 
control overcrowding 
some of schaefers critics including the rev jesse l jackson 
accused him of racism 
really what hes proposing is a kind of bantustan concept 
said jackson the term refers to south africas policy of separate 
communities for blacks as we end bantustans in south africa we 
do not want to transfer them to washington the issue here is 
sovereignty selfrespect 
marylands flamboyant governor was quick to defend himself 
schaefer said financial gains that would come from annexing a city 
that with a population of nearly 700000 has more taxpayers than 
five states 
it was a good intention now its being interpreted as racism 
and all the rest thats not true schaefer said 
jackson who has taken up the cause of dc statehood says full 
voting rights for the nations capital is the only acceptable plan 
the people of washington want selfdetermination said frank 
watkins a top aide to jackson he said the idea of annexation is 
offensive to the people of the district of columbia and maryland 
the house did pass a proposed constitutional amendment in 1978 
to allow dc statehood but the measure expired after being 
ratified by just 16 of the required 37 states

atlantis will end its secret 
military mission by landing at edwards air force base calif at 
108 pm sunday nasa said today in an announcement that briefly 
broke a news blackout on the flight 
the crew is doing well and beginning landing preparations and 
the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily the space agency 
said in the terse announcement 
the anouncement made no assessment of weather conditions for the 
sunday landing forecasts call for a pacific ocean storm to move 
into the landing site area in southern california 
nasa sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
fivemember allmilitary crew of atlantis on thursday released 
into orbit a 500 million spy satellite 
the satellite is designed to take detailed pictures of the 
soviet union including areas never before viewed by 
shuttlelaunched satellites sources said it also is able to tune 
into electronic communications worldwide 
we can safely assume there are no problems as long as 
mission control does not interrupt the silence said bruce 
buckingham a spokesman for the space agency 
nasa has not released details of astronaut activities aboard 
atlantis which was launched wednesday because the shuttle is on a 
classified department of defense mission 
but jeff carr a spokesman at the johnson space center in 
houston said that if the astronauts follow shuttle mission 
routine friday was the final full day to complete the secret 
objectives 
astronauts generally clean up and start dismantling and stowing 
equipment the day before landing carr said 
they also must test the reaction control jets and check other 
critical systems that atlantis will need as it plunges through 
earths atmosphere 
a general inspection of the solid rocket boosters has not 
revealed any abnormalities said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone but 
we really wont know until theyre taken apart she said 
the boosters were recovered from the atlantic ocean where they 
fell after liftoff early wednesday morning nasas sixth attempt to 
launch the spaceship in less than a week the boosters will be 
disassembled and refurbished for later use 
the 1986 challenger disaster was caused by a failed solid rocket 
booster 
atlantis flight is 34th shuttle mission and the sixth dedicated 
solely to the military

a small black axe hangs just inside the door to 
veniamin gaufbergs apartment reinforcement strips glisten in the 
doors frame 
the gaunt 69yearold jew who fought the nazis in world war ii 
is preparing for a new battle against racial attacks 
if they open the door ill cut off their fingers what else 
can i do asked gaufberg 
although not all have resorted to axes gaufberg is typical of 
soviet jews anguished by what they say is a resurgence of 
antisemitism dating back centuries like record numbers of his 
countrymen gaufberg has had enough and is planning to leave his 
homeland for good something he vowed he would never do 
i have one goal now to survive until the day i leave he 
said in the western moscow apartment he shares with four relatives 
jewish writers have been beaten antijewish graffiti has 
appeared and hatemongers openly distribute leaflets that borrow 
from hitler to condemn the zionist menace and call for attacks 
on jews 
even the official press has carried blatantly antisemitic 
articles 
alexander bushkov wrote in the newspaper krasnoyarsk komsomolets 
last june that jews in the soviet leadership participated in all 
the cases of genocide against the russian people 
no recent mob violence against the soviet unions 14 million 
jews has been reported but rumors and threats of pogroms or 
organized racial attacks are instilling a strong sense of danger 
even panic 
it has added to a jewish exodus of unprecedented proportions 
aided by easier soviet emigration policies about 71000 soviet 
jews left last year the highest annual total since the 1967 middle 
east war began a new wave of emigration nearly 5000 left in 
january 
everyone i know is planning to run away wherever possible 
said gaufberg 
the situation is so intolerable every day i feel it said 
roza gutman a 23yearold jew from the crimea huddled in a crowd 
of wouldbe emigres at the us embassy in moscow waiting to learn 
whether she and her family would be allowed to enter the united 
states she explained the forces driving them away 
she entered a moscow music teachers college because she felt 
that as a jew she stood little chance of being accepted at the 
more prestigious conservatory but today there is greater danger 
than discrimination 
gutman said she is considering buying a gun to protect herself 
from threats which she said included vandalism to her dormitory 
room and shouts from classmates to clear out of our country 
its become so acute that every sunday my friends say there 
will be a pogrom and dont go out she said 
now its simply dangerous theres an elementary threat to 
life she said 
in december the soviet unions first national jewish congress 
in decades condemned the orgy of antisemitism sweeping the 
country and said it was causing an unprecedented panic among the 
jewish population 
president mikhail s gorbachevs liberalization drive has been a 
mixed blessing for soviet jews it has allowed freer emigration and 
the opportunity to practice their religion and culture without 
official harassment but it has also allowed russian nationalists 
to speak out in some cases with antisemitic messages the 
worsening economy and political upheaval of gorbachevs rule have 
caused many soviets to look for scapegoats and jews have been 
prime targets 
some jews like gutman suspect highlevel complicity in 
antisemitism but can offer little proof the record of the 
countrys previous rulers however is far from clean 
czar nicholas i said in 1816 nine years before ascending the 
throne that jews were fullfledged leeches and his regime 
portrayed jewish traders as exploiters of the masses czarist 
forces either stood by or participated in beatings murders and 
looting of apartments of jews in pogroms of the 1880s and early 
1900s 
after the soviets took power with strong support and 
participation of jews jews no longer were confined to a section of 
russia known as the pale and although it was poorly enforced a 
1918 decree signed by soviet founder vladimir lenin outlawed 
antisemitism 
his successor josef stalin however launched a campaign 
against cosmopolitanism after world war ii in which jews were 
arrested and executed 
the official soviet encyclopedia boasted in 1953 that soviet 
policy led to the disappearance of the jewish question but 
antisemitism continued jews faced discrimination in education 
jobs and the practice of their religion 
the government has been accused to taking a lax attitude toward 
the threats authorities have countered with a propaganda campaign 
of their own 
the regional communist party chief in odessa went on television 
in late january to report that a commission condemned nationalist 
and chauvinist activity in the black sea port which has a large 
jewish population leaflets quoting hitlers mein kampf and 
calling for jewish pogroms had been spread in odessa 
in moscow the interior ministry said rumors of impending 
pogroms are unfounded and that soviet press articles reporting the 
threats mislead the public and can serve to promote ethnic strife 
and destabilization 
the strongest official response has been the filing of criminal 
charges of inciting national and racial hatred and strife 
against pamyat the russian nationalist group linked to the wave of 
antisemitism the weekly newspaper literaturnaya gazeta said the 
charges were filed after pamyat published a statement that said in 
part jews and their relatives must not be allowed to defend 
dissertations to acquire knowledge and get academic titles to 
join the soviet communist party 
about 50 people identified in the official press as pamyat 
members stormed a meeting of a liberal writers group jan 18 in 
moscow and beat participants some of them jews an account in the 
magazine ogonyok said the attackers called them zhids a 
derogatory term for jews and vowed today we came with a 
megaphone the next time it will be with machine guns

lines of cars and pickups piled high with 
mattresses clothes and household goods snaked out of christian 
east beirut on saturday during a ceasefire in the battle for 
control of the christian enclave 
sniper fire crackled despite the ceasefire but there were no 
reports of new casualties 
police said civil defense teams evacuated 12 dead and 26 wounded 
from the battered districts of nabaa and sin elfil during the 
night after the fighting between gen michel aouns troops and the 
lebanese forces militia subsided 
that raised the overall casualty toll since the battles began 
jan30 to at least 766 killed and 2087 wounded 
the ceasefire took effect at 9 pm friday after maronite 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir threatened to excommunicate the fighters 
and their leaders if they did not stop shooting 
both aoun and his rival lebanese forces leader samir geagea 
are maronites the christian sect that has dominated lebanon since 
independence from france in 1943 
sfeir speaking at a peace rally in bkirki north of beirut 
lashed out at the antagonists and declared a christian worships 
god he loves has mercy on and helps his relative he does not 
kill him humiliate him or make him homeless 
the battle for dominance in the 310squaremile christian 
enclave has driven onefifth of the areas 1 million inhabitants 
from their homes to relative safety elsewhere 
a woman carrying a suitcase in one hand and a plastic bag of 
food in the other shepherded three children across beiruts 
dividing green line into the moslem sector theyve made us 
homeless only god is left for us now she wailed 
another woman lugging three suitcases yelled at one of aouns 
soldiers on the christian side of the 3milelong demarcation line 
finish this war 
go tell the patriarch he answered coldly 
christians were also fleeing by ferry for the east mediterranean 
island of cyprus 100 miles to the northwest 
most christians feared the fighting would flare again because 
aoun appears determined to eliminate geageas militia which has 
6000 fighters and thousands of reservists 
aoun has about 19000 soldiers and has demanded geagea disband 
his militia and merge it with aouns army to create a political 
organization geagea refuses 
the ceasefire the latest in a series of truces that have been 
either ignored or broken ended 36 hours of fierce battles around 
the districts of nabaa and sin elfil 
aoun moved against geagea at dawn thursday with his usmade 
m48 tanks and advanced 200 yards to the edge of the districts but 
he was blocked from moving into the narrow alleys of the two 
quarters 
aoun apparently was seeking to oust geageas strongholds to 
reach the wide coastal highway so he could attack the militias 
headquarters in the karantina district and the nearby beirut port 
the strategic 12story shalouhi building that once housed the 
offices of several western companies was in a no mans land it 
changed hands several times thursday and friday in savage 
roomtoroom fighting 
aouns headquarters said in a communique that he withdrew his 
forces as a goodwill gesture so mediators could resume efforts 
to work out a settlement

the appeal came from loudpseakers strung 
across mosques and by word of mouth 100000 people have taken 
shelter in mosques they are hungry we need food 
within minutes moslem housewives collected their pots and pans 
within an hour huge dinners of rice and vegetable curry were ready 
the food was passed from hand to hand across narrow alleys and 
from rooftop to rooftop to avoid indian patrols until it reached 
the mosques that dot this city of nearly 1 million people 
the appeal was for food and it came if the appeal goes for 
giving ones life that will come too said mohammad ramzan a 
74yearold retired government employee 
moslems in the kashmir valley seem ready for a fullscale battle 
for independence the relay of food was thursday the day 
government troops shot and killed at least 49 moslems during 
marches by about a million moslems demanding secession from 
hindudominated india 
it was the largest demonstration for secession ever in the 
kashmir valley a moslemdominated region where residents have 
chafed and periodically broken into violence over indian rule for 
the last four decades 
thursday was the watershed in the indian governments efforts 
to keep the area under indian control said a local moslem 
policeman speaking on condition of anonymity 
look at this he said pointing at his police uniform 
inside this uniform there is a kashmiri first and a policeman 
later i am no more an indian and i will never pick up arms 
against my brother kashmiris 
urged on by militants moslems are starting to reject everything 
that is indian 
billboards with the word india have been vandalized indian 
banks report low business many residents have set back their 
watches half an hour to correspond with the time in neighboring 
and islamic pakistan 
many people have stopped wearing wristwatches fearful of 
offending either the militants or the government 
why take undue risk i just dont wear a wristwatch anymore 
a hotel doorman said 
in the last few days a new directive went out to shopkeepers do 
not accept indian currency instead use the pakistani currency 
that indian sources say the militants are smuggling into kashmir 
yes we have heard about the directive not to accept indian 
currency but i dont think it has been put to practice said an 
employee at one of srinagars top hotels 
indian currency is still legal tender but if the campaign 
goes on the way it is going now the day is not far off when we may 
have to refuse indian money he said asking that neither he nor 
his hotel be identified 
under orders from the main islamic militant group the 
jammukashmir liberation front srinagars liquor shops closed or 
switched to selling other merchandise cinemas have closed and one 
theater owner said he was thinking of converting his theater to a 
cold storage depot for potatoes 
the refrain of independence reverberates throughout the city 
before we the kashmiris used to think that independence 
was not possible but now we think it is not only possible but it 
is only a matter of time a moslem high school teacher said on 
condition of anonynity 
it is sort of romania in the making he said comparing the 
kashmir independence movement to the crumbling of the 
longentrenched communist party regimes in eastern europe 
but indian officials said fear not genuine feelings has driven 
most people to join the demonstrations 
these are stagemanaged for the press said jagmohan the 
federally appointed governor of jammukashmir state where 
escalating violence by separatist groups prompted a massive 
government crackdown jan 20 more than 160 people have died since 
then and most have been moslem protesters shot by government 
troops 
the number of hardcore terrorists will be at best 300 to 
400 said jagmohan a hindu who uses only one name as he spoke 
in the heavily fortified governors palace the socalled 
sympathy you see is just a show and some are out of fear 
events outside seemed to contradict this 
i have never seen anything like that in my life said rahul 
kapoor referring to thursdays processions of proindependence 
demonstrators 
my god it was like a revolution said kapoor a hindu 
businessman from new delhi

a state department official assigned to 
monitor dealings with a certain country heard rumors recently that 
his boss secretary of state james a baker iii was going to visit 
that country 
unable to confirm the rumors through official channels the 
official hit on the idea of asking the departments pool of 
interpreters if they had seen correspondence to the capital in 
question 
bingo they had seen enough to confirm his suspicions 
his ploy was one of many ingenious methods devised by department 
aides frustrated by lack of access to baker and a coterie of senior 
advisers who have held the reins of us foreign policy for the 
past 13 months 
not since the henry kissinger era in the 1970s has decision 
making been such a private affair among a handful of officials on 
the seventh floor of the cavernous state department building 
baker a texas attorney whose personal and political bonds with 
george bush date back 20 years prizes secrecy and direct telephone 
diplomacy with foreign leaders is not unusual 
he believes thats the best way of doing things said an 
aide familiar with bakers style you cant deal with delicate 
issues in a broad circle leaks endanger success 
access to baker is a rare and valued commodity at foggy bottom 
one of the halfdozen or so officials with easy access is 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler she was also his 
spokeswoman when he was treasury secretary in the reagan 
administration and she worked for bush in 1980 presidential 
campaign 
in her first briefing to the state department press corps last 
february tutwiler apologized for her limited knowledge of foreign 
affairs but she added i do know this president and this 
secretary of state very well 
for those out of the loop especially officials who served under 
bakers predecessor george shultz the adjustment has been 
difficult 
many are awaiting assignments that will take them abroad and 
possibly into jobs with less frustration but for those whose 
careers will keep them here for several years disgruntlement is 
running high 
none of the officials interviewed agreed to have their names 
used but their complaints were uniform 
shultz an economics professor who has returned to university 
life chose his close aides from the ranks of the career foreign 
service and relied on senior bureaucrats to help shape policy 
baker who brought all his aides with him from outside the 
department is his own point man on most major issues said one 
senior foreign service officer 
when baker wants to nudge israel and egypt toward the 
negotiating table he phones his counterparts in those countries 
he has 41 telephone extensions in his office 
officials at the bureau of near east affairs which includes the 
middle east are generally kept in the dark about highlevel talks 
several have said they learn of developments by reading the 
newspapers or from ambassadors from mideast countries 
when baker went to capitol hill last march to negotiate a contra 
aid agreement very few people in this building knew about it 
said an aide 
when reporters heard that bush was about to announce a proposal 
for troop cuts in europe in january a senior arms control official 
said he knew nothing about it 
i can assure you that only three people in this building 
know said a close baker associate 
when bush prepared to announce arms cuts in europe last june 
us representatives at nato headquarters in brussels were learned 
about it from european colleagues 
they the europeans knew about it before we did here in the 
building because baker briefed the allies said one official 
its like reading tea leaves said the official baker 
wants to control everything 
to which the secretarys close aide replied thats his 
perogative 
the aide denied that baker shuts himself off from other 
opinions on his visit to west germany last december the us 
ambassador in east germany repeatedly pressed baker to add potsdam 
and a meeting with prime minister hans modrow to his agenda 
baker was undecided until the last minute but finally decided to 
go and become the first us secretary of state to venture into 
east germany beyond east berlin 
it was good advice and the secretary was happy he took it 
said the aide

congress and the white house are all but 
certain to make changes this year in the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law which has dominated debate over the federal 
budget since its enactment in 1985 
if the revisions are major it would be the second time in its 
short life that the legislation designed to gradually force a 
balanced budget has been substantially altered 
the changes will at the very least be forced by an issue that 
lawmakers have been fixated on in recent weeks the gigantic 
surpluses accumulated each year by the social security trust fund 
but with grammrudmans declining annual deficit targets 
scheduled to expire in fiscal 1993 when the budget is supposed to 
be balanced there are other crosscurrents as well 
conservatives want to extend the deficit targets into later 
years to hold down spending for domestic programs liberals want to 
eliminate the targets soon so that social spending can expand and 
they want to have the pentagon budget and taxes play a greater role 
in cutting the deficit 
there are about 100 ideas in this place about how the process 
will be changed says senate budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn 
the driving force for the changes is the evergrowing social 
security surplus expected to be 74 billion next year alone 
critics and its become hard to find members of congress not 
sharply critical say this surplus makes the overall federal 
deficit appear smaller than it actually is easing the political 
pressure to address the budget shortfall 
the congressional budget office projects the deficit for fiscal 
1991 which begins oct 1 at 138 billion take out the 
retirement funds and the shortfall would be 212 billion 
almost everyone on capitol hill believes lawmakers will act this 
year to remove the social security surpluses from the deficit 
calculations 
we believe we should separate the social security trust funds 
from the budget and we will enact the legislation to do so 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said last week 
but that raises another problem 
grammrudman already requires that the federal deficit be sliced 
by about 37 billion next year unless the laws target is raised 
as seems likely removing social security surpluses from the 
arithmetic would force lawmakers to find 111 billion in savings a 
task considered politically impossible and risky to the economy 
a certain set of dominoes begin to fall here says house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif if the first 
decision is to move social security off grammrudman calculations 
that inevitably leads you to confront what you do with the 
remaining large deficit 
more complex proposals to change the law are also under 
consideration but all share a common element the retirement 
systems surpluses would no longer be included when the deficit is 
added up 
sasser and panetta have each offered their own plans both of 
which would put off some of the fiscal pressure republican 
congressional leaders are working with the white house on a gop 
alternative other members of both parties also have submitted 
legislation 
the target of all this is a law enacted in the middle of the 
reagan administration when the conservative president and 
democrats in congress fought to repeated budget standoffs 
with deficits growing out of control they peaked at 221 
billion in fiscal 1986 grammrudman was enacted a series of 
declining deficit targets were set leading to a balanced budget in 
1991 failure to reach the shortfall goals triggers automatic 
spending cuts on most federal programs 
congress and the white house initially lowered the deficit 
somewhat but havent made steady progress the law was eased in 
1987 to stretch out the targets to 1993 but domestic spending has 
grown and presidents reagan and bush have blocked tax hikes and 
sharp defense cuts 
critics charge that budget writers in the capitol and the white 
house have not really become adept at cutting the deficit only at 
finding loopholes around grammrudman and ignoring real deficit 
reduction 
a desirable change would be to put a dynamite charge under 
grammrudman and blow it up says henry aaron senior fellow at 
the brookings institution 
but supporters say it has focused attention on the governments 
red ink and helped force savings one of the laws authors sen 
phil gramm rtexas says the legislation should be kept alive 
until the budget is balanced 
i didnt do all this flirting just to get down to the altar 
and not get the i dos said he said

president bush and japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu met today for the second day at their desert 
summit to delve into divisive trade issues after an opening session 
focused on the us military presence in asia 
in three hours of talks today the two were expected to tackle 
thorny agenda items centering on growing us unhappiness over the 
49 billion us trade deficit with japan 
secretary of state james a baker iii met for an hour earlier 
today with japanese foreign minister taro nakayama 
bush greeted kaifu at the morningside country club saying i 
hope you got a little rest 
kaifu told bush through an interpreter i had a very good 
sleep 
bush was joined at the conference table by baker national 
security adviser brent scowcroft treasury secretary nicholas brady 
and white house chief of staff john sununu 
the trade problems were touched on only briefly in fridays 
warmup talks with both sides noting that they face difficult 
issues said shigeo takenaka deputy spokesman for the japanese 
foreign ministry 
we didnt discuss things in specific terms kaifu told 
reporters later but there was a real sense of understanding i 
sensed no irritation whatsoever during our meeting 
on trade issues in general kaifu said as you know there are 
some things that can be moved along and others that are more 
difficult 
he added that there are some structural areas where japanese 
action is absolutely necessary such as high land prices in 
japan but we must have the cooperation and understanding of 
the japanese people on these issues 
but fridays talks principally focused on defense matters us 
officials said bush and his wife barbara later held a dinner for 
kaifu at the estate of publishing magnate walter annenberg 
bush told kaifu that administration plans for a 10 percent 
reduction in us troop levels in japan will not affect either 
deterrence or stability nor its commitment to its asian allies 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
the two also discussed the us wish for japan to increase its 
24 billion annual support for us troops stationed there they 
both noted fitzwater said the need for suitable arrangements 
for balanced cost sharing 
both japanese and us officials seemed eager to put a friendly 
cast on the meeting as talks got under way 
the president told reporters at a photo session that kaifus 
twoday trip on a weeks notice was quite a significant gesture 
of friendship between our countries 
takenaka told reporters that both leaders recognized the 
importance of addressing trade issues seriously to solve these 
issues he said we must continue to strengthen cooperation in 
other areas such as aiding latin american nations and the 
emerging democracies in eastern europe 
we certainly didnt sense any ambush here he said when 
asked if the americans were coming down hard on tokyo for trade 
inequities 
bush is staying at the annenberg home in this desert resort 
before returning to washington on sunday 
kaifu arrived friday afternoon shortly after bush flew in from 
a series of appearances in the los angeles area 
in their talks today at the morningside country club bush 
planned to put kaifu on notice that congress was in a very tough 
mood about japanese barriers to trade fitzwater said 
us officials also planned to pointedly note us law that 
calls for retaliatory moves that could double the cost of japanese 
goods sold in the united states if the united states finds tokyo is 
obstructing fair trade fitzwater said 
apparently attempting to signal good faith in advance of the 
hastily called summit meeting kaifu announced before leaving tokyo 
that he was prepared to make concessions sought by the united 
states 
he outlined proposals that mirrored steps sought by the united 
states to reform the japanese economy and lifestyle in a way that 
would encourage more purchase of us imports 
the trade tensions have been intensified by escalating japanese 
investment in america 
the bushkaifu meeting comes against a background of 
congressionally set deadlines for talks on a dozen issues ranging 
from supercomputers to lumber 
in turn japan wants the united states to reduce its huge budget 
deficit and increase americans savings rate thus reducing demands 
for japanese imports 
last may the united states cited japan for alleged unfair 
barriers against the sale of american wood products satellites and 
supercomputers under the 1988 us trade law if negotiations do 
not produce removal of the barriers by june 16 the administration 
can slap on severe retaliatory tariffs 
a yearlong series of separate negotiations to resolve underlying 
causes of the trade deficit such as japans exclusionary business 
practices and americas low savings rate have left us negotiators 
frustrated at the lack of movement

during last weeks closeddoor bargaining over 
a senate clean air bill negotiators haggled over countless numbers 
but the most important number was never mentioned 
it was 60 the number of senators needed to make a compromise 
clean air bill filibusterproof and assure its senate passage 
in the months ahead through the 22 days of negotiations the number 
hung over the meeting room like a blanket of smog 
the agreement between senate leaders and the bush administration 
over clean air legislation was a major victory for senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine who instigated the closeddoor 
discussions in early february 
he will bring the bill to the senate floor for action on monday 
but while there is expected to be lively debate and attempts to 
make changes the bill likely will not be altered significantly 
the secretive negotiations criticized by environmentalists 
publicly and some senators privately were a masterful exhibition 
of legislative maneuvering and the principal goal according to 
various officials involved was to produce a bill that would not 
become the victim of regional interests on the senate floor as 
clean air legislation so often had in the past 
for years sen robert byrd dwva when he was majority 
leader blocked clean air bills regularly because controls on acid 
rain would threaten thousands of jobs in the highsulfur coal 
mining areas of his state much of the midwest and parts of the 
south rely on highsulfur coal to fuel electric power plants the 
source of most of the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain 
a bloc of 14 senators primarily from the midwest and headed by 
byrd had threatened to stall passage of legislation again spurred 
by word from utilities across the midwest that the tougher 
pollution controls would be far too costly for many of the plants 
that dot the region 
meanwhile there also were factions in the senate worried about 
other parts of the clean air bill as approved by the environment 
and public works committee senators from the west and parts of the 
south were worried that the pollution controls would inhibit future 
growth the auto industry lobbied the white house against the 
bills tough automobile emission controls enlisting sen carl 
levin dmich to argue their case in the closeddoor 
negotiations and manufacturers buttonholed anyone they could to 
tell them of the high cost of proposed controls on toxic chemical 
releases 
the dilemma facing mitchell was how to eliminate enough of the 
concerns in the bill to forge an alliance strong enough to overcome 
whatever opposition remains for that he needed the support of the 
white house 
so the private negotiations began 
the provision on controlling toxic chemicals was weakened and 
small businesses and industrial sources were exempted from 
smogcausing pollution controls the bush administration was now 
ready to accept both of those parts of the bill 
the battle then turned to dealing with the chief objections of 
the auto industry 
a provision that would have required automakers to increase the 
fuel efficiency of their cars was jettisoned early but agreement 
on auto emission controls which were targeted by the 
administration as too expensive proved to be more difficult 
mitchell trying to get the talks moving set a deadline saying 
if no agreement could be reached hed take the legislation to the 
floor anyway but the administration held some important cards as 
well without the support of the president mitchell might not have 
the votes to overcome a midwest filibuster 
white house chief of staff john sununu sent that message when 
after meeting with mitchell he suggested a rush to push the bill 
to the floor without agreement on automobile emission controls 
could be undermining the acid rain section 
so after several days of marathon meetings that lasted past 
midnight an accord was reached on the automobile issues a second 
round of controls were significantly weakened so that they may 
never go into effect 
mitchells strategy was about to bear results 
the legislation now had the support of president bush who in 
turn could be counted on to produce enough republican votes that a 
filibuster likely would be overridden no matter what the midwest 
senators did 
but there were still some loose ends 
the concerns of the senators from the west and parts of the 
south over the impact of the acid rain controls on future growth 
had to be dealt with for if they allied themselves with the 
midwest in for different reasons opposing the bill its chances 
were slim 
a provision was crafted to deal with the problem by giving 
socalled clean states additional pollution allowances to better 
handle future growth that brought another bloc of senators into 
line 
as the discussions on acid rain began the senators from the 
midwest and byrd from west virginia were now alone and outgunned 
we did not have a choice between the good the bad and the 
ugly we had a choice between ugly uglier and ugliest said sen 
christopher bond rmo recalling his travail during the private

californias attorney general has sued 
farmers insurance group claiming the states secondlargest 
insurance company has defied proposition 103 the voterapproved 
insurance reform law 
farmers has attempted to make a mockery of the law either by 
shunting some good driver applicants into a subsidiary called 
midcentury which does offer new policies but only at outrageous 
prices or by outright refusal to insure them at all attorney 
general john van de kamp said at a news conference friday 
the lawsuit was filed the same day six other companies were 
ordered by insurance commissioner roxani gillespie to issue good 
driver discount policies as mandated by proposition 103 
notices of the insurance commissions findings were sent to 
allstate insurance co chicago insurance co and interstate 
indemnity california casualty insurance co calamerican 
insurance co and clarendon national insurance co 
proposition 103 approved by voters in 1988 requires auto 
insurance rates based primarily on a drivers safety record 
experience and miles driven drivers with no more than one moving 
violation in three years are to be guaranteed lower rates 
van de kamps lawsuit filed in superior court seeks a 
preliminary injunction to force farmers to comply with a good 
driver provision in proposition 103 that states such drivers can 
get 20 percent discounts 
van de kamp a democratic gubernatorial candidate said he also 
is seeking 2500 in fines for each good driver refused insurance 
policies at the discount rate 
a spokesman for the los angelesbased insurance company said 
farmers has been wrongly accused 
farmers is absolutely complying with the good driver discount 
and filed documents with the commissioners office a couple of 
weeks ago showing its whole marketing plan for marketing good 
driver discounts said attorney leonard venger who represents 
the company on proposition 103 matters

thousands of israeli arabs have signed a 
petition urging the soviet union to stop jewish immigration to 
israel for fear the new arrivals will take away arab jobs 
organizers of the campaign said saturday 
the petition drive is a sign of the growing alienation of 
israels 800000 arab citizens 
yossi olmert head of the government press office called the 
petition drive a grave development that undermines the very 
foundations of the state 
one of israels selfdeclared reasons for existence is the 
ingathering of exiles 
arabs who are citizens are protesting the immigration of jews 
into israel and this must be seen as being orchestrated by the plo 
as part of the worldwide campaign against immigration olmert 
said 
the petition urges soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to stop 
the exodus of soviet jews which is due in part to relaxed soviet 
emigration rules and in part to fears of antisemitism in the 
soviet union 
israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750000 soviet jews 
to immigrate this decade and one government official said last 
week he expected as many as 230000 to arrive this year 
the jewish immigration from the soviet union is at the expense 
of the palestinian people this immigration will escalate the 
racial discrimination that arabs suffer said the petition which 
was written by arab nationalist activists calling themselves the 
sons of the village 
on saturday about 1000 people signed the petition in the 
northern israeli town of nazareth bringing the total in the past 
two days to more than 4000 signatures said organizer mohammed 
kayal an arab journalist he said the drive would continue for 
another two weeks and that the petition would then be sent to 
gorbachev 
the israeli arabs are really worried said atallah mansour 
another israeli arab journalist the israeli government policy 
for the past 40 years has been not to treat the arab population on 
egalitarian terms and now the arabs again have someone coming 
before them in the queue 
the main concern is that that soviet jewish immigrants will take 
away jobs from arabs who face an unemployment rate of more than 15 
percent compared to about 10 percent among israeli jews 
for the unemployed and the young university graduates this is 
a terrifying nightmare mansour said 
israeli arabs frequently complain about being treated as 
secondclass citizens for example they are barred from serving in 
the army and are thus not eligible for many benefits given 
veterans such as lowinterest loans on housing 
the concern over the influx of soviet jews has been complicated 
by fears that some might settle in the occupied west bank or gaza 
strip where palestinians are fighting for their own state 
secretary of state james a baker iii suggested thursday that 
400 million in loan guarantees to help build housing for the 
emigrants be linked to israeli promises that no new settlements 
will be built in the occupied lands 
israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the 
occupied territories and government leaders denounced bakers 
proposal friday they said that of 12000 soviet jewish immigrants 
last year only about 200 settled in the occupied territories 
also saturday 33yearold sadi abdel fatah from gazas bureij 
refugee camp died at a hospital after being stabbed and shot in the 
head by masked palestinians who suspected him of being an informer 
an arab reporter said 
the death brought to 191 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs during the uprising against israeli rule which began 
in december 1987 another 659 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians fortythree israelis have died in 
the violence 
in clashes in gaza city troops wounded four palestinians 
including an 18yearold who was in critical condition with a 
bullet in the abdomen ahli arab hospital officials said 
an army official confirmed one wounded and said he was checking 
the reports of the death in bureij and the other casualties

destabilizing castros cuba isnt the objective for 
broadcasting us television to havana says the chief of the new 
tv marti 
but if thats that result so be it 
if thats subversive said antonio navarro of tv martis aim 
to provide objective and balanced news then maybe it is but 
thats not the intent 
the potential impact of the ussponsored tv marti has taken on 
added significance with the defeat of nicaraguas leftist 
sandinistas a longtime ally of cubas communist regime cuban 
exiles in miami view the defeat as a precursor to fidel castros 
fall 
the cuban government for its part says the planned broadcasts 
are an act of aggression and an attempt to subvert the order in 
cuba the caribbean island nation 90 miles from the florida 
keys is preparing to jam the broadcasts and take retaliatory 
measures 
the united states has been broadcasting radio transmissions to 
cuba via radio marti named for cuban patriot jose marti for 
about five years last year congress provided 16 million for 
television broadcasts to cuba 
tv martis testing startup has been scheduled for midmarch 
whether or not it moves into full operation the prospect of us 
broadcasts has already further strained relations between 
washington and havana 
daily broadcasts of several hours of entertainment and sports 
programming are planned for the 90day test period said michael 
schoenfeld spokesman for voice of america which will produce the 
shows 
the broadcasts beamed to havana are expected to have a potential 
viewing audience of some 25 million people according to 
schoenfeld radio marti is heard by more than 85 percent of the 
cuban population he said 
jorge mas canosa chairman of the cuban american national 
foundation an anticastro group that lobbied for tv marti in 
congress says the tv broadcasts will have an even greater impact 
on cubans than radio marti 
tv is a much more powerful means than radio mas said 
recently it has much more impact on the public opinion 
proponents of tv marti say it will provide an alternative to the 
governmentcontrolled media in cuba one that could prove even 
more damaging to castro than news of upheaval in eastern europe and 
the soviet union via radio marti 
i believe that its going to be a big help in this moment when 
we know the regime is falling down theyll see how the rest of 
the world is said ceferino perez of the cuban municipalities in 
exile a miami group whose members are preparing to assist their 
countrymen in rebuilding cuba in the event castro is toppled 
but there has been criticism of tv marti not the least from the 
cuban government which has vehemently protested the transmissions 
are a violation of sovereignty and international broadcasting 
agreements 
besides said ariel ricardo press officer of the cuban 
interests section in washington its no secret to the cuban 
people whats going on in the world cubans are quite well 
informed through the cuban media and other sources such as the 
british broadcasting corp and miami radio stations whose powerful 
signals reach the island 
and ricardo said just because the cuban government has 
tolerated radio marti which it also opposes doesnt mean we 
consider radio marti right 
us broadcasters especially in florida are worried about 
retaliatory broadcasts from cuba or direct interference from tv 
martis signal schoenfeld says tv martis specially designed 
highly directional antenna will virtually eliminate interference to 
domestic broadcasters 
spanishlanguage programs from washington will be relayed to a 
transmitter aboard a giant balloon tethered over cudjoe key and 
then beamed to havana 
sydney head a expert on international broadcasting and author 
of world broadcast criticized tv marti calling it a 
tremendous boondoggle 
theres no purpose in it except to satisfy the zeal of cuban 
expatriots head said recently in a telephone interview from 
oceano calif theyll do anything to tweak castros nose make 
him uncomfortable 
head said tv marti is certain to capture a sizable audience 
simply because of the entertainment value of us programs compared 
with what cuba has to offer but he doesnt think it will have much 
of an effect on public opinion

the recipe was part of a sumerian hymn to 
the goddess ninkasi written in cuneiform on a clay tablet that 
dates back to 1800 bc it calls for ingredients you might not 
think of but it makes a smooth mild beer with a little fruity 
taste 
its very good professor solomon katz of the university of 
pennsylvania said as he opened a bottle they used dates to make 
it taste that way 
the bottles label had cuneiform characters calling ninkasi the 
goddess of beer the lady who fills the vessel with beer the 
label also showed one of the earliest known tablets showing two 
men using straws to sip beer from a narrownecked jar 
the beer was the culmination of two years of research by katz 
and fritz maytag owner of san franciscobased anchor brewing co 
they sampled some of the last bottles of the beer last week in 
philadelphia they had brewed about 100 barrels in august but said 
they were forced to use it up quickly since it contained no 
preservatives 
the sumerians didnt use hops which help to keep beer from 
going sour maytag said in a telephone interview from san 
francisco 
modern beer makers usually use malted or sprouted grain but 
the sumerians used baked bread which adds to the mild taste katz 
said 
they did that because the bread was almost magical to them 
katz said you could eat it for dinner or you could brew with 
it 
the cuneiform tablet originally translated in 1964 records a 
brewing process interspersed with praises to the goddess 
you are the one who soaks the malt in a jar the waves rise 
the waves fall starts one verse 
thats a brewing process katz said thats exactly what 
brewers do today to turn the grains into malt 
real brewing is very simple maytag said and we know that 
the brewers 5000 years ago were extremely skilled we ought to 
assume that these guys were just as good at brewing as we are 
by the time the ninkasi hymn was written brewing was at least 
5000 years old said katz by 2000 bc sumerian had 55 words 
describing different varieties of beer 
beer recipes are the oldest we have katz said 
katz an anthropologist specializing in nutrition believes beer 
may be the cornerstone of civilization and has argued that ancient 
man turned from hunting to farming to raise grain for beer 
barley and wheat the two main ingredients of ancient beer 
were among the first grains man began to harvest 
why did people go out and domesticate a cereal grain that 
doesnt have much nutrition katz asked they had plenty of 
other resources why would they go through the effort could it 
be because it was a source of fermented sugar 
a 1987 newspaper story about katzs theories which the 
professor also had written about caught maytags eye and led to 
the collaboration 
i thought it was intriguing maytag said it occurred to 
me we should try to make some of the beer to see what we could 
learn 
katz had to pore over many tablets to determine some of the 
finer points of the recipe 
he pointed at the translation of the ninkasi hymn 
see where it says mixing with sweet aromatics we cant 
be sure if that meant grapes raisins or dates he said they 
narrowed it down to dates using other recipe tablets from that time 
period 
maytag has no plans to market ninkasi although people have 
tried to buy it i dont think the world is ready to buy sumerian 
beer

the angolan government said air force 
planes bombed the headquarters of usbacked unita rebels for the 
second time in a week 
state television interrupted programing to broadcast a defense 
ministry statement saying two planes attacked the guerrillas bush 
stronghold at jamba on friday in retaliation for unita raids on 
economic and civilian targets 
last week the government claimed two fighter planes breached 
sophisticated ussupplied antiaircraft defenses to bomb the 
rebel headquarters at jamba 850 miles southeast of luanda 
in lisbon portugal spokesmen for the national union for the 
total independence of angola known as unita denied the government 
claims 
unitas lisbon representative alcides sakala said the 
governments sovietbuilt planes instead bombed the area of 
mavinga some 160 miles north of jamba to support a ground 
offensive launched in late december 
he insisted jamba was not hit 
there was no independent confirmation of either report 
according to the ministry statement fridays raid was in 
response to rebel attacks that left 26 civilians dead and destroyed 
a bridge in northern uige and malanje provinces 
government officials also said a unita attack on power lines 
thursday cut electricity to the central port of benguela for 36 
hours rebels cut water and electricity in luanda twice last month 
unita leader jonas savimbi urged his forces to intensify attacks 
on economic targets around the country following the government 
offensive at mavinga 
fighting has flared in recent weeks as government and rebel 
troops battle for control of the strategic airstrip and rebel base 
near mavinga 
the battle said to be the heaviest in the 15year conflict has 
darkened hopes of getting government and rebel representatives back 
to the negotiating table 
unita has been fighting to force the government to share power 
since shortly after angola gained independence from portugal in 
1975 
the rebels want free elections established by a transitional 
government as a condition for peace the government has offered 
terms based on an amnesty and integration of the rebels into 
angolan society

schlumberger ltd with a market value of 19650 according to the 
financial disclosure form he has submitted to the senate judiciary 
committee 
schlumberger a new yorkbased firm engaged in oil field 
services and oil products manufacturing has direct investments in 
south africa according to alison cooper a spokeswoman for 
investor responsibility research center a washingtonbased 
advocacy group that tracks such companies 
schlumbergers south african business accounted for less than 1 
percent of its total sales of about 5 billion last year said 
company spokesman seth mccormick schlumberger has between 40 and 
50 employees in that country he said 
dunne who faces a senate confirmation hearing wednesday 
declined to comment on the south african investments and said he 
didnt know that schlumberger did business in the whiteruled 
country 
i dont really pay any attention to this he said in a 
telephone interview friday from new york my brother handles my 
small account 
international trade sanctions applied to south africa to protest 
its apartheid policy of racial separation could cost that countrys 
economy as much as 2 billion a year according to stephen r lewis 
jr president of carlton college in northfield minn and author 
of the economics of apartheid fewer than 1 percent of all 
south africans are employed by american companies 
american companies doing business in south africa currently 
number about 120 according to steven davis a senior analyst at 
the investor responsibility research center he said the total was 
down from a high of about 300 before the united states applied a 
bar on new investment and other sanctions in 1986 
dunne reported securities investments of 179120 in a variety 
of companies including merrill lynch amp co texas instruments and 
several other technology firms cooper said none of the other 
companies did business in south africa although several have 
nonequity ties meaning they have licensing distribution or 
trade agreements in that country

africa dunne said it seems to me its the senates prerogative 
to have the first shot at me on these issues its not something 
ive discussed before and if they raise it i will respond to their 
concerns

defense and education fund a gay rights advocacy group its 
hard to comment on nothing 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
had no position on dunne according to spokesman jim williams 
were still looking at the record he said 
civil rights groups protested vigorously against bushs first 
choice for the job william lucas a former wayne county mich

joan claybrook is banking on the story of 
charles keatings lincoln savings and loan to persuade voters to 
demand changes in the way congressional elections are financed 
public citizen the organization claybrook leads is among a 
number of selfstyled public interest groups pushing congress to 
accept public financing of the campaigns with spending limits and 
significant restrictions on political action committee donations 
a new poll conducted for public citizen shows a clear majority 
of the public 58 percent supports the concept of public financing 
the highest level since just after the watergate scandal 
but the poll also found most voters know very little about the 
mechanics of public financing and are skeptical that any financing 
system would remove the influence of political action committees 
formed by special interests 
that is where claybrook hopes the story of keating and the 
widespread problems in the savings and loan industry will help 
the collapse of keatings lincoln savings and loan will cost 
taxpayers 2 billion and claybrook estimates that the 150 billion 
federal bailout of the sampl industry overall is costing each 
taxpayer about 1000 
the poll found overwhelming anger among voters who were told 
about five senators who intervened on keatings behalf with federal 
regulators who were considering seizing lincoln because of 
questionable lending and investments 
keating and associates previously had donated 600000 to the 
campaigns of causes of the five senators 
that anger according to the pollsters could provide public 
citizen and its allies with the opening they have always needed to 
persuade the public that the campaign financing system should be 
overhauled 
the scandals surrounding the savings and loan industry in 
particular have created a political moment where voters are able 
to make the conceptual link between campaign money and their own 
interests and quality of representation the analysis from the 
pollsters said 
the pollsters cautioned however that while people are unhappy 
with the current campaign finance system and increasingly skeptical 
of congress they will be difficult to mobilize 
the public though increasingly unhappy with the current 
system examines the issue through its larger political lenses 
which do not focus easily on campaign finance as a political 
issue the analysis said 
public citizen and its allies have little time to redirect the 
focus 
congressional leaders have promised to bring campaign finance 
legislation to the floor this spring but no bipartisan agreement 
is in sight and both democrats and republicans bickering among 
themselves 
lobbyists for public citizen common cause and other groups are 
increasingly skeptical that their proposals will be enacted 
the groups are hoping that a groundswell of public support will 
improve their chances and the public citizen poll contained 
evidence to convince them that a well orchestrated campaign could 
attract supporters 
most encouraging to the groups was poll data showing that 58 
percent of respondents favor the concept of public financing the 
highest level of support since immediately after the watergate 
scandal 
seventyfour percent said the congressional campaign system 
needs to be changed and 18 percent said the system is a mess and 
needs to be fundamentally reformed 
majorities supported several goals of the groups including 
limits on political action committee contributions overall 
campaign spending limits and a requirement that candidates raise 
most of their money in their home district or state 
also drawing wide support were proposals to provide each 
candidate with a fixed amount of television time and reduce mailing 
rates in return for promises of limited spending 
the public is saying that it wants congress back said 
claybrook 
yet the poll provided indications as well that there are tough 
obstacles to rallying the public behind campaign finance reform 
the nationwide poll of 1100 probable voters last month found 
campaign finance far from the top of the list of chief concerns 
just 5 percent ranked it first ahead of other issues such as drugs 
and crime the economy taxes and the environment 
the poll also found that support for public campaign financing 
the centerpiece of the changes sought by public citizen and its 
allies withered when voters were reminded their tax dollars could 
be used for negative attack ads or for support of extremist 
candidates 
the public interest groups are adopting a number of strategies 
designed to convince voters that the faults of the current system 
should outweigh their reservations about public financing 
common cause long a critic of the use of money from political 
action committees is getting personal releasing detailed lists of 
every pac donation accepted by incumbent members of congress over 
the last decade 
the us public interest research group a longtime advocate of 
clean air legislation on saturday released an analysis showing 
that pacs tied to companies and unions opposing the legislation 
have donated 274 million to senate and house candidates in the 
past decade 
for its part public citizen is combining its lobbying of 
congress with targeted field work hoping to raise public awareness 
of the issue in the districts of lawmakers who are seen as 
impediments to reform 
weve never failed to name names said claybrook 
in the poll 53 percent of respondents said they would vote for 
a challenger who supported public financing if the incumbent voted 
against it the pollsters said that reaction was probably greatly 
overstated but it still shows voters are in an antipolitical 
mood at least in part because they feel congress is more 
responsive to financial backers than constituents

nicaraguan president daniel ortega was a 
trapped man he was under pressure not only from the united states 
but also western europe and even the soviet union he was left with 
one course hold a free election 
that in the most succinct terms is the way american officials 
described the plight in which ortega found himself during the 
months leading up to last sundays historymaking election in 
nicaragua 
for years americans have been debating who lost china and who 
lost cuba now theres a new question who won nicaragua 
the debate has already started was the administration smart 
lucky or both did last sundays election vindicate or discredit 
president reagans policy of military support for the nicaraguan 
contras whatever the answers seldom has any policy fallen into 
place quite so neatly as the administrations approach to nicaragua 
secretary of state james a baker iii felt a strong sense of 
vindication last monday when former president jimmy carter in 
nicaragua as an election observer telephoned him at 415 am with 
the surprise news violeta chamorro had won in a landslide 
for a decade nicaragua seemed like just another intractable 
third world dispute it was one of those low intensity 
conflicts which appeared to be beyond resolution much like 
afghanistan angola and cambodia 
when the bush administration took office last january it was 
intent on shelving the previous policy of military support for the 
contra rebels but what other options were there for taming the 
sandinistas 
less than a month after taking office the admininistration saw 
an opening when ortega promised his central american colleagues 
that honest elections would be held in february 1990 
the reaction among many conservatives here was deep skepticism 
that ortega would keep his word but the administration decided to 
cooperate with the process switching its support from the 
externallybased contras to the internal opposition to ortega in 
nicaragua 
the administration also struck deal with the congress that in 
effect ended a decade of internal warfare here over nicaragua 
the deal while ending military aid for the contras enabled 
them to survive through us food donations as a potential future 
threat to the sandinistas until elections were held washington 
would withhold normal relations with the sandinistas 
as a show of support for democracy the administration publicly 
discouraged the rebels from engaging in armed attacks and urged the 
contra leadership to return home in peace the us embassy in 
managua quietly counseled mrs chamorros coalition to guard 
against splintering at all costs 
congress approved 9 million last fall to help mrs chamorros 
campaign and to promote nonpartisan activities such as poll 
watching and voter registration 
the united states and the central americans were not the only 
ones pressuring ortega he went to an aid donors conference in 
sweden last april hoping to raise 250 million for nicaraguas 
devastated economy and reportedly came away with only 20 million 
the europeans agreed with the united states that aid should be 
withheld until after a free election 
as outlined by us officials the soviet union the 
sandinistas chief military backer also played a constructive 
role as an example under soviet pressure the sandinistas 
promised opposition candidates last summer they would be allowed to 
campaign freely 
three weeks ago a sovietamerican statement pledged mutual 
respect for the results of free and fair elections in nicaragua 
all of these elements combined a senior administration 
official said last week helped create an environment in which 
free and fair elections were the only opportunity for the 
sandinista government to normalize relations with the rest of latin 
america and with the united states and to obtain legitimacy and 
economic aid 
but how would nicaraguans vote most of the preelection signs 
pointed to an ortega landslide and ortega himself thought he was a 
shooin 
a sandinista victory was suggested by public opinion polls in 
nicaragua most of the 55 state department officials who took part 
in a 2 office pool predicted a sandinista victory 
but the handful of officials who deal with nicaragua daily 
sensing the polls were unreliable all predicted a chamorro 
victory indeed the nicaragua desk officer craig kelly foresaw a 
55 per cent to 41 per cent win for chamorro her precise margin of 
victory

democrat walter fauntroy announced saturday he 
will run for mayor of the nations capital saying he hoped to 
heal the hurt left by incumbent marion barrys indictment on 
drug and perjury charges 
fauntroy the citys nonvoting delegate to congress since 1971 
said he reached his decision to seek the democratic nomination 
after weeks of painful and tearful consideration 
i just might be able to attract and unleash the unprecedented 
partnership of talented people required to heal the hurt and end 
the polarization in our city fauntroy told a prayer breakfast 
fauntroy 57 was an aide to civil rights leader martin luther 
king jr in the southern christian leadership conference in the 
1960s he is an ordained baptist minister 
in congress he has pushed statehood for the district of 
columbia and is the no2 democrat on the house banking committee 
as a delegate he cannot vote on the floor but may vote in 
committee 
fauntroy joins a crowded field in the democratic primary where 
the political picture was turned into turmoil by barrys drug 
arrest victory in the democratic primary has long been tantamount 
to election in washington 
barry who is being treated for substance abuse at a south 
carolina hospital has not announced his political plans but a 
recent washington post poll show the mayor would still lead a field 
of the other candidates 
barry was arrested jan 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charge he was indicted last month on cocaine possession and 
perjury charges in connection with an investigation into his ties 
to a convicted drug dealer 
the justice department has been investigating allegations that 
fauntroy had a noshow employee on his payroll fauntroys 
advisers told potential supporters last week that the justice 
department probe has been scuttled 
but a law enforcement source speaking only on condition of 
anonymity said the probe has not been abandoned

warning this story may contain explicit 
descriptions of legislation designed to brand recordings with 
sexually graphic or violent lyrics 
pennsylvanias recordlabeling bill pending in the state 
senate has whipped up a coasttocoast controversy pitting fearful 
parents and conservatives against panicky record producers 
retailers and musicians 
supporters of the bill citing tunes such as me so horny and 
necrophiliac say they are determined to save children from 
ruining their lives by monitoring their buying and listening 
habits they cite cases of teenagers who they say have committed 
murder or suicide before during or after listening to 
objectionable songs 
opponents charge the measure would be an invasion of their 
constitutional rights they say the labels would be unnecessary and 
would inhibit creativity 
state rep ron gamble the measures sponsor has touted it on 
entertainment tonight national public radios morning 
edition and in newspapers nationwide 
i didnt dream there would be such interest in the bill it 
wasnt like i had a big news conference i just introduced it and 
that was it he said but it seems to have caught on weve 
had calls from california to florida to detroit 
under the measure which has passed the state house and is now 
pending in the senate every record tape or compact disc sold in 
pennsylvania containing obscene lyrics would have to bear a 
fluorescent warning label about a dozen states are considering 
similar bills 
the label would say warning may contain explicit lyrics 
descriptive of or advocating one or more of the following suicide 
sodomy incest bestiality sadomasochism adultery sexual 
activity in a violent context murder morbid violence or use of 
illegal drugs or alcohol 
its a truth in labeling bill just like when you buy a can of 
vegetables they tell you everything thats in there with 
cigarettes too there are labels that tell you what the 
ramifications are said peg luksik president of pennsylvania 
parents commission one of the groups lobbying for the measure she 
said the group has 15000 to 20000 members 
a voluntary agreement to label records has not worked and its 
up to the government to act said michael geer president of the 
pennsylvania family institute 
representatives of the recording industry retailers 
merchandisers and civil rights groups have vowed to fight the 
measure all the way to the courts 
while i understand the concerns of the supporters of this 
amendment legislation is not the answer said a letter to 
senators from jason s berman president of the recording industry 
association of america inc 
as a father of three teenage daughters i believe i not 
recordstore owners or government should be the judge of what is 
suitable music for the home if i am not concerned with my 
childrens wellbeing no label will make a difference 
tanya blackwood of the association said the burden of the law 
will fall on recordstore owners 
it will make the retailer doublecheck everything that comes 
in the store and will force him to err on the conservative side 
rather than take a chance ms blackwood said retail stores 
will stop carrying products 
frank adams of specialty records corp in olyphant said the 
measure would wreak havoc on his business possibly leading to 
layoffs among his 2000 employees specialty makes records tapes 
and compact discs for several record labels 
it could force some of the labels to have their products made 
somewhere else adams said 
stephen macnett aide to senate republicans said the bill was 
put aside for recent automobileinsurance reform debate 
theres no plans to put it on the schedule immediately 
macnett said 
as to its chance for passage macnett said i wouldnt rule it 
out 
vincent carocci spokesman for gov robert p casey said the 
governor is aware of the bill but would not take a position until 
it crosses his desk

two americans jailed in iran for several 
years could be freed if washington agreed to release three american 
moslems imprisoned in the united states a tehran newspaper 
suggested saturday 
the englishlanguage daily kayhan international said the release 
could come after the release of western hostages held in lebanon as 
a step toward improved ties between washington and tehran in 
the posthostage era 
the newspapers mention of a posthostage era was the latest 
in a series of recent indications from iran and allied shiite 
moslem militants in lebanon that western captives held in lebanon 
could be released 
there are 18 westerners missing in lebanon most of whom are 
believed held by proiranian factions they are eight americans 
four britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an 
italian 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longestheld hostage he was kidnapped in 
beirut on march 16 1985 
iranian officials and newspapers as well as a shiite leader in 
lebanon have over the past two weeks made statements urging the 
hostages be released 
but despite the optimism this has raised in some quarters that 
a release is possible the hostages appear to be caught in the 
cross fire between irans socalled pragmatists led by president 
hashemi rafsanjani and hardline antiwestern radicals led by 
former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
this is mirrored in the shiite fundamentalist hezbollah or 
party of god which is believed to be the parent group for the 
hostageholding factions 
hezbollahs political wing supports rafsanjani who is seeking 
to improve ties with the west but the militants holding the 
captives are aligned with mohtashemi 
nonetheless kayhan internationals comments underlined that 
tehran may be seeking new openings for dialogue with the west 
particularly the united states 
the newspaper said the two american prisoners david erwin 
rabham and jon pattis could be released if washington freed 
dhorubaalmujahid elmer pratt and khalifa hammas abdul khalis 
whom it identified as political prisoners in the united states 
the newspaper suggested that the rev jesse jackson or former 
us attorney general ramsey clark could act as mediators in the 
release 
in washington a state department spokeswoman nancy beck said 
we have no comment on that other than our general policy which 
is that all of the hostages should be freed unconditionally 
pattis a 53yearold engineer was arrested in june 1986 after 
being accused of passing iranian military secrets to the central 
intelligence agency for use by iraqi bombers in the iraniraq war 
the daily referred to him as a selfconfessed cia operative 
who entered iran on an italian passport to work on a 
telecommunications project 
it said rabham a businessman who has been jailed in iran for 
about 10 years was behind bars essentially because of an 
indiscretion by former president jimmy carter 
it said rabhams crime was that after iranian militants stormed 
the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 and held 52 americans 
hostage thenpresident carter had a direct telephone 
conversation with his boyhood friend which has so far cost erwin a 
decade of his life 
no other details of rabhams jailing were given 
the militants held the 52 americans hostage for 444 days 
kayhan international said mujahid and pratt were serving a 
combined jail sentence of 40 years pratt the onetime defense 
minister of the black panthers is serving a life term for a 1972 
murder conviction 
khalis was the leader of the hanafi muslim group that in 1977 
took over three washington buildings including city hall and held 
several hundred people hostage for several days before surrendering 
a reporter was killed by a shotgun blast fired by one of the 
hanafis and thencity councilman marion barry was wounded by 
gunfire 
the iranian newspaper called the shooting death accidental and 
said the takeover was a demonstration against american justice

for friends and foes of the newly licensed 
seabrook nuclear power plant visions of the future are as 
different as the twin reactors on the site one licensed and 
ready the other rusty and unfinished 
seabrook operators and nuclear industry proponents see the 
completed reactor poised to generate electricity for up to 1 
million new englanders 
opponents see the corroded containment dome of seabrooks second 
unit as a beacon of their fight and the nations antinuclear 
movement 
by the time the nuclear regulatory commission granted seabrooks 
operating license on thursday the twinreactor plant proposed in 
1972 with a pricetag of less than 1 billion had evolved into a 
65 billion single reactor and pushed its lead owner public 
service company of new hampshire into bankruptcy 
critics have promised to appeal the nrc decision once the 
appeal is filed the us court of appeals in washington would 
decide whether the reactor can operate while the legal fight 
continues 
the focus of the court battle will be the federally required 
emergency response plans for 17 new hampshire and six massachusetts 
communities within 10 miles of the reactor seabrook is two miles 
from the massachusett line 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis became seabrooks most 
prominent antagonist in 1986 when he refused to submit emergency 
response plans for the six massachusetts communities saying safe 
evacuation was impossible 
the nrc subsequently accepted evacuation plans drafted by 
seabrooks operators 
its correct to say there has never been a case where the 
court has overturned an nrc license but its also correct to say 
that there has never been a license issued which has been so 
legally vulnerable said massachusetts attorney general james 
shannon who plans to file an appeal along with antiseabrook 
groups in new hampshire and massachusetts 
two appeals already were pending in washington even before the 
full commission approved the licensing 
arguments have been set for april on appeal of the nrcs 
decision to grant seabrook a lowpower license last may and the 
nrc licensing boards nov 9 decision to authorize a fullpower 
license also was appealed 
while plant foes look to the courts seabrook operators are 
trying to move beyond history 
in an interview friday edward brown president of seabrooks 
operator new hampshire yankee was weary of debating the merits of 
the evacuation plans 
brown instead said he would seek to mend fences with neighbors 
including some new hampshire communities that had opposed the 
plant 
we have and will continue to try to get them to work with 
us he said its a matter of taking a conciliatory approach 
not of ignoring the issue 
brown said he anticipated cooperation even from massachusetts 
once the plant was operating 
also dominating browns future is the actual startup he said 
he expects glitches and shutdowns as the reactor embarks on its 
two to threemonth process that will bring the plant to 100 
percent power 
we can expect during the fullpower ascension unless it goes 
absolutely flawlessly which would be unusual there are times 
when we will take the unit off line to do some adjustments he 
said 
a court victory for plant opponents is not in his vision of the 
future 
theyve tried it before brown said and failed

as the surprise fades away over the 
united national oppositions election victory the tough work 
begins how the sandinista front will turn over the reins of 
government to its successors 
so far the transition talks have been incredibly smooth 
its all going peacefully very peacefully presidentelect 
violeta barrios de chamorro told the associated press 
transition talks started wednesday just two days after 
president daniel ortega conceded defeat in a moving speech 
both sides lost no time in naming transition teams mrs 
chamorro chose her soninlaw and campaign manager antonio lacayo 
to head the efforts of the 14party uno coalition ortega chose his 
brother and defense minister gen humberto ortega 
after a campaign that saw the worst in the political tradition 
of mudslinging and outright threats experienced observers are 
amazed at both sides conciliatory attitude 
theyre moving around each other very very carefully an 
international observer said were doing our best to nurture that 
attitude 
the promoters and caretakers of this new cooperative attitude 
have been dubbed the holy trinity 
one of the three elliot richardson former us attorney 
general and special representative of un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar even wrote president ortega a fan letter 
your attitude today constitutes an act of true leadership 
richardson wrote of ortegas speech you can count mr 
president with my sincere admiration and respect 
la prensa mrs chamorros family daily and for the 10 years of 
sandinista rule nicaraguas only opposition newspaper has been 
emphasizing cooperation and reconciliation of this wartorn nation 
it repeatedly calls mrs chamorro a president of all 
nicaraguans 
on its front page friday la prensa ran a story with uno 
denouncing sandinista distribution of weapons to supporters and 
another story with the ussupported contra rebels saying 
sandinista soldiers are deserting 
but this time the newspaper also ran a story with a sandinista 
peoples army spokeswoman denying both reports before it would 
have derided any official denial of disruptions in the army 
some of my friends are hardline sandinistas and ive seen 
their faces theyre stunned an uno strategist said but my 
attitude is not to gloat in front of them we have to treat them 
delicately 
indeed the little that the press has been allowed to know of 
the transition talks has indicated a show of restraint and delicacy 
on both parts 
as the talks progress uno leaders have issued measured sober 
statements whose obvious intention is to calm the waters 
we are going to guarantee the orderly peaceful and democratic 
transmission of the supreme command of the republic as corresponds 
to the sacred interests of nicaragua and the desires of the 
nicaraguan people lacayo said 
calming the waters is something very much needed as the 
sandinistas nurse the wounds of defeat and deal with the alarming 
thought that some of their dearest achievements of the 
revolution might be reversed 
after his speech monday president ortega met with more than 
1000 top sandinista cadres and delivered a fiery address to 
15000 angry and fearful supporters waiting outside a convention 
hall 
the day will come when we will govern from above again because 
the sandinista national liberation front will stay with the people 
governing from below he said 
the words pointed to a sandinista commitment to play the 
political game 
except for a subsequent statement by mrs chamorro im the 
one whos going to give the orders theres been no balking by 
uno so far about the positions ortega outlined for a peaceful 
transition of power 
mutual accommodation seems to be the attitude of both parties 
just hours after ortega demanded the dismantling of the 
ussupported contra rebels mrs chamorro urged the guerrillas to 
come home and rejoin civilian life to help reconstruct nicaragua 
president bush issued a similar call to the rebels who are in 
honduran jungle camps and the honduran president sent a special 
representative to ortega and mrs chamorro to work out plans for 
the rebels decommissioning 
now it only remains to persuade the rebels to return before mrs 
chamorro is inaugurated april 25 
addressing another sandinista demand uno leaders said they will 
name a civilian defense minister but gen ortega will remain in 
command of the army 
uno will set up a special tribunal to hear claims from people 
whose property was confiscated by the sandinistas 
but peasants who benefitted from the sandinistas agrarian 
reform some 100000 families will keep their property and will 
even be given ownership titles to replace the sandinista landuse 
certificates property confiscated from dictator anastasio somoza 
will remain so 
the banking system will remain nationalized uno leaders have 
said allaying sandinista fears but true to its procapitalistic 
policies uno also plans to allow private banks 
for their part the sandinistas have allowed young soldiers to 
desert that move is geared both to weeding the armed forces of 
nonsandinista members and easing the shift to the time when mrs 
chamorro as she has promised bans the mandatory twoyear draft 
for boys age 16 
the transition talks have been at the local offices of the 
carter center former president jimmy carter considered the 
father of the holy trinity has taken the commanding lead 
in drawing uno and sandinistas to the bargaining table to talk and 
reason together 
joao baena soares the secretarygeneral of the organization of 
american states is the third component in the triad 
the short two months remaining until the new administration 
starts will be a time of great change and of promise to nicaraguas 
future 
if all goes well it will be the first time in nicaraguas 
history that one government hands over power peacefully to another 
a remarkable achievement

about 150000 people shouting 
victory democracy and down with the communist party 
demonstrated for political reform outside a downtown cathedral 
saturday 
the rally in support of bulgarias increasingly popular 
opposition was held on the anniversary of a march 3 1878 
russianturkish treaty which ended nearly 500 years of ottoman 
turkish rule of bulgaria 
the demonstration came one day after 15000 students marched 
through sofia in protest of communist rule 
the communists in bulgaria unlike those in other soviet bloc 
countries have retained much of their clout in national politics 
and their moves toward democracy have been hesitant and somewhat 
halfhearted 
meanwhile konstantin trenchev leader of the independent trade 
union podkrepa said 10000 miners went on strike friday to protest 
nonfulfillment of government pledges 
trenchev said his union has a membership of about 150000 and 
plans selected solidarity strikes nationwide 
the opposition union of democratic forces or udf organized 
saturdays rally before the alexander nevski cathedral and 
demonstrations planned for the next few days to increase pressure 
on the communists to relinquish power 
talks on bulgarias future between the communist party and the 
opposition broke down on feb 12 after the communists refused to 
sign an agreement on key political changes 
bulgarian television covered the opposition rally and showed 
official events to mark the national day including an early 
morning church ceremony attended by premier andrei lukanov 
most speakers at the demonstration compared the 500 years of 
ottoman turkish oppression with the lack of freedom and democracy 
under 45 years of communist rule 
it is a pity that the democratic evolution of the bulgarian 
people was halted by force 45 years ago udf chairman zhelyu 
zhelev told the packed squarein bulgaria like in other east 
european countries there began the establishment of a totalitarian 
society following the example of the soviet society called 
socialism

the chief defendent at the trial of 21 
former secret police officers denied saturday that officers under 
his command fired on protesters in the early days of the december 
revolution 
maj gen emil macri also alleged that members of the current 
government came to timisoara to try to suppress the revolt before 
it spread across the country 
macri and six others are accused of committing genocide and 
face life imprisonment if convicted the 14 remaining defendants 
could be jailed for up to 20 years if convicted on lesser charges 
of assisting genocide 
the revolt against the communist regime of nicolae ceausescu 
began dec 16 in timisoara where its violent suppression by 
security forces sparked nationwide reaction that eventually spread 
across the country 
ceausescu and his wife elena were tried and executed dec 25 
on charges they were responsible for the deaths of thousands of 
romanians during their harsh rule 
macri was the first to testify in the timisoara trial while he 
spoke the other 20 defendants were ordered to stay out of the 
courtroom 
macri repeatedly denied he ordered security forces to fire upon 
unarmed demonstrators claiming the securitate secret police force 
was not even issued arms in the first days of the uprising 
i was sent to timisoara on dec 17 by former securitate 
chief gen iulian vlad exclusively to find out whether there were 
any foreign spies inciting the people to rise up against the 
regime macri said 
he at times drew exclamations of disbelief from the courtroom 
macri described as a typing error his reported admission in 
pretrial questioning that the securitate shot at the people in 
timisoara adding his forces never went out in the street under 
arms 
in addition macri said col gen victor stanculescu who last 
month was appointed defense minister was sent to timisoara on dec 
17 to assist ion coman a former politburo member responsible for 
the army and police coman had been sent to the city to quash the 
revolt and is to be tried in bucharest 
macri said the interior minister in the provisional government 
gen mihai chitak was also sent to timisoara as was stefan guse 
the former chief of staff credited with bringing the military to 
the side of the revolutionaries 
macri said on dec 18 he overheard chitak tell coman the 
boys have done their job well last night he also said an 
unidentified senior securitate official in timisoara had told him 
they could sleep quietly tonight because guse is here 
he said the officers remained in timisoara until dec 22 the 
day ceausescu fled the capital and then returned to bucharest

ask democratic campaign aides if they are seeking 
gov michael s dukakis endorsement for their candidates this year 
and their first reaction is to laugh or mumble something 
unintelligible or to give a no comment 
their reaction suggests just how far the governor has fallen 
since he ran for president in 1988 during the campaign when 
dukakis appeared to have a good chance of reaching the white house 
state democrats were all too happy to have their name associated 
with the governor 
now with the states worsening budget problems democrats 
running for statewide office are wary of appearing too closely 
associated with him even dukakis has quipped that the best favor 
he he could do for one democratic candidate for state treasurer 
house speaker george keverian is to endorse the republican 
opponent joe malone 
the governor doesnt plan to endorse any democratic candidate in 
the primary according to his press secretary mindy lubber 
obviously post primary he will be far more active in the 
race lubber said for the harmony of the democratic party his 
position has always been hes going to stay out of a primary 
fight 
there was a time democrats would have lined up to court dukakis 
the level of positive support at the height of the dukakis 
administration was remarkable and the fall has been about as 
dramatic as one can imagine said paul watanabe who heads the 
political science department at the university of massachusetts in 
boston 
this year even democrats with a long history in state politics 
are calling themselves outsiders 
an endorsement by dukakis might not be the kiss of death but it 
would probably do a candidate more harm than good watanabe said 
he doubts any endorsements will be forthcoming 
my guess is he would not endorse anyone without first 
consulting them and my guess is that the advice being given at the 
campaigns at this point is to forgo an endorsement watanabe said 
state senator richard kraus a candidate for state treasurer 
laughed when asked if he was seeking the governors endorsement 
this year 
then in a diplomatic vein said it had not crossed my mind 
to ask for it 
kraus finally said an endorsement from the governor would injure 
his election bid at first blush i would have to say that it 
would probably hurt the negatives are so high right now he said 
former attorney general francis x bellotti one of the leading 
democratic contenders for governor does not really place any 
value on an endorsement at that level said ernie corrigan his 
campaign spokesman 
its just not something frank bellotti has even thought 
about corrigan said 
mark longabaugh the campaign manager for lt gov evelyn 
murphy sounded more enthusiastic about an endorsement than 
officials from other campaigns we want everybodys 
endorsement he said 
john silbers campaign spokeswoman michael regunberg said uh 
uh i dont think well comment one way or another 
and rep john flood a democrat from canton who was an outspoken 
critic of the governor even during the presidential campaign said 
he would use an endorsement of any of his party rivals against them 
obviously it would be used by the campaign as a negative 
he said 
flood acknowledged however he feels some sympathy for the 
governor 
its to the point where its sad he said except for the 
fact that he is the ceo in directing the state for the next few 
months id show some sympathy for him

president daniel ortega attended a 
mass of reconciliation saturday and joined the nations top roman 
catholic leader in appealing for peace as the sandinista party 
transfers power to a new opposition government 
i thought it was very important to send a message in favor of 
peace because i think the situation is very tense ortega said 
after the mass 
ortega and his sandinista national liberation front lost last 
sundays presidential elections to violeta barrios de chamorro of 
the united national opposition 
in a speech that has won him admiration and respect from friends 
and foes alike ortega accepted defeat and pledged to help carry 
out a smooth transition of power 
his attendance at the mass was another part of his effort to set 
an example in an effort to cool passions 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo praised ortega for gracefully 
accepting defeat in the election calling it a gesture in favor 
of democracy and freedom a gesture of greatness 
we are here to pray for peace said obando y bravo who 
hails from ortegas hometown of la libertad 
we cannot have peace if there is hatred in the heart only 
from a heart at peace can come a desire for peace he said 
many in the rank and file of the sandinista party fear that 
their revolutionary social measures may be undone by the new 
government 
there is also some concern among members of the ruling party 
over the future role of the sandinista army and the interior 
ministry security forces which are closely tied to the party 
there have been public marches by sandinista supporters urging 
that the party keep control of the army and the interior ministry 
including one through a southern managua suburb friday night in 
which protesters burned tires in the streets 
transition talks are focusing on control of the army and the 
ministrys security forces which the sandinistas dont want to 
reduce until the usbacked contra rebels disband 
those are institutions created to defend the national 
sovereignty and the lives of the people they must be preserved 
ortega said of the army and the interior ministry after mass 
in answer to a question he said the sandinistas were willing to 
work with the new government supporting everything that is in 
favor of the popular classes but rejecting everything that is not 
in the national interest 
the army security forces and militias which defeated the 
contras militarily have nearly 150000 men in arms the new 
government wants to reduce its size drastically 
ortega and his wife rosario both wearing blue jeans came to 
the small la sierrita church accompanied by their eight children 
including 1year old luciana whom they adopted recently 
we are here to show the president he is not alone said 
sergio pilarte who like many in the crowd wore the redandblack 
bandanna of the sandinista party and had come to mass with his wife 
and children

here is the statement president 
bush made saturday upon the departure of japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu following two days of talks 
well i was very pleased to welcome my friend the prime minister 
of japan here to palm springs for two days of very useful and 
farreaching discussions about the critically important 
relationship between the united states and japan 
in the first instance i wanted to see prime minister kaifu 
again and extend personally my congratulations for his victory in 
the recent elections i also want to express my very high regard 
and admiration for the outstanding leadership he has given his 
country and his party since he was propelled into office just six 
months ago 
we first met last september and in the intervening months weve 
seen some of the most momentous changes in recent world history it 
is important that the leaders of the united states and japan come 
together and review the entire scope of their relationship at this 
time of profound change in the world 
there are three things that are very clear to me that our 
relationship with japan will become even more important to us and 
to the world in the coming decades that japan is moving rapidly to 
assume a leading role in the world as was evident in prime 
minister kaifus recent trip to eastern europe and the nearly 2 
billion in assistance that he pledged to the nations of poland and 
hungary and that no matter where we look around the world from 
eastern europe to panama to cambodia the united states and japan 
are working together to promote political and economic 
transformations that will strengthen democracies and market 
economies 
our meetings these two days were not formal negotiations this 
has been an opportunity to come together and take stock of the 
entire range of our dealings from security to economics and trade 
to foreign policy and to talk about where were going together as 
we move toward the 21st century 
we talked about how we can expand even further our global 
partnership i believe that in the coming years we have a unique 
and challenging opportunity to expand even further our cooperation 
on international issues across the board to strengthen the 
political trialogue among the united states japan and our 
european allies to expand our aid cooperation to embrace a larger 
effort aimed at prmoting economic and social development in the 
third world and to think about how japan can more fully play a 
leading role in the worlds political and economic institutions 
we talked about developments of recent months in europe and 
then ussoviet relationships and i believe that were agreed 
that our two countries must work closely together to promote the 
same kind of positive change in asia i reaffirmed to prime 
minister kaifu as did secretary of defense cheney during that 
successful visit of his to tokyo that the united states is and 
will remain a pacific power that the united states attaches great 
importance the greatest importance to its security and political 
alliance with japan and that our two countries must continue to 
strengthen our defense cooperation 
at a time of great change in the world our treaty of mutual 
cooperation and security has become even more important to ensuring 
continued peace and prosperity as democracy and free markets spread 
across asia and the pacific 
we also discussed our economic relationship one of the most 
broad ranging and complex set of commercial and financial 
interactions in the entire world and there are many areas of 
economic areas in which we have close cooperation think of the 
thirdworld debt problems economic policy coordination 
collaborated there and we reaffirm our commitment to that process 
including cooperation in exchange markets 
we must also remember that japan is the second largest market in 
the world for our manufacturers and the largest market in the 
world for our farmers our exports to japan already total 44 
billion only canada buys more from us and our exports to japan 
are going up faster than our sales to the rest of the world 
the prime minister and his government are very aware of the mood 
and concern in this country about the continuing impediments to 
further growth of our trade relationship even with that 18 percent 
growth in our exports to japan last year we still have a a 49 
billion bilateral trade deficit and make no mistake about it i 
want to see that deficit come down not by restricting our markets 
or managing trade but by further increasing our exports to japan 
and so in the coming months our common task must be to further 
open markets and expand trade 
in addition to increasing our exports to japan our other key 
task is to ensure the success of the structural impediments 
initiative that we launched last summer were facing some 
important deadlines and the prime minister and i are calling on our 
officials to redouble their efforts to achieve meaningful interim 
and final results 
we must make the sii the strategic impediments initiative and 
our other trade discussions a success we must put our economic 
relationship on a solid foundation if were to achieve the full 
promise of our relationship 
we feel that weve presented some valid ideas about removing 
structural impediments in japan that will improve market access and 
reduce our trade imbalances and we look forward to the japanese 
response but lets face it these talks are a twoway street we 
americans must increase our savings reduce our budget deficit 
provide more incentive for our investors strengthen our 
educational system focus on producing goods of the highest 
quality so our task is to make the american economy even stronger 
and even more competitive and that is a task for america not for 
japan 
so mr prime minister i am delighted we had this opportunity 
to discuss all these matters i am confident that during our time 
here together we have launched a process that will continue 
throughout 1990 and the coming years a process that will create a 
breakthrough relationship and lead to an era of even greater 
cooperation between our two countries 
together we must master our problems and expand our 
opportunities by working together in partnership the united 
states and japan have the chance to lead not only our two peoples 
but the whole world into a new era of peace freedom and 
prosperity 
so mr prime minister toshiki my friend thank you for 
coming and i wish you a safe journey home and may you have great 
success in your efforts in the coming months you have our full 
support

statesmen the veteran black nationalist told a rally that zambians 
had greatly suffered because their country played host to exiles of 
the african national congress for more than two decades the anc 
has been waging a lowlevel guerrilla war against the white 
government of south africa 
i salute you for your unstinting support i salute you for 
your commitment to our struggle mandela told a boisterous crowd 
of about 10000 people at the independence stadium in lusaka 
hundreds of zambians died or were injured when south africa 
mounted military raids or sabotage attacks on anc targets in 
zambia mandela said south africa terrorized innocent people 
in zambia he said 
what greater sacrifice is there than the shedding of blood for 
other people we in south africa will not forget your sacrifices

official residence to a stadium for the rally billed as a 
celebration of mandelas release feb 11 after 27 years in south

klerk says he wants to bring disenfranchised blacks into the 
political system and gain international support for his government

restless audience zambia lost foreign investment because of its 
support for african exiles fighting for justice since its own 
independence from british colonial rule in 1964 
he said the zambian government was spurned by south africas 
longtime allies in the west because of kaundas outspoken 
opposition to the apartheid racial system zambia in central 
southern africa is one of the continents poorest nations 
the successes we have scored are to a large measure 
attributable to your support mandela said 
the stadium is in the poor lusaka district of mandevu many 
people in the crowd who waved mandela posters wore rags and had 
bare feet but they danced to the music of traditional drums 
choirs and an eightpiece jazz band

called for an end to regional conflicts in angola and mozambique 
where rightwing rebels are fighting the governments 
he was to travel to neighboring zimbabwe on sunday on the 
second threeday leg of his first foreign trip since 1962

that the sound development of economic relations between our two 
countries is indispensable to the development of not only our 
economies but that of the world economy 
although negative aspects of the issues and problems in our 
bilateral economic relations tend to be emphasized as the 
president said with profound insight the two markets are extremely 
large for each of us and our economies are moving in the right 
directions due to the adjustment efforts in the past several years 
both the us budget deficit and japans current surplus are 
being reduced and their reatios to gnp have been halved however

harder

coordination and reaffirmed his commitment including cooperation 
in exchange markets the presidents statement convinces me to make

indespensible to the future stability and prosperity of the world

consolidating our bilateral relations to be the constructive 
cooperation in this context we share the recognition that it is 
important and necessary to further strengthen and expand the 
constructive relations in the 1990s including educational and 
cultural exchanges science and technology cooperation and twoway 
technology transfers 
usjapan relations of today transcending our bilateral 
framework have acquired the significance of a global partnership 
with responsibilities for tasks facing the world the president and 
i welcome that the japanus global partnership is bearing 
specific fruit in such a broad range of fields as response to 
regional problems the management of world economy economic 
cooperation for developing countries and debt problems

concrete measures in support of the democratic government in 
nicaragua and my belief that an early economic recovery is 
important for the stabilization of panama

here is the transcript of president 
bushs news conference saturday following two days of talks with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
q mr president are you satisfied that the prime minister has 
given the sufficient political commitment to break the impasse in 
trade talks did he offer any trade concessions 
a well you heard his statement which i thought was very good 
and all i can tell you is we had perhaps the best opportunity that 
ive seen to have genuinely frank discussions i met with him 
oneonone yesterday and then last night sat next to him at 
dinner so i had an opportunity to continue the business part of 
the discussion then i heard this statement we had our other 
talks too but i heard this statement today and id say that 
that the japanese side knows how important it is to move forward 
and clearly i have a renewed feeling of how important it is for us 
to do some of the things that they were talking about on this 
structural impediments side so i cant tell you in terms of a 
specific commodity or a specific date but i we were just talking 
here and all of us are very pleased with the frankness as well as 
the spirit of cooperation that i think was reflected by the prime 
ministers statement 
q but do you think he went far enough sir 
a well nobody ever goes far enough to do everything exactly 
the way we want it but i think its i think for those who 
understand the complexities of this relationship at this juncture 
i we got everything out of this meeting that we had hoped for 
obviously weve got things to do and clearly the japanese side 
has things to do i want to say something on that meeting if i 
could the fact that he came here now finished a tough campaign 
just given a big speech to the diet indeed he gets home at 11 and 
has to go to answer questions in the diet the very next morning 
should be interpreted by americans in this manner that the 
japanese feel this relationship is very important and to the 
japanese side the fact that i invited him when i did should send a 
very important signal that we have this right up in the forefront 
of relationships that are critical and i was very grateful that he 
accepted in such short short notice this and in a complicated 
time frame this invitation 
q how confident are you that he can 
a well im hes just won a good victory there hes 
solidified his partys position he himself emerges as a i would 
say dynamic new leader and so we will simply wait and see but 
i wish him well 
q mr president there are reports out of israel that yitzhak 
shamir is prepared to accept the us formula for 
israelipalestinian peace talks do you know anything about that 
and if so what shape will it take 
a well as you know we have been working on this for eight 
months and i certainly jim baker and i were just talking about 
it and i might say i commend him for staying in there trying to 
be a catalyst to get this process going so we dont know any of 
the details of that we just talked to our top officials here but 
i hope its true and i hope we can move forward and if we do 
ill be glad to salute our secretary of state and others including 
mr shamir mr mubarak for hanging in there trying to get 
something moving toward peace david 
q has there been any movement sir if you dont know about his 
final commitment has there been any movement toward acceptance of 
the us format 
a well there has over the months but just like the real 
world you take two steps forward and take one step back i hope 
were going to go forward now yeah david 
q mr president a question about some testimony last week on 
the soviets secretary cheney said he still believes they are 
continuing with modernization director webster said in some 
testimony he thinks that the military threat seems to be receding 
in some significant respects with your experience in intelligence 
how do you explain these divergent views and have you adopted 
either of them what would you tell the american people about what 
to think about this 
a you know i get asked the question is whos the enemy 
and i answer uncertainty unpredictability and i dont see a 
great disconnect between the way you phrased the question as to 
whether they are modernizing or as to whether the threat has 
receded clearly as you see see those troops starting to move 
out of various eastern countries and as youve seen the democracies 
coming in that results in a diminished threat but it doesnt say 
that there is that everything is certain and that stability is 
guaranteed i was asked that question in relation to why i felt we 
ought to continue to have troops in europe and why i felt that it 
would be good to have a unified germany in nato and the answer is 
stability safeguard against unpredictability or instability so i 
havent gone into david the testimony of each havent read it 
but i really dont see a big conflict there craig 
q how long do you give mr kaifu to produce it seems weve 
heard this type of assurances he gave today before what are you 
looking for specifically and when are you looking for it 
a well we have some time frames we have some march talks that 
id like to see successful but look we werent here to throw down 
definitive deadlines thats not the way you deal with with 
japan in my view but the sooner the better is the way id answer 
the question 
q but were there any new initiatives mr president for 
example i mean you emphasized that this wasnt a negotiating 
session but were there any new initiatives on either side any new 
proposals for example did you recommend some way that he could be 
of assistance in nicaragua

the junior partner in west german chancellor 
helmut kohls coalition government joined poland on saturday in 
attacking kohl for his latest position on the eastern border of a 
united germany 
one member of the junior party was quoted as saying the 
government could break up over the issue if kohl persists in his 
stand 
meanwhile former west german chancellor willy brandt returned 
to east germany to do more campaigning for east german candidates 
in the march elections 
the soviet news agency tass announced in moscow that east german 
premier hans modrow will pay a working visit to moscow on 
monday and tuesday no other details were immediately available 
kohl on friday offered poland a treaty fixing its border with 
east germany but he said poland should also confirm its 1953 
decision to renounce any world war ii reparations he said poland 
should also ensure protection of the rights of ethnic germans in 
poland 
poland has pushed for the treaty to prevent a reunited germany 
from pressing claims to polish territory that was part of prewar 
germany polish officials angrily rejected kohls new proposal 
on saturday kohls own government partner the free democrat 
party added its voice to the criticism 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher was quoted by the 
luebecker nachrichten newspaper as saying the party and kohls 
christian democratic union would discuss kohls proposal at a 
special committee meeting next week 
everyone knows whoever keeps the border question open closes 
the door on german unity genscher was quoted as saying by the 
newspaper 
other members of the liberal free democrats were even more blunt 
party chairman otto graf lambsdorff said he was in no way 
happy with kohls offer he said he was surprised that the very 
delicate topic of reparations should be mentioned by our side 
the partys defense speaker olaf feldmann told west german 
state radio that polands western border was not something to be 
traded 
we germans have no territorial claims on poland we dont want 
to and will not question polands western border feldmann said 
cornelia schmalzjacobsen another leading free democrat was 
quoted as saying by the nuernberger nachrichten newspaper that the 
coalition government could be threatened by any more delays by kohl 
in openly agreeing to fixing the current border 
while kohls offer seemed aimed at assuaging criticism at home 
and abroad over his refusal to give ironclad pledges on a fixed 
border polish government officials said it only broadened the 
dispute over unification 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki said friday he was 
astonished by kohls position 
poland wants reassurance that a united germany will not claim 
lands ceded to poland after nazi germanys world war ii defeat in 
1945 
mazowiecki has demanded a seat at unification talks among the 
germanys and the victorious world war ii allies the soviet union 
united states britain and france 
kohl has repeatedly said germans have no plans to claim the 
territory but he insists only a future united german government 
can sign a binding agreement facing close races in december 
elections kohl has tried to woo a rightwing minority of voters 
who want to lay claim to the land 
in fridays statement he again avoided stating outright that a 
united germany would not claim the land which makes up about a 
third of poland 
however government spokesman dieter vogel said kohl supports 
the idea of a reunited germany signing a treaty fixing polands 
current western border 
vogel also said kohl reiterated his support for both german 
parliaments passing an identical declaration pledging to respect 
the current borders after east germany elects its first freely 
chosen parliament on march 18 
in erfurt east germany former west german chancellor brandt 
who began a thaw in relations between the two germanys there 20 
years ago returned saturday for the east german campaign 
brandt honorary chairman of the social democratic parties in 
both east and west germany waved to cheering crowds from an 
upstairs window of the erfurter hof hotel it was the same spot he 
appeared on march 19 1970 after a historic meeting with then east 
german leader willi stoph 
im very moved at this moment the veteran statesman told 
the emotional crowds packing the square its a long road we have 
behind us 
now he said the final steps to unite the two germanys must be 
taken in a responsible just and balanced manner and to a good 
final result

a well yes there was a good discussion of that and i was 
very pleased with his receptivity to helping the new democracies 
here they gave 195 or pledged 195 billion to help in the 
reconstruction in eastern europe help with the democracies there 
and he was very open minded in response to my plea to be of similar 
to be of assistance to nicaragua and panama 
so yes we had some detailed discussion about that but it 
wasnt as you know like by a certain date we would expect a 
certain like to see a certain amount of money or anything 
q anything you could tell us about any details for example a 
new way to be of assistance 
a well just that i felt a commitment on the part of the prime 
minister of japan to assist democracies and i think that is very 
important and frankly i think that will help the usjapan 
relationship because i think the people in our country as i told 
him want to see the chamorro government succeed want to see 
democracy in panama succeed so in that particular subject matter 
i was very pleased with the forthcoming comments from prime 
minister kaifu yeah 
q will you work to reduce some of the foreign aid to the largest 
recipients like egypt and israel so that you the united states 
can give more to eastern europe nicaragua and the countries that 
 
a well i am against earmarking i am for more flexibility we 
have had discussions with our congressmen including the chairman 
of the house foreign affairs committee some of those discussions 
encourage the concept of a fund that gives the president the 
flexibility to determine a certain amount of foreignaid money so 
im less interested in reducing somebody than i am getting the 
flexibility so that when you see a country come forward and try to 
solidify their democracy or work cooperatively with us in the 
caribbean as say mr manley in jamaica is doing wed like to 
be able to help him more 
q would it be a bad signal right now with israel trying to move 
toward talks with the palestinians 
a would what be a bad signal 
q would the reduction of aid to israel 
a well i dont think that i dont know that moving towards 
peace need be totally equated with aid i mean were talking about 
a quest for peace that comes not just in israel but in egypt and 
everything else so im not tying those two subjects but israel 
has some big economic problems theyve got some big problems 
facing them that require a very generous apportionment of aid 
money and they are getting that 
right here this gentleman in the middle 
q to follow on the question of aid to israel secretary baker 
has suggested that we might tie aid to resettle the soviet jews to 
an israeli willingness to not settle the west bank and to withdraw 
some of the settlements from the west bank and gaza then the 
state department seemed to equivocate on that whats your position 
more 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP900303-0112 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
a well im not sure there was equivocation my position is 
that the foreign policy of the united states says we do not believe 
there should be new settlements in the west bank or in east 
jerusalem and i will conduct that policy as if its firm which it 
is and i will be shaped in whatever decisions we make to see 
whether people can comply with that policy and thats our strongly 
held view and we think its constructive to peace the peace 
process to if israel will follow that view and so theres 
divisions in israel on this question incidentally parties are 
divided on it but this is the position of the united states and 
im not going to change that position 
q so will you link aid to resettle the soviet jews 
a well i i will just simply reiterate the policy right here 
that we are not that we are not going to look favorably upon new 
settlements yes 
q mr president before coming to this meeting the prime 
minister outlined in a speech in his own parliament new measures to 
increase foreign exports to japan and he alluded to them in his 
departure statement just a few minutes ago did you discuss those 
with him and how significant and serious do you see them to be 
a new new measures to increase 
q foreign exports us sales to japan 
a absolutely it was discussed in by me and the secretary of 
state had a good chance to discuss it with the foreign minister at 
dinner our various participants including our trade people had a 
chance to discuss with that whole concept with the rest of the 
japanese delegation and i had every opportunity to discuss it and 
so its its something theyre quite clear on we want to and we 
must increase exports i covered that in my statement and i 
listened carefully to what he said about the the deficit we have 
and the surplus they have 
q do you feel though that he has begun to make some good 
moves in the direction of 
a well im very encouraged with as i told you with or am 
encouraged by the talks weve had and i am encouraged with the 
trend that seems to be taking place but weve got to do more 
yeah sandy and then over here to owen and frank 
q mr president regarding the hostages is there any new 
movement to report is any third country particularly the french 
there are reports that perhaps french mediaries are working on 
behalf of the us to negotiate with people in either iran or 
syria 
a nice try let me tell you all something you people reported 
that i called francois mitterrand to discuss the release of some 
guy that id never heard of before and we denied it and you keep 
coming back at me im not sure i think its good for you to do 
that though because i have said that if i find a way to get these 
hostages released and the way to do it is through quiet diplomacy 
with the french the british the iranians or anybody else i 
will do it i want those hostages out of there so keep asking but 
on this case the answer to your question is no yeah owen 
q what new ideas came out of your talks to propel the trade 
dispute so that youd get more progress down the road any new 
ideas you put on the table or that the prime minister 
a to do whats that 
q new ideas that you put on the table or the prime minister did 
to propel the trade talks 
a i dont know that we need new ideas we just need new energy 
on both sides and i did say this i said youve got a new 
cabinet and some of your top cabinet officials that are not 
engaged in that are engaged will be engaged in trade 
negotiation are not here and i will tell you that our cabinet 
officials and i was thinking of carla hills thinking about 
mosbacher as well as secretary brady and as well as secretary 
baker will be on the next plane if it will help solve this 
problem and he seemed to take on board that sense of urgency 
and i im well see where we go frank 
q mr president im a little confused in your statement you 
said you did put forth new ideas and you were awaiting a response 
from the japanese im wondering if you could 
a that was one of them 
q okay is that it 
a chuckles no thats not entirely it but theres some 
were i think we covered the subject very well 
q well may i ask you sir if you believe now based on your 
discussions here that you will be able these two countries will 
be able to avoid the punitive actions specified under 
congressionally mandated deadlines 
a we had a chance to review that and to review the question of 
super 301 and we did discuss that we discussed the time frames 
involved we discussed product specificity and we all know what 
they are satellites and forest product and super computers and 
semiconductors and so yes we did get a chance to go into all of 
that 
q do you think youll be able to avoid sanctions 
a well im hopeful we will because i it is going to require 
progress but again we both sides understand the us law on 
this and i think their side understands it more clearly right now 
q mr president 36 senators wrote you a letter on forest 
products what do you tell them and the thousands of timber workers 
who think they will lose their jobs if japan takes our logs and not 
our finished lumber 
a i tell them the usjapanese relationship is important i 
tell them i want to see open markets i tell them i want to see 
progress made in that category along with the other three and 
many others that i have referenced here thats what i would tell 
them yeah 
q mr president why did mr kaifu not bring his trade minister 
a he just im not even sure i dont know what their 
confirmation process i need help that they were all totally in 
place 
q they are but just barely 
a they are but just barely they were appointed and they had 
eight hours to pack up and i guess that wasnt enough time but he 
just i think it was that they when i sent him the invitation 
and when we started dealing with who was going to come it was he 
wasnt quite sure that everything would be in place i guess id 
prefer that the japanese side answer that question yeah these two 
on the end here 
q mr president do you think these talks are going to be able 
to diffuse protectionist moves in congress

thousands of workers at some of hawaiis biggest 
hotels walked off the job saturday leaving some guests without 
fresh sheets and towels and otherwise disrupting the states 
6billionayear tourist industry 
the strike was called about 330 am by local 5 of the hotel 
employees and restaurant employees union which has 7500 members 
said spokesman rod rodriguez the unions membership had voted to 
authorize a strike by a 97 percent margin earlier in the week in 
the dispute over pay and benefits 
the strike affected 11 hotels that account for one of every five 
hotel rooms in hawaii and two of every five hotel rooms in waikiki 
the states main tourist destination 
many hotels were forced to cut back on meal and room services as 
managers scrambled to take the places of the strikers 
most of the hotels that were struck closed their restaurants and 
snack shops and the hotel restaurants that remained open had 
buffet service rather than waiting on tables there are many 
restaurants unaffected by the strike in walking distance of waikiki 
hotels 
maid service was cut severely many guests didnt get fresh 
sheets or towels unless they asked and those who did get maid 
service waited for hours 
its unfortunate considering what im paying for a room 
said jennie peters of huntington hills mich were not thinking 
of leaving though 
union and management leaders couldnt agree even on what the 
last contract offer contained 
bill crawford executive director of the council of hawaii 
hotels said the union rejected a fouryear deal that called for 
annual wage increases of 5 percent plus hikes in benefits that 
boosted the total package to around 7 percent a year 
rodriguez said the union calculated the management proposal at 
around 4 percent which he said was lower than the 5 percent 
package offered friday 
management seems to be going backwards he said the offer 
is meager and measly and shows they could really care less about 
the hotel workers 
crawford called the unions calculations voodoo economics 
he urged hotel workers to return to work 
the union is making a grave mistake he said nobody likes 
a strike but the hotels had to stand firm against totally 
unrealistic union demands that ultimately could hurt the employees 
themselves 
one management employee at the hilton hawaiian village in 
waikiki forced to work a parking booth said he didnt understand 
what the workers were striking for 
i cant believe they want a raise for this job said merv 
ching manager of the resorts valet parking system if anything 
they should get a pay cut 
guests were mixed in their views 
im a union man and i dont feel comfortable staying here 
said gary flintoff a member of painters local 64 in tacoma wash 
weve thought about going to another hotel 
tour bus operators both union and nonunion refused to enter 
enter resort property to pick up passengers in a show of support 
for the strikers tourists using those buses were forced to walk to 
hotels main entrances to board on public streets 
rodriguez said the union proposed a threeyear package that 
called for annual wages increases of 8 percent and total economic 
benefits that would boost the proposal to 10 percent a year in 
return the union would drop its demand for a 5 percent room 
surcharge and a 15 percent food and beverage surcharge that hotel 
workers would share 
management rejected the offer saying it would make their hotels 
uncompetitive 
its unreal and out of context with reality said crawford 
the strike followed a holiday taken friday by workers in 
what the union said was a goodfaith effort to try to reach an 
agreement rodriguez claimed management failed to negotiate with 
the intent of reaching a settlement and said the union would 
remain on strike until a substantial offer was made 
theres got to be something to talk about he said we are 
calling their bluff 
the hotels remained open and were being staffed by management 
there was no word if the individual hotels affected would offer 
discounts 
the affected hotels in waikiki were hilton hawaiian village 
2523 rooms sheraton waikiki 1900 rooms hyatt regency waikiki 
1230 rooms princess kalulani 1150 rooms ilikai hotel 800 
rooms sheraton moana surfrider 793 rooms royal hawaiian hotel 
526 rooms and the kahala hilton 369 rooms 
neighbor island hotels affected included the kona hilton on 
hawaii island 445 rooms sheraton kauai 456 rooms and sheraton 
maui 495 rooms

the exxon valdez with 10 of her tanks 
spouting oil was an immovable object when her skipper called out 
orders to move ahead according to expert witnesses in joseph 
hazelwoods trial 
which brought up the question can someone be convicted of 
trying to do something which is impossible 
the three witnesses whose expertise is costing the state of 
alaska about 90000 were not hired to comment on the impossiblity 
of getting the tanker off bligh reef after it went aground that 
was a defense point 
the consultants came to tell jurors that hazelwood charged with 
felony criminal mischief in the nations worst oil spill was 
reckless when he gave the order to start the engines because he 
risked capsizing or sinking the massive vessel 
but defense attorneys michael chalos and dick madson used their 
crossexaminations to suggest there was no such risk because the 
exxon valdez was firmly impaled and wasnt going anywhere 
like most legal issues the socalled impossiblity doctrine 
is a subject of debate and interpretation 
in newly filed legal briefs the prosecution contends that 
hazelwoods intentions are the paramount issue because he didnt 
know in the darkness of march 24 1989 whether his ship was 
capable of moving 
captain hazelwoods reliance on the impossibility doctrine is 
misplaced because the issue is not whether it was possible for the 
vessel to come free but whether captain hazelwoods mistakes in 
not realizing the vessel was firmly aground and not recognizing the 
danger in refloating were reasonable said the prosecutions 
brief 
the argument was offered in support of a prosecution plan to 
present the results of accident simulations showing the scientific 
probabilities of the tanker capsizing or sinking after the 
grounding 
the 987foot tanker which left valdez with a full load of 
alaska crude oil struck the jagged reef at the entry to scenic 
prince william sound its tanks were gashed spilling nearly 11 
million gallons of oil thousands of birds fish and wildlife were 
killed and black goo coated hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with the felony 
and three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel 
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
witnesses have said that hazelwood gave orders to restart the 
engines and move ahead several times they say he gave rudder 
orders which changed the ships heading but it didnt budge 
you dont know if the vessel was capable of moving even one 
inch do you chalos asked expert george kirk greiner jr 
obviously it wasnt said greiner it didnt move 
robert beevers a former tanker captain was adamant in his 
testimony that hazelwood risked further damage to the ship by 
trying to move it 
but what if it simply couldnt move asked madson 
thats what happened said beevers that doesnt mean 
he wasnt trying to get it off at that point 
the third witness salvage expert william milwee jr said 
hazelwood was reckless in trying to move the tanker because he 
didnt have enough information about the ships position 
i think it was reckless because captain hazelwood did not have 
enough knowledge of the situation to attempt an immediate 
refloating he said 
chalos confronted milwee with calculations of the tankers 
engine horsepower and the ships grounded condition 
there is absolutely no question this ship would not have moved 
using its engines alone said milwee 
no matter what captain hazelwood did asked the lawyer 
no matter what captain hazelwood did said the witness 
but captain hazelwood did nothing to try to determine that 
he continued to assert that hazelwood was reckless 
with the defense scheduled to open this week hazelwoods 
lawyers plan to present their own computer simulations of the exxon 
valdez accident and they will call experts in an effort to hammer 
home their impossibility theory 
but they are not abandoning their original position of why 
hazelwood gave the orders to move ahead they say he was trying to 
stabilize the tanker on the reef

eight captive dolphins given a passage to 
open water by an environmental groups act of sabotage instead 
huddled together in their saltwater pen and refused to swim free 
one of the wouldbe rescuers said the bottlenose dolphins 
identified with their captors at the florida keys tourist 
attraction 
when the staff at the hawks cay resort discovered openings cut 
in the underwater fence the dolphins were clustered yards away 
from a hole looking at the gap 
you could have driven a submarine through it pen manager 
kevin walsh said friday of the largest 12foot by 5foot hole in 
the plastic fence at the duck key facility about midway between the 
peninsulas tip and key west 
sea shepherd an animal rights group claimed responsibility 
friday for the effort the previous week to free the dolphins the 
sabotage was reported to the monroe county sheriffs office 
thursday 
no one at the sheriffs office saturday knew whether charges 
would be pressed in the case 
dolphins are trained at the resort before being shipped to 
seamammal pavilions across the country some were raised in 
captivity but two were captured in tampa bay for baltimores 
national aquarium last november 
ben white atlantic director of the sea shepherd conservation 
society said local members of a dolphin rescue brigade cut 
three holes in the holding pen to try to free the dolphins in 
several latenight forays with scuba equipment 
the dolphins started identifying with the captors and would 
not leave the pen white said adding young dolphins become 
dependent on human providers and prefer to stay in familiar 
environments 
meanwhile a scientist in miami said the number of dolphin 
deaths in the gulf of mexico this winter is running about three 
times normal 
a total of 162 bottlenose dolphins have been found dead from 
texas matagorda bay to tampa bay in a normal winter only about 
50 deaths are recorded in gulf waters said larry hensen of the 
national marine fisheries service 
some have been emaciated with lots of skin lesions and others 
have been nice and robust hansen said last week obviously 
something different from the normal pattern is going on but right 
now we dont know what it is 
the cold snap at christmas is known to be a contributing factor 
and a lethal strain of red tide that was implicated in a massive 
dolphin kill in 1987 and 1988 will be studied as a possibility he 
said

a i hope so but i dont know i think that depends on the 
results i oppose protectionism im going to continue to fight 
against it i want to open markets i want to see a successful 
uruguay round but and i will do from the executive branch side 
what i can but look im not unsympathetic to those that say lets 
have markets open further and that was what was good out of the 
meeting we had a chance to say that but i think the proof of the 
pudding is in the eating 
q you talked to the japanese 
a yeah and us on some areas i mean if youre talking about 
structural impediments lets get on with some of the suggestions 
they make about us on the deficit and some other areas ive told 
them that we were trying to be more competitive in going forward 
with an education program they happen to support the idea of 
capital capital gains reductions and id like to see that take 
place so its not just a oneway street yeah frank 
q mr bush a great deal of american money flows out of the 
united states through american companies purchased by the japanese 
did you discuss the question of restraint by japanese investment in 
this country and 
a no 
q why why is that not 
a because i welcome japanese investment in this country you 
know why jobs american jobs people working that wouldnt have a 
job necessarily if there wasnt that investment and we the 
japanese are not the number one in terms of foreign investment and 
so the big thing is and also the other reason frank is i 
dont want to see barriers thrown up to us investment in other 
countries 
q how about 
a so thats why its a free trade concept plus jobs for the 
american working man and woman in this country 
q how about the corollary side of 
a and it also has to do with financing a deficit that id like 
to see congress help me get down 
q did you talk about the corollary of lowering barriers to 
american investment in japan 
a yes we did yes 
q to what effect 
a well youve heard me discussing that 
q according to mr fitzwaters statement you emphasized that 
this summit should raise a conceptual framework what is the 
meaning of conceptual framework 
a well i think i touched on that in my in the calling for a 
trialogue weve asked the secretary of state to meet with the 
foreign minister of japan to discuss how we can this is the 
global effort that weve been discussing and so that i think 
that language relates to that particular part of our discussions 
q are you looking for some new structure for dialogue 
a well yes but its going to require now more conversation 
between our foreign ministries but i think as we see the world 
developing into the 90s it is essential that japan be included 
us europe and japan in a lot of these economic discussion of 
these economic areas and so thats what we were talking about 
there the global the global approach to some of these problems 
but japan is a key player there and weve got to structure some 
of these organizations accordingly i think its thoroughly 
understandable that japan with its contributions and the size of 
its economy wants to have a steppedup influence in some of the 
multilateral institutions well that would be a discussion that 
that subject would be something that would come under these 
discussions that ive just outlined 
q just to follow up 
q when you 
a you cant follow up on his question you get a new one no 
you get a new one 
q mr president when you used the conceptual framework you 
are in mind of si talks and the super 301 
a excuse me 
q when you used conceptual framework the word conceptual 
framework 
a well i just thought i just explained that to this gentleman 
here probably not as clear as i should have been but we believe 
that japan will have a more of a voice in these international 
international matters and we are moving accordingly to expand 
what traditionally or heretofore has been dialogue into three 
major factors having an input into it yes carl 
staff were going to take a final question please 
q mr president you mentioned that the japanese were aware of 
sentiment in the united states and in congress did you 
specifically mention that to them that there have been some 
letters in the past week as you probably know senator bentsen and 
congressman gephardt have said did you specifically tell them 
congress is pushing very hard on this weve got to do 
something 
a i have i had in that oneonone had the opportunity to be 
just as clear as any congressman would have liked me to be and 
where this what needs to happen to keep this terribly important 
relationship on track and similarly prime minister kaifu was as 
frank with me as to how some of what we do is viewed in japan so 
it was very good in that regard and i hadnt seen probably all the 
letters from congress but youre right theres a tremendous 
amount of interest on that and those letters were in a sense 
helpful to me because they the ones that i saw because they 
depicted a sense of urgency that i hope i was able to convey and 
that others in our party were able to convey to our japanese 
counterparts so i think in that role in that context those 
inputs were very helpful thank you all very much now 
q the bombing in panama are american servicemen at greater 
risk 
a we oppose terrorism and that seems to be a terroristic 
action and it happens regrettably all around the world and that 
would be the only answer i could give you ann so i would hope 
not the process of democratization is still strongly popular in 
panama so i dont know what that was even about but if it was 
some protest against democracy why so be it but its must be 
condemned by all thank you all very much and i hope you have a 
pleasant day i know i will 
cross talk as president bush walks away from podium 
q off mike regarding the donation to the united negro college 
fund the 50 million gift of mr annenberg 
a well its a little premature we were planning to discuss 
that but i think its a wonderful thing ive long been a 
supporter of the united negro college fund our administration has 
stepped up support for historically black colleges and 
universities the endowment concept there and i think that 
generosity inaudible is a challenge inaudible that will 
bring on welldeserved support from others its most generous and 
one of the most brilliant thousand points of light i can think of 
q how about a nova laughter

winstonsalem nc ap the war of the cigarettes is on the 
move as rj reynolds tobacco co goes headtohead with its 
competition in marlboro country trying to sell its new dakota in 
texas and tennessee 
dakota advertisements appeared in friday newspapers in areas 
around houston and nashville said david b fishel a reynolds 
spokesman the cigarettes should be on shelves within two to three 
weeks he said 
were going headtohead with marlboro so we had to go where 
marlboro is fishel said describing the testmarket regions as 
thick with marlboro smokers marlboro made by philip morris usa 
is the nations most popular brand with a 26 percent share of the 
cigarette market 
referring to protests from antismoking groups in washington 
fishel told the winstonsalem journal smokers not antismokers 
are going to make a decision on dakota 
reynolds decision to proceed with its marketing plan is in 
sharp contrast with its reaction earlier this year to discontinue 
plans to market another cigarette uptown in a test in 
philadelphia 
in both cases antismoking groups criticized the company for 
trying to sell cigarettes to consumers who are most vulnerable to 
the health risks associated with smoking tobacco 
although reynolds announced that it hoped to sell uptown to 
black smokers the company rejected claims from the advocacy 
institute that dakota ads would target young uneducated 
bluecollar women the organization based in washington supported 
its claims with marketing documents that it leaked to the media 
in abandoning uptown reynolds said adverse publicity made it 
impossible for the company to get an accurate measure of smokers 
reaction to the new brand 
because they were successful in making it a racial issue 
there was just no way we were going to get any kind of unbiased 
read on the brand fishel said 
dakota is aimed at all marlboro smokers and not at unschooled 
women fishel said he also said reynolds feels the adverse 
attention that dakota has received wouldnt affect the 
testmarketing 
the advertisements are direct in their bid to lure smokers from 
marlboro 
one of them reads we wanted to develop a new flavorful 
cigarette thats always smooth with your help its finally here 
dakota designed with the marlboro smoker in mind

six weary but jubilant adventurers from six nations 
completed a sevenmonth 3800mile trek across antarctica on skis 
and dogsleds saturday in the longest unmechanized crossing of the 
continent 
its a dangerous land without mercy coleader jeanlouis 
etienne of france told french television moments after the team 
arrived at a soviet base on the indian ocean coast 
the men were given a huge loaf of fresh bread and chugged 
champagne as the flags of their homelands flapped above them in a 
strong wind 
besides etienne the team included american coleader will 
steger of ely minn victor boyarsky of the soviet union geoff 
somers of britain quin dahe of china and keizo funatsu of japan 
interviewed on abctvs wide world of sports steger was 
asked what he intends to do now that the journey has ended he 
laughed and said take a sauna 
we can relax and join the human race again he said 
the expedition almost ended in tragedy in its final hours as 
the team struggled through a storm toward the soviet research base 
of mirnyy funatsu disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours before he 
was found friday 
steger said it was very close we were lucky we found him 
the crossing was by far the longest of its type across 
antarctica but apparently not the first without motor power 
on feb 12 italian mountaineer reinhold messner and west german 
adventurer arved fuchs completed what they said was a 1700mile 
crossing on foot without the use of sled dogs they are expected 
to arrive in frankfurt later this month to provide details of their 
journey 
etiennes team is scheduled to return to france for welcoming 
celebrations march 21 they then head to the united states for 
ceremonies in minneapolis which along with paris served as 
expedition headquarters and in washington where president bush 
is expected to meet them at the white house 
bush in a congratulatory message said your spirit of 
international friendship and cooperation not only helped make this 
fantastic journey possible but also set a wonderful example for the 
world community of nations 
the expedition undertaken at a cost of about 11 million after 
three years of planning was intended to build support for 
antarcticas preservation and demonstrate the power of 
international cooperation the members had their expenses paid but 
they received no salaries 
antarctica isnt threatened by pollution its still virgin 
and white etienne said in a hookup with reporters in paris 
all countries should forget their partisan interests and offer it 
to the world this continent belongs to everyone 
he described antarctica as huge and sometimes monstrous in 
seven months he said the only other living things seen by the 
team were their sled dogs and three birds 
experts at expedition headquarters in paris praised the 
performance of the sled dogs which were trained by steger all but 
one of the 36 dogs used on the expedition survived and a special 
highnutrition diet appeared to have kept them in excellent health 
the journey began july 28 near the tip of the antarctic 
peninsula which reaches out toward south america on dec 11 the 
team reached its halfway point becoming the first to reach the 
south pole by dogsled since roald amundsen in 1911 
the first two months were very very hard etienne said 
we started to doubt after a month whether we would make it 
it had been feared bad weather might strand the adventurers on 
the continent for as long as a month and jeopardize an elaborate 
international tour to tout the expedition 
but high winds pushed apart ice that had blocked the mirnyy 
harbor leaving a path for a ship that will take them to new 
zealand soviet antarctic officials in leningrad told cathy demoll 
the expeditions manager in paris that unless conditions change 
loading of the ship will begin monday 
the wind was howling at 70 mph and the temperature was 20 below 
zero when funatsu left a soviet mobile home where he was meeting 
with a french film crew thursday spokeswoman jennifer gasperini 
said from minnesota 
when funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner team 
members tied themselves together and searched the area for several 
hours before giving up because of darkness gasperini said the 
search resumed early friday and funatsu was found about two hours 
later she said 
etienne said that when expedition members passed funatsu calling 
keizo keizo keizo he jumped out like a mushroom from the 
snow he was in very good shape 
he had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling 
inside just as the dogs do each night to stay warm said 
gasperini who received the news from support staff

president bush and japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu concluded their desert summit saturday with 
no breakthrough on divisive trade issues but mutual promises to 
redouble efforts for resolving disputes 
kaifu said i am determined to firmly tackle the underlying 
causes of the 49 billion trade deficit with the united states and 
other economic conflicts 
make no mistake about it i want to see that deficit come 
down bush said standing alongside kaifu under a blazing sun 
near a lush golf course at a country club where they held two days 
of talks 
despite the contentious problems the two leaders went out of 
their way to show personal warmth and friendship 
bush called the prime minister toshiki my friend and the 
japanese leader referred to the president three times as george 
despite the lack of any major agreements the upbeat tone of the 
talks could give a political boost to kaifu who lacks a broad base 
of support in his party may you have great success in your 
efforts in the coming months bush said you have our full 
support 
during the discussions bush and kaifu reviewed a wide range of 
issues from the advance of democracy in eastern europe to us 
forces in the pacific 
but americas 49 billion trade deficit with japan occupied 
centerstage at the hastily arranged meeting 
kaifu agreed that the trade deficit was still very large and 
we should continue to work harder 
kaifu said that working to open japanese markets to american 
goods would be a top priority of his new government 
i told the president of my determination to maintain such 
policies as expansion of domestic demand improvement of market 
access and deregulation kaifu said he added that both he and 
bush had agreed to make maximum efforts for the early solution 
of the trade dispute 
but neither he nor bush mentioned any new proposals that had 
been advanced 
bush speaking at a press conference right after kaifus 
departure said the two sides did not need new ideas we just 
need new energy on both sides 
asked if he thought the talks could produce enough japanese 
movement to avoid possible trade sanctions bush said i hope so 
but i dont know i think it depends on results 
assessing kaifus commitment for progress bush said nobody 
ever goes far enough to do everything exactly the way we want but 
we got everything out of this meeting that we had hoped for 
both leaders promised to press forward with negotiations aimed 
at resolving a variety of divisive trade disputes 
and bush said his top cabinet officials dealing with trade 
matters would be on the next plane to tokyo if that would aid 
the talks the japanese he said understood the sense of urgency 
with which the united states views the problem 
speaking to reporters before leaving for japan kaifu called the 
next few months of negotiations extremely important although he 
cautioned that some of americas demands for the removal of trade 
barriers would be difficult to accomplish 
we have to be clear about what things will take time what we 
can accomplish and if it turns out that something is impossible we 
need to explain why kaifu said 
both leaders also said the united states has to reduce its 152 
billion budget deficit 
on other issues bush said no matter where we look around the 
world from eastern europe to panama to cambodia the united 
states and japan are working together to promote political economic 
transformations that will strengthen democracies and market 
economies 
he praised kaifu for agreeing to provide almost 2 billion in 
assistance to poland and hungary and said the two had discussed 
ways to expand even further our global partnership 
kaifu said he told bush that japan would look into economic 
assistance for central america specifically nicaragua and panama 
bush said he reaffirmed to kaifu that the united states would 
remain a pacific power and kaifu indicated he agreed with that 
decision 
before the leaders met secretary of state james a baker iii 
conferred separately with japanese foreign minister taro nakayama 
baker promised that the administration would resist 
protectionist sentiment in the united states but warned there are 
growing pressures for sanctions against japan unless trade 
frictions cool japanese officials said 
going into the discussions kaifu said action by japan was 
absolutely necessary 
his comment was seen as a positive response to us demands for 
progress in talks aimed at attacking the underlying causes of 
americas 49 billion annual trade deficit with japan and 
negotiations on trade disputes involving satellites supercomputers 
and lumber 
us officials said they did not expect any breakthrough on 
specific trade differences but hoped for a commitment from kaifu 
for action 
the two leaders met at a posh country club surrounded by 
mountains in this famous desert community home to celebrities 
ranging from bob hope to former president gerald ford bush was the 
weekend guest of millionaire publisher walter annenberg 
the hastily arranged two days of talks were aimed at defusing 
growing economic tensions that threaten to erode close political 
and security ties between the two countries 
relations between the worlds two largest economic powers have 
been strained deeply by japans massive trade surpluses amounting 
to nearly 400 billion over the last decade and surging japanese 
purchases of property and businesses in america 
moreover there are persistent complaints about japans 
exclusionary business practices 
congress facing electionyear pressures has imposed deadlines 
for talks on a dozen issues ranging from forest products to 
supercomputers and even the basic cultural foundations of the two 
societies 
for its part japan wants the united states to reduce its huge 
budget deficit and increase americans savings rate thus reducing 
demands for japanese imports 
kaifu said before the talks concluded that there are some 
structural areas where japanese action is absolutely necessary 
such as high land prices in japan but we must have the 
cooperation and understanding of the japanese people on these 
issues 
shigeo takenaka deputy spokesman for the japanese foreign 
ministry said both sides acknowledged they faced difficult 
issues on economic conflicts 
to solve these issues he said we must continue to strengthen 
cooperation in other areas such as aiding latin american nations 
and the emerging democracies in eastern europe 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas sent 
bush a letter urging him to press kaifu with all the formidable 
persuasion at your command to open the japanese market 
fridays session was devoted to security issues the united 
states is considering reducing its 120000 troops in asia by about 
10 percent or about 5000 troops in japan 
washington also is pressing tokyo for a sizable increase in 
japans 24 billion annual support for american troops stationed 
in the country 
last may the united states put japan on a hit list for 
alleged unfair barriers to american wood products satellites and 
supercomputers the administration has until june 16 to negotiate a 
removal of the barriers if negotiations fail the administration 
can impose retaliatory tariffs which japan argues would violate 
international trade law 
sen max baucus dmont and the chairman of a senate trade 
subcommittee prepared legislation that would force the 
administration to retaliate if there is no progress by june 16

authorities began to demolish 
bucharests imposing statue of vladimir lenin on saturday but 
after 10 hours of work it was clear he wasnt going without a fight 
a pneumatic drill blow torch and wrecking ball had little 
immediate effect on the 25foottall 7ton bronze statue 
he doesnt want to leave us joked florin badinici a member 
of the governing provisional council of national unity as he 
watched the effort 
the council which is acting as a miniparliament until national 
elections scheduled for may 20 voted friday night to tear down the 
statue a symbol of 45 years of communist rule that ended in 
december with a bloody revolution that toppled dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
hundreds of people clapped and cheered as workers hammered away 
at the statue in front of the massive staliniststyle state 
publishing house in the recently renamed free press square 
the workers vowed to stay through the night if necessary to 
remove the lenin 
everyone wants to have it down right away said dan popescu 
an engineer supervising the removal 
however they abandoned their work for the night about 1030 
pm with the statue still standing a few people tossed yellow 
paint at it as the workers left 
popescu said authorities originally planned to tear down the 
statue monday but changed their minds due to public pressure and 
because a romanian orthodox priest had begun a hunger strike until 
the statue was removed 
we have been improvising but even we didnt expect this to be 
that hard he said lenin is planted very well here 
popescus firm combinatul fondului plastic installed the 
statue in 1960 
right now we are ashamed he admitted 
the pink marble base of the statue was covered with blue 
graffiti reading down with the statue 
children scrambled for chunks of marble loosened by the workers 
the statue depicts lenin holding his cap and the lapel of his 
overcoat and staring into the distance down a broad avenue toward 
bucharests arch of triumph a rough imitation of the french 
monument built in 1922 to commemorate romanian unity 
authorities said they had not decided what they would do with 
the statue 
throughout the day bucharest citizens stopped to gape as cables 
from a crane were looped under the statues arms and workers 
blasted away at lenins feet with blow torches and a drill 
a crane swung a small wrecking ball into lenins arm causing 
him to shake slightly 
im very glad said ion ionescu 59 watching the 
demolition asked his opinion of lenin he glared and said ive 
been working for 40 years and i was able to buy only one car 
i didnt have holidays or days off ionescu added 
fathers hoisted children to their shoulders to watch a 
demolition worker standing in front of the statue monkeyed lenins 
pose at one point provoking laughter 
im really glad lenin is taking off said mayor dan 
predescu supervising the demolition in his place were going to 
have a real work of art

armenian and azerbaijani representatives agreed 
saturday to begin talks about peace between their republics but set 
aside the territorial dispute at the center of the violence an 
independent journalist said 
delegates from unofficial groups in the two southwestern 
republics met in the neighboring republic of georgia said 
journalist kviria dali she said they agreed the two sides should 
debate a temporary settlement but they excluded the issue of the 
disputed nagornokarabakh enclave 
azerbaijan has staunchly resisted armenian demands that it turn 
over control of predominantly armenian nagornokarabakh to armenia 
ms dali a journalist for an independent georgian news agency 
matsne said the sides agreed the proposal from azerbaijan should 
be presented to people in both republics for study the sides 
agreed to continue their talks in two months she said 
the journalist said both sides accused moscow of igniting the 
ethnic conflict that broke out in february 1988 several hundred 
people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes since 
then 
azerbaijani delegates said the representatives should 
temporarily freeze territorial complaints until the fulfillment 
of genuine independence of both of these republics in the name of 
peace between the two peoples ms dali said 
delegates represented groups such as the peoples front of 
azerbaijan and the constitution right and national 
selfdetermination groups from armenia none has official powers 
but the strength of unofficial political organizations has 
increased rapidly in the soviet union as central authority has 
weakened 
talks between representatives of the armenian and azerbaijani 
peoples fronts in the baltic republic of latvia broke down more 
than a month ago after renewed fighting

president bush said saturday aid to 
israel will be influenced by whether tel aviv allows new 
settlements in the west bank and gaza strip 
we do not believe there should be new settlements in the west 
bank or in east jerusalem bush told a news conference after 
meeting with japans prime minister toshiki kaifu i will conduct 
that policy as if it is firm 
and i will be shaped in whatever decisions we make to see 
whether people comply with that policy 
the president had been asked about secretary of state james a 
bakers statement that us aid to israel would be conditioned on a 
halt to jewish settlement of the israelioccupied territory 
baker told a congressional committee thursday that 400 million 
in loan guarantees to help build housing for soviet jewish 
emigrants should be linked to israeli promises it not be used for 
new or expanded settlements in the occupied territories 
israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the 
occupied territories and government leaders denounced bakers 
proposal friday 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
saturday that the presidents statements represented nothing new 
he said bush himself has told shamir two times that new settlements 
must end in the occupied territories 
but when bush and later fitzwater were asked directly whether 
the united states is linking aid to the settlement question they 
seemed reluctant to put it specifically in those terms 
i will just simply reiterate that the policy right here we 
are not going to look favorably upon new settlements said bush 
we havent expressed it in that policy sense directly said 
fitzwater we dont believe the settlements in the west bank and 
gaza are conducive to the peace process 
bush was also asked about reports that israels prime minister 
yitzhak shamir has agreed to consider bakers proposal for makeup 
of a palestinian delegation in preliminary peace talks 
however diplomatic sources in washington said no such decision 
has been made 
on other topics bush said 
an explosion in a panama nightclub that wounded 27 people 
seems to be a terroristic action the process of 
democratization is still strongly popular in panama so i dont 
know what that was even about but if it was some protest against 
democracy so be it but it must be condemned by all 
a pending 50 million philanthropic contribution by publishing 
magnate walter annenberg with whom bush is staying in rancho 
mirage is a wonderful thing annenberg was to donate the sum 
sunday to the united negro college fund one of bushs favorite 
charities 
there is no truth to reports that french intermediaries are 
working on behalf of the administration to free the americans held 
hostage in lebanon

a majority of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
likud cabinet ministers saturday reacted favorably to a us 
compromise for choosing palestinians for peace talks with israel 
israel radio reported 
acceptance of the compromise by hardline likud ministers would 
be a major step forward in efforts to start a palestinianisraeli 
dialogue in cairo egypt 
shamirs close ally foreign minister moshe arens presented the 
us proposal to a meeting of nine likud ministers but a final 
vote was put off until monday said shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir 
there were points that were supported there were other points 
which were viewed with suspicions ahimeir told reporters after 
the fourhour meeting 
israel television reported during the meeting that shamir had 
endorsed the us proposals ahimeir declined comment on that 
report but he said shamir had not expressed an opinion at the 
meeting 
the state radio reported that most of the likud ministers 
including arens favored the compromise solution 
environment minister roni milo said he expected the issue to 
come to a vote in the decisionmaking 12member inner cabinet 
later this week 
under the proposal by us secretary of state james a baker 
iii israel would agree in principle to delegates chosen from 
palestinians who are officially registered as residents of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the compromise would allow inclusion of palestinians who had 
been deported by israel as well as residents of occupied lands who 
worked or had apartments in israeliannexed east jerusalem 
asked about the reports that shamir might be ready to accept the 
us plan president bush said saturday he had no details 
but i hope its true and i hope we can move forward he 
said at the news conference in rancho mirage calif 
the issue of palestinian representation has been the main 
sticking point in middle east peace efforts 
likud hardliners have staunchly opposed including deportees and 
east jerusalem residents saying such acceptance would endanger 
israels claim to jerusalem as its unified capital 
palestinians have insisted their 10member negotiating team 
include representatives from east jerusalem which they want as the 
capital of a palestinian state they also demand delegates to 
represent the 3 million palestinians who live abroad 
if agreement is reached it would clear the way for baker to 
convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of egypt and israel to 
discuss the proposed delegates on a namebyname basis israel 
would have the right to reject candidates 
saturdays reports did not address another sticking point 
however the agenda for preliminary talks shamir has demanded it 
be limited to his plans for elections in the occupied territories 
palestinians want an open agenda 
the elections would be held to allow palestinians to choose 
representatives to negotiate an interim selfgovernment plan for 
the 17 million palestinians in the occupied lands palestinians 
have been waging a 27monthold uprising against israeli rule 
the hardline shamir has been under pressure from washington and 
from members of the leftofcenter labor party likuds partner in 
the coalition government to accept a compromise so talks can begin 
israel army radio reported saturday that baker told israeli 
cabinet minister yitzhak peretz during a meeting last week that if 
shamir rejected the latest us proposal washington would drop its 
mediating efforts and blame israel for the failure of middle east 
peace efforts 
baker told a us house subcommittee on thursday that we have 
done pretty much all we can do we think from our end and we are 
waiting for a response from the israeli government

the gift was scheduled to be announced sunday at annenbergs 
estate where president and mrs bush are weekend guests it would 
be the largest contribution ever to black colleges

said black colleges are a major force for positive change as 
a society we cannot afford to waste our most valuable resources 
our citizens 
comedian bill cosby made the largest contribution to a black 
college when he donated 20 million in 1987 to spelman college in 
atlanta the united negro college fund a consortium of 41 private 
black colleges raised 458 million last year for distribution to 
its member institutions 
the gift by annenberg 82 a former ambassador to great britain 
and former owner of tv guide would be one of the largest 
contributions to higher education in this country 
the largest gift to a single institution was in the late 1970s 
when robert w woodruff former chairman of the cocacola company 
gave 105 million to emory university in atlanta 
unless young blacks are brought into the mainstream of 
economic life they will continue to be on the curbstone the key to 
this problem is education annenberg told the los angeles times 
which reported the donation plans saturday as did the new york 
times 
black colleges have got to be supported annenberg said 
the entire country has to get behind this foundations 
corporations and private citizens we cant just leave this for the 
government to do 
in a prepared statement christopher edley president of the 
fund said words cannot do justice to my feelings of gratitude 
annenbergs gift is the lead contribution to the united negro 
college funds fourth capital drive which seeks to raise 540 
million for scholarships capital expenses and faculty development 
president bush is honorary chairman of the drive 
the fund was established in 1944 and has raised more than 650 
million since then the fund is well known for its motto a mind 
is a terrible thing to waste 
annenberg former owner of tv guide and other publications has 
donated 265 million to the university of southern california and 
the usc school of communications bears his name as does a school 
at the university of pennsylvania 
annenberg who served as ambassador from 1969 to 1974 built his 
fathers company triangle publications inc into a successful 
conglomerate he founded seventeen and tv guide and bought the 
philadelphia daily news in 1957 in 1988 he sold triangle for 3 
billion to rupert murdoch

prime minister margaret thatchers crusade to bury 
socialism has hit its most serious obstacle yet 
having decimated organized labor boosted share ownership and 
denationalized vast chunks of stateowned industry the prime 
target in mrs thatchers third term was to be the socialist 
bastions of local government 
but the tax reform mrs thatcher devised for the war on the 
local front combined with inflation of 8 percent and record 
interest rates of 15 percent has helped foment a rebellion 
a gallup poll published friday put the conservatives 185 points 
behind the opposition labor party their worst showing in nearly 20 
years 
on saturday thousands of protesters many selfdescribed tory 
voters marched noisily in demonstrations around the country 
the peaceful demonstrations in plymouth taunton bristol and 
manchester included families pushing strollers and senior 
citizens carrying no poll tax placards 
mrs thatchers idea seemed simple initially instead of having 
homeowners pay varying amounts of taxes on their property have 
local councils estimate their annual expenses then divide the 
costs equally among all adults in the district 
since most local councils are run by socialists and since 
socialists are big spenders the voters will quickly discover the 
cost of electing socialists mrs thatcher reasoned the new tax 
formally known as a community charge thus became known as the poll 
tax 
the government figured that under the new system which took 
effect this year each adult would pay about 472 instead as 
amounts are announced the average is shaping up to be 630 and 
surveys show most households will pay onethird more than under the 
previous system 
mrs thatcher insists that this is due to socialist profligacy 
and she accuses councils of exploiting the tax reform to rake in 
cash but high charges have also been levied in conservativerun 
districts 
a survey in the times of london on friday showed that community 
charges in only 3 of 69 local councils were close to the 472 
estimate most showed increases of 30 percent to 50 percent over 
last year 
on wednesday 18 of the 25 conservatives who controlled the west 
oxford district council resigned to protest having to charge 700 
this year instead of a planned 430 
the disillusioned tories blamed reductions in central government 
grants and higher wage and welfare bills 
reductions of up to 80 percent of community charges are 
available to students the unemployed lowincome pensioners and 
others 
but at the same time the reform means that a single person in 
an eightbedroom apartment will pay less than a couple living next 
door in three rooms since each taxable adult must pay the same 
amount 
the duke of westminster the richest man in britain previously 
paid 17415 property tax on his estate his community charge is 
709 the same as his resident chauffeur and housekeeper must pay 
i wont pay said sheila jackson a conservative voter whose 
husband earns 240 a week as a plasterer in the south england 
coastal town of weymouth 
we want to pay to our way weve worked to improve ourselves 
but now this government just makes it impossible she said in 
a telephone interview perhaps this is a case of her mrs 
thatcher being in power too long im ashamed i voted tory 
the jacksons paid 555 last year in property taxes but this 
year they face a community charge of 1140 
mrs thatcher is being blamed by worried rankandfile 
conservative lawmakers gleeful laborites and swaths of voters in 
the tory heartlands of southern england 
the media routinely refer to the community charge as the issue 
that could cost the tories the next election 
we will have to think again said lawmaker sir marcus fox 
deputy chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of rankandfile 
tory members of parliament from the prime minister downward i 
think we all now know we have a major problem 
the next election is not due until 1991 or 1992 and mrs 
thatcher has time to quiet the controversy by pouring in government 
money to cushion the hardest hit districts 
so far she has adamantly insisted that the community charge is a 
fairer system and will not be changed

the head of chinas communist party says the 
massacre of protesters in tiananmen square last june should not 
stand in the way of economic and cultural cooperation with the 
united states 
if both sides face realities and make efforts to remove the 
misunderstandings which have not been created by us we will have 
broad prospects in the future jiang zemin general secretary of 
the chinese communist party told us news amp world report 
i suggest that we look forward and try to find common 
ground he said in the interview appearing in the march 12 
issue in such fields as economic exchanges cultural contacts 
and other areas there is still a lot of room for more cooperation 
but jiang emphasized we do not regret or criticize ourselves 
for the way we handle the tiananmen event 
we believe it to be an internal affair while the us is 
saying that we have gone against us values and the american view 
of human rights 
jiang said continuing tensions with the united states resulted 
from a big misunderstanding created by inaccurate media 
accounts and a limited perspective on the part of the us 
government and people 
jiang who became party chief last june amid international 
condemnation of the chinese governments actions said his 
government would continue to welcome foreign investment and open 
the country to the outside world 
because business is not based only on one track you have to 
take the longterm view said jiang 
continued economic development in his country would help change 
us and international opinion of china he said 
the government also would gradually move away from the 
egalitarianism associated with socialist economic enterprises 
jiang said by stepping up its policy of incentive and bonus pay 
jiang said it was contradictory for the united states to 
criticize chinas use of troops in tiananmen square while saying it 
understood why the soviet union sent troops to quell riots between 
ethnic groups in azerbaijan and armenia 
additionally he criticized the us invasion of panama and 
capture of manuel noriega as a manifestation of power politics

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani on 
saturday promised economic reform and called for boosting 
industrial production to ease economic hardship that has prompted 
protests according to news reports 
rafsanjanis office also set up a 24hour hot line to handle 
complaints in the face of public frustration after a decade of 
economic troubles revolutionary turmoil and an eightyear war with 
iraq 
iranians are contending with soaring inflation shortages of 
almost all basic commodities and high unemployment all in part 
due to the war with iraq a ceasefire was reached in august 1988 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted rafsanjani as saying 
saturday the only solution for economic problems and 
revitalizing the society is to increase production 
speaking to managers of staterun industries most of which are 
operating at a loss he said we do not have political cultural 
or military difficulties currently our difficulties are mostly 
from a shortage of production 
sources in tehran reported a number of angry protests last week 
caused by popular resentment over continued economic hardship 
the mujahedeen khalq an opposition group claimed security 
forces killed several hundred protesters there has been no 
independent confirmation of that claim 
rafsanjani blamed high prices on middlemen saying they take 
advantage of the governments foreign exchange shortfall to import 
goods and sell them at exorbitant prices 
he acknowledged that keeping the iranian rial artificially 
inflated at 70 to the dollar was at the root of the economic 
problem 
the price of imported goods when converted into rials are 
prohibitively expensive and beyond the reach of most of irans 55 
million people 
the government offers the goods at a much reduced price at a 
loss to itself the subsidized imports however are too small in 
number to meet growing demand 
rafsanjani said it is not advisable to continue the past 
policy and provide all goods with the 70rial exchange rate even 
if there is sufficient foreign exchange to do so 
he added that what will save the country is that consumer 
goods are produced inside the country and are offered to the 
people at reasonable prices 
he said the countrys reliance on imported goods must be reduced 
rafsanjani said in january that factories were operating at 40 
percent of capacity 
since his election july 28 he has tried to boost the private 
sector to increase investment and encourage foreign investment to 
revitalize the economy 
but his efforts have been frustrated by antiwestern 
fundamentalist radicals in the tehran hierarchy who advocate a 
totally nationalized industry and oppose foreign investment 
rafsanjani has advocated the privatization of inefficient state 
industries which account for most of the 1 billion deficit 
projected in the 57 billion budget for the coming year

gov george deukmejian signed a bill 
saturday to require people buying rifles and shotguns to wait 15 
days for a background check saying it would keep more guns out 
of the hands of people who shouldnt have them 
this new law will give peace officers an added tool in their 
courageous efforts to protect us from violence the governor 
said it will help save the lives of many innocent victims and 
it represents a common sense approach to dealing with the criminal 
element in our society 
deukmejian announced in his weekly radio speech that he had 
signed the bill 
the sponsor of the measure assemblyman lloyd connelly said 
california is the first state to require a waiting period for 
police background checks for both pistol and longgun sales 
the new law beginning jan 1 1991 requires buyers of rifles 
and shotguns to wait 15 days and undergo the same background check 
that purchasers of handguns now have 
the new law also expands the list of people who cannot buy a gun 
the bill received impetus in january 1989 when drifter patrick 
purdy used a militarystyle assault rifle to kill five stockton 
school children and wound 29 other children and a teacher 
connellys bill was defeated in the senate in september but was 
given a second chance this month lawmakers were moved by the 
december killing of two children by their father 15 minutes after 
he bought a shotgun at a yuba city sporting goods store and the 
january killing of a sacramento woman by her estranged husband 40 
minutes after he bought a shotgun

greyhound has salted away millions of dollars to 
withstand the walkout by its bus drivers chairman fred g currey 
said sunday 
currey predicted the strike would be come irrelevant by the end 
of march if it lasts that long because the company expects to 
hire enough replacement drivers to run all its routes 
the company already has enough drivers to operate half its runs 
and has been overwhelmed with applications by people seeking to 
replace striking drivers said currey who heads the only 
nationwide bus company 
currey said greyhound would survive because it provides a needed 
service and pays well enough to attract quality employees 
currey deplored the violence including the death of a striker 
that has marred the strike i abhor it it think its nonsense i 
think its immature currey said in an interview 
greyhound was running at 25 percent saturday currey said and 
would be adding more runs each day reaching full strength by the 
end of the month 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions representing 
all 6300 drivers plus more than 3000 office and maintenance 
workers went on strike friday after the two sides failed to reach 
agreement over wage issues 
currey said 1800 unioncovered employees were at work saturday 
including 350 union drivers another 700 newly hired permanent 
replacement drivers were on board with an additional 300 expected 
to join the force next week 
we can operate 100 percent of our system this time of year 
with about 2500 drivers so 1000 is enough to operate 50 
percent of our route system after we get them evenly distributed 
across the country currey said 
thats bogus said union spokesman jeffrey nelson when 
asked about curreys count of union members at work although 
nelson couldnt provide hard figures he said union officials 
believe fewer than 10 percent of greyhounds buses were running 
currey led an investment group that paid 270 million for 
greyhound in 1987 then bought trailways lines inc four months 
later for 80 million 
prior to the buyout the drivers union agreed to a 22 percent 
wage cut but currey said greyhound drivers remain the highest paid 
in the industry 
although laden with debt including about 340 million in 
longterm obligations currey said greyhound had accumulated enough 
cash to withstand the walkout 
he would not reveal how much was earmarked but said one report 
of 54 million was a conservative estimate 
if hes got so much to cushion against a strike why isnt he 
prepared to pay drivers asked nelson the union spokesman 
currey said money spent dealing with the strike could endanger a 
100 million capital improvement program scheduled for the next 
three years including upgrading buses and terminals 
last year greyhound earned its first small profit since currey 
bought the company 730 million on 1 billion in sales in the 
previous two years greyhound lost a total 20 million 
currey said the company had modified some of its original 
contract proposals without changing the 63 million threeyear 
package 
the union has maintained the company never moved from its 
original position 
meanwhile currey said the company has asked federal courts in 
five cities to issue restraining orders against the strikes 
violence 
also weve asked ed strait the council president in view of 
not only this fatal incident but violence in other places to 
have the union join with us in going to the courts at every place 
we have employees to get a preemptive injunction to make 
certain that violators are dealt with as the criminals they are 
currey said 
union spokesman nick nichols denied that strait had been 
contacted but he repeated union calls for the walkout to be 
peaceful 
a striking driver was killed in redding calif saturday when a 
bus driven by a replacement driver was attempting to leave a 
terminal blocked by picketers 
there also has been violence in chicago where shots were fired 
on a departing bus friday morning and in philadelphia where rocks 
were thrown

two men yelling long live 
noriega threw a grenade into a discotheque frequented by us 
soldiers and wounded 27 people including 16 american military men 
witnesses and officials said saturday 
the attack late friday was believed to be the first such raid on 
us servicemen since the united states invaded panama on dec 20 
and overthrew the government of gen manuel antonio noriega one of 
the americans was reported seriously injured 
i heard something come in that broke the glass hit the table 
and then i heard the explosion said eric quintero one of the 
wounded there was a lot of confusion people screaming 
people on the floor 
there were people bleeding everywhere he said 
witnesses said the grenade landed under a table then exploded 
it left a hole about half a yard in diameter in one of the discos 
glass walls 
lisa mckay who was outside the discotheque when the 1130 pm 
attack occurred said two men drove up one got out and threw the 
bomb and they then sped away 
the men yelled there goes noriega long live noriega and 
threw the grenade she said another woman who was going into the 
disco at the time gave the same account 
panamas judicial technical police in charge of the 
investigation gave no details but an official said it was 
against the gringos he asked not to be identified 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack said lt cmdr 
peggy black a spokeswoman for the us southern command 
lt col terry jones said one of the americans was seriously 
injured thirteen others were being treated at the us militarys 
gorgas hospital and two were treated and released he said 
three of the 11 wounded panamanians had serious injuries and 
were in intensive care a social security hospital report said it 
said six panamanians were treated and released 
maj gen marc cisneros head of the southern command appealed 
for help in finding those responsible 
we ask panamanian citizens to free their society of these 
types of terrorists and criminals we must work together to bring 
these criminals to justice cisneros said during a meeting with 
panamanian police 
president bush said the attack seemed to be a terroristic 
action and it happens regrettably all around the world 
the process of democratization is still strongly popular in 
panama so i dont know what that was even about but if it was 
some protest against democracy why so be it bush said adding 
that the attack must be condemned by all 
panamanian investigators and us military police were inside 
the disco saturday looking through the debris for evidence 
american soldiers and panamanian police guarded the building and 
kept onlookers and journalists away 
the disco my place known to be popular with american 
servicemen is just off the busy via espana street and a block from 
the international banking center in panama city 
the attack occurred hours after noriegas wife three daughters 
and grandson left panama for havana as they left panama city they 
were surrounded by hundreds of jeering people who shouted go away 
beggars 
noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in miami where he was 
taken after gaining refuge in the vatican embassy in panama city 
days after us invasion he later surrendered to us authorities 
officials of the new panamanian civilian government installed at 
the start of the invasion have expressed concern that many weapons 
stockpiled by noriegas defense forces around the country still 
have not been found they say their locations are likely known to 
members of the noriegas dignity battalions and other paramilitary 
groups noriega organized 
some dignity battalion leaders have been arrested but most of 
the members appear to have returned to normal life in their 
communities 
president guillermo endara expressed sadness over the grenade 
attack 
its truly lamentable that there are people so mentally sick 
that there is an act of such senseless violence hurting innocent 
people endara told reporters 
the southern command in panama broadcast a warning over 
television telling us servicemen and citizens to avoid discos 
nightclubs cafes movie houses and other public places but 
soldiers were not restricted to bases 
the united states has about 13500 troops in panama about the 
number stationed there before the invasion 
in washington secretary of defense dick cheney taping a sunday 
talk show with cnn said panama has been a violent place in the 
past and it is still obviously a problem he said you cant 
safeguard against every possible contingency if somebody wants to 
to drive by someplace and toss a grenade i guess thats a 
possibility 
but again we dont know what happened here whether this is 
an isolated act whether it was part of some organized effort 
whether it was a group or an individual we just dont know enough 
yet to make those judgments

implementation horn told the socialist party daily nepszabadsag

alliance nato

any steps which would create tensions within the warsaw pact or 
which would dramatically put in question soviethungarian

the ruling party sunday trimmed 
proposed pay cuts that have caused unrest but opposition leaders 
said president felix houphouetboigny has already lost public 
confidence with austerity measures 
leaders of the countrys two unauthorized opposition parties 
called for elections but suggested houphouetboigny remain as a 
figurehead in this west african nation he has ruled since 
independence from france in 1960 
protesters demanding the downfall of 84yearold 
houphouetboigny accuse him of corruption robbing state coffers 
and imposing austerity measures on the poor while government 
officials enjoy lavish lifestyles 
proposals to cut government workers salaries by 15 percent to 
40 percent and increase a tax on all wage earners from 1 percent to 
11 percent have fueled increasing discontent 
also a 10year recession has provoked the worst economic crisis 
in ivorian history 
student protesters have been joined by hundreds of civil 
servants and other workers who went on strike friday 
in a bid to quell the unrest state radio sunday said the 
democratic partys political bureau proposed that only cabinet 
ministers and chairmen of state companies have their salaries cut 
by 40 percent 
the other salaries will be relatively little affected by these 
reductions while the very low salaries will be totally spared 
said the ruling body of ivory coasts only authorized political 
party 
it also proposed reducing prices of essential commodities 
lowcost housing electricity water fuel school supplies and 
drugs 
it said the statement was to reassure protesters involved in 
demonstrations which some mischiefmakers are trying to exploit 
caused by lack of information of militants and people misled by all 
kinds of rumormongers 
protests that began in abidjan on feb 19 and spread to at least 
six other towns in the past few days pose the stiffest challenge 
ever to confront the autocratic ivorian leader 
protesters have reacted violently to soldiers and police who 
have dispersed peaceful demonstrators in abidjan with tear gas and 
smoke and stun grenades demonstrators ransacked several stores in 
two abidjan suburbs friday and stoned cars and buses 
the capital was calm saturday however new protests involving 
stonings of buses cars and shop windows were reported in the 
western towns of diwo and man 
unrest that began with similar complaints forced the military 
leader of nearby benin brig gen mathieu kerekou to surrender 
political power wednesday 
union opposition and mounting unrest forced houphouetboigny to 
postpone three times a national council meeting that previously has 
routinely endorsed his decisions 
friday night the democrats political bureau announced it is 
indefinitely postponing the meeting 
world bank officials support houphouetboignys austerity 
proposals saying there is little choice to resolve a liquidity 
crisis threatening payment of civil service wages 
however opposition leader laurent gbagbo a historian who leads 
the ivorian peoples front said houphouetboigny has his back 
against the wall and should call democratic elections 
the president has ignored protesters calls for a multiparty 
democracy which he says endangers national unity on a continent 
divided by tribal rivalries 
when i heard houphouetboigny saying he was cutting salaries 
i thought he has gone mad gbagbo told reporters he used to 
be very much in touch with the people and could have carried them 
with such proposals five years ago but this shows he has lost 
touch 
the peoples misery cannot support pay cuts gbagbo said 
robert bgai tagro a former civil servant who heads the 
republican party proposed the government halt mandatory 
contributions to the ruling party by the countrys 110000 civil 
servants

thousands of mostly poor young women 
took out guaranteed student loans for a correspondence school they 
thought would train them for glamorous careers as travel agents 
but only 20 percent of the 60000 students at the american 
career training school graduated and 90 percent were saddled with 
hefty loan bills for classes some said were nearly worthless us 
senate investigators have found 
the school meanwhile profited from 150 million in loans and 
the owners became overnight millionaires said the investigators 
who this week accused act of fraud in the first of a series of 
hearings on problems in the federal student loan system 
its just too much money being unaccounted for said grace 
t mcphearson investigator for the senate permanent investigations 
subcommittee 
the school which trains travel agents and motel clerks through 
20 homestudy lessons and a threeweek residential program has 
built a recruiting network in 26 states its glossy pamphlets can 
be found in welfare offices and its ads in more than 100 newspapers 
and magazines school officials said 
acts campus is a twostory brick building with classrooms 
full of computers on a highway of outlet stores and fastfood 
restaurants a halfblock from the atlantic ocean in pompano beach 
senate investigators say evidence shows act altered documents so 
that ineligible students could qualify for loans and to make it 
appear that dropouts received the refunds they demanded when in 
fact no money had been returned 
the schools president and owner joseph a calareso repeatedly 
refused to answer the subcommittees questions monday on the 
grounds that he might incriminate himself through his attorney 
eugene propper he denied the allegations and blasted the hearing 
as unfair 
calareso a board member of the national home study council 
which accredited the school in 1985 also took steps to preempt 
further damaging publicity he hired away the study councils 
director of student assistance phillip rokicki to solve his 
financial aid problems and deal with the media 
mr calareso has sent more than 125 million back to the 
agencies to correct the errors rokicki said this week it was 
never his intention to defraud the government 
but the department of educations enforcement office has begun a 
criminal investigation into whether calareso and his brother james 
committed fraud as they earned more than 12 million in salaries 
and dividends from the school in four years 
investigators with state loan guarantee agencies in florida 
pennsylvania and massachusetts are reviewing thousands of students 
files in hopes of preventing defaults on more than 100 million in 
loans they backed for acts students 
also floridas education department is considering revoking 
acts license and the national home study council has put on hold 
its renewal of the accreditation act must have to qualify for 
federal loan money 
some 90 percent of acts students received federal loans to pay 
about 2500 in tuition and rent for a room in one of the schools 
two hotels 
but few managed to keep up with the program long enough to 
graduate investigators said 
andrea m jones of swansea sc testified that the school 
insisted she was liable for the full amount of her 2415 loan even 
though she dropped the course after claiming half the 
correspondence lessons werent mailed to her 
rokicki says his records confirm the lessons were mailed to ms 
jones he admits some mistakes such as delays in the return of 
unused tuition money to lenders but says the school is trying to 
correct them 
andrea lynn merrittswest of new smyrna beach told the 
subcommittee that only when she began looking for jobs did she 
realize that the coursework in subjects such as basic typing 
geography and airline reservation codes was hardly worth the cost 
the manager of the agency told me that he could teach me more 
about the travel industry in just a few weeks than act teaches in 
their whole process she said 
other students who are paying 150 a week to share a room with 
three to four other women at one of the calaresos hotels praised 
the school this week 
i could have got a job without coming here but i can get a 
better job now that i came said heather a student from glens 
falls ny who refused to give her last name 
but brenda ann brandon a graduate who went on to handle student 
loans for act from 1985 until she quit in 1988 told the committee 
that the calareso brothers didnt care about the financial burdens 
the school was placing on students 
joseph calareso was not concerned about the schools default 
rate she testified he told me that if we could keep the 
volume of loans high enough and the loans spread out it would take 
them forever to figure it out

the secret military mission of the 
space shuttle atlantis is set to end sunday but nasa said a storm 
front moving into southern california would affect conditions at 
the landing site 
amateur observers said they had already spotted the shuttles 
secret cargo in orbit 
nasa broke a news blackout on the flight saturday to announce 
that atlantis would land at edwards air force base calif at 108 
pm est 
generally the feeling is somewhat optimistic it the 
weather is marginal but were going to have to look at it 
realtime said nasa spokesman steve nesbitt 
the wind was expected to gust up to 29 mph at landing time with 
scattered clouds and sevenmile visibility nesbitt said saturday 
night earlier in the day forecasts called for wind gusting to 20 
mph 
that is a little beyond the gust limit nesbitt said 
the storm front was expected to make conditions worse later in 
the day and its even worse monday nesbitt said 
weather has affected atlantis mission from the beginning four 
launch delays last week were caused by poor weather a computer 
failure caused a fifth delay one short of a record for shuttle 
missions 
atlantis fivemember military crew spent most of saturday 
preparing for the return to earth but because of the secret nature 
of their mission no details were released 
pam alloway johnson space center spokeswoman said shuttle 
crews routinely spend the day before a landing doing housekeeping 
chores and testing spacecraft systems 
a twosentence statement announcing the landing time also said 
the crew is doing well and beginning landing preparations and the 
orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily 
atlantis was launched early wednesday nasa sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said the astronauts released a 500 
million spy satellite into orbit thursday sources said the 
satellite is capable of taking high resolution photos and listening 
in on electronic communications around the world 
according to sources atlantis northeasterly launch parallel 
to the east coast put it into an orbit farther north than any 
previous shuttle that would have allowed the astronauts to place 
the satellite into an orbit that crosses parts of the soviet union 
never before observed by a craft launched by the shuttle 
though nasa and the pentagon refused to give details a network 
of amateur observers led by ted molczan of toronto said they were 
able to see both the shuttle and the satellite in orbit 
molczan said in a telephone interview that an observer in 
scotland saw atlantis appearing as a bright fastmoving point of 
light pass overhead early friday the shuttle was followed about a 
minute later by a smaller object that molczan said apparently was 
the satellite 
later around dawn over north america molczan said observers in 
yellowknife white horse and hay river in canada and in 
fairbanks alaska reported sightings 
for those sightings the payload satellite came over at the 
time we predicted for the orbiter said molczan the orbiter 
was seen earlier this means that the orbiter had dropped into a 
lower orbit 
such a maneuver would put distance between the two craft since a 
lower object orbits faster on a later pass over the observers 
there was even more separation he said 
molczan calculated that the satellite was in an orbit of 161 
miles and the shuttle was at about 152 miles 
the shuttle and the satellite are extremely bright said 
molczan brighter than any star 
atlantis flight is the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth 
dedicated solely to the military 
navy capt john o creighton is the commander others in the 
crew are air force col john h casper the pilot and mission

arthur a fletcher said friday he hopes to 
make discrimination an insignificant part of american life during 
his tenure as chairman of the us civil rights commission 
as a general mission i would like to see us set as an 
objective the goal of reducing discrimination to a level of 
insignificance by creating an environment in which the so 
what theory operates said fletcher 
in that environment fletcher said he believed employers would 
examinine the qualifications performance and competence of 
individuals without considering potential workers gender race 
religion or disability 
fletcher said he envisioned employers saying so what upon 
learning subsequently that qualified prospective employees were 
africanamerican hispanic women or other minorities 
fletcher outlined the goal to members of the commission at the 
panels first meeting of the year and its first since his 
appointment last month by president bush 
the commission established in 1957 evaluates federal laws 
monitors the governments equal opportunity programs and serves as 
a clearinghouse for civil rights information 
fletcher said the commission should once again become the 
recognized authority on civil rights matters 
in november congress approved lastminute compromise 
legislation to extend the life of the commission for two years 
the commission was criticized by civil rights groups and members 
of congress for its positions including opposition to affirmative 
action programs during the reagan administration 
i would like to see this commission participate in causing 
economic opportunity to become the driving force behind the us 
civil rights agenda fletcher said 
such an agenda would respond to an open free market economy 
both domestically and internationallly he said 
i am convinced that our success or failure in that economy 
will rest squarely on how well we develop our human resources 
and the extent to which we let them perform at their peak 
performance level at the workplace and other places and reward them 
accordingly he added 
fletcher 65 a moderate black republican who has served in 
three gop administrations also said he would work to restore 
bipartisanship to civil rights activity 
although the perception is that civil rights has been solely a 
democratic party enterprise there was always the need for 
republican votes to pass civil rights legislation he said 
also attending fridays meeting were two other new commissioners 
appointed last month virginia attorney carl a anderson and 
russell g redenbaugh a blind philadelphia business executive 
there is one vacancy on the eightmember commission 
the panel agreed its april meeting would be a twoday retreat 
focusing on restoring a colleagial atmosphere to the group 
under former chairman william b allen who is still a 
commission member the panel was marked by controversy and 
confrontation between he and other commissioners 
a speech titled blacks animals homosexuals what is a 
minority delivered by allen to a conservative group was 
condemned by the commissioned as thoughtless disgusting and 
unnecessarily inflammatory

british astronomers searching for quasars in far 
outer space said friday they believe they have stumbled across an 
undiscovered galaxy in our back yard 
they said if their finding is confirmed it is the first new 
galaxy discovered in 35 years 
richard mcmahon of the cambridge university institute of 
astronomy said he and colleague michael irwin discovered the very 
dim dwarf galaxy two weeks ago he said they are doublechecking 
to make sure no one spotted it before 
its a bit like discovering a new planet its an exciting 
discovery mcmahon said we usually work in a more distant part 
of the universe and we pretty much assume that everything is 
already known about the vicinity of the milky way the galaxy 
around earth 
the scientists used a seventon computerized laser machine that 
scans detailed photographic plates of space 
after the plates are scanned the data are computerized to 
look for more subtle variations mcmahon said all the easy 
galaxies have been found by the eye the machine finds the harder 
ones the nearer ones are not so easy to see because the bright 
background of the milky way blurs the picture 
the galaxy named sextans after the constellation where it was 
found is the smallest of the 10 satellite galaxies of the milky 
way the astronomers said in telephone interviews 
the dwarf spherical galaxy is 100000 times fainter than the 
milky way and cannot be seen without a powerful telescope they 
said 
the sun is 30000 lightyears from the center of the milky 
way and this particular galaxy is a factor of 10 farther out the 
edge of the visible universe is about 15000 million lightyears 
away so this is basically in our back yard irwin said 
a lightyear is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 
one year 
the scientists said they will follow up their finding with a 
more detailed study of sextans they predicted that five or six 
more galaxies would be found within the next three years 
the odds are there wont be too many more found if we find 
them fine if we dont its all right as long as we keep 
churning out the unusual stuff said irwin adding that he and 
mcmahon consider themselves specialists in quasars not galaxies 
quasars are starlike objects that emit huge amounts of light 
they are thought to be the ancient traces of the exploding origins 
of new galaxies

us rep james a courter who lost his 
bid for governor last year to democrat jim florio said friday he 
would not seek a seventh term in congress so he can spend more time 
with his family 
the conservative republican congressman made the surprise 
announcement at a news conference in the heart of his 12th 
congressional district 
two weeks ago courter announced that he would take a prochoice 
stance on abortion in what many believed was a precursor to his 
congressional campaign 
flanked by his wife carmen and two daughters katrina and 
donica courter said he will leave his seat with a sense of 
accomplishment and a degree of sadness 
courter flashed a familiar smile as he stepped up for the news 
conference but as he spoke his eyes moistened and his voice 
occasionally cracked he declined to answer questions promising to 
elaborate soon on his decision to step down 
hugging his wife he said ive never asked this before but 
id like to spend some time with them 
theyve been a source of strength and inspiration and guidance 
during the good and the bad he said because of my family ive 
decided not to seek reelection 
its a decision im at peace with he added when i first 
ran for congress i said i would serve for 10 years i guess this 
announcement is coming two years too late 
courter a 48yearold attorney did not reveal any plans for 
the future he scarcely mentioned the gubernatorial race but has 
acknowledged in the past that the campaign had been difficult for 
his family to endure 
after winning a tough republican primary courters campaign was 
damaged by what was seen as his changing stance on abortion rights 
and he was soundly defeated in his bid to succeed republican gov 
thomas h kean 
courter was hurt politically by the loss but analysts said he 
retained his popularity in his heavily republican home base and 
would have been oddson favorite to win another term in congress 
courter who served as a key member of the house armed services 
committee and later on the irancontra committee was first elected 
in 1978 in an upset victory that presaged the republican gains of 
1980 he easily won reelection five times and was a staunch 
supporter of president ronald reagan 
courter said the reagan policies were responsible for the 
sweeping change in south america central america asia and 
europe 
i was glad to be a part of the process to get the us back on 
its feet again courter said

in a rare show of unity prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and labor party leaders friday defended resettlement 
policies in the face of us threats to withhold aid if soviet jews 
are allowed to settle in occupied lands 
shamir of the rightwing likud bloc said the bush 
administration should reconsider its position raised thursday in 
washington by secretary of state james a baker iii 
labor party leader shimon peres his rival and partner in the 
coalition government agreed 
we cannot forbid an immigrant to settle wherever he wants 
but basically we do not intend to build new settlements in the 
occupied lands peres said 
at a hearing before the house appropriations foreign aid 
subcommittee baker said the administration could endorse giving 
israel 400 million in loan guarantees to build housing for soviet 
jews but only if israel promises not to put any new settlers in 
the west bank or gaza strip 
israel maintains it has no policy of settling jewish immigrants 
in the occupied territories captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war it says that of 12000 soviet jews who came 
to israel last year 200 settled in the west bank or gaza strip 
we do not accept this american position and we intend holding 
a thorough discussion with the us administration shamir said 
in a statement 
the linkage of the issue of immigration and the problem of 
settlements was completely unnecessary 
stronger statements came from rightwing legislators and 
settlement leaders some proposed increasing jewish settlements in 
the west bank and gaza strip to underscore israels displeasure 
likud legislator benjamin begin son of former premier menachem 
begin said it was inconceivable that jews would be barred from 
living anywhere in their historical homeland 
avner shaki a parliament member from the national religious 
party said bakers remarks amounted to an unprecedented 
intervention in israels internal affairs 
rafael eitan head of the rightwing tsomet party urged 
expanding the settlements 
about 70000 jews live in the gaza strip and west bank along 
with 17 million palestinians who are campaigning for an 
independent state during the 27monthold palestinian uprising in 
the occupied lands 659 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers and civilians and 43 israelis have been killed 
the united states considers further jewish settlements obstacles 
to peace 
in a sign of the touchiness of the issue publication of monthly 
soviet immigration figures now will be subject to review by the 
military censor 
the censors office said friday all material pertaining to 
immigration of soviet jews must be submitted to the censor prior to 
publication censors are not expected to release the data so the 
process is expected to amount to a ban 
maariv newspaper said the decision followed this weeks estimate 
that up to 230000 soviet jews will come to israel this year not 
80000 to 100000 as estimated earlier 
maariv said the newest estimate created panic in the arab 
countries and the protests coming from these countries endanger 
immigration 
the issue raised tempers at a time when shamir is already under 
pressure at home and in washington to get usmediated peace talks 
started with palestinians 
the state department tried to smooth over the dispute friday 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said baker called shamir to 
emphasize us support for continued jewish emigration from the 
soviet union but she said washington still wanted assurances that 
usfunded housing would not be used in the occupied territories

the international press institute said friday it 
has protested to the soviet union over the detention of three 
turkish journalists in the soviet republic of azerbaijan 
institute director peter galliner said he wrote to soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev on tuesday to request the release of 
the three newspaper reporters detained feb 19 in the city of baku

hundreds of writers editors and publishers 
are holding a conference on homosexual literature to declare their 
creativity is far from being silenced 
jeffrey escoffier copublisher of the san franciscobased 
literary magazine sponsoring the weekend convention said 1200 
writers publishers and agents had signed up 
allen ginsberg a counterculture poet of the beat and hippie 
movements of the 1950s and 1960s was the scheduled keynote 
speaker his publisher lawrence ferlinghetti was acquitted on 
pornography charges filed in connection with publication of 
ginsbergs howl and other poems in 1956 
the number of people registered for the conference showed that 
gay and lesbian creativity is far from being silenced 
escoffier said 
the power of what we have to say will drown out jesse helms 
and other conservatives no matter how much they try to silence 
us escoffier said 
the north carolina republican us senator was the driving force 
behind the national endowment for the arts censorship last summer 
of institutions exhibiting work of the late erotic photographer 
robert mapplethorpe 
the nea has said winners of its 1990 fellowships cant use 
federal funds to depict among other things homoeroticism a 
trademark of mapplethorpes work 
jack fritscher a writer and friend of mapplethorpes contends 
that wouldbe censors want to silence people who believe in their 
own sexuality by promoting scare tactics to convince young people 
that if you do it have sex youll get aids do it and youll 
die do it and youll get pregnant 
fritscher author of the justreleased novel some danced to 
remember about gay lifestyles in the preaids golden age of 
the 1970s also runs an adult video business north of san 
francisco 
but he said that 17 states wont allow him to ship the videos 
that include advice on safe sex because of moral fervor that 
boils over in an attempt to clean up society in general 
fritscher who has a phd in american literature said he 
believes in parental influence to protect children from 
sexuallyexplicit materials they cant understand while allowing 
adults freedom to chose 
if you cant burn the flag theres no point in waving it 
he said and that taken as a metaphor fits the whole 
situation 
in addition to censorship and politics the conference at the 
cathedral hill hotel will examine such issues as responsibility of 
authors to deal with aids in their writings the role of gay 
journalism gay writers and the mainstream and gay magazines 
mysteries science fiction poetry and history 
mexican playwright juanjacobo hernandez founder of the first 
latin american gay publishing house will moderate a panel 
discussion on gay literature in the mexican hispanic and puerto 
rican cultures 
joining him will be santa cruz calif teacher francisco x 
alarcon whose poetry collection body in flames is billed as

a high school disturbance in which eight people 
were slightly injured and nine students arrested was not divided 
along racial lines said the principal whose firing helped provoke 
the incident 
police clashed with hundreds of students at morgan park high 
school on thursday in a confrontation that began when the school 
fire alarm was pulled four times about an hour after a brief 
student protest against the firing of principal walter pilditch by 
a parentled panel 
i had one reporter call and tell me that all kids at the 
demonstration were white and all the kids injured and arrested were 
black pilditch who is white said friday 
thats all false he said there were blacks and latinos 
in the demonstration for me and there were two white students 
arrested and two white students injured 
four of the eight people injured were police officers 
the confrontation was the most violent of several protests in 
recent days against the firing of principals under chicagos new 
school reform program 
councils elected for each of chicagos 540 public schools in 
october have the power to hire and fire principals and a handful 
have done so in recent weeks some of the more controversial 
firings have involved white principals at mostly hispanic schools 
board of education spokesman bob saigh said he didnt know if 
the morgan park incident was racially motivated but it appeared to 
have been triggered by the local councils decision to dismiss 
pilditch when his contract expires in june 
most of morgan parks 1800 students were in school friday and 
there were no incidents pilditch said 
about 60 percent of the students are black 24 percent are 
white 12 percent hispanic and 4 percent asian 
pilditch said about two dozen parents and a dozen ministers came 
to the school friday out of concern for the safety of the students

city prosecutors filed misdemeanor 
charges against a helicopter company accused of violating a city 
ordinance intended to stop aerial spraying of the medflykilling 
pesticide malathion 
six charges were filed thursday against san joaquin helicopters 
inc of delano and company operator james c josephson city 
attorney victor kaleta said 
the charges were the first filed under a new law banning 
nighttime helicopter formations from flying below 700 feet 
six san joaquin helicopters flew over pasadena early feb 22 in 
violation of the law kaleta said 
arraignment was scheduled for march 22 in pasadena municipal 
court the charges each carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail 
and a 1000 fine 
the state hired san joaquin to spray malathion over 400 square 
miles of los angeles and orange counties to fight an infestation of 
the mediterranean fruit fly 
malathion is mixed with corn syrup as bait then sprayed state 
agriculture and health officials contend the spraying is safe 
despite mounting citizen opposition to the nighttime missions 
pasadenas governing board of directors worried about 
malathions possible health risks last month enacted the 
lowflying ban 
but state officials contend an emergency declaration by gov 
george deukmejian supersedes local laws and ordinances including 
pasadenas helicopter ban 
the fly lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits 
vegetables and nuts grown in california rendering the produce 
inedible

state treasurer ann richards told a statewide 
television audience friday night she isnt racially insensitive 
and her two main democratic rivals in the race for governor agreed 
however ms richards opponents used the televised debate to 
highlight her refusal to directly answer questions about whether 
she had ever used illegal drugs 
former gov mark white and attorney general jim mattox repeated 
earlier assertions theyd never used illegal drugs 
when ms richards a recovering alcoholic was asked she 
refused to give a yes or no answer she said i have revealed 
more about my personal life including my alcoholism than any 
other candidate that has ever run for governor 
ms richards whose noholdsbarred oratory during the 1988 
democratic national convention brought wide recognition is 
believed to be trailing white slightly in the race for the 
democratic gubernatorial nomination most polls show mattox well 
behind as the march 13 primary election nears 
the most personal issue in the campaign to date has revolved 
around two remarks attributed to ms richards 
a newspaper report feb 21 said a handwritten text of a 1976 
speech by ms richards who was running for travis county 
commissioner referred to illegal aliens as wetbacks she 
denied using the word in the speech 
earlier she was criticized for a remark during a televised 
debate that many heard as no legislator no judge and no 
bureaucrat has any business in determining whether a white woman 
has an abortion or not 
ms richards insists she said why a woman rather than 
white woman 
in fridays debate ms richards noted she has been active in 
civil rights causes 
white at one point turned to ms richards and said i dont 
think theres a racist bone in your body 
added mattox i dont think youre a racist by any stretch of 
the imagination but mattox criticized mrs richards for moving 
slowly to address the issue and also was critical of her refusal 
to say if she had ever used illegal drugs 
ann mark and i have known you a long time and we understand 
why you dont want to answer the question mattox said 
he said ms richards had ducked the issue on eight occasions 
when reporters asked her about drug abuse and that should she win 
the democratic nomination the republican party would have a heyday 
on the issue 
the four main republican gubernatorial candidates met in a 
similar forum thursday night they are oilman clayton williams 
former texas secretary of state jack rains attorney tom luce and 
railroad commissioner kent hance 
gov bill clements a republican isnt seeking reelection 
candidates with little following or chance to win werent

the state supreme court on friday upheld 
the convictions of two men who got caught with a bag of illegal 
fish then tried to get off the hook by arguing that the game 
wardens roadblock was improper 
gary sherburne and his son donald were nabbed on route 7 in 
corinna in may 1988 with 19 salmon 15 over the limit they were 
convicted in penobscot county superior court and fined 325 each 
the sherburnes challenged the legality of a maine warden service 
roadblock in which authorities stopped motorists and searched the 
belongings of those who acknowledged they had been fishing the 
sherburnes contended on appeal that the fact they had gone fishing 
did not give authorities probable cause for a search 
they called the stop a violation of their constitutional rights 
but the maine supreme judicial court rejected their appeal in a 51 
vote 
justice robert w clifford writing for the majority agreed 
with the trial court that the roadblock was conducted reasonably 
he said the states interest in preserving game and fish outweighed 
the intrusion on motorists who were stopped and fishermen who were 
searched 
the dissent came from justice caroline d glassman who accused 
the majority of a faulty analysis of constitutional law ms 
glassman said catching a few fishing violations did not warrant the 
use of the roadblock 
the sherburnes attorney robert e sandy jr of waterville 
said late friday afternoon that he and his clients accepted the 
courts decision 
we have been given a full and fair hearing before the highest 
court in the state sandy said we lost the decision

it would be a lot easier to understand the state 
of the us economy right now if things like the weather didnt 
keep blurring the picture 
for the past few months nearly all the statistical information 
on economic activity has come out amid a chorus of qualifications 
analysts said the numbers for december showed misleading 
strength in industrial production for example because frigid 
temperatures in much of the country swelled demand for heat and 
electrical power 
in january it was reported retail sales figures were 
artificially inflated by a sudden swing to abovenormal warmth that 
drew shoppers out of their homes 
thus by the time a 11 percent upsurge in the consumer price 
index for january was announced a few weeks ago numerous 
explanations had been prepared to show why it shouldnt worry 
anyone 
if you excluded food and energy costs which are said to be 
especially prone to deceptive shortterm fluctuations the cpi was 
up a less threatening 06 percent 
to those who still found the latter figure disturbing observers 
cited further special influences including an increase in public 
transportation fares in the new york city area 
the idea of screening out supposedly aberrant influences makes 
sense in principle after all analysts who study the numbers are 
looking for trends of lasting significance when you are watching 
for changes in the tide you dont want to be distracted by 
individual waves 
still there may be limits to how many asterisks and footnotes 
an average citizen might accept 
veteran riders of the new york city subways for instance will 
have trouble swallowing the idea that what they encountered at the 
start of 1990 was a onetime fare increase 
twentyfive years ago they recall a trip cost 15 cents now it 
is 115 
similarly consumers might balk at the idea that their actual 
experience with inflation is better portrayed if you dont count 
the cost of feeding their families or driving their cars 
inflation is a general rise in the price level says paul 
boltz financial economist at the investment management firm of t 
rowe price associates it can occur even while prices of some 
goods are falling 
likewise prices of some goods can rise more rapidly than the 
general inflation rate but subtracting them out of the inflation 
measure does not lower inflation 
the idea that the weather has somehow been abornally wild and 
wacky this winter also is suspect true temperatures have 
fluctuated widely day by day and week by week from their historical 
averages but those things tend to even out 
as of early this month cumulative degreeday counts for the 
season in the northeast were running very close to those of last 
winter at the same time and to normal levels calculated by 
meteorologists 
many economic observers hold out the hope that a better fix on 
the economy will be available soon now that winter is almost over 
but evidently those bets are off if we have some sort of 
unusual spring

their currency is named for the sun but with 
inflation of nearly 3000 percent last year peruvians got little 
warmth from it 
the first truck i bought 15 years ago cost me 10 million 
soles now that wont even buy me a pack of cigarettes said 
miguel guzman who owns a trucking company in lima 
guzman quoted prices in the old currency the sol spanish for 
sun 
in 1986 when the sol had fallen to 14000 to the dollar the 
government lopped off three zeros and renamed it the inti sun in 
quechua the indian language spoken by nearly half the population 
four years later a dollar buys 14000 intis which means it 
would buy 14 million soles if they were still around 
to peruvians like nearly everyone else jokes are spiritual 
life preservers against disaster the latest one in lima is that 
the government will chop off three zeros again and call its money 
the lupaca sun in aymara perus second major indian language 
the inflation rate for the past year which meant prices ended 
the year 30 times higher on average than 12 months earlier was 
surpassed only by argentinas 4924 percent 
doris mandujano 27 one of three daughters in a workingclass

its bread and oatmeal weve given up trying to provide clothing 
and medicine for everyone 
her family is squeezed into a threebedroom cementblock house 
miss mandujanos father built in villa el salvador a shantytown on 
the outskirts of lima 
miss mandujanos parents and seven of the children including 
herself have jobs and contribute to meeting the familys needs 
she has the additional job of trying to make and follow a budget 
our pay doesnt keep up with prices she said sometimes 
by the fourth day of the month weve already spent what was 
budgeted for two weeks and so the crisis begins 
most economists blame government policies that favored 
consumption over production while creating a huge deficit that fed 
inflation 
they say populist president alan garcias administration has 
subsidized basic goods and services to the point of bankrupting the 
very state companies that provide the services 
a gallon of gasoline costs the equivalent of only 40 cents but 
the state oil company petroperu is on the verge of bankruptcy 
electricity and water are among the worlds cheapest but both 
are rationed to limas 7 milliion people largely because of the 
dilapidated systems some parts of the city have been without water 
for weeks 
ernesto amans president of the state water company said nearly 
half the water leaving treatment plants was lost through leaking 
underground mains and the company could not afford the 18 million 
needed for repairs 
while subsidized prices remain low food and clothing rose more 
than 2500 percent last year entertainment soared more than 10000 
percent and education nearly 20000 percent according to official 
statistics 
the magazine analisis laboral predicts that by the time garcia 
leaves office july 28 accumulated inflation during his fiveyear 
term will reach 1383120 percent 
novelist mario vargas llosa is favored to win the april 8 
presidential election as the candidate of a centerright coalition 
he has pledged to reduce annual inflation to 10 percent within a 
year but says it will demand great sacrifice 
after five years of garcia who campaigned as the president of 
hope and won by a landslide many peruvians are skeptical of 
politicians promises 
all thats left to believe in is ourselves miss mandujano

each year manufacturers belch thousands 
of tons of chemicals into the stratosphere eating the fragile 
ozone layer that protects the earth against the suns damaging 
ultraviolet rays 
until last year the clear skies over ibms circuit board plant 
in endicott in southcentral new york belied the plants identity 
as one of the largest users of ozonedepleting chemicals in the 
united states releasing more than 2 million pounds of the 
invisible chemicals annually from its white steel pipes 
but in january international business machines corp announced 
that after spending millions of dollars and years of research the 
plants emissions of ozonedepleting chemicals had been reduced 
almost 75 percent 
in the face of growing evidence that industrial chemicals are 
eroding the ozone that filters ultraviolet rays ibm is one of a 
number of american companies slowly beginning to change the way 
they do business 
the destructive effects on the ozone caused by 
chlorofluorocarbons used as refrigerants cleaning solvents and to 
make bubbles in plastic foam have been known for more than a 
decade 
the environmental protection agency has ordered a 50 percent 
reduction in the use of cfcs by the end of the century and many 
companies have set earlier deadlines or pledged to phase them out 
altogether 
but according to the national resources defense council 
emissions of two chemicals that are as yet unregulated methyl 
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride together account for 33 
percent of the manmade ozonedestroying chlorine in the 
stratosphere 
as long as they are used the ozone will be unable to recover 
even if cfcs are phased out entirely the washingtonbased 
environmental interest group says 
spokeswoman deborah sheiman said the group is particularly 
concerned about methyl chloroform a chemical used primarily as a 
metal cleaner and degreaser which has not been widely acknowledged 
as a threat to the ozone 
most of the attention has been on the cfcs sheiman said 
were hoping to turn that around we believe that methyl 
chloroform has got to be controlled if were going to repair the 
damage to the ozone hole 
although about 200 companies reported reduced methyl chloroform 
emissions in 1988 the latest year for which figures are available 
almost as many increased emissions sheiman said 
at ibms vast 88building complex in endicott the company uses 
methyl chloroform in production of computer circuit boards 
in 1987 and 1988 the plant emitted more than 1 million pounds 
of methyl chloroform about 2 percent of the total amount of the 
chemical used at the plant environmental engineering manager 
dennis f whittaker said 
last year ibm substituted a waterbased solvent for methyl 
chloroform in one production line resulting in an 89 percent 
reduction in methyl chloroform emissions down to 121000 pounds 
whittaker said 
the new process which ibm is implementing at plants in texas 
japan and west germany was developed after more than five years 
collaboration between ibm engineers and suppliers whittaker said 
he estimated the cost of research development and engineering 
changes at about 40 million 
it takes a long time and its a tremendous investment he 
said its not something you do to improve your profit line 
methyl chloroform still is used in the companys advanced 
technology line where more complex boards for mainframe computers 
are produced ibm has not found a substitute precise enough to use 
in that process whittaker said 
were working on it he said we need a breakthrough its 
hard to schedule an invention 
pratt amp whitney of east hartford conn reported the highest 
methyl chloroform emissions in the country in 1987 the aircraft 
engine manufacturer has committed to reducing those levels by 80 
percent to 90 percent in the next four years by switching to 
alkaline cleaners spokeswoman peggy kay said 
the companys emissions already dropped by more than 75 percent 
in 1988 she said 
but kay said it takes years of testing to ensure that changes 
made in the companys manufacturing processes do not hurt the 
product 
you have to make sure that youre producing the same 
quality she said if not then its not worth it you want 
safe aircraft engines 
companies switching to environmentally safer alternatives find 
they do not always work as well as methyl chloroform 
the johnson controls plant in watertown wis has replaced 
methyl chloroform with a petroleumbased solvent plant engineer 
russell miller said 
ive gotten lots of complaints he said methyl chloroform 
is a very good solvent but its very environmentally wrong he 
said 
at the fischer controls international plant in marshalltown 
iowa alkaline washers are replacing methyl chloroform as a 
degreaser said ron allen the plants director of loss prevention 
the new washers are more expensive and difficult to use but 
much friendlier to the environment allen said 
we are optimistic that we can make alkaline washers work as 
well he said we have a strong formal commitment to the 
environment and we feel we need to be pacesetters for our 
customers 
the national resources defense council wants to see laws banning 
the use of methyl chloroform but in the meantime public pressure 
is pushing some companies to begin voluntarily reducing emissions 
of ozonedepleting chemicals sheiman said 
i think its having an impact she said that so many 
companies have come forth with these pledges it certainly has 
seemed to resonate in corporate boardrooms

like many residents auto parts dealer 
jose chavez has developed a fear of teenagers in his crimeplagued 
colonia near the south texas border 
his advice for visitors if you stop there at nighttime and 
you see a bunch of kids you better not stop 
they might be tricity bombers a youth gang claiming lopezville 
as its territory other gangs roam many of hidalgo countys rural 
colonias the scores of impoverished subdivisions where migrant 
farm workers live along unpaved streets without adequate water 
sewers or drainage 
in this farming region separated from the rest of the country by 
huge ranches people wonder how they ended up with a social problem 
considered symptomatic of bigcity angst and alienation 
how did they get an asphalt jungle in a place where the 
streets arent even paved 
officials say the lower rio grande valleys gangs remain 
relatively unsophisticated yet just as in los angeles chicago 
and other cities they steal fight and attack enemies windows 
with rocks and bullets 
sometimes they kill in january a gunfight between what police 
said were rival gang members left two young men dead in the town of 
san juan 
it is the despair of poverty some say that leads to gang 
membership along with a high school dropout rate that hovers 
around 50 percent 
kids are real bored man said gabriel benavides a 
17yearold still in school who has been named by the hildago 
county sheriffs department as a tricity bombers leader 
the gang which claims about 200 members is named for the 
cities of pharr san juan and alamo which share a school district 
the spraypainted tcb initials show up everywhere in lopezville 
its like having an outside family were all brothers 
benavides said putting his fist on his heart with the index and 
pinky fingers extended the tcb salute 
they dont like to fight he said but cautioned i have a 
tendency to cause pain if you give me trouble i have a tendency 
to cause pain if you dont mess with me i wont give you pain 
tcb member jorge alberto cantu 20 remains in jail without 
bond accused in the shooting deaths of two males who authorities 
said belonged to a gang called the spoilers tcb members confronted 
a group of spoilers outside a san juan video arcade the night of 
jan 5 said police chief rene lizcano 
parents of the victims 14yearold guadalupe gonzalez jr and 
his 21yearold cousin miguel ojeda said neither belonged to a 
gang 
he was going to get married a week later oralia ojeda said 
of her son 
chavez gave up on keeping glass in the windows at his small 
store joes auto parts gang members would throw rocks through 
them in revenge every time he painted over the graffiti they 
sprayed on his storefront he said now the windows are covered 
with heavy sheets of plywood 
one night a brick sailed through the front window of chavezs 
house and hit his wife in the head he said another day someone 
fired shots into the cab of his truck 
a lot of these people they dont say nothing because theyre 
afraid these kids will come and do something at their house at 
night while theyre asleep chavez said 
two years ago five area gang members were convicted of beating 
a 27yearold man to death with a baseball bat outside a 
convenience store they left his 33yearold brother with permanent 
brain damage said chief deputy bob davis of the sheriffs 
department 
apparently it wasnt over anything davis said these 
guys were on their turf 
davis estimates about 25 gangs operate in the countys rural 
areas covered by only seven patrol cars gang members smashed the 
windows out of four patrol cars in a melee last halloween 
some residents say the gangs have been around for nearly a 
decade but drew authorities attention only after the cars were 
attacked 
the developments worry j michael olivero a criminal justice 
professor at the university of texaspan american in edinburg 
olivero who studied gangs in the chicago area believes the 
south texas groups could become sophisticated crime rings involved 
in extortion drug trafficking and other crimes typical of urban 
gangs 
they found a kid with an uzi olivero said the things 
arent cheap 
graffiti representing california and illinois gangs has started 
appearing on area walls which olivero said could result from 
children of migrant farm families traveling to other states 
community leaders have been meeting recently to address the gang 
problem and say parks and jobs would help kids stay out of trouble 
school officials meanwhile have promised a late afternoon bus 
route to give students in outlying areas a chance to participate in 
extracurricular activities 
chris willingham head counselor at the local high school said 
the transient lives of migrant farm workers keep many children 
offbalance at school many arrive late in the year and leave 
early she said 
were going to have to address the educational needs of these 
kids olivero said and were going to have to get them water 
and get them roads and things like that to facilitate a sense of 
pride kids who are integrated with family church and school dont 
join gangs 
but while lizcano the san juan police chief acknowledges the 
county has a problem he rejects the theory that gangs are fostered 
by poverty and hopelessness 
i grew up in a colonia myself he said and im a chief of 
police

joe cimino and willie hoskins put on 
red union tshirts last march 4 and joined the thousands of 
machinists outside eastern airlines during the first hours of the 
strike against the carrier 
they chanted the same protest cries they rattled the chainlink 
gates near eastern hangars 
today cimino and two other striking eastern machinists are 
building up an automotive repair business hoskins has applied for 
a 5anhour job as a security guard so he can get health insurance 
to pay for dentures 
when we went out on strike its like someone pulled the rug 
out from under you said cimino who pooled 10000 with the 
other workers to open the garage north of miami you can either 
stay down or get up im union all the way but you have to pay the 
bills 
the last day i worked was my last day at eastern said 
hoskins a 34year eastern veteran who lived on his 400amonth 
strike benefits and life insurance money from his late mother 
for many of the 9000 eastern machinists who walked off the job 
with raised fists and high hopes the past year has been a test of 
selfpreservation and a lesson in the squeeze of a slowing national 
economy 
some have found work at other airlines others took jobs where 
they could restaurants factories air freight companies few make 
the 1999 an hour topscale pay they were earning at eastern 
easterns chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing locked up thousands 
of dollars many machinists had saved under a vacationtime 
reimbursement plan health insurance bills keep coming in 
some people have landed on their feet but there have also 
been some real sad stories said machinist union local vice 
president frank ortis who estimates at least a dozen suicides and 
many more divorces have occurred among the union ranks since the 
strike 
wage and work force reductions since the strike at eastern 
once one of floridas largest employers have had at least a 1 
billion economic impact said william o cullom president of the 
greater miami chamber of commerce 
since the strike miamibased eastern has shifted most of its 
hub operations to atlanta miami accounts for less than 50 of the 
total daily flights of 800 airline spokesman robert hunter said 
before the strike eastern ran about 1100 flights a day with 
about 28000 employees now the airline has about 20000 
employees about half hired since the strike started 
very few of the pilots and flight attendants were able to return 
to eastern when they called off their sympathy strike last fall 
but the decline of eastern in miami has been compensated by the 
expansion by other carriers such as american airlines and pan 
american world airways which are battling over easterns latin 
american routes 
for the airport and the community as a whole the strikes 
impact has been small its the individuals that are going through 
hell in some cases said nicholas glaskowsky an economics 
professor at the university of miami 
for the 12000 residents of miami springs near the airport the 
strike has not been the economic menace predicted last spring 
fred white a 24year barber and parttime real estate agent 
said a few eastern workers moved out but their homes quickly were 
purchased by newcomers 
this town no longer lives or dies on what happens at 
eastern he said life goes on 
even at the machinists local headquarters reality is replacing 
rhetoric 
there still are many handwritten placards urging unity and 
attacking frank lorenzo head of eastern airlines parent texas 
air corp but most attention goes to reports of job openings some 
as away far as los angeles denver and honolulu 
you cant be unrealistic and believe that people arent going 
to take a job if they need it and leave town said ortis 
last month while in miami aflcio president lane kirkland said 
there were no victors in the eastern strike since labor has not 
forced the sale of the carrier and management still is burdened by 
losses last year texas air reported a loss of 8856 million the 
largest ever by a us airline 
but few strikers express regrets saying the strike has 
strengthened the organized labor movement 
we all knew what we were walking away from when we left 
eastern security and good pay for good or bad thousands of lives 
were affected by that decision im still convinced it was the 
right one said bob young a partner with cimino and striker 
frank weiss at the pembroke pines automotive shop 
last month striker vincent parlatore had his day in court a 
smallclaims court judge however rejected his claim for 1580 in 
back wages 
it was another disappointment in a belttightening year 
parlatore peddled telephone books shortly after the strike and got 
extra hours as a policeman in a seaside town near fort lauderdale 
his pay at an air cargo company in miami is 1325 an hour 
about twothirds what he made at eastern 
were not out begging but lifes not as easy as it was 
parlatore said if its not a necessity we dont buy it we 
dont go out to eat we cant go to movies 
parlatore has applied for an inspectors job with the federal 
aviation administration if hired he might be forced to move 
what can you do he said thats one less person on the 
picket line

the chaotic development that is gobbling up the 
amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan 
developed by officials of amazon countries and leading scientists 
from around the world 
thats some of the most encouraging news about the amazon rain 
forest in recent years said thomas lovejoy a tropical ecologist 
at the smithsonian institution and an amazon specialist 
it contrasts markedly with a year ago when there was nothing 
to read about conservation in the amazon especially in brazil 
except bad news lovejoy said in a recent interview 
sixty percent of the amazon the worlds largest tropical rain 
forest lies in brazil but the forest also covers parts of eight 
surrounding countries 
lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in 
midjanuary in manaus brazil a sprawling city of 1 million people 
in the heart of the amazon it was the center of brazils 
oncethriving rubber trade 
the workshop which brought together all the governments and 
scientists with interests in the rain forest culminated with a 
plan to regulate development in up to 80 percent of the amazon 
region 
it was the first time that all parties concerned with the amazon 
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation 
priorities the meetings participants said 
the plan devised at the workshop has no legal force but it has 
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for 
national conservation programs participants said 
many of the areas to be preserved will be open to socalled 
multipleuse development which preserves the forest while allowing 
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers fruits and 
medicinal plants 
brazil struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by 
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle 
ranching or farming has been ambivalent about the need to conserve 
the amazon 
brazil participated in the manaus workshop however and the 
setting of priorities was all done with the blessing of brazil 
lovejoy said 
tropical rain forests are giant living warehouses for thousands 
of plant and animal species the amazon alone is home to 30 percent 
of the worlds plant and animal species 
one study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken 
from the deep shadows of the amazon floor contained 800 ants 
representing 50 species 
towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor 
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives 
without ever setting foot on the ground one group of orchid 
species grows only near the top of the canopy an entirely 
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom 
at the manaus meeting more than 100 specialists met in small 
groups to assess conservation priorities 
insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the 
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators 
mammologists took inventory of the amazons screeching monkeys 
ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats 
fallen fruits and nuts on the amazon rivers banks when it 
overflows botanists ornithologists and others did the same 
then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the 
amazon when they were done the areas determined to be worth 
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the amazon 
the bulk of the amazon is a biological priority theres no 
way of getting around that said russell mittermeier president 
of conservation international and an authority on endangered 
monkeys 
mittermeier emphasized however that the plan set realistic 
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves along 
with multipleuse areas where some development could occur 
it is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80 
percent of the amazon he said only the most critical areas should 
be placed off limits to development 
ten to 20 percent of the entire amazon should be in protected 
parks or preserves ideally he said at present 2 percent of 
the amazon is protected 
brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan 
the results of this meeting are a major contribution towards 
the work that has got to be done said stanley malone director 
of the suriname forest service 
suriname was one of eight amazon countries that agreed in 1978 
to develop a unified approach to management of the amazon malone 
said what the officials lacked however was a guide to which 
areas most needed protection 
that determination has now been made based on the number of 
different species a given area contained and on how many of those 
species were endemic or unique to the area 
now well have to see what develops from this mittermeier 
said a new brazilian president fernando collor de mello will be 
inaugurated march 15 and with him will come a new brazilian 
environmental policy 
whether the policy will include support for the manaus plan is 
uncertain as always everything depends on key individuals 
mittermeier said 
im basically always optimistic he said i feel sure that 
we can develop appropriate solutions although it may take a lot of 
work

the 1990 audi v8 quattro is as close to a swagger as the folks 
at audi get 
this 47450 power machine is quietly packaged in decidedly audi 
styling the luxury eurosedan look thats relatively unassuming 
but take this new flagship of the audi fleet out on the highway 
and revel with audi in a new appreciation for what a luxury 
eurosedan can be 
the audi v8 quattro test cars 36liter 32valve v8 engine 
impressively dominated going from 0 to 60 mph in 87 seconds and 
is capable of producing 240 horsepower coupled with fourspeed 
electronically controlled automatic transmission it delivered 
smooth performance especially in the economy driving mode 
drivers can change the shift points with a knob on the center 
console depending on whether they want to watch fuel consumption 
economy mode or want maximum power sport setting i preferred 
the sport setting though it made this nearly 4000pound car so 
quick i nearly took off the corner bumpers of a couple of cars i 
was trying to pass 
and road handling the audi v8s suspension was masterful 
making the vehicle feel as safe and in control at lets just say 
frightfully high speeds as it did at the highway speed limit of 65 
mph and with fulltime fourwheeldrive this car can handle just 
about anything it tackled snow with gusto leaving other cars in a 
swirl of white it tracked capably through icy slush too 
it was especially impressive considering this is audis first 
merging of a powerful 32valve v8 engine an automatic 
transmission and permanent allwheeldrive technology of course 
its also the most expensive car the west german carmaker has 
marketed in the states the previous toppriced audi was the 200 
quattro wagon at 38000 
but wait theres more to the audi v8 quattro a microcomputer 
not only monitors the engine systems and maintains optimum 
performance but memorizes malfunctions for easier diagnosis at the 
shop 
the test cars antilock brakes abs came with a turnoff button 
on the dashboard for those driving conditions such as loose 
gravel where abs can sometimes hinder a drivers ability to stop 
by preventing gravel from building up at the wheels 
the audi bose sound system was superb and the electronically 
controlled front seats leather of course were roomy and 
comfortable the front center armrest which housed a cellular 
phone that was standard equipment not optional could be adjusted 
to various heights 
other thoughtful touches included heated seats in both the front 
and rear that worked wonderfully fast a heated door lock on the 
driver door so you cant be frozen out of the car and a dual 
windshield washer system the system lets you use a special washer 
fluid thats particularly effective for salt and grime first and 
then follow up with the regular fluid for pictureperfect vision no 
matter what the road throws up at you the headlights received a 
washing too each time the regular washer fluid was activated 
the front floor mats had fasteners to keep them in place 
carpeting was allwool throughout and the shoulder belt height was 
adjustable so the belt wouldnt chafe against a short persons neck 
there also was a reddish light that shone down on the driver 
floor area as an added safety feature when the headlights were on 
wood grain tastefully swathed across the doors and dashboard and a 
spot in the center of the instrument cluster that showed what radio 
station was tuned in so the driver never had to look below at the 
radio 
that feature took some getting used to my eyes caught the 
flickering of something changing in the instrument cluster and at 
first i thought it must have been a warning light that came on and 
went out on examination i realized it was just the changing radio 
station 
i also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel i averaged under 
17 mpg in combined cityhighway driving with the epa rating the 
audi v8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway a gas 
guzzler tax of 1050 by the way is added on to the 47450 base 
price for the audi v8 quattro because of the vehicles poor fuel 
economy 
additionally the person sitting in the rear middle seat would 
find the seatback a bit hard thats where the rear center armrest 
is and it just doesnt make for a very comfortable longterm 
resting spot on the other hand the rear legroom was good and 
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be 
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children 
in back cant get hurt 
audi lists some impressive competitors for the v8 quattro the 
mercedesbenz 420sel which starts around 63000 the bmw 735i 
around 53000 and the jaguar xj6 vanden plas around 48000 
audi didnt mention japanese luxury models such as the lexus 
ls400 which starts at 35000 but theyre bound to be a factor 
too 
still sales of the audi v8 quattro totaled more than 800 in 
calendar 1989 and the company projects about 1500 sales in 1990 
theyre looking for mostly male buyers between 35 and 49 with 
household income of 150000 they will be predominantly college 
graduates in professional jobs audi said 
because the audi v8 quattro is a new vehicle consumer reports 
magazine does not list owner trouble reports

nordstrom inc put on a pedestal for delivering 
extraordinary service at its department stores may have had an 
unfair advantage over the rivals that have long looked up to the 
retailer 
some of the smiling salesmen and women known for writing 
personal thankyou notes to customers and going to unusual lengths 
to satisfy shoppers apparently have been scowling inside outsiders 
who saw a happy family of nordies now are learning they may 
have gotten the wrong impression 
the seattlebased department store owner virtually admitted this 
past week that employees hadnt been fully paid for providing the 
impeccable service that has made nordstrom famous 
the company said it created a 15 million reserve for backpay 
claims a provision that eroded fourthquarter earnings 
for the quarter ended jan 31 earnings tumbled 34 percent to 
314 million or 39 cents a share from 475 million or 58 cents a 
share a year earlier sales rose 12 percent to 8575 million in 
the quarter from 7651 million 
much of the drop in quarterly earnings reflected higher 
merchandise markdowns to keep up with pricecutting competitors 
accusations have come to light that nordstrom pressures its 
employees into performing tasks on their own time 
the washington state department of labor and industry ruled last 
month that nordstrom had a pattern of making sales clerks work 
during offhours without compensation and ordered the company to 
pay them for uncompensated hours employees sometimes bring 
merchandise to customers homes thank them in writing for shopping 
at nordstrom and do other good retailing deeds 
making matters worse nordstrom has been hit with two 
classaction lawsuits one filed by three shareholders claiming 
they and others who own company stock suffered financial losses 
because nordstrom officers failed to disclose the labor problems 
kurt barnard a new yorkbased retail consultant says now that 
nordstroms dark secret is attracting national attention 
competitors may feel less inclined to emulate the company 
by not paying fully for the work it got out of employees a 
company its competitors considered the epitome of retailing 
excellence actually had an unfair advantage 
their competitors have been under tremendous pressure to 
render the kind of service that nordstrom has been so famous for 
he said the question now arises will they be able to render the 
same type of service if they have to pay for it will other stores 
still be so eager to follow suit 
even before nordstroms dirty laundry began being aired in 
public the companys stock had been taking a beating the stock 
40 percent owned by the founding nordstrom family has slumped 
about 35 percent since reaching a high of 4250 a share over the 
summer it was trading around 27 last week 
some analysts poohpooh the idea that the bad publicity over 
nordstroms labor practices will cause lasting damage to a stock 
with heaps of potential 
richard pyle of the investment firm piper jaffray amp hopwood 
inc says now is an ideal time to invest in nordstrom 
were comfortable recommending the stock as a buy for people 
looking to own a longterm growth company pyle said the only 
time you get to buy this company cheaply is when its in the midst 
of a minicrisis 
a severe case of inventory bloat in 1984 and the stock market 
crash in october 1987 provided two earlier buying opportunities he 
said 
the traits that he admires in nordstrom havent been altered 
the company is a savvy fashion merchandiser and produces sales of 
more than 400 a square foot roughly double the volume of its 
competitors 
pyle predicts the labor issue will be resolved satisfactorily 
in any case not all nordies are negative on the company as a 
support rally at the companys flagship seattle store last thursday 
attested 
nordstrom has 60 stores in washington oregon california 
alaska virginia and utah it plans 16 more with expansion into 
illinois new jersey maryland minnesota indiana connecticut 
massachusetts and new york 
there are a lot of employees out there who are supportive of 
how nordstrom runs its business said pyle adding that there are 
plenty of real estate developers all over the country with space on 
their hands who would love to fill it with a nordstrom store

despite all the dark forecasts that surging 
interest rates in japan and west germany will drive us rates up 
american corporations dependent on borrowed money show little sign 
of worry 
indeed if their propensity to borrow is a good indicator it 
appears that many companies regard the recent upturn in us rates 
to be temporary and not the beginning of an upward worldwide spiral 
that would be good news for the credit markets which have been 
gripped in recent weeks by fears about foreign demand for us 
treasury bonds and the sorry state of the junk bond market 
in the first two months of this year borrowers issued a total 
of 97 billion in investmentgrade bonds in the public market 
according to moodys investors service that amounts to an 
annualized rate of just under 60 billion a drop of more than 22 
percent from the 1989 total of 778 billion 
whats more this years total has been inflated by more issues 
from foreign borrowers such as the canadian province of nova 
scotia which offered 300 million of 30year bonds this past week 
the surprising upturn in longterm bond yields in early 1990 
definitely has discouraged a significant amount of investmentgrade 
corporate bond issuance says john lonski senior economist at 
moodys 
many a corporate treasurer perhaps still expects longterm 
bond yields to decline later in the year he said 
while corporations have been abstaining from the bond market 
they have been actively peddling ious in shortterm markets where 
rates havent risen as much the total amount of commercial paper 
outstanding issued by nonfinancial companies was 1365 billion as 
of feb 21 a jump of 831 billion since the start of the year 
seth waugh managing director in charge of corporate bond 
trading and new issues at merrill lynch amp co said most wall 
street bankers had thought rates would stay low and bond business 
would boom in the first quarter 
instead rates have risen because of a spurt in inflation a 
belief that the economy is on the mend and fears of more intense 
competition for global investment funds from japan and west germany 
the yield on the treasurys benchmark 30year bond has risen 
from a december low of near 78 percent to around 86 percent 
currently 
waugh says a pickup in new issues in the past two weeks shows 
some corporations want to lock in current rates to guard against an 
increase even though many others are content to wait a 
quarterpoint move in interest rates would produce a rush of 
borrowings he predicts motivated by fear if rates go up or by the 
cheaper cost of funds if rates go down 
its a pretty divided camp right now he says 
analysts say its far too soon to read anything deeper into the 
decline in borrowings nevertheless lonski says there are several 
reasons to suspect that corporate activity might stay subdued 
the sluggish economy has slowed growth in capital spending 
reducing companies borrowing needs he says also the collapse of 
the junk bond market as a source of takeover financing has taken 
some pressure off corporate managers he says 
there is less of a need to leverage the balance sheet in order 
to boost your stock price he says 
if thats true it would mark a stark change from the debthappy 
1980s moodys estimates net interest costs amounted to 42 percent 
of operating earnings for nonfinancial companies in last years 
third quarter up from 35 percent in 1988 and an average of 20 
percent from 1972 to 1982 
the rise in debt service largely reflected the explosive growth

bulls took the drivers seat on wall street this 
past week despite a shaky tokyo market and a slew of divergent 
economic signals 
tokyos problems actually helped improve the attitude toward 
us stocks while investors decided americas economic pluses now 
outweigh the minuses 
were not quite as bad as we had been viewed six months ago 
at the same time things arent quite as good everywhere else 
said thomas czech chairman of the investment committee at blunt 
ellis amp loewi inc in milwaukee 
everywhere else mainly means japan the tokyo stock markethas 
been on a slide which intensifed monday with its secondlargest 
point loss ever a 45 percent drop extended the fall in the nikkei 
average of 225 japanese stocks to around 14 percent since the start 
of the year 
to foreigners who for a long time have suspiciously eyed tokyos 
high priceearnings ratios the downturn came as no surprise 
some ratios of stock prices to company earnings there had 
reached as high as 60 to 1 making japanese stocks seem wildly 
overvalued to buttoneddown us investors accustomed to far more 
conservative readings here 
at least some of the money that has flowed out of japanese 
stocks has found a home in the united states 
hugh johnson senior vice president and chief investment officer 
at first albany corp in albany ny said anecdotal evidence 
based on discussions with colleagues in the investment community 
suggests that us investors have been pulling out of japan to 
some extent similar maneuvers are being carried out by japanese 
and west german money managers 
this is the equity markets version of a flight to safety 
the safety of lower priceearnings ratios from the exposure of high 
priceearnings ratios he said 
an indication that more capital is flowing in our direction was 
that the dollar took flight on friday prompting various central 
banks to sell dollars on world foreignexchange markets to check 
the currencys runup 
the us role as a safe haven was enhanced by reports that on 
balance implied the economy might be doing better than some 
gloomanddoomers feared 
a february survey of purchasing managers at the nations 
industrial corporations issued thursday showed the slowdown in 
the manufacturing sector eased the national association of 
purchasing managements widely watched index rose to 483 percent 
in february from 452 percent a month earlier 
a reading below 50 means manufacturing is declining but the 
improvement from january was nonetheless encouraging 
on friday the index of leading economic indicators designed to 
foretell economic activity six to nine months ahead showed no 
change in january the flat reading followed two months of 
increase but seemed to support the view that were in a noboom 
nobust trajectory johnson of first albany said 
the message of the financial markets today is that we will 
miss a recession the analyst said 
news on the leading indicators helped the stock market rally 
friday to extend its winning streak to five straight sessions 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed at 
266036 climbing 2477 on friday which brought its gain for the 
week to 9617 points 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 562 to 
18497 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 1150 to 43102 and the american stock exchanges market 
value index rose 502 to 35612 
big board volume averaged 1616 million shares a day up from 
15984 million daily in the prior week

an alderman is proposing an ordinance that would 
allow the city to use its power of eminent domain to prevent the 
shutdown of local manufacturing plants acquired in takeovers 
the proposed law forcing businesses to sell under city order 
would be the first of its kind in the nation although critics say 
it would amount to unconstitutional nationalization of 
companies 
what we trying to do is focus on corporate raiders buying 
plants on the edge of going under alderman bernard hansen said 
friday they say they are going to improve the plant and keep it 
going but instead they close them and take jobs to another 
country 
hansen said the proposed ordinance would protect jobs by giving 
chicagos economic development commissioner the right to invoke 
eminent domain against the owner of a manufacturing plant that is 
shutting down 
laws of eminent domain allow governments to seize property in 
matters of public interest 
under the proposed ordinance the city could force the sale of 
the seized plant if a buyer had been found to keep the plant open 
for business the ordinance would apply to plants closing within 
five years of takeover by a new owner 
the proposal was drafted by a group called business and 
professional people for the public interest on behalf of workers 
and community groups fighting to keep open a plant operated by 
stewartwarner corp 
the company which makes electronics equipment was purchased by 
britains btr plc which last year announced plans to shutter the 
plant in 1991 and move manufacturing operations to mexico 
hansen said there are potential buyers for the plant but that 
btr refuses to sell 
but critics say the ordinance would allow unwelcome intrusions 
by the city into corporate affairs 
this is a city equivalent of nationalizing a company said 
sam mitchell executive director of the chicago association of 
commerce and industry 
i can understand motivation of the ordinance to keep jobs in 
the city but i dont believe the city or any unit of government 
have the right to step into and effectively nationalize a company 
because they do something that doesnt please that government 
hansen who heads the chicago city councils ecomonic 
development committee said a hearing on the proposed ordinance is 
scheduled for later this month 
lester w brann president of the illinois state chamber of 
commerce calls the proposed ordinance a screwy idea 
the marketplace is going to determine where companies locate 
and where they expand their plants he said they are going to 
expand where the governments operate efficently where incentives 
are offered and taxes are low 
brann said the proposed ordinance could impose a new burden on 
taxpayers and said companies taken over by the city could run into 
problems before a new buyer is found 
the city council would be well advised to take a good hard 
look at what the city is or isnt doing to encourage business 
expansion he said adding that the proposal could be an 
unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce

a few days after his death flamboyant 
publishing tycoon malcom s forbes is gracing the cover of the 
biweekly magazine bearing his name 
the cover of the march 19 issue due on newsstands monday is 
taken from a portrait painted about 10 years ago of forbes wearing 
a silver motorcycling jumpsuit seated in a chair with several 
helmets at his feet 
forbes died of a heart attack last weekend at age 70 
motorcycling was one of forbes passions along with hot air 
ballooning and collecting faberge eggs and toy soldiers several 
hells angels cyclists showed up for a memorial service for forbes 
held thursday in new york 
the painting used for the cover by claudio bravo hangs in the 
lobby of the forbes office building in midtown manhattan 
at the top of the magazines cover is the phrase 19191990 
while alive he lived which will be inscribed on forbes 
tombstone forbes had directed that his body be cremated and the 
ashes interred on lauthala his island in the south pacific 
ten of the 212 pages in the latest issue of the magazine are 
devoted to tributes to the unabashed capitalist 
forbes editor james w michaels said it wasnt terribly 
difficult to redo the issue after forbes sudden death last 
saturday 
we always keep a large bank of pages open til the last minute 
anyhow he said friday its the type of thing that one could 
do with any big story 
still michaels conceded the lastminute changes meant printers 
had to be paid overtime and the issue closed a few hours late it 
was finished around 5 am wednesday rather than around midnight as 
usual 
forbes oldest son malcolm s forbes jr known as steve who 
has taken over as chairman and chief executive of the magazine and 
the familyowned company and as editor in chief of forbes says in 
a message to readers 
there is no replacing my father but i bring the same spirit 
of dedication and joy to the job that he did we will continue to 
move ahead as he was doing 
the fact and comment section where the elder forbes used to 
display his wit and breezy writing style also was written in the 
latest issue by son steve the tribute to his father is entitled 
a matchless man 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger the magazines 
publisher also weighs in with a eulogy there also is a spread of 
photographs including blackandwhite shots of forbes family 
dating to around 1930 
it is a family company and the owner was just down the hall 
michaels said there arent many such publications left in the 
world 
the editor wouldnt disclose what was swept off the cover by the 
portrait of forbes we may use that story in the next issue he 
said

france will grant special visas to hong kong 
citizens working for french companies after the british colony 
reverts to chinese control in 1997 a government spokesman said 
friday 
if they have a valid passport well give them a visa said 
the spokesman who asked not to be named 
he said specific terms of the visas such as length working 
rights and the possibility of permanent immigration had not been 
decided the spokesman said the decision was not officials but was 
agreed to in principal by a government committee 
french enterprises in hong kong have asked president francois 
mitterrands government to act amid growing fear among their 
employees over the pending takeover by beijing the spokesman said 
about 1000 people mostly in management would be eligible for 
the visas the spokesman said he did not specify whether the 
figure would include families 
chinese authorities would have to agree to let them leave the 
spokesman said but the visas should reassure the employees that 
they would have a right to come to france 
british prime minister margaret thatcher has been embroiled in a 
dispute with the colonys population over rights to settle in 
britain after hong kong comes under chinese control 
last years bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in 
china rattled nerves of hong kong residents over what their future 
might be like under a government headed by hardline communists 
britain has said it would allow certain managers and 
entrepreneurs immigration rights but that most of the colonys 5 
million chinese residents would have to stay in hong kong 
british passports carried by the majority of hong kong subjects 
are valid only as travel documents and do not allow them to settle 
britain

when greyhound bus drivers flexed their strike 
muscle and stranded thousands of passengers they didnt read the 
skywriting of eastern airlines another masstransit business hit 
by a mass walkout a year ago 
eastern also was paralyzed for a while but is now flying on a 
smaller scale with replacement workers many strikers are jobless 
the strike forced the airline into bankruptcy court protection but 
eastern expects to exit in months and report a profit in 1990 for 
the first time in years 
if thats a lesson to unions on the futility of striking the 
greyhound drivers who struck the nations only intercity bus system 
this past week evidently didnt learn it 
in some respects the drivers share the same complaints as the 
eastern machinists who struck last march 4 both groups took pay 
cuts in the 1980s a decade of labor givebacks and retreats 
both were dealing with companies purchased by tough business 
executives not known for union sympathy dallas investor fred 
currey who purchased greyhound lines inc for 270 million and 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo who bought eastern for 676 
million 
but many labor experts say thats largely where the similarities 
between the greyhound and eastern strikers end 
some contend the bus drivers had much more leverage than the 
eastern workers partly because greyhound had no other source of 
revenue except the bus line and only began preparing for a strike a 
few weeks ago by training some replacement drivers 
on the other hand lorenzo whose company also operates nonunion 
continental airlines had an enormous advantage in weathering the 
eastern labor confrontation texas air was even accused by a 
bankruptcycourt official this past week of unfairly bleeding 
eastern for continentals benefit the company denied the claim but 
will compensate eastern with more than 280 million 
lorenzo has got the stuff to shuffle around said kim moody 
executive director of the labor education and research project a 
detroitbased group that follows the organized labor movement 
its hard to get a national bus line off the ground in short 
order he said unless theres an awful lot of exbus drivers 
out there these replacement drivers arent qualified you cant 
train people to drive one of these things even halfway safely over 
a couple of weeks 
others said the drivers also had public pressure on their side 
while airline passengers waylaid by the eastern strike eventually 
were able to fly on other carriers bus passengers are hostage to 
what amounts to a greyhound monopoly in 9000 of its 9500 
destinations greyhound is the only bus line 
some groups opposed to mandatory membership in labor unions 
contend the greyhound drivers union has a history of rough tactics 
to get what it wants steve kerekes a spokesman for the national 
right to work committee said while we respect the rights of bus 
drivers to strike one hopes violence wont be used to enforce 
solidarity 
a 1983 study of union violence by the industrial research unit 
of the wharton school suggested the drivers union was more violent 
than many other unions the union claims it does not advocate 
violence 
nonetheless the companys use of replacement drivers was seen 
as helping provoke early violent incidents during the strike 
were about the only country in the civilized world that does 
this sort of thing running a business through a strike elswhere 
the business just shuts down said paul gerhart a professor of 
industrial relations at case western reserve university in 
cleveland 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
government reports provided mixed signals about the economy 
for example sales of new homes fell 71 percent in january to 
their lowest level in nearly a year and durable goods orders 
plunged 105 percent in january suggesting economic weakness 
personal income rose 08 percent in january and 1989 fourthquarter 
gross national product growth was revised upward slightly 
suggesting strength 
wall streets slump deepened shearson lehman hutton inc said 
it would lay off 2000 employees another casualty of the 
securities boom of the 1980s drexel burnham lambert inc faced 
congressional scrutiny into the final weeks before it collapsed 
into bankruptcy last month 
the energy industry got a dose of good news and bad news the 
seabrook nuclear power plant in new hampshire a focal point of 
antinuclear movement protests won full federal licensing 
approval 14 years after construction began exxon corp was 
indicted on criminal charges stemming from the oil spill in valdez 
alaska nearly a year ago and faces fines exceeding 600 million

monday night football games are the latest 
major sports events commanding eyepopping price increases from the 
broadcast and cable networks battling for the rights to televise 
them 
but some advertising agency executives said friday the bidders 
may be overestimating advertisers willingness to help defray the 
costs of the huge television rights contracts 
i hear a lot more reluctance said allen banks media 
director at saatchi amp saatchi dfs advertising inc it raises more 
questions about whether the networks have calculated the 
advertisers mood correctly 
some media industry analysts said the bidders may be willing to 
shoulder a loss on the contracts as an investment in the broader 
welfare of their network the games add to a networks prestige 
attract large numbers of men who often dont watch tv and and 
provide a platform for promoting other programs 
on top of that they note when you have the games your 
competitors dont 
the national football league and capital citiesabc incs abc 
television network announced late thursday they had agreed on a 
fouryear contract reportedly valued at 900 million to broadcast 
monday night games 
that works out to about 225 million a year up 875 percent 
from the 120 million annual average in abcs previous monday night 
football contract 
the increase in the payment per game is somewhat lower however 
because the new package includes 17 monday night games in each of 
the first two years and 18 in the second two years of the contract 
under the old threeyear contract there were only 16 monday night 
games 
in addition abc will be getting the right to broadcast two new 
playoff games that are being added to the schedule this year and 
will get next years super bowl which will be the 25th annual 
championship game 
the nfl still is negotiating over the rights to its sunday 
afternoon games which cbs and nbc broadcast under the previous 
contract 
media analysts said the threat of competition from cable 
networks and outlets such as the fox television network were one 
reason behind the giant leaps made this year in contracts rights 
for football baseball basketball and college football and 
basketball games 
espn was the first cable network to land an nfl contract three 
years ago paying 153 million for the right to 13 games a year 
but the nfl will be getting a reported 900 million from two 
cable networks espn and turner broadcasting systems inc for an 
expanded schedule of sunday night games over the next four years 
unlike the broadcast networks the cable networks can rely on a 
combination of higher ad rates and increased charges to cable 
system operators to help them pay for the sports rights 
steve bornstein executive vice president at espn said he 
expects the network will boost ad rates and operator fees to pay 
for the larger contract but he noted that an increase in 
subscribers who get espn and the addition of a couple 
commercials per game will also boost revenue 
he said espn made a modest profit on its threeyear contract and 
expects to break even on its nfl games over the next four years 
espn felt it had to pay what it did for the contract bornstein 
refused to confirm the reported figure of 450 million because 
turner reached agreement first on telecasting a package of sunday 
night games for a reported 450 million bornstein said 
its an important part of our programming menu he said 
abc refused to make any of its executives available friday to 
discuss how it intends to pay for the sharp increase in the 
football contract 
but lisa donneson media analyst for county natwest usa said 
she figures abc will lose about 7 million during the first year of 
the new monday night contract make a small profit the second year 
and larger profits in the teens and 20s in the last two years 
her estimates assume a singledigit ad rate increase each year 
and higher rates for ads in the new playoff games she noted the 
networks also may add commercial time to their broadcasts to 
generate more revenue 
some analysts said abc could ill afford to lose monday night 
football particularly because cbs outbid it last year for the new 
major league baseball contract 
banks said the broadcasts also give abc an extra way to promote 
other primetime shows as the network tries to overtake the 
primetime ratings leader nbc 
there is a belief that live sports is still very viable 
programming entity that creates a point of difference that nobody 
can copy banks said 
but he noted that with sports proliferating across the 
channel its continued power to draw crowds and willing 
advertisers will be sorely tested

the fate of drexel burnham lambert inc was 
sealed not by 650 million in penalties agreed to pay to settle 
fraud charges but by the firms own investment strategy securities 
and exchange chairman richard c breeden says 
i dont think you can justifiably say that it was the money 
they had to pay in fines breeden told reporters friday after 
testifying before the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee 
breeden also said the sec is investigating the 
multimilliondollar bonuses drexel paid its employees before its 
collapse drexel has said it paid 260 million in bonuses in 
december and january but that the decision to make the payments 
came long before its financial woes became apparent 
on thursday a drexel lawyer told another congressional panel 
that the firm needed to pay big bonuses to retain professionals 
after the bad publicity and uncertainty following the plea bargain 
in december 1988 
if the bonuses were a dodge to reduce drexels assets before 
seeking bankruptcy protection then its possible well take some 
action breeden told the committee 
drexel once the nations fifthlargest securities firm 
collapsed in the wake of a sharp drop in the value of its 
highyield highrisk junk bond portfolio and its admission of 
securities law violations in a plea bargain with federal 
prosecutors 
the parent company sought protection from creditors under the 
federal bankruptcy law feb 13 after defaulting on 100 million in 
shortterm debt and failing to gain new loans to help stem a cash 
crisis 
the sec is seeking bankruptcy court certification as a drexel 
creditor because the firm still owes the government 150 million 
from the settlement while conceding drexel would have been a 
very different company had they not engaged in felony violations of 
us law breeden said the firms fate rested with its 
managements decisions 
drexel still had sizable cash and capital resources after 
pleading guilty to six felony counts and agreeing to the 650 
million settlement he said 
they could have tried to run a smaller firm they were 
unreasonably aggressive in maintaining a 28 billion balance sheet 
with the level of borrowing they had breeden said
