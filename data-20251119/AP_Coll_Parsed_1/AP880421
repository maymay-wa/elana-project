hostages freed in algiers from a hijacked kuwait 
airways jet came home thursday to a tumultuous reception by 
thousands of people after being released by nine shiite moslem 
gunmen who slipped away 
western diplomatic sources said they had clear evidence the 
hijackers had reached beirut after algerian officials allowed them 
to go free ending the 15day siege 
in its friday editions the new york times quoted unnamed arab 
officials as saying the hijackers had been flown on a private 
algerian jet to damascus syria and were believed to have then 
traveled over land to beirut 
the emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and crown 
prince sheik saad abdullah alsabah led a group of government 
officials and relatives who were at the kuwait airport to meet the 
former captives 
flocks of doves soared over the airport as the kuwait airways 
boeing 707 carrying the 22 passengers and seven crew members 
touched down thursday night after a sixhour flight from algiers 
two other hostages released early wednesday were saudi arabian 
citizens and were flown home in a private executive jet 
bedouin men danced and clapped at the kuwaiti airport and 
children waved flags and sang god bless our father jaber 
referring to the emir 
the kuwaiti passengers traveled by motorcade to the city center 
thousands of people lining the route tossing roses and confetti 
hundreds of others followed in cars and limousines honking 
their horns and singing we sacrifice blood and souls for you o 
kuwait 
the gunmen who killed two hostages while the hijacked jumbo jet 
was in cyprus last week disappeared before dawn wednesday after 
abandoning their attempt to force kuwait to release 17 proiranian 
terrorists jailed for bombing the us and french embassies in 
kuwait in 1983 both slain captives were kuwaitis 
kuwait refused any concessions to the hijackers but algeria 
apparently promised them passage to a country of their choice if 
they freed the hostages unharmed 
algeria criticized by the united states and other western 
governments has refused to acknowledge making a deal with the 
hijackers there was no reference to them thursday in any of the 
north african countrys statecontrolled media 
several of the returning kuwaiti passengers accused iran of 
complicity in the hijacking saying one gunman was replaced by two 
others when the craft landed in iran 
one of the two was obviously a military pilot he was ordering 
other gunmen around and telling them lots of things about the 
aircraft and supervising the wiring of explosives to most parts of 
the plane said passenger khaled nasser alzaferi 
in algiers a brief farewell was held at the houari boumedienne 
airport before the former hostages were flown to kuwait 
the former captives included three cousins of sabah jaber sabah 
ruler of the sheikdom 
compared with their tense trembling appearance when they had 
emerged from the hijacked boeing 747 the former captives looked 
rested and relaxed 
anware sabah second cousin of the emir said the hijackers 
treated her and her sister with deference and without 
brutality their brother fadel khaled sabah said he was 
psychologically fatigued when he made a statement by radio to 
the control tower asking that the gunmens demands be met 
after their release the hostages spent 30 hours at the algiers 
military hospital being examined 
a kuwaiti doctor said all were in good physical condition but 
the psychological effects of the long terrifying confinement may 
be felt for weeks or months 
algerian authorities would not permit journalists to inspect the 
hijacked plane which awaited a relief crew to return it to kuwait 
one kuwait airways official said the hijackers deliberately damaged 
the radio equipment before leaving 
a member of the airport cleanup crew said trash was strewn 
through the aircraft ropes had been used to divide the seating 
area and a large world map had been pinned to the wall of the 
forward cabin he said the stench of rotting fruit filled the plane 
other arab countries including kuwait praised algeria for 
achieving freedom for the hostages without additional violence 
algerian media called it a victory but secretary of state 
george p shultz prime minister margaret thatcher of britain and 
other western leaders criticized algeria for allowing the hijackers 
to get away 
the united states will not rest until the terrorists the 
murderers the hijackers are brought to justice said state 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley in washington 
she declined to say what steps might be taken but said officials 
are checking to see whether laws apply that allow charges against 
hijackers when a us citizen is involved at least one passenger 
carried an american passport 
an international convention calls for sanctions against any 
country allowing hijackers to escape unpunished including an end 
to direct air service to the offending nation algeria is not a 
signatory 
an sovietbuilt antonov transport of the algerian air force was 
seen taking off before dawn wednesday shortly before the hostages 
left the hijacked plane it was widely assumed the hijackers were 
aboard the antonov which can land on a grassy field

embattled attorney general edwin meese iii was 
summoned to a private meeting with president reagan at the white 
house on wednesday after reagan met with two justice department 
officials who resigned in protest over meeses continued tenure a 
department source said thursday night 
the source who declined to be identified said deputy attorney 
general arnold burns and former assistant attorney general william 
weld who headed the departments criminal division met at the 
white house with reagan and vice president george bush and some 
white house staff members 
during that 45minute meeting burns told the president bush 
white house chief of staff howard baker and white house counsel 
ab culvahouse that meeses behavior was hurting the department 
of justice another administration source said 
weld meanwhile laid out the facts in a hypothetical 
indictment he said he would have brought against meese if he were 
the special prosecutor investigating the attorney general 
meese has been under investigation for nearly a year by 
independent counsel james mckay who is looking into a handful of 
incidents to see if meese violated conflictofinterest or other 
federal laws 
it was not immediately known what occurred during meeses 
meeting at the white house which immediately followed the 
burnsweld meeting but meese said in an interview thursday with 
usa today that the president has continued to express his total 
support and total confidence 
during the earlier white house meeting with the departing 
justice department officials burns laid out the reasons why 
meese should leave said the source who also spoke on condition 
of anonymity he added that burns never specifically suggested that 
meese should resign 
burns told reagan that meese had violated the standards of 
ethical conduct for executive branch employees spelled out in a 
1965 executive order 
those standards among other things say that employees should 
avoid any action which could create the appearance of using public 
office for private gain giving preferential treatment to any 
organization or person and making a government decision outside 
official channels 
burns specifically mentioned longtime meese friend e robert 
wallach who is under indictment in the wedtech scandal as having 
taken advantage of his relationship with the attorney general to 
promote his own business interests 
burns while not using these specific words in effect told 
reagan that wallach was selling the office of the attorney 
general said the source 
another administration source familiar with the wednesday 
meetings was asked about the outcome as you can see there was 
no change he responded 
a justice department spokesman dean st dennis had no 
immediate comment 
roman popadiuk a white house spokesman said late thursday that 
he was unfamiliar with either of the meetings wednesday 
i have no idea what youre talking about he said i cant 
confirm or deny 
he noted however that white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said this week that reagan has full confidence in meese 
burns and weld have not discussed publicly their reasons for 
submitting their resignations march 29 but sources close to them 
have said they felt that meeses continued tenure in the department 
while he is under investigation by an independent counsel was 
hampering department operations 
during the white house meeting weld told reagan that if he were 
the special prosecutor in the criminal investigation of meese he 
would seek an indictment of the attorney general said the 
administration source 
weld had made similar comments to meese on march 29 when weld 
and burns announced to the attorney general that they were 
resigning 
according to the source weld in the meeting with the president 
laid out the facts in a hypothetical indictment 
the president was very attentive listened to the story got 
up and meese came in after burns and weld left said the 
administration source 
in the past said several sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity weld has told justice department associates that he 
feels a number of felony charges could be lodged against meese 
based on the factual evidence known to date in the nearly yearlong 
probe of meese these include conspiracy counts involving the 
acceptance of illegal gratuities a violation of ethics in 
government act provisions spelling out conflicts of interest and a 
violation of the foreign corrupt practices act barring bribes to 
foreign officials 
one knowledgeable source said that meese had been summoned to 
the white house and met privately with reagan and possibly bush 
after weld had met with meese on the day he resigned 
the source was unable to provide any details of that 
conversation 
mckay is looking into meeses ties to the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project 
mckay is also known to be looking into mrs meeses 
40000ayear job with the multiple sclerosis society mrs 
meeses salary is underwritten by the bender foundation a 
taxexempt philanthropy run by a washington real estate family 
the associated press reported last week that a partnership 
headed by howard m bender the foundations vice president owned 
a building for which the government signed a 50 million lease for 
a justice department office building in may 1987 thirteen days 
after signing the lease the bender partnership sold the building 
for a 226 million profit 
meese has denied any wrongdoing and said he didnt have anything 
to do with the lease 
the attorney general said thursday that he meets the highest 
ethical standards expected of public officials and knows of no 
factor right now that would cause me to resign 
in the interview published in fridays editions of usa today 
meese said the president has continued to express his total 
support and total confidence 
however he did not rule out resigning before reagans term ends 
ive never set a particular limit of how long i would stay or 
how long i wouldnt stay a lot would depend upon my own 
postfederal service employment situation and so on he said

one in an intermittent series of ap candidate closeup stories 
exploring the careers and backgrounds of the remaining presidential 
contenders this story focuses on jesse jacksons record running 
operation push 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i like everything you said the old man told 
jesse jackson on the campaign trail but wont the 
republicans be able to clobber you and the democratic party on the 
basis of your lack of governmental experience 
jackson looked around the hall he was in a new york suburb 
addressing senior citizens who had just listened to a litany of 
legislative accomplishments from sen albert gore jr one of his 
rivals for the presidential nomination 
jackson was ready for this often asked question in the first 
place he said the reaganbush administration has experience and 
look what theyve done a record trade deficit a record debt a 
mess in central america and the middle east and the most sleaze 
and corruption in american history 
then he launched into his own record of leadership in civil 
rights and labor strife 
of those of us who are running if you were about to lose 
your farm had to face the banker which one would you choose to 
argue your case if you needed a scholarship for your child who 
would you want to argue your case if you had a relative in a 
foreign jail who would you send to bring your relative back home 
now the punchline some office holders are not leaders and 
some leaders are not office holders i am a leader 
jackson has never been elected to office or run a business but 
he has headed a nationwide organization the chicagobased 
operation push people united to serve humanity and its 
educationoriented affiliate push for excellence or pushexcel 
his handling of things at push has come under scrutiny for signs of 
how he might run the government 
over the years jackson has used push to keep himself in the 
spotlight with his crowdstirring oratory mediawise instincts and 
ability to capitalize on the latest public issues 
although he stepped down as head of push when he ran for 
president in 1984 he often returns to lead its saturday morning 
meetings 
jackson was the architect of pushs campaign to pressure 
corporations to expand hiring and business opportunities for 
minorities 
however jackson left push with a record of improper use of 
government money high staff turnover and dwindling revenues 
his supporters point to pushs achievements in strengthening 
black economic power as examples of jacksons ability and say he 
was a genius at keeping the organization afloat despite a chronic 
cash shortage 
they dismiss administrative problems as mstakes made by 
wellmeaning volunteers and lowpaid staff members 
i think he managed incredibly well given the resources he had 
all civil rights organizations have always operated at a deficit 
said sam tidmore a founding member of pushs board 
jacksons critics maintain that push operated like a personality 
cult built around jackson rather than a wellmanaged organization 
jesse just doesnt have the ability to keep things together 
said the rev hosea williams a longtime civil rights activist and 
jackson critic when it comes to building and motivating people 
jesse is a genius but he cant sustain an effort and that is 
evidenced by push 
in the past decade push has been beset by troubles 
push for excellence either misspent or failed to account for 
12 million out of an estimated 66 million in federal grants 
from the departments of labor education commerce and health and 
human services federal auditors found the government still is 
trying to collect the money without having to take push to court 
the commerce department concluded in a 1980 audit that 
pushexcels accounting system and internal controls are not 
adequate to safeguard its assets or ensure reliable accounting 
and operating efficiency 
pushexcel and operation push were hit in the 1970s and early 
1980s with more than a dozen lawsuits by businesses seeking payment 
of overdue bills for such things as telephone service printing and 
paper supplies 
in jacksons 1984 campaign it was revealed the push 
organizations had received a 10000 donation from libya and 
200000 from the league of arab states the contributions were 
made after jackson toured the middle east in 1979 and was 
photographed embracing yasser arafat head of the palestine 
liberation organization 
clovis maksoud the arab leagues ambassador to the united 
nations said recently that the contribution was made because of 
a growing affinity between the arabamerican and black 
communities at that time 
maksoud said the arab league has not donated any money since 
then to the push network

on the other side of the ledger push improved business 
opportunities for blacks by persuading corporations to sign 
covenants promising jobs and franchises to minorities often 
after push threatened or carried out boycotts of a companys 
product 
from the start on christmas 1971 jackson vowed the group would 
picket vote and if necessary engage in civil disobedience to 
achieve its goals 
williams now a member of the atlanta city council recalled 
jackson had quit as head of a similar group operation breadbasket 
an arm of the southern christian leadership conference after 
clashing with sclc leaders over expenditures and jacksons 
independent streak 
jackson built push into a network with chapters in 32 cities 
taking in 168 million from 1975 to 1986 the last year for which 
state financial records were filed 
he also used the push platform to take on the administrations of 
several presidents and the city hierarchy of chicago on a range of 
issues from us policy in central america to contracts for 
minorityowned businesses 
pushs saturday meetings are part of chicagos political 
landscape mixing the gospel flavor of a southern church revival 
with jacksons stirring speeches on the days hot issues 
from the push pulpit jackson pressured companies such as 
burger king and cocacola to sign minority opportunity compacts 
jesse was instrumental in making a lot of opportunities 
available by that i mean distributorships getting blacks placed 
in jobs in chain stores said dempsey travis a chicago 
businessman and jackson supporter 
push officials have long been secretive about the groups 
sources of money other than to say it is supported by individual 
memberships that now cost 20 a person and donations from 
businesses 
some of the corporations that signed covenants with push also 
contributed money to help sponsor its annual convention or other 
activities coors brewery for example gave 20000 last year to a 
major push scholarship fundraising event in chicago 
in 1977 jackson broadened pushs mission by starting pushexcel 
to get innercity youths to study harder he spoke in packed school 
gymnasiums nationwide with students joining in his trademark 
chant i am somebody 
after jackson fired up the students pushexcel worked with 
local school officials to set up special clubs and programs to help 
keep the youths motivated 
but federal auditors later contended that government money 
received from 1979 to 1982 went for such layouts as 211 for music 
and flowers for a 1979 press party in los angeles 650 for 
christmas cards purchased for a related organization 28 for 
funeral flowers and 15 for a parking ticket 
the government has referred pushexcels 12 million debt to 
the justice department for collection 
as of now we havent been able to resolve it said justice 
spokesman amy brown 
pushexcel dramatized jacksons strengths and weaknesses said 
ernest house an education professor who has just finished writing 
a book about jackson and the studentmotivation program 
jesse had a lot of very good ideas he has trouble carrying 
them through that has been his problem said house who is 
director of the policy studies laboratory at the university of 
colorado at boulder 
they went through three or four directors one right after the 
other and this was part of his difficulty in administering the 
program house said 
by 1986 pushexcels revenues which peaked at 26 million in 
1980 had dropped to 209071 and the group ended the year with a 
15 million debt including the money owed to the government 
operation push wasnt much better off it started 1986 with a 
339056 deficit but took in enough money to reduce the debt to 
84914 by the end of the year according to its annual report 
filed with the state 
the rev willie barrow pushs national executive director did 
not return repeated telephone calls asking for information about 
the organizations current financial status 
frank watkins jacksons longtime aide and spokesman said he 
understood the group had succeeded this year in nearly erasing its 
deficit 
although jackson was pushs driving force his supporters say he 
shouldnt be blamed for organizational problems in areas delegated 
to subordinates jackson himself has said he didnt get involved in 
mechanical details 
if there was anything sloppy about jesses management it was 
that he could not afford paid competent people to deal with the 
various functions of accounting and management of government 
programs said bishop hh bookins a leader in the african 
methodist episcopal church and a jackson supporter 
jesses main thrust was at raising funds to keep the 
organization afloat so it was impossible for him to be a handson 
manager of things he said 
jackson supporters point to the success of his 1988 presidential 
campaign as evidence he can recruit able people to assist him 
leon davis who worked as pushs national executive director in 
1972 said he sees a different jackson today 
from the time i worked with jesse it seems to me he has grown 
tremendously and his campaign points out one thing he has 
delegated authority

a state senate panel agreed that swing 
is the thing 
sen quentin kopp persuaded the senate rules committee on 
wednesday to approve a bill that would designate the west coast 
swing dance as the official state dance 
kopp said the dance also known as swing whip or jitterbug is 
the only dance native to the state of california that has survived 
it originated in the early 1930s he said adding that devotees 
of the art come from every ethnic religious racial or economic 
background 
the committees 40 vote sent swing over its first legislative 
hurdle it faces further votes in the senate and assembly before it 
would go to the governor for his signature 
the senate several years ago rejected a bill that would have 
made the square dance the official state dance

the senate is likely to join the house in 
approving major changes in the nations welfare system despite the 
near certainty that a presidential veto lies at the end of the long 
road to congressional consensus 
the 25year drive to overhaul welfare took a significant step 
forward wednesday when the senate finance committee voted 173 to 
send a comprehensive reform measure to the floor 
the fiveyear 28 billion family security act reflects a 
hardwon bipartisan consensus that welfare parents should work to 
support their children that the goverment should help make this 
possible and that government aid should be a last resort 
the bill was shaped during months of negotiations and had 
garnered 56 cosponsors by the time the committee acted most of 
the republicans on the finance committee including senate minority 
leader bob dole of kansas voted in favor of it 
for all the troubles in the end we agree said sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny chief sponsor and architect of the plan 
we learned to talk to each other and listen and learn 
while a majority of senate democrats and republicans may have 
reached a fragile consensus reagan administration officials have 
raised numerous objections to the bill and have said they will 
recommend a veto 
but moynihan said the support of the finance committee which 
has killed many reform efforts in the last two decades is evidence 
that welfare reform has come too far to fail 
if the president vetoes it the next president will sign it 
he said 
both senate majority leader robert byrd dwva and finance 
committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas have said they want to 
complete senate action on the moynihan bill and achieve a 
compromise with the house before the end of the year 
the house passed a broad plan last year that according to 
rough preliminary estimates by the congressional budget office 
would cost 71 billion over five years 
unlike the senate bill the house would give states financial 
incentives to raise their benefits until 1991 in many states 
welfare payments amount to less than half the federal poverty 
standard 
both bills would require states to take stronger steps to 
establish paternity and collect child support from absent parents 
the provisions include automatic wagewithholding from paychecks in 
some cases 
states would also have to set up education training and job 
programs for welfare recipients and spend half their money on those 
considered most difficult to help such as teenage mothers child 
care transportation and medicaid assistance would be provided 
and states would have to allow cash benefits for twoparent 
families in which the principal wageearner is unemployed only 26 
now do so the bill says the assistance would only have to be 
available for six months of each year 
voting against the bill were sens william armstrong rcolo 
malcolm wallop rwyo and william roth rdel 
armstrong echoing the administrations objections said the 
bill would increase rather than decrease welfare dependency he 
said the twoparent welfare provision would add 130000 families to 
the rolls while transitional child care and medical benefits for 
recipients moving into the workforce would add another 500000 
armstrong and the administration support a less expensive 913 
million plan that has been introduced in the house and senate by 
republicans 
the money for the senate bill would be raised by extending the 
internal revenue services debt collection program and phasing out 
childcare tax credits for highincome families 
in holding hearings and making arguments for his bill moynihan 
often noted that one out of three american children is on welfare 
before the age of 18

government statistics may be signaling the 
beginning of the end of a mid1980s trend that saw booming growth 
in coastal states outstrip the rest of the country economists say 
residents of densely populated coastal states like connecticut 
new jersey massachussets and california continued to have the 
highest average incomes in the nation last year the commerce 
department said wednesday 
states like mississippi west virginia utah and louisiana that 
are dependent on farming mining or oil were at or near the bottom 
connecticut was the highestincome state in the nation with an 
average of 20980 earned for every man woman and child in 1987 
that was more than double the 10204 income in mississippi the 
perennial lastplace finisher 
also as in the recent past income growth was strongest in the 
northeast and weakest in energy and mining states 
but rudolph e depass an analyst with the commerce department 
says the figures show growth is accelerating in the southwest and 
rocky mountain regions and slowing elsewhere 
the national average in 1987 was 15340 up 48 percent from a 
year earlier taking the 44 percent inflation rate into account 
it was the worst gain since the recession year of 1982 
that was reflected in even the healthiest regions the growth of 
income in new england fell from 76 percent in 1986 to 67 percent 
last year income growth slipped from 65 percent to 6 percent in 
the midatlantic states 
however income growth in the tottering southwest increased from 
09 percent to 22 percent it improved in the mountain states from 
35 percent to 36 percent 
i think its signaling the end of the bicoastal economy 
said mark zandi an economist with the wefa group a 
philadelphiaarea forecasting service 
the bicoastal trend came to the forefront in 1984 and 
continued on through most of the first half of 1987 since last 
summer the bicoastal phenomenon has been on the wane zandi 
said 
as we move into 1989 and 1990 it will become a thing of the 
past almost as the sun beltfrost belt phenomenon waned in the 
middle 1980s he said 
zandi cited these reasons 
the increase in exports which are growing as the falling 
dollar makes us goods cheaper overseas will boost manufacturing 
in the midwest and in parts of the south 
oil and commodity prices are on the way up brightening 
prospects for the oil patch farm belt and mining states 
growth in the economys service sector which had benefited 
financial centers like new york boston and los angeles is 
slowing the effects of the october stock market collapse are more 
severe there than elsewhere 
eastern states and california which rode the growth of high 
technology firms are running into a tight labor market making it 
likely that companies will look to expand elsewhere 
we can expect to see slower growth in the bicoastal states and 
stronger growth in the states in the middle zandi said 
new jersey with income of 20067 ranked second in 1987 and 
masschussetts with income of 18926 was third the district of 
columbia with income of 20303 would have been second if it was 
included in the rankings 
alaska which took over the no1 spot from connecticut at the 
start of the oil boom in 1973 and held it until 1985 fell to fifth 
in 1987 its average income actually fell 07 percent last year to 
17886 
rounding out the top 10 were new york maryland california new 
hampshire illinois and virginia 
seven of the 10 states with the lowest per capita income were in 
the south in addition to mississippi they were west virginia 
arkansas louisiana alabama south carolina and kentucky utah 
new mexico and idaho energy and mining states were also in the 
lowest 10 
other than alaska wyoming was the only state where average 
income declined in 1987 by 01 percent to 12759 but the 
shrinkage was not as bad as the states 11 percent decline in 1986

a measure extending the deadline for illegal 
aliens to apply for amnesty faces a difficult fight in the senate 
and a possible presidential veto after clearing the house by a 
narrow margin 
the 213201 house vote wednesday would move the deadline from 
may 4 to nov 30 the extension would represent the first change in 
the landmark immigration law signed by president reagan in november 
1986 
but the immigration and naturalization service issued a warning 
late wednesday to potential applicants that they should heed the 
current may 4 deadline 
ins is concerned that this misguided legislation will create 
confusion among potential applicants and cause them to delay filing 
beyond the may 4 cutoff date the service said in a statement it 
said legalization offices will remain open on may 4 until midnight 
to process applications and that aliens should continue to expect 
that the last date to apply will be may 4 
the immigration law enacted in 1986 was finely tuned legislation 
that carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens 
with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented 
workers 
the narrow margin of wednesdays vote demonstrated that amnesty 
for those who came to this country illegally remains an emotional 
issue in 1986 the house approved the amnesty program as part of 
the immigration bill by only seven votes 
the extension is opposed by sen alan k simpson rwyo the 
chief senate author of the 1986 law and other conservatives 
the immigration law is a delicately balanced bill that uses a 
carrot and stick approach to stop illegal aliens from pouring 
across us borders 
aliens who came to the united states illegally but have lived 
here continuously since before jan 1 1982 were given one year to 
apply for temporary residency as the first step toward permanent 
status the 12month deadline is may 4 
on the enforcement side the law established severe fines for 
employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers 
those favoring the extension argue the immigration and 
naturalization service reacted too slowly at the onset of the 
amnesty period and did not get out the word to the immigrant 
communities to apply for temporary residency 
in addition many illegal aliens were thought to fear appearing 
at an office of the ins the agency that is also in the business of 
deporting those here illegally 
in fact the law prohibits the ins amnesty employees from 
sharing their records with enforcement agents 
those opposing the amnesty extension in the house were basically 
the same members who never liked the idea they said that aliens 
who refused to come forward were simply procrastinators and that 
the carefully structured bill should not be changed to accommodate 
them 
with the deadline approaching the chief senate advocate of the 
extension sen edward m kennedy dmass plans to have a vote 
scheduled quickly in that chamber he is chairman of the senate 
judiciary immigration subcommittee and sponsored the chambers 
extension proposal 
if the bill should get through the senate there could be 
additional problems at the white house 
the commissioner of the ins alan c nelson and office of 
management and budget officials have already said they would 
recommend a presidential veto if the bill reaches reagans desk 
simpson commented wednesday our numbers are right on target 
with the projections we used when we passed the bill i do not 
honestly see a need or justification for extending the signup 
period 
during house debate the chief sponsor of the extension rep 
romano l mazzoli dky said 12 million aliens have applied for 
the general amnesty program and 729000 have received temporary 
residency cards another 400000 have applied for a separate 
agricultural amnesty program that is not affected by the extension 
legislation 
before the final vote the house approved by voice vote an 
amendment designed to cut down on fraud during any extension period 
the house also defeated 167246 an amendment that would have 
only accepted applications after may 4 from aliens who could 
demonstrate good cause for missing the deadline

if chrysler corp wants its workers 
to accept japanesestyle production its executives should accept 
markedly lower japanesestyle pay the united auto workers chief 
negotiator said wednesday 
the remarks by uaw vice president marc stepp came in the third 
day of chrysler contract talks and a day after chrysler disclosed 
that chairman lee iacocca earned 179 million in 1987 in salary 
cash and stock bonuses and money earned exercising stock options 
granted when chrysler stock was a fraction of its present value 
iacoccas 1987 earnings made him the highestpaid auto executive 
for the second year in a row in 1986 when he earned 206 
million iacocca also was the nations highestpaid executive 
executive compensations have gotten completely out of hand 
it makes it extremely difficult for us to sit down in a 
rational manner and try to negotiate a decent contract stepp 
said adding that after hearing about iacoccas pay workers called 
union officials demanding higher pay and other benefits 
chrysler vice president anthony st john the companys chief 
negotiator said tuesday that chrysler has asked union leaders to 
support a company push for adoption of socalled modern operating 
agreements at all plants 
the japanesestyle moa system organizes workers into teams uses 
them for a variety of jobs instead of a single defined task and 
reduces the number of workers needed to fill in for absentees 
inspect products and correct mistakes 
we think it is only fair that since they ask us to go to a 
japanese production system such as moas and team concept it is 
fair for them to go to the japanese system in terms of 
compensation stepp said 
japanese managers earn six to eight times more than japanese 
workers while american managers earn about 18 times more than 
their workers and in iacoccas case 27 times stepp said 
chrysler workers earn 1443 an hour including costofliving 
adjustments or gross base pay of about 30000 stepp also said 
that before japanese workers are laid off or their pay is cut 
japanese managers take a pay cut 
the chrysler contract expires sept 14 it covers 59000 active 
workers and 7000 on layoff in 15 states and 65000 retirees 
negotiators return to the table monday prepared to bargain 
continuously until a contract is reached stepp said

jesse jackson is moving up to the fundraising 
league of gov michael dukakis who has consistently outpaced all 
other democratic presidential candidates new financial reports 
show 
dukakis last month raised a total of 34 million including 
621098 in federal matching funds jackson reported raising 28 
million including 330189 from the federal matching account it 
was jacksons biggest ever fundraising month 
in money that came directly from contributors jackson took in 
2 million to dukakis 24 million 
meanwhile sen albert gore jr who was expected to suspend his 
campaign today ran up a debt of 16 million during march he took 
out 15 million in loans including 40000 in a personal loan to 
the campaign 
gore borrowed the money to spend on the march 8 super tuesday 
series of 20 primaries on which he had pinned his hopes 
he then borrowed another 100000 more this month before 
tuesdays new york primary where he pulled a disappointing 10 
percent of the vote trailing far behind dukakis and jackson 
dukakis has taken no loans jackson borrowed 250000 during 
march 
gores overall receipts for march were 34 million of which 
336312 was matching funds his report showed 
because he received less than 10 percent of the vote in two 
previous successive primaries gore lost his eligibility for 
federal matching funds under election law he would have to get an 
unlikely 20 percent of the vote in pennsylvanias primary next week 
in order to reestablish his eligibility 
among republicans former tv evangelist pat robertson borrowed 
410000 to keep his campaign afloat during march including a 
25000 loan from himself to the campaign 
he has had to lay off most of his staff and almost totally 
eliminate other campaign expenditures because he was up against the 
maximum 27 million spending cap that the fec imposes on candidates 
who receive federal matching funds 
he ended march with 14 million in debts and only 61890 in 
cash on hand 
robertson spent 78 million during march repaying some of his 
previous bank loans he has conceded that vice president george 
bush will win the nomination but robertson technically remains a 
candidate 
bushs fundraising crew has closed up shop having raised the 
maximum 27 million that primary candidates can spend during 
march he raised 17 million of which 247118 was in the form of 
federal matching funds 
he ended the month with 36 million in the bank to cover close 
to 1 million in outstanding obligations at the end of march he 
had spent 189 million against the base spending cap of 23 
million plus the maximum 46 million allowed for fundraising 
expenses 
bushs treasurer fred bush said earlier this month that 
overall fund raising for the campaign had hit 30 million that 
included 3 million for legal and accounting costs which are not 
subject to the spending limit 
robertson reported raising 23 million during march of which 
896551 was federal matching funds and 873444 was money from 
contributors 
with the expensive june 7 california contest still down the road 
and a handful of others before it the remaining democrats will be 
refocusing on fundraising efforts 
dukakis ended march with 17 million in cash on hand to cover 
697162 in bills 
jackson had 865946 in the bank and 678973 in debts 
gore ended the month with a debt of 16 million and 416603 
in cash on hand 
gop contender jack kemp the congressman from new york who 
dropped out of the race during march was left with a debt he 
ended the month 672826 in the red but was anticipating more than 
500000 in federal matching funds to help retire that he had only

a volunteer program backed by the 
local roman catholic church has been launched to prepare chileans 
for their first election in 15 years and organizers hope calm the 
countrys stormy political waters 
however the effort already has stirred up controversy of its 
own drawing fire from backers of the rightwing military 
government which charges that it favors the opposition 
leaders of the program called the crusade for citizen 
participation say they hope to recruit 200000 volunteers across 
the country for a doortodoor campaign starting in july they say 
the aim is to promote voter registration and to provide electors 
with nonpartisan information about their options 
most people want a peaceful transition to democracy the 
crusades director monica jimenez said in an interview its 
our task to see that this happens 
she said the crusades participants also will monitor the 
elections outcome to ensure that it is respectable and 
respected 
the government plans a yesorno ballot later this year on a 
single presidential candidate to be picked by the chiefs of the 
armed forces and national police no date has been set 
president augusto pinochet the rightwing army commander who 
seized power in a 1973 coup is seen as the most likely candidate 
in order to win the candidate must garner 50 percent of the yes 
vote plus one 
if the candidate wins he will begin an eightyear term in march 
1989 if he loses an open election will be held in early 1990 and 
pinochet will remain in power in the meantime according to chiles 
1980 constitution 
the countrys last election was in march 1973 the military 
government has held and won two referendums on political or 
constitutional questions 
mrs jimenez a university professor and social worker active in 
church affairs said she came up with the idea for the crusade a 
year ago under the auspices of a churchrun foundation she 
studied similar projects in other countries they included 
argentina and uruguay which have returned to civilian rule in 
recent years as well as the united states 
i had trouble crystallizing the idea so it helped a great 
deal to visit and study similar programs elsewhere she said 
she obtained a 1 million grant from the interamerican human 
rights institute based in costa rica to print educational 
material train volunteers and pay for television and radio 
publicity 
the training manuals for volunteers quickly prompted charges of 
bias from progovernment sectors for instructing that in part a 
yes vote means giving support to the operation of a 
presidentialist authoritarian regime characterized by a regime 
of limited citizen participation 
a no vote means reestablishing a balance of powers and 
eliminating the control by the armed forces over civilian 
authorities the instructions say 
citing the material a commentary in the governmentrun 
newspaper la nacion complained of the crusades slanted 
tendentious and partisan spirit 
its leaders dont even bother to disguise their opposition 
tendencies the commentary said 
mrs jimenez responded because we live in such a polarized 
atmosphere to talk of democracy is to already take a side this is 
the difficulty we are facing 
she said describing the pinochet government as authoritarian 
is a fact not a value judgement im not using it in the 
pejorative sense 
the crusade appears highly organized several supervisors said 
they took part in organizing pope john paul iis april 1987 tour of 
chile and were drawing on that experience 
at a roman catholic retreat in punta de tralca a coastal 
community 60 miles west of santiago hundreds of firstlevel 
volunteers from across the country receive intensive training in 
threeday sessions they are required to recruit other volunteers 
in their regions who in turn will seek out more participants in 
each community 
when the voting takes place the crusade will be out to try to 
ensure that there is no undue pressure from any sector she 
said 
the punta de tralca training sessions have a distinct catholic 
missionary flavor upon graduation the trainees sing a religious 
hymn and are given neckerchiefs of yellow and white the vatican 
colors the crusades logo of the same colors is in the shape of 
a cross 
chile like other latin american countries is overwhelmingly 
catholic 
at the end of one recent training session a santiago priest 
the rev pedro arregui told the volunteers they were like 
lights small and fragile that are going to light up chile from 
end to end 
you are carriers of a great message a message that should 
change this nation he said 
above him a broad banner quoted pope john paul ii chile has a 
vocation of comprehension not confrontation 
mrs jimenez said a central goal of the crusade is to inject 
some reason into chiles highly impassioned political arena where 
pro and antigovernment sectors wildly sling charges at each other 
for the opposition pinochet is a bloodstained tyrant while he 
calls opposition leaders the selfish pawns of international 
communism 
an important number of people have already decided whether to 
vote yes or no mrs jimenez said but when you talk to them 
you realize that often they are decisions of an emotional not 
rational basis 
the more rational the political debate the less likely it is 
that turmoil will break out when the election is decided she said 
we are trying to promote proper civic behavior

huge polka dots and full sleeves gathered at the elbows above black 
gloves

a lavish red headdress and gown the train had a train sewn on 
piggyback 
paris couturier christian lacroix was the designer and in the 
spirit of the occasion some women in the benefit audience wore 
lacroix gowns it was said that the ballets lavish costumes cost 
more than 500000 paid for by a private donor zack browns 
scenery with a pink polkadotted bow holding up the chandelier 
was the perfect setting

relatives of some american servicemen missing 
in the vietnam war say the government is hiding information that 
may show some prisoners are still alive and they want congress to 
approve a bill declassifying the data 
but the administration and the official organization 
representing powmia families say there is no truth to the charges 
and they oppose the measure as harmful to the american effort to 
account for all the missing personnel 
the two sides squared off on the sensitive issue wednesday 
before a house subcommittee which is considering the measure 
dozens of family members many wearing buttons supporting the bill 
jammed a hearing room 
the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asian affairs took no 
action on the measure which would require declassification of more 
data about socalled live sightings 
the defense department still lists 2404 us personnel as 
unaccounted for 13 years after the war ended president reagan has 
said an accounting is of the highest national priority 
the official us position is that the administration cannot 
rule out the possibility that some americans are still held against 
their will although vietnam cambodia and laos all say they have 
no prisoners some remains have periodically been returned from the 
area 
those who believe the us government is purposefully 
withholding information about pows have cited a variety of reasons 
those include the us wish for better relations with vietnam and 
the governments refusal to admit it had left some prisoners behind 
after the official prisoner exchange in 1973 when 591 american pows 
were set free 
in recent years a number of americans have privately searched 
for americans they believe are still being held in southeast asia 
but have found nothing the us government has opposed those 
efforts 
rep jack davis rill a cosponsor of the bill said i am 
convinced of the possibility that there are prisoners of war from 
the vietnam war still alive in southeast asia and i believe that 
the bill is a critical step in raising the awareness necessary to 
find an answer and know for certain 
retired army col earl p hopper sr father of an air force 
flier shot down 20 years ago said he and other families have been 
misled by government officials about us knowledge on the powmia 
issue 
it is because of those experiences and the fact that we have 
seen evidence in the form of cia documents proving our men were 
abandoned and never negotiated for coupled with the lack of a 
competent intelligence capability focused on securing information 
on our live pows that we support the bill he said 
we are suspicious of everything government officials 
including those in the reagan administration said hopper who 
said he is chairman of an organization called the live pow 
committee which he said represents 1500 powmia family members 
but ann mills griffiths executive director the national league 
of powmia families noted that similar charges in 1983 led to a 
similar bill which was rejected by a house committee 
she added that two congressional investigations two internal 
defense department audits and a special study by lt gen eugene 
tighe usaf retired former director of the defense intelligence 
agency have completely discredited those unfounded allegations 
we have total confidence in the presidents commitment and 
determination to fulfill his pledge to act decisively on confirmed 
information she said 
karl d jackson deputy assistant secretary of defense and army 
col joseph a schlatter chief of the defense intelligence 
agencys special powmia office said publication of information 
would make it more difficult for them to gather information

reports that recreational vehicles built on a 
modified general motors corp chassis may spray fuel has led 
federal regulators to urge a recall before the peak summer travel 
months 
the national highway traffic administration urged the recall 
before the warmer summer vacation season begins in a letter to 
10 manufacturers even though the regulatory agency has not 
determined a safety problem exists 
a consumers group estimated up to 10000 vehicles could be 
recalled precise figures on the number of vehicles were 
unavailable 
the center for auto safety a consumers group often at odds with 
the auto industry and regulators said it has received 36 reports 
of fuel spurting resulting in seven fires two injuries and one 
death from motor homes built on modified p30 chassis 
the spurting occurs when fuel leaks or sprays from the filler 
neck particularly after the gas cap is removed 
nhtsas recall recommendation included motor homes built on 1984 
through 1986 gm p30 chassis equipped with a 454 v8 engine 
our review of the available information indicates a potential 
safety defect exists in the fuel reservoir system of certain 
motor homes the nhtsa letter said 
the gm chassis had been modified in the fuel reservoir exhaust 
system or vapor recovery system the nhtsa letter said 
dave mcnitt comptroller for travelcraft one of the companies 
sent the nhtsa letter said the manufacturer believes its motor 
homes are free from safety defects 
basically the only thing that is done to a unit is 
occasionally the gas tank that comes with a unit is replaced by a 
larger tank he said 
a study by the center for auto safety concluded that 84 percent 
of fuelspurting occurs between may 1 and october 1 
all motor home owners should be alert to the danger of 
overpressurized fuel and never remove the fuel cap if they hear 
hissing from the fuel tank said clarence ditlow the centers 
director 
robert dewey of the center estimated 5000 to 10000 motor homes 
could be recalled saying the number was imprecise because nhtsa 
was in the early stages of its investigation 
nhtsa said the recall recommendation was sent to travelcraft

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is 
increasingly popular in britain france and west germany but only 
about half of those polled there by the us information agency 
believe he has done much to improve human rights in his country 
a majority of those in france 59 percent maintain that 
gorbachev does not promote human rights in the soviet union the 
west germans are almost evenly divided on this issue only the 
british 54 percent say gorbachev does at least a fairly good 
job of promoting human rights in the soviet union according to 
an agency survey in those three nations 
general attitudes about the soviet union followed the same 
pattern with 40 percent of the french having a favorable opinion 
and 50 percent unfavorable 70 percent of the germans favorable and 
22 percent unfavorable and 58 percent of the british favorable and 
28 percent unfavorable the remainder were undecided 
while gorbachevs popularity has climbed president reagans 
ratings have remained fairly constant over the past six months 
according to the poll 
gorbachev enjoys an overwhelmingly favorable opinion in west 
germany 90 percent and britain 88 percent and a substantially 
favorable image in france 70 percent according to agency 
analysis of a telephone survey conducted in those three countries 
march 1923 
in the past half year those rating gorbachev very favorably 
have increased from 16 percent to 36 percent in britain and from 8 
percent to 33 percent in germany the agency analysis said 
in france gorbachevs popularity has remained fairly constant 
with 69 percent giving him a favorable rating last september 68 
percent favorable last november and 70 percent favorable in march 
the percentage of those polled in france who had a favorable 
impression of reagan was 62 percent and 44 percent in both west 
germany and great britain about the same as last september and 
november 
an analysis of the results which did not indicate the number of 
people polled was circulated among us government officials 
earlier this month and obtained wednesday by the associated press 
the poll had a margin of error of 4 percent 
usia which handles overseas cultural and public relations for 
the government periodically conducts such opinion surveys this 
one was designed to gauge the mood in europe before the may 29june 
2 ussoviet summit in moscow 
among those polled the highest priority for ussoviet arms 
control negotiations was the strategic arms reductions talks 
designed to cut longrange nuclear arsenals the second priority 
was reduction in shortrange nuclear weapons and the distant third 
priority was reducing conventional arms 
that stacking of priorities appears closer to the soviet than to 
the nato stance 
the north atlantic treaty organization has balked at 
negotiations to reduce battlefield nuclear weapons which many 
western military analysts view as necessary to deter a potential 
attack by soviet conventional forces 
nato leaders want to reduce what they call a 21 soviet 
advantage in conventional forces soviet officials argue that while 
they have the edge in some weapons such as tanks they trail in 
others such as antitank weapons 
the survey found high support for the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces pact signed at the washington summit last december 93 
percent in germany 80 percent in britain and 74 percent in france

a house committee will consider a bill to 
break all business ties between the united states and south africa 
the measure would ban exports from that country into the united 
states and from this country to south africa and would require 
american companies with offices or factories in south africa to 
pull out 
supporters the majority of them democrats say this is the most 
effective way to pressure south africa into dropping its racial 
segregation policies 
opponents argue such a trade cutoff would cost south african 
blacks some 2 million jobs and would hurt american farmers and 
manufacturers who export their goods 
the way to end apartheid is by infusing south africa with 
capital to help blacks improve their standard of living said rep 
gerald solomon rny if we can help them better themselves 
they will throw off their shackles on their own he said 
the bill would affect about 11 billion dollars of us 
investments in south africa as well as some 26 billion dollars 
in trade 
a group of south african businessmen took out a fullpage ad in 
wednesdays washington post warning sanctions targeted at whites 
would stifle the countrys development and hurt the black majority 
two house subcommittees approved the legislation wednesday and 
the foreign affairs committee is scheduled to debate it next week 
passage through the house is virtually assured but the bills fate 
in the senate is less certain 
exempt from the ban would be the imports of strategic minerals 
such as chromium platinum and manganese which the united states 
cannot obtain elsewhere but the bill would require the 
administration to set up a program to reduce us dependence on 
south africa for such materials 
the bill authored by rep ron dellums dcalif is far more 
comprehensive than the sanctions against south africa approved in 
1986 after congress overrode president reagans veto 
those measures affected about onethird of south african 
imports mainly agricultural products and computers and less than 
3 percent of us exports to south africa it banned new us 
investments but permitted existing ones to remain 
the new ban which would take effect within six months of the 
bills enactment would also exempt the donation of food medicine 
and other humanitarian assistance as well as us government aid 
programs for blacks 
other provisions include 
a ban on the transport of oil to south africa from anywhere in 
the world by usowned or registered ships 
a ban on military and intelligence cooperation between us 
government agencies and the south african authorities this would 
cancel the posting of us and south african military attaches in 
each others capitals 
a ban on us federal leases for coal gas and oil deals to 
nonamericans who invest in south africa 
closure of two south african consulates in the united states 
and limited approval of visa requests by south africans wishing to 
visit the united states 
a ban on direct flights to and from south africa such a ban is 
included in the 1986 sanctions and is in effect now

fidel castro met late wednesday with 
cardinal john oconnor of new york a government official said 
after the roman catholic prelate celebrated an emotional and 
historic mass 
the cuban leader received oconnor at the presidential palace at 
about 11 pm 10 pm edt according to a spokesman for the 
foreign relations ministry after the cardinal finished saying mass 
at havanas cathedral 
reporters were hustled out of the mass at 9 pm and brought to 
the palace where they were told castro and oconnor would be 
available for a photo session but at 1130 pm it was announced 
that castro canceled the session because oconnor had been late 
arriving at the palace there was no word on what was discussed or 
how long the meeting would last 
oconnor received thunderous applause as he walked in a 
procession to the altar of the 284yearold cathedral in havanas 
colonial district 
about 2000 people crammed the baroque building shouting 
bravo and applauding as 75 whitecloaked clergymen walked 
slowly toward the altar 
one man grabbed oconnors hand and kissed it as he went by 
there has been a mistake the cardinal said jokingly in 
spanish youve welcomed me as a pope but i am only a cardinal 
a poor cardinal 
the heat inside the cathedral was stifling and many people 
fanned themselves with the latest edition of the communist party 
daily granma 
oconnor is the first american cardinal to visit cuba since 
castro came to power in 1959 and this was his first mass since 
arriving in havana on tuesday 
the cardinal spoke in spanish and frequently departed from a 
prepared statement according to gerald costello editor in chief 
of catholic new york a weekly catholic newspaper costello briefed 
reporters at the presidential palace 
the church must be allowed to develop its role as a bridge 
with the freedom which allows open communication with its faithful 
and with the rest of society oconnor said 
despite years of religious restrictions in this officially 
atheist nation people in the crowd said they had no fear of 
showing their faith 
one woman said her husband alberto jane padron has been in 
prison 22 years he is not a criminal hes just a catholic 
who fought against the government ruby padron said of her 
husband 
when asked if she was nervous about being a practicing roman 
catholic mrs padron said no that was in the past its 
different now the hands of the red communist government are 
easier not so harsh 
mrs padron gave a reporter a letter to give to oconnor which 
she said was on behalf of her husband and other political prisoners 
another woman also thurst a letter in a reporters hand she 
only said the letter in a sealed envelope was for oconnor on her 
husbands behalf

a congressional study says the superfund 
program remains a hazardous waste merrygoround posing 
longterm problems for the nation despite improvements ordered by 
congress in 1986 
dangerous chemicals that should be destroyed are instead still 
being shifted from one waste dump to another or covered with caps 
that could allow toxics to leak into water supplies according to 
the congressional office of technology assessment 
that is the major finding from an ongoing ota review of the 1986 
law congress passed to strengthen the environmental protection 
agencys frequently criticized superfund cleanup efforts 
superfund is not working joel hirschhorn a senior 
associate of the congressional office of technology assessment 
told the house public works oversight and investigations 
subcommittee on wednesday public expectations are not being met 
by the current cleanup program 
in an assessment disputed by epa officials hirschhorn said 
in too many cases little protection of public health and the 
environment is being obtained by the 16 billion superfund is 
spending each year 
one of the basic directives that congress gave epa in 1986 was 
to permanently destroy to the maximum extent practicable the 
contaminated waste found at the worst of the nations tens of 
thousands of chemical dumps 
hirschhorn said however that epa has opted for destruction 
usually by costly but effective incineration in only 20 percent of 
the cleanup plans approved since the 1986 law took effect 
more often he said waste is still being switched to other 
sites covered by caps or treated through new but unproven 
technological processes 
offsite land disposal means that the hazardous waste problem 
rides a merrygoround hirschhorn testified the problem will 
keep growing faster than the solution we are going to have 
hundreds if not thousands of sites around the country where the 
best technologies are not chosen for the cleanup 
he also had an ominous financial warning saying the otas 1985 
estimate that the nation evenutally would have to spend 300 
billion to clean up the mess may prove low 
hirschhorn who offered no new cost estimate said the otas 
studies of epas cleanup plans show some environmental problems are 
ignored in order to avoid destruction of waste 
epa decided to put a cap on the compass industries site in 
oklahoma but made no commitment to treat contaminated groundwater 
flowing into the arkansas river according to ota 
the epas cleanup plan said however the potential for future 
fires and continued offsite migration of contaminants pose adverse 
human health and environmental impacts 
hirschhorn said ota also found instances where inaccurately high 
cost estimates for incineration led epa to select cheaper but 
untested methods to destroy wastes he said ota believes that in 
these cases incineration would have cost about the same 
epa administrator lee thomas said the agency is aiming at 
permanent treatment of wastes and that a majority of the cleanups 
involve such treatment of at least a portion of the chemicals found 
at a site 
j winston porter head of epas solid waste program said the 
agency has not yet settled on a definition of permanent he 
said that if all hazardous waste at a site were destroyed only six 
or eight cleanups could be financed each year epa is under 
congressional order to have 175 underway by this october

most states are not spending enough money to 
properly regulate the highly sophisticated and computerized 
insurance industry says a survey by a consumer group backed by 
insurance agents 
the unusual alliance of consumer advocates and insurance 
salesmen concluded in a study released wednesday that only four 
insurance departments those in florida new york vermont and the 
virgin islands spend enough to meet its standard 
all of the other 43 governments surveyed need to spend more of 
their insurance premium tax collections to improve the industry 
said the consumer insurance interest group 
the group recommended that 10 percent of insurance tax premiums 
be used to support state insurance commissions the average found 
in the survey is 537 percent down from 7 percent in 1985 
the group set up and funded by the national association of 
professional insurance agents pia with longtime consumer advocate 
esther peterson as chairwoman hopes to convince states to regulate 
the industry more closely 
insurance agents and most major insurance companies want this 
because they want to weed out insolvent companies said pia 
presidentelect david l ream of cleveland ohio at a news 
conference with other officials involved in the survey 
the survey says states receive an overwhelming average of 
23000 complaints a year but twothirds of the departments 
surveyed dont even have written procedures for handling the 
complaints 
many log complaints manually without computers the survey says 
some states lack basic computer systems to deal with the 
massive amounts of information said j robert hunter national 
insurance consumer organization president and a member of the 
survey group the insurance industry is one of the most 
sophisticated users of computer technology yet some insurance 
departments are lacking the basics in automation 
the study recommends a group be formed by the national 
association of insurance commissioners to develop guidelines for 
each state department to follow in handling complaints 
ms peterson a consumer specialist for presidents lyndon b 
johnson and jimmy carter is pias consumer adviser 
she said the study of 44 states the district of columbia 
puerto rico and the virgin islands represents a breakthrough in 
relations beteen consumer advocates and one part of the insurance 
industry six states departments did not respond to the initial 
survey sent in september 1987 and were not included in the study 
pia president willis j hargrave jr of houston texas said the 
study found state insurance commissions are more effective than in 
the past but have failed to keep pace with the industry 
other major conclusions of the report were 
many departments lack personnel and resources to properly 
regulate insurers the study recommends enough personnel for 
financial examinations of each insurance company at least once 
every three years which is currently done by less than half the 
states 
state governments allocate an average of less than 
sixonehundredths of a percent of their budgets to insurance 
regulation although the average consumer spends 15 percent of his 
disposable income on insurance 
salaries of insurance department professionals are far below 
comparable salaries in the private sector and slightly below those 
holding comparable jobs in other branches of state government the 
study recommends a salary audit every two years 
the survey showed annual salaries of state insurance 
commissioners ranging from 33342 in montana to 85656 in 
florida and average examiner salaries varied from 14682 in 
puerto rico to 69875 in kentucky 
states need more actuaries and consumer professionals involved 
in regulating the industry the survey recommends that each state 
hire at least one of each

the us financial squeeze on panama needs to 
be reevaluated because it is failing to pressure gen manuel 
antonio noriega out of office two former diplomats told congress 
if anything the tactics have entrenched noriega said 
francis mcneil who left the state department last year after a 
career that included service as ambassador in costa rica and deputy 
assistant secretary for intelligence 
noriega may hang on long enough to bring the pillars of 
the temple down around him blaming the gringos for the ruin he has 
brought upon panama said mcneil who left the department in a 
dispute with assistant secretary elliott abrams 
and jack vaughn who was ambassador to panama during the johnson 
administration called on the administration to drop its policy of 
unilateral pressure and enlist allies in the effort to depose 
noreiga 
weve never had allies in latin america to speak of he told 
the house foreign affairs western hemisphere subcommittee on 
wednesday 
the testimony came as the state department disclosed that 
abrams principal deputy michael g kozak remains in panama with 
a us delegation reviewing us moves so far and assessing options 
for further action 
there has been division within the administration on how best to 
deal with noriega one side wants to step up pressure on noriega to 
give up power and go into exile by imposing trade sanctions or even 
taking military action the other says the us should negotiate 
and perhaps ease pressure in hopes that he will accept a graceful 
exit 
vaughn told the panel noriega is likely to cling to power for 
months despite us efforts to oust him and will likely be 
followed by a leftist regime 
even if we are successful in deposing noriega the price of 
20 years of inexcusable tolerance and blindness is likely to be a 
strongly leftist government he said 
such a shift to the left in panama would be spurred by 
resentment toward the united states because of its support for 
noriega over the past two decades and its blind eye to corruption 
and fraudulent elections vaughn testified 
he said the united states has underestimated noriegas staying 
power he said noriegas durability is tied to his godfather 
status in the regional cocaine cartel and to deep and broad 
corruption in the panamanian government and in its panamanian 
defense forces 
noriega took power following the 1981 death of former panamanian 
ruler gen omar torrijos 
the cancer in the pdf has metastasized vaughn said 
theyve been at it for 20 years with the full knowledge of the 
state department congress and the us military 
subcommittee chairman george crockett dmich said an economic 
squeeze intended to chase noriega has so far succeeded only in 
imposing hardships on the countrys population the general 
remains firmly in power he said 
mcneil said financial pressures on noriega bear a similarity 
to chemotherapy treatment that can only work if it is of limited 
duration because the side effects are too great 
even if noriega leaves because of the pressure we face a 
situation in which we may wind up judging that the operation was 
successful but that the patient panama has died 
mcneil called for mediation run by latin americans between 
noriega and his internal opposition offers to carry out such talks 
have been made by the church and the organization of american 
states

a woman accused of putting cyanide into 
nonprescription pain remedies that killed her husband and another 
woman was deeply in debt and wanted more from life than her 
marriage could provide a prosecutor said 
this is about her anger her frustration her obsession 
assistant us attorney joanne maida said of stella nickell in 
opening statements wednesday before a us district court jury 
mrs nickell the first person in the united states charged with 
causing death by tampering with overthecounter capsules plotted 
the killings to collect insurance money but failed in her attempt 
to make them look like random murders ms maida said 
mrs nickell is charged in the june 1986 deaths of her 
52yearold husband bruce nickell and of susan katherine snow 
40 both of auburn by putting cyanide in capsules of 
extrastrength excedrin the prosecution has suggested no links 
between the victims except the way they died 
she also faces three counts of tampering with a product involved 
in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two 
extrastrength excedrin bottles and an anacin3 bottle that were 
recovered in stores in kent and auburn suburbs between seattle and 
tacoma 
the deaths resulted in a nationwide tampering scare and 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers recalled all its 
nonprescription medicine sold in capsule form 
defense attorney thomas hillier said that there were reasonable 
explanations for many of the prosecutions points and that much of 
its case was circumstantial 
ms maida contended that mrs nickell had an obsession of 
several years in duration to kill her husband 
the fbi was contacted in january 1987 by mrs nickells 
daughter cindy hamilton who said her mother had been researching 
drugs and contract killings for several years according to the 
prosecutor 
hillier said mrs nickell would take the stand to contradict her 
daughters statements 
ms maida also noted that mrs nickell was found to have checked 
out five library books that discussed cyanide and poisonous doses 
hillier said mrs nickell got the books because they contained 
information about poisonous plants and she was concerned about 
potential danger from local toxic plants to her granddaughter and 
children for whom she babysat 
hillier also played down the couples marital problems saying 
they were due to financial stress although nickell became a 
permanent state employee in january 1986 the couple was heavily in 
debt and faced foreclosure on their trailer home he said

a year after a partially built 
apartment building collapsed families workers and rescuers who 
toiled for nine days in the fruitless search for survivors remain 
tormented by the loss of 28 lives 
in all of my 22 years as an attorney and in all of the 
hundreds if not thousands of cases i have been involved in never 
have i seen the emotional effect lingering as long as i have in 
this case said richard bieder lead counsel for the victims 
families 
to what do i attribute that i guess i would have to say to 
the enormity of the loss and the fact that the loss seemed so 
purposeless bieder said 
one survivor william pelkey 44 of prospect was standing 20 
feet away when the lambiance plaza apartment complex fell in a 
thundering roar on april 23 1987 his employer the waterbury 
foundation co lost 11 workers 
pelkey stayed in construction work but says hes more cautious 
and is disturbed by noise 
i never talk about it he said none of us do 
june page of hamden said she struggles daily with the memory of 
her son johns death page 30 was married but had no children 
the hard thing is where do you go now they murdered him 
as far as im concerned mrs page said quietly 
lambiance plaza collapsed in less than 10 seconds on a thursday 
at 137 pm not long after workers had returned from lunch 
within hours an army of volunteers many of them workers from 
construction jobs around booming connecticut gathered at the site 
of what was to have been a 16story apartment building near 
downtown 
floodlights were set up for the roundtheclock rescue effort 
the families of missing men waited in a nearby school and the 
salvation army set up canteens to serve the rescue workers and 
relatives 
in the first few days hopes remained high that someone would be 
pulled alive from the wreckage sensitive microphones designed for 
searches in mining accidents were used to hunt for signs of life in 
the rubble but nine days later the last body was removed 
jonathan best bridgeports director of emergency medical 
services said the city carried on the nations biggest rescue 
ever the 73 million effort included 4000 workers 30 ambulance 
services 500 emergency medical services workers and 700 bottles 
of oxygen 
ive been to plane crashes bombings and subway fires and 
ive never seen people as badly injured as i did then best said 
best 33 said he tried to shield people from the gruesomeness 
of the search for bodies and recoveries only he and four others 
removed the body parts 
at one point best said he and the four others needed 
professional help but a social worker listened to them for a few 
minutes and lost it so we had to have him removed best said 
counseling was offered to the rescue workers but it could not 
mitigate all the effects of the disaster 
best said his ems staff has had a 50 percent attrition rate 
since the collapse one paramedic quit on the scene after she not 
knowing she was talking to the father of a high school student 
working on his spring vacation abruptly told him the boy was dead 
last october federal investigators concluded that the collapse 
was triggered by a bracket that bent under heavy pressure and the 
us department of labor assessed a record 511 million in fines 
against contractors 
it also led to congressional hearings in washington that 
examined the work of the us occupational safety and health 
administration the justice department is considering a request by 
the labor department that criminal charges be brought against one 
contractor 
in connecticut prosecutors decided not to press criminal 
charges 
the pages and other victims families have filed lawsuits 
against the city the owners of the project and a subcontractor 
that performed the liftslab construction technique more lawsuits 
are expected 
pages father lowell was silent during a recent interview in 
the familys home he sat staring at lottery tickets in his hand 
but when talk turned to the collapse tears welled up in his eyes 
pages brother lowell also a construction worker said john did 
not feel comfortable at the site 
he was pulled off another job to go there because they had to 
meet their quotas to make sure so much work was done so they could 
get paid the brother said 
he was just a gentle boy mrs page said i wish hed 
never gone into construction

the house has voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
finding more drugfighting money within current budget limits but 
democratic leaders said they would raise the limits if president 
reagan agrees 
the house voted 4120 on wednesday to oppose a senate initiative 
to expand the war on drugs by increasing the spending and tax 
limits in the budget agreement between the president and 
congressional leaders 
the republicansponsored motion instructed house budget 
negotiators to insist the drug war be waged within the domestic 
spending constraints guiding the 11 trillion fiscal 1989 spending 
blueprint now in a housesenate conference committee 
it would be far more easy and more dramatic to raise spending 
and taxes for the war on drugs said rep william thomas 
rcalif who offered the motion but this is absolutely the 
wrong time to abandon that budget pact framework 
the senate in passing its version of the fiscal 1989 budget 
last week added a 26 billion trust fund above current spending 
limitations that could be tapped if the president and congress 
declared drugs a dire emergency 
president reagan had proposed and both the house and senate 
budgets already included increases in drug enforcement and 
education a popular issue in an election year 
the senate however added the amendment to increase the funding 
further sponsors said that could be financed through tougher 
enforcement of tax laws and government debt collections 
house budget committee chairman william h gray iii dpa said 
he had no objections to the nonbinding action but he said the 
budget pact left room for changes if the leaders and the president 
decided there were a dire emergency 
and house speaker jim wright dtexas told reporters wednesday 
he would favor raising the budget agreements spending caps for 
fighting the drug problem if the reagan administration agreed 
treasury secretary james a baker iii told a senate subcommittee 
last week that the government should cut other spending if it 
wanted to increase the drug effort but he did not rule out 
reopening the budget summit if the president and the others agreed

once again president reagan may face what he 
says is his saddest task comforting the families of american 
servicemen lost in the line of duty 
he has had to do a lot of it 
more than 300 american servicemen have lost their lives in 
combat or to terrorists overseas since reagan took office in 
january 1981 
by contrast the only servicemen who died in the line of duty 
during the four years jimmy carter was president were the eight 
killed when a helicopter collided with a transport plane during the 
abortive attempt in april 1980 to rescue the americans held hostage 
in iran 
the latest us military involvement in the persian gulf may 
have added to the current toll the white house said wednesday the 
navy has abandoned its search for a marine helicopter that 
disappeared monday over the gulf the pilot and copilot were 
declared missing 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan might call 
the relatives of the missing crewmen although he knew of no 
immediate plans to do so 
in an interview in february asked what his greatest regrets 
were about his presidency reagan spoke of calls that have had to 
be made to families who have lost someone and said those are 
things for which you have to be very sorry 
asked whether the contrast between the reagan and carter figures 
is the fruit of a belligerent posture by reagan joshua m epstein 
a research associate in foreign policy studies at the brookings 
institute said its a tough question 
its hard to know what another administration would have done 
under the circumstances said epstein author of defense studies 
including an analysis of us strategy and force planning in the 
persian gulf 
reagan who came to office charging that carter had weakened 
america and vowing to regain respect abroad with a stern policy 
toward potential foes has sometimes raised hackles in congress 
with his bristling rhetoric and his acts to back it up 
critics charged that he failed to think through the reasons for 
sending us marines to lebanon where 241 service personnel died 
in an attack on a marine barracks on oct 23 1983 the marines 
were later withdrawn 
many in congress also questioned the rationale for the us 
invasion of grenada on oct 25 1983 just two days later by the 
state departments count 19 americans were killed and 112 wounded 
in the threeday invasion 
reagan of course disagrees 
of the marine peacekeeping force in lebanon he said in a 
february interview with the washington post that the terrible 
thing was that they were actually succeeding in their mission and 
thats why the violence was turned on them 
and he said of the grenada invasion i cant help but be 
proud that there is an island now down in the caribbean where there 
arent any signs yankee go home but where somebody sent me a 
postcard the other day a photograph of a wall painted with 
all kinds of graffiti about god love the usa 
other killings of american servicemen abroad in recent years 
have included 
an april 1983 bombing of the american embassy in beirut in 
which five servicemen and 12 other americans were killed 
a september 1984 bombing of the same embassy that killed two 
marine guards 
the us bombing raid on suspected terrorist facilities in 
libya on april 14 1986 in which one air force f111 and its 
twoman crew were lost 
an iraqi missile attack on the us frigate stark in the 
persian gulf on may 17 1987 killing 37 sailors

the old guard of the nevada republican party 
is on the outside looking in as the gop readies for a state 
convention controlled by supporters of former television evangelist 
pat robertson 
convention preliminaries start here today with meetings of 
platform credential resolution and bylaws committees and 600 to 
650 delegates at least twothirds of them robertson supporters 
should be on hand when the general session convenes friday 
the republicans will adopt whats expected to be a generally 
conservative platform at the convention ending saturday and also 
complete the process of picking a 20member delegation to the 
national gop convention this summer in new orleans 
at least 16 of those national convention delegates will be 
robertson delegates and even though vice president george bush is 
continuing to roll toward the republican presidential nomination 
robertsons nevada coordinator says its possible the entire nevada 
delegation could be for robertson 
its also possible that such nevada gop luminaries as national 
party chairman frank fahrenkopf jr rep barbara vucanovich 
former sen paul laxalt and others wont be on the 20member 
delegation to new orleans 
by the time the state convention ends this weekend all top 
party offices could be filled by a solid slate of robertson 
supporters among them robertson coordinator steve wark who is the 
only announced candidate for state republican party chairman 
wark says he wouldnt have sought the chairmanship if the 
incumbent sally vitkusmckinney of las vegas hadnt decided to 
bow out he also says his first effort will be to make party 
regulars feel welcome instead of ousted 
were not taking a cavalier attitude he says this is an 
evolutionary process of party politics we desperately dont 
want anyone to feel that theyve been kicked out they havent 
been 
on the other hand says wark if pat robertson thought it was 
important to have all 20 nevada delegates to the national 
convention it would be that 
robertson is to address the state convention friday the same 
day fahrenkopf speaks 
besides wark the other robertson supporters who are candidates 
for various state gop offices include judy cresenta of reno for 
national committeewoman and leonard saye of las vegas for national 
committeeman

the army will soon begin firing up to 2600 
civilian workers around the country but remains optimistic 
congress will help avoid furloughs for up to 150000 more a top 
general says 
maj gen james f mccall the armys budget director said 
wednesday in an interview the service would have to reduce its 
civilian workforce from 412000 to 400000 by oct 1 the start of 
the 1989 fiscal year 
that reduction is part of a cut in strength ordered by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to meet the terms of a 
deficitreduction agreement with congress last fall 
you cant get those 12000 people down solely by way of hiring 
freezes reductions in temporary workers and early outs the 
twostar general said 
although the number of layoffs needed is still subject to 
change the current estimate is about 2500 to 2600 
reductionsinforce to get 12000 people off the rolls 
mccall said 
the pentagon disclosed in its fiscal 1989 budget plan last 
february that all the services would face reductions in civilian 
employment and that all but the navy would see actual cuts in 
military strength as well 
the army has said it will slash 8600 activeduty positions this 
year to reach a new level of 772300 mccalls comments are the 
first to detail the precise impact on the civilian side 
the general indicated it would be premature to discuss the 
number of layoffs being planned at individual army facilities but 
said there were 25 to 30 bases around the country that would face 
civilian cuts 
he said the dismissals were designed to meet the spending target 
set for the next fiscal year they must be implemented soon because 
the service must start fiscal 1989 on oct 1 at the reduced 
employment level 
cuts to this years budget however are equally severe and 
furloughs of civilian workers will be required this summer if 
congress doesnt approve a legislative proposal submitted within 
the past month 
that bill would provide the defense department with expanded 
authority to transfer funds among different accounts and to carry 
certain funds over from year to year mccall said 
we have had indications from at least five army commands 
that without any relief they would need to furlough to maintain 
their level of readiness the general said 
that furlough in its worst case would be as high as 
150000 people for varying lengths of time from three to 15 
days 
mccall said he is optimistic congress will grant the flexibility 
to avoid furloughs because the pentagon is not asking for an extra 
appropriation 
congress must act by june however if the army is to avoid the 
huge furloughs that would be needed to help make up for a 28 
billion cut to its original request of 213 billion for operations 
and maintenance spending this year 
roughly 70 percent of all the armys civilian workers are paid 
from that account which also holds the money for readiness 
training for the active force mccall said

former federal aviation administration chief 
donald d engen says the agency must be given more independence 
saying needed safety rules were bogged down in the bureaucracy 
during his tenure 
getting some regulations approved by the department of 
transportation was like a maddening shell and pea game engen 
told the senate aviation subcommittee wednesday 
some safety rules could be tied up for months because of the 
slowness of the department he said the answer is to remove the 
faa from the department he said as the presidential aviation 
safety commission recommended monday 
rules for a technical field such as aviation must be timely 
he told lawmakers safety is often at issue and additional dot 
requirements in the laborious rulemaking process can subvert the 
goal of safety from a timeliness as well as a technical accuracy 
standpoint 
engens comments clashed with transportation secretary james h 
burnley iv who told the same subcommittee last month that to get 
regulations out of faa it has been necessary to use the 
bureaucratic equivalent of a cattle prod 
although engen has been critical before of the transportation 
departments handling of faa proposals he has not been as 
expansive nor has he previously directly clashed with a department 
official 
transportation department officials at the hearing wednesday 
rejected engens contentions and gave reporters documents they 
said challenged some of the claims he made 
engen left his job july 2 for what he called personal reasons 
asked by a reporter whether his complaints to the subcommittee 
had prompted his departure engen said youll have to draw that 
conclusion not me 
the former administrator and dot officials also sparred over 
events surrounding decisions engen said he made 
in one instance engen told the panel he blocked the boeing co 
from removing two of the 10 emergency exits on its 747 jetliners to 
add extra seats engen said he rejected the manufacturers request 
because it would have been less safe for passengers he also said 
the transportation department was strangely silent while the 
matter was being decided 
there was no waffling no coziness between government and 
industry he said 
but transportation department spokesman bob marx gave a reporter 
a copy of an aug 6 1985 letter from thentransportation 
secretary elizabeth h dole to rep major owens dny stating 
that at my request engen was pursuing the issue 
a june 10 1985 letter to mrs dole from henry a duffy 
president of the air line pilots association expressed our 
disappointment and concern regarding admiral engens endorsement of 
the overwing emergency exit deactivation on boeing 747 aircraft 
the letter asked mrs dole to block faa approval of the plan

some congressmen are urging the reagan 
administration to have the us navy extend its protection in the 
persian gulf to randomly chosen ships not flying the american flag 
the purpose is to keep any attacker off guard off balance 
sen john warner the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said in todays editions of the washington post 
warner of virginia said such a policy would deter attacks 
because aggressors would not be sure if their actions might draw 
fire from the united states no advance notice would be given of 
which ships would receive protection 
unidentified administration officials quoted by the post said 
the white house is considering the broadened role in the gulf 
following us attacks this week on iranian oil platforms that 
brought violent retaliation attempts from irans navy 
congressmen have expressed concern about the us role in the 
gulf where american warships protect kuwaiti tankers flying the 
us flag 
senate armed services chairman sam nunn dga has suggested 
the united states could maintain a more neutral appearance in the 
iraniraq war if the gulf were divided into zones with each one 
protected by a different nations navy 
the congressional research service told a house panel wednesday 
that americas allies are doing more than is publicly perceived to 
help protect the flow of oil in the persian gulf 
five european nations and the japanese have all increased their 
persian gulf efforts in the past 12 months to try to meet the 
threat posed by the iraniraq war said stanley sloan a crs 
analyst 
sloans assessment differed from the view of rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo who said the public believes the allies should 
do more in the troubled region 
schroeder chairs the house armed services panel on allied 
burdensharing which has been looking at help provided by us 
allies 
sloan told the house panel there has been substantial 
evolution of allied attitudes toward their military role in the 
persian gulf in the past year that change came after the us 
navy began escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
great britain france italy belgium and the netherlands sent 
additional naval contingents to the persian gulf region to 
demonstrate that they appreciate the threat of instability in that 
region to western interests sloan noted 
in addition japan took a number of steps even though that 
nation is prohibited by its americanwritten constitution from 
military operations far beyond its shores 
japan offered to buy a 10 million navigation system for the 
arab nations of the persian gulf region announced that it would 
increase economic aid to jordan and oman by 500 million and said 
it was willing to contribute to united nations peace efforts in 
the region sloan said

imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted 
together without any fuselage in the center the air force says 
thats the general shape of the new stealth bomber 
piercing a decade of official secrecy the air force on 
wednesday released an artists drawing of its newest strategic 
bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later 
this fall 
the service also acknowledged the program was suffering some 
cost overruns and that a new estimate would have to be released 
later this year 
some cost growth is to be expected in any development program 
that is on the leading edge of technology like the b2 the air 
force said using the bombers official military designation 
but the acquisition of the b2 ensures our capability to 
effectively penetrate soviet defenses well into the 21st century 
the stealth bomber is so named because it is designed to fly 
without showing up on radar while the air force has flatly refused 
to discuss the bomber since design work began in the 1970s its 
general shape has actually been known since 1985 when former 
arizona sen barry goldwater disclosed its resemblance to a 
flying wing 
the drawing distributed by the air force wednesday shows an 
airplane that to some extent resembles a boomerang a small cockpit 
rises in the middle on top and inlets for the jet engines are 
placed to each side of the cockpit also on top of the wing 
the design allows the aircraft to be made without any sharp or 
right angles according to pentagon sources the plane also relies 
on the use of radarabsorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and 
composite materials for construction 
the design has long been the object of experimentation by the 
northrop corp which is building the b2 for the air force the 
company flew a propellerdriven version of such a plane known as 
the xb35 in 1946 
a jetpowered version the yb49 first flew in late 1947 and 
was tested by the air force but the service never purchased any of 
the planes and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the 
early 1950s 
the air force declined wednesday to give a precise date for the 
maiden flight saying only that it would occur this fall and 
involve a short hop from the manufacturing plant at palmdale 
calif to edwards air force base calif 
as the first flight approaches many actions associated with 
preparations for that flight can best be accomplished in the open 
without compromising program security the service said in 
explaining its relaxation of secrecy 
details of such things as performance characteristics crew size 
and maximum payload remain classified however the air force said 
indeed some of the details about the planes design for example 
the placement of the engine exhaust outlets have been 
deliberately masked in the artists rendering service sources said 
the air force did acknowledge however the plane is going to 
cost more than originally projected 
while the acquisition of 132 b2 bombers was originally 
estimated to cost 366 billion in 1981 dollars the air force is 
reevaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current 
and projected fiscal constraints the service said 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee lauded the air force for releasing more information 
about the plane saying the public needs to learn about a 
revolutionary addition to our nuclear deterrent 
he predicted the bomber will render obsolete billions of 
dollars of soviet investment in their current air defense

a coalition of local environmental groups 
wants congress to create an aquafund to clean up harbors and 
waterways that are toxic hot spots 
a report released wednesday by dozens of organizations from new 
england to california said the program should be modeled on the 
governments superfund program which is designed to locate and 
clean up toxic waste sites on land 
our waterways can only be as clean as their container the 
coalition said in the report issued to lawmakers 
the aquafund proposal and other recommendations came out of an 
october conference to set a national agenda for the clean up of 
americas bays sounds and the great lakes said trudy coxe 
executive director of save the bay of rhode island and head of the 
national conference 
were trying to tell you that our bays are worth protecting 
and fighting for ms coxe told a dozen lawmakers gathered at a 
conference to discuss the report 
americas coastal waters are dying and we need to take action 
now or lose a critical economic resource she said we refuse 
to endure another summer of coastal horror stories where dolphins 
and diseased fish and shellfish are pulled from our marine waters 
environmentalists called the october conference sponsored in 
part by the environmental protection agency the first of its kind 
for coastal activists and the report the first national coastal 
agenda 
david j miller executive director of great lakes united said 
the problem of toxic sediments has become enormous 
he said polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs found in new bedford 
harbor in massachusetts and the great lakes and heavy metals in 
the chesapeake bay san francisco bay and puget sound have 
contaminated fish and limit public use 
the proposed aquafund would create a national priority list to 
identify the toxic hot spots and fund their clean up epa now 
only regulates water quality not the sediments on the floors of 
bays and waterways miller said 
ms coxe did not put a price tag on the program saying only it 
would be a multimultimillion dollar project 
the report also called for limiting or eliminating federal 
subsidies that environmentalists say encourage pollution the group 
targeted the national flood insurance program saying it promotes 
development of fragile coastal areas 
the report also called for tougher environmental laws and more 
stringent enforcement and a program to protect surviving wetlands 
and restore at least 10 percent of the wetlands already lost 
preventing the pollution of our coastal waters and cleaning up 
the damage that has already been done are ambitious but absolutely 
essential goals said sen john h chafee rri the 
recommendations put forth deserve widespread circulation and 
consideration

junior high school students rallied around 
a student who has tested positive for the aids virus shouting down 
a small group protesting his admission to the school 
go home students yelled at the eight people protesting 
12yearold dewayne mowerys attendance at clinton junior high 
school 
police twice had to separate the eight protesters from about 200 
angry students and parents 
wanda webber whose son is a ninthgrader slammed on her brakes 
and got out of her car to deride the protesters as disgusting 
members of the group do not know what they are talking 
about she said they are shaming the town they are shaming 
this community they are showing the whole world how ignorant they 
are 
ignorance and petty fear that scares me more than aids she 
said 
dewayne was the center of protests last year when he tried to 
enter lake city middle school an incident that led to his 
testimony before the presidential aids commission earlier this year 
in nashville 
health officials have said that dewayne who has shown no 
symptoms of the syndrome apparently contracted the virus from a 
clotting factor he uses in treatment for hemophilia the substance 
is made from a blood component 
the schools staff members students and parents have attended 
special classes organized by the principal harold heath to learn 
about aids and hemophilia which is characterized by uncontrolled 
bleeding 
the students are probably the most informed group of 
7th8thand 9thgraders in the country on what this boy has what 
it can do and how it can be transmitted heath said 
our science teachers have done a fantastic job he said 
these kids are equipped with a lot of information 
during lunch tuesday several students erected signs on the 
school grounds saying dewayne is not hurting us you are 
parents get educated innocence cant kill ignorance can 
welcome to cjhs dewayne and dont be ignorant get the 
facts 
another sign said fight with facts rumors spread faster than 
aids near the end of the school day students gathered to yell 
go home at the protesters 
last fall dewaynes parents pulled him out of lake city middle 
school after they said they had received threats after removing 
him he had been taking classes alone at a special school

attorney general edwin meese iii says he may 
appoint an acting deputy while the search continues for someone to 
fill the no 2 slot in his embattled justice department after two 
people have rejected the post 
the position is being vacated friday by deputy attorney general 
arnold burns who resigned in protest march 29 out of concern that 
the nearly yearlong criminal investigation of meese was hurting 
department operations 
meeses latest choice former american bar association president 
john shepherd said wednesday he was concerned with the personal 
and financial sacrifices required of him and his family for the 
brief appointment 
my wife and i were not prepared for the pressures to which 
someone recommended for this position at this time would be 
subject shepherd said 
meese had hurriedly announced shepherd would be his choice april 
5 in a bid by the attorney general to assert his leadership at the 
department 
minutes after the announcement that shepherd was withdrawing 
meese told a senate appropriations subcommittee he would appoint an 
acting deputy he later told reporters he did not rule out the 
possibility of appointing his counselor william bradford reynolds 
the senate three years ago refused to confirm reynolds as 
associate attorney general the no 3 post in the department 
because of reynolds handling of civil rights 
meese later refined his remarks with department spokesman terry 
eastland saying no decision has been made on whether to appoint an 
acting deputy and no thought given to who might fill the job in the 
interim if it were deemed necessary 
the deputy attorney general manages daytoday operations at the 
department and handles matters from which the attorney general has 
removed himself in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest 
the no 3 justice department post also is vacant with the 
departure of associate attorney general stephen trott to become a 
federal judge 
meese has chosen assistant treasury secretary francis keating to 
succeed trott but he wont join the department until he is 
nominated by president reagan 
that leaves solicitor general charles fried as the highest 
ranking official in the department after meese the solicitor 
general represents the government before the supreme court 
in burns office five of the six deputies are leaving and in 
trotts office all but one of the deputies have left 
another key post that meese is trying to fill is criminal 
division chief left vacant by the march 29 protest resignation of 
assistant attorney general william weld who stepped down at the 
same time as burns a number of us attorneys have rejected 
overtures by aides to meese to replace weld 
shepherd withdrew his name in the face of mounting publicity 
about an alleged affair with his bookkeeper 
there were also disclosures that longtime meese friend e robert 
wallach now under indictment in the wedtech scandal had 
recommended shepherd to meese for a justice department post in 1984 
or 1985 and that shepherd belongs to an allwhite country club and 
an allmale social club 
the st louis postdispatch reported wednesday that its 
investigation determined that the woman who alleged the affair 
denise sinner made up nearly every portion of her background 
shepherd was meeses second choice to fill the post 
philadelphia lawyer arlin adams rejected meeses overtures earlier 
this month saying he had a heavy caseload at his law firm 
also on wednesday meese reiterated there was no connection 
between a building lease signed by the department and the 
arrangement for a foundation to pay his wifes salary at the 
multiple sclerosis society 
the associated press reported last week that the justice 
department signed a 50 million lease on the bulding owned in part 
by howard m bender after his familys foundation routed money to 
the multiple sclerosis society for ursula meeses 40000ayear 
job 
meese called the story an outrageous and scurrilous attack 
he said an attempt to discredit him through his wife was the 
lowest form of journalism 
meese said the benders made a charitable contribution and did 
not pay mrs meeses salary 
james bierbower the societys attorney told the ap mrs meese 
was hired only after the bender foundation made available 40000 
for a development director for operation job match a program that 
finds positions for handicapped people 
bierbower said ms officials and trustees decided in late 1985 to 
hire a development director for the job match program mrs meese 
was the person ms officials wanted to fill the position he said 
thereafter the officers were able to make arrangements 
that the bender foundation would fund the position for 1986 with a 
40000 grant and that mrs meese would be hired as development 
director he said 
the ms society successfully solicited an additional 40000 
grant from the bender foundation to keep mrs meese on the payroll 
in 1987 the society has a commitment from the foundation to pay 
40000 in 1988 for her salary but the check has yet to be 
received he said

a minor everyday stress like public speaking can 
be as damaging to the heart as strenuous exercise in people who 
have cardiac disease and even can trigger heart attacks according 
to research published today 
the researchers found that the common stresses can cause silent 
ischemia a painless but ominous disruption in the flow of blood to 
the hearts own muscle 
the study shows that previously unrecognized mental activities 
have very important consequences said dr carl j pepine of the 
university of florida 
it also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiac problem 
only for people with heart disease not those those with healthy 
hearts 
the chief author of the study recommended that people suspected 
of having heart disease those who smoke or have high blood 
pressure high cholesterol or a family history of heart trouble 
should be checked for this condition so they can be treated 
when silent ischemia is discovered during routine tests people 
can be treated with medicines coronary bypass surgery or 
angioplasty a common procedure that uses balloons to open up 
clogged heart arteries 
nothing should come out of this work about what patients 
should or shouldnt be doing in their daily lives said the lead 
researcher dr alan rozanski of cedarssinai medical center in los 
angeles i think people should exercise and you cant go around 
worrying about mental stress 
if ischemia lasts for more than 20 or 30 minutes the 
oxygenstarved section of the heart dies resulting in a heart 
attack although the crisis usually passes in a few minutes without 
permanent damage it may be a warning of more serious heart 
problems to come 
in their study published in the new england journal of 
medicine rozanski and colleagues studied 39 heart patients and 12 
healthy people while the men and women did a series of mildly 
stressful mental exercises the doctors used a common diagnostic 
procedure called nuclear cardiology to watch their beating hearts 
they found that a variety of mental gymnastics such as 
repeatedly subtracting seven from a fourdigit number could 
trigger ischemia the worst was asking people to give a fiveminute 
talk about their personal faults and bad habits in front of two 
observers 
it really brings home the notion that silent ischemia doesnt 
just occur at extreme levels of exercise or in the highest risk 
patients said dr sidney gottlieb of johns hopkins university 
these are everyday patients who are doing quite well with 
coronary disease who with minor levels of stress are having 
significant amounts of ischemia 
rozanski noted that while the stress of hard exercise often 
caused pain mental stress rarely did 
our study indicates a mechanism by which mental stress could 
induce ischemia which if prolonged could lead to heart attack 
he said 
dr andrew p selwyn of brigham and womens hospital in boston 
has reached similar conclusions he equipped heart patients with 
portable electrocardiogram machines and matched their episodes of 
ischemia with what they were doing less than a quarter of them 
occurred during exercise 
in an editorial in the journal selwyn said that the arteries of 
people with heart disease apparently fail to expand and contract 
properly in reaction to stress when healthy peoples hearts need 
more blood their arteries open up to increase the flow 
however when the arteries are clogged with fatty desposits the 
opposite seems to occur they respond to physical or mental stress 
by squeezing tight

three defendants in the irancontra case say 
the judge made a mockery of their rights by devising woefully 
inadequate procedures to determinine if prosecutors illegally 
used their congressional testimony 
in an unusually harsh attack defense attorneys challenged the 
procedures us district judge gerhard a gesell adopted for a 
hearing on whether prosecutors took evidence from the compelled 
congressional testimony of lt col oliver l north former 
national security adviser john m poindexer and businessman albert 
hakim 
the lawyers asked gesell to reconsider his denial of their 
requests to question individual grand jurors and witnesses to 
determine if independent counsel lawrence e walshs investigation 
was tainted by exposure to the congressional testimony of north 
poindexter and hakim 
the procedure for next mondays hearing makes a mockery of the 
orders of the united states district court for the district of 
columbia compelling defendants testimony before congress the 
defense said in a brief filed wednesday 
defense attorneys threatened to file an appeal they also asked 
gesell to postpone the hearing while he reconsiders how to conduct 
it 
the procedures established by the order for determining 
whether or not there has been or will be any direct or indirect use 
of defendants immunized testimony are woefully inadequate the 
defense said 
the three defendants are charged with conspiring to illegally 
divert to nicaraguan rebels some of the profits from the sale of 
us arms to iran 
a fourth defendant retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord gave congressional testimony without the socalled use 
immunity 
at a hearing last week gesell rejected defense requests for a 
wideranging inquiry into walshs investigative methods and 
procedures 
but the judge ordered walsh to tell the court what steps he took 
to insulate his staff and the grand jury from the extensive 
publicity surrounding the defendants testimony on capitol hill 
gesell also invited the defense if it could to produce a grand 
jury witness who changed his story after hearing congressional 
testimony 
we think we can draw blood fairly quickly barry simon one 
of norths lawyers told gesell at the hearing 
the latest motion was filed a day before todays deadline for 
the defense to give walsh the name of the witness it plans to call 
at next mondays proceeding 
lawyers for the three defendants contend that publicity of last 
years congressional hearings made it impossible for walsh to 
shield his staff and grand jurors from the testimony some of which 
was given under the condition that it could not be used against 
them in criminal prosecution 
certainly common sense tells us that there is vitually no 
prospective witness in this case who has not been exposed to and 
to some degree influenced by defendants immunized testimony 
the joint defense motion said 
this case is an omelet from which the tainted immunized 
testimony can never be unscrambled attorneys brendan v sullivan 
jr richard w beckler and n richard janis said in the motion 
gesell has said he would dismiss the case if walsh fails to 
prove he didnt use evidence from the defendants congressional 
testimony 
but the defense said the judges methods for making that finding 
appear designed to ensure that any dismissal of the indictment 
will only follow a protracted trial with its grave risks to our 
national security and its inherent financial and emotional trauma 
both for the defendants and for the nation 
the judge has indicated he would like to start the trial in 
july while the defense wants to delay the proceeding until next 
year

for more than a decade algeria has 
played a central role in mediating hostage crises 
on wednesday it achieved another success negotiating a 
peaceful end to the hijacking of a kuwait airways jetliner 
neither algeria nor kuwait provided any details of the deal that 
ended the hijacking setting free the 31 remaining hostages 
but some evidence indicates the outlines of the deal that 
kuwaits official news agency said assured the nine hijackers safe 
passage to tehran or beirut may have been worked out in cyprus more 
than a week ago 
interior minister hedi khediri asked about the fate of the 
hijackers replied that is strictly algerias affair 
the hijackers had demanded that kuwait release 17 proiranian 
terrorists jailed for the 1983 bombings of us and french 
embassies in kuwait kuwait steadfastly refused 
algeria was criticized for striking deals in the 1970s the 
world media dubbed the nation a sanctuary for hijackers and 
for a while it adopted a policy of not accepting hijacked planes 
but in 1981 the north african nation gained prestige for 
mediating the release of the american hostages held in the us 
embassy in iran 
algeria also was involved in negotiations that led to the end of 
the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner with 145 people aboard the 
hijackers had killed a us navy diver 
the nonaligned nation is a strong believer in secret 
negotiations and in mediations it adheres to another countrys 
wishes to the letter 
khediri declined to disclose any details of the bargaining in 
the kuwaiti hijacking which began april 5 on a flight from bangkok 
to kuwait 
before the plane landed in algiers from larnaca on april 13 
cypriot officials told reporters it was allowed to take off only 
because algeria had given formal assurance all the hostages would 
be released 
the hijackers had killed two passengers in larnaca 
algeria promptly denied the claim apparently to avoid arousing 
the suspicion of the hijackers in delicate maneuvering at algiers 
airport 
aided by the revolutionary credentials it gained in its bitter 
eightyear war of independence with france algeria is well placed 
among moslem countries in mediating between moderate governments 
and fundamentalist islamic extremists 
in this case it set up a toplevel negotiating committee 
personally supervised by khediri and divided into two teams one 
for contacts with the kuwaitis and the other for liaison with the 
gunmen 
algerian officials shuttled seemingly unperturbed between the 
two sides 
khediri himself was the first algerian to board the plane on 
april 13 after talking to the hijackers for 30 minutes he 
announced they had promised to refrain from all violence while on 
algerian territory 
various algerian negotiators went to and from the plane day and 
night for six days several times hooded hijackers climbed down 
from the plane to talk to algerian negotiators in a sovietbuilt 
yellow niva hatchback car 
when the hijackers had something new to say they would call on 
the jets radio yellow car please 
when the algerians wanted to talk to the hijackers or send them 
a message they would ask can the yellow car come to the plane 
please 
extreme politeness was observed in all these exchanges there 
was never any discussion of substantive issues since conversations 
with the control tower were monitored by reporters the yellow car 
was the negotiating vehicle 
when the hostages finally emerged from the plane at 6 am 
wednesday the hijackers were gone

gary ballard 
marksmen stood by with tranquilizer guns in case the tiger got 
loose a police swat team also stood by

hes upset man hes going to be all right vargas said 
after cezar surrendered 
cezar was booked on firstdegree robbery criminal mischief and

six vessels sunk or crippled in clashes with the us navy in the 
persian gulf 
iraq fired missiles at four iranian cities on wednesday then 
offered to stop its missile attacks at midnight if iran did the 
same the unofficial truce apparently held on both sides through 
the early morning hours today 
before the truce began iran fired a missile at kuwait that 
reportedly exploded near a usrun oilfield 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in

the frigate went to general quarters the navys highest alert 
officers said the alert was a precaution against the possibility 
that the aircraft could have dropped a canister of cs riot control 
gas in the area there was no indication the plane had taken any 
such action

doctors believe they can ultimately save babies 
lives by selectively destroying some fetuses while sparing others 
in the same womb but one ethics expert calls it a tragic 
practice 
the procedure has been performed in women who are pregnant with 
several fetuses often as a result of fertility drugs or testtube 
fertilizations 
the chances are slim that four or more fetuses would survive and 
be healthy so the strategy is to terminate all but two of them in 
a procedure called selective reduction the two remaining 
fetuses face reasonably good odds of growing to be healthy normal 
infants 
in patients who choose to undergo selective reduction during 
the first trimester the procedure may offer an option to save the 
lives of a number of desperately wanted infants wrote dr 
richard l berkowitz and colleagues from mount sinai school of 
medicine in new york 
their report published in todays new england journal of 
medicine describes the use of the procedure in 12 pregnancies 
seven of the women had healthy twins while one had a healthy 
single baby four others had no liveborn infants 
they also acknowledged however that selective reduction raises 
important ethical questions others agreed 
in an editorial in the journal dr john c hobbins of yale 
medical school said that even those who think abortion is sometimes 
justified must wrestle with the concept of sacrificing some 
fetuses so that others can survive 
the rev richard mccormick a roman catholic priest who teaches 
moral theology at notre dame said in an interview that in the 
vast majority of cases that is morally wrong 
mccormick said the procedure is morally acceptable only after 
accidents such as inadvertant overdoses of fertility drugs that 
result in so many fetuses that none is likely to survive 
a case can be made for doing it when its the only lifesaving 
alternative available mccormick said even then everybody 
feels chilly about it 
arthur caplan a medical ethics expert at the university of 
minnesota called it a tragic practice and a very sad 
intervention 
doctors who perform testtube fertilizations often implant 
several embryos in hopes that one will survive but sometimes more 
may grow 
caplan said doctors who perform these fertilizations should 
implant no more than four embryos so that they minimize the risk of 
multiple fetuses and physicians also should be careful to 
prescribe the minimum effective dose of fertility drugs 
once you are stuck in a situation its morally defensible to 
do it he said of selective reduction but you should do 
everything you can to avoid that situation 
in his report berkowitz noted that in the past couples have 
had only two choices take their chances on a successful outcome or 
abort the entire pregnancy 
however he said the decision to have selective reduction is 
also hard for parents anxious to have babies it should only be 
done if they are prepared to lose the entire pregnancy 
in the 12 cases described the doctors selectively destroyed all 
but two fetuses in each woman in most cases this was done by 
injecting potassium chloride into the fetal hearts of those who 
received the procedure two of the women had each conceived six 
fetuses one had five five had four and four were carrying 
triplets 
berkowitz said that women who carry four or more fetuses are 
ideal candidates for the approach because of the high risk of 
complications however triplets are in a gray area and present 
an enormous dilemma for both the patients and their physicians 
he said it should not be done with twins since chances are good 
that both will develop to be healthy babies

come november nbc might not abide by its 
handshake agreement with congress not to project a winner in the 
presidential election until all polls have closed 
nbc news president lawrence k grossman said wednesday he is 
uncomfortable with the agreement which was elicited by 
sponsors of legislation to establish a nationwide uniform poll 
closing time 
were very concerned about it and well reevaluate it before 
the election in november if theres no progress made on the poll 
closing bill grossman said wednesday 
nbcs decision could put pressure on the two other networks to 
abandon the policy stated in an informal agreement with congress 
as part of a push for a uniform national poll closing time 
meantime nbc is abiding by the policy although nbc nightly 
news anchor tom brokaw said tuesday night during coverage of the 
new york primary almost two hours before polls closed that 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis may well be headed for 
victory 
nightly news has been making similar statements about trends 
in races throughout the primary season 
abcs peter jennings and cbs dan rather both said tuesday night 
during their broadcasts that they could not predict the election 
because polls were still open in new york the polls closed at 9 
pm 
nbcs report followed a local wnbctv newscast predicting 
dukakis as the winner statewide and jesse jackson as carrying new 
york city 
grossman insisted the nbc report did not violate the agreement 
with congress because it wasnt technically a projection 
in a 1985 letter to rep al swift dwash grossman like his 
counterparts at abc and cbs vowed nbc would not use the exit 
poll data we gather to suggest the probable winner in any state 
until polls in that state have closed 
the letter was part of an agreement sought by swift and rep 
william thomas rcalif to help their legislation proposing a 
uniform poll closing time in presidential election years 
swift criticized nbcs tuesday evening report for not being true 
to the spirit of network policy however one might argue the 
letter of it swift said in a statement 
he praised abc and cbs for explicitly stating that they would 
not make a prediction until the polls closed 
it is my hope that this is just an error and that nbc news 
will reaffirm its policy and that the other news operations will 
not see this incident as cause to abandon their policy or 
practice swift said 
its a very frustrating situation said tom bettag 
executive producer of the cbs evening news 
i think somebodys got to seriously rethink how this all 
works it is very frustrating to be in the position we were in last 
night knowing that your opposition has for weeks been 
characterizing elections its a very uncomfortable position to be 
in 
by the time the networks go on the air they usually have exit 
polling data upon which they could accurately predict the outcome 
of the election release of such information theoretically 
disenfranchises voters still waiting to cast votes in a 
presidential election polls in western states are still open after 
polls on the east coast and in the midwest have closed 
ironically it was not the networks but thenpresident jimmy 
carter who sparked the most controversy when in 1980 he conceded 
the presidential election to ronald reagan before polls on the west 
coast had closed

associated press reporters were taken on a tour 
of the faw peninsula by the iraqi military and filed the following 
report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jubilant iraqi soldiers chanted slogans and 
waved their rifles before a mural of irans ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini to celebrate the recapture of this shellblasted town at 
iraqs southern tip 
faw lay battered and virtually unpopulated around them its 
walls still marked with murals of iranian leaders and slogans in 
irans farsi tongue 
but iraqs seizure this week of the dusty windswept town two 
years after iran captured it was probably iraqs most important 
offensive victory since the war began in september 1980 
by the time reporters visited wednesday evening iraqi forces 
who had stormed the desolate battleground on sunday appeared to 
have driven iranian troops back across the shatt alarab waterway 
that divides the warring nations 
soldiers in green iraqi uniforms made tea at a leisurely pace in 
front of former iranian bunkers 100 yards from the shatt on the 
edge of faw 
in the distance iraqi gunners periodically fired shells across 
the broad river and iranians answered with occasional shelling of 
their own 
nearly every building in the town was partly crumbled by 
shelling and giant oil storage tanks nearby were melted and 
twisted by fire 
although iran reportedly once had 50000 soldiers in the faw 
region controlling the southern 8 to 12 miles of the peninsula 
reporters on wednesday saw no iranian bodies and only moderate 
numbers of freshly destroyed weaponry 
the sides of roads leading from faw to basra were littered with 
twisted tanks and mangled trucks much of the wreckage however 
was rusted or half buried by the choking dust remnants of the 
massive 1986 battles 
iraqi officials provided no briefing on the battle or the 
casualties suffered by the two sides iraq previously has said that 
thousands of iranians were killed or wounded in the battle 
the battlefield itself was a vast and flat drained marshland 
churned and diked by defense works ranging from foxholes to massive 
earthen barriers 
as cars trucks and tanks struggled through huge clouds of 
powdery dust blown up from the field on one side of the road 
shallow marshes sprouting reeds appeared on the other 
at united nations headquarters in new york iran on wednesday 
told the un security council that iraq used cyanide nerve and 
mustard gases on a large scale during the battle in the faw 
peninsula 
in a letter to the council released wednesday irans un 
envoy mohammad jaafar mahallati said the gases affected areas 
as far as abadan an iranian city 40 miles north of faw there 
was no immediate comment from iraq 
associated press reporter salah nasrawi said hundreds of iranian 
prisoners were shown to a group of journalists that was the first 
to reach the peninsula after iran had been driven out

a researcher who gave himself an experimental 
aids vaccine still showed immune system defenses against the aids 
virus a year later thanks to booster treatments scientists 
reported today 
but the booster procedure must be simplified before it could be 
used in largescale tests to see if the vaccine can actually 
prevent aids virus infection they said 
we are in the process of finding an easier way said daniel 
zagury of the pierre and marie curie university in paris who made 
headlines in march 1987 by reporting that he and some volunteers 
had been given the vaccine 
it was the first reported human test of a vaccine against 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome there have been no side 
effects he said 
the vaccine was essentially a vaccinia virus genetically 
modified to produce an aids virus protein called gp160 the idea 
was that the immune system would react to the protein raising 
defenses that also might fight the aids virus 
in last years report zagury and coauthors said the vaccine 
made his immune system produce two kinds of defenses proteins 
called antibodies and special blood cells 
evidence of defenses appeared up to 370 days after the initial 
vaccination he and his colleagues wrote in todays british journal 
nature but there is no proof that the zagury could have resisted 
infection by the aids virus he and 16 scientists from belgium 
zaire and the national cancer institute in bethesda md wrote 
zagury received three booster treatments 
about three months after the vaccination blood cells were drawn 
from him and infected with more modified vaccinia virus then the 
cells were reinjected through a slowdrip intravenous line a 
process that took about 3 hours zagury said in a telephone 
interview 
the second and third boosters were injections of the aids virus 
protein given 299 days and 350 days after the initial vaccine two 
unvaccinated volunteers who received only the protein shots showed 
no immune system response 
zagury showed antibodies against the aids virus protein 13 days 
after the first booster a reaction lasting three months nine days 
after second treatment more antibodies against the aids virus 
protein and against a viral protein made from it called gp120 
appeared those levels rose after the third booster 
tests at various times showed that under certain conditions 
immune system factors in zagurys blood inhibited two dissimilar 
strains of the aids virus from infecting cells in the test tube 
each booster treatment also markedly increased the ability of 
zagurys immune system cells to proliferate when exposed to either 
strain in the test tube in addition his immune system cells could 
destroy virusinfected cells for a time after each booster 
treatment 
in another test doses of aids virus protein were injected just 
under the surface of zagurys skin before the second booster and 20 
days after the third his immune system reacted each time showing 
it was still primed 
the process of removing treating and reinjecting immune system 
cells would be too cumbersome to use in a largescale experiment 
as would be required to test the vaccines effectiveness zagury 
said 
bernard moss an american aids vaccine expert said the fact 
that zagurys immune system acted against quite different strains 
of the aids virus is significant 
many previous studies suggested that a vaccine using one strain 
might not work against other strains of the highly variable aids 
virus said moss chief of the laboratory of viral diseases at the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases

in a state where thousands of empty miles promise 
little more than highway hypnosis and todays culinary special may 
be a bowl of truckstop chili relief is in sight for the 
culturally bereft 
a new guidebook takes some of the mystery out of the seemingly 
endless ribbons of roadway in the lone star state by detailing 
motels restaurants gas stations convenience stores and bank 
machines at every texas freeway exit 
just gathering the information was a monumental effort said 
bill cima who probed the delights of 2400 exits during a 
fourmonth 7000mile jaunt to assemble sunset highway services 
directory exitbyexit 
his baedeker of the beaten track is a must for example at exit 
761761a in west houston where finicky tourists must decide 
whether they want to get gas at the shell mobil conoco gulf or 
exxon stations 
hungry motorists can eat at platters or steak amp ale or perhaps 
pick up something at the 24hour stop n go sunbelt national bank 
also is at the exit 
the 288page softcover book also includes arizona and new 
mexico and cima and his wife eventually want to write a 10book 
series covering the entire country but mostly except for about 50 
pages the guide concerns texas which cima said has its own 
character and personality 
shortly after drivers reach exit 0 at the texasnew mexico 
border he points out theres an antilittering sign dont mess 
with texas 
that says it all cima said its very clear when you 
enter texas youve entered the lone star state 
the cimas inaugural effort two years ago was a similar book 
about california cimas wife saundra an airline flight 
attendant came up with the idea after repeatedly driving home to 
san diego from los angeles and worrying about where to pull off the 
freeway if her car broke down 
cima a former navy test pilot cruised every texas freeway and 
many other highways with three other drivers getting off at each 
exit to make note of the services available to motorists 
that was the only way to get complete information cima said 
recently from his base in san diego 
besides restaurants motels and service stations the listings 
include shopping centers hospitals and police stations a second 
driver later retraced most of the routes to verify the information 
the southwest really seemed like a pretty good idea he 
said with all the rv recreational vehicle traffic and all the 
people coming to arizona new mexico and texas from the north it 
seemed like a logical extension of california 
as it turns out california has more exits than texas he 
said california had 2800 but obviously there are more miles of 
driving in texas the exits come a little closer in california so 
that makes the book a little more valuable commodity in texas 
about 50000 copies of the book priced at 1295 are being 
distributed to bookstores in texas 
we hope to sell a lot more than that said cima the book 
should be good for about two years things arent changing all that 
rapidly what you see is a few more businesses will pop up 
everything we have listed is going to be there in a few years

president george bush for the republican nomination for president 
saying he hadnt endorsed bush earlier because he had pledged he 
would remain neutral for the june 7 california primary 
but since all of the other republican candidates have withdrawn 
from active contention it is now appropriate to endorse bush 
deukmejian said 
deukmejian said bush is unmatched in terms of the experience 
and in terms of the leadership he has demonstrated and that the 
vice president has demonstrated his strong support and loyalty to 
president reagan and to republican ideals 
asked by reporters at a news conference if he had supported bush 
from the start or had favored one of the other gop contenders 
deukmejian briefly replied im going to keep that to myself

the michigan senate has decided to 
reinstate a presidential primary to replace the caucuses used in 
1984 and this year to distribute delegates to the democratic and 
republica national conventions 
the bill which had been the subject of several months of 
delicate bipartisan negotiations passed overwhelmingly in a 325 
vote on wednesday and was sent to the house 
the legislation which is expected to pass in the house would 
restore the closed primary for the 1992 presidential elections 
requiring voters to declare their party preference 30 days before 
the election 
a closed primary is better than no primary at all declared 
sen dick posthumus ralto the bills sponsor 
sen vernon ehlers rgrand rapids compared the bill to this 
years caucus system and said its much better to have the 
direct participation of the people 
but its going to reduce dramatically the number of people who 
will vote in that primary said sen joseph conroy dflint 
michigan launched its latest presidential primary to allocate 
delegates to the national presidential conventions among the 
various white house hopefuls in 1972 democrats quit using the 
primary after 1976 because their national rules prohibited open 
primaries and the gop dropped it after 1980 
the primary has been estimated to cost the state about 52 
million

ohios top democrats say they will remain 
neutral despite michael dukakis new york primary victory making 
him the frontrunner for the partys presidential nomination 
in fact they differed wednesday on whether the masschusetts 
governor had locked up the partys nomination based on his showing 
in new york 
sen john glenn said dukakis seemed virtually assured of the 
nomination but gov richard celeste and ohio democratic chairman 
james ruvolo cautioned however that it was too early to count out 
jesse jackson 
i would presume at this point it looks like dukakis is going 
to be the candidate glenn told reporters during an informal 
morning briefing in washington i dont think theres a whole lot 
of doubt about that the new york thing almost locks it up for 
dukakis or comes close to it 
celeste said a crucial battle looms june 7 in california where

president roh taewoo today said he 
would not tolerate more violence in the national assembly campaign 
the opposition called for more protests claiming the government 
sought to rig the elections 
police meanwhile today released about 30 governing party 
supporters who were held hostage by opposition party supporters in 
a city south of seoul after a dispute over campaign literature on 
wednesday about 30 people were injured in scattered violence 
related to the election 
roh today said his governing democratic justice party must 
retain its majority in the assembly in tuesdays elections to 
ensure national stability and the introduction of full democracy 
whoever violates the law and destroys democratic order must be 
punished severely in the name of the people he said in a 
nationally televised news conference 
opposition leaders charged the government was conspiring to rig 
the elections they warned they would call for a repeat of the 
nationwide violence that hit the nation last june if the elections 
are rigged 
the ruling party will face popular resistance and disobedience 
if its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue said 
opposition leader kim daejung of the party for peace and democracy 
rival opposition leader kim youngsam of the reunification 
democratic party said he would be forced to make a grave 
decision if the government cheated the roh regime should not 
forget the lesson from the june struggle 
all political parties have been wooing voters with money meals 
and free day trips in frenzied races for assembly seats but there 
has been no sign so far of government election rigging 
police secured the release early today of about 30 governing 
party supporters who were held hostage by the kim daejungs party 
in youngam 120 miles south of seoul 
police said they promised to investigate a clash between the two 
groups 
the opposition supporters seized the democratic justice members 
after a quarrel over distributing campaign leaflets and held them 
in a peace and democracy party office that was surrounded by 600 
riot police 
the hostages were tied up and smeared with red paint 
angry opposition supporters later marched on a police station 
after police arrested some peace and democracy party members 
involved in the incident riot police broke up the protest with 
volleys of tear gas and arrested seven people 
at least 33 people were injured wednesday in scattered clashes 
between government and opposition supporters in the cities of 
masan jungju kohung and andong 
roh appealed for orderly elections and accused the opposition of 
fomenting unrest he said his party must keep control of the 
national assembly if it is to govern effectively 
it is my desire to see the ruling party win a majority of 
seats in the national assembly in order for me to effectively run 
the government he said 
the government may have trouble retaining its majority in the 
assembly because of public reluctance to accept the roh government 
roh took office in february after winning a fiveyear 
presidential term with 336 percent of the vote in december after 
rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote 
roh an exgeneral who helped put former president chun doohwan 
in power with military backing in 1980 has attempted to cut his 
ties to the authoritarian government he replaced 
he repeated his promise today to ensure full democracy 
the opposition which was discredited by its internal divisions 
during the presidential election is struggling to stage a comeback 
it has claimed the government won the presidential election by 
fraud but failed to provide evidence 
opposition leaders have attacked the roh government with charges 
of corruption after former president chuns brother was arrested in 
march on charges of embezzling millions of dollars 
the opposition also claims roh will continue militarybacked 
rule 
but the two main opposition parties failed to reunite for the 
elections and are again fighting for opposition votes both are 
determined to emerge as the main opposition force 
roh who promised to root out corruption under the chun regime 
today said he would keep his promise to end any official abuse of 
power and ensure a clean government

two chicks of a bird species found only on 
an island off east africa have been hatched here wildlife 
authorities said 
the chicks mauritius kestrels were displayed wednesday at 
the world center for birds of prey south of boise 
one was hatched tuesday and the other on april 13 are the first 
kestrels to be hatched in captivity in the united states officials 
said 
this is a real accomplishment said bill burnham director 
of the center 
he said the birds exist only on the indian ocean island of 
mauritius 
the birds were on the verge of extinction when the boisebased 
peregrine fund began studying the species in 1973 through captive 
breeding in mauritius the population has grown to more than 70 
birds 
in mauritius destruction of the forests in the black river 
gorge resulted in reduction of the kestrels favorite food a 
treedwelling lizard it also is located in the middle of a cyclone 
belt 
kestrel experts like willard heck who is raising the newborns 
said one key to the their survival may lie in forcing them to live 
on other islands and to eat a wider variety of food 
in idaho heck is using forceps to feed the chicks quail that is 
ground up like hamburger the chicks have an excellent chance of 
survival he said 
heck hopes to release the kestrels in mauritius next fall they 
weigh less than an ounce now and will weigh about half a pound 
when fully grown 
the peregrine fund is a nonprofit organization founded in 1970 
known best for its pioneering work in preventing the extinction of 
peregrine falcons the center has expanded its focus to preserving 
raptors worldwide

passengers on the ferry got out of their seats to watch the 
orangebrown juvenile whale with a crown of barnacles as it dived 
beneath the boat 
mammal experts said it is not unusual for a young gray whale to 
cruise the bay this time of year this ones seems to be lingering 
longer than most however they said 
we see a whale in the bay probably once every year but never 
one that hangs around this much said mick beatie one of two 
captains running the larkspur ferry on wednesday morning thats 
the unusual part about it 
the whale estimated to be 5 years old could have accidentally 
come into the bay on an incoming tide or merely been curious said 
steve cooper education director of the oceanic society expeditions 
of san francisco 
thousands of gray whales an endangered species are in the 
midst of a migration from the warm shallow calving lagoons of baja 
california in mexico to the cool waters of alaska where they

the toughest battlefield in the war on 
aids will be africa but the last skirmishes may be fought in the 
back alleys where drug addicts congregate the head of the world 
health organization says 
a health problem is never just a medical problem dr 
halfdan t mahler directorgeneral of who said in an interview 
aids is just as much a political problem its a social problem 
its an economic problem 
mahler a craggyfeatured dane speaks of fighting disease with 
a missionary zeal he says he refuses to be daunted by the 
challenge of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
if you get overwhelmed then you lose your imagination he 
said during a visit to un headquarters this week 
the genevabased who estimates there are about 150000 cases of 
aids worldwide and an additional 5 million to 10 million people 
infected with the aids virus it says 129 countries have reported 
the disease 
mahler said aids is spreading fast in urban africa south of the 
sahara a region where economic problems have made even the fight 
against curable diseases difficult 
africa has been more underprivileged and more overtraumatized 
by history than any other place mahler said obviously it is a 
continent where development has gone wrong but i take aids as a 
challenge in this difficult situation 
there is no known cure or vaccine for aids a viral disease that 
destroys the bodys immune system and leaves victims susceptible to 
a wide variety of infections and cancers it is spread through 
sexual contact tainted blood sharing of contaminated hypodermic 
needles or syringes by drug abusers or passed on by infected 
mothers to their children at or before birth 
mahler praised the efforts of subsaharan nations to develop 
national programs against aids with the help of who 
we have truely been able to set in motion programs that i 
believe in spite of the absence of vaccines and drugs will bear 
fruit over the next four five six years he said 
intravenous drug abusers however may prove to be the most 
intractable problem he said partly because they tend to be 
selfdestructive and are less likely to take the kinds of 
precautions that can stem aids compounding the problem is the 
worldwide failure to curb drug use he said 
we have been doing very badly with the iv drug users mahler 
said 
mahler said his attitude toward aids has changed dramatically 
i had not realized in the first few years that it had the 
explosive potential that it has he acknowledged 
two years ago he was criticized for saying aids was getting 
undue attention in comparison to the millions of children who die 
every year of curable or preventable diseases like malaria 
measles whooping cough or simple diarrhea 
now mahler says he regards aids as the most serious health 
problem confronting the world he said that in the past year who 
has intensified its efforts against the disease trying to 
coordinate a global strategy to check aids 
we know it is exploding in many parts of africa we know it is 
exploding in many parts of central america the caribbean and latin 
american countries we know that it is also starting to explode 
among certain iv drug users in certain asian countries he said 
it makes you very nervous

the environmental protection agency says 
preliminary results from new tests show that a controversial 
chemical used to regulate the growth of apples does cause tumors in 
mice 
but epa assistant administrator john a moore in an arpil 8 
letter to the international apple institute said the agency does 
not yet have enough information to make a decision on what to do 
however moore said in the letter obtained by the associated 
press on wednesday that a decision could be announced as early as 
fall on whether to ban use of the chemical 
the chemical daminozide had been used on about 40 percent of 
the nations apple crop applied in the summer it slows growth 
makes apples ripen together deepens color and lengthens storage 
life 
the agency began studying daminozide in 1980 and proposed to ban 
it in 1985 but decided to order new studies when its own 
scientific advisers said it had not proved its case it did lower 
the permissible residues in apples and the amount that may be used 
in orchards 
i hope that it is clear from the information provided in this 
letter that we do not yet have enough information to decide what 
to do about daminozide moore wrote 
uniroyal chemical co of middlebury conn which manufactures 
daminozide has told apple growers it remains confident that the 
chemical sold under the trade name alar eventually will be 
cleared

grocery shoppers will be able to get 
rainchecks or substitutes from their supermarkets on advertised 
items under a new federal trade commission rule 
although those are common practices of many businesses they 
have technically been illegal for supermarkets a under rule adopted 
in 1971 
super markets were expected to have enough stock on hand of 
advertised items to meet reasonably anticipated demand and 
could have been fined before the ftc rule change 
the commission voted 32 wednesday to amend that rule to permit 
grocers to offer rainchecks or to substitute items if they run out 
in addition if grocers want to advertise something they know is 
in limited supply they would be allowed to clearly state in the 
ads that supplies are limited

smoldering in latin america and it may be beginning to smolder in 
asia 
bradshaw langmaid chairman of the agencys working group on

of the house appropriations committee langmaid said in general 
asian governments view aids as a less urgent problem and have moved 
more slowly to undertake aids prevention and control efforts

hundreds of police today surrounded a 
bank in northwestern mexico where six gunmen held more than 40 
customers and employees captive after four hostages were killed and 
about 10 wounded 
the gunmen who were caught robbing the bank wednesday 
threatened to kill their hostages unless they allowed to travel to 
a nearby airport and leave on a plane said ignacio lara spokesman 
for the sinaloa state governor 
authorities gave conflicting accounts about how the casualties 
occurred one official said they occurred in a shootout with 
police another said the gunmen shot the hostages inside the bank 
the standoff in this coastal gulf of california city of 120000 
began at 1245 pm wednesday 345 pm edt after the gunmen 
burst into the banamex bank and an alarm alerted police to the 
robbery said ramiro guerrero news editor at the noroeste 
newspaper in the state capital of culiacan 
one of two police officers inside conducting business roberto 
soto cruz tried to prevent the robbery and was shot lara said 
the other officer apparently was disarmed by the robbers the 
spokesman said 
the gunmen then attempted to leave the surrounded bank using 
soto and at least one customer as a shield said guerrero who was 
on the scene 
the customer marco antonio estrada was killed and soto 
received more wounds when the escape attempt led to a gun battle 
between police and the robbers in which nine or 10 hostages 
were wounded according to lara 
it was not clear if the wounded were still among the hostages 
he said 
soto died at a hospital after the gunmen allowed red cross 
officials to escort him from the building guerrero said 
the other two people killed were identified as manuel andoval 
rendon a bank official who died of a gunshot wound to the chest 
and cashier rosi maria padilla 22 who was reported shot in the 
face 
lara said the two were killed during the escape attempt 
however guerrero said they were shot earlier by the gunmen lara 
said authorities believed there were 59 hostages inside the bank 
hector paliza another spokesman for the sinaloa state 
government gave a different account of the incident 
he said the gunmen became angry after the bank alarm was 
sounded shot and killed three people inside the bank fatally 
wounded soto who died later in a hospital and shot and wounded 
about 10 of the hostages 
the gunmen then tried to escape through a bank window but were 
repelled by police gunfire paliza said he added the gunmen 
released the wounded and were still holding about 40 people inside 
the bank building 
lara said police were negotiating with the gunmen by telephone 
but refusing to give in to their demands for safe passage to the 
airport 
alfredo lopez assistant commander of the federal judicial 
police in sinaloa state said authorities would permit the gunmen 
to leave the building only with their hands raised and if they 
respect the lives of the hostages 
the six made telephone calls to state gov francisco labastida 
ochoa and the mexican tv network televisa demanding to be allowed 
to leave the site 
more than 1000 municipal and judicial police backed by fire 
apparatus had cordoned off several blocks surrounding the bank 
building guerrero said los mochis is about 500 miles south of 
tuscon ariz

for 11 kuwaiti oil tankers reregistered under the stars and 
stripes for protection from iranian attack 
the 200plus crew members of the jack williams were still 
putting things back in order cleaning equipment weapons and 
passageways in the wake of mondays action 
in the course of it iran fired five missiles at the jack 
williams and two destroyers sailing with it navy officers said 
they were chinesemade silkworm missiles fired from antiship 
batteries along the strait of hormuz for the first time the 
pentagon said it had not determined what type of missile was fired 
all five missiles went awry their guidance systems confused by 
aluminum chaff fired into the air by the us ships 
the 3700ton frigate operating in the southern gulf remained 
at condition 1alpha the secondhighest level of alert in the 
navy below general quarters 
the williams skipper cmdr edward mann 42 of bucks county 
pa said we can do this for a month if necessary because we 
have trained organized and planned to do it we came here ready 
for the long haul 
an alarm sounded at midmorning wednesday when the ships radar 
picked up a signal that the combat information center evaluated as 
a sea hunter radar system one that iran is known to possess and 
that can be used to locate a missile target 
lt cmdr mark van dyke a spokesman for the navys joint task 
force middle east said the radar twitch would be analyzed to 
determine where it originated 
the missile destroyer joseph strauss and the destroyer obrien 
are also part of desron 22 the destroyer squadron command aboard 
this warship obriens home port is san diego strauss is based at 
pearl harbor 
also wednesday the jack williams warned off an iranian c130 
aircraft whose pilot at first ignored the ships radioed 
challenges and then answered by saying we are an iranian 
warplane doing our duty 
a voice speaking accented english then said martyr do your 
duty 
minutes after the c130 landed at irans nearby abu musa island 
the frigate went to general quarters as a precaution against the 
possibility that a canister of cs a nonlethal type of riot 
control gas had been dropped in the area a team checked the ship 
and found no indications any such canister had been dropped 
the ship also received brief reports of iranian speedboats 
attacking commercial vessels in the strait of hormuz and the 
discovery of two floating mines apparently by the french navy 
farther north 
british and italian minesweepers also were understood to be 
taking part in minehunting operations in international waters of 
the central gulf 
capt donald dyer commander of desron 22 said the mines 
apparently were floating rather than moored and were found 70 
miles southwest of where the us guidedmissile frigate samuel b 
roberts was severely damaged last week 
the united states accused iran of laying the mine that damaged 
the roberts and retaliated by shelling two iranian oil platforms 
after that iranian attack boats went on a rampage and us naval 
forces and neutral shipping us forces sank or damaged six 
iranian warships 
the jack williams crew on wednesday hashed over the events the 
first combat experience for all expect the captain cmdr edward 
mann and master chief petty officer joseph johnson 
the crewmen whose average age is about 22 appeared generally 
united in believing that the us action against iran was proper 
nobody wants to kill people but you cant just let them run 
over everybody said petty officer 2nd class larry doyle 20 of 
zanesville ohio 
doyle the ships storekeeper was a communications man on the 
bridge throughout those hectic hours when missiles left the sky 
crisscrossed with trails and deck officers shouted silkworm 
inbound as the lumbering projectiles were spotted visually or by 
electronic means 
also on the bridge was seaman edwin rivera 25 who lives with 
his wife in mayport fla home port of the jack williams 
rivera who keeps a diary of everything that has happened on his 
frigates gulf excursion said the situation was scary but the 
worst was when our own missile was fired and we didnt know it was 
going to happen it took everybody by surprise he said 
gunners mate david talbert 18 said he was manning the 
williams 76mm deck gun during the excitement and found it the 
same as always when were at general quarters 
but theres a helpless feeling in there not knowing whats 
going on is worse than something happening said talbert whose 
class at northwestern high school in springfield ohio will 
graduate in june 
some sailors asked members of a pentagon news media pool aboard 
the frigate to let their relatives in the united states know that 
they were all right 
thats the most important thing to let them know that said 
doyle

the death of an american engineer killed in 
nicaragua was unfortunate but justifiable a contra spokeswoman 
said after the mans family filed a 50 million wrongful death 
lawsuit against the rebels 
benjamin linder 27 was fatally shot april 28 1987 when 
contra troops attacked the small hydroelectric project that the 
portland ore man was helping to build in northern nicaragua 
he was killed during an ambush that took place in a highly 
active war zone said marta sacasa a spokeswoman for the 
nicaraguan resistance based here 
named as defendants in the federal suit filed earlier wednesday 
are the nicaraguan resistance adolfo calero and aristides sanchez 
directors of the umbrella organization and military leaders 
enrique bermudez and indalecio rodriguez 
they wounded ben and then shot him through the head at 
pointblank range said linders mother elisabeth linder this 
is an act of murder and those responsible should pay for their 
crimes 
but ms sacasa said the nicaraguan government is responsible for 
linders death because it allowed him to go into an area that was 
obviously dangerous she also said that linder armed and dressed 
in a uniform was with sandinistas when he was fatally shot 
these factors make the attack during which he was killed 
legitimate said ms sacasa who added that benjamin linders 
death is being used by his family for political propaganda 
linders father dr david linder said his sons death was no 
accident he and his coworkers were targeted by the contras 
because they were bringing electricity to poor nicaraguans 
the suit was referred to us district judge stanley marcus but 
no hearing has been set

the house of commons barred a militant scottish 
member from the next 20 working days of commons business for 
damaging the 16thcentury staff that symbolizes the speakers 
authority 
legislators voted 46326 wednesday night to suspend ron brown a 
leftwing member of the socialist opposition labor party 
brown grabbed the ornate 5footlong mace in the commons on 
monday night and dropped it in front of the sergeantatarms in an 
angry protest over government cuts in welfare payments 
the suspension vote followed browns refusal tuesday to read out 
a formal statement of apology for his behavior 
earlier wednesday the labor party hierarchy voted to ostracize 
brown from any role in party activities for three months it is the 
first time in 21 years that labor leaders have taken such action 
the decision must be approved by a ballot of labors 229 elected 
representatives their decision takes effect only when brown 
returns from any suspension agreed by the commons 
the whole thing is a storm in a tea cup the 47yearold 
brown told reporters before the vote i have a job of work to do 
and i will still do it even if i am suspended 
at the end of debate monday night brown marched from his seat 
in the back benches on to the floor of the commons threw papers in 
the face of a junior government minister then picked up the 
16pound mace from its resting place at the foot of the table 
behind which commons officers sit 
what happened next is disputed 
the times of london and other news media witnesses said brown 
threw the mace on the floor causing an estimated 1890 worth of 
damage to the silvergilt staff before storming out of the 
chamber brown says he accidentally dropped the mace 
the mace is officially part of the crown jewels its presence in 
the commons indicates the legislative body is in session 
news reports said labor party leader neil kinnock is exasperated 
that the antics of rebel laborites are distracting attention from 
labors attacks on government moves to reform the postworld war ii 
welfare benefits system 
brown and other militants have vowed to use guerrilla 
tactics to disrupt the commons in which prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservatives have a comfortable majority of 102 
unruly legislators now routinely hurl insults at each other and 
shout down opponents ignoring appeals for order from speaker 
bernard weatherill 
last month weatherill banned a scottish national party 
legislator for five days for screaming abuse that caused an 
unprecedented suspension of budget day proceedings 
the uproar was prompted by the governments announcement that it 
was slashing income tax for top wage earners from 60 to 40 percent

immigrant schoolchildren are hampered by rigid 
placement practices lack of bilingual education cultural 
insensitivity harassment from other students and fear of 
deportation a new study says 
such children often are placed in classes for the handicapped or 
at inappropriate grade levels because schools cant cope with their 
cultural differences according to the study released wednesday 
this is true even though the education level of many new 
immigrants is superior to that of previous migrations and 
sometimes exceeds that of americans added the 129page study 
titled new voices immigrant students in the us public 
schools 
the study was conducted by the bostonbased national coalition 
of advocates for students and funded largely by the ford foundation 
the supreme court has ruled that all schoolage immigrants are 
entitled to an education regardless of whether they are here 
legally the study noted 
about 66 million people immigrated to the united states in the 
1970s more than twothirds of them legally forming one of the 
largest migrations in us history and one that is continuing the 
study said 
newcomers arriving now are primarily from asia mexico central 
and south america and the caribbean it said immigrant children 
who number up to 27 million comprise about 6 percent of total 
us public school enrollment 
after conducting public hearings in six gateway cities for 
immigrants and after interviewing parents and educators across the 
country researchers reported that schools are doing a poor job of 
meeting immigrant students needs 
some areas of the country are fostering an english only or 
english first movement undercutting public funding for 
educational programs serving students who speak little or no 
english the study said 
the movement sends a clear message to newcomers that their 
languages and cultures are unwelcome and inferior a point of view 
which ill prepares this country for the realities of its domestic 
and international future it said 
dropout rates for immigrant students are high suicide attempts 
are all too frequent and some young newcomers under extreme 
pressure have responded by forming gangs for emotional and physical 
protection the study found 
though the study could provide no figures on how often immigrant 
children are misclassified into special education programs with 
physically and mentally handicapped youngsters it apparently has 
happened frequently the authors said 
as far back as 1916 special classes frequently served as an 
easy means of disposing of a nonenglish speaking pupil who 
through no fault of his own is an unsatisfactory member of a 
regular class the study said 
reine leroy an intergrou relations representative from dade 
county fla told the researchers teachers thought that these 
kids were dumb that they could not learn 
the study suggested restructuring public schools to better 
assess immigrant students for placement in appropriate grades 
boosting the quality of bilingual education and providing 
counseling and support geared specifically to immigrants

israelis celebrated their countrys 40th 
anniversary under tight security today and arabs threw a homemade 
explosive at soldiers in bethlehem during ploordered firebomb 
day in the occupied lands 
for a second day the army barred the 15 million palestinians 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip from entering israel to 
prevent disturbances it also barred journalists from most of the 
territories where curfews were maintained over 23 refugee camps 
and towns for a fifth day all told more than 400000 arabs were 
living under curfew 
in a special independence day interview prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said nearly five months of antioccupation violence appeared 
to be winding down and called on arab activists to stop the rioting 
shamir told israel radio that palestinian leaders heads were 
in the clouds their demands have reached the skies 
according to un figures 169 arabs have died since the 
uprising began 19 weeks ago in the territories israel seized in the 
1967 middle east war two israelis also have been killed 
despite the unrest israelis marked the holiday with picnics 
hikes through the countryside and visits to army bases specially 
opened to the public 
in jerusalem president chaim herzog held a reception for 
veterans of the 1948 war in which israel won its independence 
the 24hour independence day festivities were launched on 
wednesday night with a torchlighting ceremony at jerusalems mount 
herzl 
hundreds of thousands of israelis then took to the streets to 
sing dance and watch fireworks in keeping with tradition youths 
knocked passersby over the head with plastic hammers and sprayed 
them with a dry foam 
one of the highlights was a military show at ramat gan stadium 
near tel aviv featuring parachute jumps fighter jets tanks and 
fireworks it was the first display of armaments since 1973 israel 
has tended to refrain from such exhibits to avoid emphasizing the 
role of wars in its history 
hundreds of soldiers patrolled the west bank today including 16 
soldiers outside the dheishe refugee camp on bethlehems outskirts 
israelis were warned to be on the alert for suspicious objects 
during the holiday 
most palestinians stayed off the job observing a general strike 
call from the palestine liberation organization and underground 
leaders 
they had also been asked to throw firebombs at israeli soldiers 
and in bethlehem palestinians hurled a gasoline bomb at an israeli 
patrol 
troops responded with rubber bullets breaking all the windows 
in one home according to an ap reporter at the scene the soldiers 
also fired live rounds into the air and lobbed tear gas canisters 
on wednesday underground leaders issued leaflet no 14 which 
called on palestinians to mark last weeks assassination of plo 
military commander khalil wazir with strikes and demonstrations 
tunisian authorities and israeli sources say he was killed by 
israeli commandos the israeli government refused comment 
the killing caused violent protests on saturday during which 
israeli soldiers shot and killed 17 palestinians the highest death 
toll for a single day since the uprising began 
another palestinian was shot to death wednesday and 10 wounded 
in protests that defied curfews in effect since saturday 
leaflet no 14 bore a picture of wazir and contained a pledge to 
him to follow your path until the flag to which you dedicated 
your life will be raised over jerusalem the capital of our 
independent palestinian state 
it also called for a general strike on april 28 to protest the 
deportation of palestinian activists since dec 8 israel has 
expelled 20 alleged palestinian agitators to lebanon 
on wednesday the army established a new prison for arab 
detainees north of jerusalem to help incarcerate the 5000 
palestinians arrested since the uprising began 
if was the fifth new israeli prison established since the 
uprising began according to the palestinian human rights group law

an apparently flawless testfiring of 
the space shuttles redesigned booster rocket has improved the odds 
of nasa meeting its goal of resuming manned space flight in 
midaugust officials say 
wednesdays twominute firing of the 126foot rocket went 
smoothly but spokesmen for nasa and morton thiokol which 
manufactures the booster say it will take a week to 10 days to 
verify the test was a success 
a cursory inspection of the rocket afterward indicated the 
redesigned seals in the boosters joints prevented an escape of hot 
gases despite deliberately builtin flaws 
its a happy day for a lot of people said royce mitchell 
solid rocket program manager for the national aeronautics and space 
administration so far it looks excellent 
in a posttest briefing alan mcdonald morton thiokol vice 
president for engineering displayed a graph on which nearly 
identical curves compared engineers predictions with a preliminary 
test evaluation taken from electronic monitors 
unless youre about only eight millimeters away you cant 
tell any difference mcdonald said 
barring discovery of problems as the rocket is dismantled 
wednesdays success means morton thiokol must conduct only two more 
fullscale tests in june and july before nasa can proceed with an 
august launch of the shuttle discovery 
it would be americas first manned space flight since the 
shuttle challenger exploded 70 seconds after liftoff on jan 28 
1986 killing seven crew members 
its like finally winning the quarterfinals of the ncaa 
mcdonald said of the test 
the critical concern is whether superhot gases escaped the 
flawed seals a presidential commission blamed the challenger 
disaster on a joint between segments of the booster rocket whose 
seals failed allowing gases to escape and ignite the space crafts 
exterior fuel tank 
since then engineers have added a third oring to the seals and 
a metal lip or capture feature to contain gases that may leak 
around the joints linking the four segments of the rocket 
the casetonozzle joint also has been strengthened with 100 
radial bolts to prevent vibration during launch part of a redesign 
planned before the challenger exploded this joint attaches the 
nozzle to the aft segment 
in the middle joint engineers left a gap onetenth of an inch 
wide between two sections of insulation to see if it would seal 
itself under pressure from the expanding gases as it has in 
shortduration tests 
a second flaw was placed in the adhesive binding insulation 
inside the casetonozzle joint a tiny blowhole was created to 
allow gases to reach the wiper oring which was installed as 
part of the new design to keep the adhesive in place however it 
also acts as an additional seal to protect the primary and 
secondary orings in the shortduration tests gases have hit the 
wiper ring but have not gone past it 
mcdonald said the flaws were more severe than anything likely to 
occur during manufacture or assembly 
it is indeed a failsafe if at any time gas gets beyond the 
point we expect it to the joint still is going to perform he 
said

mexican journalists say the shotgun 
slaying of a satirical columnist is part of a pattern of 
intimidation and a colleague said he might ask mexicos federal 
government to take over the investigation 
hector felix miranda the 47yearold coeditor of zeta was 
killed while driving to work wednesday morning said district 
attorney francisco dominguez 
police said they had not determined a motive 
according to a spokesman for the state prosecutors office in 
tijuana a brown pickup truck with a camper shell pulled alongside 
felixs car shots were fired from an automatic 12gauge shotgun 
this cowardly act increases the climate of insecurity in which 
tijuana journalists live said enrique garca sanchez city editor 
of tijuanas oldest daily el heraldo he said he would go to 
mexican president miguel de la madrid if state investigators do not 
solve the case 
five mexican journalists have been killed this year and 35 have 
been killed in the past decade 
last year zetas offices were sprayed with bullets from a 
passing car no one was injured and police never found those 
responsible 
herman baca president of the san diegobased committee on 
chicano rights said wednesday a letter asking for an investigation 
into the slaying was being sent to de la madrid 
this assassination poses the greatest threat to freedom of the 
press in mexico baca said theres been a large number of 
other journalists who have met a similar fate and its obvious 
that it has become a pattern to silence the independent press in 
mexico 
jesus blancornelas who cofounded the weekly zeta with felix in 
1980 speculated that the killing was an act of political revenge 
the government said that it respects freedom of expression and 
that the police are among the most advanced blancornelas said 
we hope that both those things might be demonstrated 
felix known as felix the cat wrote for the weekly zeta 
which has a circulation of 60000 throughout baja california his 
column a little bit of something often accused government 
officials and business people of arrogant behavior 
he was a satirist he was very wellknown and popular here in 
the state said miguel cervantes a writer for zeta cervantes 
said felix had no known enemies and called the shooting an act of 
cowards aimed at muzzling the press 
felixs murder follows by two months the stillunsolved slaying 
of manuel burgueno orduno editor of the monthly political magazine 
deslinde in the baja california coastal resort city of mazatlan

the earth has apparently been spared the worst 
effects of the el nino weather phenomenon with the most recent of 
these events coming to a close after a fairly docile stay 
droughts in india and the pacific northwest were reported as 
well as unusually heavy rains in portions of south america which 
scientists have associated with the el nino which began in 1986 
by contrast the 198283 el nino disrupted weather around much 
of the world eventually being blamed for 1500 deaths and damage 
totaling between 2 billion and 8 billion 
vernon e kousky of the federal climate analysis center in camp 
springs md confirmed wednesday that pacific ocean surface 
temperatures a prime gauge of el nino events have returned to 
near normal 
an el nino is considered underway when water temperatures rise 
onehalf degree to one degree celsius above normal in the western 
pacific kousky said currently these temperatures have dropped 
back to normal or even a bit below he said 
since climate conditions change only gradually another el nino 
is unlikely for at least two years indeed it may be as long as 
four or five years kousky said in a telephone interview 
in the meantime he has halted the monthly diagnostic 
advisories issued by his office on the event known by scientists 
as the enso for el ninosouthern oscillation 
lowlevel winds sea surface temperatures sea level 
pressure and central pacific atmospheric convection indicate a 
return to nonenso conditions kousky reported in his final 
advisory 
the name el nino pronounced el neenyo was applied by 
south american fishermen who notice the event because it reduces 
the fish catch when water temperatures change the change usually 
is first noticable around christmastime so the fishermen applied 
the spanish name for child referring to the christ child 
southern oscillation is a term used by scientists referring to 
changes in air pressure over the tropical pacific ocean 
only in recent years have researchers determined that the two 
events are interconnected thus the combined name now in use 
in a normal el nino year there is a weakening of the indian 
monsoon which occurred last summer along with reductions in 
rainfall in such areas as indonesia the philippines and several 
pacific islands 
in addition the el nino weather patterns last year blocked the 
normal movement of storms in the northern pacific ocean pushing 
them northward into alaska and northern british columbia and 
apparently leading to a drought in the pacific northwest warm 
weather in the western states and wetness in the southeast are 
common when el nino occurs 
thus the wet winter in the southeast in 198687 may also have 
been related to the event 
these changes are what one would expect in an el nino kousky 
has said by comparison the 198283 one was unusual in that the 
weather changes were disasterous worldwide kousky noted 
that event was extraordinarily severe while the one just ending 
was more like other recent el nino events such as those of 1957 
1963 1965 1969 197273 1975 and 1976 
while scientists are still trying to determine what causes these

former moscow communist party chief 
boris n yeltsin fired for criticizing the slow progress of 
reforms in the soviet union says he was correct in speaking out a 
sovietpublished newspaper said 
in an interview in the may issue of the germanlanguage moskow 
news yeltsin was quoted as saying i belong to the ones who are 
willing to take the rough road and have no fear of risks 
yeltsin was fired in november after a critical speech in october 
before the central committee of the soviet communist party 
the report describes visits by a moscow correspondent to 
yeltsins office where he now works as the soviet unions deputy 
chief of the state constructions committee and to a hospital where 
he was admitted temporarily for heart problems 
moscow news is based in cologne and lists as its publisher the 
soviet unions novosti news agency it also lists the giant gruner 
and jahr publishing house of hamburg as one of the west german 
companies cooperating in the publication 
the may issue is the newspapers first 
yeltsin was quoted as saying he was surprised to hear that there 
were printed copies of his october speech 
that must be a forgery yeltsin was quoted as saying 
there was absolutely no printed text of my speech at the 
october plenum 
but the interview published with a photograph of yeltsin 
walking with his grandson boris jr in what appears to be a park 
indicates he does not feel he was wrong in criticizing the soviet 
system 
i spoke straightforwardly and said what i felt and thought was 
correct the report quotes him as saying 
yeltsin is quoted as explaining his reason for criticizing the 
slowmoving reforms without citing any names 
someone had correctly said each must think independently so 
that later not all suddenly see the light all at once 
the report says yeltsin declined to repeat what he had said at 
the central committee meeting in october because the committee had 
not formally decided to make the plenum remarks public 
i as a central committee member am not permitted to violate 
this rule the newspaper quoted yeltsin as saying 
lev n zaikov replaced yeltsin as party chief of moscow on nov 
11 in what some political observers said was a move by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev to appease opponents of his reform 
program for more openess in soviet society

the federal government is moving to legalize a 
common supermarket practice giving out rainchecks or substitutes 
when a store runs out of advertised items 
while an effective date has not been announced the federal 
trade commission voted 32 wednesday to permit substitutes and 
rainchecks at grocery stores 
many stores of all types have been making such offers for years 
of course but technically the practice was made illegal for 
grocery stores in 1971 
in that year the commission adopted a regulation requiring that 
grocers have enough stock on hand to meet reasonably anticipated 
demand for advertised items those that run out can be fined 
though that has rarely happened in practice 
under the change approved wednesday grocers that dont want to 
offer substitutes or rainchecks would be allowed to advertise items 
in limited supply if they clearly state in the ads that supplies 
are limited 
the 1971 rule was adopted following studies that showed as much 
as 10 percent of advertised items were unavailable in markets in 
the 1970s 
by 1984 however that rate had dropped to between 3 percent and 
5 percent and the commission began to reconsider the rule 
the commission staff at that time reported that the costs to 
supermarkets of observing the rule keeping added stock on hand 
and perhaps limiting advertising raised the cost of groceries 
more than the sale prices lowered them 
in other words the staff said the rule was forcing consumers 
to pay an extra 14 cents to 33 cents a week in their grocery bill 
on that basis some commission staffers recommended abandoning 
the rule altogether an approach that drew heavy negative public 
comment in 1984 
nonetheless commissioner terry calvani pressed again wednesday 
to have the entire rule repealed 
i dont believe there is a problem he said contending that 
supermarket managers strive to please their customers rather than 
injure them 
in such a competitive business if a market regularly failed to 
stock advertised items customers would just stop shopping there 
he said 
commissioner andrew j strenio though contended that the rule 
simply requires retail food markets to honor the promises they 
make in advertising 
strenio added that he is skeptical of the statistics that show 
the cost of the rule to be more than the savings to consumers and 
said he opposed any changes in the rule that has been in effect 
since 1971 
thus calvani and strenio voted against the amendment to permit 
substitutions and rainchecks but for opposite reasons 
voting for the new rule were commissioners mary azcuenaga and 
patricia l bailey and chairman daniel oliver 
oliver said he would prefer to join calvani in eliminating the 
rule altogether but since that option had been defeated on an 
earlier ballot he would support the amendment permitting use of 
rain checks or substitutes in order to give grocers as much 
flexibility as possible

secretary of state george p shultz sought a new 
arms control agreement and prepared for the next superpower summit 
in talks today with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
us officials acknowledged that verification and spacebased 
defense development dampened prospects the treaty would be ready to 
sign at the may 29june 2 summit in moscow between president reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
shevardnadze meeting shultz at a foreign ministry mansion said 
as he frequently does before talks with the secretary of state 
we are by nature optimists 
upon arrival from helsinki finland shultz was greeted by 
deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov at sheremetyevo airport 
then traveled directly to the mansion shultz did not speak to 
reporters upon arrival 
in a briefing wednesday georgy kornienko a top official of the 
communist party central committee blamed the united states for the 
slow movement toward a treaty to reduce longrange weapons by 30 to 
50 percent 
senior american officials briefing reporters wednesday in 
helsinki while shultz prepared for the talks said the soviets had 
taken a hard line on space defenses and that progress on monitoring 
three elusive weapons was also slow 
the officials said the soviets want cuts in strategic weapons 
which have a range of more than 3400 miles contingent on 
adherence to the antiballistic missile treaty the soviets contend 
the 1972 treaty prohibits the us strategic defense initiative 
the socalled star wars project to build a spacebased nuclear 
defense 
the united states has rejected that demand 
the other key problem is finding ways to monitor stockpiles of 
mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried on warships and fighter 
planes tracking sealaunched cruise missiles is probably the 
toughest point 
in addition to arms control shultzs agenda included talks on 
the iraniraq war which threatens shipping in the persian gulf 
shultz wants the soviets to back the united states in the united 
nations security council to impose an arms embargo on iran 
with soviet support the council in july last year demanded a 
ceasefire in the 7yearold war but moscow has since stymied 
us efforts to impose sanctions to pressure iran 
a us official who briefed reporters under rules of anonymity 
said shevardnadze discussed the issue on tuesday with jack matlock 
the us ambassador in moscow and called shevardnadzes attitude 
barely negative 
on arms control shultz told a helsinki news conference it would 
be hard to accomplish in time for a summit signing by reagan and 
gorbachev 
us and soviet drafts of the accord have 1200 distinct points 
of disagreement and the summit meeting is only five weeks away 
about half of the points are technical but the others touch on the 
difficult problem of verifying weapons reductions 
on dec 8 reagan and gorbachev signed a treaty scrapping their 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles which have ranges between 300 
and 3400 miles

soldiers patrolled heathrow airport today in 
armored cars and tanks in a highprofile antiterrorist measure 
one day after the hijackers of a kuwaiti jetliner freed 31 hostages 
in algeria 
the airports operators said the patrols carried out regularly 
were intended to familiarize soldiers with security at heathrow and 
were not a response to a specific terrorist alert 
the soldiers wearing battle dress and carrying weapons set up 
checkpoints with police along the airports perimeter road and at 
entrances to the terminal buildings the british airports authority 
said 
the british army has held exercises at heathrow the worlds 
busiest airport in terms of international traffic since the twin 
terrorist attacks at rome and vienna airports on dec 27 1985 in 
which 20 people were killed 
police armed with submachine guns also began patrolling heathrow 
within days of the assaults by palestinian terrorists it was 
believed to be the first time police in mainland britain had been 
seen displaying automatic weapons such official shows of force had 
previously been known only in strifetorn northern ireland

former presidential spokesman larry speakes 
said today he made up quotes from president reagan out of loyalty 
to the president and the adverse reaction to it has been a total 
surprise 
speakes said he disagrees with reagan that his book speaking 
out which covers his six years at the white house and reveals 
the quotemanufacturing constitutes kiss and tell 
speakes appearing on nbctvs today show also said he does 
not fault the president for forgetting he told him about the phony 
quotes while reagan was in geneva with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev speakes said in the book that a comment he provided as 
having been made by reagan to gorbachev was never said and another 
quote he gave as reagans actually was said by secretary of state 
george shultz 
i did it on the spur of the moment i did it in order to serve 
the president i did it as an act of loyalty to the president 
certainly not as an act of disloyalty to the president speakes 
said 
the furor over speakes confession led to his resignation last 
week as chief spokesman for merrill lynch amp co in new york a job 
he took after leaving the white house 
reacting to reagans criticism of books written by a string of 
former administration officials speakes said he doesnt think any 
of the books including his falls into the category of kiss and 
tell 
such a book would have a little more juicytype items in it 
that are a little bit more punchy said speakes 
as a former journalist speakes was asked if he did not know 
that making up quotes would be controversial 
no it was a total surprise he said a lot of people have 
told me thats done all the time in washington that you supply a 
few quotes 
speakes who told a washington post forum on tuesday that he had 
been overzealous and misguided in concocting the quotes 
said today he did not know whether the sin was in the doing or in 
the telling about it 
its hard for me to decide what im being critized for he 
said 
speakes defended his book as an honest account that he hoped 
would contribute something to the longterm value of insights 
into the reagan administration he said reagans presidency was a 
watershed because he has changed the way we think about 
government 
speakes said he was pleased with indications that the book is 
selling well and said he planned to continue giving public speeches 
and promoting the book ill just let the dust settle a little 
bit and look at opportunities in the future he said

stiff requirements tacked onto a 
probation sentence for a man whose lion mauled a young girl should 
warn the public that wild animals must be kept away from humans a 
judge says 
state district judge ted poe on wednesday ordered gary 
durkovitz 35 of houston to serve a 30day jail sentence to get 
rid of all his exotic animals and to stay away from children 
the judge also ordered durkovitz to do 20 hours community 
service work each month with the society for the prevention of 
cruelty to animals and said he would have to approve any of 
durkovitzs future jobs 
that was in additition to the 10 years probation and 5000 fine 
set by a jury wednesday last week the same jury found durkovitz 
guilty of injury to a child 
a lion owned by durkovitz attacked 8yearold roxanne hernandez 
at the texas flea market in houston last oct 10 biting off part 
of her skull and exposing the childs brain 
she has undergone reconstructive surgery and will have to have 
more operations the girls mother sonia hernandez testified that 
the girl has to wear a wig or cap in public and has trouble 
concentrating 
since the attack durkovitz has been jailed on two charges of 
indecency with a child and one of aggravated sexual assault of a 
child the cases which are pending stem from his allegedly using 
the lion and other exotic animals to attract boys prosecutors said 
defense attorney robert scardino said he was not surprised by 
the probation restrictions but said he would appeal the guilty 
verdict 
i dont think it was a crime i didnt at the time i dont 
now and i never will and i never will let this case go scardino 
said i think weve got a good chance to reverse it and try it 
again 
he could get 10 years in the penitentiary if he is retried 
but we are willing to take that risk scardino said 
harris county assistant district attorney alice brown had asked 
the jury for the maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a 
5000 fine but said she was not disappointed in the punishment 
its just incredible to me that only one child got hurt and i 
hope that if it turns any lesson its that youre not supposed to 
have these types of wild animals in the city she said 
durkovitz who testified that he had taken every safety measure 
to prevent an attack still faces a civil lawsuit in the case

for rep norman mineta who spent part of his 
childhood in a world war ii internment camp the senate vote for 
reparations to japaneseamericans was unprecedented in the annals 
of the history of any nation 
for sen spark matsunaga who spent those same war years 
fighting with the army in europe it was longdenied justice 
that removed the one great blot on the constitution 
the two japaneseamericans were on the senate floor late 
wednesday as it voted 6927 to approve a 13 billion bill that 
would direct the us government to give 20000 taxfree payments 
to japaneseamericans who were rounded up and placed in camps after 
the japanese attack dec 7 1941 on pearl harbor 
they also would get an apology 
the senate voted down 6730 and 6135 amendments that would 
have deleted the payments and left only the apology an amendment 
by sen jesse helms rnc to withhold payments until japan 
compensates american families for losses suffered at pearl harbor 
also was rejected 914 
matsunaga dhawaii estimated that about half the 120000 
internees survive today although theyre dying daily weekly of 
old age 
the elderly would get the money first under the bills fiveyear 
payout plan but whether they get the money at all will depend on 
further legislative action and a possible presidential veto 
its a very proud day said mineta who was a 10yearold 
boy from san jose calif when war arrived i just wanted to be 
on the senate floor when it happened 
the senate without a doubt gave this country a great day 
said mineta dcalif im only sorry that there werent more 
niseis japaneseamericans living today to be able to see a great 
nation apologize for its actions it is i think unprecedented in 
the annals of the history of any nation 
matsunaga the bills chief sponsor was given the presiding 
officers chair so he could personally announce the vote he had 
fought for years to win 
at the end of the long emotionfilled debate he recalled his 
combat duty with an allnisei regiment and the fellow 
japaneseamerican soldier whose death he witnessed 
i had him cradled in my arms matsunaga said he said 
lieutenant i know im going to die but i dont mind because i 
know my people back home will be treated as us citizens 
of the 120000 people of japanese ancestry who were held in the 
camps 77000 were us citizens the rest legal and illegal 
aliens many like mineta had been born in the united states 
sen daniel inouye hawaiis other japaneseamerican senator 
said these payments acknowledge the unconstitutional deprivation 
of liberty and the stigma of being deemed unloyal 
inouye like matsunaga fought in europe where combat cost him 
his right arm and earned him the distinguished service cross the 
nations second highest military honor 
the debate triggered other memories in senators who remembered 
the war 
some said an apology was in order but cash payments were not 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo argued that the internment was 
not a dishonorable act it was the option of a nation in the first 
days of a war 
even if it was dishonorable wallop argued it would be 
repugnant to think a clear conscience is to be had for a mere 
20000 figure honor doesnt come with a dollar sign on it and 
you dont buy it back 
sen chic hecht rnev said i cannot in good conscience go 
back and tell survivors of bataan iwo jima and all those battles 
in the south pacific and tell them we have forgotten you but we are 
compensating the people who we moved into camps 
money to pay the surviving internees will be contained in 
appropriations bills spread over the next five years with 500 
million to be considered as part of the 1989 budget now before 
congress 
while largely similar to the version passed by the house on a 
243141 vote last september the senate version also provides a 
multimilliondollar package for aleut indians moved from the 
aleutian islands off alaska during a japanese attack in 1942 
matsunaga asked about veto prospects said we have mixed 
reports from the white house the administration has voiced 
support for the measure said presidential spokesman bj cooper 
but it has also sought changes in the legislation including the 
deletion of money for payments to the aleuts 
citing its 13 billion cost the white house office of 
management and budget has recommended that reagan veto the measure 
but matsunaga said that howard baker the former senator from 
tennessee and now reagans chief of staff had told him that if 
were still a member of the senate he would have cosponsored the 
legislation 
mineta conceded that a veto would be very difficult to 
override 
about 900 aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live 
in abandoned mines canneries and camps about 2000 miles away 
lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and 
death and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in their 
absense 
about 450 aleuts survive and would be eligible for 12000 
payments an additional 20 million would benefit aleut villages 
and provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe

some san diego police officers are 
questioning a former colleagues claim that he was shot and beaten 
up at his home by three men who intended to kill him 
doyle f wheeler a former san diego police lieutenant who once 
testified against a fellow officer in a murder trial denied 
wednesday that he staged the attack he said he was assaulted 
because he testified last year that another san diego police 
officer was a racist 
i know it had something to do with that wheeler told the 
spokesmanreview newspaper of spokane 
it was absolutely physically impossible for me to do it to 
myself it is impossible to hogtie and shoot yourself he said 
however some san diego police oficers cast doubt on wheelers 
version of of how his head was grazed by a bullet in an incident 
tuesday at his home northwest of spokane 
wheeler was treated and released from a spokane hospital said 
stevens county sheriff richard andres 
wheeler was described by assistant san diego police chief bob 
burgreen as a fellow who is really disturbed 
he wheeler reported that someone tried to kill him but 
there was only a graze wound and powder burn burgreen told the 
san diego tribune he was handcuffed tied up and had to dial 911 
with his tounge i find all of this very interesting 
the incident makes no sense said harry o eastus ii a 
police officer and director of the san diego police officers 
association 
based on wheelers past performance there is a strong 
likelihood that he could have done that to himself or paid somebody 
to do it he said 
local authorities have refused to release details about the 
shooting and have declined comment on a possible connection to 
wheelers testimony on behalf of sagon penn a black who was 
acquitted of murder and attempted murder charges in the 1985 
shooting of two san diego police officers 
wheeler testified that the attack was provoked by the white 
officers 
police agent thomas riggs died during the shooting and police 
agent donovan jacobs and a civilian observer sarah pinaruiz were 
wounded 
wheeler who was a member of the san diego force for about 10 
years retired on stress disabilty in 1985

a supreme court ruling that the government may 
continue viewing alcoholism as willful misconduct instead of a 
disease is a decision without any heart but one that will not 
affect the help alcoholics can get a spokesman for the american 
medical association said today 
by a 43 vote the court held wednesday that the veterans 
administration acted properly in refusing to extend educational 
benefits to two veterans who applied more than 10 years after their 
service 
the two men said in their suit they had failed to apply earlier 
for the benefits because they were disabled by their alcoholism 
we think the decision is wrong we think its a decision 
without any heart and a decision which really doesnt treat the 
medical evidence in a very sophisticated way said kirk johnson 
ama general counsel in an interview on cbs this morning 
johnson said the decision would apply only to the va which he 
said has an archaic benefit rule he said society recognizes that 
alcoholism is a disease and is far ahead of the va or the supreme 
court 
the justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism is a 
disease noting that the medical community remains sharply divided 
on that issue 
but the court said the federal rehabilitation act of 1973 does 
not force the va to treat alcoholism as a disease the va said the 
men were suffering from primary alcoholism which is a result of 
willful misconduct 
thomas k turnage director of the va said the ruling supports 
a system of regulations in place for more than 20 years and will 
not affect the way veterans suffering from alcoholism are treated 
in va hospitals and clinics 
its really not going to affect treatment of alcoholism at 
all turnage said in a telephone interview we have a very 
comprehensive program as it deals with alcoholism in our 172 
hospitals and 232 out patient clinics we have a very 
compassionate understanding and concerned alcoholic program for 
veterans who have this malady 
the ruling confirms a va rule that veterans suffering from 
primary alcoholism will not be given special consideration for 
benefits because of their addiction said turnage veterans 
suffering from secondary alcoholism will continue to receive such 
consideration 
turnage said the difference is that secondary alcoholism results 
from an underlying condition such as psychological problems and 
primary alcoholism has no such underlying cause 
experts in the insurance industry said medical insurance 
payments for alcohol rehabilitation will not be affected by the 
ruling and in the medical community treatment of alcoholics will 
remain the same experts said 
lee i dogoloff of the american council for drug education who 
was a carter administration adviser on drug policy said alcoholism 
has all the features of any other disease with a beginning a 
progression and an endstage condition 
though there are different types of alcoholics dogoloff said 
most medical researchers now accept that about 10 percent of 
americans have the genetic vulnerability to become helplessly 
addicted to alcohol 
do you have a choice to take that first drink dogoloff 
said sure but once that threshold is crossed it becomes a 
disease for many alcoholics 
he said companies will continue to support rehabilitation 
efforts because american industry has found that such programs are 
good for business by helping alcoholics stay sober dogoloff said 
companies have increased productivity prevented accidents and 
prevented alcoholrelated health conditions such as liver disease 
that can be expensive to treat 
rob bier a spokesman for the health insurance association of 
america said the ruling is unlikely to affect health insurance 
programs many of which provide benefits for the treatment of 
alcoholism 
health insurance is a contract and if it covers alcohol 
rehabilitation then that will not change no matter what the 
supreme court says bier said 
and a spokesman for alcoholics anonymous who asked not to be 
named said aa will still work with people the way we always 
have 
dr david goldman a scientist at the national institute on 
alcohol abuse and alcoholism said medical researchers have moved 
beyond the fundamental question of whether alcoholism is a disease 
there are diseases that involve choice that are still 
diseases he said an example is coronary artery disease if 
one eats fatty foods it contributes to the disease but it is 
still classified as a disease 
the american medical association defines alcoholism as an 
illness the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental 
disorders a psychiatrists catalogue of diseases lists alcohol 
abuse and dependence 
but norma phillips the national president of mothers against 
drunk driving said the decision should challenge the idea that 
drunks are helpless victims of an uncontrollable disease which she 
said has encouraged some judges to give light sentences for drunken 
driving 
i feel this decision is fair and just and that this encourages 
judges to give sentences to fit the crime of drunken driving she 
said the fundamental issue is responsibility

john demjanjuk convicted of being a 
brutal nazi death camp guard despite his insistence that he was a 
victim of mistaken identity admitted his guilt two years ago a 
us marshal says 
demjanjuk a former cleveland autoworker who was found guilty 
monday by an israeli court of war crimes said in the hearing of 
lee koury and another marshal accompanying him from a federal 
penitentiary in springfield mo to israel in february 1986 
they dont understand it was war i had to do it 
the statement was made almost like he was thinking out loud 
koury said wednesday he was sort of looking out the airplane 
window the statement was not made to the deputy or me 
it was an admission of guilt but i didnt think much of it at 
the time i knew that demjanjuk had fought losing his citizenship 
and being extradited but i did not know that he had denied that he 
was who they believed he was 
and deputy marshal richard schroeder said it was clear to me 
that when he realized he was really going to israel he was trying 
to justify to himself what he had done he was trying to 
rationalize 
demjanjuk was convicted of being the treblinka death camp guard 
known as ivan the terrible for his brutality ivan helped 
operate the gas chambers at the camp in nazioccupied poland where 
850000 jews were killed in 1942 and 1943 according to testimony 
at the 14month trial ivan often exceeded the atrocities ordered 
by his superiors beating prisoners on their way to the gas 
chambers with a metal bar or bayonet 
he is to be sentenced monday and could receive the death penalty 
two days after their arrival in israel koury the us marshal 
for the western district of missouri said israeli prosecutors 
interviewed him and schroeder for four hours about demjanjuks 
statement both officers were listed as trial witnesses though 
they were never called to testify 
he said they also were asked by the justice department and the 
israeli government not to mention the statement until after the 
case was resolved 
koury and schroeder said demjanjuk struck them as a man who knew 
his time was coming 
i remember that when we landed in israel he turned and looked 
me square in the eyes and said youve brought me here to be 
hanged schroeder said 
he seemed a little apprehensive as we were handing him over to 
israeli authorities koury said 
but the only emotion he showed the marshal added was when he 
made that statement they dont understand it was war i had to 
do it

said dr daniel mccabe found scratches in masons mouth and upper 
esophagus more xrays will be analyzed today she said mason was 
released wednesday 
a police report confirmed that pieces of a mouse and glass were 
found in food retrieved from the restaurant by masons mother 
griselda mason 44 of ellicott city 
mrs mason said her son had sent his crab dish back to the 
kitchen to be reheated when the food was returned mason took a 
bite and they both heard a crunching sound she said he began 
to choke stood up grabbed his throat and vomited she said 
an official of the hotel said in a statement wednesday he 
disputed masons story 
our investigation of the matter and interviews with our 
employees gives us no reason whatsoever to believe that there is 
any truth to mr masons charges of either discrimination or 
contaminated food jaap van der vorm vice president of 
alexandria management co which owns the hotel and restaurant 
no one on the property ever saw the contaminated food the 
hotel staff did call the rescue squad when mr mason appeared to 
suffer a seizure in the restaurant at this time we are not 
ruling out the possibility of a hoax van der vorm said 
mason last week filed a complaint with police over six letters 
filled with sexual and racist innuendo he said he believed the 
anonymous letters came from a hotel employee 
county police decided the letters did not constitute a threat 
under state law and referred the case to the fbi as a possible 
civil rights violation 
city councilman carl snowden demanded the us justice 
department investigate whether masons civil rights were violated

georgia law prohibits the execution of murderers 
who were under the age of 17 the state supreme court has ruled 
the courts decision wednesday prohibits the state from seeking 
a death sentence against clinton bankston jr who was indicted in 
clarke county for two murders alleged to have been committed when 
he was 15 years old and for three slayings when he was 16 
bankston is charged with murder in athens in the april 1987 
knife slayings of glenn and rachael sutton two retired university 
of georgia professors and the august 1987 hatchet slayings of 
sally nathanson 59 her daughter helen nathanson 22 and mrs 
nathansons sister ann orr morris 63 
his attorneys say bankston will plead innocent by reason of 
insanity 
at issue in wednesdays supreme court ruling was a statute 
dealing generally with capital cases which includes this provision 
when it is shown that a person convicted of a capital offense 
without a recommendation for mercy had not reached his 17th 
birthday at the time of the commission of the offense the 
punishment of such person shall not be death but shall be 
imprisonment for life 
bankstons attorneys had filed a pretrial motion to prevent the 
district attorney from seeking the death penalty but it was 
rejected by the trial judge 
the court said that the context of the statute did raise a 
question whether the legislature intended only to block the the 
death penalty for those under 17 who were charged with capital 
crimes other than murder such as rape kidnapping and armed 
robbery 
however it said a 1977 us supreme court decision effectively 
blocked the death penalty for all but murder cases

reparations to japaneseamericans interned during world war ii 
would pay a debt of honor although it would not heal all wounds 
said a man who unsuccessfully challenged the mass internment 
like someone whos a victim of a serious accident and becomes 
a quadriplegic no matter whats voted in the way of 
acknowledgement of error itll never be whole gordon 
hirabayashi said wednesday in a telephone interview from edmonton 
canada 
earlier wednesday the senate approved a bill that calls for the 
government to apologize for the mass roundups and make each of the 
estimated 60000 survivors eligible for a taxfree payment of 
20000 the house has passed a similar bill 
after japan attacked pearl harbor on dec 7 1941 about 120000 
japaneseamericans were forced to give up their homes and 
businesses and put in internment camps 
in seattle cherry kinoshita rejoiced after the senate vote 
fortysix years ago she was uprooted from her home and sent to a 
camp in idaho 
pleased would be an understatement she said weve been 
working for over 10 years to see this happen i think its great to 
see our nation admit an error and take steps to remedy what was a 
great injustice 
i think the japaneseamericans have reconciled to the fact 
that certain things have taken place and there are some scars 
said hirabayashi at this stage what they really wanted was an 
acknowledgement that a wrong was done and a vote for an honorable 
redress 
hirabayashis world war ii conviction of resisting curfew and 
violating the military internment order was overturned by a federal 
appeals court in september 
the 9th circuit however refused to rule on the 
constitutionality of the internment which the us supreme court 
had upheld during hirabayashis original appeals in the 1940s 
even though the government has not appealed the latest ruling 
hirabayashi said his lawyers had asked the supreme court to take up 
the case again so the high courts previous decision can be removed 
from the records 
the country doesnt have too many opportunities to redress 
something hirabayashi said when it does i think we should 
take that opportunity and look to the future to keep the honor of 
our country inviolable 
i think that result would be the finishing touch to what the 
japaneseamericans hope that their tragedy will contribute to 
the issue took a long time to be resolved because of the shame 
the japaneseamericans felt at being locked up and the federal 
governments willingness to bury the matter hirabayashi said 
in this case the victims were so traumatized by this 
experience that they had not recovered enough to talk about until a 
decade or so ago he said 
there was nothing in the history books he said now the 
situation is different we have to take some kind of historical 
perspective on this forty years is not all that long 
sam shoji 62 of seattle a social worker for the veterans 
administration who was incarcerated for 13 months said the money 
was only a token but at least it is there 
it was basically a concentration camp said shoji 
ms kinoshita who was 18 when she went with her family to the 
camp at minidoka idaho was one of many japaneseamericans who 
worked to convince the government that internment defied the 
constitution and was a racist act 
we hope this will acknowledge that this was a tragic travesty 
of justice and that with this legislation we can hope that it will 
never ever recur again to another group she said 
rodney kawakami a seattle attorney who has been active in 
seeking redress said the money also was important because there 
are still significant numbers of americans who believe the 
internment was justified because of what the government of japan 
did at pearl harbor 
he said the 20000 was less than what individuals lost in being 
forced to move but was significant enough to carry a message 
rudy tokiwa a wounded veteran of the 422nd regimental combat 
team formed by japaneseamericans in world war ii said the bills 
passage accomplished part of what he and his buddies fought for 
but i wonder whether we will succeed in the rest we went for 
freedom the freedom to be treated the same as americans and there 
would be no such thing anymore as hes an asian or hes a 
german or hes white or hes black tokiwa said in san 
francisco

mustard gases on a large scale during the battle in the faw

minutes after the plane landed at irans nearby abu musa island 
the frigate went to general quarters the navys highest alert 
and crewmen investigated whether the plane had dropped a canister 
of cs riot control gas on the ship nothing was found 
the iranians clashes monday with the us navy and the 
unexpected iraqi recapture of faw the first major iraqi offensive 
in two years have clearly jolted the iranians 
tehran radio said all volunteers known as basij should 
report to bases throughout the country and get ready for 
departure to the battlefront 
the us navy destroyed two iranian oil platforms sank an 
iranian patrol boat crippled two frigates and damaged three other 
attack boats on monday it was the worst usiran clash since the 
navy buildup last july to curb iranian attacks on shipping

were no reported us casualties but the twoman crew of a marine 
helicopter was missing 
irna quoted iranian rear adm mohammedhussein malekzadegan as 
saying the americans fired on crewmen from the frigate joshan who 
had jumped into the water and killed several

the americans shot missiles at iranian crewmen in lifeboats and 
killed several including a marine who had rescued six of his 
comrades 
a us navy officer aboard the williams which was involved in 
mondays fighting said the captain of the sabalan the other

us military teams are scouting pacific and 
southeast asian nations for alternative sites in event new military 
lease agreements cant be reached with the philippines government 
says americas top pacific military commander 
there is a seriousminded successoriented approach to the 
alternatives adm ronald j hays said 
hays said in an interview monday that he has been surprised at 
the intensity of issues being debated in the review of the 1947 
military bases agreement under which the united states maintains 
facilities at clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations in the philippines the agreement expires in 
september 1991 
however im still optimistic about reaching an agreement the 
economic security and political implications associated with our 
departure would be astronomical hays said 
he declined to identify nations which might host us military 
bases 
the problem is that the nations who are forthcoming to us on a 
private basis and who will readily concede that indeed bases at 
clark and subic are important are unwilling for a variety of 
reasons to go public and to take an official public position of 
support for the united states said hays 
the admiral said it would cost 10 billion or more to duplicate 
the facilities in the philippines however he said that less than 
half that amount might be available to prepare alternate bases 
which would mean a reduced us presence in the region

police say they have no suspects in the first 
killing of an officer this year but authorities also opened an 
investigation into why the ambulance carrying him bypassed the 
hospital nearest the shooting 
henry ford hospital officials said they were prepared to treat 
officer paul dunbar jr after being alerted by emergency medical 
service dispatchers but he never arrived 
dunbar 31 died in surgery at 4 am wednesday at detroit 
receiving hospital

communications between ford hospital ems dispatchers and the 
ambulance that picked up dunbar at the shooting scene

his chest in front of a home on the citys north side officer 
allene ray said

zaharoff also said police were not directly involved in the 
ambulance investigation ford hospital is about one mile from where

president pw botha today 
proposed including blacks in the electoral college that chooses the 
president and possibly in the cabinet 
in a major speech to parliament botha stopped far short of 
proposing full black voting rights or abolition of apartheid 
legislation 
but he said his national party would stick to its widely 
criticized program of slowpaced reforms despite claims from the 
increasingly powerful far right that most of the 5 million whites 
oppose even modest concessions to the black majority 
bothas proposal to include blacks on the electoral college 
would if implemented mark the first time that blacks had a direct 
voice in the selection of south africas president he gave no 
details about how much strength blacks might be given on the 
college 
botha also suggested that the cabinet might be opened to people 
not serving in parliament this would clear the way for 
participation by blacks who are excluded from parliament 
bothas initiatives appeared unlikely to ease international 
pressure on south africa for an end to apartheid which establishes 
racially segregated residential areas health services and schools 
and deprives the 26 million blacks of a vote in national affairs 
but domestically bothas message seemed to be that his 
government would not be intimidated by the success of the 
extremeright conservative party in three recent parliamentary 
byelections 
i appeal to everyone to remain calm to restore balance and to 
recognize each others rights he said if we wish to live 
together peacefully in this beautiful land the time has come to 
reflect on what unites us instead of emphasizing that which divides 
us 
botha reiterated his governments longstanding proposal for 
creating a national advisory council on which he and his top 
cabinet ministers would negotiate with black leaders on drafting a 
new constitution that would bring blacks into the central 
government 
we are not committed to the name the form the composition or 
the functions of such a body he said we are committed to the 
concept of a forum for deliberation 
most prominent black leaders have rejected bothas overtures to 
participate in the national council they say the government first 
must free imprisoned black nationalist leaders like nelson mandela 
and lift restrictions on major antiapartheid organizations 
botha became south africas prime minister in 1978 that 
postition was abolished in 1984 with the adoption of a new 
constitution and he was installed as president 
in his speech botha proposed that the office of prime minister 
be revived to handle daytoday governmment affairs so the 
president could be freed to concentrate on major policy matters and 
ceremonial duties 
botha said political progress in south africa would be impeded 
by continued foreign pressure from the international brotherhood 
of persecutors 
he also chided antiapartheid clergymen such as anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu for their increasingly vocal opposition to 
the government and their continuing calls for punitive sanctions 
they take the lead in isolating the republic in economic and 
other fields without caring in the least about the detrimental 
results botha said they accordingly play into the hands of 
the anc 
the outlawed african national congress is the major guerrilla 
movement fighting the government 
the president said only a small fraction of south africas 
christians supported the antiapartheid stance of tutu and other 
clergymen affiliated with the south african council of churches

the trustee of ptl who lost a battle in a 
federal appeals court over the ministrys right to taxexempt 
status says he may pursue further appeals 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 
richmond va on wednesday affirmed a decision by us district 
judge karen l henderson of columbia 
she found that the bankruptcy court where ptl is under 
reorganization proceedings did not have the authority to issue a 
preliminary injunction preventing the irs from lifting the 
taxexempt status 
david clark trustee for the ministry founded by jim and tammy 
bakker said the ruling may be appealed 
our hope is that we have demonstrated good faith to the irs by 
the way the place has been run and the changes that have been 
made to operations and integrity that they might be willing to hold 
off he said 
clark made the comment after a hearing in us bankruptcy court 
during which judge rufus reynolds approved the sale of 32 million 
in ptl property 
lawyers for the fort millbased ministry had argued that the 
loss of the status could scuttle reorganization efforts 
attorneys for the irs said failure to revoke the status could 
cost the government from 55 million to 82 million in back taxes 
the agency is seeking to make the revocation retroactive to may 31 
1981 
a spokesman for the irs in washington steven pyrek declined to 
comment on the agencys next move 
in columbia wednesday reynolds approved the sale of 32 
million worth of property eight houses and some land in the lake 
wylie area 
one of the houses belonged to richard dortch once bakkers top 
aide and sold for 425000 at an auction 
the net gain to the ministry from the sale will be nearly 2 
million according to c edwin allman iii an attorney for clark 
an attorney representing a group of ptl donors said he will 
file within 30 days a class action protesting the sale of any of 
the ministrys property 
robert zanesky of westport conn said the donors 
contributions are worth more than all of ptls property our 
claim will take up everything that ptl owns he said 
reynolds told the people gathered in the courtroom that he has 
been getting telephone calls and letters supporting the return of 
the bakkers 
if youve got any star preference you want to get back in im 
not the one the trustee is the one to decide reynolds said 
it is not the court who employs preachers 
bakker who stepped down from ptl in march 1987 amid a sex and 
money scandal said he wrote reynolds last week requesting a chance 
to help the ministry back to financial stability 
what would it hurt if jim and tammy were given 90 days to see 
what we could do bakker said tuesday in an interview with the 
herald of rock hill if at the end of 90 days i had not helped 
id be glad to walk off into the sunset 
bakker said he was seeking reinstatement as a minister with the 
assemblies of god and is trying to arrange a meeting with members 
of the north carolina assembly in order to mend fences 
bakker also says he still hopes to buil a 2 billion religious 
resort in the desert near coachella calif 
he said wednesday that he has not been able to buy a 1700acre 
site he favors but insisted progress is being made toward 
developing his proposed heritage springs international resort 
either there or elsewhere 
coachella mayor frank duran said a texas developer is interested 
in a country club project on the same land 
the planned resort would include a 1000room hotel three golf 
courses recreational vehicle park a 20000seat auditorium and a 
1200seat theater for religious plays it also would include a 
5000seat television studio 
we need to get back on television to move things along 
bakker said its the old question of the chicken or the egg and 
which comes first

the reagan administration in a statement 
issued on israels 40th anniversary prodded israel and other 
nations in the mideast to move ahead and get to productive peace 
negotiations 
president reagan remains convinced that our peace initiative 
is balanced and offers the only realistic basis on which to make 
progress white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement 
the statement was issued after reagan signed a usiraeli 
memorandum that formalizes the two nations consultative groups and 
their strategic cooperation the groups meet periodically to 
discuss joint military and security assistance as well as economic 
development issues 
the oval office meeting reportedly attended by vice president 
george bush and isaeli ambassador moshe arad was closed to 
reporters 
the memo fitzwater said in a statement reflects the enduring 
us commitment to israels security that commitment will never 
flag 
the president knows that a strong israel is necessary if peace 
is to be possible he also knows that israel can never be truly 
secure without peace 
the statement noted that secretary of state george shultz has 
been asked to pursue the us peace initiative in the region and to 
seek a comprehensive settlement which will assure isareli 
security and provide for the legitimate rights of the palestinian 
people 
shultz has shuttled among the israelis and arabs in recent weeks 
with little success in promoting the us peace plan 
the president reiterates his appeal to the leaders in the 
region not to miss this opportunity to move ahead and get to 
productive peace negotiations this has been an objective that 
israel has fervently sought over the last 40 years fitzwaters

a tribal judge said his dismissal of an 
attorney left him with no choice but to delay a hearing in a 
custody dispute between the navajos and a california couple over a 
9monthold navajo girl 
judge manuel watchman of navajo tribal childrens court on 
wednesday recessed allyssa keetsos temporary custody hearing for 
48 hours after he disqualified a courtappointed lawyer from 
representing the child 
certainly a child has the right to be represented adequately 
at these proceedings and that was the bottom line of this whole 
thing watchman said after the hearing 
a tribal lawyer said it was likely another attorney would be 
named by friday 
attorney robert walters was dismissed after he entered a motion 
to dismiss the temporary custody proceeding 
violet ap lui an attorney representing the tribe declined 
comment 
karen diakun a tribal spokeswoman said watchman placed the 
baby temporarily in the custody of rick and cheryl pitts of san 
jose calif the nonindian couple who have cared for her since 
birth and who want to adopt her 
watchman also ordered them to stay on the reservation ms 
diakun said 
patricia keetso 21 allyssas mother was pregnant and single 
when she contacted the pittses through a newspaper ad she lived 
with them before and after allyssa was born and has said she wants 
the couple to adopt her daughter 
susie keetso the babys grandmother said meanwhile that 
tribal representatives had pressured her to sign papers seeking to 
bring allyssa to the reservation for the custody hearing 
ms diakun said one reason the tribe entered the custody issue 
was a strong desire expressed by the grandparents that they 
wanted the child returned to the reservation 
but mrs keetso said she always has wanted the pittses to adopt 
alyssa the way they talked at me it seemed like they were just 
going to put me in jail or something like that she said 
the tribe intervened in the adoption proceedings under the 
indian child welfare act which gives tribes jurisdiction under 
certain circumstances to determine custody in adoption proceedings

jesse jackson boosted by a 
philadelphia newspapers endorsement plunged into a series of 
north pennsylvania campaign stops today five days before the 
states democratic primary 
first stop was williamsport where he donned a sweatshirt and 
gave enthusiastic students his familiar lecture on avoiding illegal 
drugs and teenage sex leading to pregnancy 
his speech was delayed for a few minutes as students crowded to 
the front of the williamsport area high school gymnasium to get 
photos of jackson in a sweatshirt with williamsport on the 
front 
the night before jackson staged a rally at a plaza across from 
philadelphias city hall where a crowd of 3500 cheered and called 
we want jesse 
the democratic presidential contender appeared undaunted by his 
defeat in new york tuesday at michael dukakis hands 
we have come a long way and we will not turn back he said 
we must go forward we are almost there you keep on holding on 
i want to lead our nation beyond racism beyond sexism beyond 
antisemitism 
i give you a choice i am the alternative in the democratic 
party he said 
jackson was taken aback when told the philadelphia daily news 
an afternoon paper with a circulation of about 252000 was giving 
him its endorsements in todays editions 
i dont believe it he said 
in its editorial the daily news said nominating jesse 
jackson sends a message to the world which is not made up of 
elderly white businessmen no matter what reagan thinks 
social change doesnt happen instantly the editorial said 
it took 32 years after the nomination of al smith to elect a 
roman catholic president if its going to take 32 years after the 
first black nominee its past time to get started especially 
since the black man is the only candidate who seems to understand 
the soul of his own party 
the same newspaper on wednesday joined by the pittsburgh 
postgazette published a poll that showed jackson running 40 
percentage points behind dukakis in pennsylvania there are 178 
democratic delegates at stake in the primary 
jackson declined to comment on the poll saying i do not 
follow opinion polls i mold opinion and thats why i am a leader 
i will take my case to the people 
jackson arrived in philadelphia wednesday afternoon and was 
greeted by mayor w wilson goode the first black mayor in the 
nations fifth largest city 
four years ago the mayor supported jacksons opponent walter 
mondale but he made an early endorsement of jackson this year 
jackson went to the philadelphia nursing home to visit aids 
victims in the lobby he greeted employees and residents stopping 
briefly at the elevator to shake the hand of gregory graland 
paralyzed by a bullet in his spine who was lying on his stomach on 
a stretcher 
he said to me hi brother keep up hope graland said i 
said thank you i meant to wish him good luck but he went by so 
fast 
after a halfhour session with a dozen aids patients jackson 
brought victim drew aller 29 into the lobby 
we need to shift the focus from hysteria to health care 
jackson said urging that more resources be devoted to helping 
victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
im here because i care he said

the real estate mogul took a tour of the decaying 85yearold 
span then said he would be willing to put up an estimated 250 
million which the government would repay for repairs trump 
rebuilt the wollman skating rink under a similar arrangement 
an easy solution is to spend a lot of money but if you can 
spend a little money and get the same results for it or a better 
result thats what id be here for trump said 
the bridge was closed last week when city transportation 
officials found cracks in its beams an inspection is under way to 
determine the extent of the damage and officials have said the 
bridge will be closed at least three weeks 
alfred a dellibovi head of the federal urban mass 
transportation administration had invited trump to examine the 
bridge and joined him for todays tour 
in a letter to trump dellibovi lauded him as a builder whose 
projects come in on time under budget and built to last 
in 1987 trump showed up the city bureaucracy when he took over 
repair of the skating rink and finished the job in five months and 
under budget the city had spent 7 years and 12 million on what 
was supposed to take 2 years and 45 million

joseph j cicippio who has been held 
hostage in lebanon for 19 months has never looked so thin as in a 
photograph released this week relatives said 
this picture sort of shows that he is getting very weak from 
what i can see said thomas cicippio one of five brothers living 
in norristown 
cicippio said wednesday the photograph was very distressing 
to the family particularly because a french hostage released in 
november reported that cicippio was in good health 
hes got a distant look and ive never seen him so thin he 
really looks down and out to me he said 
a group calling itself the revolutionary justice organization 
included the photograph with a threatening statement delivered to a 
beirut newspaper warning of retaliation for us military action 
in the persian gulf this week 
the photograph showed cicippio 57 wearing a navy blue track 
suit he was looking directly into the camera but he wasnt 
wearing his eyeglasses 
thomas cicippio said a us state department official called 
tuesday to tell him about the photograph released by the group 
claiming to hold cicippio and edward austin tracy a vermont writer 
abducted in west beirut in october 1986 
they just informed us there was a new photo released of joe 
and that there were more threats on his life we havent heard any 
more since then said cicippio 64 a retired postal worker who 
has acted as spokesman for his family since the abduction sept 12 
1986 of his brother acting comptroller of the american university 
of beirut

thirtyone hostages freed after 15 days 
aboard a hijacked kuwaiti jumbo jet flew to waiting families in 
kuwait today officials in beirut denied reports that the hijackers 
found haven in beirut 
the 24 passengers and seven crew members from the kuwait airways 
boeing 747 that was seized april 5 left algiers airport at 320 
pm 1220 pm edt they were freed wednesday 
kuna kuwaits official news agency said an official and public 
reception was planned for tonight most of the former hostages are 
kuwaiti 
the hijackers had demanded that kuwait free 17 imprisoned 
terrorists which kuwait rejected but there were reports that 
kuwait agreed to commute the death sentences of three of the 
prisoners 
before the hostages left aboard a kuwait airways boeing 767 
kuwaiti official ahmad fahd said all were found fit to travel after 
medical examinations at the military hospital in algiers fahd was 
sent here to oversee the crisis 
the nine hijackers who had killed two kuwaiti hostages were 
believed to have left algeria after slipping out of the plane ahead 
of the hostages at dawn wednesday 
kuna citing unidentified algerian sources said algerian 
mediators promised the hijackers safe passage to travel to beirut 
or tehran 
western diplomats in algiers speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they believed the hijackers went to beirut 
cbs without naming sources said today that the hijackers had 
arrived in beirut but beirut airport officials also speaking 
privately told the associated press that the hijackers had not 
arrived 
the plane was seized april 5 on a bangkoktokuwait flight with 
112 aboard and diverted to mashhad iran where the terrorists 
released 57 hostages 
freed passengers said they believed more gunmen boarded at 
mashhad with submachine guns and dynamite which was later wired to 
the planes doors 
after three days in mashhad the plan flew to larnaca cyprus 
during five days there the hijackers beat two kuwaiti security 
men shot them to death and dumped their bodies from the aircraft 
the hijackers let 13 more hostages go in exchange for fuel that 
brought them to algiers 
several days before giving up the hijackers freed an ailing 
passenger 
throughout the ordeal the hijackers demanded that the persian 
gulf sheikdom free 17 proiranian extremists imprisoned for the 
1983 bombings of the us and french embassies there 
kuwait steadfastly refused and its rulers were lauded by their 
people on wednesday for standing firm but there was some anger 
expressed in kuwait because the hijackers had been allowed to go 
free 
the deal also provoked criticism from the united states britain 
and the international air transport association a montrealbased 
trade association that represents 170 international airlines 
they are not only hijackers but murderers secretary of 
state george p shultz said in finland on wednesday while en route 
to moscow for presummit talks 
western intelligence officials have said they believe two of the 
hijackers were lebanese nationals under us indictment for the 
1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner in which a us navy diver was 
slain 
rodney wallis security director of the international air 
transport association told the associated press we can assume 
we have not heard the last of the hijackers we now have the 
possibility that a number of trained hijackers could lead missions 
of their own 
neither algeria nor kuwait would disclose terms of the deal 
however nbc news reported that unidentified us officials 
believed the algerians provided the hijackers with letters or tapes 
from the 17 prisoners in kuwait so friends and relatives could see 
the prisoners had not been harmed 
a us official in washington said efforts were made to assure 
the hijackers the 17 were not mistreated but the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity did not confirm the the 
hijackers were given letters or tapes 
kuna said the hijackers left the plane in two shifts 10 minutes 
apart on wednesday the hostages staggered down the gangway 20 
minutes later among them were three cousins of the kuwaiti ruler 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
an algerian air force transport plane force took off shortly 
thereafter it is rare for military aircraft to use the civilian 
houari boumedienne airport and there was speculation hijackers 
were aboard 
algerian officials would not discuss the flight or its occupants 
interior minister hedi khediri who led the algerian mediators 
announced the dramas end without giving details and said the fate 
of the hijackers was the concern of algeria alone 
kuna said the crisis ended without any deal concerning the 
17 imprisoned proiranian extremists but there were reports kuwait 
agreed to commute the death sentences that had been given to three 
of the 17 prisoners 
a kuwaiti official in algiers speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he believed an understanding may have been reached 
that would commute the sentences to life in prison

an amnesty international report on human 
rights accuses colombias armed forces of political repression and 
murder but government officials criticized the study as onesided 
there have been only a few occasional faults or excesses and 
these have been punished as an example for others colombias 
defense minister gen rafael samudio molina told reporters 
wednesday 
in a report released wednesday the londonbased international 
human rights organization accused colombias armed forces of 
engaging in a policy of terror and political murder 
the report said the armed forces plunged the country into a 
human rights emergency by extending political repression to 
encompass not only leftists but anyone who failed to support the 
government forces 
alvaro tirado president virgilio barcos adviser on human 
rights said if the amnesty international report shows the armed 
forces and the government as the only sources of violence in 
colombia then it is onesided 
former foreign minister alfredo vasquez carrizosa president of 
the colombian committee for human rights said he did not share the 
opinion of amnesty when it charged the existence of a deliberate 
policy of political murder in the armed forces he said he had 
no evidence for these charges 
there are paramilitary groups he said these have been 
denounced since 1983 by the attorney general my question is 
why has there been no investigation of those paramilitary groups 
amnesty said that in july and august political repression in 
colombia entered a new phase and the country is in the grip of a 
human rights emergency in those two months anonymously authored 
hit lists of prominent colombians were published and a wave of 
killings of students university lecturers and human rights leaders 
in medellin was reported 
amnesty said hundreds of case studies show that killings and 
disappearances blamed on the death squads were in fact carried 
out by police and military personnel

newly released police files reveal 
that the young woman who reported a girl in a polka dot dress 
running from the scene of robert f kennedys assassination 
admitted two weeks later that she had lied 
you know i thought i was supposed to see more more than i 
did the woman sandra serrano says in microfilmed documents in 
the los angeles police department that could lay to rest 20 years 
of controversy over the report 
meanwhile a former prosecutor said he is certain no photographs 
or investigative matter important to the investigation of the june 
5 1968 assassination were purposely destroyed by police 
there just wasnt any reason for anyone to just deliberately 
destroy something that had any significance the former 
prosecutor now judge lynn d compton of the 2nd district court of 
appeal said wednesday by telephone from a home he has in lopez 
wash 
the files opened at the state archives on tuesday contain a 
certificate that shows 2410 police photographs were burned on aug 
21 1968 chief archivist john burns speculated the photos may have 
duplicated others still in evidence but he said the files contain 
no such statement 
a large portion of the documents deals with miss serrano a 
college student who reported that she had confronted the woman on 
the night of kennedys shooting at the ambassador hotel in los 
angeles 
the files showed that miss serrano first told her story to 
officers at 4 am june 5 at police headquarters in los angeles 
she was one of hundreds of witnesses interviewed 
miss serrano who said she was chairman of the youth for kennedy 
chapter in pasadena said she came to the hotel that night to hear 
kennedy speak but left the embassy ballroom because it was too 
crowded 
she recalled being seated on a step outside when i thought it 
was a backfire of a car i thought i heard six shots six 
backfires 
about half a minute later this girl comes tearing down the 
stairs saying she said we shot him we shot him and i said 
who did you shoot and she said senator kennedy 
she said she had seen the same girl earlier in the evening and 
she was clad in a white voile dress with dark polka dots 
she stood by her story for a time and even went with police to 
the ambassador hotel for a reenactment of her actions the file 
showed but on june 20 1968 when she was reinterviewed by police 
after failing a lie detector test she declared the whole thing 
was a lie 
she suggested that she and other witnesses who told police about 
the polka dot dress had created the story while waiting to be 
interviewed by police she blamed the pressures and excitement of 
the event for her actions 
and she indicated she almost began to believe her own 
fabrication 
i dont know why i said it it just fitted i really 
thought there was something behind it i was conned she said 
the following day june 21 police canceled an allpoints 
bulletin for a woman in a white polka dot dress 
however the story did not die and triggered years of 
controversy over whether sirhan sirhan the man convicted of 
killing kennedy had acted alone

to change the constitutional provision that bars her from holding 
the job 
the proposed amendment passed 70 by the senate government 
committee on wednesday would drop the word male from the list 
of qualifications to be governor attorney general treasurer 
secretary of state and school superintendent

by the senate it would go on this falls election ballot 
as she voted for the bill sen carol macdonald said that when 
she read the arizona constitution recently i came to this clause 
and i about had a stroke 
mrs macdonald said she realized the us constitution took 
precedence over the provision but added nonetheless i think it 
ought to be changed 
committee chairman john mawhinney drew groans from other panel 
members when he joked i wonder whether we could discuss the 
appropriateness of whether we ought to allow females to hold these 
offices 
sen alan stephens wondered how much it would cost to hold the 
public referendum but added that the proposal was something 
thats long overdue 
mrs mofford became governor april 4 when evan mecham was 
removed from office on his impeachment conviction by the state

cattle producers are already turning out much 
leaner beef than many people think and those steaks roasts and 
burgers probably will lose still more flab if consumer demand 
continues says a new study by texas aampm 
moreover although researchers say its hard to tell for sure 
those juicy fastfood hamburgers probably are leaner than they 
sometimes look 
overall the texas aampm study found the amount of visible or 
separable fat was down 27 percent in retail cuts from two years 
ago and the fat content of ground beef was down 10 percent 
the study which was released wednesday by the agriculture 
department involved supermarket surveys in late 1987 and early 
1988 in atlanta chicago dallas denver detroit houston los 
angeles new york city philadelphia seattle tampa fla and 
washington dc 
randomly selected retail beef cuts contained an average of 789 
percent separable lean 117 percent separable fat 33 percent 
external fat and 84 percent seam or intermuscular fat and 
94 percent separable bone and connective tissue 
the weighted average of fat content of all retail beef cuts in 
the 1988 survey was 999 percent compared with 1376 percent fat 
in 1986 
h russell cross of texas aampm told a news conference that while 
americans like beef their perception is that its a fatty product 
earlier studies showed marked improvement in consumer 
perception when the outside fat on retail cuts was trimmed to 
onequarter inch of fat or less compared with the previous 
standard of onehalf inch most retailers began using the 
quarterinch fat trim after 1985 
the reduction in separable fat meant that longstanding 
assumptions on amounts of fat americans were getting from beef 
perhaps were not correct and that more uptodate information was 
needed cross said 
as a result the usdas agricultural research service put up 
20000 the cattlemens beef promotion and research board 
20000 and the beef industry council 5000 for the new study 
the project was administered by a foundation of the national 
cattlemens association 
jeff savell a texas aampm colleague said the study found that 
more than 40 percent of the retail cuts had no external fat 
the average fat thickness on steaks and roasts from primal cuts 
or the major wholesale cuts was 014 inch while the average for 
all cuts from chuck roast to stew meat was 011 inch or less than 
oneeight of an inch he said 
we found that the amount of beef fat in american supermarket 
meat cases on a given day is now 12 million pounds less than in 
former years savell said thats 4 billion fewer calories 
a committee of the national research council recently reported 
that americans are eating too much fat and urged the industry and 
government to help correct the situation by breeding leaner animals 
and changing federal grading regulations 
cross said the latest survey showed that in the case of beef the 
lessfat recommendation of the scientific panel is being carried 
out 
the next step in the war on fat is to trim more of the fat at 
the packer level where it can be done more efficiently he said 
eventually we must depend less on butchers knives to get rid of 
the fat and more on production of leaner cattle 
further changes are needed in the marketing system so that 
cattle producers are rewarded financially for turning out cattle 
with less trimmable fat he said 
cross said the impact of leaner beef on fastfood hamburgers is 
difficult to determine 
first we need to realize that the fastfood ground beef is 
probably not as fat as you might expect he said the average 
fat content is probably somewhere between 18 and 20 percent for the 
fastfood hamburger whereas the average for this study was right 
around 19 percent 
that doesnt mean your favorite juicy burger at the local 
drivein is leaner than the meat bought at supermarkets 
theres essentially three kinds of hamburger that are normally 
offered at retail regular which is around 23 or 24 percent fat 
lean which is around 18 or 19 and extralean in this study 
which was around 14 to 15 cross said so fastfood ground 
beef is right in the middle of the pack

cardinal john oconnor of new york said 
today his mission in cuba was accomplished after a midnight meeting 
with cuban leader fidel castro whom he described as responsive 
the two discussed the relationship between church and state in 
this atheist nation 
the meeting in the presidential palace lasted until about 230 
am oconnor said castro received oconnor at about 11 pm 
after the cardinal celebrated an evening mass in havanas roman 
catholic cathedral 
we discussed the general relationship between the church and 
government here we discussed the possibility of building bridges 
for peace oconnor told reporters as he toured medical clinics 
in havana 
he said casto was especially laudatory of catholic nuns in cuba 
and said the cuban leader expressed delight at the idea of getting 
visas for more to come to the country 
i feel that the mission was accomplished that the president 
recognized clearly my primary purpose for coming here and that was 
to show my solidarity with the bishps of cuba and to show that the 
church in the united states and the church in cuba and throughout 
the world is one church he said 
earlier today thousands of worshipers filled the cathedral for 
the mass 
about 2000 people poured into the 284yearold cathedral in 
havanas colonial district for oconnors first mass in the 
capital church bells rang and the applause was deafening as a 
procession of 75 whitecloaked clergymen walked slowly toward the

as the cardinal neared the altar a man grabbed his hand and 
kissed it 
the procession included all seven of cubas roman catholic 
bishops and monsignor raul del valle of the new york archidocese a 
cuban native who returned to his homeland on tuesday for the first 
time in 27 years 
there has been a mistake oconnor said jokingly in spanish 
addressing the huge crowd youve welcomed me as a pope but i am 
only a cardinal a poor cardinal 
reporters barely got a chance to hear the cardinal speak before 
they were hussled to a bus and taken to the presidential palace 
gerald costello editor in chief of catholic new york a weekly 
catholic newspaper briefed reporters at the palace on the 
cardinals remarks 
oconnor departed from his prepared text several times once to 
introduce del valle who he said was suffering from cancer 
we have great hope that there could be a miracle and we hope 
so because he is an inspiration hes a saint and an inspiraton 
the cardinal said 
oconnor also called it a miracle that del valle had been 
allowed back in cuba after leaving in 1961 for the united states 
he thanked the cuban government for allowing del valle to visit his 
homeland 
repeating the theme of his fourday cuban trip oconnor said 
the church must be allowed to serve as a bridge between people 
regardless of political ideology 
i hope that peace will come to the peoples of the united 
states and the peoples of cuba oconnor said but peace is not 
possible without justice for everyone

business times the acrimonious new york primary campaign is 
over and finally the democrats have a reasonably clear 
frontrunner for the presidential nomination massachusetts 
governor michael dukakis still from a longdistance perspective 
american politics appears to be suffering from a despairing lack of 
leadership at the beginning of the marathon campaign americans 
had the luxury of choosing from a gaggle of candidates yet the 
voters seem to waffle first to this one then to that one the 
problem appears not to have been too many possibilities but the 
lack of a distinct choice 
now that the field has been presumably narrowed to just two 
frontrunners dukakis and vice president george bush whose 
republican nomination needs only the sound of a gavel perhaps the 
candidates can stop defending their electability and start showing 
their leadership qualities the voters are waiting and the rest of 
the world is watching

gov michael s dukakis today signed into law a 
bill that will make massachusetts the nations laboratory in 
ensuring that health insurance is available to all residents by 
1992 
dukakis who has cited the measure in his campaign for the 
democratic presidential nomination said the firstinthenation 
law will erase the uncertainty too many people face when they or 
a loved one becomes ill but lack the means to pay for the cure 
in written remarks for an elaborate statehouse signing ceremony 
the governor said we have good reason to rejoice today as we 
again become the nations laboratory 
the proposal makes massachusetts the nations pathfinder 
blazing a trail that leads to affordable quality health care for 
every man woman and child 
we have made a start here at home he said now we must 
make it work and then we must carry the message of health care for 
all across the country so that the other 49 states join us 
only hawaii which has a federal exemption allowing it to 
mandate employer health coverage currently has anything comparable 
to the massachusetts law 
however the new legislation which statehouse aides say has 
generated inquiries from more than 20 states goes beyond hawaiis 
approach by offering health security both to working and 
nonworking residents 
the massachusetts proposal to make health insurance available to 
all by 1992 will cost the state 6452 million over the next five 
years according to figures released wednesday by dukakis 
the bill the outcome of a ninemonth legislative struggle 
comes two years after massachusetts voters endorsed a nonbinding 
referendum by a 21 margin urging congress to enact a national 
health care program that is universal in coverage 
the thrust of the bill is to provide coverage to an estimated 
600000 massachusetts residents under age 65 currently without 
health insurance about one out of every 10 people in the 
commonwealth 
the plan is to do this in stages and through a variety of 
approaches from extending medicaid benefits for disabled adults 
and children to statebrokered pooled insurance for small 
businesses and individuals 
dukakis health policy adviser catherine dunham said she hopes 
the coverage will begin operations july 1 the start of the fiscal 
year 
the plan passed the legislature last week by narrow margins 
blamed on the deletion of some special interest amendments and 
lingering doubts about how much the law will cost 
although fully prepared to sign the law dukakis as late as 
tuesday was telling reporters he didnt know the bills ultimate 
cost dukakis acknowledged wednesday that there had been some 
confusion about health care costs 
sorry i didnt have the information yesterday but im not a 
technocrat im a leader dukakis said joking about his national 
image as a dispassionate handson manager 
on tuesday the governor swept to victory in new yorks primary 
solidifying his chances of becoming the partys nominee in next 
falls presidential election 
even the chief drafters of the bill the senate and house ways 
and means committees were unable to agree on the measures cost 
the senate placed the states cost at about 550 million and the 
house estimated it as high as 12 billion 
dukakis presented figures wednesday showing the states share of 
the plan would rise from 345 million this fiscal year to 1954 
million in fiscal 1991 
the states share is expected to drop to 1627 million in 
fiscal 1992 according to the governors figures but dukakis and 
dunham said state costs beyond fiscal 1989 are hard to estimate 
because they will depend on how many employers decide to offer 
health plans as a result of the law

return seven overdue library books says that she did return the 
books but authorities said today that five were still missing 
lorelei bennett 33 was arrested when she failed to acknowledge 
a summons to appear in court to answer the charge of unauthorized 
use of property kennebec county district attorney david crook said 
its unfortunate this had to go as far as it did oakland 
police sgt ralph sabins said today but when you fail to appear 
in court its more or less contempt of court and authorities have 
to take action 
bennett was released tuesday on 5480 bond which included a 
fee for the books sabins said 
bennett said police told her she would not have to answer the 
summons if she returned the books so she put five books in the 
librarys overnight deposit box two more books were later added to 
the list of overdue books 
sabins said five of books were still missing today and that two 
of those that were returned were badly damaged

massachusetts gov michael dukakis leading jesse 
jackson in the democratic presidential race said today that 
finishing second in the primaries does not entitle anyone to second 
spot on the national ticket he said that he alone if nominated 
will pick his running mate 
what youre looking for is somebody who first and foremost 
could be a firstrate president if something happened to the 
president thats where you begin dukakis said in an interview 
with the associated press 
if i were to finish second it wouldnt entitle me to anything 
more than consideration period dukakis said 
he refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer 
questions about the vice presidency away from jackson 
i have spent literally zero time thinking about it and i will 
not unless and until i have either won the nomination or it looks 
as if its pretty well in hand dukakis said 
if that happens then i will begin what i hope will be a 
thoughtful and thorough process of selecting a running mate but 
im not going to do anything on that quite literally until the 
california and new jersey primaries are over he continued 
dukakis who leads in nominating delegates and in popular votes 
was asked about a statement from jackson campaign manager gerald 
austin that if dukakis won the nomination the runnerup would 
deserve consideration for the second spot on the ticket 
the nominee makes that decision as he jackson himself 
said and rightly so dukakis said 
since his solid victory in the new york primary over jackson and 
sen albert gore jr on tuesday dukakis has become the focus of 
speculation about his choice for a vice president 
according to aides jackson and dukakis have not discussed the 
issue in any of their private conversations publicly both men 
insist that the question is premature until the nominating process 
has produced a democratic nominee 
dukakis was leaving tonight for pennsylvania and ohio for 
campaign stops pennsylvanias primary is tuesday ohios is a week 
later the governor had events scheduled this evening in pittsburgh 
and cleveland 
dukakis who has been spending three to four weekdays in the 
statehouse each week while running his democratic presidential 
campaign noted wednesday that vice president george bush isnt in 
a position to campaign full time either 
i would assume and expect that the vice president has to spend 
some substantial portion of his week making sure he knows whats 
going on that hes fully briefed dukakis told reporters at a 
statehouse news conference so both of us have the same problem 
dukakis who bested jackson by 14 percentage points in new york 
was treated like a conquering hero when he came back to boston 
dozens of statehouse staffers thronged the governors outer 
office shortly after noon and let out a cheer for the governor and 
his wife kitty 
we love you all dukakis responded 
later at a statehouse reception marking the enactment of a 
state highway package he won warm cheers from the legislators and 
contractors assembled for the event 
transportation secretary frederic salvucci introduced dukakis as 
the next president of the united states dukakis grinned but 
cautioned steady as she goes

lc hadnott 71 of los angeles was in surgery thursday at 
california medical center said administrative supervisor marlene 
delp doctors were not sure whether his arm could be saved she 
said 
the shooting in south central los angeles occurred just after 
the sweep of three alleged sites of rock cocaine sales began late 
wednesday said police officer jim farris 
the elderly suspect was carrying a shotgun when officers broke 
into the house where narcotics were being sold and pointed the 
weapon at them farris said one of our officers responded by 
firing his shotgun injuring the suspect 
hadnott was arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly 
weapon on a police officer farris said 
pamela perkins 26 of los angeles was also arrested she was 
booked for investigation of felony drug possession farris said 
police seized a small amount of drugs three shotguns two 
pistols and a rifle in the raids farris said 
the houses had been linked to violent street gangs farris said 
but he couldnt tie the suspects to a gang 
the rock houses where dealers sell the type of cocaine known 
as rock or crack are primarily in impoverished 
southcentral neighborhoods 
police began using the motorized battering ram because the 
metalfortified doors and windows made it difficult to get inside 
to serve search warrants following court challenges by 
civilrights groups police must now obtain a judges permission 
each time they want to use the ram

an fbi agent learned how close he had come 
to being killed in a shootout with a polygamist clan when a 
30caliber slug was found in his jacket during a courthouse 
security check 
agent donald c roberts turned three ugly shades of gray 
wednesday when the xray at the courthouse door found the slug in 
the lining of his flight jacket said assistant us attorney david 
schwendiman he was shocked 
roberts who had come to court to testify against members of the 
clan took the coat to the us attorneys office and the slug was 
cut out of the lining 
the slug will be compared with six spent rounds retrieved at the 
scene of the shootout and two 30caliber rifles found in the 
bedroom of defendant john timothy singer us attorney brent ward 
said 
singer clan leader addam swapp 27 matriarch vickie singer 
44 and swapps brother jonathan swapp 20 are standing trial on 
federal charges stemming from the jan 16 bombing of a mormon 
chapel and 13day standoff that ended in the shootout 
today the jury put on headphones for the second time in the 
trial and watched on a television monitor a videotape of the 
shootout that was taken by summit county reserve deputy grant j 
evans who had been stationed 500 yards away from the singer 
compound 
the tape did not show any individuals running or shooting but a 
sequence of 11 gunshots was heard along with the deputys surprised 
reaction jesus christ the tape was a twominute excerpt from 
evans coverage of the gun battle 
summit county detective joe offret who had testified earlier 
was recalled to the stand offret said he was the first officer to 
inspect the home where the fbi arrest team was stationed during the 
shootout when he examined the site he found five 30caliber 
bullets a number of bullet strike marks and a 9mm casing 
the gunbattle occurred as agents were attempting to capture the 
swapp brothers with attack dogs state corrections lt fred house 
was killed and addam swapp was wounded 
roberts had been with a team of surveillance agents stationed in 
the home of don and miriam jepsen when a second fbi team 
implemented the arrest plan 
roberts said he was watching through a window when the swapp 
brothers walked back to the main singer residence from a goat pen 
and the order was given to release the dogs 
seconds later roberts testified he heard a loud explosion of 
gunshot immediately in front of my face and felt a sharp pain in 
his upper chest 
i recalled saying im hit im hit another agent jumped 
on roberts and began searching for wounds but none was found 
roberts then resumed his position in front of the window he said 
no bullet marks were found on the jacket or on his body armour 
vest at the time roberts said and he thought he had been hit by a 
fragment of a wall 
it was my impression that had i been hit with a bullet it 
wouldve penetrated the vest and i would not be here today 
roberts said 
earlier wednesday an fbi agent stationed with roberts in the 
jepsen house testified that jonathan swapp pointed a rifle at him 
agent hal g metcalfe said swapp knelt in the snow and aimed but 
the agent recalled seeing no muzzle flashes

secretary of state george p shultz assured two 
dozen jewish refuseniks and other soviets with human rights 
complaints thursday that president reagan and his successor will 
champion their cause 
its built into us shultz said at a gathering at the us 
embassy after listening patiently to stories of refused visas 
separated families and scientists who long ago stopped doing 
sensitive work for the soviet government 
he also gave human rights the pride of place on his agenda 
leading off with the subject at his meeting with foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
i have to keep working at this to keep striving to never 
give up shultz said 
with a quaver in his voice he continued i can promise you 
that the president and whoever succeeds him it built into us 
will keep working at these human rights problems 
shultz said he would pursue the subject friday with mikhail s 
gorbachev 
at about the same time that he was meeting with the refuseniks 
invited to the embassy others trying to press their emigration 
appeals in a demonstration at the lenin library were dragged away 
and taken to a police station in buses 
the crackdown on an unsanctioned public protest may have been 
intended as a warning against such demonstrations during reagans 
visit here next month 
jewish emigration in march hit a 15month high with 984 people 
leaving the country but shultz is trying to force radical changes

started 368 days 42 witnesses and 8 million ago and attorneys 
say it is likely to last at least a year more 
and that doesnt include the 18month preliminary hearing 
welcome to the year no 2 of our trial superior court judge 
william pounders said wednesday the judge and attorneys then spent

the state supreme court dealt a 
multimilliondollar setback to businesses and insurers today 
ruling that the 1986 deep pockets initiative which limited 
damages for pain and suffering did not apply to cases pending when 
the measure passed 
the 43 ruling was a victory for injury victims and their 
lawyers in cases where the harm had occurred but the lawsuits had 
not yet been completed by june 1986 when state voters approved 
proposition 51 by a 62 percent majority 
one class of cases particularly affected by todays ruling is 
asbestos lawsuits many of which had been filed but not settled by 
june 1986 
the court ruled that the initiative was constitutional 
rejecting trial lawyers claims that it discriminated unfairly 
against injury victims but in the key portion of the ruling the 
majority said the measures new standards for determining 
noneconomic damages applied only to injuries suffered after the 
initiative passed 
the opinion by justice john arguelles cited the commonsense 
notion that it may be unfair to change the rules of the game in the 
middle of the contest he also said new laws are generally 
presumed to apply only to future cases 
proposition 51 sponsored by businesses insurers and local 
governments and opposed by trial lawyers limits a defendants 
share of noneconomic damages pain suffering and emotional 
distress to its percentage of the total fault 
under the initiative if a company that is 40 percent 
responsible for an injury for example has gone out of business by 
the time of suit the victim can collect no more than 60 percent of 
the noneconomic damages from the remaining defendants 
economic damages such as medical costs and lost wages are 
still covered by the longstanding deep pockets rule under 
which one or all of the remaining defendants can be required to pay 
100 percent of the costs

a homeless man embittered about cuts 
in his pension payments on thursday seriously damaged three 
paintings by german master albrecht duerer by spraying them with 
sulfuric acid from a champagne bottle 
art restoration experts worked feverishly to save the 
multimilliondollar paintings 
a 51yearold homeless pensioner turned himself in to officials 
at munichs alte pinakothek museum after spraying sulfuric acid on 
the duerer classics mourning of christ and the paumgartner 
altar police said 
duerer considered the most influential artist of the german 
school painted the works between 1496 and 1504 
he told police he destroyed the paintings out of revenge 
because of decreases in his pension payments deductions had been 
made from the mans pension to pay for similar attacks he made on 
paintings in duesseldorf and hamburg police said 
the man described himself to police as psychologically 
disturbed according to police officials who asked not to be 
identified citing policy 
meanwhile a bavaria state art administration director told the 
associated press that the damage done to the works was very 
distressing 
the altar alone is worth 70 million marks about 40 million 
the value has sunk by at least 30 percent said hubertus von 
sonnenburg director of the bavaria state painting collections 
organization but in terms of art history you cant even assess 
this damage 
the paintings can certainly be restored but there were so 
many damaged areas one can never paint them over again so than 
one doesnt see them sonnenberg added 
police said the pictures were as much as 70 percent destroyed 
art restoration experts from munichs doerner institute rushed 
to the museum shortly after the 10 am attack 
the paintings will have to dry out for at least two months 
before the specialists can begin restoration work said institute 
chemist johann koller 
the embittered pensioner was described by witnesses as a 
welldressed gentleman who appeared to be just an ordinary 
museum visitor a school group came upon him as he stood before the 
duerer works spraying the pictures with acid from a small 
champagne bottle 
when a pupil cried out to stop him the man calmly put away the 
bottle and turned himself in to museum officials witnesses said

the national police agency has asked interpol to 
aid the hunt for 26 suspected members of the japanese red army to 
try to prevent terrorist acts during the 1988 olympics an agency 
official said thursday 
a list naming the 26 was sent wednesday to parisbased interpol 
the international criminal police organization said the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said the list included updated portraits of seven members 
based on information obtained recently by the japanese police 
agency 
the official said police feared the revolutionary group would 
carry out terrorist acts inside and outside japan because of the 
olympic games in neighboring south korea 
he said the request would help the search for red army members 
in each of interpols 146 member nations 
the national police agency also plans to distribute 10000 
posters and leaflets describing the wanted members to japanese 
embassies and offices of local companies abroad including 
airports the official said 
he said the list includes fusako shigenobu 42 suspected of 
masterminding the 1972 machine gun attacks at tel avivs lod 
airport that killed 28 people 
police in naples italy said ms shigenobu may have been 
involved in the explosion of a car bomb car outside a us military 
club in naples last week the blast killed an american servicewoman 
and four italians 
junzo okudaira another red army member also is on the 
international wanted list because he is suspected in the bombing 
the official said 
the asahi evening news quoted an unidentified police official as 
saying the red army sent a letter to a news agency in west beirut 
on saturday saying it and okudaira were not involved in the 
bombing the police official refused comment 
he said takamaro tamiya 45 who led a hijacking of a japanese 
domestic airliner to north korea also is on the interpol list

airways jetliner in september 1970 and fled to north korea after 
freeing all the passengers

korea but did not give the cause of death 
the japanese police official said police were aware of a letter 
that tamiya apparently sent to japanese news media last month the 
letter said that the remaining members in north korea would go 
anywhere if ordered to participate in terrorist acts 
the officer declined to provide further details 
the foreign ministry has said that a japanese arrested april 12 
on the new jersey turnpike with pipe bombs in his car also is 
suspected of being a member of the red army

former gov evan mecham ousted from 
office april 4 by the senate will be a delegate to the state gop 
convention and hopes to be picked as one of arizonas 33 delegates 
to the republican national convention 
of course he replied with a smile wednesday night when 
asked whether hed expected to be sent to the state convention from 
his district meeting 
as a precinct committeeman mecham automatically was among the 
182 candidates on the ballot in his district for 38 slots at the 
may 14 state meeting 
he garnered 61 of 102 possible votes and word of his win was 
greeted with applause 
mecham who has clashed with much of the state gops hierarchy 
said he had not tried to count votes in advance of the district 
meeting 
heavens if ive got to line up votes im not interested in 
going he said if i havent earned the right to go to the 
national convention our party is in bad shape 
mechams name was on the list recommended by the rev pat 
robertsons campaign but was omitted from the list of 
recommendations circulated by supporters of vice president george 
bush who already has enough delegates from other states to ensure 
nomination 
the former governor said he expected to back bush eventually 
calling him the only show in town 
even if mecham doesnt win a seat as a delegate to the national 
convention he probably could get in as a former gop governor 
state chairman burton kruglick said

president francois mitterrand and premier jacques 
chirac leading candidates in the first round of the presidential 
election sunday have piqued other hopefuls by arguing over terms 
of a oneonone debate 
as the official campaign entered its last two days thursday 
both the 71yearold socialist president and his 55yearold 
conservative premier already were setting their sights on the may 8 
runoff 
that attitude did not sit well with former centerright premier 
raymond barre 64 running third in the polls 
the game is not over said barre adding he believed it was 
presumptuous not to say curious for his competitors to set a 
date for a debate before the french people have decided 
george marchais the communist party secretarygeneral 
expressed the frustration of other candidates the day before 
yesterday yesterday and today one question occupies the radio and 
television commentaries the mitterrandchirac debate between the 
first and second rounds 
in other words the first round is already over said 
marchais whose partys candidate is andre lajoinie 
french elections are run in two rounds if as expected no 
candidate wins an absolute majority sunday the two top 
votegetters face each other in a runoff 
under french law no polls are allowed to be published in the 
week immediately preceding an election the last polls showed 
mitterrand with comfortable lead at about 35 percent to 37 percent 
followed by chirac with 22 percent to 24 percent barre is third 
with about 17 percent and extreme right national front leader 
jeanmarie le pen has 12 percent 
there are five other candidates in the first round 
the polls vary widely and some show as much as 20 percent of 
the vote undecided 
as the campaign for the first round drew to a close discussion 
focused on the date and format for an eventual debate 
mitterrand said he thought thursday of next week would be fine 
but added any confrontation involving a president and a premier 
should be dignified 
on thursday chirac rejected mitterrands proposed debate date 
and preferred the beginning of the second week between the two 
rounds 
it is not for one candidate to set the date and summon the 
other the premier said this debate must occur at a moment 
when the french people are really mobilized 
responding with thick irony mitterrand said he was very open 
about the date but at the moment he had nobody to talk to 
i must address myself to the different candidates who could be 
present in the second round he said that is a difficult 
conversation to have seriously before sunday night 
the polls indicated mitterrand would defeat either chirac or 
barre in the second round though the gap was narrowing 
a televised debate which has become a tradition in presidential 
politics is vastly more important to chirac who hopes it will 
help him gain ground mitterrand has much more to lose and must 
avoid a serious gaffe 
chirac head of the conservative rally for the republic party 
is a tough debater mitterrand no doubt has not forgotten how 
chirac ran roughshod over former socialist premier laurent fabius 
in a televised debate before the 1986 legislative elections 
chirac says he doesnt want an americanstyle debate with the 
two men questioned separately by a panel of journalists he wants a 
headon confrontation mitterrand would prefer a less direct method 
analysts have called the presidential campaign lackluster and 
without any real discussion of the issues candidates have spoken 
about priorities and general orientations but none of them 
has proposed any refreshing new ideas on how to tackle frances 
economic and social problems 
mitterrand is seeking a second sevenyear term in the elysee 
palace chirac who also served as premier from 197476 under 
president valery giscard destaing is making his second run for 
the presidency barre who replaced chirac as giscards premier is 
running for the first time 
mitterrand defeated giscard in the presidential election may 10 
1981 
on friday the twoweek official campaign ends during that 
period each candidate has a specifically allotted amount of time 
on radio and television and campaign meetings intensify 
no political advertising is allowed on radio and television on 
saturday before the election no campaigning is permitted 
there are 383 million eligible voters

murderers the hijackers are brought to justice our objective is 
to make sure they do not go unpunished she said

peter calcott will leave his test tubes 
behind this summer to help feed hogs on a farm as part of a 
nationwide program to introduce scientists to the farmers they help 
the reason for the pilot program dubbed adoptascientist 
is that many scientists have never seen a farm and for all they 
know cotton grows in pots says ann sorenson of the american 
farm bureau federation 
calcott is one of eight researchers from agricultural products 
companies who will be matched with farmers across the country 
we hope he gets ideas and sees the needs out here in the 
country said carol meyer whose farm calcott will visit we 
want him to see what we do so hell know how vital his research 
is 
scientists will also be visiting farms in illinois new jersey 
texas mississippi new york and perhaps other states 
the farmers in turn may visit the scientists labs to get a 
better understanding of how technology can help them said 
sorensen assistant director of the natural and environmental 
resources division of the farm bureau 
mrs meyer and her husband glenn raise corn and soybeans but 
the main enterprise on their 240acre randolph county farm is hogs 
calcott works at monsanto co in st louis on improving swine 
nutrition and getting hogs to market weight more efficiently 
i am a scientist involved all my life in laboratory work 
and i dont really have any onfarm experience with animals said 
calcott a native of london who has taught biochemistry and 
molecular biology at universities 
i want to understand issues that are important to the meyers 
what improvements they need 
the scientists will be visiting at crucial times such as 
planting and harvest 
farmers notice every little thing and they will point out 
anything strange like a bug on a leaf and sure enough it turns 
out to be something new said sorensen they can turn on a 
lightbulb for the scientists 
mrs meyer said she and her husband would show calcott how they 
raise corn and soybeans two important ingredients in livestock 
rations and how they care for their hogs 
well make him one of the family and hell do some of the 
work she said were excited about this we just need a better 
understanding among all of us in agriculture

the fcc today ordered two california 
dialaporn operators to pay fines totaling 12 million for 
failing to restrict access of obscene messages to children and 
nonconsenting adults 
its time we took steps the ultimate in sleaze deserves the 
ultimate penalty said fcc commissioner james h quello 
they need to know we mean business 
the companies audio enterprises inc and intercambio inc 
were each fined 600000 for violation of statues banning the 
interstate transmission of obscene material and failure to restrict 
such transmissions from minors and nonconsenting adults the 
maximum fine is 50000 for each day of violation 
an fcc spokesman gerald brock said the 600000 fines were 
based on the amount of money the companies made during the 
commissions monitoring process 
in an 11month period audio enterprises made 650000 off calls 
to one line the spokesman said 
todays order resulted from an fcc investigation triggered by 
complaints alleging that unimpeded access to the messages resulted 
in the molestation of one 10yearold girl and so disturbed one 
teen he had to enter weekly psychiatric therapy 
the companies have 30 days to pay or seek reduction of the fine 
earlier commission dialaporn rules had mandated the 
blocking of such messages through access codes message 
scrambling or use of credit card numbers 
upon being notified last december of the complaints both 
companies said they did not have the capacity to provide access 
screening and denied the messages were obscene intercambio also 
argued that it had not violated the regulation because it never 
intended to transmit interstate or to minors 
the commission staff is investigating complaints about two other 
dialaporn companies ramrod enterprises inc and 2001 
enterprises

president roh taewoo said thursday 
the 1988 olympics in seoul will force north korea to change its 
hardline communist policy and reopen a dialogue with south korea 
roh said if north korea changes its longstanding policy to make 
the korean peninsula communist through military force south korea 
would move actively to improve relations 
the olympics are dictating changes in the situation of this 
part of the world and i therefore believe that north koreas 
policy would also inevitably change roh told a nationally 
televised news conference 
roh said relations would reach an epochal turning point in 
four or five years and said he hoped he could lay a firm 
foundation for unification 
despite the november bombing of a south korean civilian airliner 
in an attack south korea blamed on north korean agents seoul and 
pyongyang have been talking and must keep channels open he said 
roh who took office feb 25 did not say what channels the two 
korean states were using for dialogue but he said the most 
effective way to solve problems is summit talks 
rohs predecessor chun doohwan proposed a summit with north 
korean president kim ilsung on many occasions but the pyongyang 
government turned him down 
the korean peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
anticommunist south korea in 1945 at the end of world war ii they 
fought a bloody civil war from 1950 to 1953 
they have held intermittent talks since the early 1970s their 
latest dialogue was broken off in 1986 when north korea disputed a 
major joint ussouth korea military exercise 
relations took another nosedive last november when a korean air 
jetliner disappeared near burma killing all 115 people on board 
a north korean agent in the custody of south korean intelligence 
authorities confessed in seoul in january that she and a male agent 
put a time bomb on the plane to disrupt the olympics in seoul 
roh deplored the bombing but said his government still needs to 
promote dialogue with north korea to avoid a possibly more tragic 
incident 
roh also said increasing violence in the national assembly 
elections would be suppressed 
whoever violates the law and destroys democratic order must be 
punished severely in the name of people roh said 
roh said his governing democratic justice party needs a majority 
in the 299member national assembly in elections next tuesday 
top opposition leaders have said that if the party tries to rig 
the elections they will call for violent protests similar to those 
in june that forced democratic reforms 
the ruling party will face popular resistence and disobedience 
if its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue said 
opposition leader kim daejung of the party for peace and democracy 
rival opposition leader kim youngsam of the reunification 
democratic party said he would have to make a grave decision if 
the government cheated 
roh was elected in december when the two kims split the 
opposition vote 
corruption and violence are among major campaign issues in the 
legislative elections the first test of public confidence in the 
roh government 
government officials say 15 people have been arrested for 
involvement in campaign violence including six members of rohs 
party another 120 people were charged but not jailed for violating 
election laws they said 
in keeping with a campaign pledge roh publicly declared his 
personal wealth at 693000 
the president also said he would lead a clean public life during 
his single fiveyear term and would not tolerate any attempts by 
his relatives to sell influence or make an illicit fortune during 
his tenure

jesse jackson accepted defeat in new york as 
he has accepted his wins and losses in other states graciously 
and with a call for democratic unity 
he praised the campaign of the winner michael dukakis and said 
that during the rest of the primary season there must be a 
measure of competition a measure of cooperation as the democrats 
keep our eyes on the bigger prize victory in the november 
general election 
it was consistent with the hightoned campaign jackson has 
carefully crafted in which he has stayed above the fray even 
during the past week when under attack by new york mayor edward 
koch 
his demeanor has been noticed within the democratic party where 
once he was considered a polarizing force 
i think democrats all over the country are giving jackson high 
marks for his conduct during the campaign said william carrick 
who managed rep richard gephardts presidential campaign until the 
missouri congressman dropped out last month in fact carrick said 
jackson has had a unifying effect on the race 
from the very beginning of the year jesse has tried to keep 
to the high road he has not been critical its been a deliberate 
conscious effort he said 
jackson in 1988 stands in contrast to the candidate who in 
earlier years attacked democratic party rules as exclusionary 
alienated jewish voters and cavorted around the world grabbing the 
spotlight by meeting with controversial figures including cubas 
fidel castro and nicaraguas daniel ortega 
in his earlier years he obviously was a protester this time 
he has grown tremendously and has grown into the protecter of the 
high road said jackson adviser bert lance who was a member of 
former president carters inner circle 
jackson adviser ann lewis said many democratic leaders had 
commented to her about how tough it must have been not to 
respond to kochs assertions that jews would have to be crazy 
to vote for jackson and kochs allegation that jackson lied about 
his proximity to dr martin luther king jr when king was slain in 
1968 
theres a real appreciation that he held back said lewis 
and in fact jackson discussed it she said he said that it 
was hard but he knew he was doing the right thing and that he 
had told her more than a year ago that he was determined not to 
engage in negative campaigning 
in new york jackson did say some people are making hysteria 
while im making history 
the jackson strategy aimed at putting a democrat in the white 
house in november also is devised to make jackson a party insider 
rather than the outsider he was in 1984 
its very important to him and his participation in the 
campaign to be seen as a positive force for the party carrick 
said 
jacksons campaign manager gerald austin said he saw a 
maturation process over the last four years and said that 
because of the way jackson has conducted himself he is considered a 
major player in party politics by the other major players 
in debates among the democratic contenders jackson has relished 
the role of the peacemaker as some of his rivals squabbled he has 
insisted that democrats should aim their fire at the republicans 
and frequently contends internal party wrangling cost them the 
white house in previous elections 
even after the super tuesday contests across the south where 
jackson had reason to gloat after pulling the most votes and 
polling second in the delegate count he put in a plug for party 
unity he called on what was then a hefty field of democratic 
contenders not to self destruct by attacking one another 
not only does jackson refrain from attacking his opponents he 
regularly telephones them said campaign manager austin 
theres a kind of camaraderie that exists he said 
jackson pledges that as he did in 1984 he will work hard for 
the democratic ticket even if he is not on it 
that would stand him in good stead down the road especially if 
a democratic administration takes over hes doing all the right 
things for his future carrick said 
austin commented that jackson at 46 is still a young man and 
hes going to be around for a long time

president reagan five weeks before 
meeting with mikhail gorbachev said today that the united states 
and the soviet union cannot have a normal relationship unless 
moscow changes its ways and stops interfering in nations such as 
afghanistan 
reagan in a wideranging speech on ussoviet ties listed a 
variety of concerns for both superpowers including arms control 
the famine ravaging ethiopia and the peace process in central 
america 
on arms control the president urged the senate to ratify the 
treaty banning mediumrange nuclear missiles signed at the last 
ussoviet summit before he and gorbachev meet may 29 in moscow 
he spoke hours after senate majority leader robert c byrd said 
the senate wont rush to ratify the treaty despite white house 
pressure to do so by the summit 
the treaty is not scheduled to go to the senate floor until may 
9 
later in a questionandanswer session with his audience at the 
world affairs council meeting reagan said that it would be very 
upsetting and would put a strain on the summit if the senate has 
not ratified the treaty by the time we go to moscow 
we hope and pray that they will but their scheduling of it 
has been such that i am very concerned we may have to go without 
having had it ratified he said 
but the president added we dont want a fast treaty we want 
a good one 
as for relations with a nation reagan once labeled the evil 
empire he said in his speech that the next few months will be 
no time for complacency no time to sit back and congratulate 
ourselves 
the president said the soviet union can build trust only when it 
stops interfering in other nations and improves its record of human 
rights 
our policy is intended to nurture what you might call more 
normal relations between east and west reagan said 
he said that a soviet union that tramples on the rights of its 
own people can never have truly normal relations with the united 
states and the rest of the free world 
neither can a soviet union that is always trying to push its 
way into other countries ever have a normal relationship with us 
taking a positive note reagan said ussoviet relations have 
taken a dramatic turn into a period of realistic engagement 
the inf treaty is now a reality and now the senate should give its 
consent to ratification 
he added that progress has been made on limiting strategic 
weapons as well 
but reagan warned that on regional issues such as afghanistan 
he wants to see deeds not just words 
they have often promised to leave a country but rarely in 
their history and then only under pressure from the west have 
they actually done it reagan said he added that the united 
states believes that the soviets still hope to prop up their 
discredited doomed puppet regime and they still seek to pose a 
threat to neighboring pakistan to whom we have a longstanding 
defense commitment 
reagan said it wasnt clear whether the soviets have planned to 
give up such ambitions but that we must make clear that any 
spreading of violence on the part of the soviets or their puppets 
could undo the good that was promised by the geneva pact 
outlining the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
the president reminded gorbachev that unless he keeps his 
promise to withdraw the red army the united states will stand by 
its hard and fast commitment to support the afghan rebels 
reagan also demanded that the soviets deal strongly with their 
allies in ethiopia and help food reach the hundreds of thousands of 
starving there 
they can stop this disaster before it happens reagan said 
appealing to the soviets to persuade the ethiopian government to 
allow the international famine relief effort to continue despite 
the ongoing civil war in that northern african nation 
as for central america reagan criticized both the soviets and 
congress for the situation in nicaragua he accused the soviets 
helped the leftist sandinistas in stealing a democratic 
revolution congress he charged had denied the freedom 
fighters the support they need to force the sandinistas to keep 
their promises of democracy 
back in washington byrd addressing the inf treaty told 
reporters 
we want a good treaty that is our objective im not 
going to rush to judgment 
he said a continuing dispute over whether the new treaty bans 
such futuristic weapons as those using laser rays or particle beam 
generators must be resolved before the treaty can be considered 
byrd said he had discussed the issue of futuristic weapons with 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee who reported verbally on the panels findings 
he said he had asked nunn to report more fully in writing 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has said in a 
letter to secretary of state george shultz that the soviets agree 
with the united states that the treaty bans futuristic weapons 
on wednesday presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
failure to ratify the treaty before the summit could tend to 
dampen prospects for progress at the summit on a longrange 
missile accord 
the white house spokesman nudged the senate to speed up the 
process as a parliamentary commission in moscow on wednesday 
approved the treaty setting the stage for soviet ratification 
before the summit 
to have the inf treaty signed before the summit would be an 
important boost to our negotiations on strategic weapons he said 
similarly if its not signed it would tend to dampen i 
think the prospects for serious progress on a strategic 
weapons treaty fitzwater added it would not be helpful and we 
would hope that the congress would be able to ratify it before we 
go 
even if the inf treaty is ratified administration officials 
doubt that a strategic arms agreement will be ready for signing at 
the summit 
the inf treaty eliminates existing missiles with a range of 300 
to 3400 miles but some senators have questioned how the pact 
would affect weapons in that range that could be developed in the 
future 
once the treaty is on the senate floor the agreement likely 
will encounter stalling tactics from sen jesse helms rnc and 
other foes

the proiranian kidnappers of lt col 
william r higgins said thursday the marine officer will be tried 
on charges of spying for the united states 
this criminal will be turned over today to the tribunal of the 
oppressed to try him for the crimes he has committed the 
organization of the oppressed on earth said in a typewritten 
statement delivered to the reuters news agency office 
higgins 43 of danville ky was serving with a un observer 
group in south lebanon when he was abducted by gunmen feb 17 near 
the ancient port of tyre 50 miles south of beirut 
the statement came three days after the christianrun voice of 
lebanon radio station claimed higgins was killed during clashes 
between prosyrian and iranianbacked shiite militias in south 
lebanon earlier this month 
it could not be known whether thursdays communique was meant to 
refute the radio report or set the stage for announcing higgins 
death 
thursdays arabiclanguage statement from the shiite moslem 
group was accompanied by a blackandwhite photograph of higgins 
apparently to prove its authenticity 
the picture showed the balding higgins with a stubbled gray 
beard wearing a dark field jacket his eyes looking down and away 
from the camera it was the first photograph of higgins released by 
his captors since his kidnapping it was not known when it was 
taken 
the statement said among the charges higgins faced was spying 
for the criminal united states on our lebanese and palestinian 
peoples and active participation in american conspiracies 
against our moslem people 
higgins supervised a pentagon team to combat lebanese and 
palestinian islamic organizations in palestine and lebanon the 
statement said 
both the united states and the united nations have previously 
denied earlier charges by the kidnappers that higgins was spying 
for the cia 
l paul bremer ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism said 
the kidnappers latest charge is of course nonsense 
col higgins is not a spy he was working for the united 
nations for a peaceful mission and we hold his hostage holders 
responsible for his safety bremer told cbs this morning 
in washington a state department spokeswoman said a socalled 
trial of higgins can bring only further discredit to the 
terrorists and their cause the notion that the organization for 
the oppressed on earth has the right to try anyone is simply 
grotesque said spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
higgins the statement alleged provided the defense department 
with his personal views on the situation in the south which 
include all military activities in resisting israel and ways of 
bringing them under control 
it claimed he was a member of what it called an american 
coordination committee on lebanon and palestine made up of 
officials from the defense department the state department and the 
central intelligence agency 
the kidnappers released a videotape feb 22 in which the vietnam 
veteran and onetime aide to former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger asked president reagan to meet demands for his release 
the kidnappers have demanded a full israeli withdrawal from an 
occupied enclave in south lebanon and the release of all lebanese 
and palestinian guerrillas held by israel 
the us administration has refused to intervene with israel 
over the captors demands and said higgins plea was made under 
duress 
thursdays statement was the fourth from the group since it 
claimed feb 19 that it had kidnapped him 
also thursday the wife of another american hostage alann 
steen sent him her good wishes for his 49th birthday in an 
advertisement published by the independent annahar daily 
steen a native of boston was a communications instructor at 
the usaffiliated beirut university college when he was kidnapped 
on jan 24 last year 
dearest alann said the published note from virginia rose 
steen 30 of jackson mich who also works at the beirut college 
we love you dearly we keep working and hoping with others that 
you will be with us again soon 
there are nine americans among the 22 foreigners held hostage in 
lebanon held the longest is american terry anderson the chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

the us military said today that 
unidentified intruders broke into an american military fuel storage 
area near the panama canal for the third time in two weeks 
bill ormsby a civilian spokesman for the us southern command 
said he did not know if sentries guarding the arraijan tank farm 
near howard air force base exchanged fire with intruders wednesday 
night 
they are still being debriefed and i dont have any details 
myself ormsby said 
however ormsby said he did not believe there were any injuries 
in the incident a marine was killed in the first reported 
intrusion on april 11 when he was shot by fellow guards 
ormsby said the 807acre tank farm about five miles west of 
panama city was being guarded by members of the 193rd light 
infantry brigade which is based in panama 
the soldiers replaced the marines after the second reported 
intrusion last week in that incident the marines said they 
engaged in a twohour firefight with what they said were between 40 
and 50 men dressed in black uniforms 
the marines involved in the first two breakins had arrived in 
panama only the week before from camp lejeune nc as part of a 
1300man us military buildup 
the panamanian government ridiculed us accounts of the alleged 
intrusions saying the marines had fired at swaying palm trees 
and shadows it later filed a diplomatic protest over the incidents 
the southern command still has not released a report of its 
investigation into last weeks incidents but a source close to the 
probe said it turned up no conclusive evidence 
the source however said small electronic sensors scattered 
over the hilly jungled reserve had detected the presence of 
intruders which tended to confirm the visual sightings reported by 
the marines 
a pentagon spokesman dan howard told reporters in washington 
early last week that the intruders appeared to be members of the 
panama defense forces 
the defense forces are commanded by gen manuel antonio noriega 
who is under criminal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges the reagan administration along with civilian 
opponents in panama has been seeking the generals ouster for 
months 
on wednesday the government revoked a monthold state of 
emergency that curbed civil liberties after rebel soldiers 
attempted to overthrow noriega 
the national assembly voted to revoke the emergency decree at 
the request of acting president manuel solis palma a local 
television broadcast said there was no immediate comment from the 
government 
the state of urgency permitted the noriegacontrolled 
government to suspend a wide range of civil liberties including 
freedom of speech and assembly and the right to private property 
the government invoked the decree on march 18 two days after 
dissident officers tried to remove noriega as head of panamas 
15000strong defense forces but failed and were captured 
a us military official said four highranking panamanian 
military officers would visit fort mcnair near washington dc 
next week highranking members of noriegas staff are seldom 
accessible to us officials 
in another development roderick esquivel ousted as vice 
president by pronoriega lawmakers along with thenpresident eric 
arturo delvalle appealed to latin american governments to support 
efforts to oust the general 
in a letter released wednesday he said 
we hope that the latin american democracies will raise their 
voice without euphemisms show solidarity and help panamanians to 
break up this dangerous dictatorship 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as the nations 
president 
in february noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking 
charges in florida he has since successfully resisted us 
economic sanctions and an opposition campaign aimed at forcing him 
out of office

joseph vignola is heavily favored to win the 
democratic nomination for us senate on tuesday if he does his 
problems have just started 
the nominee will be going against the wellknown and wellheeled 
republican incumbent john heinz iii and against tradition 
pennsylvania has not sent a democrat to the senate since joseph s 
clark won in 1962 
vignola the former philadelphia city controller is the 
bestfinanced of the four democratic candidates and has the 
endorsement of the democratic state committee 
potter county commissioner susan kefover is his only active 
opponent but she has raised barely more than 5000 vignolas 
campaign raised 133352 between january and april 
the other two candidates are john logue a professor of 
political science at villanova university and economic consultant 
steven s douglas 
logue who ran unsuccessfully for the democratic senate 
nomination in 1982 bills himself as the only democrat who can beat 
heinz he says he seeks to promote world peace to protect the 
environment and to lower the budget and trade deficits 
kefover says people have lost faith in government 
we have to start giving more control back to local government 
officials to help bring that confidence back and get us all back 
in shape she said during a recent campaign stop in lancaster 
county 
douglas 36 ran unsuccessfully in the 1986 gubernatorial 
primary and was supported by the organization of lyndon larouche 
the political extremist who had sought the presidency 
heinz whose campaign had 18 million on hand as of april 6 
compared to 48013 for vignola has no primary opposition 
a heinzvignola race would shape up as a rerun of the 1986 race 
between republican sen arlen specter and democrat bob edgar 
in both cases the democrat is a liberal from philadelphia 
making his first run for statewide office against an incumbent 
moderate republican who is better known and better financed 
specter won 57 percent of the vote against edgar 
workers in the heinz and vignola campaigns said they knew of no 
public opinion polls that had been taken before the primary 
vignolas aides acknowledged that any voter preference poll 
would likely show that their candidate is not yet widely recognized 
in the western half of the state a common problem for philadelphia 
candidates 
vignola is already campaigning against heinz with lines such 
as we need a senator to represent the people on main street in 
pennsylvania not wall street 
heinz heir to 57 varieties of money from the pittsburghbased 
pickle packing company served two terms in the house then poured 
29 million of his own money to win his senate seat in 1976 
heinz has been silent during the campaign but his aides sprang 
to his defense when vignola claimed heinz voted against a highway 
contruction bill important to pennsylvanias turnpike improvement 
program 
vignola said heinz was one of 17 senators who voted against the 
bill which ultimately was vetoed by president reagan however the 
records show heinz was not among the 17 who voted nay march 19 
1987 
heinz was absent because his plane from pittsburgh was delayed 
aides said he had a notation placed in the official record that he 
supported the bill

gores campaign soared on super tuesday on march 8 when he 
scored primary victories in arkansas kentucky north carolina 
oklahoma as well as his home state of tennessee but he was never 
able to capitalize on his southern success when the campaign turned 
to the midwestern and northern states when he got only 10 percent 
of the new york primary vote on tuesday he decided to pull the 
plug 
gore entered the race bidding to emerge as the type of moderate 
southern candidate who could permit the democratic party to capture 
southern states in the fall election 
nevada aside virtually his only campaign success came in his 
native region 
i lost this race and that is a big disappointment gore said 
as his wife tipper and other members of his family stood by his 
side 
but some things matter to me more than winning helping my 
party serving my country knowing when to keep fighting and 
knowing when ive been licked 
gore amassed 423 democratic national convention delegates during 
his campaign according to a count by the associated press his 
decision to suspend rather than formally quit the campaign means 
they can attend the convention 
had he decided to withdraw his delegates would have been 
divided between jackson and dukakis

michael dukakis the clear democratic frontrunner after beating 
jesse jackson and albert gore jr in new york said today the 
partys runnerup after the primaries wont necessarily be the vice 
presidential choice gore conceding things didnt turn out 
exactly as i planned suspended his campaign but said he would 
hang on to the delegates hes won so far 
i want no part of a stopjackson or stopdukakis movement the 
only man i want to stop is george bush and were going to stop 
george bush gore said bringing applause from supporters at a news 
conference in a senate office building 
technically i shall remain a candidate for the nomination but 
only to enable my delegates to go to the convention so they can 
represent our point of view in our partys deliberations he said 
gore the youngest candidate in the race joked that in the 
campaign i was doing great until i turned 40 
jackson in pennsylvania brushed aside surveys suggesting he 
faces an uphill fight in next weeks primary in that state i do 
not follow opinion polls i mold opinion jackson told cheering 
supporters in philadelphia 
gores decision to merely suspend his campaign followed a 
similar action by sen paul simon earlier 
both dukakis and jackson were campaigning today in pennsylvania 
where 178 democratic delegates are at stake on tuesday dukakis was 
going on to ohio which holds its primary a week later 
dukakis asked about a potential running mate during an 
interview with the associated press said i have spent literally 
zero time thinking about it and i will not unless and until i 
have either won the nomination or it looks as if its pretty well 
in hand 
some jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of jackson 
as a possible running mate if dukakis were the nominee there 
would be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket campaign chairman 
willie brown told the new york times 
but democratic national committee chairman paul kirk said such a 
ticket was unlikely kirk in comments published in todays seattle 
postintelligencer said only once in 19 elections since the 
turn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placed 
second and asked him to run it was 1960 
dukakis himself said if i were to finish second it wouldnt 
entitle me to anything more than consideration period 
he refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steer 
questions about the vice presidency away from jackson 
the nominee makes that decision as he jackson himself 
said and rightly so dukakis said 
on the republican side vice president george bush continued his 
march to the nomination with 1052 of the 1139 delegates needed 
to nominate 
bush was endorsed wednesday by california gov george 
deukmejian who had initially pledged neutrality through the june 7 
california primary but bushs only remaining competitor is pat 
robertson who has all but halted his campaign 
simons suspension of his democratic presidential campaign 
earlier this month drew fire from jackson who complained bitterly 
about the illinois senators decision to keep a lock on delegates 
that would otherwise have gone to him 
jackson campaign spokesman bob brosage brushed aside talk of 
jackson as vice president were still running for president 
he said there are significant primaries to come 
and jackson himself gave no indication hes giving up his drive 
for the nomination 
we have come a long way and we will not turn back he told 
an enthusiastic crowd of 3500 at a philadelphia rally 
jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of the 
philadelphia daily news a survey commissioned by the newspaper in 
concert with the pittsburgh postgazette suggested this week that 
dukakis had a 31 lead in the state 
even so jesse jackson can win the daily news said in an 
editorial 
financial reports filed with the federal election commission 
indicated jackson had his best fundraising month ever in march 
raising 28 million but dukakis whose campaign has been well 
bankrolled all along raised 34 million during the same period 
jacksons stops in pennsylvania today ranged from a high school 
to a labor rally to a homeless shelter dukakis was heading for 
pittsburgh tonight after spending a day in boston following the 
new york primary 
new york gov mario cuomo at a democratic dinner in washington 
wednesday night was eager to move beyond the raucous contest in 
his home state 
i expect the campaign will be converted to an intelligent 
civilized exchange of opinions he said 
dukakis is comfortably ahead of jackson in the delegate count 
getting a boost wednesday from the selection of congressional 
super delegates 
the latest associated press delegate count gives dukakis 
106315 jackson 8411 gore 42155 and uncommitted 61375 out 
of 2081 needed to nominate 
but dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk of 
inevitability when he was introduced at a statehouse reception in 
massachusetts as the next president of the united states he 
grinned but quickly cautioned steady as she goes 
in one respect however dukakis was behaving as if he were the 
nominee focusing attacks on bush who is all but certain to carry 
the gop banner in the fall 
im a doer dukakis said wednesday saying that 
characteristic stands in sharp contrast to the republican 
nominee

a convicted sheeprustler with a 
cowboys grudge against rules and regulations won a gaming license 
thursday for a tiny rural casino 
jimmy williams 57 was approved by the state gaming commission 
for a sixmonth temporary license to run two slot machines and a 
blackjack game at the golden club in the isolated town of austin in 
central nevada 
commission chairman john oreilly warned williams who inherited 
a onesixth interest in the club from his mother that he would 
have to adhere to tough gaming regulations 
oreilly told williams he would be wearing two hats one is 
your cowboy hat and one is your gaming hat he added that 
williams must follow the rules even though hes in a remote area 
commissioner bob lewis told williams his application was a 
refreshing break from the others we had to read 
williams had told the commissions investigative arm the state 
gaming control board that he had many conflicts with brand 
inspectors the bureau of land management and other regulatory 
agencies 
sometimes he said he pleaded guilty just to get out of courts 
and back to the hills 
williams said he spent 10 months in prison in 1962 for rustling 
he said he had hauled another ranchers sheep out of an area where 
they were interfering with a camp he was running and simply 
released them elsewhere 
im still looking for those sheep joked commissioner lewis 
who grew up in the same central nevada area

the capitals worst dust storm in 36 years shut 
down beijings airport for several hours thursday while pedestrians 
used surgical masks and scarves to protect themselves from the 
swirling yellow soil 
the storms began april 2 and have continued intermittently 
since sometimes limiting visibility to a few hundred yards and 
turning the beijing sky already gray from coal dust to a chalky 
yellow 
the last time beijing had such bad weather was 1952 said li 
tingfu of the beijing meteorological bureau 
high winds carrying tons of the soil called loess swirl into 
beijing every spring from the arid plateaus northwest of the 
capital 
the storms have lessened in recent years due to antierosion 
measures such as planting thousands of trees to form a green 
wall north of the city but a lack of rain in inner mongolia and 
gansu province in northwestern china aggravated the problem 
the airport has been forced to close at least twice due to poor 
visibility cars buildings and sidewalks were coated with fine 
dust which also seeped into homes and offices

sen albert gore jr said today he would 
suspend his campaign for the 1988 democratic nomination and said he 
would do everything i can to elect a democrat as the next 
president 
in a graceful exit gore said he would technically remain a 
candidate to permit his delegates to attend the democratic national 
convention 
but he said in room crowded with supporters i want no part 
of a stop jackson or a stop dukakis movement the only man i want 
to stop is george bush and were going to stop george bush 
gore exited with a joke after a failed campaign that he said 
lasted 10 months and a million miles 
i was doing great until i turned 40 the tennessee senator 
said 
gores withdrawal leaves only frontrunner michael dukakis and 
jesse jackson as active candidates for the democratic nomination 
gores campaign soared on super tuesday on march 8 when he 
scored primary victories in arkansas kentucky north carolina 
oklahoma as well as his home state of tennessee but he was never 
able to capitalize on his southern success when the campaign turned 
to the midwestern and northern states when he got only 10 percent 
of the new york primary vote on tuesday he decided to pull the 
plug 
gore entered the race bidding to emerge as the type of moderate 
southern candidate who could permit the democratic party to capture 
southern states in the fall election 
nevada aside virtually his only campaign success came in his 
native region 
i lost this race and that is a disappointment gore said as 
his wife tipper and other members of his family stood by his side 
but some things matter to me more than winning helping my 
party serving my country knowing when to keep fighting and 
knowing when ive been licked 
gore amassed 423 democratic national convention delegates during 
his campaign according to a count by the associated press his 
decision to suspend rather than formally quit the campaign means 
they can attend the convention 
had he decided to withdraw his delegates would have been 
divided between jackson and dukakis 
gore spent his final hours as an active candidate trying to 
retire his huge debt 
he went to texas on wednesday for a 1000aperson fundraiser 
to pay off some of the more than 15 million in debts the campaign 
has run up 
arriving in austin gore told reporters im in the midst now 
of consulting with friends and supporters all over the country and 
asking for their advice on how we can best continue the cause for 
which i have been fighting 
at the dinner he did not say whether he would withdraw but his 
speech had the sound of a last hurrah 
i have learned from my opponents i believe they have learned 
from me he said 
and he talked about turning attention to the general election 
these next few weeks will be a time for unity and a time to 
look forward to the fall election he said 
the tennessee senator praised both jackson and dukakis he said 
jackson has reclaimed our partys passion for social justice 
and that dukakis has shown a steady hand through a long and 
trying campaign 
they are both good men and formidable candidates he said 
gores strategy for winning the nomination was unusual and 
ultimately unsuccessful 
he skipped the opening iowa caucuses where his message as a 
raging moderate was not wellreceived 
then his campaign waffled on how much of an effort to make in 
new hampshire where his issue positions found a receptive 
audience by the time the money was poured into the granite state 
it was too late to affect the outcome and he finished fifth in a 
sevenman field 
i always felt like if anybody could pass up iowa and new 
hampshire he could said kathy vick louisiana democratic party 
chairman that he was an exception to the unwritten rule that you 
had to play in iowa and new hampshire 
gore proclaimed that he would jumpstart his campaign in his 
home region on march 8 the super tuesday when every southern and 
border state but one held primaries 
he did well that day but so did dukakis and jackson 
splintering the political benefits of the massive regional primary 
after that gore could not find a place to make a stand he 
skipped michigan and connecticut but then put a chunk of money 
into wisconsin where he once again finished behind the two 
frontrunners 
new york was his last stand

health care workers with aids are nearly twice as 
likely as other aids patients to have contracted the disease 
through undetermined means federal health officials said 
thursday 
they added however that the occupational risk to such workers 
remains small 
the national centers for disease control reported that 2586 
health care workers are known to be among the more than 50000 
americans who have contracted aids health care workers make up 54 
percent of the known us aids patients and also make up a similar 
percentage of the population at large 57 percent the cdc said 
but while only 28 percent of the nations other aids patients 
are classified as having gotten the disease in an undetermined 
manner nearly twice as many of the health care workers with aids 
fall into no known risk group 53 percent or 135 in all 
reasons for the higher number of undetermined cases among 
health care workers are unknown the atlantabased cdc said those 
reasons could include failure to disclose homosexual behavior drug 
abuse or other risk factors the occupational risk of aids 
infection as a result of blood exposure or both 
the disease most often strikes homosexual men and injectible 
drug abusers and also is spread less frequently through 
heterosexual contact or blood transfusions 
failure to disclose behavior which might have put them at risk 
is something researchers consider when looking at all aids 
patients with undetermined risk both health care workers and 
nonhealth care workers said dr mary chamberland a cdc aids 
specialist 
or we may be seeing some occupational transmission in the 
health care setting she said its difficult to establish with 
certainty how transmission occurred 
most us health care workers who have aids were infected 
outside their job but a small number of healthcare workers have 
been infected through occupational exposures the cdc noted 
in its weekly report 
more than a dozen health care workers are documented to have 
become infected with the virus that causes aids as a result of 
their work usually by accidentally being pricked by a 
contaminated needle one health care worker is known to have gone 
on to develop the deadly disease itself after he was infected in 
such a manner 
scientific studies have shown that the chance of being infected 
after a needlestick exposure to blood from infected patients is 
less than 1 percent the cdc said 
that data has not changed at all in continuing studies 
ms chamberland said the risk is still regarded as low and its 
most closely associated with inoculation with tainted blood 
either in a needlestick or in a cut with a sharp object 
the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
reported in the united states is 59491 including 33280 cases in 
which the person has died according to statistics this week from 
the cdc

the united states may have shot ourselves in 
the foot by overreacting with this weeks military attacks on 
iranian oil platforms and ships in the persian gulf rep les 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee said in 
remarks released thursday 
there is good reason to suspect that the mines that prompted 
mondays retaliation were not laid by tehran authorities but by 
some iranian radicals looking to start a fight the wisconsin 
democrat said 
aspin admitted that i cannot prove this no one at this time 
can prove who ordered the laying the of the mines or why 
aspins analysis was contained in a speech he will deliver 
friday morning to the washington forum a private group a text of 
the speech was released thursday evening 
white house spokesman bill harlow asked for comment said i 
dont usually engage in debates over speeches 
at the pentagon officials said there would be no comment until 
they had read aspins speech 
we may have shot ourselves in the foot said aspin our 
restrained policy in the gulf worked superbly until now we had 
shown sufficient force to convince iran to back off without 
reacting so bloodily as to generate the martyrs that the 
iranian radicals use to inflame public passions 
navy forces on monday destroyed two iranian oil platforms in the 
southern persian gulf after a mine believed laid by iran was struck 
by the frigate uss samuel b roberts on april 14 ten sailors were 
injured and the ship suffered hull damage 
after the platforms were destroyed iranian ships and planes 
attacked navy forces and the navy responded by sinking or damaging 
six iranian ships 
the action won wide praise and support on capitol hill both 
from republicans and democrats aspin had not commented but he 
previously been a supporter of administration gulf policy 
president reagan after the fighting said weve taken this 
action to make certain the iranians have no illusions about the 
cost of irresponsible behavior we aim to deter further iranian 
aggression not provoke it 
but aspin said more usiran confrontations may lie ahead 
the navy has been escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers and 
navy ships had previously destroyed iranian oil platforms last oct 
19 in retaliation for iranian minelaying efforts 
those strikes came after an iranian ship the iran ajar was 
caught by the navy while laying mines defense secretary frank 
carlucci said monday that mines in the area where the roberts was 
damaged were from the same series of those found on the iran 
ajar leaving no doubt the mines were sown by iran 
aspin asserted that the regime of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
reevaluated its persian gulf policy in january and decided not 
to confront the united states any more 
there is good reason to suspect that some irate iranian 
radicals decided to light a fire in the persian gulf he said 
it would not take more than a handful of revolutionary guards 
to drop some mines in the gulf sea lanes he said they could 
expect that if an american ship hit one the united states would 
retaliate and they could return to the glorious confrontational 
days of yore 
if this theory is correct the radicals have won aspin 
said with this weeks shootup in the gulf the regimes policy 
of declaring victory and then turning its back on the gulf has 
failed it cannot ignore the american presence now

israel and the united states signed an 
agreement on mutual cooperation thursday formalizing ties 
established during the reagan administration 
the memorandum was signed simultaneously in washington and 
jerusalem by president reagan and prime minister yitzhak shamir 
describing the reagan administration as the friendliest israel 
has ever known shamir said the fiveyear agreement formalized ad 
hoc arrangements developed in the past few years 
the memorandum formalizes the two nations consultative groups 
which meet periodically to discuss joint military and security 
assistance as well as economic development issues 
us ambassador thomas pickering who attended the signing 
ceremony in jerusalem hinted at disagreements between shamir and 
the us government over current american peace efforts 
peace is as vital for israels security as military and 
economic strength and we will continue to work with all the states 
in this region to achieve that objective he said 
shamir opposes a us initiative to convene an international 
peace conference and speed up negotiations leading to palestinian 
selfrule and later a permanent peace settlement 
relations between israel and the united states drew close after 
the 1967 middle east war when washington became israels major 
supplier of arms after other western armsproducing countries 
refused to sell weapons to the jewish state 
in 1973 the united states airlifted weapons and ammunition to a 
beleaguered israel caught off guard when egypt and syria lauched a 
surprise attack 
under the reagan administration civilian and military aid to 
israel has grown to 3 billion and ties have grown closer 
in 1981 the two countries signed a secret agreement on 
strategic cooperation which included provisions for military trade 
and joint planning 
in 1985 an economic accord was signed lifting trade barriers 
between the two countries 
in recent years israel has become a port of call for ships of 
the us mediterranean fleet and has provided the united states 
with land for a transmitter to beam voice of america and radio free 
europe broadcasts to the soviet union

former presidential spokesman larry speakes 
said thursday his speaking out is no kiss and tell book as 
ronald reagan has called it 
such a book would have a little more juicytype items in it 
that are a little bit more punchy speakes said thursday on the 
nbctv today show 
speakes said the controversy over the quotes he fabricated as 
the presidents was a total surprise 
a lot of people have told me thats done all the time in 
washington that you supply a few quotes he said 
speakes said in the book that a comment he provided as having 
been made by reagan to mikhail gorbachev while they were in geneva 
at a summit meeting was never said and another quote he gave as 
reagans actually was said by secretary of state george shultz 
i did it on the spur of the moment i did it in order to serve 
the president i did it as an act of loyalty to the president 
certainly not as an act of disloyalty to the president speakes 
said 
the furor led to speakes resignation last week as chief 
spokesman for merrill lynch amp co in new york a job he took after 
six years at the white house 
speakes said he did not know whether the sin was in the doing or 
in the telling about it its hard for me to decide what im 
being critized for he said

president pw botha said 
thursday he would push for black participation in cabinetlevel 
policymaking and on the electoral college that selects the 
president 
botha aides called the proposals outlined in a speech to 
parliament a major reform initiative but they fell far short of 
black demands for full voting rights and abolition of apartheid 
legislation 
the increasingly powerful farright conservative party which 
opposes any concessions to blacks assailed the speech the 
conservatives koos van der merwe urged botha to resign and said 
the presidents colossal lack of political credibility had made 
him an object of ridicule among his fellow afrikaners 
bothas proposals appeared unlikely to ease international 
pressure on south africa for an end to apartheid which establishes 
racially segregated neighborhoods hospitals and schools gives the 
5 million whites almost total political control and deprives the 26 
million blacks of a vote in national affairs 
but domestically bothas message was that his national party 
would not back off from slowpaced reform despite the 
conservatives victories in three recent parliamentary byelections 
if the white people do not wish to follow my way it is their 
responsibility botha said if they follow the way of 
confrontation it is their problem 
bothas proposal to include blacks in the electoral college 
would if implemented mark the first time that blacks had a direct 
voice in the selection of south africas president he gave no 
details about how many seats blacks might have in the college 
which has 88 members 50 of them from the national party 
botha suggested that a cabinetlevel executive authority be 
opened to people not serving in parliament this would clear the 
way for participation in policymaking by blacks who are excluded 
from parliament 
botha also reiterated his longstanding proposal for creation of 
a national advisory council on which he and top cabinet ministers 
would negotiate with black leaders on drafting of a new 
constitution that would bring blacks into the central government 
we are not committed to the name the form the composition or 
the functions of such a body he said we are committed to the 
concept of a forum for deliberation 
he said black leaders were unhappy with the term national 
council and suggested that their reluctance might be overcome by 
calling the forum the great indaba indaba is a zulu word for a 
tribal assembly 
most prominent black leaders have rejected overtures to 
participate in the council saying the government first must free 
imprisoned black nationalist leaders such as nelson mandela and 
lift restrictions on major antiapartheid organizations 
mangosuthu buthelezi chief minister of the kwazulu homeland and 
a leading black moderate said bothas electoral college proposal 
amounted to tokenism because the national party does not 
admit to the existence of a black majority in south africa 
but buthelezi praised botha for finding the courage to confront 
the far right 
now that he has taken a first tentative step to defy the 
conservative party let him be bold and be explicit about how 
far he is prepared to go 
helen suzman veteran parliament member for the liberal 
progressive federal party criticized botha for not setting a 
timetable for his proposals she said he was evading the question 
of black participation in parliament 
botha became prime minister in 1978 that postition was 
abolished in 1984 with the adoption of a new consititution and he 
was installed as president 
in his speech botha proposed that the office of prime minister 
be revived to handle daytoday government affairs while the 
president concentrates on major policy matters and ceremonial 
duties 
botha said political progress in south africa would be impeded 
by continued pressure from the international brotherhood of 
persecutors 
he stressed that white south africans values and principles 
may under no circumstances be compromised 
should they collapse then south africa will collapse he 
said 
he chided antiapartheid clergymen such as anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu for their increasingly vocal opposition to the 
government and their calls for punitive sanctions 
he said they play into the hands of the outlawed african 
national congress the major guerrilla movement fighting the 
government 
the president said only a small fraction of south africas 
christians supported the antiapartheid stance of tutu and his 
colleagues

a japaneseamerican living in japan said thursday 
he expects to receive an apology for being interned in the united 
states during world war ii but not to get reparations as approved 
by the us senate 
barry saiki 68 a retired us army officer working in public 
relations in japan said reparations were justified because 
japaneseamericans lost possessions and five years of their lives 
i think well get the apology saiki said in a telephone 
interview but he said he thought president reagan would veto the 
bill that eventually emerges from congress 
the chance that congress would overturn a presidential veto was 
slim he said therefore the possiblity of getting the reparation 
is rather questionable 
the senate passed a bill wednesday to give an apology and 
20000 in taxfree payments to japaneseamericans who were rounded 
up and placed in camps after the japanese attack on pearl harbor on 
dec 7 1941 the house passed a similar bill in september 
the japanese government had no official reaction to the senate 
action because it was a domestic us issue foreign ministry 
spokesman yoshifumi matsuda told reporters 
but matsuda said he personally praised the senate action because 
he had been a consul general at the japanese consulate in los 
angeles and had worked on the issue 
after many years the justness and fairness are recovered 
through democracy matsuda said this is the way of american 
democracy 
saiki said he and his family were uprooted from their california 
home in 1942 like thousands of other japaneseamericans who fell 
under suspicion after the attack on pearl harbor 
he had been about to graduate from the university of california 
at berkeley but instead ended up in a camp in arkansas with his 
mother and two younger brothers his father was sent to a separate 
camp for community leaders he said 
saiki was inducted into the us army in 1944 and was 
commissioned as an officer just as the war ended his family was 
able to move to philadelphia where they worked as farm laborers 
living in the basement of an old house 
after the war his family returned to california again working 
as farm laborers 
from the day they were evacuated in 1942 in 1947 five years 
later they hadnt gotten back to prewar status saiki said 
they had lost everything they had acquired up to 1942 i very 
definitely feel it reparations is very justified 
he said his own military career in counterintelligence brought 
him to japan on four tours after the war and he spent 10 years on 
military duty in this country then after he retired as a 
lieutenant colonel in 1966 he returned here to work and has 
remained ever since 
saiki is a member of the board of the japaneseamerican 
citizens league which has about 150 members 
some of us are not in such pressing need for money he said 
but there are others who are half the people have died and 
every year the number is getting smaller the people who deserved 
the money and who need it are gradually dying 
asked if he felt japan had a role in the issue because its 
attack on pearl harbor led to the internment he replied its an 
american problem its not because of japan that it happened

a recent surge in the number of 
immigration amnesty applicants shows that the program is working 
and the may 4 deadline need not be extended the immigration 
services no 2 official said thursday 
we have had a rush of applications toward the end of the 
program so were sure people are aware of the deadline said 
mark everson immigration and naturalization service deputy 
commissioner theyve had 1 years to collect their documentation 
and come forward 
everson speaking at an immigration law conference sponsored by 
three law schools said a proposal to extend the amnesty 
application deadline six months will have a harder time passing the 
senate than the house where it passed wednesday by 12 votes he 
said the justice department will urge president reagan to veto the 
measure if both houses approve it 
it will send a bad signal to extend it everson told about 
150 ins officials immigration lawyers scholars and clergy 
involved in helping aliens file their applications people 
waiting in other countries will interpret it as a lack of resolve 
and theyll eventually come here with the thought that well 
theyll take care of me someday too 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 people who 
have been in the country illegally since before 1982 can apply for 
amnesty from deportation and obtain temporary residency eighteen 
months later amnesty recipients may apply for permanent residency 
eventually they can apply for citizenship 
everson said the imposition of employer sanctions has cut down 
on the number of undocumented immigrants so far 70 employers of 
undocumented aliens nationwide have been fined a total of 250000 
he said 
the twoday conference is sponsored by the texas tech law 
school the university of new mexico school of law and arizona 
state university college of law 
sen alan k simpson rwyo chief senate author of the 1986 
law opposes the extention 
our numbers are right on target with the projections we used 
when we passed the bill i do not honestly see a need or 
justification for extending the signup period he said wednesday 
but during house debate the chief sponsor of the extension 
rep romano l mazzoli dky said 12 million aliens have applied 
for amnesty and 729000 have received temporary residency cards 
ins had hoped 2 million of the estimated 3 million total illegal 
aliens in the country would apply for amnesty by the deadline

serious outbreaks of diarrhea 
aboard cruise ships have become rare but the most frequent known 
culprit is a common delicacy seafood cocktail according to a 
centers for disease control suvey 
of 45 outbreaks investigated from 1975 to 1985 the most 
frequently detected source was the seafood cocktails or salad 
according to a study by the cdc presented at a conference wednesday 
in atlanta 
twothirds of all cruises during those years docked in florida 
ports 
its a real popular food on cruises and seafood is one food 
which can be contaminated if its not handled properly said 
david addiss medical epidemiologist and author of the report 
water was the second most common source of the outbreaks during 
that 10yearperiod but addiss noted that structural changes in 
the ships water systems have all but eliminated that problem 
in 25 of the 45 cases the cause could not be identified 
ship captains must radio to shore a day before they arrive at a 
us port and report the number of passengers complaining of 
diarrhea it is labeled an outbreak if more than 3 percent of the 
passengers are affected

the reagan administration opposes a proposed 
25 billion child care bill but may endorse other ways of helping 
families with preschool children education secretary william j 
bennett said thursday 
bennett said that while the administration doesnt like the act 
for better child care abc another bill giving a child care tax 
credit to any taxpayer with preschoolers whether they are cared 
for at home or elsewhere meets a series of principles he outlined 
in testimony to the house education and labor subcommittee on human 
resources 
it is not yet clear whether the administration will propose its 
own tax credit or support other federal initiatives to make day 
care more affordable or available bennett said current tax law 
allows a credit for children cared for outside the home 
its a matter of debate and discussion within the 
administration right now bennett said 
the abc bill is backed by the democratic leadership in congress 
and scores of organizations representing children women labor 
churches and medical personnel it is sponsored by rep dale 
kildee dmich and sen christopher dodd dconn 
threequarters of the 25 billion in abc money would help pay 
the child care bills in families making up to 115 percent of a 
states median income the rest would go for training and salaries 
for child care workers renovation of facilities and referral 
programs for parents a national advisory panel would develop 
minimum federal child care standards 
conservatives including phyllis schlafly complained thursday 
that the abc bill is too expensive and cumbersome promotes 
institutional care and discriminates against parents who stay at 
home with their children and they said the income cutoff in the 
bill would let some families earning 40000 get financial help 
another controversy centers on whether religious groups that 
provide child care would be eligible for abc grants kildee said he 
is working for changes to make sure they qualify for money but the 
american civil liberties union said the bill as it stands violates 
the wall between church and state 
this is one big new federal trough for churches said barry 
lynn legislative counsel to the aclu too many of them want it 
and theyre not willing to recognize the serious constitutional 
issues here 
another tax credit bill introduced by rep clyde holloway 
rla appears to meet the objections of both conservatives and 
civil libertarians it simply would give all families a credit of 
150 to 400 per preschool child it offers more assistance and 
more choice to more families with less cost to the government 
holloway told the subcommittee 
bennett said he personally favors the holloway approach even 
though some families might use the money for purposes other than 
child care 
he said the tax credit meets the administration criteria of 
strengthening the family treating stayathome mothers fairly not 
promoting any particular type of care targeting funds to those 
most in need and helping people without setting up a new 
bureauracracy 
reflecting statements submitted for the record by labor 
secretary ann mclaughlin and assistant health and human services 
secretary sydney j olson bennett said the federal government 
should not regulate day care centers although i certainly see 
the need for some kind of standards so the public and individual 
families can have some security 
the us chamber of commerce and the national association of 
manufacturers have endorsed the gist of a middleground proposal 
sponsored by sen orrin hatch rutah and rep nancy johnson 
rconn 
their child care services improvement act would give states 250 
million in grant money for day care expansion and scholarships and 
100 million to start risk pools to limit liability another 25 
million would be available to help home providers meet state 
licensing requirements

president reagan told what he conceded 
was a very cynical joke thursday as part of his response to a 
question about the middle east at a world affairs forum here 
after pledging efforts to secure talks between israel and its 
arab neighbors reagan said 
i cant resist telling you a little joke its kind of cynical 
very cynical in a matter of fact about the middle east 
in the joke a scorpion comes to a creek and asks a frog to 
carry him across it because scorpions cant swim 
the frog says why youd sting me if i did 
the scorpion responds thatd be silly because if i stung you 
and you died id drown 
well that made sense to the frog so he said get on and 
started ferry him across and in midstream the scoprion stung him 
the president said 
as both were dying the frog asked the scorpion why did you 
do that now were both going to die 
and the scorpion said this is the middle east the 
president concluded 
the joke was greeted with laughter and applause by members of 
the world affairs council of western massachusetts 
in answering a question about the middle east reagan said that 
we are going to keep on trying as hard as we can to bring about 
talks between the arab states and israel 
when asked whether the united states was willing to talk with 
the palestinians reagan said yes he added that the united 
states refused on principle to deal with palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat because he does not recognize 
israels right to exist 
what we are seeking is palestinian leaders who will agree to 
come together with the other arab states reagan said

the federal government ran up a 291 billion 
budget deficit in march but the amount of red ink in the first six 
months of the fiscal year was 35 percent less than the same period 
last year the treasury department said thursday 
the deficit last month topped a 239 billion shortfall in 
february and a rare 161 billion surplus in january which 
occurred because social security checks that month were mailed 
early and were counted as part of decembers spending 
analysts note that the budget imbalance is usually higher in 
march than in other months because because people who owe taxes for 
1987 generally wait until april to pay while those due a refund 
normally file early 
for the first half of the 1988 fiscal year the government has 
run a deficit of 1189 billion 35 percent lower than the red ink 
incurred for the same period a year ago 
for the entire fiscal year which ends sept 30 the reagan 
administration is projecting a deficit of 1467 billion down 24 
percent from the 1504 billion deficit in 1987 
however others use less optimistic projections the 
congressional budget office estimates the deficit will climb to 
157 billion 
last year the deficit fell sharply because of an unexpected 28 
billion windfall in tax payments made by people who sold off 
longterm assets before the capital gains rates were increased 
under the new tax law 
some analysts say there could be a second smaller windfall this 
year if people end up owing more in taxes for 1987 than they would 
have under the old tax law that however will not be known until 
the government issues its budget report for april next month 
in march government revenue totaled 650 billion while 
spending totaled 941 billion for the first half of the year 
revenues total 4120 billion while spending amounted to 5309 
billion 
as usual the largest spending categories in march were the 
military followed by social security other programs in the 
department of health and human services and interest on the 
national debt 
military spending totaled 258 billion last month and 1423 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 56 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 184 billion last month 
and 1050 billion for the past six months up 56 percent from the 
same period in the 1987 fiscal year social security is exempted 
from budget limitations under the grammrudman law and is thus 
generally showing faster spending increases than the other 
categories 
the other hhs programs including medicare and medicaid spent 
142 billion in march and 775 billion so far this budget year a 
59 percent increase over 1987 
interest on the 25 trillion national debt totaled 144 
billion last month and 1052 billion so far this fiscal year an 
increase of 96 percent over the same period last year

heart surgeon michael debakey along with 
actors helen hayes and tony randall spoke out on thursday for 
continued use of animals in medical research arguing that animals 
will play a major role in the search for a cure for aids and heart 
disease 
debakey who was first to perform a successful coronary bypass 
and the first to successfully use a partial artificial heart 
recalled that when he was in medical school more than 30 years ago 
not a single cardiovascular disease could be treated 
effectively 
now we have patients who are living reasonably normal lives 
for 20 or 25 years after surgery debakey said the only means 
by which we can do these things is in working in labs with 
animals 
debakey and the others said they chose this week to state their 
case to counter laboratory animal liberation week protests by 
animal rights activists who oppose all use of animals in medical 
research barring that some are pushing for stricter controls on 
the care and feeding of laboratory animals 
thomas e starzl a transplant surgeon at the university of 
pittsburgh said he like the animal rights activists abhors 
cruelty to animals and said any incidents of poor treatment of 
research animals are the exceptions rather than the rule 
randall began the news conference by saying he has worked with 
the myasthenia gravis foundation for about 20 years although great 
strides have been made in treating the disease a cure still has 
not been found he said 
both he and hayes who began raising funds for jonas salks work 
on a polio vaccine after her daughter died of polio argued that 
animals are necessary to medical research 
if a cure is to be found for aids and heart disease i see no 
alternative hayes said 
janna koch whose 7yearold daughter was born with a congenital 
heart condition said she was lucky i didnt lose my daughter 
through animal research doctors were able to develop a pacemaker 
for her 
mrs koch who is president of the florida chapter of a group 
called incurably ill for animal research said medical research has 
found cures for many diseases 
we no longer have to live with diseases like polio she 
said thats when animal research is taken for granted

the full supreme court will consider a bail 
request from two former state senators sentenced to prison for 
their role in the wedtech scandal 
justice thurgood marshall on wednesday declined to act by 
himself on a request by michael and clarence mitchell for bail 
pending their appeals 
toni house a supreme court spokeswoman said she did not know 
if the justices would take up the motion at their regular session 
friday 
chief justice william h rehnquist had denied the bail request 
monday so clarence mitchell had to report tuesday to the 
lewisburg pa federal prison to begin his 4year sentence 
but lawyers for the brothers then submitted a new motion to 
marshall 
referring the question to the full court is a routine in such 
cases having the full court decide prevents petitioners from going 
from one justice to another seeking a favorable decision 
the mitchell brothers were convicted of fraud and obstruction of 
justice for accepting 50000 to block a congressional 
investigation of wedtech corp the now defunct new york citybased 
defense contractor which won multimilliondollar contracts by 
claiming it was substantially owned by minorities 
the investigation was led by their uncle thenrep parren j 
mitchell dmd chairman of the house small business committee he 
was never implicated in any wrongdoing 
the brothers contend they have been denied bail because they are 
black while white defendants have been allowed to remain free 
they had appealed the bail issue from the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals 
michael b mitchell also a former state senator from baltimore 
is to begin his sentence may 19 also at lewisburg

the united states began its military operation 
in the persian gulf last monday with the specific goal of sinking a 
particular iranian frigate that was known for its vicious attacks 
on merchant ships the pentagon said thursday 
ironically that goal was abandoned at one point during the 
fighting because another iranian ship had been sunk the frigate 
that had been targeted however ultimately came under attack after 
firing on us forces only to be spared from sinking by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci 
those and other details of the most extensive military clash 
ever between iran and the united states were released thursday by 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman 
beyond discussing the original attack plans howard disclosed 
president reagan had been asked to make only one command decision 
during the course of the actual fighting giving an ok for us 
jets to bomb some small iranian gunboats that had been spotted 
attacking ships and rigs in an oil field 
us forces sank or seriously damaged two iranian naval frigates 
and four smaller gunboats and fired on two iranian jets monday in 
fighting that erupted after the united states destroyed two iranian 
offshore oil platforms 
reagan ordered the destruction of the platforms in retaliation 
for the mining on april 14 of the frigate uss samuel b roberts 
ten sailors were injured in that incident 
howard and carlucci in previous briefings had disclosed the 
navy originally planned to hit three platforms instead of two one 
target was dropped they said when fighting erupted elsewhere in 
the gulf 
howard acknowledged on thursday that the united states also had 
included among its original targets an iranian warship and that was 
why three navy ships were steaming near the strait of hormuz when 
the attacks began 
the ship selected for sinking was the sabalan a frigate that 
has earned the special enmity of all merchant seamen in the gulf 
because it makes a point of shooting at the crew quarters on 
tankers it attacks 
howard agreed thursday the decision to include an iranian ship 
as a target was a first but denied the united states was changing 
its policies or immersing itself directly in the iraniraq war 
the united states he said had given assurances to iran that 
we considered their mining of international waterways to be a 
hostile act and if any us flag vessels were damaged by those 
iranian mines that we would certainly respond 
now we decided that as part of that response we were going 
to sink an iranian naval vessel he continued 
the sabalan was a target of availability we knew where it 
was that was the first criteria the fact that this ship had 
perpetrated any number of vicious attacks on merchant vessels in 
the gulf certainly did nothing to lessen our desire to use it as a 
target of availability 
according to howard the attacks on the platforms were scheduled 
to occur first and when they did the iranians apparently warned 
the sabalan by radio it ran at high speed for the naval port at 
bandar abbas where the iranian frigate anchored between two 
tankers making it impossible for us ships to fire harpoon 
missiles at it he continued 
shortly after one of the platforms was attacked an iranian 
missile boat the joshan attacked the cruiser uss wainwright and 
was in turn sunk 
at that point we were prepared to terminate the operation 
howard said the conclusion was that we had accomplished our 
goal 
the iranians however were not ready to stop another of their 
frigates the sahand came charging out of bandar abbas and fired 
on the us ships and jets overhead howard said 
it promptly was attacked and hit repeatedly and is believed to 
have sunk it was at this point the sabalan steamed back out into 
the gulf and like the sahand opened fire on american ships and 
aircraft 
a navy a6 intruder attack jet was ordered to use a laserguided 
bomb against the sabalan and hit the ship perfectly causing 
extensive damage at this point howard said the pilots asked 
permission to finish off the ship and that request was relayed 
back to washington 
carlucci and adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff discussed the matter briefly in the pentagon war 
room where they had been monitoring the action howard said 
carlucci concluded the ship should be spared further attack in 
hopes iran would end the fighting the order was passed and no 
further fighting ensued the spokesman said

tennis star ivan lendl on thursday won a major 
battle in his fight to play for the us olympic team this summer 
when a skeptical house subcommittee voted to give the czech native 
immediate us citizenship 
the measure which even proponents had given little chance of 
passage earlier this year was approved without opposition and sent 
to the house judiciary committee 
subcommittee approval likely will lead to easy passage by the 
full house said rep bruce a morrison dconn a member of the 
panel and chief sponsor of the bill 
but the legslation still would face serious obstacles in the 
senate where sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the 
senate judiciary immigration subcommittee is wary of olympic 
exemptions 
the subcommittee voted to speed up the citizenship of lendl and 
two lesserknown olympic hopefuls by removing the fiveyear waiting 
period permanent residents are required to go through 
rep romano l mazzoli dky the panels chairman who 
regularly opposes olympic bills said he was sympathetic to 
arguments that preventing lendl from participating in the olympics 
would be a true hardship because an athletes prime years are 
limited 
mazzoli said however that he was concerned by the testimony of 
us olympic committee officials who said citizenship would not 
automatically make lendl eligible for the us team 
were in kind of a catch22 in a way that we have to take 
action without actual assurance that these people would compete 
despite their worldclass caliber mazzoli said 
mazzolis consideration of the lendl measure reflects a change 
of attitude on olympic citizenship bills 
last year mazzoli outlined a new rule of his judiciary 
subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law that 
viewed private immigration bills as an extraordinary remedy 
available only to assist aliens with unusual problems and where 
extreme hardship can be demonstrated it noted that the panel 
would be extremely reluctant to consider bills for olympic 
athletes 
but lendl supporters led by morrison redoubled their efforts 
this year when house speaker jim wright dtexas pushed through a 
special citizenship bill for a 21yearold canadianborn swimmer 
living in texas 
mazzoli said one of his concerns has been that the few athletes 
who won citizenship from congress in past years have been 
unsuccessful in the international games 
the one ski guy is still completing the course mazzoli said 
but this year for the first time the subcommittee called in 
us olympic committee officials who vouched for the quality of 
lendl along with jenspeter burntd an east german swimmer who 
defected in 1985 and is living in alabama and gagik barseghian an 
armenian wrestler who moved to california in 1986 
the olympics which will be held sept 17oct 2 in seoul will 
include tennis as full sport for the first time since 1924 it was 
a trial sport in 1984 
modified olympic rules will allow professional tennis players 
such as lendl the worlds no 1 ranked player to compete 
but ronald t rowan general counsel of the us olympic 
committee said under international tennis federation rules a 
player first must represent his country in the davis cup before the 
olympics 
federation rules also say lendl needs a special waiver to play 
for the united states in the davis cup since he previously has 
represented his native czechoslovakia in those games the next 
davis cup is in july 
they need the citizenship to argue on behalf of the waivers 
and we create the citizenship without the knowledge that these 
people will ever compete mazzoli said 
morrison rejected criticism that lawmakers are favoring athletes 
such as lendl pointing to dozens of other special immigration 
bills approved for nonathletes 
we are put in the position of looking like we are taking care 
of a few famous people when what were trying to do is balance one 
arbitrary rule against another arbitrary rule he said 
lendl 28 moved to connecticut in 1981 and received his 
permanent resident status last year immigration law requires a 
fiveyear waiting period before a permanent resident can become a 
citizen

congress on thursday was urged to ban most 
random drug testing of private employees and job applicants to 
protect them against cheap and wildly inaccurate urine tests 
used by a growing number of businesses 
there are too many workers who are being subjected to bad 
tests improper procedures and a profound lack of legal protection 
in the workplace rep charles e schumer dny told a house 
hearing 
companies that conduct tests recklessly and without proper 
guidelines can ruin the lives of their employees and hinder 
legitimate efforts to prevent drug abuse schumer said an 
incorrect drug test with no chance for appeal can swiftly destroy a 
career and a family 
members of the house education and labor subcommittee on 
employment opportunities generally supported a bill sponsored 
chiefly by schumer that would ban private random drug testing 
except for probable cause and for workers in health or safety 
occupations 
schumers bill would require a followup test using a highly 
sophisticated method if an initial urine test shows positive for 
drug use the measure also would give employees broad access to 
their drug test records 
schumer said most urine tests are cheap and wildly 
inaccurate and that more sophisticated tests are accurate but 
expensive 
under questioning by rep matthew g martinez dcalif schumer 
said he would welcome a provision calling for automatic 
rehabilitation instead of a firing for any employee who tests 
positive for drug use 
l nye stevens of the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress confirmed schumers estimate that 49 
percent of the fortune 500 list of largest us businesses now 
administer drug tests to employees and said the number is 
increasing 
a recent gao survey indicates that a minority of businesses do 
not provide followup tests to employees or job applicants who 
initially test positive and do not tell applicants they were not 
hired because of a positive test stevens said 
the gao official also reported that 13 of the 34 states surveyed 
do not regulate drug test laboratories and that some laboratories 
in about onethird of the 34 states are unregulated either by 
federal or state governments 
it is my opinion that random drug testing is a waste of time 
and money is counterproductive and can create a false sense of 
security testified dr arthur j mcbay chief toxicologist for 
the north carolina state medical examiners office 
washington lawyer david soley said there are virtually no legal 
safeguards against drug testing abuses for private employees except 
under terms of their labor contracts 
soley accompanied juanita jones a school bus attendant in the 
district of columbia who was fired after her random drug test 
showed falsely that she had used marijuana she testified that it 
took a twoyear battle in local courts to clear her name and get 
her job back

developer donald trump who showed city 
officials how to get things done by fixing a central park skating 
rink faster than they could say fill this out in triplicate 
now wants to try his hand at patching up the williamsburg bridge 
trump toured the crumbling bridge thursday calling repair work 
done so far scary and pronouncing himself the one to get it 
fixed 
savoring again his 1986 triumph of rebuilding the rink after the 
city and its bureaucrats tried and failed for years trump said the 
multimilliondollar problem of the bridge stirs his imagination 
he denied that he also may be stirred by another chance to show 
up mayor edward i koch with whom he has been trading insults for 
two years 
the 85yearold bridge was closed last week when cracked and 
corroded beams were found the bridge one of three spanning the 
east river between brooklyn and manhattan carried 240000 daily 
commuters who drove or took the subway over the bridge 
officials expect that temporary repairs to the span will allow 
it to reopen in a matter of weeks but the question of whether to 
then begin a total overhaul for 250 million or replace the bridge 
entirely for even more money is undecided 
officially trump was at the bridge for a looksee at the 
invitation of alfred dellibovi a former republican state 
legislator from queens who now runs the federal urban mass 
transportation administration 
the democratic mayor said dellibovi was welcome to show the 
bridge to whomever he wished but koch commenting at a housing 
rally said he has asked trump to put up moderately priced housing 
in the city not just luxury buildings 
after hes done that then we can talk about other things but 
not before said koch 
dellibovi told reporters that he had asked trump for help 
because he feared that city bureaucratic inaction would turn 
restoration of the bridge into a four or fiveyear job 
but trump said hed had his eye on the bridge before dellibovi 
wrote to him last week 
ive already been here a number of times over the last number 
of days and weeks said trump this is one of the things id be 
willing to do for the administrator dellibovi for the city if 
they like i would be willing to step up and get this bridge open 
quickly 
commenting on the estimate of 250 million to put the bridge 
right trump told reporters i would hope to be able to do it for 
less 
the figure is probably realistic depending on what has to be 
done he said 
an easy solution is to spend a lot of money but if you can 
spend a little money and get the same result or a better result 
thats what id be here for 
trump said the deal could work the same way as the skating rink 
construction in 1986 he would advance the money get the job done 
and be reimbursed for costs that repair project took five months 
and about 3 million after the city had spent 12 million over 
seven years and still didnt have a working rink 
i wouldnt want to make a profit he said this is 
something i want to do 
during his tour of the bridge trump pointed to holes and ragged 
edges on newly painted ibeams and said now thats the most 
scary thing when they fix it but its not fixed 
youre looking at beams where the rust is painted over but 
theres nothing under there its all rotted out 
city transportation commissioner ross sandler who accompanied 
trump and dellibovi reponded in some cases the repairs will 
come after the painting no ones suggesting paint take the place 
of lost steel

american troops guarding us facilities in 
panama detected two groups of intruders his week and in one case 
drew gunfire the pentagon said thursday 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said the 
latest incidents occurred on tuesday and wednesday nights near 
bases on the pacific ocean end of the panama canal 
they followed two other incidents last week in which one marine 
was killed accidentally and a group of marines fired on what they 
described as a group of 40 to 50 armed intruders 
the incident tuesday the more serious of the two this week 
occurred around midnight near an ammunition storage depot next to 
the us naval stationpanama howard said an army sentry 
stationed there spotted three men who had crossed inside the 
perimeter of the site he said 
the guards report indicated that the intruders wore berets 
and carried small arms and bags an intruder fired shots at the 
us guard the guard returned the fire remained at the sentry 
post and requested assistance 
the intruder then fired again a marine quickreaction force 
of 12 men was sent to reinforce and assist in the search of the 
area a security sweep of the area was completed during darkness 
with negative results but the investigation continues there were 
no casualties during the incident howard added 
the second incident occurred around 8 pm wednesday when three 
us sentries manning an observation post to the west of howard air 
force base detected roughly 30 intruders approaching the base the 
spokesman said 
the soldiers fired on the intruders and they also fired two 
claymore mines as a diversion he continued 
howard said those intruders then retreated apparently without 
firing any shots at the sentries 
the spokesman disclosed the latest incidents in acknowledging 
the pentagon had been unable to establish conclusively that armed 
intruders fired on marines during one of last weeks incidents 
military investigators spent several days combing the jungle 
area where about 100 marines fired at what they believed to be 40 
to 50 armed intruders near a fuel tank facility 
its true that there were no expended cartridge casings 
found howard said 
investigators did turn up however a couple of bottles of 
insect repellent not used by us forces a used firstaid bandage 
a blackcolored kerchief and also the sweep there revealed several 
wellestablished trails around the perimeter marked with slash 
marks he said 
there is other evidence as well there were also some sensors 
set off in the area but is it conclusive i dont believe it is 
no final evaluation has been done on this at this point 
the marines have been ridiculed by panamanian military strongman 
manuel antonio noriega who accused them of firing at swaying 
palm trees 
about 1900 additional us troops have been ordered to panama 
in the last several weeks to provide increased protection for 
american bases and facilities near the panama canal

plo chief yasser arafat will not visit 
syria soon despite speculation the burial of his murdered deputy in 
damascus would signal a rapprochement with president hafez assad a 
plo official said thursday 
george habash leader of the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine said arafat abandoned plans to attend 
khalil wazirs funeral on wednesday because there were no 
guarantees of an official welcome or an audience with assad 
wazir 52 better known by his nom de guerre of abu jihad was 
gunned down by a commando unit that burst into his home in the 
tunisian capital of tunis on saturday 
the palestine liberation organization and the tunisians blamed 
israel for the slaying of wazir the plos coordinator for unrest 
in israelioccupied territories miltary sources in israel also 
confirmed israeli involvement 
at the united nations on thursday israel boycotted a security 
council meeting at which nations attacked it for wazirs 
assassination 
tunisian foriegn minister mahmoud mestiri asked the council to 
condemn israel for terrorist aggression against his nation in 
wazirs slaying 
wazir was buried wednesday in the yarmouk refugee camp outside 
damascus as hundreds of thousands mourned 
his slaying and the key role he played in the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza strip 
spawned new efforts to end the 5yearold rift between the plo and 
syria 
long considered a pragmatic moderate within the plo wazir was 
widely respected even by arafats opponents in dissident 
palestinian factions 
arafat was expelled from damascus in 1983 at the peak of a 
syriansponsored mutiny in plo ranks but the syrian government had 
said all plo officials including arafat were welcome to take part 
in wazirs funeral 
speaking in an interview at his headquarters in damascus habash 
said arafat should have come for the funeral 
if i were in his shoes i wouldnt have missed this 
opportunity he said 
the plo dissidents have been based in damascus but the key 
groups such as habashs group and the moscowbacked democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine reconciled with arafat in 
algiers last year 
assad moscows main arab ally has been under pressure from the 
soviets to reconcile with arafat to forge a united arab front for 
an international middle east peace conference it seeks to convene 
intensive contacts have been made in damascus between syrian 
officials and plo leaders since they arrived tuesday for wazirs 
funeral 
the palestinian leadership agrees that the body of our great 
struggler abu jihad should become a bridge for resuming relations 
between the plo and syria said nayef hawatmeh leader of the 
democratic front 
plo sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said syria 
intends to reconcile with arafat but that syrias relations with 
the united states appeared to be a stumbling block 
the syrians have been slowly mending fences with the united 
states in recent months washington has been seeking assads 
support for its latest middle east peace initiative but refuses to 
deal directly with the plo until it recognizes israel 
israeli sources said an israeli commando team carried out the 
killing of wazir under the direct command of lt gen dan shomron 
military chief of staff and took documents from wazirs home in a 
suburb of tunis 
they also told the associated press speaking privately that 
the government approved the mission on two other recent occasions 
but it was scrubbed both times for technical reasons 
prime minister yitzhak shamir on thursday said when asked about 
the assassination i suggest that we stop talking about this 
because i dont want to continue discussing it i dont think 
anyone has anything to say about this

gulf region over the next week in a longplanned and routine series 
of rotations the pentagon said thursday 
defense department spokesman dan howard said he was announcing 
the ship movements to head off speculation the united states had 
already decided to increase the size of its middle east force 
howard said earlier this week the administration was reviewing 
its gulf policies following clashes monday with iranian forces but 
he stressed thursday that review was continuing and the new 
deployments involved ships earmarked for a changing of the 
guard 
its been scheduled for some time its not a reinforcement

the navy tries to limit to six months the maximum deployment for 
any warship 
howard said five ships would leave east coast ports on april 28 
he identified them as the destroyer john hancock and the frigates 
fahrion halyburton nicholas and robert g bradley 
on april 25 the aircraft carrier forrestal and seven escorts

a house judiciary subcommittee on thursday 
unanimously approved legislation that would impose a fiveyear ban 
on the maufacture sale or possession of plastic firearms which can 
evade detection machines 
the plastic gun bill aimed at stopping terrorists at airports 
went to the full judiciary committee the panel could consider the 
legislation next week 
the legislation defines a plastic gun as one containing less 
than 37 ounces of metal rep william j hughes chairman of the 
subcommittee on crime said the metallic content was set at an 
amount that can trigger alarms on todays magnetometers 
he said the standard was agreed upon by the departments of 
justice treasury transportation and the law enforcement community 
the bill also would require firearm components to generate xray 
images which accurately depict the shape of the components 
there is no question but that such firearms once perfected 
will become the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals and 
pose an unnaceptable threat to the national security and public 
safety hughes said 
the bill would make it a federal offense to knowingly 
manufacture import sell transfer or possess a plastic firearm 
with maximum punishment of five years imprisonment there also 
could be fines of up to 250000 for an individual and 1 million 
for an organization 
rival legislation would require that guns be detectable but 
calls for no minimum metal content that legislation is supported 
by the national rifle association

gov mario cuomo scolded a crowd for booing 
mayor edward i koch on thursday then in an aside gave his 
former political rival some advice dont say anything about the 
primary 
the incident came at a housing rally on the upper west side of 
manhattan two days after the states democratic presidential 
primary in which koch raised the ire of many voters with his 
outspoken attacks on jesse jackson 
the result of kochs remarks cuomo told reporters later was to 
give new york a black eye he added that new york was 
erroneously perceived as some hellhole of contention and 
divisiveness 
koch endorsed tennessee sen albert gore jr who finished a 
poor third behind massachusetts gov michael dukakis and jackson 
cuomo remained neutral 
cuomo was wrapping up his comments about extending the 
mitchelllama housing law when koch arrived at the rally site 
im with you all the people up here are with you the mayor of 
the city of new york is with you cuomo said 
at that the crowd of 200 let loose as many boos as cheers and 
cuomo briskly moved back to the microphone 
hey wait wait wait a minute wait the governor called 
over the crowd wait a minute wait a minute you want to do me a 
favor please more boos erupted you want to do me a favor 
hold it 
cuomo asked if the group wanted the housing program extended it 
cheered he called koch one of the strongest voices we have on 
this mitchelllama bill he asked the crowd how do you feel 
about him in that issue 
the group cheered albeit grudgingly koch stepped up and began 
governor how do you do this 
cuomo moving past koch muttered laughingly to the mayor 
dont say anything about the primary 
koch chuckled hes amazing the mayor said and hes a 
good friend to have when you need a friend 
cuomo asked as he left if he thought new york got a black 
eye from the primary turmoil said yes i think we did get a 
black eye i think what happened is that mayor koch was perceived 
as being critical of jesse jackson and he attacked jesse jackson 
i wish he didnt 
cuomo added i think that there was no question that the 
public impression was that this is some hellhole of contention and 
divisiveness and everybody pushed everybody else it is not true

soto and at least one customer as a shield said ramiro guerrero 
news editor at the noroeste newspaper in the state capital of 
culiacan who was on the scene 
the customer marco antonio estrada was killed and soto 
received more wounds when the escape attempt led to a gunbattle 
between police and the robbers in which nine or 10 hostages 
were wounded lara said 
soto died at a hospital after the gunmen allowed red cross 
officials to escort him from the building guerrero said 
lara identified the other two people killed as manuel andoval 
rendon a bank official who died of a gunshot wound to the chest 
and cashier rosi maria padilla 22 who was reported shot in the 
face

because they cant afford to stay well those days in the 
commonwealth are over he said as the crowd applauded 
from now on when the sick land at the doorstep of our health 
care system the first question of them will be where does it 
hurt not how will you pay 
only hawaii which has an exemption to federal law allowing it 
to require employer health coverage has anything comparable to the 
massachusetts law 
however the massachusetts legislation which statehouse aides 
say has generated inquiries from more than 20 states goes beyond 
hawaiis approach by offering health security both to working and 
nonworking residents 
in his speech dukakis didnt specifically mention whether he 
would seek similar federal legislation if he became president but 
he did say today we make history but there is more history to 
be made 
as an american i dont want my country to stand alone with 
south africa as the only two industrialized nations that do not 
provide basic health security for their citizens 
the bill was the outcome of a ninemonth legislative struggle 
and comes two years after massachusetts voters endorsed a 
nonbinding referendum by a 2to1 margin urging congress to 
enact a national health care program universal in coverage 
the narrowly passed the legislature last week the doubters 
said a lot of things dukakis said and they were wrong 
but doubters remain dr david u himmelstein of harvard medical 
school and spokesman for physicians for a national health program 
called the health care bill a first step but said it was a 
bandaid approach when major surgery is needed 
and house minority leader steven pierce a republican described 
the bill as shortterm gain and longterm pain mike dukakis has 
managed to pick up some shortterm political gain at the expense of 
longterm fiscal pain for the commonwealth 
on wednesday dukakis estimated that the laws cost to taxpayers 
would be 6452 million through fiscal 1992 minus about 225 
million in projected costcutting in medicaid other estimates put 
the cost to the state government in the next four years as high as 
12 billion 
the thrust of the law is to provide coverage to about 600000 
massachusetts residents under age 65 currently without health 
insurance roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth 
this would be done in stages and through a variety of 
approaches from extending medicaid benefits for disabled adults 
and children to statebrokered pooled insurance for small 
businesses and individuals 
by 1992 all employers with more than five fulltime employees 
must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment 
surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured

sen brock adams dwash seeking to force a 
senate debate on the issue of war and peace in the persian 
gulf said thursday he will introduce legislation to authorize the 
continued presence of us military forces in the gulf and set 
rules for their use 
adams said he will also seek congressional action to trigger the 
war powers act which requires the removal of us forces from 
hostile areas within 60 days unless their continued presence is 
specifically approved by congress 
in the last year we have deployed dozens of american ships in 
the gulf adams said we have spent tens of millions of 
dollars we have asked americans to sacrifice their lives 
but congress has never authorized the deployment never 
appropriated any money never clearly stated its support for the 
policy that is being followed 
adams said a number of individual senators have offered the 
administration specific suggestions on changes or modifications in 
us persian gulf policy and some are being considered seriously 
but he said that is not enough 
the senate as an institution has to give some guidance to the 
administration adams said congress has a right and a 
responsibility to debate the policy being followed by the 
administration as well as the right to consider alternatives 
only by engaging in a full and frank debate only by working 
with our colleagues and having the administration work with us can 
we refine our approach to the problem and strengthen our national 
commitment to solve it he said 
the war powers act is a postvietnam attempt to apply a 
congressional brake to unilateral presidential decisions to expose 
us forces to possible hostilities it has been resisted by the 
reagan administration as an encroachment on the presidents 
authority as the nations military commander in chief 
adams said he realizes an attempt to invoke it will be 
challenged but said the act should be implemented because it 
remains the law of the land 
i am not trying to force the withdrawal of american forces 
from the persian gulf adams said we have a right to be there 
and a mission to perform there 
adams said he is only seeking to protect the constitutional 
right of the congress to be involved in decisions to deploy us 
forces into areas of hostility

sen albert gore jr gave up his 1988 white 
house bid thursday offering the strong suggestion that he harbors 
hopes of a future campaign and moving to protect the delegates he 
has won so far 
it hurts to have come so far and have fallen short gore 
told a senate office room crowded with supporters but there will 
be other days for me and for the causes that matter to us 
the tennessee senator ended the race deeply in debt after waging 
a longshot campaign that challenged the traditional dominance of 
iowa and new hampshire it succeeded in the south where he won 
favor as a moderate but fell flat elsewhere 
gore said he would technically remain a candidate to permit his 
delegates to attend the democratic national convention 
in suspending his campaign he delivered some of the most 
eloquent lines of his campaign praising each of his opponents 
excoriating republican george bush and pledging support for the 
eventual nominee 
i want no part of a stop jackson or a stop dukakis movement 
gore said the only man i want to stop is george bush 
i will not be the democratic nominee for president in 1988 
gore said the nominee is going to be michael dukakis or jesse 
jackson im going to do everything i can to help them do what i 
set out to do and that is to put a democrat in the white house 
gore exited with a joke after a failed campaign that he said 
lasted 10 months and a million miles 
i was doing great until i turned 40 he said 
gore amassed 423 democratic national convention delegates during 
his campaign according to the associated press count his decision 
to suspend his campaign rather than quit the race means the two 
remaining active candidates cannot pick up delegates he has already 
won but who have not yet been chosen 
under party rules jackson would have gained 34 of gores 
delegates immediately while dukakis would have gotten 29 illinois 
sen paul simons decision to suspend his campaign denied jackson 
another 47 delegates he would have inherited in this manner 
gore said he spoke with both dukakis and jackson and that both 
were comfortable with his decision to hold onto the delegates 
he said the move would protect democratic leaders who backed him in 
states where delegates had not yet been chosen naming georgia as 
an example 
he said he planned no endorsement and repeated his oftstated 
contention that he has no interest in the vice presidential 
nomination though he left that door open 
im not trying in any way to broker a convention that is not 
going to be brokered anyway he said 
gores withdrawal was assured by his dismal third place showing 
in new york a 10 percent finish that capped six weeks of 
frustration for gore since his sixstate victories on super tuesday 
in the south new york had become his last chance to get back into 
contention 
gore is saddled with a debt of more than 15 million run up in 
borrowing for his campaign in super tuesday states and after that 
in an effort to break through outside the south his debt is the 
largest of the 1988 presidential candidates who have departed the 
race although as a senator he is in a position to raise money to 
retire the debt 
he spent the night before his announcement in texas raising 
money to repay the debt 
facing little support in iowa and an appeal not in sync with 
that states leftofcenter democratic activists gore challenged 
the assumption that candidates must do well in iowas caucuses he 
bypassed the state and blasted its process as a distortion and 
concentrated on the south 
but gores campaign was marked by internal disorganization and 
division and a tendency to postpone decisions gore often made the 
decisions himself from the road 
one result was that gore spent nearly the maximum amount 
allowable in new hampshire over 400000 but did it late and 
without an accompanying commitment of time and campaign staff to 
campaign full force the result was he was neither fully in nor 
fully out there and finished fifth in a sevenway race 
he broke through with wins in six states in the south but then 
he went through the succession of northern states beginning with 
illinois and michigan largely an unknown figure and unable to make 
any progress

television series cheers came to capitol hill on thursday to 
announce formation of a new environmental coalition he said is 
aimed at stopping ocean pollution 
danson told a news conference that as president of american 
oceans campaign i am going to dedicate my resources and my 
ability as an actor to focus attention on the plight of our 
oceans 
he said the organization based in santa monica calif would 
be pushing for enactment of legislation to set a national policy 
for protection of the oceans with emphasis on 
reducing and then ending the dumping of toxics and sewage into 
coastal waters 
establishing national ocean parks to protect environmentally 
sensitive and economically important shorelines 
deferring offshore oil and gas development until there is a 
national energy policy that emphasizes conservation and alternative 
energy sources 
the groups multipurpose goals were questioned by carl schmid a 
spokesman for national ocean industries a trade group representing 
companies involved in offshore oil and gas activities 
i think its important the american people realize this is a 
facade to stop offshore oil development said schmid he said 
that some of american oceans campaigns directors including 
dansons wife casey are active in groups fighting drilling off 
the california coast 
they are using the other people other groups and congressmen 
to stop offshore oil schmid said i would question how much 
effort theyre going to devote to sewage sludge toxics and 
plastics pollution 
danson was not available to respond to schmids statement 
issued several hours after the news conference calls to american 
oceans campaign offices in santa monica and takoma park md were 
answered by recording devices 
danson said that his interest in ocean ecology was stirred 18 
months ago when he took his two daughters to a santa monica beach 
and a saw a sign saying no swimming water polluted 
we have always taken for granted that we can dump anything we 
want into the oceans all of our wastes all of our toxics and 
assumed that it would always be absorbed he said 
that is no longer true danson said dead fish are washing 
up on the beaches of the east coast and beaches are being closed on 
the west coast

canada will be a full partner in the 14 billion 
space station project intended to put a manned platform in space by 
the late 1990s industry minister robert de cotret announced 
thursday 
prime minister brian mulroneys conservative government had 
delayed a decision on the project for three months after the 
estimated cost to canada over the next 17 years escalated from 648 
million us to 972 million 
de cotret said 90 percent of the money will be spent in canada 
producing 4 billion in spinoffs beneficial to science and industry 
weve got a place in space he told a news conference he 
termed the project an investment in ourselves our ingenuity and 
our brain power 
about half the extra funds required will come from a 1 billion 
science and technology fund announced by mulroney in january it 
was originally intended solely for university programs 
canadas contribution will be a roving space robot to act as the 
hands and arms of the station the computerized robot would have 
sight touch and reasoning powers and would unload cargo repair 
satellites and do other tasks 
in return canadian astronauts would have access to the station 
for about three months a year for experiments 
the largest international civilian space venture in history will 
consist of three laboratories built separately in the united 
states western europe and japan and a giant metallic living 
module made by the americans 
canada is the final partner to join the consortium 
the government has yet to decide between montreal and ottawa as 
the headquarters for the canadian space agency that will oversee 
the project most of the countrys aerospace industry is located 
near montreal

the normal pleasantries of a congressional 
hearing were disrupted thursday by a charged exchange between a 
congressman and a cabinet secretary over their family backgrounds 
rep dale kildee dmich opened a hearing on his major child 
care bill by describing his own traditional upbringing he said his 
father worked at a buick plant and his mother stayed home to take 
care of her several children 
suggesting to education secretary william bennett that their 
backgrounds were similar he commented we must recognize that 
very often there is no father in the family we have to 
recognize that changing family structure whether we like it or 
not 
several minutes later when he got his turn to talk bennett 
bluntly and unexpectedly took issue with kildees assumption that 
they came from similar families 
i did not grow up in ozzie and harriets home or in a father 
knows best home it might have been nice to bennett said 
creating a sudden hush in the packed hearing room 
the education secretary said he came from a typical innercity 
broken family my father left home when i was quite young he 
said he and his brother were raised by his mother bennett said 
with the aid of informal child care arrangements 
she held two jobs my mother and put in whatever time she 
could with her children bennett said she did this without 
much benefit from the state or federal goverment although she 
could have used some help 
moments later kildee started to describe the need for child 
care in flint mich which he said has a 20 percent unemployment 
rate i have to walk through the real world he said im 
invited to country clubs but i dont go there often 
i do not belong to a country club any country club bennett 
broke in defensively and brooklyn where he grew up is every 
bit as much the real world as flint 
lets not be confrontational were talking about children 
kildee replied his voice rising in surprise 
bennett persisted some people believe all republicans were 
born rich 
i know tom tauke so i know thats not true kildee 
interjected quickly referring to the young iowa congressman 
sitting next to him the room filled with laughter and the tension 
broke 
but rep bill armey rtexas had the last word he said he was 
one of eight children of parents who both worked inside and outside 
the home in view of where he kildee and bennett have ended up 
armey said the evidence is clear no matter how you raise a 
child he can still go wrong

evidence in a closely watched cigarette 
liability case is sufficient for a jury to consider whether three 
cigarette manufacturers conspired to cover up the dangers of 
smoking and the trial should continue a judge said thursday 
the evidence presented permits the jury to find a tobacco 
industry conspiracy vast in its scope devious in its purpose and 
devastating in its results said us district judge h lee 
sarokin 
at the same time sarokin dismissed a claim that the three 
companies sued in the liability case liggett group inc philip 
morris inc and lorillard inc caused rose cipollones lung 
cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette 
the judges comments came in a 33page opinion requested by the 
cigarette makers who asked for dismissal of the case and an end to 
the trial that began feb 1 
the companies are being sued by mrs cipollones husband 
antonio cipollone of lakehurst whose wife died at age 58 in 1984 
after smoking for 40 years attorneys for cipollone completed their 
case two weeks ago alleging that mrs cipollone was a victim of a 
campaign by the cigarette makers to undermine warnings about the 
dangers of smoking 
in the opinion that was quite pointed at times sarokin said the 
jury should be allowed to consider the conspiracy and punitive 
claims in the case 
sarokin said evidence indicated the companies conspired to 
conceal and misrepresent information on the dangers of smoking and 
to refute undermine and neutralize information coming from the 
scientific and medical community 
he said the evidence also indicated the companies tried to 
confuse and mislead the consuming public in an effort to 
encourage existing smokers to continue and new persons to commence 
smoking 
the jury may reasonably conclude that defendants were members 
of and engaged in that conspiracy with full knowledge and disregard 
for the illness and death it would cause and that mrs cipollone 
was merely one of its victims the judge said 
as for punitive damages sarokin said if the jury accepts the 
plaintiffs version of the facts as to the conduct of the 
defendants it is difficult to envision a more compelling case for 
an award of punitive damages 
cipollones attorneys said they were pleased with the opinion 
the judge says we have a case for the jury attorney cynthia 
a walters said 
if a case should be won this is it she said adding that 
her side introduced as evidence secret internal cigarette company 
documents never before made public they included memorandums that 
spoke of a public relations war against healthrelated charges 
involving cigarettes 
chuck wall a spokesman for philip morris and lorillard took 
exception to the tone of sarokins opinion 
i do think there were flourishes there from the judges pen 
that went beyond the plaintiffs evidence he said 
wall also said he believed the heart of cipollones case was 
gutted by sarokins opinion the conspiracy claim is very tenous 
at best he said 
sarokin dismissed a claim that the companies were liable for 
mrs cipollones death on the basis they knew how to design a safer 
cigarette but failed to the judge said cipollones attorneys could 
not prove mrs cipollone would have smoked the safer cigaratte had 
it been marketed 
ms walters said the dismissal of that claim which the defense 
contended was the heart of the case was not a critical blow 
we thought it was an important theme not so much for this 
case but for the broader implications in future cases she said 
sarokin also dismissed a claim that the companies failed to do 
enough research on the dangers of smoking while there was ample 
evidence that the research was inadequate the judge said 
cipollones attorneys did not prove that this directly harmed mrs 
cipollone 
another claim that the companies failed to warn smokers of the 
dangers of cigarettes was also dismissed against philip morris and 
lorillard but the judge said the jury will be able to consider 
that allegation in the case of liggett 
sarokin said mrs cipollone began smoking cigarettes made by 
philip morris and lorillard after 1966 when the federal government 
began requiring warnings on cigarette packs 
however she smoked cigarettes made by liggett prior to 1966 and 
there is evidence from which the jury could infer that prior to 
1966 ordinary consumers were not adequately informed of the health 
risks of smoking he said 
james kearney an attorney for liggett said the company was 
confident we will prevail on the basis of evidence that comes out 
during our presentation

before douglas gerwitz was 24 hours old 
he had been taken from his mother found 170 miles away by a police 
officer who happened to be his godfather and sent back to his 
parents 
albert cecil duane lewis 25 and judy k lewis 32 were being 
held by authorities in holbrook where the infant was found in the 
back seat of a car said prescott police capt bob reed 
its a heck of a coincidence said officer douglas newton 
after he found his godson and namesake 
the 4hourold son of lisa and john gerwitz of the payson area 
had been taken from prescotts yavapai regional medical center 
about 7 pm wednesday police said a a woman masquerading as a 
hospital laboratory worker told the mother she was taking the baby 
for some tests 
hospital officials realized the child had disappeared about 45 
minutes later when mrs gerwitz asked a nurse when her son was 
going to be returned to her prescott police sgt bill clayton said 
just after midnight judy lewis entered the holbrook police 
department and asked for travelers aid such as gas money and a 
place to stay sgt stewart bracke said 
newton was helping ms lewis who said she was alone when he 
discovered she actually was traveling with a man and a baby bracke 
said 
police found the three matched the description of a man and 
woman seen in the hospital and the missing baby they were able to 
confirm the babys identity three hours later 
after little douglas was examined at holbrook community hospital 
and pronounced in good health authorities drove him back to 
prescott 
he was reunited thursday afternoon with his parents at the 
hospital mrs gerwitz appeared briefly with the baby in her arms 
to thank law enforcement officers hospital personnel and others 
who assisted in getting her son back 
newton knew the kidnapped babys parents from high school 
bracke said 
hospital administrator michael vitek said lewis apparently 
pulled off her masquerade as a laboratory technician by dressing in 
a lab coat she probably picked up in the hospitals obstetrics area 
lab coats are in the nurses lounge and on hall trees in the 
ob department hospital policy is that when our ob nurses go to a 
different part of the hospital they put on the lab coats to 
minimize infections vitek said 
vitek also said hospital officials will review the entire 
package of hospital policies relating to security of infants 
we expect to have some feedback from the investigators from 
the prescott police he added

communist rebels threatened thursday 
to attack any development projects funded by the us and canadian 
governments on the impoverished island of negros 
in another development thursday about 10000 militant farmers 
marched through manila to demand land reform 
the national democratic front branch on negros said us and 
canadianfinanced projects there were being used as tools to 
oppose the revolutionary movement 
the front is the communist rebel umbrella organization 
it said the projects were among targets singled out by the 
rebels as they prepare to step up attacks on negros 300 miles 
southeast of manila other targets include military units 
multinational corporations and individuals considered enemies of 
the people 
the threat came in a statement signed by rebel roman catholic 
priest frank fernandez and sent to news media in bacolod negros 
fernandez heads the negros chapter of the front 
hours later suspected communist rebels shot and killed a 
policeman and a militiaman in an ambush near a cemetery in bacolod 
police said 
the statement did not specify any single project and did not say 
if the attacks will include assassinations of us and canadian aid 
personnel 
us and canadian aid officials were not in their manila offices 
thursday and could not be reached for comment it could not be 
ascertained if any american or canadian personnel were stationed on 
negros island 
the us embassy said earlier it had stepped up security and 
told its staff to take extra precautions after communist rebels 
killed three americans and a filipino in attacks last october 
outside us clark air base north of manila 
another front statement circulated during daylong marches and a 
rally in manila by the leftist philippine peasant movement urged 
farmers to join the 19yearold insurgency it said the rebels had 
redistributed land to farmers in areas they control and that 
revolutionary land reform and armed struggle are the only ways to 
free the farmers 
several legislators including president corazon aquinos 
brotherinlaw sen agapito aquino and priests and nuns joined 
the protesters they urged the farmers at a rally to pressure 
congress to pass a meaningful land reform law 
thursdays marches and rally were peaceful and the protesters 
dispersed at sundown without incident but jaime tadeo leader of 
the protest denounced the military for blocking thousands of 
farmers as they approached manila in motorcades early thursday from 
seven outlying provinces 
the most rev teodoro bacani roman catholic auxiliary bishop of 
manila said the church backed the farmers demand for immediate 
land reform and said there was a need to wake up 
legislators consciences if they are asleep 
last july mrs aquino decreed a nationwide land redistribution 
program but left most details up to congress 
the senate and the house approved separate land reform bills 
last month but still have to reconcile differences in the two 
drafts which peasant groups say favor landlords

president reagan said thursday he is 
very concerned that the senate may not ratify the pending 
ussoviet arms control treaty before he goes to moscow for summit 
talks with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
in a questionandanswer session after a speech to the world 
affairs council of western massachusetts reagan was asked by a law 
student what the effect on the talks would be if the senate had not 
yet ratified the treaty 
i think it would be very upsetting and would put a strain on 
the summit if the senate has not ratified the treaty by the time we 
go there the president said 
we hope and pray that they will but their scheduling of it 
has been such that i am very concerned we may have to go without 
having had it ratified he said 
replying to reagan senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva told a news conference he will not schedule the treaty for 
debate until a dispute is resolved on whether or not the pact bans 
futuristic weapons such as those using laser beams or particle rays 
he said this can be done only by attaching a reservation to the 
treatys resolution of ratification or by obtaining an 
authoritative and binding commitment from the soviets 
the date of the summit does not drive me at all and it should 
not drive the senate byrd said this treaty is in a vacuum by 
itself and the senate has to make a judgment remember were 
dealing with the soviet union i want to be sure all the is are 
dotted and all the ts are crossed before the senate acts on 
ratification of this treaty 
i want this treaty byrd said i have no doubt it will be 
approved at some point but i want to be absolutely certain our 
interpretation that the treaty bans mediumrange futuristic 
weapons is authoritative and documented by the soviets as being 
their interpretation and their commitment likewise 
it isnt my fault that those who negotiated this treaty didnt 
bring this issue into the procedings byrd said 
he said he has no objection of opening debate on the pact on may 
9 if the issue of futuristic weapons is resolved by then but he 
said that once debate begins many amendments will be offered to the 
treaty by opponents 
i dont know how much time it will take byrd said 
the pending treaty covering intermediate and shorterrange 
missiles was signed by reagan and gorbachev at their summit 
meeting in washington in december 
when the two leaders meet again in moscow may 29 to june 2 one 
of the issues confronting them will be a treaty still being 
negotiated that would cover longerrange intercontinental nuclear 
missiles 
of this treaty reagan said there is a great question as to 
whether it could be ready for signature at the summit 
we dont want a fast treaty he said we want a good one 
on another issue the president was asked about a trade bill 
being considered on capitol hill reagan said that if it reaches 
his desk in its present form he will veto it 
he also said he would immediately ask congress to enact a new 
bill that did not contain provisions to which the administration 
objects including a requirement for companies to give workers 
notice of plant closings 
in response to a question about the trade deficit reagan said 
that in the latest government report the deficit went up a little 
bit they didnt say a little bit they made it sound horrendous 
something about around 13 billion plus in trade deficit what they 
didnt add was that exports had been at the highest level seen so 
far 
in his speech to the group which was billed as a scenesetter 
for the upcoming summit reagan proclaimed a period of realistic 
engagement between the united states and the soviet union 
even while freedom is on the march sovietamerican relations 
have taken a dramatic turn into a period of realistic 
engagement reagan said 
two of the most basic rights that we have called on the 
soviets to comply with the president said are the right to 
emigrate and the right to travel how can we help but doubt a 
government that mistrusts its own people and holds them against 
their will 
and what better way would there be to improve understanding 
between the united states and the soviet union than to permit free 
and direct contact between our two peoples in the new spirit of 
openness why doesnt the soviet government issue passports to its 
citizens i think this would dramatically improve ussoviet 
relations 
on afghanistan reagan told his audience now the soviets say 
they have had enough 
but let me say here that the next few momths will be no time 
for complacency no time to sit back and congratulate ourselves 
the soviets have rarely before and not at all in more than three 
decades left a country once occupied they have often promised 
to leave but rarely in their history and then only under pressure 
from the west have they actually done it 
turning to the treaty on intercontinental missiles now being 
negotiated which both sides have said they have some hopes of 
signing in moscow reagan said that the treaty on medium and 
shorterrange missiles signed in december is reality and now the 
senate should give it ratification 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters on the 
flight from washington aboard air force one that we think 
everyone wants to ratify the treaty before the summit the impetus 
is for that to happen it would be a shame if it did not happen we 
think we can overcome any obstacles but there are still hurdles to 
be crossed

mick jagger took the witness stand 
thursday to defend his hit song just another night against a 
reggae musicians charge of plagiarism saying the first time he 
heard the other mans song was after the lawsuit was filed 
jagger that he he started in music 25 years ago in england he 
had composed 200 to 300 songs both alone and with keith richards 
guitarist in the rolling stones 
reggae musician patrick alley 36 of new york city is suing 
jagger claiming the famed rolling stone took the chorus from 
alleys 1979 song also called just another night and used it 
in jaggers 1985 solo hit 
jaggers testimony came on the fourth day of the trial jagger 
told the jury that the first time he heard alleys song was in his 
attorneys office in 1986 after the lawsuit was filed 
his attorney peter parcher asked jagger what he thought of the 
song and he said i dont want to cast aspersion on mr alley a 
lot of people in this courtroom dont like my music personally i 
dont really like that song 
jagger testified that he often recorded songs by other artists 
and had no hesitation in giving them credit 
for more than an hour the jury and a courtroom filled with fans 
and reporters heard how jagger developed his song beginning with a 
november 1983 tape which jagger described as just me with 
acoustic guitar starting off with this tune 
several tapes were played detailing how jagger other musicians 
and arranger carlos alomar developed the song into the form that 
would ultimately appear on his 1985 solo album shes the boss 
jagger rocked back and forth to the beat as the tapes played 
sometimes seeming embarrassed as on the tape he grunted or made 
other sounds as substitutes for lyrics 
he said that on none of the tapes did drummer sly dunbar appear 
dunbar who appeared on the final cut of jaggers song allegedly 
was the drummer on alleys song in 1979 dunbar has testified that 
he couldnt remember 
alleys lawyers say jaggers song netted as much as 6 million 
the courtroom had been set up with amplifying equipment in 
anticipation that jagger would perform but that did not occur 
thursday 
another of jaggers attorneys gerald margolis said hell 
play if he has to if the only way to prove it and show it he 
will 
jagger was scheduled to resume testifying friday afternoon 
earlier thursday a music expert testified on his behalf that 
the two songs were very different and that the title just 
another night was fairly common 
daniel ricigliano chairman of the theory department at the 
manhattan school of music said that while the rhythmical settings 
of the two choruses were similar because of the similarity of 
lyrics and ideas the choruses were totally different in every 
musical way 
he testified that a review of song titles at the performing arts 
library in lincoln center revealed more than a dozen songs since 
1928 with the title just another night 
earlier in the week alleys expert witness juilliard teacher 
andrew william thomas said his analysis of the songs found the 
choruses to be virtually identical 
outside court wednesday jagger had said my credibility is on 
the line because of this i think its pretty obvious to 
everyone that the songs are entirely different aside from a few 
words and the title 
he called the trial a ridiculous waste of time 
alleys chorus lyrics are can i spend another just another 
night just another night just another night with you 
jaggers lines are give me just another night just another 
night with you give me just another kiss just before the dawn 
breaks through 
the jury is to determine only whether there was an infringement 
of alleys copyright if the jury finds in alleys favor the 
parties can arrange a settlement on damages or can have damages 
determined at a second trial

a new federal government with 
fewer departments and a drastically reduced staff was appointed 
thursday in a move to tighten the belt on czechoslovakias 
bureaucracy 
the official ctk news agency said the new 20member government 
was appointed by president gustav husak the changes however were 
proposed by the communist party leadership at a recent meeting 
the previous 26member government resigned wednesday one day 
after parliament rubberstamped a communist party central committee 
decision to merge five ministries into two 
in czechoslovakia changes in government are decided by the 
party leadership 
lubomir strougal remains premier in the new government which 
has six deputy premiers instead of ten there had been some 
speculation that strougal might be replaced 
the new government now has ten ministries three less than 
previously 
times were never easy for governments strougal said but 
these are the most difficult times 
we know what we want but at the same time we must count on 
many unexpected phenomena which we shall have to solve both in 
economic and social development as well as in internal and foreign 
policy where more activity and initiative is needed on our part 
strougal said 
czechoslovakia has adopted the rhetoric of reform over the past 
year but has proceeded cautiously in making changes like those 
carried out in the soviet union under mikhail s gorbachev 
husak who was replaced as party leader in december by milos 
jakes said each minister is to look critically at the area he is 
responsible for 
the governments of the czech and slovak republics also were 
reorganized reducing their ministries by four and three 
respectively 
the shuffle apparently is designed to streamline government 
bureaucracy and spur the countrys economy 
the communist party daily rude pravo said the staffs of the 
federal and republican governments are to be cut by about 30 
percent rude pravo said thousands of people would be fired 
through the reorganization of state administration 
however it said no one would be left without a job 
the process must be aimed primarily at ensuring the growth of 
quality and performance of the managing aparatus and at a good and 
effective use of the released workers primarily in places and 
professions where manpower has been lacking so far ctk quoted 
rude pravo as saying 
former deputy premier ladislav gerle now heads a newly created 
ministry of metallurgy engineering and technology which merges 
three separate ministries the ministries of communication and 
transport were combined under vladimir blazek the former minister 
of transport 
the only new member of the government according to sources in 
prague is marian calfa minister without portfolio who is in 
charge of government coordination

solidarity trade union movement read a speech listing workers 
demands including acrosstheboard pay raises of 50 a month she 
said 
the average wage in poland is about 90 a month

the union had called for the demonstration in leaflets 
distributed over the past two weeks said ms kubema 
it began at 2 pm the end of the first shift with a whistle 
from the factorys locomotive repair shop she said at that time 
there were about 10000 workers at the plant

solidarity and sang the national anthem holding up their hands 
in vforvictory signs 
she said there were no arrests at the rally but lawyer 
wladyslaw liwak secretary of the solidarity committee at the 
factory was detained at his home 
solidarity was banned after the 1981 martial law crackdown in 
poland but local units continued to function clandestinely at many 
factories 
in a shift of union strategy last year new units were organized 
publicly and dozens of them have unsuccessfully gone to court 
seeking legal registration under a 1982 labor law 
government price increases of 40 percent took effect this year 
part of the governments program of economic reform at the same 
time workers in socialized enterprises received an automatic 15 
monthly pay raise 
authorities expressed concern that factory managers under 
worker pressure will be too generous about awarding additional 
wage increases they warned managers they could lose their jobs 
unless wage increases are merited by higher productivity

a senate subcommittee voted thursday to cut 
spending for president reagans star wars program but also 
generally granted administration requests for the midgetman and mx 
missiles congressional sources said 
the votes by the armed services subcommittee on strategic 
weapons and nuclear deterrence came behind closed doors as the 
panel began working on a bill authorizing the pentagon budget for 
the fiscal year starting oct 1 
the panel voted to approve 46 billion for the strategic 
defense initiative as reagans star wars plan is formally known 
according to the sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified 
reagan had sought 48 billion for star wars which is 
authorized for 39 billion in the current fiscal year 
the panel also voted to generally approve reagans request of 
about 200 million for research into the singlewarhead midgetman 
and 800 million for research into basing the 10warhead mx weapon 
aboard trains on western military reservations the sources said 
the subcommittee decisions if they are eventually affirmed by 
the entire armed services committee and then the full senate will 
set up another fight with the house 
although both chambers are controlled by democrats reagans 
defense budget requests have generally fared better in the more 
conservative senate and thursdays votes continued that trend 
the defense bills which separately pass each chamber will 
eventually go to a housesenate conference committee to iron out 
differences 
the house will next week begin considering a defense budget bill 
which authorizes 4 billion for star wars 600 million less than 
the senate subcommittee voted thursday 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee says he expects the full house to approve the 4 billion 
figure after a fight by liberals who want to reduce it more and 
conservatives who want to raise it 
the house measure also raises spending on the midgetman from 
reagans request of 200 to about 500 million while reducing the 
mx request from 800 million to 500 million 
the midgetman is the singlewarhead missile which is backed by 
congressional democrats but opposed by the pentagon defense 
secretary frank carlucci said he wanted to eliminate the midgetman 
program but agreed to include 200 million at the request of 
congress to keep the program alive until reagans successor can 
make a decision about the fate of the program

five gunmen fled one of whom had an arm wound 
i think the other two mixed in among the crowd at the moment

two california dialaporn operators were 
fined 600000 each by the fcc on thursday for transmitting obscene 
material across state lines and for not restricting access to their 
messages to children and nonconsenting adults 
some socalled dialaporn providers are blatantly 
disregarding the law which required that access by minors be 
restricted pursuant to commission regulation fcc chairman dennis 
r patrick said in announcing the fines we intend to enforce 
this law 
the companies audio enterprises inc of mill valley and 
intercambio inc of san jose were fined for interstate 
transmission of obscene material and failure to restrict such 
transmissions from minors and nonconsenting adults the maximum 
fine is 50000 for each day of violation 
the ultimate in sleeze deserves the ultimate penalty 
fcc commissioner james h quello said they need to know we mean 
business 
gerald brock chief of the fcc common carrier bureau said the 
600000 fines were based on the amount of money the companies made 
during the commissions monitoring process 
in an 11month period atampt received 55 million from calls 
made to one audio enterprises inc line patrick said of that 
amount audio enterprises received 650000 he said intercambio 
inc received 297000 from its operation 
the decision was the result of an fcc investigation triggered by 
complaints alleging that unimpeded access to the sexually explicit 
messages resulted in the molestation of one 10yearold girl and so 
disturbed a 16yearold boy that he had to enter weekly psychiatric 
theraphy 
the companies have 30 days to pay or seek reduction of the fines 
current fcc regulations direct the dialaporn companies to 
restrict their messages through access codes message scrambling or 
use of credit card numbers 
upon being notified last december of the complaints both 
companies said they did not have the capacity to provide access 
screening and denied that the messages were obscene intercambio 
also argued that it had not violated the regulation because it 
never intended to transmit to minors or on an interstate basis 
in a statement atampt said its policy was to terminate service 
at the fccs direction for any customer found in violation of laws 
concerning minor access to pornographic messages

vice president george bush and his wife 
barbara paid 86684 in 1987 income taxes on a total income of 
308396 according to a tax return released by his office on 
thursday 
that compares to the 115486 that the bushes reported paying 
for 1986 on total income of 348594 
bushs tax bill amounted to 28 percent of his total income in 
1987 down from the 33 percent he paid in 1986 showing that he as 
president reagan and many other americans benefited from the 
sweeping taxlaw changes that took effect for 1987 taxes 
bushs income included his 112633 salary as vice president and 
2048 in additional reimbursment from the government 
his biggest chunk of outside income came from the blind trust he 
and his wife set up when he took office totaling 169600 
including 26075 in capital gains 31264 in interest and 
dividends and 112261 in supplemental income 
precisely where this money came from was not detailed under 
terms of the blind trust agreement aides have said previously that 
the trust is valued at about 1 million 
bush also reported 20773 in passive income from his 
interest in a liquefied natural gas barge 
bushs salary was up from the 97900 he received in 1986 
reflecting a general raise in federal salaries 
the main reason his total income was lower was because he had a 
much lower level of capital gains income from sales of assets 
property or stock 
in 1986 bush reported total capital gains of 430165 
apparently reflecting a decision by the trustees of his blind trust 
to sell off assets before the new tax law changes took effect and 
increased the tax on such gains 
bush has made returning to a lower rate of taxation on capital 
gains a prime campaign theme saying the decision to tax capital 
gains at the same rate as other earnings stifles business 
investment bush has proposed a capital gains tax of 15 percent 
the bushes claimed total deductions for 1987 of 53314 
including 12225 in contributions to 35 charities the 
contributions included 1000 gifts to the yale alumni fund and the 
united negro college fund 
bush had made 89588 in tax payments including 32588 
withheld from his salary suggesting a refund of 2904 however 
the vice president elected to have the money held and applied to 
his 1988 taxes 
bush also reported 1575 in royalties in 1987 on his book 
looking forward published by doubleday last september 
the vice president claimed 3574 in deductions for business 
meals and entertainment and 6880 in miscellaneous business 
deductions 
bush has released his tax returns annually 
in january he also released 14 years of previous returns in a 
challenge to thenrival sen bob dole to do the same those returns 
showed that 1986 was his biggest income year and that over the 
14year period he paid taxes ranging from 3 percent to 41 percent 
of his annual income 
bushs interest income included 66 from the white house credit 
union 
president reagan released his tax return earlier this month it 
showed that he and his wife nancy paid 86638 in taxes on total 
income of 345359 down from their 92460 tax bill on 1986 total 
income of 336640 
the internal revenue service estimates that by next year when 
the taxlaw changes are fully in place about threequarters of all 
americans will have smaller tax bills than they had in 1986

for the people and not as a defender for himself he said in a 
speech

the crew of the korean air lines plane shot 
down by soviet fighters in 1983 negligently made the flight knowing 
the navigation system was not working a lawyer for the victims 
relatives argued thursday 
donald madole lead counsel for a committee that represents the 
relatives of those killed in the sept 1 1983 crash of flight 007 
said there was abundant evidence to show that the crew chose to 
continue the flight even though it determined in alaska that the 
navigation system was not properly set before takeoff from 
anchorage 
a total of 269 passengers and crew died when the flight which 
originated in new york city was shot down over the sea of japan 
after straying off course into soviet air space 
the plane ended up 320 miles off course because the inertial 
navigation system ins had been improperly set during a fueling 
stop in anchorage madole said 
from the moment that airplane took off it was never never on 
course he told us district judge aubrey e robinson jr 
the crew deliberately attempted to conceal their failure to 
either properly stabilize the ins or set it up properly madole 
said 
the pilot and crew knew the journey without navigation guides 
would lead the plane into a dangerous area where it could be shot 
down without warning if it strayed into soviet airspace madole 
said 
obviously the crew knew the danger and chanced it anyway he 
said 
but kal attorney george tompkins said these allegations were 
based on opinion surmise conjecture rather than evidence 
there is no need for a trial in this case tompkins told 
robinson who has presided over five years of litigation arising 
from the crash 
madole said the plaintiffs should be given a chance to press 
their claim of punitive damages at a trial 
even before the flight had left the coast of alaska for the long 
journey across open seas the crew had violated a number of 
aviation regulations madole said 
the plane should have flown directly over the radio beacon at 
bethel alaska to check its position when the crew determined it 
was 15 miles off course madole said but the crew members ignored 
their duty and didnt fly the plane over the radio beacon because 
they knew the navigational system was not functioning 
once the plane passed over the coast there is no white 
highway line across the pacific madole said 
the pilot capt chun byungin wanted to avoid returning to 
anchorage to reset the nevigation system because such an emergency 
landing would force him to dump 100000 pounds of jet fuel chun 
knew this costly and timeconsuming detour would anger airline 
officials and passengers madole said 
he cited the deposition testimony of former kal pilot park yong 
man who said he and chun had spoken the night before the illfated 
flight about four other incidents that year in which kal crews had 
made emergency landings to reset navigation systems 
chun had told park if it happened to him he would go on to 
avoid losing face with his superiors and friends madole said it 
would be a terrible disgrace in korea if they have to come back 
authorities have not been able to determine exactly how the 
plane ended up 320 miles off course because the cockpit and flight 
data recorders were never recovered but aviation experts theorize 
that incorrect data was punched into the computerized navigation 
system before the plane took off from anchorage 
if the judge dismisses the case the airline would only be 
liable for 75000 per passenger under international aviation 
conventions but the plaintiffs are seeking to collect far greater 
amounts by holding the airline liable for punitive damages

attorney general edwin meese iii said thursday 
he meets the highest ethical standards expected of public officials 
and knows of no factor right now that would cause me to resign 
but the attorney general in an interview published in fridays 
editions of usa today did not rule out resigning before the end of 
president reagans term 
ive never set a particular limit of how long i would stay or 
how long i wouldnt stay a lot would depend upon my own 
postfederal service employment situation and so on he said 
meese said he does not believe he is a liability either to the 
administration or to the presidential bid of vice president george 
bush 
i dont feel that im tainted i feel that there have been 
false accusations and false charges meese said 
meese has been under criminal investigation for nearly a year by 
independent counsel james mckay who is looking into his ties to 
the scandalplagued wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil 
pipeline project 
mckay is also known to be looking into mrs meeses 
40000ayear job with the multiple sclerosis society mrs 
meeses salary is underwritten by the bender foundation a 
taxexempt philanthropy run by a washington real estate family 
the associated press reported last week that a partnership 
headed by howard m bender the foundations vice president owned 
a building for which the government signed a 50 million lease for 
a justice department office building in may 1987 thirteen days 
after signing the lease the bender partnership sold the building 
for a 226 million profit 
meese has denied any wrongdoing and said he didnt have anything 
to do with the lease 
meese declined to answer whether he would resign if his presence 
in reagans cabinet became a liability for bush but he said the 
only reason an attorney general should resign is if he is indicted 
or if the president asks him to step down 
i dont know of any factor right now that would cause me to 
resign meese said 
he said public officials should meet the highest ethical 
standards and added i personally believe that in my case i 
meet that standard and thats why im interested in having the 
facts come out 
the president has continued to express his total support 
and total confidence meese said 
meese said he usually meets with his personal lawyer after work 
or on sundays it is not taking me away from the office 
during office hours hardly at all and in no way is it hampering 
the decisionmaking of the department

the 1988 democratic presidential marathon dwindled down to two 
survivors on thursday as sen albert gore jr called it quits 
frontrunner michael dukakis said jesse jacksons showing 
guarantees him consideration when it comes to picking a vice 
presidential running mate but nothing more 
if i were to finish second it wouldnt entitle me to anything 
more than consideration period dukakis said in an interview in 
boston before he flew off to campaign in pennsylvania and ohio the 
next primary states on the calendar 
jackson spent the day in pennsylvania buoyed by an endorsement 
from the philadelphia daily news i am the alternative in the 
democratic party i am the alternative to reaganomics he said as 
he made the rounds on a hectic campaign day 
we can win we can win he said 
the ubiquitous public opinion polls suggested otherwise 
a survey taken for television stations in philadelphia and 
pittsburgh showed dukakis favored by 55 percent to 24 percent for 
jackson and 6 percent for gore that represented an improvement in 
dukakis position since his big victory in the new york primary 
which established his control over the presidential race 
pennsylvania votes next week and offers 178 democratic delegates 
jackson with philadelphia mayor w wilson goode at his side 
toured a neighborhood notorious for drug sales on thursday night 
calling on hundreds of blacks and hispanics who turned out to see 
him to stay away from drugs 
when i become president the drug pusher is in trouble he 
said 
dukakis flew to cleveland to campaign in advance of ohios 
primary a week after the pennsylvania contest he made a strong 
attack on reagan administration trade and labor policies 
we have a labor department and an nlrb national labor 
relations board that wont stand up for america because we have 
got an attorney general who couldnt tell the difference between 
antitrust and antifreeze dukakis said 
gore meanwhile exited the race with a quip 
i was going great until i turned 40 he told a roomful of 
family members and supporters in the senate 
the tennessee senator said he would technically remain a 
candidate so his delegates can attend the democratic national 
convention this july in atlanta 
but he said i will no longer campaign in the hope of winning 
the nomination i want no part of a stop jackson or stop 
dukakis movement 
the only person i want to stop is george bush and were going 
to stop george bush 
vice president george bush is clearly heading for the republican 
nomination and the only suspense is when he will amass the 1139 
delegates needed for clinching it the best guess is tuesday night 
in pennsylvania 
gore who sought the nomination as a southern moderate 
alternative to the other contenders left the campaign at least 
15 million in debt after failing to build on his southern 
successes in any northern or midwestern states his campaign had 
soared march 8 on super tuesday when he carried kentucky arkansas 
north carolina oklahoma and his native tennessee and he holds 
more than 400 delegates in the associated press count 
under democratic party rules jackson would have gained 34 of 
gores delegates right away and dukakis would have gotten 29 if 
gore had made a clean break and dropped out of the race entirely 
dukakis leads in the delegate chase with more than 1000 and 
jackson holds more than 800 
the massachusetts governor is the prohibitive favorite for the 
nomination given his delegate lead and the momentum he gained with 
his new york triumph but in an interview with the ap he said it 
was too early to talk of picking a running mate 
i have spent literally zero time thinking about it and i will 
not unless and until i have either won the nomination or it looks 
as if its pretty well in hand he said 
even so he seemed to brush aside a prediction from party 
chairman paul kirk that the vice presidential running mate would be 
a senator from the south or southwest i wouldnt make that 
judgement at all dukakis said 
if dukakis wasnt ready to discuss the issue others were 
obviously you look at regions where you could use some help 
said former gov charles robb of virginia the south and west are 
the regions you also look at a philosophical segment where you 
could use some shoring up and i guess that would be with moderate 
conservative voters 
robb who had urged sen sam nunn of georgia to run for 
president said he would like to see nunn as the vice presidential 
candidate but only if the senator were offered the opportunity to 
serve as secretary of defense at the same time

after 6 years and an expense of 
500000 barbara and frederick hughes have a jury finding that 
they were slandered and a buck apiece in their pockets 
i got my name cleared hughes said wednesday after jurors 
ruled that greater palm beach symphony chairman ethel stone 73 
slandered the hugheses during a disagreement over funds that was 
aired at a symphony board meeting in august 1981 
all three were involved in fundraising and operations of the 
symphony a central part of the social scene in socially conscious 
palm beach 
barbara hughes 59 worked as treasurer for the symphony in 
1981 frederick 72 was on the board of directors 
so it caused something of an uproar in the posh resort community 
when mrs hughes and ms stone both of palm beach accused each 
other of misappropriating symphony property and money 
ms stone sued the hugheses for defamation the hugheses 
countersued ms stone 
ms stone agreed to settle her lawsuit against the hugheses out 
of court in december last year when hughes insurance company 
offered 150000 the hugheses plan to appeal that settlement 
we spent over a halfmillion dollars mrs hughes said 
referring to their own lawsuit in return for their time and 
expense a jury awarded the couple 2 in damages 
at that 1981 meeting ms stone told the board in view of 
television cameras that the hugheses had improperly handled 
symphony money during the twoweek trial jurors watched tapes of 
the statements which her lawyer james brown said ms stone made 
after consulting with an attorney 
after palm beach circuit judge daniel hurley read the verdict 
wednesday ms stone said she thought she had been advised before 
the meeting by the best law firm in town 
despite the victory in principle for the hugheses trial analyst 
kus nell who assisted attorney thomas ogrady in representing the 
hugheses thought the six jurors ignored the damage done to the 
hugheses when they determined the 2 award 
im stunned how 1 will compensate mr hughes nell said 
noting how much more ms stone reaped in december from the 
outofcourt settlement by the insurance company 
she never went to trial she never proved a thing and she got 
150000 nell said we went to court for two weeks and got 
this 
the trial attracted attention for the years of bitterness and 
thick volumes of court documents it has generated 
after the charges and countercharges were made in 1981 the 
hugheses told the state attorneys office that symphony records and 
100000 in cash and donations were missing 
after seven months of scrutiny investigators criticized sloppy 
accounting procedures but found nothing of criminal substance

prizes in literature art and architecture told tass the three 
films helped soviet society deal with the legacy of stalins 
decades in power 
millions of soviets were shot imprisoned or exiled in the 
dictators purges

an alleged drug trafficker to the united states

what appeared to be young and illtrained troops who fired long 
bursts of fire from their m16s into the air the sound of shots 
sparked panic in the neighborhood 
some demonstrators taunted and threw stones at the troopers who 
at intervals would advance behind metal shields 
at least one person was seen arrested there were no immediate 
reports of injuries 
during the milelong march earlier thursday protesters chanted 
slogans calling for the expulsion of the approximately 1100 us 
troops based in honduras the removal of usbacked nicaraguan 
rebels from honduras and the defense of the honduran constitution 
they condemned the government of president jose azcona and what 
they called his subservience to washington 
yankee garbage out of honduras and if the yankees dont 
get out in honduras they will die shouted the demonstrators 
both chants rhyme in spanish 
the marchers most of them students walked to the national 
congress where they listened to speeches condemning azcona and the 
united states 
about 500 demonstrators proceeded from there to the nearby 
central penitentiary where they shouted for the release of inmates 
they consider political prisoners 
a group then tried to go to the us embassy 
one of the issues the marchers protested was the forced 
extradition of suspected drug trafficker juan ramon matta honduran 
police working with us agents arrested matta at his tegucigalpa 
home on april 5 had him flown to the united states 
the honduran constitution prohibits the extradition of honduran 
citizens 
matta is in federal prison in marion ill 
the us embassy estimates damage to the consulate building in 
the april 7 riot at between 4 million and 6 million and has asked 
for reimbursement from the government

fired moscow communist party boss boris n yeltsin 
has defended the outspoken criticism of the slow pace of reform 
that cost him his job telling the official press that he did what 
he thought was right 
in another published report yegor k ligachev the kremlin no 
2 man considered a conservative counterforce to yeltsin in mikhail 
s gorbachevs leadership was reported to be in trouble with the 
soviet leader 
the respected madrid newspaper el pais reported thursday that 
ligachev had been removed from his duties as the partys chief 
arbiter on ideological issues and head of party workers at an april 
16 meeting 
the new york times reported friday that the politburo voted to 
reduce ligachevs powers and ordered him to take a twomonth 
vacation it said ligachev was forced to give up his role as a 
supervisor of soviet press and television 
the paper said that viktor m chebrikov head of the kgb had 
defended ligachev during the politburo meeting which it said took 
place tuesday 
unconfirmed reports circulating in moscow said ligachev recently 
had been given a reprimand by gorbachev but it was unclear when or 
why 
the interview with yeltsin along with a large picture of him 
and his grandson was published in the first germanlanguage 
edition of the newspaper moscow news which appeared thursday in 
moscow the article was not in the weekly russian language edition 
that came out wednesday 
i spoke in a straightforward manner and said what i felt and 
thought was correct yeltsin said in the interview his first in 
the official press since his firing someone said correctly each 
must think independently so that later not all suddenly see the 
light at once 
he declined to say what he told the communist party central 
committee at an oct 21 meeting that led to his firing three weeks 
later yeltsin was hospitalized with heart trouble in november and 
since has been reassigned as a first deputy minister of 
construction 
even though moscow news is intended primarily for foreigners 
the appearance of an interview with yeltsin was unusual and could 
be a signal that he has recovered some prestige following his 
denunciation by gorbachev in midnovember for putting personal 
ambitions above the interests of the party 
yeltsin 57 was considered to be among the staunchest 
supporters of gorbachevs efforts to reform the soviet economy and 
allow more openness in his speech to the central committee he 
criticized the slow pace of reform and the partys style of 
leadership 
some unconfirmed reports have said he attacked ligachev 
personally 
yeltsin was replaced as moscow party chief by lev n zaikov in 
february yeltsin was stripped of his position as a candidate or 
nonvoting member of the ruling politburo 
yeltsins firing was taken by some moscow intellectuals as an 
indication of the limits of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness gorbachev acknowledged that in a speech to 
writers and artists in january but denied that it signaled a 
slowing of his reform efforts 
yeltsin was brought to moscow by gorbachev from the ural 
mountain industrial city of sverdlovsk to replace viktor grishin 
reported to be gorbachevs main rival for the communist party 
leadership in 1985 
moscow news said 102000 copies of the first germanlanguage 
edition were printed in west germany and sold at kiosks 
it said editors in moscow provide all the material for the 
paper which is composed printed and distributed in west germany 
it is printed in a larger format than the editions printed in five 
other languages 
in its story on ligachev el pais cited unidentified informed 
soviet sources as saying the politburo turned over his duties to 
gorbachev ally alexander yakovlev secretary of the partys central 
committee and the partys chief director of propaganda press and 
cultural matters 
the papers moscow correspondent described the action as a 
failure of the political operation against gorbachev by 
conservative party figures who attracted attention following the 
publication of a newspaper article defending stalinist policies 
ligachev was said to have endorsed the article and guided 
through its publication in the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya the 
communist party newspaper pravda published a strongly worded 
condemnaton of the critical article april 5 
ligachev has indicated in speeches on ideology during the past 
year that he favors a less permissive attitude toward openness in 
publishing than gorbachev 
conservative writers have cited ligachevs speeches in attacking 
the increasingly critical articles that are appearing in soviet 
newspapers including moscow news

a computer hacker who sent messages to prince 
philips computer cannot be prosecuted under the countrys 
counterfeiting and forgery laws britains highest court ruled 
thursday 
stephen gold and robert schifreen were arrested separately in 
1985 for breaking into the prestel system the information service 
of british telecom the nations telephone company 
gold of sheffield and schifreen of london were convicted in 
1986 of nine offenses and fined 1140 and 1425 respectively 
five law lords of the house of lords members of an unelected 
upper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges unanimously 
upheld a court of appeals ruling last year that said the two men 
could not be prosecuted as charged under the forgery and 
counterfeiting act 
their conduct amounted in essence to dishonestly gaining 
access to the relevant prestel data bank by a trick said lord 
geoffrey lane that is not a criminal offense if it is thought 
desirable to make it so that is a matter for the legislature 
rather than the courts 
i knew from the start that the forgery act is not designed to 
apply to unauthorized access to computers and that has now been 
proved said schifreen i am not saying computer hacking should 
be legal but there should be a specific law to cover it 
he said the messages left on prince philips computer were not 
terribly interesting mostly congratulations on the birth of 
his grandson prince william the elder son of prince charles and 
princess diana

the international air transport association 
criticized algeria on wednesday for freeing the gunmen who hijacked 
a kuwait airways jetliner and killed two kuwaiti passengers 
they will have gone back into the mainstream of terrorism and 
we can assume we have not heard the last of them that is cause for 
concern in the airline industry said rodney wallis association 
security director 
we now have the possibility that a number of trained hijackers 
could lead missions of their own wallis told the associated 
press 
the 15daylong hijacking ended wednesday with the release of 31 
hostages algeria allowed the proiranian hijackers to escape 
the terrorists reportedly nine in number had demanded that 
kuwait release 17 proiranian terrorists convicted and imprisoned 
for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait in december 
1983 
wallis noted that algeria is not a signatory to the 
international convention on hijacking which calls on authorities 
to secure the safe release of passengers recovery of the aircraft 
and apprehension or extradition of the hijackers 
algeria succeeded in the first two parts but not the third 
there was a requirement for all three processes said 
wallis a former executive at british airways 
our worries are now that youve got people who have 
experienced the seizure of an aircraft and the holding of hostages 
over a lengthy period and they are now back in circulation 
he noted reports that the hijackers told some of their hostages 
that the plane seizure was only the first of a series of planned 
hijackings 
the algerians should have negotiated from strength since the 
hijacking had gone for so long and the terrorists must have 
realized they could not achieve their goal he added 
the international air transport association a trade association 
representing 170 international airlines and headquartered in 
montreal is investigating how the kuwaiti aircraft was seized 
while it was en route from bangkok to kuwait 
it has asked thai authorities for permission to send a team to 
review security operations at bangkok airport wallis said we 
are awaiting a formal response 
he said information received by the association indicates 
security was lax on the day of the hijacking but there is no 
definitive conclusion as to where the weapons went on board 
the association has called for the establishment of an 
international court to try hijackers an international detention 
center to jail them and an international force to negotiate with 
hijackers and to mount a rescue attempt if talks fail

for three centuries language has divided 
canadas two founding cultures the novelist hugh maclennan 
prophetically called it the two solitudes of english and french 
despite some progress toward bilingualism at a federal level as 
promised in the 1982 constitution language tensions have flared 
anew from frenchspeaking quebec to the western prairies where 
english is dominant 
a fluently bilingual prime minister brian mulroney about to 
start his reelection campaign has suddenly found himself diverted 
into quelling anglophone and francophone unrest 
three issues have converged to create the new turmoil 
the province of saskatchewan has repealed an 1886 act requiring 
it to issue laws in both english and french alberta is expected to 
do the same 
the supreme court is about to rule on quebecs controversial 
ban on english signs quebec is 81percent french but the vocal 
english minority in la belle province claims the ban violates 
freedom of speech and is unconstitutional 
mulroney faces opposition from members of his own progressive 
conservative party in the west over a proposed new official 
languages act that would strengthen bilingualism in federal courts 
and institutions 
the populace will be seething and smarting as it pays for 
bureaucrats who communicate with one another in a language french 
which close to four out of five canadians cannot understand said 
ted byfield publisher of western report magazine 
trying to balance historic sensitivities in quebec with the need 
to keep his base of support in the west mulroney told parliament 
that canadas first prime minister in 1867 had to handle the 
linguistic rift and im sure it will be the case 120 years from 
now 
language issues will always be there to trouble and upset us 
and even to divide us he said 
at stake for mulroney is the meech lake accord he negotiated 
with all 10 provinces last year bringing quebec into the 
constitutional fold as a distinct society and purporting to 
protect the rights of linguistic minorities elsewhere 
several provinces have balked at ratifying the deal and now 
complain that the accord reached at meech lake in quebec rings 
hollow when put to the test 
premier robert bourassa of quebec came in for particularly harsh 
criticism during visits in midapril to saskatchewan and alberta 
neighbors on the prairies 
he refused to condemn the provinces for not honoring a feb 25 
supreme court decision that said their laws should be issued in 
both english and french under an 1886 statute 
the historic failure to provide laws in french had prompted a 
frenchspeaking priest the rev andre mercure to contest a 
saskatchewan speeding ticket he died before the case reached the 
supreme court but it was a pyrrhic victory for the provinces 
25000 francophones since the court suggested that saskatchewan and 
alberta could repeal the old law and replace it with an 
englishonly policy 
thats exactly what premier grant devine of saskatchewan has 
done arguing that the province cannot afford to reenact all laws 
in french in the province of just over 1 million people only 
25000 speak french and they also speak english 
pressed to intervene bourassa told reporters i am not a 
federal politician i was not elected to represent alberta or 
saskatchewan 
george ares a francophone leader in saskatchewan blasted the 
premier as a traitor to the french cause outside quebec 
hes backpedalling added aurele theriault director of the 
federation of francophones outside quebec federation des 
francophones hors quebec 
bourassa chose to praise devine for pledging to translate some 
laws into french and permit use of the language in the courts and 
legislature while setting up language classes for civil servants 
mulroney meanwhile told devine that his actions had national 
implications and offered federal funds for expanding bilingualism 
in the province 
bourassa is also under pressure at home where he pledged in his 
1985 election campaign to lift the ban on bilingual signs but when 
an english department store zellers was firebombed last year 
after adding english to its signs bourassa retreated for the sake 
of what he termed social peace 
with the supreme court ruling on signs pending federal 
languages commissioner diberville fortier stirred the controversy 
by accusing the french in quebec of humiliating their english 
neighbors 
royal orr president of the englishrights pressure group 
alliance quebec maintained that a new language crisis could prompt 
the exodus of 100000 quebec english speakers who are a major 
economic force in the province 
frankly i dont think quebec can sustain that kind of loss 
on another front quebecs culture minister lise bacon 
proposed new film distribution laws tightly restricting the number 
of englishlanguage movies that can be screened in the province 
meanwhile the government insists that its new official 
languages act is merely an attempt to comply with the constitution 
not a means of enforcing compulsory bilingualism in regions where 
its not wanted 
but opponents claim every federal court and agency will be 
required to have bilingual judges and staff and those unable to 
speak french will be bypassed for jobs and promotions 
its a tragedy said alex kindy a conservative member of 
parliament from calgary alberta i think quebec is moving more 
and more towards unilingualism and the rest of canada is going to 
be forced to be more and more bilingual 
to frenchcanadians whose ancestors arrived in north america 
before the british language preservation is their birthright 
if the rights of francophones had been respected since the 
last century maybe there wouldnt be so few of us now said 
andre cyr of the acadian federation of nova scotia which has about 
31000 french speakers 
francophones have just as much right to be here as 
anglophones we founded the country too 
ironically all three major political parties support 
bilingualism as do major newspapers but in the worlds second most 
spacious country the language issue falls victim to demographics 
of canadas 25 million people about 62 million speak french 
but 53 million of those live in one province quebec where 
french is the sole official language and a majority never speak 
english 
new brunswick the province bordering maine is onethird french 
and the nations only officially bilingual province of ontarios 
93 million people 425000 are francophones 
west of winnipeg in manitoba however not even one in 10 of the 
areas 67 million people lists french as their native tongue 
former prime minister pierre elliott trudeau promoted 
bilingualism to defuse the separatist movement in his native 
quebec and english and french were declared the official federal 
languages in 1969 federal documents are issued in both languages 
government departments have bilingual names and unilingual civil 
servants are paid to take language classes 
in cities such as toronto anglophone parents have enrolled 
200000 children in french immersion schools the most promising 
sign of real change 
but in most regions from newfoundland to british columbia 
bilingualism has been slow to take root

ross daly was a shaggyhaired irish 
cellist when he left california on a musical journey that followed 
the hippy trail to afghanistan and india 
eighteen years later hes an internationally acclaimed 
performer of traditional middle east music the plaintive kind 
that westerners used to call weird and outlandish 
it wasnt enough being in london and learning the sitar in a 
vacuum the 36yearold musician said i wanted to find out how 
eastern music really worked that meant exploring and it took a 
long time 
on the road daly took lessons from traditional musicians 
wherever he could find them in workers cafes or at moslem 
weddings even at the whirling dervishes monastery at konya in 
turkey 
theres a kind of camaraderie among musicians theyd show me 
things maybe not all the tricks but enough to get me started on 
playing in an authentic way he said 
daly performs and composes on a dozen exotic stringed 
instruments from the stubby turkish oud a member of the lute 
family to the resonant afghan rambaba and his favorite 
oldfashioned cretan lyra 
his two latest albums one solo and another with an 
international group he formed and called lavyrinthos the greek 
spelling for labyrinth received firstrate reviews both in 
greece and abroad 
ross is important for what he does to preserve the middle east 
musical tradition and because he doesnt just imitate he 
innovates as well said lucy duran an american musicologist who 
heads britains national sound archive in an interview 
a childhood spent in japan england and the united states gave 
daly what he said was an eclectic approach to music that meant i 
wasnt stuck in the western classical groove 
his american music school training was useful for studying the 
structure of oriental music and then dissecting its regional 
variations 
we talk about greek music being different from turkish or 
syrian from egyptian but in fact theyre all part of a common 
musical tradition that stretches all the way from bulgaria to india 
and goes back centuries he said 
thats what daly and his group which includes turkish 
armenian greek and american musicians tries to illustrate in 
performances that attract sellout audiences in athens clubs and 
cultural centers their music strips down traditional oriental 
themes to reveal haunting melancholy melodies or mesmeric rhythms 
we dont use amplifiers and we like to play to no more than a 
couple of hundred people that means we cant really be 
considered a good commercial proposition for a mass market daly 
said 
but after a dramatic rise in record sales over the past six 
months daly is preparing another album and also working on a 
documentary feature about traditional east mediterranean music for 
british television 
his time is split between performances and recording sessions in 
athens a home on the island of crete and concert trips to western 
europe but he still travels in the middle east several months a 
year to work on his repertoire and add to his collection of several 
hundred oriental instruments 
among greek composers and instrumentalists who regret the loss 
of skilled techniques as the local musicmaking tradition declines 
daly is admired for his performing talents as well as his original 
work 
hes a tremendously sensitive musician whos developed a deep 
feeling for our music he extracts its essence in his 
compositions said composer manos hadjidakis who won an academy 
award for scoring the film never on sunday in crete daly 
sometimes puts on a traditional black shirt to play the lyra at a 
village wedding which may last for 24 hours of feasting drinking 
and dancing 
he is famed for his ability to extract a rich melodic tone from 
the pearshaped toysize instrument which has threestrings and is 
played with a bow 
people think the lyra is a peculiarly cretan instrument but 
ive found it all over asia minor and it must have been around 
since byzantine times i fell for it as soon as i heard it daly 
said

a federal program to severely restrict 
pesticide use in the forests and farm lands where endangered 
species roam may itself be endangered because of a lack of federal 
dollars 
the us environmental protection agency opened a 90day public 
comment period march 9 on a plan to enforce the endangered species 
act in areas where pesticide use overlaps with the habitat of 
endangered species 
remaining hearings are scheduled for april 28 in kansas city 
mo may 3 in sacramento and may 6 in phoenix ariz 
the 1973 endangered species act requires all federal agencies to 
ensure their activities or those they monitor do not harm critical 
wildlife habitat the epas problem according to several officials 
close to the agencys program is that it doesnt have the funds to 
monitor and enforce pesticide restrictions 
we dont have the money epa spokesman al heier said in a 
telephone interview from washington dc were hoping in the 
meantime that where there are endangered species that people would 
voluntarily protect them where thats possible 
most of the farmers would try to comply said merlin fagan 
of the california farm bureau but if one would look at the 
thousands of dollars it could cost we might be asking a lot 
fagan said the presticide program is a joke without the 
money to monitor pesticide use and verify the presence of 
endangered wildlife 
jay feldman of the national coalition against the misuse of 
pesticides contends the epa is claiming empty coffers to avoid 
taking action that would affect farmers 
i think hidden behind the excuse of money is a real reluctance 
on the part of the epa to regulate pesticides that are seen to have 
a impact on agricultural production he said its a lack of 
decisive action that plagues the agency not a lack of resources 
one example of an animals potential impact on agriculture is 
the san joaquin kit fox this endangered creature roams 340000 
prime acres in fresno county an area with crops valued at 584 
million that could be ruled offlimits to pesticides 
the push to protect wildlife stems from a 1986 epa internal 
report that slammed the agency for failing to implement the 
endangered species act 
the report included hundreds of complaints filed by the us 
fish and wildlife service alleging the epa had neglected to protect 
wildlife where pesticides are used according to laurie mott of the 
natural resources defense council in san francisco 
asked about the report heier said what it said was that we 
were not implementing the endangered species act for old 
pesticides 
the report coupled with criticism from environmentalists 
prompted the epa to propose strict regulation within specific 
habitats of any pesticide registered before 1978 heier said 
pesticides registered after 1978 when new rules required more 
complete chemical information comply with the law he said 
angry farmers last fall forced a delay of the programs 
scheduled february start because the epas maps of rare plants and 
animal habitat were inaccurate fish and wildlife service director 
frank dunkle wrote last october that enforcing the program based on 
bad maps could develop a backlash among pesticide users 
the epa plan affects 900 counties nationwide pesticide labels 
would list specific counties where chemicals could threaten 
endangered species growers then would obtain a map to determine 
restrictions on the chemicals use 
violations of the law can be punishable by fines of up to 
20000 and oneyear prison terms 
last years plan proposed restrictions on 
24 chemicals for forestry use affecting 58 plant and animal 
species 
9 mosquito larvacides affecting 78 species 
29 pesticides for use on rangeland affecting 182 species 
64 chemicals for croplands affecting 45 species 
county agricultural commissioners would be a farmers main 
source for chemical restriction information said james wells 
chief of the california food and agriculture departments pesticide 
enforcement unit 
as for money to implement and enforce this vast program on the 
local level wells said thats one of the problems nobody in 
epa has said anything about money in fact they said there is no 
money 
without federal funds wells speculated the state of california 
would have to absorb the programs cost the state would have to 
help with mapping and enforcement or divert federal funds now used 
for other programs 
heier said it would probably take two years before the program 
gets into full swing

when terence knox signed on to play sgt zeke 
anderson in cbs vietnam war series tour of duty it sounded 
like a dream job a starring role in a network show shot on 
location in beautiful hawaii 
its not what its cracked up to be its work said knox on 
a recent visit to drizzly new york 
i hasten to say that what we go through is nothing compared to 
what the veterans went through in real warfare but i can at least 
appreciate it a little bit at least a peeping toms perspective on 
being away from home in a hot place where it rains a lot and where 
you dont really see civilians 
civilians for knox and the rest of the cast and crew are the 
tourists who stay at the same honolulu hotel there is no 
fraternizing 
people come in waves of like two weeks in hawaii so theres 
no meaningful relationship to be struck up here joked the young 
and single knox especially when people are in a zany kind of 
getatanintwodays mentality i mean you cant even seduce 
anyone when theyre thinking about a suntan 
a typical 14hour shooting day is often spent crawling around in 
dusty tunnels or muddy swamps sometimes across the island the cbs 
detective series magnum pi would be filming in a decidedly 
more genteel atmosphere where series stars dont have to worry 
about being killed off in the name of authenticity kevin conroy 
was the first casualty among the regulars on tour 
none of us is immune im glibly sitting here munching french 
bread in a restaurant today but well see said knox whose job 
is presumably safe since he has top billing 
knox is deeply dedicated to the series and frustrated by the 
lack of audience tour premiered last fall with a 
sophisticated filmquality style good writing and fine 
performances but it has not prospered in the ratings 
it spent most of the season opposite the cosby show on 
thursday night at the unseemly early hour of 8 pm eastern time 
its ratings improved somewhat in its new saturday 9 pm time 
period cbs executives who will announce the networks fall 
schedule in may say they remain confident in the show 
i still believe that if you work hard enough at something it 
deserves a shot knox said you just wont believe how hard 
some of that stuff is to do and how dangerous nothing compared to 
what the real veterans went through the technical advisers come 
out there who are veterans without exception before the end of 
their episode they come up and say we had no idea you guys 
worked this hard 
the way knox plays him sgt anderson is a nononsense guy who 
has reupped for the second time after finding a kind of success on 
the battlefield he couldnt find in civilian life anderson has no 
interest in politics he just wants to get his men out alive 
veterans groups praised cbs when it announced plans for tour 
of duty last year the response from viewers who are veterans has 
been overwhelmingly positive knox said he said the show gets 
a lot of mail from veterans who say they were unable to talk about 
their experiences until they saw tour of duty 
cbs didnt undertake this show as therapy for anybody knox 
said it was entertainment going to be quality entertainment 
and it has remained that but in addition it has become a great 
bringing together of these forces people who had never talked 
about it the war before 
before tour knoxs bestknown role was dr peter white on 
nbcs st elsewhere a role he thought would be a sixepisode 
shot but it developed into one of the most popular subplots on the 
critically praised series when white turned out to be a rapist he 
was later killed off 
it made life hell in the singles bars for awhile knox said 
with a laugh 
before st elsewhere he said his biggest role was in a 
minor film starring a 70000 mack truck and myself and the 
truck was better than i was

driven by a mothers love and a penchant for 
publicity maria desillers defied all tradition of parental 
patience and forbearance in the wait for donor organs to try to 
save her 7yearold son ronnie 
one year after her only childs death despite three liver 
transplants ms desillers still is fighting but public sentiment 
is no longer on her side and her battle has moved into 
pennsylvanias civil courts and attracted the attention of florida 
legal authorities 
i sit here with pictures all over the walls of my son i sit 
here and ive lost him and im fighting for other peoples kids and 
im being criticized ms desillers said in a telephone interview 
from miami to have people criticize me without knowing all the 
facts its very painful 
with the first anniversary of ronnie desillers death on friday 
falling coincidentally within national organ and tissue donor 
awareness week she said it hurts even more 
april 29th is going to be a year and it hasnt gotten any 
easier for me she said when i see kids playing i get very 
emotional everything brings back memories one thing i keep 
hearing over and over is ronnie saying mommy i love you with all 
my heart 
the 32yearold former public relations consultant who is 
divorced from ronnies father has withheld 261189 owed 
childrens hospital of pittsburgh the worlds leading liver 
transplant center she alleges her sons third transplanted liver 
was defective and that a potential fourth liver was turned down the 
day he died 
the hospital which stands by its care of the boy is suing ms 
desillers for the money 
his treatment was beyond criticism we still dont succeed in 
all cases although we do in the vast majority said dr thomas 
e starzl director of transplant surgery at childrens and its 
affiliate presbyterianuniversity hospital we cant match the 
anguish a bereaved mother would have but theres a very real pall 
of sadness that settles over us when a patient dies the 
controversy surrounding ronnies case only amplifies the scar 
and cheapens the boys memory starzl said 
hoping to spur a federal investigation of childrens hospital 
ms desillers last month released a series of internal memos in 
which anesthesiologists criticized the liver transplant program 
the memos complained of poor communication among doctors 
inadequate review of failed cases and general confusion one memo 
cited a case in which two livers were switched about like peas 
under shells a member of pittsburghs transplant oversight 
committee an advisory group of two general physicians and six 
civic leaders later explained the livers were swapped for medical 
reasons and that both operations succeeded 
in florida meanwhile officials are investigating the way ms 
desillers handled the hundreds of thousands of dollars ronnie 
received from countless americans including president reagan a 
fund that provided the initial 163113 payment to the hospital 
a state audit this year put the total amount ms desillers 
deposited in seven accounts at two florida banks at 980310 a 
figure ms desillers says is far too high 
the money poured in after 4000 collected by ronnies 
classmates was reported stolen in february 1987 a burglary still 
under investigation by fort lauderdale police 
even after arriving at childrens with her increasingly ill son 
ms desillers championed his cause like few parents before on 
television shows and in frequent calls to reporters she also 
stressed the need for organ donation and spoke out on behalf of 
others awaiting transplants 
by the time ronnie died the single bank account in his name had 
accumulated 509913 according to fred kerstein chief of the 
economic crimes division in the office of the state attorney in 
miami as of midfebruary the balance was 239288 he said 
those assets were frozen last month by a dade county judge who 
appointed a curator for the estate 
kerstein says ms desillers spent at least 47000 of the 
missing money on jewelry clothes furniture a bmw automobile and 
a biscayne bay apartment he declined to break down that figure or 
elaborate on additional expenditures because of his offices 
investigation into possible fraud and other criminal violations 
ms desillers says she never squandered any of the donations and 
gave as much as 175000 to families of transplant patients 
she says she bought her 1984 bmw at an auction for 13000 and 
her onebedroom apartment doubles as her office which she 
furnished with a computer and other equipment the apartment rents 
for 850 a month but she says her oneyear lease includes three 
free months 
some of her own money was deposited with the donations she 
says and she used it to buy back jewelry she had pawned to pay 
medical bills she says she also used some of the money to repay 
loans she took out to get ronnie to pittsburgh 
people dont realize i was not an accountant and i was not an 
attorney and i did not have guidebooks she said 
ms desillers is appealing a 1000 fine for violating floridas 
solicitation of charitable contributions act which mandates that 
solicitations for single individuals go solely to the beneficiary 
she maintains she never asked for donations but received them 
through sympathetic news accounts 
reacting to the furor a florida senate committee approved a 
bill on april 20 to more strictly regulate charitable contributions 
ms desillers has also been criticized for paying herself 300 a 
week as president of the ronnie desillers national foundation i 
was working 17 hours a day she said in her defense 
the doubts and bitterness raised by the desillers case have 
hardly been a boon to organ donation 
it has made people even more suspicious of the transplant 
field in terms of fairness and equity and i think therefore it has 
had a dangerous effect on the willingness of people to be organ 
donors said arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical 
ethics at the university of minnesota 
on the other hand caplan said the case highlights the 
inadequacy of the way in which we fund innovation and progress in 
medical research families shouldnt need to beg for money or 
depend on charity 
the desillers case has also made fund raising more difficult 
according to mary ann lunde chairman of the national organ 
transplant education foundation in fort lauderdale 
its sort of heartbreaking when you think about how this 
community south florida responded to ronnie desillers needs 
and now its having the opposite negative impact mrs lunde 
said 
ms desillers is chronicling her and ronnies struggle in a book 
she began writing four months ago she says it includes 
everything that happened in the hospital names dates 
circumstances 
i know theres a reason for everything that happens and i know 
in the end out of the ashes comes the phoenix she said i 
know in the end it will be for the good of other children that 
ronnie died

the scenery is magnificent the snowcapped 
elburz mountains rising majestically outside the capital 
but cynical residents say the credit for that belongs to saddam 
hussein the president of iraq which has been at war with iran 
since 1980 
in normal times the elburz mountains are often obscured by a 
curtain of smog 
but since the missile war of the cities prompted a mass 
exodus from tehran pollution has radically declined 
hussein could become minister of the environment was the 
ironic comment of an iranian interpreter who accompanied a western 
press group on a recent visit to iran 
about half of tehrans 6 million perople by private estimates 
8 million plus are believed to have left the city after it became 
the target of longrange iraqi missiles 
many who stayed are frightened 
in the hope that reinforced concrete will offer protection 
against the missiles the wealthy have packed the major hotels 
paying a room rate of 6100 rials a night that is 9150 at the 
official exchange rate and is more than one tenth of a workers 
average monthly salary 
some lowincome families have moved into improvised air raid 
shelters often underground parking lots taking along carpets and 
other personal belongings anyone who loots an empty apartment 
faces an ancient punishment the right hand is cut off 
the iraqi missile attacks have already claimed more than 1000 
civilian lives in tehran chiefly in the poorer quarters fears of 
a further escalation have mounted since iraqs gas attack at 
halabja a kurdish town in northeastern iraq after it was captured 
in an iranian offensive in march 
iran claims that 5000 civilians were killed and 7000 injured 
in the attack 
iraq recently acknowledged for the first time that it has been 
using chemical weapons barred by 1925 geneva protocols its claim 
that iran is also using them has been emphatically denied by tehran 
and diplomatic sources here say they have no reason to question 
that denial 
how long will the war continue 
iran has said it will accept a ceasefire only if iraq is 
formally identified as the aggressor by the international community 
and is punished it demands the ouster of hussein as iraqs 
president and several hundred billion dollars in reparations 
an iranian businessman who spent several years in the west said 
most people are tired of the war but generally fail to understand 
why the united nations cannot rule it was iraq that started it 
that would be the first step to a solution he said 
but iraq refuses to accept the blame and the matter remains in 
dispute 
we will fight until final victory a crowd chanted during 
one recent friday prayer service on the tehran university campus 
iran with a population estimated at 466 million three times 
that of iraq has an inferior arsenal and airpower it has already 
paid a heavy toll by the end of 1986 the number of dead or 
wounded was estimated by the stockholm peace research institute at 
750000 it said the actual figure may be much higher 
the economic costs of the war are staggering chiefly because 
iraqi air attacks have slashed oil revenues and refinery 
capacities in 1986 according to the local press iran had to 
spend 15 billion of scarce foreign exchange to pay for imports 
that otherwise would have been covered by oil exports this was 
more than twice the total of revenues from nonoil exports led by 
persian rugs 
coping with runaway inflation has become a daily chore for the 
average iranian 
basic food is rationed and most is still relatively inexpensive 
the price of a kilogram 22 pounds of bread is the rial 
equivalent of 60 cents at the official conversion rate but a 
kilogram of rationed meat is 1050 a worker making the equivalent 
of 600 a month has to moonlight to support a family 
the prices of nonessential items are soaring they range from 
330 for a toy f14 tomcat fighter plane made in taiwan with us 
military markings and 360 for a pair of turkishmade blue jeans 
to 19500 for a 13yearold paykan car with a britishmade 
hillman engine and an unspecified number of miles on it 
quite a few iranians apparently can still easily afford such 
prices and even greater luxuries however

private wealth has been widely left untouched by ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis islamic revolution and free enterprise is 
encouraged by the koran the islamic holy book the black market 
has become so much a part of the economy that the free exchange 
rates are regularly quoted by the national news agency irna 
and although the united states remains the great satan the 
us dollar is the preferred currency and at the freeexchange rate 
one dollar fetches 1165 rials 17 times the official rate 
i know of a woman who still flies to paris every spring to buy 
a new collection of clothes spending perhaps 15000 or more 
said one european resident at a dinner party replete with whiskey 
rock music and dancing all forbidden in shemiram the elegant 
section in northern tehran 
shemiram has been spared by iraqi missiles so far but even 
there some villas and apartments are empty because their owners 
have fled to caspian sea resorts or the elburz mountains where 
islamic rules require men and women to ski on separate trails 
the shemiram section also includes the residence of the 
86yearold khomeini who looks in relatively good shape according 
to diplomats who recently saw him at his mosque 
growing popular discontent with the unequal sharing of the wars 
financial burdens may have been at a root of his recent fatwa or 
binding religious guideline that strengthened the hands of the 
government 
up to now key economic reforms have been blocked on religious 
grounds by the council for the protection of the constitution a 
watchdog body dominated by islamic fundamentalists 
tax collection has been sluggish deputy finance minister ali 
majedi said recently taxation capacity was twice that currently 
collected a western diplomat termed his estimate a gross 
understatement 
god knows that even the filthy capitalist system in the west 
is not like that a legislator sahed ali akbar tahaili recently 
complained in the majlis the 270seat parliament he was referring 
to a huge tax debt run up by one of the various foundations 
controlled by religious authorities 
when someone moves to another state in the united states all 
his records are checked to make sure he has paid all his taxes 
the legislator added 
the new parliament formed after the april 8 general elections is 
widely predicted to step up pressure for reforms with the position 
of its pragmatist speaker hashemi rafsanjani strengthened further 
reformers may face an uphill battle official figures cited by 
the newspaper etelaat suggest that black market trends are 
determined by speculative money worth tens of billions of dollars 
there is little doubt however that the role of the mullahs

generations of workers and slaves transported 
granite blocks 600 miles down the nile river to erect the 57ton 
colossus of memphis 
nearly 3200 years later sophisticated engineers at bostons 
museum of science were perplexed about how they would handle the 
giant statue honoring ramses ii the last great pharaoh of egypt 
and the empires most prolific builder 
while preparing for an exhibit of artifacts from his 66year 
reign engineers grappled with methods to bring the 27foot 
structure into the museum proposals to demolish a wall or cut a 
hole in the roof were deemed infeasible and too costly 
so we decided to put it outside said mary dussault a 
project coordinator for the ramesses the great exhibit which 
opens april 30 and runs for four months i have to say it looks 
pretty majestic 
exhibit directors use the preferred translation of the pharaohs 
name ramesses instead of the more accepted anglicized version 
ramses 
the giant statue depicts ramses wearing the coneshaped crown of 
upper egypt royalty and a pleated skirt jewels adorn his neck and 
wrist as he strides forward left foot first 
the colossus was uncovered by crews digging the foundation for a 
building in 1962 near memphis egypt it was broken into three 
large pieces and many fragments about 30 workers began to 
reassemble the statue in 1985 doing the reconstruction in the area 
where it had been discovered 
the colossus of memphis will stand outside the museum encased 
in a 40foot wood and steel structure resembling an ancient 
egyptian temple the monument is the centerpiece of the 72piece 
exhibit the largest collection of antiquities from egypts golden 
age ever on display in north america 
the ramses show is larger than the 55 artifacts seen by more 
than 8 million people in the tutankhanum exhibit which toured the 
united states and canada in the late 1970s and generated more than 
50 million 
priceless antiquities from the reign of ramses the great were 
first seen in north america in october 1985 at brigham young 
university that show went on to be displayed at the worlds fair 
in vancouver british columbia jacksonville fla and memphis 
tenn 
the three sections of the colossus and dozens of crates 
containing other artifacts from cairos egyptian museum arrived in 
boston last week from denver 
the exhibit insured by lloyds of london for 40 million was 
designed to depict the grandeur as well as the simplicity of life 
under ramses ornate jewelry including a 19pound gold necklace 
with braided collar and 14 tassels are displayed along with such 
prosaic items as a cosmetic case a bronze razor and senet a board 
game popular at the time 
theres also the lid from the mummy coffin that contained 
ramses remains the elaborate burial chamber of sannedjem a 
respected painter and artisan and several statues of baboons from 
the temple at abu simbel 
ramses left a rich legacy of monuments and buildings including 
his mortuary temple at thebes the temple of abu simbel in nubia 
two obelisks in front of the temple at luxor his palace city at 
zoan in the delta and the temple at karnak with the largest columns 
in the world they measure roughly 11 feet in diameter 
architects still marvel at the precision of abu simbel where 
sunlight streams 160 feet into the temple on certain days to 
illuminate an inner chamber 
ramses reported to have sired 90 children waged a long and 
successful battle against the hittites of palestine and is believed 
by some biblical scholars to be the pharaoh of the book of exodus 
like his prodigious family and his mammoth projects tales of 
his life ring on a grand scale ancient records say ramses claimed 
his birth was signaled by the emergence of the star sirius on the 
same day as egyptians began their religious and civil new years a 
convergence which occurs once every 1461 years 
he ruled from 12791213 bc no one is quite sure when he was 
born but he was in his 80s when he died ramses i his grandfather 
who founded the 19th dynasty after akhnaton and tutankhamen ruled 
for one year seti i ramses father waged war against libyans and 
hittites and extended the boundaries of the egyptian empire ramses 
continued war against the hittites an ancient people of asia 
minor and syria in palestine 
the battle of kadesh was one of the last battles with the 
hittites ramses ii later signed a peace treaty with the hittites 
although ramses mummy remains in cairo the boston exhibit will 
feature padihershef a 2500yearold mummy owned by massachusetts 
general hospital 
last month padihershef a stonecutter was transported from the 
hospital in a plastic bubble stretcher designed for victims of 
nuclear accidents 
jan crocker director of traveling exhibits at the museum said 
negotiations to bring the exhibit to boston were launched several 
years ago by museum director roger nichols who died in december 
after the ramses exhibit returns to egypt the colossus will 
remain in memphis tenn for six more months 
each city sponsoring the exhibit guarantees a minimum 400000 
payment to the egyptian government to help construct a new national 
museum

this town is our town a new community 
fashioned from an old america of front porches and back yard paths 
picket fences and brick streets good neighbors and easy 
sociability 
this town is also a different town those porches and fences are 
mandated and lawns artificial siding and attached garages are 
forbidden 
seaside pop 203 is a small resort with a big ambition to 
revive a style of civic intimacy out of fashion since america moved 
to the suburbs 
by bringing homes offices stores and play areas closer 
together seasides tight grid of streets paths and squares is 
designed to get people out of their cars and in touch 
if this sounds familiar it is 
the newest idea in planning is the 19th century town says 
architect andres duany whose firm designed seasides master plan 
and wrote its building code seaside is the only authentic 
american town to be built in the last 40 years 
its also one of the most celebrated the boston globes robert 
campbell part of the pack of critics designers and developers who 
have made the pilgrimage to the florida panhandle calls seaside 
perhaps the most important new piece of architecture in the 
country 
seaside has no enemies gloats duany its the old 
american way of doing things and he says that because the town 
plan and building code can be adjusted for any town its going 
to be the model for the new suburb 
at the moment however seaside is at least a decade from 
completion less than a third of its 300 planned houses have been 
built and the spaces set aside for a school church inn and 
meeting hall are empty the town square is a muddy lot because it 
has few yearround residents seaside is virtually deserted in 
winter 
although seaside is designed to limit dependence on the 
automobile there is little within walking distance besides a 
restaurant a snack bar a book store a boutique and a oneroom 
post office that houses the fiveshelf public library 
what has been built is charming the pastel wooden cottages 
range in style from neovictorian to plain old florida cracker but 
feel like parts of a whole the skyline is enlivened by towers 
widows walks and pitched roofs all encouraged by the code the 
landscaping indigenous sand and scrub is natural 
there are many nice details such as a trellisshaded chess 
board a gazebo in an intersection a balcony over the front door 
of the department of public works shed sandy footpaths offer 
shortcuts between back yards houses bear signs with residents 
names instead of numbers 
this is how robert davis dreamed it would be 
davis a 44yearold birmingham ala native had visited this 
area as a boy building castles in the white sand along the gulf of 
mexico 
in 1978 when he inherited 80 acres here davis wanted to build 
again but he was revolted by the cold condominium towers sprouting 
along the water 
he drove around the southeast visiting gracious old towns 
equipped with tape measure notebook and camera he recorded street 
widths building dimensions architectural types 
the result is seaside 
this is not an artistic endeavor says duany who 
accompanied davis on some of the trips what weve done has 
nothing to do with inspiration we know how to design because weve 
studied cities and towns that work 
american town planning and design traditions seem so dumb and 
simple marvels davis why would we ever have gotten away from 
them 
cheap cars cheap gas and cheap land allowed those who 
engineered the postworld war ii building boom to separate home 
market and workplace as never before 
lessons learned by previous generations such as the proper 
ratio of a streets width to the height of its buildings or how 
far an adult with a child will walk to a store seemed irrelevant 
duany complains that todays suburbanites must drive to buy a 
loaf of bread play tennis visit a friend even to walk the 
dog if they do step out front their wide meandering streets 
many without sidewalks afford an inhospitable meeting place 
as a result few residents stop to discuss the weather drink 
coffee gossip if people do not talk davis and duany believe 
culture cannot flourish 
in its master plan and building code seaside looks to a more 
amiable past it seeks not only to look like an old town but to 
work like one

like a traditional southern town seasides design includes 
commercial buildings with sidewalk arcades and offices and 
apartments on the upper floors onstreet parking but only one 
small parking lot and straight treelined boulevards that connect 
public places 
houses are required to have a front porch 16 feet from the 
street to encourage conversation between porch sitters and 
pedestrians each front yard must have a fence and it must be 
different from the others on the street garages must be in back 
out of sight 
the lines of fences and houses produce intimate visually 
stimulating streets that feel like outdoor rooms human beings 
are programmed to feel space duany says in the wrong kind of 
space you feel what am i doing here 
look at georgetown in washington dc people pay 
incredible prices for substandard plumbing small rooms and parking 
three blocks away just to live on a nice street 
when the weather is good seasides residents stroll around 
looking at new houses chatting and generally enjoying themselves 
motorists dont speed because the streets are narrow slightly 
bumpy lined with parked cars and filled with pedestrians 
you cant help but meet people says jim koronkiewicz an 
accountant from long island whose family vacations at seaside it 
brings out the best in you 
the ultimate evidence of seasides success is financial the 
cost of an typical 50by100foot lot has risen from 20000 six 
years ago to around 70000 today twice as much as a lot the same 
size elsewhere along the coast 
but seaside is not perfect in the heat of summer for instance 
most residents seem to prefer the comfort of an airconditioned 
living room to the more social climate on the porch 
and back yard cottages and upstairs apartments forbidden in 
most new communities but encouraged by seasides building code 
have become too expensive for the kinds of people supposed to live 
in them such as domestics and students 
this lack of a socioeconomic mix says duany is the one 
signal failure of seaside its a rich persons town 
that leads some to wonder if this seasonal affluent resort 
still more theory than reality is an appropriate model for the 
new american suburb 
duany and davis have no doubt that seaside or at least its 
master plan and building code can be transplanted even large 
communities should be broken down into small village clusters they 
say 
were preaching to developers and architects that the same 
elements that go into suburbs can be reformulated into fairly dense 
little towns davis says 
duany and his wife and partner elizabeth platerzyberk have 
fashioned a model ordinance designed to create a seasidelike 
traditional neighborhood district wherever it is adopted we 
just mail it out he says if you want to make an impact in 
this country you have to kick into mass production 
but americans seem to love the privacy and comfort of their cars 
and suburbs given what columbia university historian kenneth 
jackson calls a national distrust of urban life and communal 
living do they really want to get closer to each other 
after generations of increasing privatization americans are 
starved for public life davis insists when you step outside 
your house you want to see people its scary for our culture that 
weve stopped seeing each other on the street

for 20 years leon krier has talked 
architecture taught architecture delineated architecture 
designed architecture everything but built architecture 
i do not build because i am an architect he once wrote 
meaning he would not compromise his principles and build in a world 
being rendered uninhabitable by industrialization technology and 
modern architecture 
when his plan for a school in france came in 200 percent over 
budget krier gave up the commission rather than change his design 
but now this consummate purist is building a wood cottage for 
vacation time in this new florida panhandle resort 
he finally took a deep breath and plunged into the abyss 
says robert davis seasides developer im honored hes willing 
to make an exception for seaside 
seaside comes along at just the right moment krier a 
luxembourg native said in a telephone interview from his home in 
london theres nothing new like it 
as far as krier is concerned all the problems of architecture 
were solved before the industrial revolution modern architecture 
and technology have served mainly to ruin the worlds cities 
seaside on the other hand reflects his preference for small 
settlements human scale pedestrian activity and traditional 
buildings 
although krier has no track record his plans have been 
influential far beyond their unexecuted state for the way in which 
they have reestablished a lost vision of a romantic past 
according to architectural critic ada louise huxtable 
krier also is a bit of a gadfly at an architects conference 
three years ago krier pointedly questioned philip johnson dean of 
american architects about a skyscraper hed designed in boston 
the building johnson admitted was 2 million square feet of 
space that should not be in this part of boston implicitly 
acknowledging kriers purity he added i am a whore and i am 
paid very well for highrise buildings 
in return for helping to lay out seasides plan and design the 
town tower davis gave krier a building lot but he attached one 
condition krier had to build on it 
the threeroom cottage designed to resemble a classical temple 
should be ready this summer 
krier wants to see how it turns out before completing his design 
for the tower after years of designing on paper he joked i 
want to see how many mistakes ive made

maturing baby boomers are changing the rules for 
menswear as they look for clothes somewhere between jeans and 
tshirt and the pinstripe suit 
most of the younger guys who are working grew up on mtv and 
rock n roll said awardwinning designer bill robinson whose 
label is starting its third year 
this generation he says is breaking down barriers of how and 
where you wear things 
the experimentation is evident in clothes now being shown for 
fall soon to be sent to stores across the country 
the look includes round softer shoulders on sportcoats 
highwaisted sweaters meant to be tucked in mock turtlenecks to be 
worn under vests buttery antique leathers and suedes browns 
grays and blacks are popular but some designers are throwing in 
reds yellows and what one called vegetable colors 
i think men are ready to wear color said ronaldus shamask 
a relative newcomer to menswear whose minimalistic designs in such 
shades as mustard teal and wine have won acclaim men are 
becoming much more comfortable with experimenting 
the classic polo line by ralph lauren whos been designing 
menswear for more than 20 years is trying out american indian 
styles suede shirts and antique ski and expedition clothing 
even the business suit is loosening up said tom julian 
associate fashion director of the mens fashion association men 
are more aware of fashion today 
jack herschlag executive director of the national association 
of mens sportswear buyers says suits are appearing in a variety 
of silhouettes this fall and even the doublebreasted suit will 
attempt a comeback 
men are moving away from the investmentdressing era and into a 
stage of experimentation herschlag says 
he and others in the field attribute the development partly to 
the influence of movies and tv shows like thirtysomething and 
la law that feature smartly dressed young professionals 
business is helped when men see role models like bill cosby 
looking groovy on tv says robinson who describes his clothes 
as soupedup versions of american classics 
its not silly its not meant to make a statement insisted 
shamasks sales director harlan bratcher its more for people 
who are tired of playing games its more this is me 
thats not to say the new looks are for everyone 
those who are sticking with jeans should know that this fall 
marks the beginning of the postacidwashed era herschlag said 
the pendulum is swinging back to very very dark colors 
said julian 
and the conservative business suit is not dead yet 
therell always be a brooks brothers element in the society 
robinson said

rising consumer prices are contributing to worries in the 
financial markets that inflation is accelerating 
the government said wednesday that consumer prices jumped 05 
percent in march reflecting a record increase in clothing costs 
and higher food and gasoline prices that triggered the biggest 
inflation jump in 14 months 
analysts said the sharp increase in the labor departments 
consumer price index which translated into a 64 percent annual 
growth rate demonstrated that the weak dollar and unexpectedly 
strong consumer demand were threatening to ignite a new bout of 
spiraling costs 
they speculated those pressures soon would prompt the federal 
reserve to nudge interest rates higher 
the bond market a good indicator of inflation sentiment 
reacted negatively to the cpi report bond prices fell and the 
yield on the treasurys key 30year bond rose to 905 percent 
although prices later recovered somewhat 
stocks also fell wednesday pushing the dow jones industrial 
average down 1409 points to 198541 its third straight decline 
the financial markets first were jolted last week when an 
unexpectedly high us trade deficit for february sent the dollar 
plunging a government report that wholesale prices jumped in march 
intensified investor worries 
the reagan administration which is counting on the federal 
reserve to keep the economy growing through the november election 
contended wednesday that the inflation fears were overblown 
despite large increases for consumer and producer prices in 
march the smaller increases in prices in previous 
monthsindicate that inflation remains under control said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
some private economists disputed that view 
the cpi rise reflects an increasingly widespread inflationary 
environment said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the good news on inflation is over for this year and the question 
now really is how high will prices go 
the march cpi increase followed a modest 02 percent february 
rise and was the biggest monthly gain since a 07 percent increase 
in january 1987 
in another economic report the labor deparment said americans 
average weekly earnings after discounting for inflation fell 03 
percent in march the second consecutive monthly decline the 
changes left americans inflationadjusted earnings 12 percent

japans economy is riding one of its biggest booms 
of the past five years surprising many economists who just last 
year were predicting a recession 
economists say the boom fueled by low interest rates tax cuts 
and massive public spending will continue for at least two years 
further into the future they say annual growth in the gross 
national product likely will exceed the governments 375 percent 
forecast for the next five years 
the speed of japans recovery has surprised most commentators 
this is really a remarkable pace said rich jerran an economist 
for the kleinwort benson investment firm the domestic economy is 
roaring 
during the past 11 months manufacturing output shot up 14 
percent a figure that took twice as long to achieve during the 
boom years of the 1970s economists say 
government officials report that corporate profits rose 272 
percent during 1987 while household savings rose by 118 percent 
inflationadjusted consumer spending rose a near record 58 
percent in february alone second only to a 59 percent rise 
recorded in november 1975 
according to the investment firm merrill lynch sustaining the 
current economic pace over the rest of 1988 would mean gross 
national product growth of 5 percent corporate profit growth of 
about 18 percent and retail sales growth of 138 percent 
william p sterling senior economist for merrill lynch in 
tokyo said japans 1987 growth alone could keep the economic boom 
rolling for the rest of this year making it a fertile market for 
the united states and other nations wanting to boost their exports 
a drop in japanese exports because of the rising yen which 
makes japanese products more expensive overseas cooled the 
economy somewhat last year but exports affect only 17 percent of 
japans gnp sterling said 
the other 83 percent is not exports and that did very well 
he said 
sterling said the current boom is the best of the past four or 
five years although the officially projected gnp growth rate of 
375 percent is low compared to the 8 percent to 10 percent a year 
japan achieved during the 1960s and part of the 1970s 
just last may economists were saying japan was headed for an 
economic downturn with the yens rapid rise inflating prices for 
the nations exportdriven economy 
industrial production fell to its lowest rate in years and 
unemployment rose to a record 32 percent japans unemployment 
rate is artificially low because it counts as employed members of 
the armed forces and people who work more than one hour during the 
last week of the month 
there was a lot of pressure to stop the yen from going up in 
1986 jerran said japan achieved this by cutting interest rates 
fueling a domestic housing boom that contributed about onethird of 
the gnp growth 
jerran said the government also injected 48 billion into the 
economy through public works spending and tax cuts 
at a news conference on tuesday bank of japan governor satoshi 
sumita said he was pleased with the economys performance and said 
one of his biggest concerns is maintaining stability 
sumita said that without a sudden appreciation in the yen or a 
rapid rise in prices economic growth was unlikely to slow 
although the united states will benefit somewhat from japans 
prosperity sterling said the effect would not be that great 
although us exports rose by 558 percent last month from a year 
earlier exports to japan still accounted for less than 1 percent 
of gross national product 
the united states needs to export not only to japan but 
everywhere else to get out of the problems it is in now he said 
one downside to the japanese economy might be in housing starts 
and the relative prosperity japan has enjoyed for the past year 
things have been so good economists say there is bound to be a 
slowdown 
the cost of housing has reached the point where it takes eight 
years of a workers gross income to purchase a small condominium 
which costs about 500000 four years is considered normal in most 
other countries 
jerran also says there is a danger of the japanese economy 
overheating 
because of the rapid rise over the past year industry is 
running out of capacity and labor he said this raises the 
danger that prices will climb upwards 
in turn the bank of japan may decide to push interest rates 
higher possibly by this summer to help curb inflation he said

prospects for a banner year in mexicos 
crucial tourism industry may have been grounded by the bankruptcy 
of the governments aeromexico airline 
a federal judge declared aeromexico bankrupt on monday and 
ordered it into receivership leaving its more than 9200 workers 
jobless the airline already had canceled most of its flights 
because of a strike triggered by aeromexicos plans for a 
costcutting restructuring 
the disappearance of aeromexico will affect negatively the 
tourism sector and will hinder it from reaching the estimates of 
transportation of foreign visitors to the different national 
destinations tourism secretary antonio enriquez savignac told 
reporters tuesday night 
tourism vies with the maquiladora assembly plant industry 
in which foreign companies set up factories in mexico to take 
advantage of cheap labor as the nations no 2 source of 
foreign exchange after petroleum 
estimates had been that tourism would bring in as much as 24 
billion this year the highest since 1982 when the pesos drop in 
value against the dollar started a slide in tourism revenue 
aeromexico filed for bankruptcy after ground and technical 
workers went on strike april 12 in protest of management plans to 
reduce the fleet and route system to bring the moneylosing airline 
into the black 
enriquez savignac said aeromexico and mexicana the other 
staterun airline which is unaffected by the bankruptcy or strike 
carry 57 percent of the foreign tourists arriving by air 
aeromexico was the only carrier serving 15 mexican cities 
representatives of the aeromexico technicians and workers union 
which represents 7250 striking workers announced plans to seek a 
meeting with president miguel de la madrid 
we will ask the president for a restructuring of the 
company miguel angel mejorada the unions secretary for 
internal matters said in a phone interview 
he said the union still had not received formal notification of 
the judges bankruptcy decision which had been announced by the 
federal communications and transportation department 
the airlines 2000 pilots and cabin attendants have their own 
unions that did not support the strike which forced cancellation 
of all 223 daily flights to 42 domestic and international 
destinations 
the union has charged that the decision to seek bankruptcy was 
politically motivated and not made on economic grounds 
no plans have been announced for a replacement for aeromexico 
mexicana on tuesday started accepting aeromexico tickets for routes 
in which they operated with parallel service 
aeromexico started business in 1934 and has been owned by the 
government since 1957 mexicana has been controlled by the 
government since 1982

ivan f boeskys help in exposing other wall 
street felons is more significant than previously recognized and 
could spark new indictments by fall his lawyers have indicated in 
a request to cut the convicted speculators prison sentence 
in seeking to reduce the threeyear term lawyers leon silverman 
and robert mccaw also disclosed that federal officials physically 
protected boesky from a death threat before he began serving his 
sentence last month 
they also claim boesky has been tailed and harassed by others 
sometimes using telephoneequipped cars he has implicated in 
financial felonies 
mr boesky has been asked and has volunteered information 
about topics people relationships transactions and securities 
that were not the subject of presentence debriefing sessions 
the document states he has suggested new avenues of inquiry for 
government investigators 
the document filed with us district judge morris lasker last 
friday and made available by his office wednesday marked one of 
the clearest public indications yet that boeskys disclosures will 
mean a broad range of new indictments it also provided new insight 
on the extent of his cooperation 
boeskys lawyers did not suggest how much the sentence should be 
reduced they also asked lasker not to consider the request until 
about october claiming by then the extraordinary extent and 
value of mr boeskys cooperation will become even more evident 
than it was at sentencing or than it can be now 
john carroll an assistant us attorney handling the boesky 
case would not comment on the request or other aspects of the 
document but he said the government intended to file a written 
response with lasker by friday 
once wall streets bestknown speculator in stocks of companies 
targeted for possible takeovers boesky stunned the financial world 
in november 1986 when he paid the securities and exchange 
commission a record 100 million to settle charges he illegally 
used secret insider information to profit in securities deals he 
was banished from the securities business for life 
boesky has since cooperated in a massive federal probe that has 
resulted in four criminal charges in the united states seven in 
britain four guilty pleas and nine civil actions by the sec 
in return boesky was allowed to plead guilty to a single count 
of conspiracy to lie to the sec he was sentenced to three years in 
federal prison by lasker on dec 18 and began serving it march 23 
five days after sentencing boesky was back in debriefing 
sessions with federal prosecutors his lawyers said in the document 
filed with lasker in addition the document said he has attended 
more than a dozen other meetings since then with agents of the 
justice department internal revenue service and sec 
it also said the sessions covered new topics new 
transactions new relationships and new securities growing out of 
mr boeskys earlier cooperation and other governmental 
investigations 
boesky also helped investigators in analyzing hundreds of 
documents involved in its criminal and civil investigations the 
plea contended 
his lawyers said boesky cooperated despite a death threat from 
former friend and fellow speculator john mulheren who was arrested 
feb 18 with a loaded assault rifle two pistols and a shotgun 
after making death threats federal prosecutors have since said 
that boesky implicated mulheren in illegal conduct 
in a previously undisclosed detail his lawyers said federal 
officials took a number of public and private steps to protect 
mr boeskys safety 
they also said mulherens death threat came at a time when 
other subjects of the united states attorneys boeskyrelated 
investigations had mr boesky under physical surveillance 
they said those people who werent identified hired agents who 
watched mr boeskys movements from telephoneequipped cars 
followed him on the streets questioned other patrons at 
establishments he utilized and harassed him in various other ways

northwest airlines is putting another 
advertising agency in charge of creating commercials for its 
smokefree flights to relieve tobacco industry pressures on the 
agency that created the first ads for its program 
saatchi amp saatchi dfs compton a huge new yorkbased agency 
created the first ads for northwests nosmoking program and 
remains the airlines agency for other general advertising 
the commercials showed passengers applauding northwests plans 
to ban smoking on nearly all its domestic flights 
shortly after the ads started airing last month saatchi was 
fired from its longtime job making cookie and candy ads for rjr 
nabisco inc which also makes cigarettes 
northwest said wednesday it was moving the nosmoking program 
assignment to the kolesar and hartwell agency based in 
minneapolis the agency already handles northwests ads in media 
aimed at the travel trade 
the job involves about 2 million of the estimated 50 million 
in northwest billings handled by saatchi 
rjr had cited philosophical differences for pulling its 
cookie and candy assignments from saatchi but those familiar with 
the decision said privately that rjr executives were troubled 
saatchi had created the nosmoking ads and failed to tell them 
about it 
we are extremely disappointed that a reactionary faction of 
the tobacco industry continues to put literally dozens of saatchi amp 
saatchi professional careers in jeopardy ab magary executive 
vice president for marketing for northwest airlines said in 
explaining why it moved the nosmoking assignment to another agency 
he said that while the st paul minnbased airline was happy 
with saatchis work it wanted to make sure that saatchi can 
continue to serve us with total objectivity and enthusiasm 
magary declined in an interview to be more specific about what 
pressures saatchi was under from the tobacco industry but said the 
airline had been told the agency continued to feel pressured 
magary said northwest offered to reassign the nosmoking job to 
another agency in hopes of solving their problem and they 
accepted our offer to do it 
he said it was up to the agency to elaborate on whatever 
pressures they feel they continue to be under 
but agency spokesmen declined the opportunity to do so 
we understand northwests decision with regard to the 
nosmoking assignment said michael keeshan executive vice 
president and management director in charge of the northwest 
account at saatchi 
but he declined to say whether saatchi supported or solicited 
the action adding only that we are anxious to put this matter 
behind us 
saatchi also is the advertising agency for lorillard incs true 
cigarettes 
sara r ridgway a spokeswoman for lorillard said the cigarette 
company was not putting any pressure on saatchi in the wake of the 
northwest nosmoking ads she said lorillard was happy with 
saatchis work and planned to retain its relationship with the 
agency

newly elected chairman robert e allen says 
american telephone amp telegraph co has a new sense of urgency 
and is committed to sustaining its strong firstquarter profit 
increases 
no officer of atampt is feeling content and complacent allen 
told shareholders wednesday at the companys annual meeting 
allen 53 was elevated to chairman and chief executive by the 
board of directors late tuesday a day after the death from colon 
cancer of his 62yearold predecessor james e olson 
also on wednesday atampt announced a 106 percent increase in its 
first quarter earnings its earnings per share rose 15 percent 
because of a redemption of preferred shares that lessened the 
amount that had to be skimmed off for preferred dividends 
asked at a news conference whether atampt could keep up the 15 
percent growth in earnings per share for the rest of 1988 allen 
said thats our firm commitment 
at the meeting shareholders rejected a white supremacist 
groups resolution that sought to phase out atampts affirmative 
action but also rejected a proposal to expand affirmative action 
allen who was president and chief operating officer is a 
thoughtful softspoken contrast to the forceful olson but the two 
men were close and olson had groomed him as a successor 
this is a bittersweet moment for me allen told shareholders 
with a slight quaver in his voice i sincerely wish it were under 
different circumstances 
allen tackled questions about whether he had the steel to 
continue olsons legacy he said he was proud of his style of 
developing trusting relations with colleagues 
first and foremost im a team player allen told reporters 
atampt said its profit rose to 492 million or 46 cents a share 
from 445 million or 40 cents a share a year earlier revenue 
rose 28 percent to 835 billion from 812 billion 
atampts earnings statement indicated continuing difficulties in 
selling computers and office equipment revenue was flat in the 
category of data products network equipment and business 
communications products 
in contrast revenue from services mainly longdistance was up 
82 percent 
while noting that atampt had done a good job of cutting costs 
allen said the company must work harder on increasing sales 
no business can live by cost control alone it must grow he 
told reporters 
rawleigh warner the retired chief of mobil corp and an atampt 
director told shareholders that olson spoke with him by phone two 
weeks ago and said that should anything happen to him bob allen 
was his natural successor 
allen had served as president and chief operating officer since 
1986 before that he had held top finance jobs in the company and 
had a long career in the bell telephone companies 
the resolution against affirmative action was sponsored by the 
national alliance a white supremacist organization based in 
arlington va herbert poinsett of norcross ga spoke on its 
behalf contending that blacks are less intelligent and affirmative 
action hurts the morale of whites 
the resolution earned votes of 86 percent of the shares 
allen said atampt considered the proposal highly objectionable 
and tried three times to get the securities and exchange commission 
to keep it off the ballot 
the resolution calling for more affirmative action was 
introduced by alex s tillman a black manager at bell laboratories 
in murray hill nj he said taking better advantage of the talents 
of minorities and women made good business sense for atampt 
it earned votes of 6 percent of the shares

atampt says a white supremacist group hurt employee 
morale with its proposal to phase out affirmative action even 
though the proposal fell far short of victory 
the resolution by the national alliance which contended that 
minorities were intellectually inferior to whites drew 86 
percent of shares voted at wednesdays annual meeting of 
shareholders of american telephone amp telegraph co 
it might have won fewer votes if shareholders had realized the 
negative impact it had on the morale of the companys family of 
employees said hal burlingame atampts senior vice president for 
human resources 
an opposing resolution to increase affirmative action proposed 
by alex tillman a black manager at bell laboratories won just 6 
percent of the shares voted 
some saw the voting as almost a referendum on affirmative action 
because atampt is the most widelyheld stock in the united states 
with 27 million shareholders 
tension was high in denvers cavernous currigan exhibition hall 
as herbert poinsett of norcross ga argued in favor of the 
proposal by the arlington vabased national alliance 
more than a dozen shareholders spoke against the national 
alliance proposal including a denver man harry methner who said 
he fought nazi youth in gang wars on the streets of berlin in 1935 
when nazis used similar arguments of genetic inferiority against 
jews 
no one spoke in favor except poinsett who is the host of a 
white supremacist show race and reason on an atlanta public 
access television channel 
tillman choked with emotion said he feared that the wide 
circulation given to the national alliances ideas would poison the 
atmosphere at atampt 
these kind of comments hang in the air a long time tillman 
said 
tillmans resolution said the shortage of minorities and women 
in high ranks could hurt atampt in its dealings with cities with 
female or minority mayors and in dealings with foreign cultures 
because both resolutions received more than 3 percent support 
their sponsors are entitled to try putting them on the ballot again 
next year 
robert e allen atampts new chairman and chief executive said 
the company would try to keep the national alliance proposal off 
next years ballot he said the company tried and failed three 
times to have the securities and exchange commission keep it off 
the ballot this year 
we find the intent and the wording of this proposal highly 
objectionable allen said 
the communication workers of america atampts biggest union held 
a rally against racism outside the meeting 
in a statement from washington cwa president morton bahr said 
the union was pleased that the national alliance resolution was 
so resoundingly defeated

a plan to clean up the states troubled savings 
and loan institutions has gotten an overwhelming response from 
thrifts ready to participate according to a spokesman for federal 
regulators 
the federal home loan bank in dallas said wednesday it would 
announce later this month the first consolidations in the southwest 
plan for texas thrifts 
the fhlb announced the program in february and requested 
proposals from interested parties by march 31 
we have received about 150 proposals from parties interested 
in participating in the southwest plan said david colgren fhlb 
spokesman in dallas this is an overwhelming response of parties 
interested in the plan 
of 279 texas thrifts 104 were insolvent as of sept 30 1987 
according to the fhlb those endangered institutions will be 
consolidated closed or sold said colgren 
m danny wall fhlb chairman has said that roughly half the 
problems of the nations thrift industry are in texas which has 
been hit hard by an energy and real estate slump in recent years 
investors would provide up to 1 billion in capital for the 
plan much of the expense will be paid by the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp which was expected to provide 7 billion at 
first and up to 2 billion annually 
we believe overall we need a fair and equitable analysis for 
each proposal colgren said that analysis must balance the 
interests of fslic and private investors we anticipate the first 
consolidations to be available in late april 
colgren would not say how many sampls would be involved in the 
first announcement but added that a geometric progression of 
consolidations would be made thereafter 
industry officials had said earlier that the states thrift 
crisis increases with every delay along with the cost of remedies 
but colgren said we will not rush into any deal that is bad 
for fslic and bad for the industry we do not want to create more 
problems otherwise todays solutions become tomorrows problems 
on monday fhlb officials reported that the fslics insurance 
fund shortfall almost doubled in 1987 to an estimated 116 billion 
we anticipate the southwest plan to cost fslic somewhere 
between 6 and 7 billion said colgren through fslic 
recapitalization signed by the president in august of last year we 
will raise 108 billion over the next three years 
through fslic notes and other sources we anticipate having 
about 20 billion to work with he said 
insolvent texas thrifts will have lost at least 895 million in 
operating expenses in the first four months of this year according 
to one analysis 
we believe through consolidation of the industry through the 
southwest plan interest from private investors reducing the cost 
of funds that texas institutions must pay to attract deposits the 
texas premium and using fslic sources we can solve the 
problems in texas colgren said

the united auto workers would 
consider chrysler corps bid to adopt corporatewide 
japanesestyle production methods if its executives accept a less 
lucrative japanesestyle pay system a union official says 
workers and union officials joined uaw vice president marc stepp 
on wednesday in sharply criticizing the multimilliondollar wages 
received by top chrysler executives particularly chairman lee 
iacocca as the union and no 3 automaker continued talks over a 
new labor contract 
what were wanting is whats fair and equitable for all of our 
members in relation to the standing of the corporation said 
thomas jackie russell president of uaw local 1413 in huntsville 
ala when we hear the type money these guys are making then that 
indicates the standings of the corporation 
negotiations entered their fourth day today over a contract to 
replace the one expiring sept 14 the pact would cover 66000 
active and laid off workers in 15 states and 65000 retirees 
stepp the unions chief negotiator targeted iacocca the day 
after chrysler disclosed the chairman received 179 million in 
1987 in salary cash and stock bonuses and money earned exercising 
stock options 
iacocca in 1987 was the highestpaid auto company executive for 
a second straight year in 1986 when he earned 206 million 
iacocca also was the nations highestpaid executive 
executive compensations have gotten completely out of hand 
stepp said it makes it extremely difficult for us to sit down in 
a rational manner and try to negotiate a decent contract 
word of iacoccas pay prompted calls from workers demanding that 
union officials seek higher pay or other benefits in their 
contract stepp said 
under the japanese system cited by stepp managers earn six to 
eight times more than workers american managers earn about 18 
times more and in iacoccas case 27 times more stepp said 
chrysler workers earn 1443 an hour including costofliving 
adjustments or gross base pay of about 30000 
stepp also said that before japanese workers are laid off or 
their pay is cut japanese managers take a pay cut 
stepp raised the pay comparisons a day after anthony st john 
chryslers chief negotiator said the automaker has asked union 
leaders to support its efforts to adopt socalled modern operating 
agreements at all plants russells local 1413 is one of six plants 
where moas are in effect 
the japanesestyle moa production system organizes workers into 
teams uses them in a variety of jobs instead of a single defined 
task and reduces the number of workers needed to cover for 
absentees inspect products and correct mistakes 
st john also asked for a committee comprising union company 
and outside representatives to study the effectiveness of job 
security provisions in the new contract the committee also would 
look at ways to increase productivity and improve quality another 
weapon in the push for moa adoption 
stepp said the union would consider that proposal if the 
committee also could study and adjust top executives compensation 
to bring it into line with the japanese managerstoworkers pay 
ratio 
we think it is only fair that since they ask us to go to a 
japanese production system such as moas and team conceptit is 
fair for them to go to the japanese system in terms of 
compensation stepp said

general motors corp plans to expand a program 
aimed at improving the health and fitness of workers especially 
those who suffer from obesity high blood pressure mental stress 
or substance abuse 
its already in place in some areas right now it will be 
intensified in july said dr george mackey gms health director 
gm and the united auto workers union will run the program which 
will cover roughly 450000 workers in the united states mackey 
said wednesday 
the no 1 automaker decided to push the program after reviewing 
the results of pilot projects that began in 1985 at four auto 
plants mackey said the plants were in warren pontiac and livonia 
screening and counseling could cost up to 24 million if all 
employees participate says jack erfurt a researcher for the 
institute of labor and industrial relations at the university of 
michigan 
gms potential savings however could be much greater erfurt 
estimates 80 percent of gms workers suffer some type of health 
problem 
the first step will involve blood pressure checks and a review 
of each employees medical history employees can either enter 
classes for fitness losing weight or stoping smoking adopt 
selfhelp programs or choose oneonone counseling 
six months later health care workers will contact employees to 
check progress 
in the pilot program gm paid the entire cost of initial 
screening and twothirds of the followup programs with employees 
paying the remainder gms share amounted to roughly 53 per worker 
each year erfurt said 
the results of gms pilot project were mixed in two plants 
less than 10 percent of the workers entered the health classes he 
said 
in the other two factories nearly half the employees did so 
but those workers could choose among selfhelp programs counseling 
or fullscale classes unlike employees in the other two plants 
gm has supported various health programs for years mostly on a 
plantbyplant basis but this one is broader and more ambitious 
erfurt said

hundreds of shareholders turned out for 
gillette cos annual meeting today where the consumer products 
giant squared off against coniston group in a highly visible 
takeover battle 
the two companies waged a proxy war at the meeting held at 
gillettes manufacturing center in this town 20 miles north of 
boston 
coniston sought four seats on gillettes board of directors but 
gillette hoped a coalition of loyal shareholders and lastminute 
support from large institutions would render enough votes to repel 
the new york group 
results of the election are expected later this month 
since coniston went public feb 11 with plans to seek control of 
gillette the two rivals have traded barbs in the press and the 
courts 
conistons board candidates have pledged to support the 
divestiture of the worldwide empire gillette built around personal 
care products in an effort to increase profitability and boost the 
companys stock price 
coniston contends gillette is still mired by the nearly 580 
million paid to revlon group inc in 1986 to abandon its repeated 
takeover attempts 
gillette however has pointed out to its nearly 27000 
shareholders a steady rise in earnings since the company laid off 
2400 workers and the sale of several unprofitable divisions after 
signing a 10year notakeover pact with revlon in 1986 
last week gillette said it might close some north american 
plants to further streamline operations 
the takeover contest will likely be decided by institutional 
investors which own between 60 percent to 65 percent of the 1155 
million gillette shares outstanding 
coniston which has run newspapers ads attacking gillettes 
greenmail payment to revlon claims to have the support of 
several major shareholders including two california pension plans 
with about 21 million shares and a new york state retirement plan 
with nearly 2 million shares 
gillette proxy solicitor john wilcox declined to name 
supporters but he suggested many large shareholders will wait 
until the last moment to make a decision 
gillette spokesman david fausch said that since the coniston bid 
does not seek a complete change in control some large shareholders 
may be willing to take a risk for greater profits 
they look at the shortterm gains said fausch this is 
only four people on a 12member board saying theyll push for a 
sale its not a complete switch in management

in the 1800s the story goes immigrants coming 
to america believed the streets were paved with gold nowadays it 
is foreign retailers who are arriving on these shores in search of 
their fortunes 
they are lured by the size of the us market and the american 
passion for foreign styles and goods several are already reporting 
success 
we could get a large slice of the apple by selling in 
america said sophie mirman who helped introduce the sock shop a 
chain of british hosiery stores to this country 
the most prominent of the new arrivals is campeau corp the 
canadian concern bought out allied stores corp in 1986 and is in 
the process of taking over federated department stores inc 
to help finance its purchase of federated campeau is selling 
allieds brooks brothers chain to another foreign retailer marks 
and spencer plc of britain 
meanwhile the australian developer hooker corp moved into 
retailing with the purchase last year of the bonwit teller b 
altman and sakowitz chains 
buying an american company is not the only way to get here some 
smaller companies are striking out on their own sock shop is among 
them so are fil a fil la sweaterie and tricots caroll apparel 
retailers from france 
a foreign presence in the us retailing industry is nothing 
new in 1973 batus inc the us arm of britains bat industries 
plc swept in with the purchase of saks fifth avenue and the 
nowclosed gimbels chain 
and the fashionable streets of cities like new york washington 
palm beach and los angeles have been graced for years by names such 
as gucci courreges and yves st laurent 
but what is different about many of these latest arrivals is 
they are appealing to a larger and different market segment many 
offer moderatelypriced merchandise giving more consumers a chance 
to buy and wear clothes with foreign labels 
with such prices the new transplants have enormous 
development potential in this market said charles aug whose 
company garrickaug associates store leasing inc scouts foreign 
retailers and helps them set up shop here 
many of the retailers are drawn to the united states in hopes of 
equaling the success of the italian retailer benetton aug said 
benetton has grown to 760 stores in the united states out of 
more than 4500 worldwide since the first us store with its 
nowfamiliar bright green sign opened in manhattan in 1979 said 
sally fischer a spokeswoman for the italian retailer 
said aug the rapid growth of benetton generated the interest 
of the other european merchants to come over here and start 
moving 
benetton stores are operated under licensing agreements with the 
italian company the stores sell only benetton fashions and buy 
the clothes from benetton ms fischer said 
other retailers break into the us market through franchises 
in which they can profit from an american operation without having 
the expense and problems of opening and managing stores 
printemps a denver fashion retailer is a franchisee of au 
printemps a french department store chain the us store which 
opened in november operates autonomously of its namesake but 
turns over to au printemps a percentage of its sales said frank 
ball president of the american company 
the denver store sells french fashions but is americanized 
for practicality said ball weve used the name but the 
denver store is not a reflection of the store in france 
some retailers own their us outlets sock shop opened three 
stores in manhattan in december and were delighted with the way 
theyre going said ms mirman chairman of the company 
because of its size the united states was one of several 
markets sock shop wanted to explore ms mirman said the company 
hopes to open nine more outlets this year and eventually expand 
beyond new york 
the retailers generally get some assistance from american 
advisers or brokers before setting up shop ms mirman said sock 
shops entry into the united states was facilitated by a minority 
stockholder who lived in new york la sweaterie was brought into 
the american market through a joint venture with david genser the 
companys president here 
unlike many other foreign retailers la sweaterie did not try 
new york first opening instead in the boston area where genser 
lives the retailer now has 29 stores in the united states 
including several in california 
the weakness of the dollar since 1985 has helped some 
foreigners aug said explaining installation costs would be a 
fraction of what it would have cost them a few years ago 
but the lower dollar can be a doubleedged sword 
its cheaper to set up shop but thats offset by the fact 
that the market for goods at these price points does not grow 
when the dollar is buying less said max garelick president of 
rodier usa the american arm of the french clothing chain rodier 
genser agreed it has hurt us he said of the dollars 
decline all of our clothes are made in france and become more 
expensive as the us currency slides 
one way to fight the impact of currency fluctuations is to 
become a more american company benetton has started manufacturing 
some of its merchandise in rocky mount nc ms fischer said 
but the style will remain something thats italian and french 
what european companies have to offer she said

result thats what id be here for trump said 
the bridge was closed last week when city transportation 
officials found cracks in its beams an inspection is under way to 
determine the extent of the damage and officials have said the 
bridge will be closed at least three weeks 
alfred a dellibovi head of the federal urban mass 
transportation administration had invited trump to examine the 
bridge and joined him for todays tour 
in a letter to trump dellibovi lauded him as a builder whose 
projects come in on time under budget and built to last 
in 1987 trump showed up the city bureaucracy when he took over 
repair of the skating rink and finished the job in five months and 
under budget the city had spent 7 years and 12 million on what 
was supposed to take 2 years and 45 million

the european economic community 
recommended that its 12 member governments authorize individuals to 
make their own electricity and buy up all excess energy from 
private sources 
the eecs executive commission said thursday that private 
production of electricity is being discouraged or even banned 
throughout the trading bloc by legislation that presents 
insurmountable obstacles to selfgeneration of electricity by 
users 
the commission in a formal recommendation said the member 
governments should allow selfproduction and obligate utility 
companies to buy surplus energy at fair prices 
such a system it said would help stimulate the development of 
alternative sources of energy and lead to better use of available 
resources

hughes electronics corp and electronic data systems corp but

the huge production of american farmers 
developed at first from a land mass that seemed limitless to early 
settlers until about 1950 when more food was needed larger crops 
were planted 
but from that point on farmers relied on boosting the 
productivity of their land to get more bushels from fewer acres 
says lester r brown president of worldwatch institute a private 
nonprofit research organization based in washington dc 
and to do that he said farmers rapidly became hooked on oil 
the fossilbased energy that provides fuel for tractors and 
irrigation pumps the fossil fuels which include natural gas also 
became a giant provider of chemical fertilizers used to boost 
peracre yields 
the basic problem says brown in world watch magazine is that 
where once there were lakes of oil beneath the surface of america 
there are now only puddles 
in north america which produces nearly onefifth of the 
worlds grain 80 percent of the oil discovered to date already has 
been burned he said current proven reserves in the united 
states total 36 billion barrels enough to supply domestic needs 
for less than nine years at current rates of use 
the problem is not confined to the united states the third 
world countries which have rising food demands no oil reserves and 
limited funds for expanding imports could be headed for traumatic 
times 
the indian subcontinent which has nearly a billion people to 
feed and according to world bank projections another billion on 
the way before population growth stops has less than 1 percent of 
the worlds oil reserves 
china which also has a billion people is expected to show only 
modest population growth and is in somewhat better shape but it 
has only 3 percent of the global oil reserves 
the middle east with reserves of 398 billion barrels lies at 
the other end of spectrum brown said it has 56 percent of the 
worlds oil reserves and only 4 percent of the people moreover 
the middle easts share of the remaining world oil reserves is 
rising as reserves outside the region are rapidly depleted 
brown said that while opec the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries has had difficulties agreeing on production 
strategy the growing middle east control of the worlds oil is 
setting the stage for prices to rise in the nottoodistant 
future 
he added with petroleum reserves concentrated in one region 
and with food production becoming more oildependent food security 
and access to oil are becoming closely entwined issues 
brown noted that as the 20th century began the worlds farmers 
were almost entirely energy selfsufficient the sun provided 
energy for crops to grow livestock provided fertilizer and animal 
power for tillage farmers supplied labor for planting and 
harvesting 
today on the average the worlds farmers use the equivalent of 
more than a barrel of oil to produce a ton of grain each year he 
said it takes more 
since 1950 agricultures use of fossil fuels has multiplied 
sixfold brown said between 1950 and 1985 the farm tractor 
fleet quadrupled world irrigated area tripled and fertilizer use 
increased ninefold 
despite agricultures heavy reliance on oil its share of world 
oil use remains small so a shortage of oil for food production is 
not of immediate concern he said 
the economics of food production are however increasingly 
shaped by the price of oil brown said moreover in contrast 
to some other important oilusing activities such as electricity 
generation which is reducing its dependence on oil agricultures 
reliance on oil is rising making it more vulnerable to future 
price increases 
some observations 
draft animals are still used extensively for tillage in africa 
and asia but the real workhorses of modern agriculture are 
tractors as much as twothirds of the worlds cropland may now be 
plowed with tractors the global tractor fleet has increased from 
fewer than 6 million in 1950 to 24 million today 
world use of chemical fertilizers soared from 14 million to 131 
million tons between 1950 and 186 as cropland area per person 
declined fertilizer use per person increased this increase was 
largely reponsible for world grain production climbing to 166 
billion metric tons from 624 million during the same period 
however in some agriculturally advanced countries fertilizer 
use is leveling off in the united states for example fertilizer 
use peaked in 1981 and then dropped as land prices and the farm 
economy weakened 
irrigation today ranks third behind tractors and fertilizer as 
an energy user in 1900 world irrigation encompassed an estimated 
100 million acres by 1950 it grew to 230 million acres today 
the irrigated area is about 670 million acres and has contributed 
greatly to record advances in global food production that includes 
the use of both surface water and underground sources which 
require energyintensive pumping to get it to crops 
the worldwide production of oil and grain has moved in 
opposite directions since 1978 both moved steadily upward from 
1950 to 1978 but since then oil production has fallen while grain 
output has continued to go up brown said 
more importantly he added the demand for grain is 
projected to rise until at least the middle of the next century 
while oil production is projected to decline over the same period 
brown said the challenge to the worlds agricultural scientists 
is to devise less energy intensive methods of expanding world food 
output recent moves by american farmers to minimum till and 
notill crop production is a step in that direction he said 
another move has been brazils use of more tractors using 
ethanol or fuel alcohol made from sugarcane 
agriculture cannot expand its use of petroleum indefinitely in 
a world where oil production is falling brown said

billionaire couple harry and leona helmsley in 
a repeat of last weeks state court appearance pleaded innocent 
today to federal charges stemming from an alleged 4 million tax 
scam 
their pleas of not guilty the only words they spoke during 
arraignment in us district court were followed by a date with 
federal marshals for fingerprinting and mug shots 
the 79yearold helmsley and his wife whose combined estimated 
net worth of 14 billion makes them among the worlds richest 
couples sat in court with several defendants in the pizza 
connection ii heroin smuggling trial 
at the governments recommendation the helmsleys were released 
without bail but must surrender their passports pending trial the 
same applied to two former helmsley employees who are codefendants 
and also pleaded innocent 
the couples lawyers have charged that the wealth and prominence 
of the helmsleys who have vast commercial real estate holdings 
including a string of hotels was a factor in their indictment 
the fact that the prosecutors themselves have stated that 
their investigations were triggered by articles in a new york 
newspaper has led many to conclude that both the state and the 
federal indictment are motivated by the prominence of the 
helmsleys lawyers stephen e kaufman and gerald a feffer said 
in a statement 
the federal charges a 47count indictment that accuses the 
helmsleys of improperly claiming 4 million in deductions are part 
of an unfair and groundless attack the lawyers said 
the indictment alleges that the couple masked expenditures for 
home renovations and other personal purchases as business expenses 
the attorneys accused prosecutors of leaks involving the case 
singling out the helmsleys due to their high profiles and basing 
state and federal charges on false allegations 
us attorney rudolph giuliani and state attorney general robert 
abrams last week announced twin indictments for tax fraud against 
helmsley and his wife the selfproclaimed hotel queen 
the couple was named with two helmsley employees in a 188count 
state indictment and the federal indictment for masking the 
renovations and several purchases as business expenses 
they pleaded innocent april 14 in state court after they were 
booked and fingerprinted the federal indictment additionally 
charges mrs helmsley 67 and frank turco 45 of lutz fla with 
attempted extortion of helmsley employees and contractors 
in addition to turco former helmsley financial manager joseph 
licari 51 of oyster bay cove was named in both indictments

soybean futures prices closed sharply lower 
thursday on the chicago board of trade as rain dampened the dry 
fields of the western corn belt and the south american soybean 
harvest accelerated grains also closed lower 
rain in western iowa and nebraska where spring planting has 
just begun melted fears that dry conditions would delay 
germination of seeds analysts said 
soybean prices came under additional pressure from the brazilian 
soybean harvest now more than 50 percent complete and the 
beginning of the argentine soybean harvest said richard loewy 
senior grain and oilseed analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
they should be 80 to 85 percent finished in may he said of 
the south american harvest then our crush and export rate will 
tail off and you dont get as much domestic meal feeding anyway as 
we get into the warmer weather 
further pressure on the soy complex came from an american 
soybean association statement that it did not expect the 
agriculture department to offer the soviet union 170 thousand 
metric tons of us soybean oil under its export enhancement 
program loewy said 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents lower with the

aboard thousands of airline flights the 
smoking lamp is about to be extinguished 
the federal ban on cigarette smoking on domestic flights of two 
hours or less about 80 percent of the total takes effect at 
1201 am saturday beforehand some avid smokers are 
reconsidering train travel while others search for ways to keep 
their tobacco urges under control at least for a few hours 
government and airline industry officials said thursday they 
expect the new smoking restrictions to cause few problems although 
some confusion may exist for the first few days 
on the whole i think were in reasonably good shape on this 
said transportation secretary jim burnley whose departmentissued 
the new restrictions earlier this month in compliance with a law 
enacted by congress last year 
the transportation department and the federal aviation 
administration have come under some criticism however for not 
pushing the airlines hard enough to publicize details of the new 
restrictions and avoid passenger confusion 
the airlines do not have a uniform policy to inform the 
public about the new rules said susan bianchisand president of 
the 21000member association of flight attendants 
she said at least one airline inserted details about the new 
requirements into flight crew manuals only this week and four 
airlines are continuing to book seats in smoking sections of 
nosmoking flights 
the airlines said they hope a series of announcements to 
passengers both before and after boarding a flight will limit 
the confusion and perhaps head off any disturbances industry 
spokesmen noted that a smoking ban on flights within in california 
has been largely accepted since it went into effect at the first of 
the year 
an estimated 13600 domestic flights a day will be affected by 
the nosmoking edict international flights are not affected and 
the length of a flight will be determined by the time shown in the 
airlines official schedule 
even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes 
beyond two hours smoking will be prohibited if the schedule has it 
as lasting two hours or less faa officials said 
the government has defined a flight as being any single segment 
between two cities thus for example a traveler flying from 
washington dc to los angeles with a stop in st louis would not 
be able to smoke on the first leg of the flight but would be 
allowed to do so on the second longer leg 
one major carrier northwest airlines is prohibiting smoking on 
all its flights within the continental united states but so far no 
other airline has followed suit 
we dont think our customers want us to become a nonsmoking 
airline if they tell us to do so we will robert crandall 
chairman of american airlines and himself a heavy smoker said 
recently 
the battle over whether airline passengers should be allowed to 
smoke has been raging for nearly two decades and forces on both 
sides of the issue say the fight is far from over despite the new 
restrictions 
antismoking groups promise to push for a total ban on smoking 
aboard airliners while the tobacco industry and many of its most 
loyal customers are gearing up to have the limited smoking 
prohibitions reversed in congress 
the legislation enacted last year calls for the issue to 
reexamined in two years 
believe me were working full speed ahead and so is the 
tobacco industry says ahron leightman president of citizens 
against tobacco smoke this is halftime in a football game were 
up 60 and during halftime the forces are regrouping 
we remain very opposed to the twohour ban said brennan 
moran a spokeswoman for the industry trade group the tobacco 
institute 
twothirds of airline passengers favor a smoking ban on 
airlines according to a study at the university of missouri 
officials at northwest airlines said they instituted their ban on 
all flights after a survey showed only one in 10 passengers wanted 
to sit in the smoking section 
neverthelss some heavy smokers may find the adjustment 
difficult said dr donald powell executive director of the 
american institute for preventive medicine which has worked with 
hospitals and corporations to help people deal with stress 
management including smoking problems 
certainly when people fly theres a sense of loss of control 
when we feel lack of control we feel stress so the urges of a 
smoker to smoke are more pronounced among people when they fly 
powell said 
he suggested a few tips to battle the nosmoking pangs 
stay away from alcohol because it increases the desire to 
smoke also avoid coffee or soft drinks containing caffeine 
close the ashtrays near your seat to eliminate the smell of 
tobacco that is likely to linger 
walk in the cabin when the smoking urge become acute 
keep your mind and hands busy by reading working a crossword 
puzzle or playign with a deck of cards 
when the urge peaks take a deep breath hold the air for 3 
seconds and slowely exhale 
place a rubber band around the wrist our your smoking arm and 
when the urge hits give yourself a little zap 
were trying to keep people from climbing the cabin walls 
said powell

evidence presented in newarks closely 
watched cigarette trial indicates tobacco companies conspired 
to hide the dangers of smoking and the jury trial should continue 
a federal judge declared today 
at the same time however judge h lee sarokin dismissed a 
claim that the three companies sued in the liability case liggett 
group inc philip morris inc and lorillard inc caused rose 
cipollones lung cancer by not marketing a safer cigarette 
attorneys for mrs cipollone argued that the companies knew they 
could develop a safer cigarette that had less potential of causing 
cancer mrs cipollone 64 of lakehurst died in 1984 after 40 
years of smoking 
but the judge said the attorneys for mrs cipollones estate 
carrying on a lawsuit filed before she died had not presented 
evidence to support that claim 
nevertheless sarokin of us district court said the jury 
trial will continue over whether the three manufacturers conspired 
to misrepresent and conceal facts regarding the dangers of smoking 
he also said mrs cipollones estate could continue seeking 
punitive damages 
sarokin said that the evidence indicates that the cigarette 
industry entered into a sophisticated conspiracy 
the conspiracy was organized to refute undermine and 
neutralize information coming from the scientific and medical 
community and at the same time to confuse and mislead the 
consuming public in an effort to encourage existing smokers to 
continue and new persons to commence smoking the judge said 
sarokin also said a jury might reasonably conclude that 
the defendants in particular and the industry in general 
intentionally and willfully ignored the known health consequences 
to consumers from the sale of their products 
the evidence presented also permits the jury to find the 
tobacco industry conspiracy vast in its scope devious in its 
purpose and devastating in its results the judge said 
but sarokin dismissed claims that philip morris and lorillard 
failed to warn mrs cipollone of the dangers of cigarettes 
the judge said mrs cipollone did not start smoking cigarettes 
manufactured by those two companies until she was a veteran smoker 
and the companies had no duty to warn her about any dangers until 
she became a consumer of their products 
similar claims against liggett however were allowed to 
continue 
the trial which began feb 1 is viewed by both the industry 
and smoking opponents as critical in the tobacco companies efforts 
to defend against future liability cases

the dollar moved narrowly higher against most 
major currencies thursday in uneventful trading 
gold prices fell republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid of 45465 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt down from 
456 late wednesday 
traders said the dollar remained in a narrow range throughout 
the session and volume was light 
its the same pattern weve seen the last couple of days 
said james mcgroarty a vice president at discount corp 
he noted that the dollar continued to take somewhat of a back 
seat against the british pound with the pound testing the 190 
mark against the us currency 
a report of fasterthanexpected growth in britains money 
supply led market participants in london to believe sterling 
interest rates will not be lowered 
that makes the pound an attractive alternative to the 
dollar mcgroarty said

noted that market participants remain bearish about the us 
currency but most traders believe fears of central bank 
intervention keep investors from trying to aggressively sell their 
dollar holdings

the house today passed sweeping trade 
legislation ignoring fresh veto threats from president reagan and 
defiantly upholding the measures embattled plant closings 
provisions 
our future is not in the past house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said as he urged approval of the bill with the plant 
closings feature intact we can regain our competitiveness we 
can be no 1 again 
the bill passed by a vote of 312107 
president reagan on the road in massachusetts said he would 
veto the legislation if it arrived on his desk with the plant 
closings provision included in it 
he also sent a letter to house minority leader robert h michel 
rill saying i want a trade bill 
i will work vigorously to secure one reagan said and i 
will urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill 
immediately after congress sustains my forthcoming veto of the 
current trade bill 
the house rejected 253167 a move by michel to return the trade 
bill to a housesenate conference committee with orders to drop the 
plant closings provision 
critics of the provision warned that it would not only trigger a 
veto but that if it went into law it would cripple american 
business by drying up capital for investment frightening off 
customers and causing other problems 
the measure would require all but the smallest employers to 
provide 60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the provision completely overshadowed the centerpiece features 
of the legislation which would streamline the system under which 
the united states imposes import curbs to aid industries threatened 
by foreign competition and retaliate against international trade 
violations 
scores of other features range from repeal of the windfall 
profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in agricultural 
subsidies 
republicans portrayed the measure as doomed to a veto with the 
plant closings provision still part of it 
im more interested in plant openings than plant closings 
said rep tom delay rtexas 
we can exorcise this demon said rep william frenzel 
rminn 
the legislation would overhaul the system under which the 
government retaliates against international trade violations and 
uses import curbs to aid american industries hurt by surging 
foreign competition 
these provisions have figured little in battles over the bill in 
recent weeks however the white house has issued numerous threats 
of a presidential veto if the plantclosings provisions remain 
efforts to whisk the bill through the house rules committee on 
wednesday were stalled for hours over democratic concerns that 
michel would muster the strength on the floor to send the measure 
back to the committee 
it is my hope that through this motion we will be able to get 
a trade bill that can actually be enacted into law michel said 
after the rules committee cleared the way for him to go ahead with 
his plan 
the idea of a veto over plant closings is proving less than 
appetizing to lawmakers with a host of narrow electionyear items 
tucked into the trade bill ranging from repeal of the windfall 
profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in agricultural 
subsidies 
treasury secretary james a baker iii came to capitol hill on 
wednesday to try to rally republican house members to oppose the 
measure if the measures on plant closings remained in 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters wednesday 
the administration was pessimistic about chances that lawmakers 
would send the president legislation he would sign 
i would say we are not too optimistic at this point 
fitzwater said the indications have been that the congress is 
not going to relent on plant closings as well as some of the other 
provisions so i would say that we are pretty pessimistic that we 
will get a bill that we could sign

soybean futures prices fell sharply thursday on the chicago 
board of trade as rain dampened the dry fields of the western corn 
belt and the south american soybean harvest accelerated grains 
also finished lower 
on other markets energy futures advanced stockindex futures 
plunged precious metals were mixed and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed 
rain in western iowa and nebraska where spring planting has 
just begun melted fears that dry conditions would delay 
germination of seeds analysts said 
soybean prices came under additional pressure from the brazilian 
soybean harvest now more than 50 percent complete and the 
beginning of the argentine soybean harvest said richard loewy 
senior grain and oilseed analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york 
they should be 80 to 85 percent finished in may he said of 
the south american harvest then our crush and export rate will 
tail off and you dont get as much domestic meal feeding anyway as 
we get into the warmer weather 
further pressure on the soy complex came from an american 
soybean association statement that it did not expect the 
agriculture department to offer the soviet union 170000 metric 
tons of us soybean oil under its export enhancement program 
loewy said 
wheat settled cent to 1 cent lower with the contract for 
delivery in may at 314 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents 
lower with may at 202 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents

cents lower with may at 659 a bushel 
energy futures staged a broad rally on the new york mercantile 
exchange on reports that seven nonopec countries would meet with 
opecs price committee next week in venice to discuss production 
cuts

would be meeting with nonopec producers was a very positive 
sign said nauman barakat of smith barney harris upham amp co 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 36 cents to 38 cents 
higher with june at 1836 a barrel heating oil was 76 cent to

index settled 17 points lower at 25620 
gold futures finished modestly lower on the commodity exchange

force interest rates higher to bring in more foreign investors to 
prop up the dollar and ward off a recession said jack barbanel an 
analyst with gruntal amp co in new york 
recession fears have been absent recently from the metals 
markets which have generally been trading higher on expecations of 
increased inflation 
but barbanel said traditional indicators of inflation such as 
widespread price increases for goods and services have not 
surfaced 
one has to seriously question this whole idea about 
inflation he said the fed may be using inflation as a 
scapegoat to say we have to tighten money and get the interest 
rates up higher 
platinum settled 540 to 590 lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange with july at 52670 a troy ounce on the comex gold was

tandy corp stepped up in the big leagues of 
both personal computing and music thursday with a fast new pc and a 
new kind of rerecordable compact disk 
analysts said both announcements demonstrated the evolution of 
fort worth texasbased tandy as a leader in technology 
these guys are changing their image from being just a retailer 
to being an innovator said clifford friedman an analyst with 
cj lawrence inc 
tandy stock rose 262 a share to 4575 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
the new personal computer is due for volume shipments in july 
and is likely to be the first on the market that follows the design 
of international business machines corps yearold personal 
system2 
dell computer corp of austin texas announced a 
ps2compatible machine on monday but said it would not be 
available until the final quarter of 1988 tandys version has 
technological advantages over ibms own computer 
while a new personal computer was widely expected tandy pulled 
a surprise with its announcement of an unusual compact disk that 
can be repeatedly erased and rerecorded 
tandy said the compact disk known as the thor cd would have 
the advantages of huge storage capacity and high fidelity without 
the disadvantage of being unalterable 
it will be available for music in 1 to two years and for data 
about a year after that once recording and playback devices are 
built tandy said the thor cd could also be played although not 
recorded on in standard compact disk players 
tandy will make thor cd equipment and license other companies to 
make it and expects that some day the invention might yield the 
company hundreds of millions of dollars a year in additional 
profits from sales and royalties john roach tandys chairman and 
chief executive said at a new york news conference 
the announcement drew a critical response from the recording 
industry association of america because it would allow people to 
make highquality recordings of commercial compact disks at home 
the group has been battling against digital audio tape another 
technology that is ideal for copying 
were always concerned about technologies that threaten to 
enable consumers to infringe on copyrights said spokeswoman 
trish heimers 
indeed opposition from the recording industry might hold up the 
tandy invention said leonard laub president of vision three inc 
a new yorkbased consulting firm 
as with music the thor cd would allow computer users to create 
their own data libraries 
on its new tandy 5000 mc personal computer tandy tried to 
assure potential customers that the machine would not be knocked 
down by a patent lawsuit by ibm 
the company said the computer was covered by an existing patent 
crosslicensing agreement with ibm although it said certain ps2 
patents that may be issued to ibm in the future are still subject 
to negotiations 
analysts are betting that ibm will not try to block tandy they 
say tandys quality is high enough that ibm wont be embarrassed by 
shoddy goods and they say the companies are not direct 
competitors with ibm focusing on the fortune 1000 and tandy 
focusing on what it calls the unfortunate 6 million small and 
mediumsized companies 
in addition some big ibm customers have been telling ibm they 
would feel more comfortable buying the personal system2 if they 
knew there was another company that could serve as a second source 
for the product 
tandy seems to have shaken off its image as a company for 
hobbyists tinkerers and bargain hunters 
tandy is a classact company said esther dyson editor of 
release 10 a computer newsletter 
the suggested price for one popular configuration of the tandy 
5000 mc with a 40megabyte hard disk drive is 6499 compared to 
6995 for ibms ps2 model 80 with a 44megabyte hard disk drive

battling to win four seats on its board hinted at victory thursday 
as the scramble for shareholder votes gave way to the ballot count 
that will determine the winner 
shareholder proxy ballots were filed thursday at gillettes 
annual meeting a key step in the fourmonth effort by coniston 
group force a sale or merger of the bostonbased personal products 
company 
although preliminary results are not expected for at least a 
week both coniston principals and gillette executives expressed 
optimism they would prevail 
obviously we think we will win coniston principal augustus 
k oliver said after the threehour annual meeting at which several 
shareholders drew applause for criticizing new yorkbased coniston 
we think were ahead and were looking forward to the results 
although coniston would control only onethird of the board if 
successful oliver said a coniston victory would constitute a 
shareholder mandate for the groups agenda 
colman m mockler jr gillettes chairman and chief executive 
declined to give specific projections but stated we are pleased 
with the results so far 
gillette rose 150 to 4175 a share in composite new york 
stock exchange trading 
the contest likely will be decided by institutional investors 
such as pension funds and insurance companies which own between 60 
percent to 65 percent of the 1155 million gillette shares 
outstanding 
coniston controls 676 million gillette shares about 58 
percent of the companys shares outstanding coniston also claims 
to have the support of several major shareholders 
since early march both sides have been battling in the courts 
and the press while seeking support from the companys nearly 
27000 shareholders 
in a final presentation at thursdays meeting coniston 
principal paul e tierney jr told nearly 800 shareholders their 
investments would produce large financial dividends through the 
sale of gillettes corporate empire 
tierney also said coniston would remove provisions designed to 
shield the company from takeovers and to protect top management 
posts 
oliver said the group seeks to sell the company as a whole 
entity except for the possible divestment of some divisions in 
the meantime he pledged to devote more corporate resources to 
research and development and product marketing 
oliver said no potential buyers have approached coniston so far 
although he indicated the group would consider a proposal by revlon 
group inc revlon in november 1986 abandoned repeated attempts to 
take over gillette after receiving a nearly 580 million stock 
repurchase and signed a 10year pact not to seek control of the 
company 
mockler one of the directors whose seat is being challenged 
denied published reports that six suitors hade signed an agreement 
to purchase the company 
mockler and other gillette officers gave presentations stressing 
the companys worldwide growth and increased profitability since 
its restructuring and dismissal of 2400 workers after signing the 
revlon pact no mention was made of plans to close plants or 
further reduce its 30000member workforce 
in addition to the proxy fight gillette and coniston are 
entangled in legal battles gillette is attempting to have the 
results of the shareholder vote invalidated and coniston has sued 
gillette for allegedly using false and misleading information in 
its campaign to win shareholder votes 
coniston nominated oliver tierney coniston principal keith r 
gollust and former cable television executive david strassler for 
threeyear director posts 
in addition to mockler the company placed gillette directors

corn syrup maker staley continental 
inc rejected as inadequate a 133 billion takeover bid from a 
british company thursday but indicated it might entertain a better 
offer 
tate amp lyle plc which made the 32ashare cash tender offer 
april 8 declined comment on staleys decision but one analyst said 
he expected the british sugar refiner to increase its bid 
tate amp lyle did announce it has arranged a 13 billion loan 
agreement wiht a group of 14 banks to finance a takeover 
staley stock rose 75 cents to 3750 a share in new york stock 
exchange composite trading 
staley the nations secondlargest refiner of corn sweeteners 
said it would consider various alternatives for enhancing 
shareholder value the options include a financial restructuring or 
recapitalization issuing stock to a third party selling all or 
part of the company a joint venture or a leveraged buyout staley 
chairman donald e nordlund said in a letter to stockholders 
spokesman david satterfield said staley had held discussions 
with at least one other party but added that the company wanted to 
remain independent 
i think the board has asked management to look at all the 
various alternatives because as part of its fiduciary 
responsibility theyve got to be able to make the best judgment 
possible for shareholders satterfield said 
one option likely to present itself is a higher offer from tate 
amp lyle said john m mcmillan an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
i think they officially put the for sale sign on the 
company mcmillan said but from a shareholders point of view 
they said all the right things that theyre contemplating 
alternative moves designed to enhance the value of staleys stock 
beyond the 32 that tate and lyle offered 
mcmillan said staley probably was worth about 40 a share but 
he said he doubted a bidding war would develop 
i dont think theres a line of bidders that want to get into 
the us sweetener industry he said its a competitive market 
and it takes special managerial skills 
tate amp lyle is britains secondlargest sugar refiner an 
acquisition of staley would give it a foothold in the us corn 
sweetener market and make it the only supplier of all three types 
of sugar corn beet and cane in the united states 
tate amp lyles owns nearly 5 percent of staleys 304 million 
outstanding shares of common stock and is offering to buy all 
outstanding shares of all classes of stock in a deal it valued at 
133 billion 
tate amp lyles chairman neil m shaw has said he would move the 
companys headquarters from suburban chicago back to decatur the 
site of staleys largest cornprocessing plant and the companys 
home until three years ago 
staley continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 for 
the ae staley manufacturing co and cfs continental inc a

our competitiveness we can be no1 again 
the final tally 312107 contradicted numerous forecasts that 
the bills sponsors would fail to produce the twothirds vote 
needed to override a veto 
but many lawmakers even if they had their doubts appeared to 
have no taste in an election year for going on record against a 
measure billed as a plan to upgrade american competitiveness 
the bill was a housesenate compromise on two competing measures 
that passed both chambers last year the measure now goes to the 
senate where majority leader robert c byrd dwva planned to 
begin debate friday he was shooting for a vote on final passage 
early next week 
the house passed the measure after defeating 253167 a move by 
minority leader robert h michel rill to throw the bill back to 
the conference committee and drop the plantclosings provision 
reagan on the road in massachusetts said he would veto the 
bill if it came to him with the plantclosings provision intact he 
also sent a letter to michel saying i want a trade bill 
i will work vigorously to secure one reagan said and i 
will urge the leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill 
immediately after the congress sustains my forthcoming veto of 
the current trade bill 
controversy over the plantclosings provision overshadowed 
central features of the bill which would streamline the way the 
united states imposes import curbs to aid us industries and 
retaliate against international trade violations 
scores of other provisions ranged from repeal of the windfall 
profits tax to billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies 
dueling over plant closings provision went on almost to the last 
minute 
i am more interested in plant openings than plant closings 
said rep tom delay rtexas 
however rep augustus hawkins dcalif said it would be a 
mistake to allow such an important measure to become hung up on one 
provision it is so modest so watered down so full of 
exceptions that it probably will not have as much effect as 
lawmakers intended he said 
debate focused heavily on the provision that would require all 
but the smallest employers to give 60day notice of upcoming plant 
closings and largescale layoffs the measure contains a number of 
exceptions for companies that sudenly find themselves in an 
emergency 
the centerpiece provisions would streamline the system under 
which the united states imposes import curbs and other means to aid 
industries threatened by foreign competition and retaliate against 
international trade violatrions 
scores of other provisions range from repeal of the windfall 
profits tax on oil companies to billions of dollars in new 
agricultural subsidies 
house ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill said the bill for the first time establishes a policy 
that will make america a winner in international competitive 
markets 
but rep richard a gephardt dmo whose amendment to roll 
back japanese trade surpluses was dropped earlier said the measure 
did not go far enough in forcing open foreign markets 
rep edward r madigan rill said that with the ink barely 
dry he had discovered that the 1000page bill would increase the 
amount of caribbean ethanol allowed in dutyfree 
i thought we were going to try to create jobs i thought we 
were going to create markets madigan said but here we are 
trying to give away some of our own jobs and give away some of our 
own markets just exactly the oppsosite of what we said we were 
trying to do 
but rep sam gibbons dfla said this bill will put pressure 
on our trading competitors to open up their markets and play fairly 
and squarely with the trading system that we already have 
republican critics of the plantclosings provision cited 
business fears that plantclosings notice would reduce credit 
frighten customers cut productivity and perhaps lead to sabotage 
among disappointed employees facing layoffs they also said it had 
no direct connection with the trade issue

a majority of nbc employees are skeptical of 
general electric cos commitment to continue ownership of the 
network according to results of a survey conducted by nbc and 
described in a letter sent to employees by nbc president robert c 
wright on thursday 
ge is viewed with skepticism and uncertainty more employees 
feel that ge will not continue its nbc ownership even with nbc 
performing well than believe ge will be around for the long 
haul wright said 
he said even more employees believe ge will not allow nbc to 
operate independently and many dont like the effect the new 
corporate owner has had on their working environment 
ge which is based in fairfield conn acquired nbc in 1986 as 
part of its purchase of the rca corp based in new york wright 
was a ge executive before taking over as nbc president and chief 
executive officer 
a high percentage of employees do not feel their jobs are 
secure wright said nevertheless he said they feel better off 
than people in similar jobs in other areas of the industry 
while almost half of the employees say they are not encouraged 
by the direction they see nbc taking today a majority of employees 
say they are not likely to leave the company because of 
dissatisfaction wright said in the letter 
all of this anxiety is understandable he wrote 
change is always stressful and the vast changes that are 
taking place in the broadcasting business have understandably 
resulted in considerable employee anxiety and insecurity the 
survey clearly reflects this 
nonetheless wright said most employees said they were happy 
with their jobs and a majority were felt their salaries compared 
favorably to the rest of the industry 
wright concluded the letter by assuring employees that you 
have been heard he said next month employees would be asked to 
participate in discussions of problems mentioned in the survey 
creating an atmosphere in which we can go forward with far 
less doubt about nbcs goals and intentions is the first priority 
of our management team for the coming year wright said

usg corp said wednesday it would allow its 
stockholders to decide whether the company should drop its 
poisonpill takeover defense which is a major impediment to a 
texas groups 163 billion takeover attempt 
but usg said the offer was conditioned on the willingness of the 
investor group desert partners lp to extend the deadline for 
its takeover bid a provision criticized by desert partners 
desert partnerss offer of 42 a share cash for 85 percent of 
usgs stock has been spurned as inadequate by the company a maker 
of building materials 
usgs poison pill seeks to make a hostile takeover prohibitively 
expensive by allowing management to issue more shares if a bidder 
acquires more than 20 percent of the companys stock 
desert partners which owns about 98 percent of usgs 
outstanding stock repeatedly has called on usg to rescind the 
poison pill and issued a statement that it was pleased usg was 
putting the issue to a shareholder vote 
however the group criticized usgs request for it to extend its 
offer through june 16 from its current expiration on friday desert 
partners said usg provided no assurance that it would refrain from 
taking other defensive moves during that time 
the partnership reiterated that it is willing to negotiate all 
aspects of its offer including price the statement concluded 
efforts to reach desert partners for further comment beyond the 
statement were unsuccessful and a message was not immediately 
returned after business hours late wednesday 
usg announced late wednesday that it would submit the 
poisonpill question to a special shareholder vote on june 6 if 
desert partners extended its tender offer to june 16 
if 85 percent of usg shareholders voted to rescind the poison 
pill usg would do so by june 16 stated robert j day usg 
chairman and chief executive officer 
the usg board has previously concluded that the desert 
partners offer is wholly inadequate coercive and not in the best 
interests of usg and its stockholders day said 
we believe that by submitting the rights plan to a stockholder 
vote in a free noncoercive atmosphere the stockholder vote will 
support the boards conclusion he said 
desert partners which is controlled by oilmen jack brown and 
cyril wagner jr of midland texas also is trying to circumvent 
the poison pill by waging a proxy fight to fill six spots on usgs 
15member board of directors at the companys may 11 annual meeting
