the postelection meeting of democratic state 
party leaders is turning into a paul kirk tribute 
throughout the opening session friday of a twoday meeting of the 
association of state democratic chairs party leaders appealed to 
kirk to serve another four years as national party chairman 
we need you former arizona governor bruce babbitt told kirk 
at a luncheon in his honor 
babbitt turned to kirks wife gail and said you have only 
one husband to give to your party and damn it we need him for 
another four years 
when kirk rose to address the association at a post luncheon 
meeting the state party leaders chanted four more years four 
more years 
we must urge him and if need be draft him for another term 
said sam shipley the delaware democratic party chairman 
but kirk gave the party officials no encouragement except to say 
he would not make a decision until after thanksgiving 
four years is a long time he said eight years is twice as 
long 
waiting in the wings should kirk step down in february when his 
fouryear term ends were five contenders for the post four of whom 
said they would not run if kirk agrees to serve a second term 
the one exception was ron brown a washington lawyer and former 
party official who was convention manager for jesse jackson 
obviously it changes the equation tremendously he said when 
asked what he would do if kirk agreed to seek another term 
many party officials have said they oppose brown because of his 
tie to jackson 
jesses a friend said brown im proud of the role i 
played in the jackson campaign but im my own person not his 
person 
the other potential contenders for the party leadership post were 
rick wiener chairman of the michigan democratic party and president 
of the state chairs association and former congressmen michael 
barnes of maryland james jones of oklahoma and jim stanton of ohio 
kirk urged the democrats to avoid divisive battles region 
against region left against right constituency against 
constituency 
he cited democratic gains in 1988 elections for state and local 
offices and said there is no republican mandate 
the democrats have lost five of the last six presidential 
elections but kirk urged the party not to fall into the trap of 
thinking we must change everything weve done in order to win the 
next presidential election 
there was sentiment at the meeting for reexamining once again 
the party rules for selecting presidential nominees 
we need to visit that process said john baker alabama party 
chairman who added he wasnt certain what if any changes ought to 
be made 
barnes suggested he thought changes made at the 1988 convention 
as part of a compromise with jackson might be rescinded 
one of those changes reduced the future influence of party and 
elected officials at conventions 
we want to get elected officials people with constituencies 
up front in the nominating process said the former congressman

presidentelect george bush is searching for an 
alternative policy toward nicaragua that could form the basis for a 
more unified us foreign policy than has existed during the reagan 
administration says house speaker jim wright 
wright held a 1hour luncheon for bush on friday at the capitol 
during which the two men agreed on the need for cooperative 
solutions to foreign policy problems and to the federal budget 
deficit 
speaking to reporters afterward wright said he found bush 
anxious to establish regular lines of communication with 
congressional leaders and realistic in facing up to the nations 
problems 
he is quite earnestly interested in the realities of the 
deficit wright dtexas told reporters he has no illusions 
he is prepared to do the serious things necessary to cope with 
them 
wright also said he was encouraged that there would be a basis 
for bipartisanship in foreign policy and he singled out nicaragua 
a bone of contention throughout reagans presidency as a 
particular bright spot 
im encouraged to believe that there is a search for a policy 
that will be acceptable both to the president and to the congress 
wright said i would be willing to help in that search to the 
extent that my help is wanted 
bush has spoken vaguely during the campaign about continuing 
support for the contra rebels the freedom fighters whom reagan 
made the centerpiece of his approach to central america but bush 
has never said clearly whether he would seek renewed military aid 
for the rebels who now are essentially reduced to refugee status 
however abc news reported friday that the bush transition team 
has drafted a working paper indicating the presidentelect would 
discontinue efforts to win lethal aid for the contras from congress 
and instead focus on diplomatic pursuits 
on the economic agenda wright said bush had spoken positively of 
the national economic commission the group now at work on solutions 
to the nations debt problems 
that seemed to be at odds with bushs campaign rhetoric the vice 
president had described the commission as a subterfuge to usher in 
tax increases which he had vowed would not happen at the luncheon 
such comments were moderated wright said 
he said he recognized the important work of the commission and 
wants to work with it the speaker said 
in addition bush recognized the seriousness of the deficit 
problem and the challenge to cut 32 billion from federal red ink to 
meet deficit reduction targets wright said 
hes not hiding from it he wants to be realistic wright 
said 
wright declined to say whether bush had outlined specific ways to 
cope with the deficit saying only that he is prepared to do what 
is necessary 
he said there was a discussion of methods of maintaining a 
continuing dialogue between congress and the white house but 
declined to say whether any regular meeting schedule will be 
established bush prefers to wait until he is president before he 
begins to announce such things as that wright said 
bushs trip to capitol hill was a hopeful signal that the two men 
would be able to work together in mutual respect wright said 
i thought that was a good sign it showed he was willing to 
come halfway rather than asking me to go down to the white house 
if youre looking for symbolism i think it shows a willingness to 
work with us

i meant it when i said i want to work closely with him and members 
of the house of representatives no matter which side of the aisle 
they sit on i want to get off to a very good start 
wright dtexas sounded a hopeful note for a working 
relationship on ways to reduce the federal budget deficit and other 
issues he said after the meeting that bush will have closer ties 
with congress than did president reagan 
he said bush is quite earnestly interested in the realities of 
the deficit a likely contentious issue especially given bushs 
campaign pledge not to raise taxes to cut the deficit

to cooperate and work with congress said his transition press 
secretary sheila tate 
wright acknowledged the symbolism of bush coming to his domain 
rather than insisting the speaker go to the vice presidents office 
it showed he was willing to come halfway rather than 
asking me to go down to the white house

charlottesville va in what he said was an effort to send an 
early signal to the governors and the states of my interests in 
working with the governors democrats and republicans alike

catastrophic health coverage and the national economic commission 
established by congress to make recommendations on budget issues

the justice department lent support to oliver 
l norths defense by challenging the irancontra prosecutors 
contention that the former presidential aide illegally subverted 
congress role in foreign affairs 
the department says it is not seeking dismissal of the central 
charge that north former national security adviser john m 
poindexter arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord conspired to illegally divert usiran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
but in a friendofthecourt brief filed friday in federal court 
the department disputed independent counsel lawrence e walshs 
contention that north and his codefendants stymied congressional 
oversight through deceit and concealment of their covert 
operation to help the nicaraguan rebels 
a department official said the brief was filed only after much 
anguish and with great reluctance 
echoing statements by north and his lawyers the department said 
this case in fact arises in the context of a profound policy 
dispute between the executive and legislative branches with respect 
to foreign affairs 
a prosecutor acting in the midst of such a dispute must 
exercise great caution first to distinguish violations of law 
from policy disagreements which are the expected and natural 
byproduct of separated powers and to make certain that the laws 
are applied consistently with the scope of the presidents 
substantial constitutional authority in the area of foreign 
affairs 
walshs brief does not demonstrate sufficient caution in either 
respect the department said 
the justice departments statement was filed in response to a 
legal argument walsh made in a brief last month that the entire 
clandestine program in support of the contras financed by north 
aimed to defeat and obstruct the lawful functions of the congress 
walsh said the defendants conspired to defraud the government by 
deceitfully interfering with the constitutional appropriations and 
oversight functions of congress and the policies adopted as a 
result of congress exercise of those functions 
walsh said the defendants violated a number of congressional 
restrictions including the socalled boland amendments ban on aid 
to the nicarauguan rebels known as contras the series of boland 
amendments were enacted as part of spending bills 
the department took no position on whether the boland amendments 
applied to north and other national security council aides but it 
said congress cannot through its appropriations or other powers 
invade any sphere of constitutional authority granted exclusively to 
the president 
the justice department argued that walsh incorrectly assigned to 
congress broad powers over foreign affairs not provided by the 
constitution 
contrary to the ics suggestion there is a sphere of 
presidential activity that could not constitutionally be limited by 
any congressional enactment said the brief by assistant attorneys 
general edward sg dennis jr head of the criminal division and 
douglas w kmiec head of the office of legal counsel 
invoking the doctrine of executive privilege the justice 
department also challenged walshs assertion that congress must be 
kept informed of covert operations 
because of the doctrine of executive privilege and the 
presidents inherent foreign affairs authority congress authority 
to compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity is 
necessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations 
the department did not dispute walshs proposition that the 
charge covers a conspiracy to violate federal laws and to defraud 
president reagan by corrupting his efforts to free american hostages 
by selling arms to iran 
dennis told reporters a courts adoption of the departments 
position would not necessarily result in dismissal of 
allegations in the indictments first count that the defendants 
illegally helped arm the contras 
kmiec said theres no basis to any suggestion that the brief 
was filed to create a legal justification for presidential pardons 
of north and his codefendants 
the brief is crafted and filed only in response to the 
memorandum filed by the ic at the end of october he said it was 
filed only after much anguish and with great reluctance 
spokesman loye miller said the justice department has not come 
to the defense of oliver north the fact that oliver north is the 
defendant involved in the case is coincidental 
if a special prosecutor had taken the same position about 
congress foreign policy role in another case the issue would be 
the same miller said the executive branch would be very 
upset 
in a statement walshs office said the justice departments 
memorandum misstates our brief it is addressed largely to 
collateral issues that should obscure the criminal charges in the 
indictment returned by the grand jury 
north who is set to be the first of the four irancontra 
defendants to stand trial is also charged with 15 other felonies 
including lying to congress obstructing a presidential 
investigation of the irancontra affair and pocketing 90000 in 
travelers checks from the contras 
no date has been set for his trial

agriculture department economists say rising 
consumer income should fuel a continued growth in demand for farm 
products and that the nations overall economic expansion is likely 
to continue beyond next year 
the expansion is supported by continued improvement in the net 
export deficit which likely will induce businesses to invest 
further in new plants and equipment the departments economic 
research service said in a report friday 
the agency added that continued rising consumer income should 
support domestic demand for agricultural products 
little change is seen in the interest rates paid by farmers 
cash receipts for livestock sold this year are up 2 percent to 3 
percent from 1987 and crop receipts are up 8 percent because of 
strong prices and large marketings from past years inventories 
the report said 
recent large payments on farm debt amassed in the early and 
mid1980s appear to be over with loan volumes rising again at 
commercial banks and the cooperative farm credit system it said 
that is taken as an indication that many farmers are gearing up 
again 
except for the farmers home administration major farm lenders 
report stronger loan portfolios in 1988 and reductions in farm loan 
delinquencies loan chargeoffs and foreclosures the report said 
however some farmers are still under severe financial stress 
the agency continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers 
the difference between gross cash income and cash expenses at 
55 billion to 60 billion compared with last years record 571 
billion 
net cash income is the money farmers have to spend during the 
year including cash from sales of crops stored from previous 
harvests many farmers sold off inventories to make up for 1988 
drought losses

the federal aviation administration has been 
ordered to conduct an immediate review of the busy northeast 
corridor air traffic control system because of a series of errors 
that involved air force one according to an unpublished letter 
transportation secretary jim burnley ordered the review in a 
letter to faa administrator allan mcartor earlier this week two 
days after a federal investigation revealed that a string of 
controller errors caused air force one and a commuter plane to fly 
too close to one another over new jersey last month 
a copy of the letter was obtained friday by the associated press 
the two aircraft came within 500 feet vertically and 15 miles 
horizontally as they both began a descent into newark international 
airport on oct 12 about half as close as is normally allowed by 
federal regulation 
the national transportation safety board earlier this week urged 
a review of the air traffic control operations in the northeast 
after concluding its investigation into the incident 
the safety board said while the presidents plane never may have 
been in danger of a collision the incident revealed problems that 
could lead to an erosion of safety in the high density northeast 
air traffic system 
at times during the oct 12 incident some air controllers 
handling traffic near air force one did not know the location of the 
presidents jet as it flew from philadelphia to newark and in one 
case two controllers noticed the presidents jet and the bar harbor 
airlines commuter plane converging but did not raise an alarm 
burnley in his nov 17 letter to mcartor said the ntsb 
investigation describes a series of managerial operational and 
training deficiencies that i am sure you agree are unacceptable 
burnley directed mcartor to proceed immediately with a broad 
system safety and efficiency review of air traffic control 
procedures at the four faa facilties near washington new york and 
philadelphia similar to one conducted after a string of controller 
errors at chicagos ohare international airport 
burnley also said he wanted the responsiblity for controller 
quality assurance separated from the air traffic control bureacracy 
and brought directly under the faa administrator by dec 7 
this current organizational structure simply has not 
worked burnley said in the letter he noted that the ntsb report 
had cited controller problems that had been acknowledged as early as 
l986 and remained uncorrected a year or two later at both the 
washington and new york air traffic control centers 
he said eight of 14 operational problems found in a l987 review 
of air traffic procedures at the washington center remained 
uncorrected over a year later

when emperor hirohito was stricken two months ago 
japan donned the cloak of jisshuku selfrestraint in deference 
to his condition now they are weary of waiting and gloom and many 
complain of losing money 
sumiko iwao a sociologist at keio university said people 
expected hirohito 87 to die fairly soon after he coughed up blood 
from an intestinal hemorrhage sept 19 
they canceled all these events and toned things down thinking 
it would only be two weeks she said now there are lots of 
economic repercussions people are saying havent we done too 
much 
eriko kurabayashi said so many things have been canceled 
concerts yearend parties sports events if all this was something 
that could help the emperor all right but its caused so many 
problems for people 
she said her company which sells stuffed animals and party 
decorations is in a slump because stores are buying a lot fewer 
of our products especially stores near the imperial palace 
hotel banquet business has declined dramatically because people 
want to avoid the appearance of celebration manufacturers of 
christmas ornaments complain of slow sales and some say there will 
be no traditional yearend bonuses for employees 
commercial television will lose money when hirohito dies because 
commercials will be taken off the air for two days 
a network reporter speaking on condition of anonymity said 
financially all the television stations are hoping the emperors 
death is announced before 6 pm it may be terrible to say but if 
it comes later in the night well lose advertising income for that 
night plus two full days 
while the emperor lives news media spend hundreds of thousands 
of dollars daily keeping reporters sound trucks cars and drivers 
at the palace and on 24hour standby 
some reporters have been hospitalized with fatigue and others 
spend so much time at the palace they have clean underwear sent by 
express mail 
the post office has a particular dilemma about new year greeting 
cards which sell for 40 yen 33 cents and and are marked with the 
year of the emperors reign 
it printed 37 billion cards marked showa 64 for the 64th year of 
hirohitos showa era but if the emperor dies before 1989 begins 
the cards should carry the mark of the new imperial era as yet 
unnamed 
palace and government officials remain resolutely silent about 
what will happen when hirohito dies any comment would acknowledge 
that the government is preparing for the death of the man who has 
ruled longer than any living monarch and once was considered divine 
some sectors of the public are less deferential opposition 
political parties condemn excessive reverence for the emperor which 
they say is fostered by bureaucrats and the press 
a group calling itself christians proposing the emperors apology 
wants hirohito to apologize for japans conduct in world war ii 
in a letter to crown prince akihito the organization said japan 
had ruled other asian countries brutally in the emperors name and

researchers and environmental activists are 
setting strategy in seattle this weekend to combat what they see as 
literally a lifeanddeath problem the rapid disappearance of the 
earths rain forests 
the forests are like the lungs of the planet and we know 
now that the burning of particularly rain forests contributes as 
much as 25 percent of the carbon dumping into the atmosphere said 
randall hayes and whether you live in iceland or seattle or the 
middle of the amazon the greenhouse effect is going to affect 
you 
by 2050 virtually all large tracts of rain forest will be 
gone said hayes director of the californiabased rainforest 
action network and a conference participant so essentially were 
the last generation on earth that will have a chance to save the 
tropical rain forests if we dont well have to live with the 
effects if we can 
while the devastation of tropical rain forests has received much 
notice in recent years the conference also will consider what 
deforestation means to the lush temperate rain forests of the 
pacific northwest 
if we stopped the import of tropical timber that would put 
more pressure on the pacific northwest so we need a more integrated 
plan to tackle this issue as a whole hayes said 
i think its really important that we take a global look at 
forestry and get out of the inourbackyard syndrome agreed pam 
crocker davis a conference organizer and former director of the 
state audubon society 
to make the connection between what it happening in the tropics 
and what is happening here is critical she said 
the conference at the university of washington is titled decade 
of the rain forest strategies for tropical amp temperate survival 
its value is in bringing together a wide variety of participants 
including nonprofessionals hayes said 
citizen watchdog groups are going to be key in saving the 
forests he said weve learned that we clearly cannot leave 
this in the hands of the federal government and we cant leave it in 
the hands of the industry 
but the effort needs to go in myriad directions he noted 
we dont want to win the tropical rain forest battle and have 
the end result of having the forests in the united states and canada 
be annihilated he said 
conference organizers lay out some stark figures to drive home 
their point an estimated 24 billion acres of tropical rain forest 
survive in the world but it is disappearing at a rate of about 1 
percent per year or about one acre per second they say 
in the western united states less than 32 million acres remains 
of the original 15 million acres of old growth 
the weekend gathering will feature presentations and panel 
discussions on topics ranging from climate and forest management to 
the spiritual value of forests 
on monday and tuesday representatives from environmental and 
other groups will gather on whidbey island to actually plot 
strategy said marcia rutan of the chinook learning center a prime 
sponsor of the conference 
among the strategies hayes sees would be a national 
woodconservation policy including such things as wood recycling 
and developing alternative materials to use in place of wood 
another possible step is support for legislation that would ban 
tropical wood imports unless the nations producing those woods put 
together plans to save pristine rain forests he said

three unions at eastern airlines have sought a 
preliminary injunction to block the 365 million sale of its 
northeast shuttle to real estate magnate donald trump 
the motion filed friday in us district court by the 
international association of machinists the air line pilots 
association and local 553 of the transport workers union had been 
anticipated for a month 
us district judge barrington parker in october had scheduled a 
hearing on it for dec 2 giving eastern until nov 25 to file a 
response 
the three unions contend that the sale of the bostonnew 
yorkwashington shuttle violates the railway labor act as part of an 
attempt by easterns parent texas air corp to break the unions in 
the midst of collective bargaining on new contracts 
the sale is yet another attempt by texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo to dismantle eastern airlines said jack bavis head of 
the pilots union at the carrier 
although the shuttle has been consistently profitable texas air 
contends the sale is necessary to raise cash for preserving the rest 
of eastern which has lost more than 300 million since 1986

president reagan has signed legislation 
authorizing 112 billion for the national aeronautics and space 
administration and recreating a national space council an advisory 
group dissolved after the nixon years 
the legislation signed friday includes 900 million to begin work 
on a space station of which 515 million must be cleared by george 
bush by may 15 
the legislation gives the new president a say on whether to 
proceed with the space station nasa plans to ask for 21 billion 
in fiscal 1990 and a bush goahead would indicate the new 
administrations commitment to build the 24 billion station 
reagan two years ago vetoed a nasa authorization bill and took 
exception to a provision that would have reestablished a national 
space council in the presidents office to advise him on 
spacerelated matters but on friday he signed the legislation 
which does that very thing 
there have been indications that bush will name vice 
presidentelect dan quayle to head the office 
in opposing the space council earlier reagan said that besides 
creating additional and unnecessary bureaucracy the national space 
council would duplicate the functions of the interagency bodies 
that already coordinate the development and implementation of space 
policy

president reagan has signed an executive order 
aimed at speeding the nuclearplant licensing process by giving a 
federal agency sweeping new powers to carry out evacuation plans for 
disputed nuclear power plants 
white house officials issued no statements friday beyond the 
fourpage order signed by the president although the question of 
expanding the authority of the federal emergency management agency 
had been debated within the administration for months 
the principal aim of the order is to help utilities get operating 
licenses in instances where community opposition has held up 
approval of evacuation plans the plans must be okd by the nuclear 
regulatory commission before a license is granted 
the operation of two plants shoreham on long island ny and 
seabrook in new hampshire has been stalled because state and local 
governments responding to community pressures have refused to 
submit evaucation plans to the nrc 
reagans order substantially changes the role of fema in 
emergency planning for nuclear plants and gives the agency virtual 
police powers during actual radiological emergencies 
the agency shall make all necessary plans and arrangements to 
ensure that the federal government is prepared to assume any and all 
functions and undertakings necessary to provide adequate protection 
to the public the order said in part 
before licensing battles over shoreham and seabrook state 
governments had been required to submit acceptable evacuation plans 
as part of the nrc licensing process state and local opposition to 
both plants led the nrc to accept plans submitted by their 
utilityowners but both plans face challenges on grounds that 
utilities lack the police powers to carry them out in a genuine 
crisis 
reagans order addresses that problem by empowering fema to carry 
out plans 
seabrook finished two years ago has been stalled for lack of 
required emergency plans principally because massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis refuses to cooperate 
ron sher a spokesman for new hampshire yankee the company that 
operates seabrook said in a telephone interview that he did not 
believe the order was signed principally to benefit seabrook 
new hampshire under gov john sununu long ago submitted an 
emergency plan for 17 of its communities near the plant but owners 
have had to submit plans for six nearby massachusetts communities 
that have refused to participate in emergency planning they claim 
the public safety could not be assured in case of a major accident 
we just find it hard to believe that theres much in this plan 
that would help us right now sher said in the interview maybe 
it would have two years ago 
earlier this year sununu had vehemently denied that he had been 
pushing for the order to get the seabrook plant into operation 
sununu was named this week as white house chief of staff for 
presidentelect george bush 
sununus spokesman edward lecius denied in june that sununu had 
helped originate the order 
sen gordon humphrey rnh and rep judd gregg rnh who 
oppose the order had said earlier this year that they were 
pessimistic about defeating it gregg won the new hampshire 
governors race last week to succeed sununu 
paul mceachern a democratic critic of seabrook who lost to gregg 
for the governorship said the order was a foregone conclusion 
i believe they decided not to do anything until after the 
election mceachern said the circumstantial evidence is 
overwhelming that was the case that they would get it signed at the 
first appropriate time after the election 
critics called the order a major change even in advance of its 
signing by reagan 
its a major change in femas role it makes them judge and 
jury of the plan said antiseabrook attorney matthew brock 
jerry mikorenda a spokesman for the owner of the shoreham plant 
long island lighting co said reagans order resolves questions 
of legal authority and reaffirms our position though he said 
the utility will continue with its plan to sell and close the plant 
terry lynam spokesman for new york gov mario cuomo said the 
governor was not surprised by the order because the reagan 
administration is determined to get the plant open cuomo is 
opposed to the licensing of shoreham 
in a separate action reagan on friday signed an executive order 
establishing a ninemember presidents commission on catastrophic 
nuclear accidents to study ways to fully compensate victims of such 
an accident beyond the limit of public liability called for by 
congress the commission which is to file its report to congress 
by aug 20 1990 also is to recommend any changes in laws and 
rules necessary for the prompt proper payment of valid damage 
claims as well as recommend any procedures needed to handle such 
claims

an organization of american 
states committee approved a proposal to provide more diplomatic 
rights to latin ambassadors of the washingtonbased organization 
the us delegate abstained 
richard t mccormack walked out of an oas committee session after 
clashing over the resolution friday with carlos tunnerman 
nicaraguas ambassador to the oas diplomats viewed the resolution 
as a product of the tunnermans expulsion from the united states in 
july 
tunnerman was nicaraguas ambassador to the united states when he 
and seven other nicaraguan diplomats were expelled from washington 
in retaliation for nicaraguas expulsion of us ambassador richard 
melton and seven us diplomats 
nicaragua at the time claimed melton was working to destabilize 
the leftist government a charge denied by melton 
the resolution approved friday calls for study of amendments to 
agreements between the oas and the united states to provide more 
diplomatic rights for latin american representatives to the 
31member oas 
the full oas general assembly meets later today to approve all 
committee resolutions 
mccormack said he had no objections to the resolution but added 
the united states has the sovereign right to control entry to 
the united states by oas representatives 
tunnerman responded by criticizing the abusive way in which 
the reagan administration expelled him from the united states 
earlier friday an oas committee approved an interamerican human 
rights commission report that singled out chile paraguay el 
salvador cuba nicaragua and guatemala for human rights abuses

a simple gray headstone marks the graves 
of 409 people in a cemetery overlooking san francisco bay 
representing nearly half of the 913 people who died in the jonestown 
mass suicide a decade ago 
as they have every year friends and relatives of the jonestown 
victims gathered at the site friday for a memorial service on the 
anniversary of the deaths at the peoples temple jungle compound in 
guyana in south america 
its taken me a long time to get enough courage to come said 
kim dutra one of 40 people who attended the service she carried a 
bouquet of red roses to the site where her mother beverly is 
buried 
you know sometimes the best thing to do is just put it behind 
you 
dutras mother and 13yearold brother were among the 912 
followers of the rev jim jones who died along with him at jonestown 
on nov 18 1978 most committed suicide by drinking a poisonlaced 
beverage 
the mass suicide came hours after church loyalists killed a us 
congressman three journalists and a temple defector who had flown 
to the complex to investigate complaints of abuse and tyranny there 
many of the dead were cremated or buried in family cemeteries 
the 409 bodies buried at evergreen cemetery could not be 
individually identified because no fingerprints or other records 
were available in the united states 
eddie norwood recalled how his mother who was not a temple 
member kept him hidden from his father and other family members who 
did belong to the cult she feared jones was psychotic and 
dangerous and feared he would have the child kidnapped to join the 
church 
i was hurt and i did not know then but i know now said 
norwood who was 8 years old when 27 members of his family died at 
jonestown 
on friday he joined his mother jynona norwood and other 
relatives at the cemetery 
one of their relatives fred lewis stood by the grave as the 
service began clutching a banner that read 10 yr jonestown 
memorial we will not forget breaking into tears lewis told the 
gathering that he never had the emotional strength to talk at other 
memorial services 
this is the first time it happened that ive been able to cope 
with the situation he said later i feel good and im happy 
im very happy to see so many people out here today 
jynona norwood an evangelist who organizes the memorial each 
year said jones offered a utopian world that provided food 
clothing shelter and a form of religious solace to a wide spectrum 
of people poor minorities from the ghetto pimps prostitutes as 
well as the average person on the street 
the people at jonestown were people who loved other people 
they werent crazy she said 
but norwood said a powerhungry jones abused their trust and 
faith demanding absolute loyalty through sadistic mindcontrol 
techniques peoples temple turned out to be another cult she said 
under pressure from allegations of misconduct jones moved most 
of his peoples temple from san francisco to guyana the only 
englishspeaking country in south america in 1977 the cult leader 
believed he would be safe from what he perceived as media and police 
persecution 
yolanda williams a peoples temple member who left guyana about 
four months before the deaths said when i left it was with a 
measure of hope for them those remaining that maybe we would 
have a prayer 
today she said she still lives in fear that a jones loyalist 
will hunt her down for speaking out against the temple

a band a huge birthday cake and greetings 
from presidents past present and future helped carrie white 
celebrate her achievement living to age 114 making her the worlds 
oldest person 
mrs white also received a citation from the guinness book of 
world records during the celebration friday under a large blue and 
white tent at putnam memorial nursing home 
mrs white dressed in a pink dress and pink hat sat in a 
wheelchair clutched a stuffed doll and shielded her eyes from the 
glare of television lights and photographers flashes 
david banks head of the company that owns the nursing home 
where mrs white lives presented her with a certificate from the 
guinness book 
whats that she asked faintly as it was placed on her tray 
shes very aware what today is about and she dotes on attention 
and hamming it up for the cameras said marjorie allen her 
guardian 
she said mrs white has a passion for cocacola and chews red man 
tobacco 
carrie white worlds oldest person was written in frosting on 
the cake which featured 114 candles a small globe and two 
hourglasses 
several letters from wellwishers were read to a crowd of about 
500 people many of them her nursing home companions 
letters came from president reagan presidentelect george bush 
former presidents jimmy carter and gerald ford and florida gov bob 
martinez 
happy birthday how exciting to celebrate your 114th birthday 
that is quite an achievement said the letter from bush 
palatka mayor tim smith proclaimed friday carrie white day 
and said she was one of the few people who had a chance to be a 
teenager twice in a lifetime 
mrs white was born in rural gadsen county in 1874 just nine 
years after the end of the civil war 
in london guinness spokeswoman anna nicholas said friday we 
have a lot of original proof so as much as we can ever be sure 
shes the oldest person 
ms nicholas said that since mrs white was hospitalized for many 
years starting in 1909 for posttyphoid psychosis she has medical 
documentation that goes way back guinness also sends researchers 
to check on such claims and has an expert in britain who looks at 
the evidence she said 
karl dalke chief of research for the florida department of 
health and rehabilitative services said the social security 
administration also verified mrs whites age as 114 
mrs white will have to wait at least a year before her name

the nations health care costs jumped 98 
percent last year to 5003 billion or 1987 for every man woman 
and child a federal report says 
the annual report issued friday by the health care financing 
administration highlighted one of the major challenges facing the 
incoming bush administration how to insure health care for an aging 
population during a time when spending on medicare and medicaid is 
already a major contributor to the national debt 
the popular conception is that medicare is selffinanced by 
social security payroll deductions paid by retired and current 
workers 
the reality is that 75 percent of the money to pay for the 
fastest growing part of the program doctor services comes 
straight from the treasury 
all of the federal share of medicaid states pay about half 
comes from the treasury 
medicare and the federal share of medicaid accounted for 1447 
billion of the nations total health bill in 1987 an increase of 
89 percent from calendar 1986 
largely because of cost containment programs instituted by the 
reagan administration the federal increase was substantially less 
than the 117 percent increase for state and local spending and the 
98 percent rise for private spending 
still federal health spending in calendar 1987 was more than 
double the 71 billion it was the year before reagan took office in 
1981 
state and local health spending amounted to 627 billion in 1987 
and the private share was 293 billion 
measured as a part of the overall economy the 5003 billion in 
total health spending consumed a record 111 percent of the gross 
national product in 1987 up from 107 percent in 1986 gnp 
represents the total of all goods and services produced in the 
economy the health care costs work out to an average of 1987 for 
every man woman and child 
health spending was 91 percent of gnp the year before reagan 
took office and 59 percent in 1965 before the advent of medicare 
and medicaid 
providing effective health care at affordable cost is a major 
challenge confronting our society said dr william l roper the 
hcfa administrator whose agency oversees medicare and medicaid 
noting that medicare and medicaid are the largest single payers 
of medical bills accounting for 289 percent of all spending 
roper said it is imperative that we identify the most effective 
means of providing health care to avoid unnecessary and duplicate 
procedures 
the various state and local programs paid a total of 125 percent 
of medical costs in 1987 while millions of individuals and thousands 
of private insurance companies paid the other 586 percent 
the annual report which normally comes out in the summer was 
delayed this year because hcfa actuaries were occupied with changes 
in medicare and medicaid prompted by enactment of the catastrophic 
health insurance measure the largest single expansion of medicare 
in its twodecade history 
the report is figured on a calendar year basis because it 
incorporates private as well as public expenditures 
medicare expenditures alone were 799 billion in fiscal 1987 
the government accounting period from oct 1 1986 through sept 30 
1987 and increased 77 percent from fiscal 1986 a little less 
than the overall 98 percent increase 
roper noted that programs to constrain the growth of hospital 
charges resulted in an increase of less than 2 percent in medicare 
hospital spending in fiscal 1987 while payments for physicians 
services continued to grow at doubledigit rates 
between fiscal year 1975 and fiscal year 1987 medicare 
physician spending per beneficiary increased at a compound annual 
rate of 15 percent roper said in a statement accompanying the 
report 
over the next 10 years even without any program expansions we 
project that medicare spending for physicians services will 
triple said roper 
he predicted that medicare outlays will exceed the yearly 
spending for social security within two decades 
counting both public and private spending hospital care 
accounted for 39 percent of total expenditures physicians services 
20 percent and nursing homes 8 percent 
the rest went for a variety of other expenses such as medicines 
purchased directly by individuals

the iranian parliament speaker said the 
release of anglican church envoy terry waite is an issue separate 
from irans influence in lebanon the official islamic republic news 
agency reported today 
the news agency monitored in cyprus said speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani was reacting to a report that kenyan president daniel 
arap moi carried a message to iranian leaders asking them to mediate 
to gain waites release from lebanon 
moi delivered the message from unidentified christian 
authorities the agency said moi ended an official threeday 
visit thursday to iran 
the agency quoted iranian press reports saying rafsanjani 
acknowledged that the islamic republic has sway in lebanon but 
that terry waites release from captivity is simply another 
issue 
waite 49 disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his west 
beirut hotel to negotiate with islamic jihad which has claimed to 
hold kidnapped foreigners no group claimed to hold waite but he is 
widely believed to be held by shiite moslem militants 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longest held of the 15 foreign hostages in 
lebanon he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
rafsanjani who is also acting commander of the armed forces 
told university students in the southwestern provincial capital of 
ahwaz that iran should pursue an independent foreign policy without 
making enemies the news agency said 
the agency quoted him as saying iran could have pursued such a 
policy in the past without antagonizing countries such as kuwait and 
france if iran had demonstrated more tactfulness in dealing 
with those two countries they might not have supported iraq in the 
persian gulf conflict the agency said 
despite the inherent hostility with islam in the western world 
iran is now in a position to make good on her previously crude 
diplomacy the agency quoted the speaker as saying 
rafsanjani also repeated that private business would play an 
important role in postwar reconstruction the iraniraq war ended 
aug 20 in a united nationsbrokered ceasefire and since then 
little progress has been reported in peace talks

benazir bhuttos election victory set 
pakistan on the road to democracy and was the repudiation she had 
sought of the general who overthrew her father 11 years ago 
president mohammed zia ulhaq was not present to suffer public 
embarrassment he died in a plane crash three months ago 
gen zia overthrew prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto in 1977 
after pakistans last open national assembly election and bhutto 
later was convicted of complicity in a murder conspiracy he was 
hanged in 1979 
zia still has many supporters among the military and the 
affluent but the the judiciary began restoring democracy after his 
death and in wednesdays election the people took a huge second 
step 
ms bhuttos populist pakistan peoples party founded by her 
father proved that it still was the nations most powerful 
political organization 
it won 92 of the 205 national assembly seats at stake far more 
than the 54 gained by a conservative alliance of zia loyalists ms 
bhutto should be the next prime minister if she can form a majority 
coalition 
after ruling by martial law for eight years after the coup zia 
held elections for a civilian government in 1985 political parties 
were not allowed to enter candidates and ms bhuttos followers and 
others in the opposition boycotted the vote 
he let the government under prime minister mohammed khan junejo 
preside with limited powers until may then dismissed it and the 
national assembly on grounds of corruption incompetence and 
slowness in applying islamic law 
the constitution required elections be held within 90 days but 
zia ignored it in late july he called them for nov 16 again on a 
nonparty basis he died in the crash aug 17 
sources close to the general have confirmed that zia intended the 
elections to coincide with the birth of ms bhuttos first child so 
her personal campaigning would be limited she is married to asif 
ali zardari a karachi businessman 
ms bhutto 35 gave birth to a fullterm boy sept 21 after zia 
was killed family sources admitted they had said the baby was due 
in late november or early december to foil zias plans 
zias iron control began to slip in june when the supreme court 
responding to a petition filed by ms bhutto struck down his decree 
empowering the government to accept or reject political parties 
applying to enter an election 
when zia died the presidency passed to the president of the 
senate ghulam ishaq khan a 73yearold constitutional scholar 
ishaq khan hinted at change by telling his first news conference 
on the day zia was buried he would let the courts rule on the 
constitutionality of nonparty elections 
in decisions this fall the supreme court struck down the 
nonparty rule and condemned zias dismissal of the junejo 
government as capricious it also blocked an attempt by junejo to 
resume office however on grounds that might interfere with free 
and fair elections 
gen mirza aslam beg zias successor as army commander assured 
the public he had no political aspirations and pledged to keep the 
military out of the election 
in doubt is zias plan for extending islam into every aspect of 
pakistani life 
ms bhutto has said islam should be pakistans religion but not 
its politics and has pledged not to let it interfere with the 
rights of women or minorities the zia loyalists pledged support in 
their election platform but rarely mentioned it in campaign speeches

deficit 
clearly expenditures have to be cut new mexico gov garrey 
carruthers said 
taxes are still too high in this country said delaware gov 
michael n castle the conference chairman 
both men are among nearly two dozen gop chief executives planning 
to attend the national republican governors conference the agenda 
for the meeting which runs today through tuesday features a speech 
by the presidentelect on the closing day 
we need to continue to look for ways to reduce costs to invest 
in preventionoriented solutions at the state level to collect the 
billions of tax dollars that are not being collected right now 
castle said 
carruthers and castle made their comments in interviews before 
the conferences start 
most of those interviewed called for spending cuts or fiscal 
restraint and some promoted bushs flexible freeze option in 
suggesting ways to deal with the budget deficit left by the outgoing 
reagan administration 
cut spending especially on the entitlement side recommended 
new hampshire govelect judd gregg who is succeeding the man bush 
has selected as his chief of staff john sununu go after the 
colas cost of living increases dont believe anything house 
speaker jim wright has to say relative to the budget and dont make 
deals 
im sure the president plans to handle it by continuing to 
expand the economy and second by working with congress to reduce 
the level of expenditure and set spending by priorities said 
florida gov bob martinez whose state will play host to the 
governors sunday on a tour of the uss lexington at pensacola 
controlling spending is critical to deficit reduction said 
wisconsin gov tommy g thompson and the lineitem veto authority 
should be enacted to help our next president and the united states 
succeed in reducing the federal deficit 
south carolina gov carroll campbell maine gov john r mckernan 
and iowa gov terry e branstad were among those who mentioned a 
flexible freeze as an alternative

to a percentage of the inflation rate perhaps 1 percentage point 
below the consumer price index 
alabama gov guy hunt the host for the conference and the first 
republican governor of alabama this century was the only gop chief 
executive to mention specifically a balanced budget constitutional 
amendment

matters

three unmanned locomotives raced at more 
than 80 mph through five towns and across more than 200 miles of 
west texas plains until workers diverted them onto a siding where 
they crashed into a line of empty boxcars officials said 
vandals are suspected of setting the linked union pacific diesel 
locomotives loose in big spring about 100 miles south of lubbock 
about 130 am friday no one was injured 
it couldnt have happened at a better time railroad 
spokesman alex tice said from company headquarters in omaha neb 
the line was clear and there wasnt that much traffic at 
crossings out at that time of the night 
the engines sped through railroad crossings without headlights or 
any other warning the straight track west of big spring helped keep 
the engines from derailing along the way 
it was moving so fast that it was passing through the crossings 
before the signals could be activated said midland county deputy 
sheriff richard gillette 
gillette was driving behind a police car that was almost hit by 
the runaway train as it approached a crossing that apparently was 
the closest the locomotives came to hurting anyone as they traveled 
214 miles through big spring midland pecos toyah and other towns 
in western texas 
tice said the 2hour odyssey began when someone revved up the 
three engines in a rail yard in big spring setting the lead 
locomotive at full throttle he didnt know if the engines had been 
left idling which is often the case 
the train which wasnt pulling any cars ran through two 
switches in big spring and onto the main line tice said 
the engines were 40 miles down the line before midland county 
authorities alerted union pacific officials about the problem 
gillette said one deputy clocked the train at 67 mph 
union pacific authorities alerted police in counties farther 
west including gary ingram of the reeves county sheriffs office 
when i first heard about it i thought someone was telling me a 
joke ingram said i told them i might saddle my horse and try 
to run it down but i didnt think it could run that fast they 
didnt find a whole lot of humor in that 
from pecos the train sped through toyah at more than 80 mph 
tice said ingram watched the train pass about 1 miles south of his 
ranch in toyah 
a union pacific employee finally diverted the train onto a siding 
near van horn about 125 miles east of el paso 
the yellow locomotives which cost about 1 million each hit a 
line of more than 20 boxcars that had been set on the track one 
boxcar was knocked off the rails by the impact 
the lead engine skidded onto its side about 250 feet ahead of the 
other two locomotives which remained upright tice said the fact 
the two engines remained upright indicated the train had slowed for 
some reason before the derailment 
about 500 to 600 feet of track was damaged in the derailment and 
work crews were replacing that section friday afternoon 
union pacific blamed the incident on vandals and is offering a 
25000 reward for information leading to the culprits arrest and 
conviction 
it might have just been a prank by someone who didnt know what 
he had gotten into tice said 
a second unrelated railroad accident occurred friday morning in 
san antonio in that accident believed to be caused by human error 
35 boxcars derailed after rolling from a siding onto the main line 
two employees were treated for injuries a railroad spokesman said

atampt telephone service along the east 
coast was disrupted for about six hours when an underground 
transmission cable was severed by a work crew causing computer 
problems as well as telephone outages 
the trouble friday was caused when a backhoe apparently severed 
the 3inch fiberoptic cable at a railroad yard in sayreville 
south of newark 
the accident forced massive rerouting of telephone calls that 
ordinarily use the line which carries about 200000 calls an hour 
said atampt district manager jim nelson 
its almost like a highway in that you have to go along it to 
get from say new york to florida said nelson this is a major 
blockage affecting the whole east coast 
the outage which began at 1215 pm was corrected by about 
630 pm for most of the nation however service in areas near the 
severed cable was still reported spotty late friday 
in addition to affecting phone service private customers whose 
computer networks use atampt phone lines including the associated 
press wire service experienced service problems friday afternoon 
nelson said 
harry baumgartner a spokesman for atampt in basking ridge said 
calls between area codes on the east coast were rerouted by atampts 
computerized network which relays calls along one of 14 lines in 
other parts of the country according to the load on those other 
regional systems 
but not all calls were rerouted successfully many people 
received a fast busy tone or a recording that indicated their call 
could not go through atampt said 
baumgartner said it was impossible to estimate how many millions 
of customers were affected by the problem 
fiber optic cables are composed of hairthin strands of glass 
that carry phone calls and data as pulses of light they can 
transmit many more calls than the traditional copper cables they are 
replacing 
the outage affected new jersey lottery ticket sales lottery 
ticket machines were shut down from 1215 pm until 930 pm 
because of the telephone troubles said lottery spokeswoman sharon 
a southard

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
today accused the united states and pakistan of creating obstacles 
in implementing the accord that provides for the withdrawal of red 
army troops from afghanistan 
pakistan and the united states find it hard to accept new 
approaches to international affairs gorbachev said at a ceremony 
where he received a peace prize named for former prime minister 
indira gandhi 
their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to 
rescind those accords even though the grave consequences of that 
are obvious gorbachev said on the second day of his threeday 
state visit to india 
the soviet union agreed in april to withdraw its estimated 
100000 troops from afghanistan and about half the troops have 
left soviet troops entered in december 1979 and have been helping 
the marxist government battle usbacked moslem guerrillas 
the soviet union and afghanistan accuse pakistan of continuing to 
serve as a conduit for arms to the rebels in violation of the accord 
earlier today gorbachev said a challenge by the soviet republic 
of estonia to kremlin authority was part of the ongoing process of 
perestroika or social change promoted by the soviet leader 
estonias parliament this week declared estonia was sovereign and 
has the right to veto soviet laws 
in his first public reaction to a rise of nationalism in the 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia gorbachev said 
there is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem i am sure 
things will settle down 
the soviet leader also said good relations between the soviet 
union china and india were necessary for peace in the asiapacific 
region 
we are pleased to see signs of improvement in indochinese 
relations he said our own relations with china are also 
evolving in an encouraging way 
thinking of countries like the soviet union india and china 
one is inevitably led to realize that good relations between them 
are extremely important for the destinies of asia and for global 
progress 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi is scheduled to visit beijing 
next month the first indian head of government to visit the country 
in 34 years chinese leader deng xiaoping is scheduled to visit 
moscow early next year 
both india and the soviet union have had longstanding border 
problems with china india and china fought a brief war in 1962 over 
the issue 
gorbachevs comments on the unrest in the baltic states were made 
informally to reporters at a memorial to mrs gandhi which he 
visited before the award ceremony 
gorbachev accompanied by his wife raisa placed a wreath of red 
roses at mrs gandhis memorial he placed similar floral tributes 
at memorials to her father and indias first prime minister 
jawaharlal nehru and to mohandas k gandhi the hero of indias 
freedom movement 
an estimated 7000 afghan refugees many of them opposed to 
soviet military involvement in their homeland were confined to 
their homes in new delhi under police order for a second day one 
police officer said the order was issued to prevent any 
embarrassment to the soviet leader 
the order asked afghans not to move out of your residence till 
211188 noncompliance of the order will render you liable for 
prosecution 
the afghans were also asked to report to nearest police stations 
every morning for a head count the officer said on condition of 
anonymity 
gorbachev has sought to dispel any doubts about the future of 
sovietindian relations in an apparent reference to china 
gorbachev said the development of relations with third countries 
would not affect the kremlins friendly ties with india 
both india and the soviet union have showed signs of easing 
longstanding strains in relations with china prompting concerns 
expressed by some indian newspapers and some indian officials about 
shifts in the political balances in asia

city officials acknowledge there was a 
gap between concrete road barricades on a closed road where a car 
plunged into a river killing all four occupants but they dont 
know if anyone is to blame 
officials said friday they did not know who moved the 2ton 
concrete barriers that would have prevented the car from going into 
the water or when they were pushed apart 
the car was found by police divers in the mill river on thursday 
five days after four young friends from east lyme disappeared during 
a night out in new haven their disappearance prompted a nationwide 
search 
divers searched the river bottom after a patrolman noticed the 
gap wednesday and public works crews closed the opening 
the four victims drowned the state medical examiners office 
said 
police said a case of mostly empty beer cans was found in the 
car but they said they did not know whether the results of 
bloodalcohol tests would be released because they hadnt determined 
who was driving 
police also were checking reports that the four all under the 
legal drinking age of 21 were served alcohol in several bars the 
night they disappeared 
killed in the accident were three 19yearolds laura 
lagrotteria who worked at a pizza parlor jill sawyer a student at 
the university of rhode island and christy stevens a student at 
mohegan community college in norwich and michael gallo 20 a 
student at southern connecticut state university in new haven 
the accident occurred on a dark stretch of road that was closed 
last year because a 105yearold pivoting bridge along it was beyond 
repair the bridge was left in its open position parallel to the 
river so boats could pass by on either side 
mayor biagio dilieto and other city officials told reporters at a 
news conference friday that an investigation had confirmed that the 
concrete road barriers at the open bridge had been moved leaving a 
gap wide enough for a car to pass through 
one or more of the three 2ton concrete blocks were out of place 
when the car drove into the river city officials said 
the officials claim that they had received no public complaints 
about a gap in the barricade was disputed by a radio stations 
traffic reporter who said he passed on complaints from motorists 
several times since march 
police found the blocks out of position after an oct 22 car 
accident at the site but city officials said they were not sure how 
big a gap existed at that time the accident was the third at the 
barriers since the bridge was closed in august 1987 
city officials said they are investigating why public works crews 
put up wooden barriers after the oct 22 accident instead of 
returning the blocks to their original position two barrier 
stanchions were recovered from the river 
authorities also are investigating whether a detour sign was 
incorrectly placed to send traffic down the closed street the night 
of the crash the sign was found in the incorrect position thursday

president hosni mubarak said today that egypt 
recognizes the newly proclaimed palestinian state and that plo 
leader yasser arafat will visit cairo for talks on middle east peace 
strategy 
mubaraks announcement brought the number of countries 
recognizing an independent palestinian nation to 32 
it was not immediately known whether the egyptian recognition 
would lead to diplomatic relations and the establishment of a 
palestinian embassy in cairo 
the plo has an office in cairo but its mission is listed in the 
foreign ministrys diplomatic list in an annex separate from embassy 
listings the head of the mission is not an ambassador and does not 
present credentials to the president 
egyptian recognition was certain to irritate israel which has 
diplomatic relations with egypt under their 1979 peace treaty the 
only one between an arab country and the jewish state israel 
reacted angrily to recognition of the palestinian state by turkey 
this week 
israel today had no immediate reaction to mubaraks remarks a 
foreign ministry official said the reports from cairo would be 
checked before any response was made 
israel has mounted a diplomatic offensive against international 
recognition of the palestinian state foreign minister shimon peres 
kicked it off friday in a meeting with 60 diplomats from 42 
countries 
the palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile and 
the policymaking body of the palestine liberation organization 
declared an independent palestinian homeland at its meeting in 
algiers 
the independence declaration did not define the boundaries of the 
future state saying it would be determined by future negotiations 
col saeed moussa a syrianbacked palestinian leader has called 
for the creation of new plo to replace arafats capitulationist 
command a beirut newspaper reported today 
moussa better known by the codename of abu moussa was quoted 
by the independent daily annahar as saying the councils 
recognition of un security council resolutions 242 and 338 was 
tantamount to treason 
the resolutions carry implicit recognition of israel moussa 
was quoted as saying 
a new plo command moussa was quoted as saying will carry out 
the armed struggle against the zionist enemy israel until our 
homeland is liberated 
moussa broke from arafats plo in 1983 and set up headquarters 
for his fatahuprising faction in the syrian capital 
mubaraks statement appeared to upgrade two previous official 
position statements which expressed support for the palestinian 
state and termed the endorsement stronger than recognition 
some countries cast doubts on our position when we said that we 
supported the resolutions of the palestine national council and said 
we did not recognize the palestinian state mubarak said in the 
nile delta city of benha 
this is our cause we are saying that we supported all the 
councils resolutions and this includes recognition of the 
palestinian state 
there was no explanation of the upgrading today of cairos 
position to explicit recognition 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin told israel television 
last wednesday that if egypt recognized the palestinian state it 
would be deviating from the camp david peace framework accords 
concluded with israel 
the usmediated camp david agreements provided for negotiations 
to determine the final status of the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza where about 15 million palestinians live rabin said 
unilateral action would breach that aspect of the accords 
mubarak said i shall hear from yasser arafat about details of 
the palestinian councils resolutions when he visits cairo we also 
will discuss future steps 
egyptian newspapers reported arafat was expected in cairo today 
for the opening of a fiveday symposium on protection of religious 
shrines and cultural heritage in palestine 
abdullah alhourani a member of the plo executive committee who 
is attending the symposium told reporters arafat was unable to 
arrive in time for the opening session but hoped to come within 
the next few days 
the nations to have recognized the palestinian state are 
afghanistan algeria bahrain bangladesh cuba cyprus egypt 
gambia india indonesia iraq jordan kuwait lebanon libya 
madagascar malaysia mauritania morocco nicaragua north and 
south yemen qatar pakistan saudi arabia senegal singapore 
sudan tunisia turkey the united arab emirates and yugoslavia

the b1b bomber that crashed at ellsworth 
air force base had passed a threehour inspection ordered for the 
fleet after another b1b bomber crashed in texas air force 
officials said 
brig gen robert marquette jr said thursdays crash probably 
will not force another grounding of the nations fleet of advanced 
jet bombers 
marquette commander of the 12th air division at ellsworth said 
friday that a permanent team is being assembled to study the crash 
the four crewmen parachuted to safety thursday night but the 
280 million plane was destroyed after smashing onto a runway at 
ellsworth during a routine training flight one crew member suffered 
a back injury 
the crew is in relatively good shape marquette said 
thursdays crash came two days after officials reported that the 
air force had inspected and cleared more than twothirds of the 98 
b1b bombers which were grounded briefly after the nov 8 crash 
that destroyed a plane in texas 
the plane that crashed thursday was cleared for flight on monday 
marquette said air operations at ellsworth have been suspended 
until the debris has been fully examined 
marquette refused to speculate on the cause of the crash but 
said there was no evidence of an engine fire 
the bomber was trying to land when it crashed at 1040 pm 
toppling a utility pole that cut off power to two schools and a 
residential area 
the washington post in todays editions quoted sources as 
saying preliminary reports indicated the pilot misjudged his 
approach and was preparing to land far short of the ellsworth 
runway the papers sources said it was unclear whether the 
miscalculation resulted from a human error or a malfunction in the 
bombers sophisticated flight aid systems 
the newspapers sources said the pilot realizing a crash was 
imminent pulled the nose of the plane up giving the crew time to 
eject safely 
the post also reported that sources said initial reports 
suggested that the b1b crash in texas was caused by a broken fuel 
line that spewed fuel over the engine causing it to burst into 
flames

about two dozen if you have 19800 light bulbs the parks 
department here found out 
to light up the citys new westlake park for the holidays the 
department ordered 792 strings of christmas lights each with 25

thousands of protesters shouting 
execute chun doohwan were dispersed by riot police firing tear 
gas today as they marched through the city to denounce the former 
president 
fighting began when riot police in green combat fatigues and 
black visored helmets blocked 5000 dissidents students and 
workers who tried to march after a rally to call for chuns 
punishment for alleged corruption 
students tried to force their way through police lines and 
troopers used tear gas grenades to drive them back screaming 
protesters then pelted police with hundreds of firebombs and showers 
of rocks 
arrest chun doohwan oust president roh taewoo 
protesters yelled as they battled unsucessfully to break through 
police lines 
protesters later reassembled in the center of seoul where columns 
of marchers paraded through the streets with banners and flags 
yelling slogans and shooting their fists into the air 
yonhap the south korean news agency estimated 12000 people 
took part in the protests peaceful antichun rallies were held in 
the provincial cities of chongju kwangju taego and chonju 
some protesters in seoul yelled antiamerican slogans charging 
the united states had backed military rule in south korea yankee 
go home they yelled 
riot police lining the streets intervened when thousands of 
protesters tried to approach city hall police armored vans with 
multiple tear gas launchers fired volleys of canisters into the 
marchers sending people running to escape the choking fumes 
students with firebombs and rocks attacked police buses trying 
to set them on fire before troopers drove them off other protesters 
tore up sidewalk paving stones to make rocks to throw at police and 
hurled firebombs 
other large columns of protesters marched in other parts of the 
city center skirmishing a few times with police 
authorities fielded 15000 riot police in seoul after dissident 
groups called for nationwide protests to demand the arrest of chun 
the former president has been accused of corruption and human rights 
abuses and some of his associates and relatives have been convicted 
or charged 
dissident leaders also called for the overthrow of president roh 
charging his government was a front for continued military rule 
police had no word on arrests or injuries today 
some onlookers cheered and applauded the protesters in seoul but 
most people just watched silently as marchers passed by shouting 
antigovernment slogans and singing radical songs 
on friday aides of the former president said chun will 
apologize give most of his wealth to the government and leave seoul 
in an effort to quiet public protests about his alleged involvement 
in corruption 
a fourday parliamentary hearing opened into chuns role in the 
bloody suppression of an uprising in the southern city of kwangju in 
1980 
one aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the former 
president would announce his decision at a news conference next 
week he will make a public apology give up most of his wealth 
and live in seclusion somewhere in the countryside the aide said 
another said chun would live in an isolated rented house in 
central south korea instead of going to his hometown in the south 
where he is no longer welcome living in rural seclusion is a 
traditional way of repentance for disgraced korean leaders 
the masscirculation paper hankook ilbo quoting an unidentified 
government source said roh is expected to pardon him if chun 
carries out the plan 
nine members of chuns family including two brothers have been 
arrested on corruption charges chun is accused of amassing a 
fortune and sending some of it for investment in the united states 
and australia 
his wealth is not known but one estimate has put it at 6 
million including a 14 million home in seoul

small plane crashes in new york texas and arkansas killed 12 
people including seven who died when a twinengine plane crashed as 
it tried to land in a heavy thunderstorm in batesville ark 
in addition lightning struck a twa jetliner 50 miles from little 
rock arks airport friday and a huge fuel spill at san 
franciscos airport forced delays and diversions for hundreds of 
flights 
roger williams a dispatcher for the independence county 
sheriffs department in arkansas said the beechcraft king air 
turboprop had made one approach and missed the batesville airport 
and they were attempting a second time when it crashed just after 
6 pm friday about 12 miles west of the airport the remote crash 
site is some 90 miles northeast of little rock 
the flight originated at orange texas outside houston said 
wayne beckmann duty officer at the federal aviation 
administrations southwest regional office in fort worth 
arkansas was under a flash flood watch when the crash occurred 
during a heavy thunderstorm 
the weather was about as bad as you can get williams said 
the officers at the scene said it was raining and so foggy you 
couldnt see the ground 
the identities of the victims were not immediately released 
elsewhere three people were killed when a singleengine 
beechcraft bonanza apparently lost power shortly after takeoff from

the operator of the seabrook nuclear power 
plant says president reagans order allowing a federal agency to 
devise evacuation plans for such plants comes too late to help that 
troubled plant get a license 
but seabrook critics think the executive order will give 
utilitywritten evacuation plans the authority they now lack 
the order signed friday by reagan allows the federal emergency 
management agency to develop and carry out evacution plans for 
nuclear plants when state and local governments refuse to cooperate 
in the emergency planning 
the 57 billion seabrook project completed two years has been 
unable to win a commercial license due to opposition from 
neighboring massachusetts where six communities fall within 
seabrooks 10mile evacuation zone 
seabrook officials said friday the order does not affect the 
plant because it already received federal permission to submit its 
own evacuation plans for the massachusetts communities 
we just find it hard to believe that theres much in this plan 
that would help us right now maybe it would have two years ago 
said ron sher a spokesman for new hampshire yankee seabrooks 
operator 
but paul mceachern a longtime seabrook foe and the unsuccessful 
democratic gubernatorial candidate this year said the major flaw in 
utilitysubmitted plans is that utilities lack the authority to 
effectively carry them out the order however gives fema that 
authority he said 
it fills that very large gap thats left with utilitysponsored 
plans mceachern said public service company of new hampshire 
seabrooks lead owner doesnt have police powers in the state of 
massachusetts fema can be empowered by the president for that 
the executive order was received skeptically by the dukakis 
administration in massachusetts which maintains that local 
governments are best able to answer citizens concerns about nuclear 
safety 
we cant comment specifically on the order because we havent 
seen it but our position has been and continues to be that it is 
state and local officials who know how to best protect our 
citizens martie barnes a spokeswoman for gov michael s 
dukakis said friday in boston 
mceachern speculated that the reagan administration anticipated 
the legal challenge to seabrooks evacuation plans by massachusetts 
including the states argument that seabrooks owners lack the 
authority to execute the plans 
he wouldnt have signed the executive order unless he had to 
because its going to be met with hostility from the new hampshire 
delegation mceachern said 
govelect judd gregg an outgoing congressman and sen gordon 
humphrey rnh strongly opposed the order when it came to light 
earlier this year neither returned telephone calls seeking comment 
friday night 
rep robert smith rnh said the final version seems slightly 
weaker than the wording in the original draft much more 
conciliatory he said he supports the thrust of the order because 
he feels the federal government must step in when state or local 
governments try to block a plants licensing 
another seabrook critic jane doughty of the seacoast 
antipollution league predicted a legal battle over the order 
im sure the intervenors in the seabrook case will do 
something about it because congress did not change the laws and 
clearly they did not intend that the federal government should usurp 
state and local planning she said 
until recently states were required to submit an acceptable 
evacuation plan as part of the nrc licensing process because of 
opposition to seabrook by massachusetts and to the shoreham plant on 
long island by new york govmario cuomo the nrc has accepted but 
not approved evacuation plans for both plants written by their 
utility owners both plans face legal challenges 
shoreham was completed in 1984 but never received a commercial 
operating license because of the dispute over the evacuation plan 
in the face of that its builder the long island lighting co 
last spring reached a preliminary agreement with the state to 
abandon the plant in return for the states approval of a 
compensation plan for the utility that plan awaits action by the 
new york legislature 
jerry mikorenda a spokesman for lilco said reagans order 
resolves questions of legal authority and reaffirms our 
position though he said the utility will continue with its plan 
to sell and close the plant 
terry lynam spokesman for new york gov mario cuomo said the 
governor was not surprised by the order because the reagan 
administration is determined to get the plant open cuomo is 
opposed to the licensing of shoreham 
lynam said cuomo made his opposition to the pending executive 
order known in an aug 4 letter to reagan

from a plane crash described as an 
uncontrolled contact with the ground to a patients death called 
a diagnostic misadventure of high magnitude the nations 
english teachers have recognized the years worst doublespeak 
were corrupting what language is supposed to do and thats 
communicate said william lutz who headed the public doublespeak 
committiee of the national council of teachers of english based in 
urbana ill we cannot function without language 
first prize in the 1988 doublespeak awards went to us military 
officials for their explanations of the july 3 downing of an iranian 
airliner by the uss vincennes in the persian gulf 
lutz said that both official reports and a news conference on the 
incident were filled with the doublespeak of omission distortion 
contradiction and misdirection 
the report censored essential information and did not contain 
something as basic and important as a map showing the course over 
time of the vincennes its sister ships the iranian airliner and 
the gunboats 
even so secretary of defense frank carlucci told the public 
we chose not to withhold anything said lutz 
an anonymous reagan administration official captured second place 
for denying that the administration had covered up honduran military 
officials involvement in drug crimes 
the spokesman said it wasnt that there was a coverup its 
just that people knew certain questions shouldnt be asked 
third place went to sen orrin hatch rutah for his statement 
that capital punishment is our societys recognition of the 
sanctity of human life 
the 5000 workers at a chrysler amc plant may have thought a new 
career alternative enhancement program had an enticing ring to 
it until they found out their plant was closing and they were out 
of jobs 
though nearly impossible to pick a favorite doublespeak lutz 
said a stockbrokers description of the october 1987 crash as a 
fourth quarter equity retreat deserved recognition for sheer 
chutzpah 
he also mentioned the us department of agricultures 
description of cows pigs and chickens as grainconsuming animal 
units and a department stores description of a security 
policeman as a loss prevention specialist 
while some examples of doublespeak are funny others deal with 
deadly serious topics 
in philadelphia doctors at a hospital later closed for gross 
mismanagement described one patients death as a diagnostic 
misadventure of a high magnitude 
they killed the guy said lutz a professor at rutgers 
university they perforated his colon and he died 
doublespeak allows officials to talk about something without 
really talking about it said lutz 
im just overwhelmed by the stuff he said its coming in 
waves im getting so much i cant even print it all 
he advised the public to fight back 
reject it what do you do when you buy a toaster and its 
broken take it back think of yourself as a consumer of language

hundreds of thousands of chanting 
serbs rallied today to back demands by their ambitious communist 
party leader slobodan milosevic for more control over the troubled 
southern province of kosovo 
we will not give up kosovo the massive crowd chanted as 
milosevic and other speakers denounced the alleged nationalism of 
kosovos ethnic albanian majority and indirectly attacked other 
opponents of the serbian leader 
in pristina kosovos capital tens of thousands of ethnic 
albanians defied appeals from provincial and national communist 
party leaders to stay home and roamed city streets shaking their 
fists and chanting antimilosevic slogans 
it was the third straight day of street protest in pristina 
where trouble began thursday after pressure from milosevic forced 
the resignation of two of the most popular communist leaders from 
kosovos ethnic albanian majority 
one of the ousted leaders azem vlasi met at least 20000 
students and workers gathered in a pristina sports hall and begged 
them to return home 
without azem there will be no unity chanted the crowds in 
the streets outside we too are the people the protesters 
shouted challenging milosevics claim that rallies backing his 
demands represent the popular will 
the apparently organized shows of strength by both sides in the 
longsimmering dispute over kosovo culminated in todays belgrade 
rally the biggest of dozens orchestrated by milosevic supporters in 
recent months 
no power can halt the fight for kosovo started by the 
rallies milosevic told the cheering belgrade crowd 
we enter this battle as we enter all battles to win he 
proclaimed 
organizers claimed 13 million people converged on belgrade for 
the rally which milosevic called the biggest gathering in the city 
since hundreds of thousands of people celebrated liberation from the 
nazis on oct 20 1944 
belgrade television put the figure at 800000 while foreign 
observers said the number was considerably lower police had no 
immediate estimate 
milosevic who told foreign reporters todays rally was very 
important is pressing for changes in the 1974 constitution which 
gave kosovo broad autonomy the serbian leader argues this is the 
only way to protect kosovos serb and montenegrin minority against 
alleged harassment from the ethnic albanian majority in the 
province which borders communist albania and was the heart of 
serbias medieval empire 
serbs also frequently claim that the ethnic albanians want to 
unite with neighboring communist albania 
chants of slobo slobo slobodo resounded through the crowd 
on the banks of the sava river as milosevic appeared at the rally on 
a giant tribune flanked by serbian and yugoslav national flags and 
topped with a portrait of communist yugoslavias founding father 
josip broz tito 
slobo is short for milosevics first name while slobodo 
means freedom in serbian 
to his supporters milosevic is the second tito the strong 
leader yugoslavia needs to guide it out of political and economic 
crisis 
critics fear milosevics drive for more serbian control over 
kosovo will lead to an increased serbian dominance in the country 
which is a loose federation of six republics and serbias provinces 
of kosovo and vojvodina 
in a 15minute speech that ended the 90minute rally milosevic 
invoked powerful memories of serbias victorious struggles against 
the germans in world war i and world war ii and compared these to 
the current struggle for kosovo 
but he also appealed twice to kosovos ethnic albanians to 
unite against evil and hatred against chauvinists who shame 
their people and to share in the peaceful dream of a kosovo 
where children from the ethnic albanian majority and serb minority 
could play together in peace 
milosevic also made a strong pitch for a series of economic and 
political reforms the communist party leadership has designed to try 
to solve an unprecedented economic crisis that has helped fuel the 
recent ethnic unrest 
columns of wellmarshaled demonstrators waving flags chanting 
slogans and singing nationalist serbian songs moved through 
belgrades city center from the early morning at least 50000 were 
brought in on free trains and buses 
free food and warm drinks were handed out to participants who 
also had free kindergartens available for their children 
there also were strong if indirect attacks on the liberal 
northern republic of slovenia whose communist party leaders have 
accused milosevic of using neostalinist tactics to whip up popular 
support for his policies 
people who denounce the armed forces or serbian policies are 
antiyugoslav said belgrade communist party leader rados 
smilkovic in a broadside at the slovene leadership 
there has been vocal criticism of the army in slovenia

america the national assembly elected wednesday is the lower 
house of parliament

senate or upper house of parliament the national assembly and the 
four provincial assemblies form the electoral college to elect the 
president the provinces also provide the power base for the federal 
government in islamabad 
results of todays elections will not be known until sunday but 
observers predicted local and ethnic parties would emerge strongly 
ms bhuttos leftleaning pakistan peoples party is strongest in 
the populous provinces of sind and punjab but parties such as the

the us trade representative clayton 
yeutter said today he failed to persuade eec officials to cancel a 
ban on imports of hormonetreated meat from the united states 
beginning in 1989 
he reiterated that if the ban takes effect on jan 1 as scheduled 
the united states will retaliate against eec imports 
we should never consider the door closed yeutter said 
but i saw nothing in those talks yesterday that would indicate 
that there was any hope of having the ban delayed 
he and us agriculture secretary richard lyng talked to 
reporters after discussing the proposed meat ban and other 
transatlantic trade issues friday and today with officials at the 
european economic community head office 
yeutter also criticized proposed west german subsidies for 
daimlerbenz ag to protect it from foreign exchange risks due to its 
assumption of a stake in airbus industrie sa the european aircraft 
consortium 
we believe that sets a very unfortunate precedent companies 
should cover their own exchange rate risk he said 
daimlerbenz has approved a government proposal that it take a 30 
percent stake in messerschmittboelkowblohm gmbh a 
statecontrolled aerospace company in return bonn will give up to 
43 billion deutsche marks 24 billion in subsidies to protect 
daimlerbenz against foreign exchange risks resulting from mbbs 
379 percent stake in airbus 
we are exceedingly displeased that exchange rate guarantees 
were given yeutter said if west germany begins to provide 
exchange rate guarantees to its business firms there will be great 
pressure on its government and on other governments to provide 
corresponding exchange rate guarantees 
the eec commission has yet to examine if the subsidies breach the 
eecs antitrust rules 
on jan 1 the common market will ban imports of meat treated 
with growthboosting hormones arguing the use of hormones causes 
cancer yeutter and lyng said there is no scientific evidence for 
the ban on health grounds 
the ban has been delayed by a year to allow for a compromise 
solution which has not emerged if the ban remains the united 
states will retaliate against the eec yeutter said retaliation 
might be reduced if the common market exempts from its ban imports 
of hormonetreated meat used as pet food 
if the eec wishes to exempt pet food we would be pleased 
with that outcome that would not resolve the fundamental issue but 
it would reduce the amount of retaliation 
us retaliation would affect 100 million dollars of eec exports 
to the united states of among other items meat instant coffee 
tomatoes fruit juices and lowalcohol beverages 
that matches the value of meat the eec imports from the united 
states annually if pet food were exempted retaliation could be cut 
to 85 million worth of common market exports yeutter said the eec 
ban was imposed under pressure from consumer groups and the european 
parliament

rebel leader jonas savimbi says his 
antimarxist guerrillas and cuban forces in angola are observing an 
informal ceasefire and conducting negotiations while awaiting the 
outcome of regional peace talks 
savimbi told reporters at his bush headquarters friday that a 
delegation of his national union for the total independence of 
angola or unita met aug 26 in the ivory coast with 
representatives of cuban president fidel castro 
unita is backed by the united states and south africa 
the purpose of the talks was to turn over two of the 17 cuban 
officers captured by unita during fighting against angolas 
cubanand sovietbacked marxist government but savimbi said the 
delegates also arranged a tacit understanding that if we dont 
harass them they wont attack us 
later in an interview with the associated press savimbi said he 
has agreed to a us proposal to provide food to civilians on the 
government side of the angolan civil war the guerrilla leader said 
his only condition is that americans should be allowed into northern 
angola to make sure the food goers to civilians and not government 
soldiers 
savimbi said presidentelect george bush had promised him before 
and after the us election that american support to unita would 
continue until the soviets stop supplying the government and 50000 
cuban troops leave the nation at the news conference savimbi said 
castro has asked for a further meeting at which a system of 
communications will be discussed so that unita guerrillas know if 
cubans are part of a government convoy and can avoid attacking them 
he said cubans have not attacked his forces for some time but 
claimed soviet personnel had engaged in fighting 
the cubans are staying behind they are not playing a major 
role they are not visible said savimbi 
he also said south african president pw botha had invited him 
to a meeting in pretoria on wednesday to discuss a usmediated 
peace plan designed to get cuban troops out of angola and end south 
african rule over southwest africa also known as namibia on 
friday the angolan and cuban governments formally approved the 
tentative peace accord south africas cabinet is expected to 
discuss the matter in a few days 
negotiators from angola cuba and south africa under us 
mediation agreed tuesday in geneva to submit a timetable to their 
respective governments for the redeployment to the north of the 
country and ultimate pullout of the cuban troops south africa says 
agreement on a cuban withdrawal is a precondition for allowing 
independence for namibia 
savimbi said he did not care how long the cubans take to leave 
as long as they all go he is confident that without cuban support 
the marxist angolan forces would have no choice but to negotiate 
with him on a reconciliation government leading to free elections 
which he believes he would win 
savimbi said that unlike antigovernment rebels in afghanistan 
who have attacked the retreating soviet army his rebels would leave 
departing cuban troops alone the best victory is to allow the 
enemy to go savimbi said 
unita has been fighting for a share of power since shortly after 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
the groups intelligence chief gen peregrino wambo said that 
in the past month 48 unita soldiers had died while the angolan 
government has lost 531 men and the cubans 12

a soviet parliamentary commission today said 
estonias declaration of sovereignty runs counter to the 
constitution in a ruling that could set the stage for a kremlin 
annulment of the baltic republics action 
in lithuania another soviet republic on the baltic coast 
activists seeking more autonomy met to decide how to react to a 
decision by local lawmakers not to directly challenge moscows 
control one activist said 
in an apparent kremlin effort to reassure the countrys 15 
constituent republics the council of ministers met with their 
representatives on economic powersharing official radio moscow 
reported today 
in india president mikhail s gorbachev said this weeks 
challenge to kremlin authority by estonia was part of the process of 
perestroika the name he has given his campaign for social and 
economic reform 
but a special commission of the moscowbased supreme soviet 
parliament that met today to discuss questions of constitutional and 
political reform reacted strongly to estonias decision calling it 
unconstititional 
the commission ruled that decisions adopted at wednesdays 
session of estonias parliament contain a range of provisions that 
contradict the norms of the constitution of the ussr on which 
the soviet socialist federation is founded the official tass news 
agency said 
tass said the commissions conclusions were transmitted to the 
supreme soviet presidium the nations top collegial executive body 
that is headed by gorbachev in a move that could presage a striking 
down of the estonian decisions by the national leadership 
gorbachev spoke in new delhi on the second day of a threeday 
state visit to india it was his first public reaction to a surge of 
nationalism in estonia and the two other baltic republics lithuania 
and latvia 
there is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem he 
said the country is thinking over what is happening many 
points are considered but not all are constructive gorbachev 
said some are purely emotional and this has been causing some 
negative reactions 
but he added what is happening in estonia is perestroika 
the estonian parliament on wednesday passed a declaration of 
sovereignty in all but foreign and defense matters and a 
constitutional amendment giving its own parliament the right to veto 
soviet laws 
the council of ministers led by premier nikolai i ryzhkov met 
friday with the officials from the soviet unions 15 constituent 
republics radio moscow said speakers said a new economic 
machinery must ensure a balanced combination of each republic and of 
the nation in general the radio said 
the council set up a special commission to draw up guidelines for 
reforming economic and social management between the central 
government and the republics radio moscow said

front and some newspapers in latvia of of seeking nationalist 
isolation and separation 
lithuanias parliament on friday approved a measure making 
lithuanian the official language of the republic and embracing as 
its flag that of presoviet independent lithuania 
but the legislators dropped a proposal for limited sovereignty 
without a vote after the republics party leader said estonias 
declaration violated the soviet constitution official media 
reported 
people were scandalized when parliament dropped the 
sovereignty plan without a vote said one activist who stood on the 
square outside all day listening to the live radio broadcast of the 
parliament meeting 
the people trusted them and then they didnt even vote said 
the activist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the lithuanian communist party chief algirdas 
brazauskas returned from moscow the night before the meeting and 
told deputies they had no reason to confront moscow when estonia 
already had lost the battle over sovereignty 
the soviet presidium said thursday that estonias claim of veto 
power over soviet laws conflicted with the soviet constitution and 
that the issue would be discussed with estonian leaders at the next 
meeting of the national presidium no date was given 
in recent months thousands of people in the baltic republics 
have joined grassroots movements and have tried to use gorbachevs 
programs of social reforms as justification for their demands 
the three republics were independent after the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution until 1940 they were absorbed by the soviet union at 
that time under a secret agreement between dictators josef stalin of 
the soviet union and adolf hitler of nazi germany

opec oil ministers today pressed for a 
compromise between iran and iraq that would allow the ministers to 
draw up a new production agreement and raise crude prices 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh held secret morning 
talks with other ministers of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries at a luxurious hotel in vienna 
he spoke only briefly to reporters as he entered a hotel elevator 
to go to his meeting with nigerian oil minister rilwanu lukman and 
other officials lukman also is president of the cartel asked if 
there were any new developments aghazadeh replied maybe 
aghazadeh and issam abdul raheem alchalabi the oil chief of 
rival iraq met separately on friday with other opec members to try 
to break an impasse that has stalled cartel talks 
the ministers were scheduled later today to resume formal 
discussions in a joint session of two of the cartels committees 
on friday aghazadeh told reporters that iran refuses an iraqi 
demand that the two rival countries be allowed to produce an equal 
amount of oil under a new cartel accord i always reject parity 
he said the two nations are trying to rebuild after an eightyear 
war that ended in august 
the dispute between iran and iraq over oil production has stalled 
efforts to draw up new production ceilings that would limit the 
recent surge in output and give a lift to sagging oil prices 
also taking part in the behindthescenes negotiations today were 
oil ministers rilwanu lukman of nigeria julio cesar gil of 
venezuela hisham nazer of saudi arabia and ali khalifa alsabah of 
kuwait 
indonesian energy minister ginandjar kartasasmita gave the talks 
a 5050 chance of success 
the ministers also met for about an hour thursday evening in a 
joint session of two cartel committees officials said 
officials fear that failure to draw up a new accord will send 
crude prices into a tailspin if cheating continues to add millions 
of barrels of oil a day to an already glutted world market 
prices are running 4 or more below the cartels benchmark of 18 
a barrel 
analysts estimate iraq has been producing at least 26 million 
barrels a day an amount that could hit 37 million barrels next 
year with completion of a new pipeline through saudi arabia to the 
red sea its quota under a 1986 agreement was 15 million barrels a 
day 
saudi arabia has widened its output to more than 6 million 
barrels a day analysts estimate well above its daily quota of 43 
million barrels 
iran also is believed to have exceeded its quota of 24 million 
barrels 
iraq in the past has refused to abide by the opec quota of 1986 
saying it wanted the same level given iran iran has argued against 
granting iraq an equal share 
iraq had said during an opec meeting last month in madrid spain 
that it would not accept a ceiling that was a barrel less than 
irans

president hosni mubarak today reaffirmed 
support for an independent palestinian state but again stopped short 
of fully recognizing the newly proclaimed nation 
the stateowned middle east news agency initially quoted mubarak 
as expressing egypts recognition of the palestinian state 
later it amended its report saying the word recognition was 
incorrect and that mubarak had only declared support for the 
establishment of the state 
there was a mistake on the desk here said adel amer an 
assistant editor at the agency he refused to elaborate 
the palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
proclaimed an independent state tuesday at the end of a meeting in 
algiers algeria 
that afternoon an egyptian government statement endorsed but did 
not explicitly recognize the palestinian state on thursday mubarak 
stuck to the support formula but said it was stronger than 
recognition 
at least 31 other nations mainly moslem have recognized the 
palestinian state and the soviet union has recognized the 
proclamation while stopping short of full diplomatic recognition 
in the original remarks reported by the middle east news agency 
mubarak was quoted as saying 
some countries cast doubts on our position when we said that we 
supported the resolutions of the palestine national council they 
said that we did not recognize the palestinian state this is our 
palestinian cause we are saying that we supported all the 
councils resolutions and this includes recognition of the 
palestinian state 
in its amended version the news agency twice substituted the 
word establishment for the word recognition changing the 
meaning of the sentence to an expression of support for the 
palestinian state 
a few hours after mubarak spoke today foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid met with arab ambassadors in cairo in remarks to 
reporters afterward he again characterized egypts position on the 
palestinian state as one of support 
egypt and israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 the only one 
between an arab country and the jewish state 
israel has mounted a diplomatic offensive against international 
recognition of the palestinian state foreign minister shimon peres 
kicked it off friday in a meeting with 60 diplomats from 42 
countries 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin told israel television on 
wednesday night that if egypt recognized the palestinian state it 
would be deviating from the 1978 camp david peace framework 
accords concluded with israel 
the usmediated camp david agreements provided for negotiations 
to determine the final status of the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza where 15 million palestinians live rabin said unilateral 
action would breach that aspect of the accords 
mubarak said today that the palestine national council took 
very good decisions in accepting un security council 
resolutions 242 and 338 
all of these are excellent advanced steps and should be 
exploited in the forward push to settle the palestinian problem 
he said 
resolution 242 implicitly recognizes israels right to live in 
peace within secure boundaries resolution 338 called for peace 
negotiations under appropriate auspices and was the basis of a 
proposal strongly supported by the arabs for an international 
conference 
mubarak said plo chief yasser arafat would soon arrive in cairo 
for talks 
i shall hear from yasser arafat about details of the 
palestinian councils resolutions when he visits cairo we also will 
discuss future steps mubarak said he did not say when the plo 
chairman will arrive 
the nations to have recognized the palestinian state are 
afghanistan algeria bahrain bangladesh cuba cyprus gambia 
india indonesia iraq jordan kuwait lebanon libya madagascar 
malaysia mauritania morocco nicaragua north and south yemen 
qatar pakistan saudi arabia senegal singapore sudan tunisia

death of russell rusty nies iii 26 of new cumberland nies 
died june 20 two days after the beating in a hallway outside 
troups apartment 
the two had fought over the return of property to a sister of 
nies fiancee defense attorney floyd p jones said nies had 
threatened troup and wanted to fight 
troup did nothing more than you or i would do to defend 
ourselves and protect our property jones said in closing 
arguments 
marc a roberts assistant district attorney argued troup went 
beyond selfdefense by continuing to strike nies with the guitar 
after he had been knocked down by the initial blow 
selfdefense changed to pure rage and the intent to kill 
roberts said 
six or seven additional blows by troup two of which shattered 
the back of the victims skull were neither necessary nor 
reasonable roberts said 
troup still faces unspecified criminal charges as a juvenile

people in this arctic town had a few 
minutes to catch a glimpse of the sun saturday before it disappeared 
for 65 days leaving barrow in virtual darkness 
the sun rose at 104 pm and set 16 minutes later it will 
appear again on jan 23 at 109 pm 
temperatures already have been well below zero in barrow and the 
absence of the sun wont make the community of 1500 residents much 
colder feeble solar radiation during the arctic autumn is no match 
for the cooling effects of permafrost ice and snow said chuck 
evans manager of the us weather service station here 
people dont seem disturbed about the long periods of darkness 
evans said 
weve had a lot of them come up and worry about it the first 
year he said but so far its not really affected anyone 
but he said the lack of light can restrict weather station 
operations for one thing its hard to observe cloud movements when 
it is dark 
darkness causes some people to suffer a malady known as seasonal 
affective disorder or sad with symptoms including lethargy 
inability to concentrate depression and increased appetite said 
north slope borough health department spokeswoman mary oconnor 
in the soviet union officials send children from dark areas to 
brighter regions for at least a week during the winter soviet 
children also are exposed to fullspectrum lighting for at least 10 
minutes a day she said 
people unable to escape the darkness can be helped by certain 
colors oconnor said 
yellow is more up an energizing color she said but blue 
tends to have a tranquilizing effect 
while some people in barrow use tips about colors and fill their 
homes with potted plants to help them deal with the darkness others 
say the winter conditions are a way of life and require no 
adjustment 
after seeing the sun set like that for 74 years what more can 
i say said maggie gray a barrow elder she goes about her daily 
rounds whether its light or dark outside

voting proceeded without violence today 
in the provincial election in eastern sri lanka where tamil 
guerrillas had threatened to disrupt balloting officials and 
residents reported 
lakshman perera a deputy election commissioner said no violent 
incidents had been reported he said about 40 percent of the 600000 
people eligible to vote cast their ballots 
indian and sri lankan soldiers maintained heavy security around 
polling centers to ward off possible attacks by the guerrillas 
two indian soldiers were killed friday night when tamil gunmen 
attacked four police stations in the east a sri lankan military 
spokesman said 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said the attacks were an attempt to disrupt todays elections the 
police stations were manned jointly by sri lankan forces and members 
of indias peacekeeping force 
residents of batticaloa the provincial capital said voter 
turnout was poor in the morning but picked up later 
batticaloa 136 miles east of colombo is in the heart of an area 
that has been a constant flashpoint in the fiveyear tamil 
separatist war 
the voters are to elect 35 members to a council joining 
multiethnic eastern province with overwhelmingly tamil northern 
province northern province had no election because factions agreed 
last month to apportion the provinces 36 seats all candidates were 
unopposed 
the merged council which will have limited administrative power 
was offered by the national government as an alternative to tamil 
militants demand for a separate nation in the region 
de silva said election results would not be known until sunday 
the largest tamil guerrilla group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam has rejected the elections calling them an indian propaganda 
ploy 
in a telex from their office in london the tigers said the two 
exguerrilla groups in the elections were mercenaries of the 
government of india and can only only be described as traitors 
who will never be forgiven 
the tigers are fighting indian peacekeeping troops who were sent 
to sri lanka in july 1987 to disarm the guerrillas and enforce a 
peace accord 
the most militant tamils say they need a separate state to 
protect their ethnic minority from what they say is discrimination 
by the sinhalese majority 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists comprise 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people tamils make up about 18 percent of the 
population 
most tamils are hindus but in the batticaloa area many are 
christians whose ancestors were converted by western missionaries

in addition to naming advisers at the highest 
levels presidentelect george bush must deal with a federal work 
force of 3 million people that is too often underpaid unmotivated 
and demoralized a congressional report contends 
to a large extent the government today is faced with a people 
problem the general accounting office said in one of a series of 
transition reports directed to bush and house and senate leaders 
concern is mounting that the governments ability to acquire 
and retain good people is diminishing the gao said you get 
what you pay for unfortunately the federal governments pay 
structure has broken down 
the investigative agency of congress also said the war on drugs 
needs stronger leadership and that higher ethical standards must be 
applied to top government officials 
after years of fedbashing the new president needs to change 
course the gao said theodore roosevelt talked of using the 
presidency as a bully pulpit today this kind of leadership is 
needed to invigorate the public service 
the report cited a 1987 governmentwide survey which found that 
many federal managers reported lower motivation levels morale 
is so bad it said that only 13 percent of senior executives said 
they would advise people beginning their careers to enter public 
service 
if the quality of the federal work force is reduced the 
quality of government services and programs is reduced the report 
said 
the bottom line in this situation is not less profit but more 
importantly less effective government services services that 
touch the lives of literally millions of people it said 
the gao said bushs political appointees must adhere to high 
ethical standards and make ethics in government a priority in their 
agencies 
the agency said a minuscule total of more than 500 federal 
workers at all levels was convicted of jobrelated criminal 
violations in 1987 
but numbers are misleading it said when such offenses 
occur especially among higher level officials respect for and 
confide

imagine sacrificing your childrens education 
to pay back a loan you would begin to get an idea of the burden the 
foreign debt places on countries like mexico economists say 
hamstrung by foreign debt payment demands mexicos rate of 
growth has been practically zero the past six years and the economy 
actually will shrink 1 percent this year 
this is the most urgent problem that president carlos salinas 
de gortari will face said a salinas adviser 14 days before the 
new president begins a sixyear term 
those close to salinas say privately he will be emphatic in his 
demand to improve debt servicing terms and possibly reduce the 
principal of mexicos 102 billion debt salinas goal according to 
a document prepared by advisers for his first months in office is 
to get mexico to grow at an annual rate of 5 percent 
salinas and his advisers maintain debt restructuring is a 
necessity if mexico is to resume economic growth 
the first person to hear salinas arguments for restructuring 
will be presidentelect george bush whom salinas will meet tuesday 
in houston it is an indication of salinas concern that he is 
bringing his top economic advisers to the meeting 
mexican officials feel that bush and his top aides including 
incoming secretary of state james baker and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady are men who know the problem of the foreign debt 
well and have an open mind in the words of one salinas aide 
interest and principal payments on the foreign debt long have 
been an economic problem but in mexico suffering through its sixth 
year of financial crisis the payments also have become a political 
problem with a growing opposition demanding the government declare 
a moratorium on interest payments 
in 1988 mexico paid 9 billion in interest on the debt and close 
to 6 billion toward principal on the combined public and private 
debt 
at the same time the government enacted belttightening measures 
and a wage freeze in an attempt to fight inflation 
despite recriminations over the debt crisis and intermittent 
debtor calls for a moratorium on interest payments mexico 
consistently has maintained it intends to fulfill its foreign 
obligations but it is demanding a restructuring of payback terms 
and a more cooperative attitude from creditor nations and banks 
you could stop payments on the debt today if you wanted to a 
salinas adviser said but what are you going to do for the 
financing of your needs tomorrow negotiation is better than 
confrontation 
mexican economists say the governments problem is how to 
compensate debt payments abroad by increasing mexicos income 
through exports loans and investment 
members of salinas economic team say mexico has no intention to 
default on payments but one official warns mexico also must grow 
again in order to survive 
growth is a political and economic imperative said a member 
of salinas advisory group 
we do not want a trench war with the international community 
jose angel gurria a top foreign debt negotiator in the finance 
ministry told an industrial meeting last week but he added 
creditors must understand that we must growwe get the 
financing or we take it 
mexicos income from exports of oil and increasingly 
manufacturing combined with tourism and loans from international 
organizations has helped the country keep up with debt payments 
but this has meant sacrificing desperately needed development 
projects and infrastructural investment 
mexican officials ideal is a reduction of interest on the debt 
or a simple elimination of part of the principal but us banks are 
more reluctant than european banks to accept writeoffs or interest 
rate reductions 
mexican officials feel that if they can persuade the banks to 
accept renegotiations writeoffs or exchanges of debt for bonds 
we will be able to compensate for some of the cash sent abroad 
an aide said

solidarity leader lech walesa said saturday 
that two days of meetings with government officials failed to 
produce agreement on future talks between communist authorities and 
opposition representatives 
walesa met friday and saturday with interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak as part of an effort to set up largescale talks on 
polands future including possible recognition of the solidarity 
trade union federation 
the two sides agreed to continue contacts with the goal of 
bringing their positions closer together the staterun news agency 
pap announced in a dispatch about the same walesa made his comments 
the dispatch was the first government statement on the meetings 
which had been wrapped in secrecy 
we havent come that much closer we hope for political 
decisions because there are none at the moment walesa told 
reporters at warsaw central station before boarding a train back to 
gdansk 
the solidarity leader said he was worn out after the meetings 
with kiszczak the first contacts between walesa and kiszczak since 
sept 16 
walesa refused to say where the meetings were held he said 
archbishop bronislaw dabrowksi served as host 
others at the meeting were gdansk bishop tadeusz goclowski the 
rev alojzy orszulik a church press spokesman tadeusz mazowiecki 
one of walesas closest lay advisers and alternate politburo member 
stanislaw ciosek 
the two meetings took place in an atmosphere of extreme secrecy 
with walesa on friday slipping away from episcopate headquarters in 
warsaw avoiding reporters waiting at various exits 
government church and solidarity spokesmen refused repeated 
requests to confirm the meetings were taking place 
kiszczak three weeks ago asked walesa for a facetoface meeting 
to remove obstacles to longpromised talks with the opposition he 
sent another message to walesa a week ago but neither side has made 
public the contents 
the socalled roundtable talks were promised by the 
government after walesa persuaded workers to end a nationwide strike 
wave in august the strikers main demand was legalization of the 
solidarity trade union federation which was outlawed in 1982 
walesa conferred friday with advisers and officials of the roman 
catholic church before the first meeting with kiszczak 
historian bronislaw geremek a walesa adviser who met with the 
union chief said the only decisive issue still blocking future 
talks was whether the government would show a will to legalize 
solidarity if the government would make a positive sign he said 
then it seems the chance for the roundtable will return

the change involves just a few words in the law 
and would affect a halfdozen people a year 
but indications that israel is about to change its law of return 
to deny automatic citizenship to nonorthodox converts have 
generated enormous controversy among american jews most of whom are 
reform or conservative 
at issue they say is whether these branches of judaism are 
perceived as legitimate at risk they say is the unified support 
of american jewry that has sustained israel through four wars and 
scores of crises 
american jewish efforts on behalf of israel are going to be 
subordinated to the effort to get this changed israel is going to 
be the object of a crusade in which theyre going to be the bad 
guys not the good guys said rabbi eric yoffie executive 
director of the association of reform zionists of america 
twentyseven organizations among them the american jewish 
congress the american jewish committee bnai brith hadassah and 
all major reform and conservative governing bodies issued a 
statement nov 12 warning of the enormous damage actual and 
symbolic to jews living outside of israel 
the vast majority of jews worldwide are nonorthodox even in 
israel 
the council of jewish federations which will raise an estimated 
850 million this year for jewish needs around the world said it 
would dispatch a delegation to israel to lobby against the change 
we are dealing with the perceived disenfranchisement of 
millions of american jews who will feel they have been written 
out said shoshana s cardin past president of the council 
under israeli law as it stands all jews defined as the 
children of a jewish woman or converts are automatically accepted 
as israeli citizens 
for decades ultraorthodox elements in israel have sought to 
change the law so that only those who are converted in accordance 
with halacha the strict orthodox interpretation of jewish law 
are eligible 
support for the orthodox religious parties doubled in this years 
parliamentary elections though that amounted to only 18 seats in 
the 120seat knesset it gave the religious parties enough votes to 
give either the labor or likud blocs the majority needed to form the 
next government 
last week it was reported that the religious parties had agreed 
to support likud and had won numerous concessions including a 
promise to seek a change in the law of return 
unless labor and likud agree to form another unity government 
american jewish leaders fear the change is inevitable it has been 
reported that likud would make a parliamentary vote in favor of the 
change mandatory for party members 
converts such as brenda brooks of hackensack nj recoil at 
this slap in the face to hear i might not be considered a jew 
when i spent years trying to reach that goal really hurts and i 
find it really offensive 
but brooks has no plans to move to israel underscoring the 
issues symbolic nature it is believed that only five or six 
nonorthodox converts apply for israeli citizenship each year 
it is the equivalent of the pledge of allegiance issue in the 
american presidential election said rabbi irving greenberg 
president of the national jewish center for learning and leadership 
it sets jew against jew symbolically conveying that the 
vast majority of jews arent jewish said michael lerner an 
orthodox zionist who is editor of the liberal journal tikkun 
rabbi wolfe kelman executive director of the conservative 
rabbinical assembly predicted many jews will not back israel with 
the same devotion that they had in the past if the law passes 
marty stein chairman of the united jewish appeal said he would 
expect some drop in contributions to israel but i would hope it 
would be very small his group sends 300 million to israel each 
year 
rabbi yehuda krinsky chief spokesman for the ultraorthodox 
lubavitcher sect argued that orthodox conversions are the only ones 
that are universally accepted as valid he drew an analogy to a 
dinner of jewish friends if the food is kosher both the observant 
and nonobservant can eat 
the lubavitcher hasidim have been active in pressing for the 
change plunging into israeli politics though krinsky said he fears 
other jews would reduce their support for israel it would be 
cutting your nose to spite your face

if george bush turns his family 
estate on a seawalled maine peninsula into the next summer white 
house he will follow a 200yearold tradition dating back to the 
nations first president 
since the days of george washington us presidents complete 
with staffs and sometimes with considerable baggage have escaped 
the pressures of the presidency and the oppressive heat of a 
washington summer with respites in the countryside seashore or 
mountains 
advisers always stress that the president get out of the white 
house and away from the kind of craziness that exists there 
says marvin druker a political scientist at the university of 
southern maine in portland 
theyve always been criticized for being out of washington for 
extended periods of time druker continued but such trips give 
the president a break from the pressures of the job and a chance to 
gain a new perspective on problemsolving 
if tradition is followed bushs ninebedroom family home in this 
maine resort town population 4500 is the most likely choice as 
the next summer white house and townsfolk although changrined 
about the potential for traffic jams and disruptions are eagerly 
awaiting the presidentelects arrival some speculate he may visit 
as soon as thanksgiving 
often such retreats have been presidents private homes john f 
kennedy used his familys compound in hyannisport mass lyndon b 
johnson his sprawling ranch in johnson city texas and jimmy carter 
his home in plains ga 
but benjamin harrison found his calm in a 100room hotel in cape 
may nj 
most recently president and mrs reagan have turned on many 
weekends to camp david the official presidential retreat 70 miles 
from washington in the catoctin mountains of maryland there the 
reagans have watched old movies and held singalongs of hollywood 
show tunes longer vacations have been held at the reagans mountain 
ranch in santa barbara calif where he was known to relax riding 
horseback even clearing brush 
richard nixon found solace and sunshine in san clemente calif 
and key biscayne fla but gerald ford preferred a ski resort in 
vail colo during his term in office 
the practice of going home for vacations began with the nations 
first president 
george washington traveled to his mount vernon estate from 
philadelphia where the capital was then located twice a year 
during his eight years in office according to ann rauscher a 
spokeswoman for the mount vernon ladies association which maintains 
the suburban washington dc home as a museum 
thomas jefferson traveled to monticello in charlottesville va 
whenever he could during his fouryear term receiving visitors and 
writing a mountain of letters 55000 of which have survived 
jefferson was a workaholic wherever he was so it was a change 
of pace but it was not the kind of r amp r we would associate with 
many presidential vacations in the modern time daniel p jordan 
director of monticello said of jeffersons trips home 
other presidents have been known to work much less while on 
vacation 
in l927 calvin coolidge spent from june to september at the 
state game lodge in south dakotas custer state park there 
according to lodge manager david shetler coolidge did nothing to 
dispell his reputation as the most skilled president at doing 
nothing 
at the end of his stay coolidge announced to reporters that he 
had decided against running for reelection in l928 
many presidents brought paperwork with them when leaving town or 
met with world leaders at their hideways 
in 1929 herbert hoover discussed the naval limitation 
disarmament treaty with british prime minister ramsay macdonald at 
his summer white house at camp rapidan a 164acre camp in the blue 
ridge mountains of virginia the treaty was later signed and adopted 
as a step toward world peace 
hoover donated the camp to the shenandoah national park to be 
used as a weekend and summer retreat for future presidents 
but it was a mountain camp 70 miles from washington that became 
the official weekend home for presidents in 1942 
that year franklin d roosevelt had camp david built in a heavily 
wooded area of catoctin mountain in maryland where the elevation 
kept the camp cool and its isolated high location provided adequate 
security he called it shangrila from the perfect mountain kingdom 
in lost horizon 
a number of historic meetings have been held there including 
roosevelts 1943 visit with great britains prime minister winston 
churchill and dwight eisenhowers conference with soviet premier 
nikita s khrushchev in 1959 
and in 1978 president carter hosted peace talks between 
president anwar elsadat of egypt and prime minister menachem begin 
of israel that resulted in a major agreement the camp david accords

george bush will be looking to deliver on his 
kinder and gentler nation theme when he moves into the white 
house but economic pressures could force him to put some campaign 
promises on the back burner 
the stock market retreat and the dollars fall in value since the 
nov 8 election both testify to the concerns the financial world has 
about the presidentelects ability to bring down the 155 billion 
annual deficit especially given his promise not to raise taxes 
bush has already decided to keep friend and adviser nicholas f 
brady on as secretary of the treasury and he told reporters at 
weeks end that he was concentrating next on filling out the rest of 
his economic team 
by all accounts the director of the office of management and 
budget is almost certain to be richard darman the former assistant 
treasury secretary and righthand aide to james a baker iii who has 
wide knowledge of the inner workings of the executive branch 
although bush was often accused of running an issueless race for 
the presidency he actually made enough speeches and produced enough 
position papers to fill a 347page book published by the republican 
national committee in the closing weeks of the campaign 
while some critics said bushs flexible freeze plan to 
balance the budget within four years was weak on specifics and built 
around rosy economic assumptions bush did flesh out a raft of other 
promises from a toddler tax credit costing nearly 2 billion to 
doubling the federal budget for prison construction 
bush will get an early chance to elaborate on those promises soon 
after he takes office on jan 20 when he will be called upon to 
revise the reagan administrations fiscal 1990 budget 
given these nervous nellies in the world financial markets im 
sure the new president will want to turn his attention to some of 
these economic issues said gary bauer the former reagan white 
house domestic policy adviser and now president of the family 
research council 
but bauer predicted that bush will quickly make his mark felt on 
such issues as abortion parental leave and day care both through 
judicial appointments and by framing better alternatives to 
liberal legislative approaches to social problems 
bush opposed a democratic bill in the 100th congress that would 
have forced employers to provide unpaid leaves to parents of 
newborns and sick children he also offered his 1000 toddler tax 
credit plan as an alternative to a 25 billion democratic plan to 
expand federal regulation and support for day care centers 
bush in two of his first speeches last week told literacy 
advocates and the national geographic society that he intends to 
deliver on his promises of being an education president and a 
strong environmentalist 
congress has already acted to help him keep some of those 
promises by enacting a ban on ocean dumping by 1991 and by allowing 
parents to earn taxfree interest on us savings bonds for college 
starting in 1990 
he is certain to have a tough time convincing democrats in 
congress of the merits of his plan to cut the capital gains tax rate 
to 15 percent from 28 percent or 33 percent bush has said his as 
yet unnamed defense secretary will have some tough decisions to 
make including choosing between the mobile mx and the midgetman 
missiles 
bush also is committed to sitting down with the nations 
governors to to discuss the continuing troubles of americas schools 
he has promised to spend more on the 18 billion head start 
program for disadvantaged preschool children and to create a new 
500 million program to reward schools that get good results with 
poor children 
he is pledged to spend at least several hundred million dollars 
to expand medicaid coverage for poor mothers and children 
bush has promised to convene a global conference on the 
environment within his first year 
without making any specific dollar commitments he has said the 
time for study of the acid rain problem is past he has promised to 
send congress legislation to cut millions of tons of sulfur 
dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and to significantly reduce 
nitrogen oxide emissions as well

rejecting both the bush and dukakis plans as 
unworkable the general accounting office said saturday that tax 
increases and cuts in defense and social security must be considered 
to slash a federal budget deficit that threatens the nations 
economic future 
additional revenues are probably an unavoidable part of any 
realistic strategy for reducing the deficit the congressional 
watchdog agency said in reports to presidentelect george bush and 
leaders of the house and senate 
comptroller general charles a bowsher director of the gao said 
a workable solution can be developed only through close cooperation 
between congress and the new president with bush personally 
involved in the negotiations 
the gao which uses hundreds of experts in every field to oversee 
the federal bureaucracy on behalf of congress made no 
recommendations on which taxes should be raised or which programs 
should be cut 
however the report cited estimates that 30 billion could be 
raised annually with slight increases in personal income tax rates 
and that a 5 percent national sales tax on most commodities except 
food housing and medical care would yield 67 billion a year 
all participants must consider all parts of the budget to be 
negotiable including defense entitlements such as social security 
and medicare and revenues the agency said 
the budget problem must be solved for the new administration to 
have any flexibility to pursue its own policy agenda for the 
economy to regain its vigor and for the american people to enjoy a 
longterm standard of living comparable to the rest of the developed 
world bowsher wrote 
but the gao said it saw no quick or painless solutions to the 
deficit which stood at 150 billion in the budget year that ended 
sept 30 it specifically rejected four approaches that have been 
proposed 
we cannot grow our way out of the problem an approach 
favored by some in the reagan administration and reiterated this 
week in a report by the conservative heritage foundation public 
demand for government services to solve problems ranging from drug 
abuse aids education and homelessness to drought and forest fires 
grow as fast as revenues said the gao 
we cannot freeze our way out of the problem during his 
presidential campaign bush repeatedly rejected higher taxes and 
advocated a flexible freeze on spending the gao noted that the 
great bulk of the budget is in politically sensitive areas such as 
social security farm price supports and defense or in fixed 
interest costs 
we cannot reach out and effortlessly gather in some magic pool 
of uncollected revenues democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis proposed raising revenues by collecting the 86 billion or 
more in unpaid tax liabilities annually the gao said administrative 
costs would be high and it would require several years to train new 
internal revenue service agents for the job 
we cannot sequester our way out of the problem through 
mechanistic formulabased program cuts of the sort prescribed in 
the grammrudmanhollings legislation that law is aimed at 
balancing the budget but the gao noted that as much as 80 percent 
of the budget is exempt from the laws mandated cuts 
although the deficit has dropped from the record levels reached 
earlier in the reagan administration the problem is actually worse 
not better than it appears the gao said 
for example it said the real deficit in the governments 
general fund is not 155 billion but 252 billion a 97 billion 
surplus in social security funds makes the general deficit look 
smaller 
even worse gao stated there is an explosion of unfunded costs 
waiting to greet the new adminstration 
among the biggest is the crisis in the nations savings and loan 
industry which the gao estimates will cost 50 billion to fix much 
of it financed by tax funds 
it also listed a cleanup and modernization of nuclear weapons 
plants costing 130 billion and said the defense departments 
fiveyear plan calls for at least 200 billion more than is likely 
to be available 
the gao also said president reagans strategic defense initiative 
will cost at least 69 billion in its first phase another 80 
billionplus will be needed for longrun modernization of computer 
and communications systems 25 billion for the air traffic control 
system and 28 billion for construction of a space station 
meanwhile the heritage foundation issued its own recommendations 
for wiping out the deficit it recommended holding the rate of 
spending growth to less than 4 percent a year and said the deficit 
would be eliminated in 1993 the private group said a tax increase 
would threaten economic growth which has produced the revenue that 
already has reduced the deficit

with george bushs victory still ringing 
in their ears democratic politicians already are taking their first 
delicate steps in iowa which state party leaders hope will remain 
the leadoff event for the 1992 presidential race 
so it came as no suprise to david ostendorf when the phone in his 
cramped upstairs office at the rural advocacy headquarters of 
prairiefire rang with the news that of course jesse jackson would 
be delighted to offer a fresh perspective on the election just 
past 
meanwhile state employee and party activist paulee lipsman 
lunched with delaware sen joe biden and got a handwritten note a 
few days later he wasnt closing any doors she said 
democrats face months of arguing over how they lost the 1988 
election and iowa activists are resigned to being assigned at least 
some of the blame because thats where the whole thing started last 
feb 8 
my sense is most iowa democrats expect there will be a debate 
about the iowa caucuses said bonnie campbell state democratic 
chairwoman they are defensive because they like what we do 
top democratic leaders are beginning to debate the role of the 
iowa caucuses in the next presidential election and any resolution 
is months away but in the past month a roster of failed democratic 
candidates has paraded through the state in the past month and 
candidates after all are what an election is all about 
the problem with changing the process is its something we talk 
about every four years its like leap year said phil roeder a 
former democratic party spokesman who now is political director for 
sen tom harkin 
the problem is the upcoming fouryear cycle of a campaign 
starts at the exact moment when the previous one ends that leaves 
virtually no time for serious reflection he said 
in gambling the term is hedging a bet in politics its called 
going to iowa just in case 
jackson stumped the state and agreed to speak this weekend at a 
convention of farm activists just the sort of liberal farmers who 
backed him this year 
that was clearly where he started ostendorf said he sees 
farm and rural people in general as being critical to future 
election work his own or anybody elses 
i think clearly hes coming here to make sure his base here and 
his roots here are kept solid he said 
with bushs inauguration still weeks away campaigning to replace 
him is a topic no one wants to discuss its a delicate mating dance 
where less is spoken than simply understood 
candidates are merely responding to invitations to share their 
views and renew acquaintances while perhaps making a few new ones 
you come in and touch base with those people said ted 
anderson a lobbyist for the union representing state workers 
evidently hes interested so why not 
its also shaping up as a strictly democratic show with 
republicans content to sit on the sidelines 
democratic leaders are making the case that iowa wasnt 
responsible for michael dukakis loss and point out that the state 
voted for a democratic presidential candidate in 1988 the first 
time in 24 years 
but the iowa caucuses failed to pick the eventual winner of the 
democratic and republican presidential nominations in 1988 both 
dukakis and bush came in third there 
critics of the iowa caucuses have said that the state is too 
small and its population too unrepresentative for the results to 
merit the time and and national attention they receive 
ms campbell said it will take more than iowabashing to end the 
states role 
everybody just assumes there are states out there just dying to 
be first and that may not be the case she said nobody has 
really offered a concrete alternative it may well be that nothing 
happens i think if we survive that will be why 
others take a more pragmatic view arguing that the state is 
almost certain to be forced to share some of its luster by the 
clamor for change 
i dont see iowa going quietly off into the sunset roeder 
said i think were still going to be first but i think theres a 
chance some other important states will move up 
but as activists argue and party officials debate about a time 
window for early primaries the candidates will settle the 
question 
we can hold our caucuses irrespective of the window but it 
will be a question of whether the candidates come here ms 
campbell said and we dont know that 
weve seen some people who obviously have some thoughts about 
1992 roeder said i think theyre all when it comes right down 
to it smart politicians and they would say theyre not going to 
close any doors to any opportunities

the united states outpaced other major nations 
in improving the energy efficiency of its industries from 1970 to 
1986 but still lags behind most other industrial countries an 
environmental research group said saturday 
the world resources institute said the united states gained 33 
percent in energy used per dollar of gross national product the 
total retail value of all goods and services produced by the 
economy in those 16 years 
japan ranked second with a 32 percent gain gains of some other 
countries included canada and france 28 percent west germany 23 
percent britain 19 percent italy 15 percent and brazil 6 
percent 
the international energy agency recently ranked the united states 
in eighth place among 20 countries in gains in efficiency of energy 
use by industry from 1973 to 1985 
pushed by the two oil shocks of the 1970s and rapidly rising 
prices that continued through the early 1980s most developed 
nations managed to use less energy to turn out goods and services by 
the mid1980s 
according to figures compiled by the us energy information 
administration us energy efficiency improved at about 11 percent 
per year in the 1970s accelerated to 28 percent per year from 1980 
to 1986 and remained essentially unchanged in 198687 
an 06 percent gain is expected this year 
here is the energy use per dollar of gross national product 
expressed in terms btus per dollars of 1980 buying power for each 
country a btu or british thermal unit is a standard energy unit 
about 300 btus are used in boiling a quart of water

makeshift camp in the mirpur area police said 
they said about 1000 huts were destroyed before firemen brought

the shantytown houses about 20000 people the residents speak 
urdu rather than bangladeshs dominant bengali language and call 
themselves stranded pakistanis

violence by rightwing death squads drug 
traffickers and leftist guerrillas is practically out of control in 
colombia undermining confidence in president virgilio barcos 
government 
while colombians largely blame barco for the worst violence since 
a war between the liberal and conservative parties left at least 
200000 dead in the early 1950s it clearly results from the 
cautious approach to social reform by the white minority of about 25 
percent that rules this country of 30 million 
leftist guerrillas pose the most serious threat and demonstrate 
most clearly the growing discontent in the lower classes fifteen 
years ago the guerrillas scarcely had 1000 poorly equipped 
combatants today they number an estimated 10000 
the rebels are believed to have thousands of peasant sympathizers 
who aid them they also have mortars antitank rockets 
shoulderfired groundtoair missiles machine guns and other 
lightweight modern weapons 
police reported 489 kidnappings in the last year 51 percent of 
them by leftist guerrillas guerrillas this year have attacked 49 
towns blown up oil and gas pipelines 56 times ambushed two dozen 
army patrols and destroyed bridges electricity towers and other 
public works 
in addition 
rightwing death squads have killed 249 people in 20 massacres 
this year 
drug traffickers have killed 26 judges a justice minister an 
attorney general two newspaper editors and scores of other people 
in the last four years 
about 150 members of the countrys two rival cocaine families 
have been killed this year in a war over control of cocaine 
distribution in new york city 
the rapid growth of the guerrilla movement indicates the lower 
class especially peasants in rural areas feel there is no 
alternative for bettering their lives 
still no one influential in colombian politics seems to go along 
with arguments that much of the violence results from colombias 
white minority refusing to change the political and economic 
structure that keeps indians and blacks at the bottom 
the minimum wage has stood at the equivalent of about 90 a 
month for the past two decades it is not enough for many to afford 
education medical care and basic foods such as eggs milk bread 
and meat it is not uncommon for some families to have one meal a 
day of soup made with something like turnip greens 
there is no room in public schools for tens of thousands of 
children and many poor families do not have the money for books 
materials and uniforms to send their children to school even if 
there is room the wealthy and the middle classes send their 
children to private schools 
in the last land ownership survey in 1970 the government found 
that 43 percent of the people owned 68 percent of the land and that 
10 percent of the farmers held 80 percent of the land 
the government of former president belisario betancur government 
allowed leftist guerrillas to organize a party the patriotic union 
in 1984 but rightwing death squads have killed more than 600 
members of the party including its president 
neither barco nor betancur who first proposed peace talks with 
guerrillas in 1982 made a serious attempt to wipe out the death 
squads 
on nov 11 a death squad in three vehicles rode through the town 
of segovia in northern colombia for almost an hour firing 
submachine guns and throwing hand grenades fortythree people were 
killed and more than 30 were wounded 
two months ago barco offered to pardon all guerrillas who 
surrendered and proposed peace talks however the plan lacked any 
new approach to colombias problems and the government said it would 
not negotiate changes in the countrys political economic and 
social structure 
the countrys six guerrilla groups rejected the offer calling it 
an ultimatum to surrender and launched an unprecedented wave of 
attacks 
barcos government has not abandoned hopes for peace talks and 
has restrained the army from taking the offensive against the 
guerrillas 
the army has been held back since betancur first offered peace 
talks a ceasefire negotiated by the betancur government collapsed 
and betancur fired a defense minister who refused to accept the 
peace initiative 
the armys disagreement with a negotiated settlement surfaced 
again this month when the countrys top general defense minister 
rafael samudio called for allout war on the guerrillas 
barco fired him within 24 hours 
a former liberal party president alfonso lopez michelsen said 
last month the 170000man military must be increased by 50 percent 
to meet the guerrilla threat 
the countrys most influential newspaper el tiempo a bogota 
daily that traditionally supports the liberal party has criticized 
barcos peace initiatives and called for doubling the size of the 
army 
with the governments refusal to negotiate substantial social 
changes and with the army gaining support for a military solution 
it appears inevitable colombia is headed for even more violence

a human jawbone unearthed in central china has 
been found to date back 2 million years making it the oldest human 
fossil discovered in china an archaeologist said saturday 
the jawbone with several teeth was discovered in 1986 near the 
upper reaches of the yangtze river in sichuan province but dating 
tests were completed only recently 
the official peoples daily published the conclusion saturday in 
a frontpage report and said it reinforced still inconclusive 
arguments that man originated in asia not africa 
ji hongxiang an archaelogist at the academy of social sciences 
and member of the team that excavated the site said in a telephone 
interview that experts believed the man to whom the jawbone belonged 
was able to use fire and simple tools 
the bone was found buried along with numerous bones of monkeys 
and other mammals ji said 
the oldest human remains previously found in china were teeth 
found in yuanmu county in southern chinas yunnan province in 1965 
they were determined to be 17 million years old 
archaeologists found more teeth last year in yuanmu on butterfly 
ridge and announced they were 25 million to 4 million years old and 
were human however other chinese experts said the teeth came from 
an ape 
chinas most famous human fossils are the peking man bones 
discovered near beijing in 1929 and lost during world war ii in the 
1930s the bones were dated as 500000 years old but some experts 
believe the more advanced tests used now might prove them 
considerably older 
fossil finds in eastern africa indicate that the earliest kind of 
primitive humans lived there about 25 million years ago

there are more than 10 
million refugees who have been forced to flee their homes because of 
environmental disasters or degraded lands and their number may soon 
exceed those displaced by war or rebellion an environmental 
research group said saturday 
because migration is a last resort when conditions become so 
poor that life itself is in imminent danger the rising number of 
environmental refugees should be seen as an important indicator of 
the extent and severity of worldwide environmental deterioration 
said the worldwatch institute in a report 
worldwatchs figures count people displaced as a result of 
longterm environmental changes such as the encroachment of deserts 
on pastureland in africa as well as sudden disasters such as the 
recent flooding in bangladesh 
it estimated that there are about 10 million refugees as a result 
of such environmental changes compared to about 13 million who have 
been displaced by wars or rebellions 
land degradation takes many forms and may involve erosion 
waterlogging or excessive salt buildup from poor irrigation 
according to some estimates as many as 20 million acres of 
agricultural land is destroyed each year by either a shortage of 
water causing desertification or too much water causing land to 
become waterlogged 
meanwhile another report suggested that while the effort will be 
expensive much of this land in developing countries could be 
restored with the proper techniques and incentives 
rehabilitating and restoring degraded lands is at least as much 
a social economic and political problem as an ecological one 
said the report by the world resources institute it cited as 
examples land rehabilitation programs in egypt india and china 
the report gave no cost estimate for such rehabilitation but 
noted that 10 forestry and watershed rehabilitation projects 
recommended by the united nations food and agriculture organization 
would cost 1 billion

when the campaign for mondays election started 
seven weeks ago no one predicted it would become a debate over 
canadas future its national identity and perhaps its very soul 
but the question of whether to proceed with the free trade 
agreement that would eliminate trade barriers between the united 
states and canada quickly overshadowed other issues and electrified 
the race 
instead of the prevailing view that canadian identity was 
insecure and fragile each side found it had a lot to be proud of in 
canada despite vastly different interpretations 
the election will decide much more than the 295 seats in the 
house of commons 
it also will determine if the trade agreement goes into effect 
jan 1 as scheduled and it may set a new vision of canada as a 
mature nation 
only a majority government for prime minister brian mulroneys 
progressive conservative party assures enforcement of the pact 
mulroney signed with president reagan on jan 2 the agreement has 
been approved by the us congress and still needs canadian 
parliamentary approval to take effect 
mulroney says the agreement is crucial to future canadian 
prosperity by assuring access to the larger us market 
john turners liberal party and the socialist new democratic 
party headed by ed broadbent oppose the deal they say free trade 
would reduce canada to a junior partner of the united states its 
sovereignty restricted and its basic identity threatened 
polls indicate a close race between the conservatives and the 
liberals with the new democrats trailing in third place but a 
victory for either opposition party or a minority government would 
effectively block the agreement 
mulroney led the conservatives to a landslide victory in 1984 in 
the house of commons he appeared headed for another easy mandate 
when he called the election oct 1 and dissolved parliament 
the liberals long a dominant force in canadian politics were 
still recovering from their 1984 defeat and divided by internal 
tensions over turners leadership 
broadbent was hoping his personal popularity could spark the new 
democrats to their best showing ever 
although opinion was divided on the free trade agreement polls 
initially showed strong support for the conservatives whose four 
years in office were marked by general prosperity 
but all that changed in a nationally televised debate between 
turner and mulroney on oct 25 
the silverhaired liberal forcefully told mulroney that the prime 
minister had sold us out with an agreement that would turn 
canada into a pale replica of the united states 
youve been scaremongering mulroney responded saying there 
was not the slightest justification for such fears 
but the debate made the trade issue the focus of the rest of the 
campaign 
canada and the united states are each others biggest trading 
partners with about 150 billion worth of goods crossing the border 
the strongest trade partnership in the world 
the agreement would phase out all tariffs between the two nations 
over a 10year period creating a unified north american market 
aimed at 245 million americans and 26 million canadians 
mulroney and other supporters of the agreement argue that it 
wont affect canadian traditions or sovereignty they say that 
without assured access to the us market canada risks becoming an 
isolated backwater of international trade 
the prime minister calls the trade deal a visionary instrument 
of job creation and new wealth and it is clearly something that is 
on the right side of history 
he says canada is a mature and competent nation able to compete 
with the united states without resorting to the high tariffs of 
19thcentury protectionism 
but turner and his supporters say the pact will turn the nation 
into a pool of natural resources for the united states and threaten 
its social and healthcare programs which are heavily sponsored by 
the government 
the liberal candidate says the pact threatens the sense of 
community and fairness that characterizes canada unleashing free 
market forces and unchecked competition 
referring to the privatized american system of health care the 
liberal candidate told his supporters that when you walk into a 
canadian hospital they dont check your credit card before they 
check your pulse 
in the past weeks a cottage industry of publications has sprung 
up for and against almost every aspect of the agreement in 
addition lobby groups have promoted extensive campaigns to support 
or oppose the deal 
lastminute commercials from the conservatives portray turner as 
an opportunist who jumped on the free trade issue to save his own 
political future without regard to the country 
commercials sponsored by the liberals show mulroney saluting the 
united states 
turner maintains that he is not antiamerican or against free 
trade but that the agreement is simply a bad deal

the progressive conservative party is back in the 
lead and could win the parliamentary majority needed for the free 
trade agreement with the united states to proceed according to a 
gallup poll published saturday 
the poll showed prime minister brian mulroneys conservatives 
with 40 percent the liberal party led by john turner with 35 
percent and the socialist new democratic party led by ed broadbent 
with 22 percent 
it said such an outcome in mondays election could translate into 
162 seats for the conservatives in the newly expanded 295seat 
house of commons 14 more than needed for a majority 
the poll published by the toronto star said the liberals would 
have 97 seats and the new democrats 36 
both opposition parties oppose the agreement signed by mulroney 
and president reagan in january it still needs canadian 
parliamentary approval to take effect jan 1 as scheduled it would 
phase out all tariffs between canada and the united states over a 
10year period 
the gallup poll was based on 2097 personal interviews and 1970 
telephone interviews between monday and thursday it had a margin of 
error of 3 percent 
another poll published saturday by angus reid of winnipeg 
manitoba found similar results it placed the conservatives ahead 
with 41 percent of decided voters 33 percent for the liberals and 
23 percent for the new democrats 
reid one of the most widely published pollsters in canada said 
it was inconclusive whether the popular vote would result in a 
conservative majority or minority government 
a gallup poll published monday found the conservatives and 
liberals tied with 35 percent each and the new democrats in third 
with 26 percent 
the last poll by the environics research group firm published in 
the globe and mail newspaper on nov 10 found 37 percent for the 
liberals 35 percent for the conservatives and 24 percent for the 
new democrats

former tennessee sen howard baker jr 
who left retirement to be president reagans chief of staff during 
the irancontra scandal was named saturday to receive the 1989 
harry s truman good neighbor award 
it has been presented annually since 1973 by the harry s truman 
good neighbor award foundation to a person who exemplifies the 
accomplishments and characteristics of the late democratic president

president reagan signed legislation overriding 
a supreme court decision that allowed the veterans administration to 
deny benefits to veterans who were alcoholics because their conduct 
was labeled willful misconduct the white house said saturday 
under the bill signed by reagan on friday the disabling effects 
of chronic alcoholism will not be considered to the result of 
willful misconduct the white house said 
previously veterans could obtain an extension of the 10year 
period for using their gi bill educational benefits if they had been 
prevented from using the benefits earlier by a physical or mental 
disorder which did not stem from willful misconduct 
the legislation results from a lawsuit filed by two veterans who 
were recovering alcoholics who had sought an extension of the 
benefit period the va rejected their request on the basis that 
their condition was determined to be willful misconduct 
in april supreme court said in a 43 decision that the 
government could disqualify the veteranss request for a benefits 
extension in denying the two mens request it said the va did not 
violate a federal law protecting the rights of the handicapped 
the high court did not address the issue of whether alcoholism is 
a disease but said the va was not compelled to regard it as such 
it also said those who believe there is a conflict should ask 
congress to change the law 
groups treating alcoholics have long dealt with it as a disease 
but critics fear that this approach removes individual 
responsibility for such behavior as drunken driving and spouse and 
child abuse 
reagan signed separate legislation friday providing a 41 percent 
costofliving increase in the compensation paid to nearly 22 
million veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and to about 
323000 surviving spouses and dependents of veterans who died of 
servicerelated causes 
the same measure establishes a new sevenmember us court of 
veterans appeals based in washington to review disputes over va 
benefits

a parliamentary committee on saturday found 
estonias bid for sovereignty at odds with the soviet constitution 
but activists in a nearby republic demanded their leaders approve 
similar autonomy 
in new delhi where he was on an official visit soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev said some estonians were acting too emotionally 
but that the tense formerly independent baltic republics would 
settle down 
what is happening in estonia is perestroika gorbachev said 
a commission of the national supreme soviet ruled that an 
amendment to the estonian constitution ran counter to the supreme 
national law according to the official tass news agency 
the amendment passed wednesday requires any new soviet law be 
ratified by estonia 
laws approved by the estonian parliament contained a number of 
provisions which run counter to the norms of the constitution of the 
ussr on which the soviet socialist federation is based tass 
said 
the commissions conclusion was submitted to the presidium of the 
supreme soviet the countrys highest executive body which summoned 
estonian leaders to a meeting in moscow 
the supreme soviet of another baltic republic lithuania was set 
to debate similar legislation last week but it was dropped without 
a vote when the republics communist party leader algirdas 
brazauskas said it was unconstitutional 
the streets of the lithuanian capital vilnius were quiet but 
there is huge dissatisfaction with the work of the session said 
alvydas medalinskas a spokesman for the grassroots lithuanian 
movement for perestroika 
scattered demonstrations were reported in vilnius on friday night 
after the republics supreme soviet adjourned 
medalinskas said in a telephone interview that the movement was 
seeking the signatures of the 350 members of the lithuanian supreme 
soviet on a letter declaring the session invalid because of gross 
violations of parliamentary rules 
seventeen already have signed it five rejected it all 
together said medalinskas in a telephone interview 
if onethird or 117 legislators sign the letter a new session 
must be held he said 
spokesmen for the lithuanian movement for perestroika said 
brazauskas appeared on the republics official television saturday 
night defending results of the session and saying the legislators 
could not go any further 
in the 15minute speech he also said efforts to pressure 
legislators into calling for a new session were impermissible said 
representatives of the movement 
in an apparent kremlin effort to reassure the countrys 15 
constituent republics the council of ministers met with their 
representatives friday on economic powersharing official radio 
moscow said 
the small westwardlooking baltic republics have used 
gorbachevs political reforms to push for greater economic and 
cultural autonomy baltic residents also contend that proposed 
amendments to the soviet constitution will limit their autonomy 
in his comments in india gorbachev said there is a lot of 
debate on how to approach the problem i am sure things will settle 
down 
soviets are considering many differing points of view but not 
all are constructive the soviet leader said 
some are purely emotional and this has been causing some 
negative reactions he said 
he offered no proposals for dealing with the problem 
gorbachev said people in the baltic republics were legitimately 
concerned about many things including the migration of ethnic 
russians 
the three baltic republics estonian lithuania and latvia 
were independent after the 1917 bolshevik revolution until 1940 
when they were absorbed by the soviet union under a secret agreement 
between stalin and hitler

presidentelect george bush moving to make 
good on a campaign pledge to stress ethics in government got off to 
a fast start last week by asking his transition staff to promise 
they would avoid conflicts of interest 
specialists in government ethis praised the actions bush has 
taken in the two weeks since his election but they said the real 
test of his administrations commitment to clean government will 
come later 
when someone trips up bush has to live up to his promise and 
take action against that person difficult as it may be said 
stephen gillers a law professor at new york university and an 
ethics specialist 
bernard wruble the first man to head the office of government 
ethics which was established under the 1978 ethics in government 
act agreed the moment he has one bad apple he has to act in a 
very positive manner wruble said 
an administrations ethical climate comes from the president 
he said 
bush ordered his transition staff to sign a standards of 
conduct declaration that requires them to disqualify themselves 
from matters in which they might have a financial conflict 
robert m teeter codirector of bushs transition office said 
the pledges were meant to emphasize to the public once again that 
they can have full confidence in the people who he hires to do the 
publics business for him 
throughout his public life bush has stressed ethics and 
standards of conduct teeter said 
the white house announced saturday that president reagan had 
signed a memorandum ordering all federal officials who are working 
with the transition team to sign the same ethics pledge required of 
bushs aides the pledge includes a codeofsilence agreement that 
officials will hold in confidence any information about 
transition matters 
during the presidential campaign democrats repeatedly raised the 
socalled sleaze factor and said 11 top reagan administration 
officials had resigned under fire or were investigated indicted or 
convicted 
the officials included two of reagans close personal friends 
former attorney general edwin meese iii and former deputy white 
house chief of staff michael k deaver 
in an apparent attempt to put distance between himself and the 
reagan administration on this issue bush said he would appoint a 
senior counselor for ethics establish ethics offices in every 
government agency and have mandatory annual briefings for ethics 
officers each agency already has a designated ethics officer 
common cause the citizens lobby said bushs transition pledge 
looks fine but there are other tests waiting said ann mcbride 
the groups vice president 
specifically common cause wants bush to pressure reagan to sign 
the socalled revolving door bill which would clamp down on 
lobbying by former members of congress and former senior 
administration officials 
congress passed the bill and bush endorsed it but reagan has yet 
to sign it into law the measure establishes a oneyear waiting 
period before former highranking officials can lobby congress or 
the executive branch 
the bush administration also should close loopholes in the 
campaign finance laws she said 
in one of his first acts after his nov 8 election bush 
appointed c boyden gray as his transition counsel gray who will 
become the white house legal adviser is setting up procedures for 
advising prospective federal appointees on financial disclosure 
requirements 
were going to be a little more aggressive about anticipating 
problems gray said 
gray already has met with officials from the office of government 
ethics which oversees compliance with financial disclosure 
requirements 
bushs people are very sincere in their efforts to ensure 
that appointees adhere strictly to the letter of the law said 
donald campbell deputy director of the ethics office 
a major task involves financial disclosure forms transition 
officials will examine the forms to spot potential trouble areas 
such as corporate severance pay campbell said for instance 
severance cannot be paid to a new government employee to supplement 
his income 
all government officials appointed by the president or holding a 
civil service rank of grade 16 or above must complete the forms 
listing income assets and liabilities pay for a grade 16 starts at 
about 67000 
forms for about 1000 presidential appointees are reviewed by the 
designated ethics official at each government agency as well as by 
the ethics office failure to follow the legal requirements can lead 
to criminal prosecution 
in the campaign bush also endorsed the special prosecutor law 
that the reagan administration opposed he said the law also should 
apply to members of congress on the last day before he resigned in 
august meese signed an order that expanded the law to cover 
congress 
meese was investigated twice by independent counsels on 
allegations of financial conflict of interest but no charges were 
ever filed against him 
last july independent counsel james mckay concluded that meese 
probably broke two tax laws 
deaver was convicted of lying to a grand jury and a house 
subcommittee which investigated his lobbying activities after he 
left the white house staff deaver was fined 100000 ordered to 
perform 1500 hours of community service and placed on probation for 
three years

complaint by a 37yearold west hartford man the man and his wife 
had sought assistance from the women whom he knew as helene 
and helena for help in overcoming his impotence so he and his 
wife could have children

the california supreme court has entered 
uncharted legal water as it attempts to determine the 
constitutionality of proposition 103 the voterapproved measure 
slashing insurance rates 
the justices are pondering a case that has no direct legal 
precedent in a state where insurance rates have never been 
regulated and the court hasnt decided whether it will hear the 
case or refer it to a lower court 
but with many insurers restricting or eliminating california 
coverage in response to proposition 103 and with the legislature 
and republican gov george deukmejians administration seemingly 
looking for direction all sides want a quick resolution 
the court responded to insurers lawsuits on nov 10 by blocking 
enforcement of a 20 percent rate reduction and other provisions of 
the initiative approved by voters two days earlier 
while the court has often been sympathetic to business concerns 
it also advocates judicial restraint which generally includes 
deferring to voters 
insurers are challenging many provisions of the measure an 
initiative sponsored by consumer advocate ralph nader that was the 
only one of five insurancerelated measures to win voter approval 
nov 8 
the central features of the case are these 
proposition 103 requires that rates for motor vehicle homeowner 
and other property and casualty insurance be rolled back to november 
1987 levels and then reduced 20 percent and frozen until november 
1989 insurers could win exemptions only by showing a substantial 
threat of insolvency the companies contend the cut and freeze 
amount to confiscation of property 
starting in november 1989 the measure requires the state 
insurance commissioner to approve all rate increases for those same 
types of insurance prohibiting any rates that are excessive 
inadequate or unfairly discriminatory although that language has 
been upheld in other states insurers contend it is virtually 
meaningless in california because the expected volume of rate 
requests will make the process unworkable 
a company will be allowed to refuse to renew an auto insurance 
policy only for nonpayment or fraud by the policyholder or a 
substantial increase in the insured risk insurers contend the 
provision would effectively prohibit them from withdrawing from the 
auto insurance business in california in violation of their 
property rights 
other provisions include an additional 20 percent cut in november 
1989 for good drivers as defined by the measure auto insurance 
rates based primarily on a drivers safety record annual mileage 
and experience conversion of the insurance commissioners job to an 
elected office in 1990 repeal of the industrys exemption from 
state antitrust laws and required disclosure of insurance company 
finances insurers contend those issues cannot be separated from the 
rate rollback and must also be thrown out 
the justices cannot consult any prior california cases on the 
rate rollback and freeze issue because the state has never regulated 
the prices of insurance or any similar commodity utility rates are 
controlled under a separate body of laws 
some roughly similar constitutional issues arose however in 
cases in 1976 and 1984 involving challenges by landlords to rent 
control measures in berkeley both sides in the insurance case rely 
heavily on these rulings 
the court concluded in the two cases the government could roll 
back rates to earlier levels but that property owners were entitled 
to rate increases giving them a fair return on investment under 
reasonably prompt administrative procedures 
the two sides in the proposition 103 case disagree over whether 
state review of insurance rates will be cumbersome or prompt more 
fundamentally they disagree over the constitutionality of requiring 
insurers to cut their rates 20 percent for a year unless they can 
show a substantial threat of insolvency 
insurers say those provisions violate the fair return on 
investment standard recognized in the rent control cases and force 
them to operate at a loss without relief and requiring a company to 
claim a threat of insolvency to seek an exemption would scare away 
investors and policyholders

capacity and that the work force is producing so efficiently 
that no one can touch them

enjoyed reagan said

is waiting to see if the incoming president has a plan for reducing

the reagan administration to submit a realistic budget to congress

muscovites lined up in a driving snow saturday to 
view an exhibit of the injustices of the stalin years when millions 
of their compatriots vanished into the hell of prisons and labor 
camps and never returned 
a christian cannot be a good christian without recognizing that 
hes a sinner said one of the exhibits organizers historian 
nikita g okhotin how can one be a soviet without recognizing the 
errors made in his nations past 
in the columned cultural hall of a moscow light bulb factory the 
week of conscience opened with a jarring reminder of abuses 
committed during the 19241953 rule of josef stalin whose legacy of 
terror has been repudiated by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the weeklong exhibit which will include films discussions and 
tributes to stalins victims was sponsored by the weekly magazine 
ogonyok which has been in the vanguard of gorbachevs campaign for 
glasnost or greater candor including frankness about the dark 
pages of soviet history 
the memorial will be the manifestation of the grief of the 
people for millions of their compatriots unjustifiably repressed 
and will mean their political rehabilitation ogonyok editor 
vitaly korotich told the tass news agency before the exhibit opened 
in the hall which belongs to the factory and was built for the 
employees 
the week of conscience is another blow to the reputation of 
stalin whose repressions and harsh central controls are now blamed 
by gorbachev and his followers for many of the nations political 
social and economic ills 
in a side room at the cultural hall a wooden board twice as high 
as a man bears pieces of paper with the names of thousands of 
russians jews armenians and others arrested in 1937 at the height 
of what historians call stalins great purge 
each sheet carries the laconic notice vmn the 
russianlanguage initials for highest measure of punishment the 
euphemism then used to designate the death penalty 
western historians estimate that 8 million to 10 million soviets 
died in the 193638 great purge when stalin was ridding the soviet 
communist party government and society of both real and imagined 
opponents 
many victims were posthumously rehabilitated by nikita s 
khrushchev following stalins death in 1953 and others have had 
charges against them wiped from the judicial record but the fate of 
countless others remains unknown 
reseachers like okhotin from the group memorial spoke to more 
than 100 soviets seeking news about family members or friends 
swallowed up by the vast network of prisons and labor camps that 
alexander solzhehnitsyn dubbed the gulag archipelago 
tatyana vasileyevna of moscow gave reseachers a portrait of her 
grandfather mikhail m gerasimov a moscow physicist who once was 
photographed as an honored worker alongside stalin and his henchman 
lavrenti beria but in 1937 was arrested and shot 
maybe his picture will help somebody else track down someone 
near and dear to them mrs vasileyevna said 
some exhibits inspired pity and sorrow vasily p petrovsky 
thendirector of the light bulb factory was arrested in 1938 and 
shot a collage of photographs and documents told the sad story of 
his family 
our family my sister and myself experienced all the circles 
of hell for belonging to a family of enemies of the people 
petrovskys daughter wrote but never did we have a desire to 
leave the motherland after the victory in world war ii we 
sang songs in praise of stalin the wise the dear and the 
beloved 
a wheelbarrow bearing a sign saying for the memorial to the 
victims of stalins repression was filled with five and 10ruble 
notes donated by visitors some wrote the names of family members 
killed in the purges on banknotes before tossing them in 
the ruling politburo authorized the building of a monument in 
moscow to stalins victims this year and dozens of designs were on 
diplay 
one shows a hammer and sickle the symbol of the soviet state 
but the hammer is smeared with blood and the sickle broken 
one woman proposed construction of a fountain of tears 
stalin has his defenders among those who long for the order he 
epitomized and arguments broke out when some visitors criticized 
the antistalinist theme 
how dare they criticize one man we were all guilty of 
wrongdoing exclaimed a russian man in his 50s 
thats rubbish shot back a bearded neighbor they want us 
to believe that it lets those who were really guilty escape

president reagan signed legislation saturday 
designed to counter the wave of insider trading scandals that rocked 
wall street several years ago and shook the confidence of the 
nations investors 
the measure doubles the maximum criminal penalties for insider 
trading from five years in jail to 10 years and boost fines from 
500000 to 25 million for a company and from 100000 to 1 
million for an individual 
it also holds firms liable to fines for the actions of their 
employees if the firms knowingly or recklessly fail to detect 
and prevent insider trading 
contrary to some of the publicity given to other bill signings in 
recent weeks the white house simply put out a brief announcement 
that reagan had signed the bill congress passed the legislation in 
the final days of congress in october 
greed and fear are competing emotions but until now there has 
not been a proper balance between the two i think now the fear of 
apprehension is going to be at least as great as the lure of 
greed rep edward j markey d mass chief sponsor of the bill 
and chairman of the house subcommittee that oversees the securities 
markets said after the measures final passage 
markey predicted the bill will change attitudes toward insider 
trading a crime that is both hard to detect and difficult to prove 
because he maintained white collar criminals fear the prospects of 
going to jail 
the legislation would also 
authorize the securities and exchange commission to offer 
tipsters a bounty of up to 10 percent of any fine collected 
codify the right of investors to sue inside traders if they lost 
money by trading in the same securities and at the same time as 
insiders 
permit the sec to issue subpoenas and investigate insider 
trading on behalf of foreign countries with the idea that foreign 
countries would offer reciprocal privileges to the united states 
the sec and the industry had been pushing for a legislative 
definition of insider trading which until now has been defined by 
regulators and the courts 
but to win the support of house energy and commerce chairman 
john dingell dmich the bill left insider trading undefined 
dingell believes a written definition would in effect become a 
road map to evasion providing defense attorneys with loopholes the 
industry complains it is unfair to give only vague guidance

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address delivered from the oval office 
my fellow americans over 350 years ago a small band of pilgrims 
after gathering in their first harvest at plymouth colony invited 
their friends and neighbors who were indians to join them in a feast 
of thanksgiving 
together they sat around their bountiful table and bowed their 
heads in gratitude to the lord for all he had bestowed upon them 
this week so many years later we too will gather with family 
and friends and after saying grace carve up a turkey pass around 
the cranberries and dressing and later share slices of pumpkin pie 
we americans have so much for which to be thankful think of the 
great expanse of our nation the rolling hills of our immense 
farmland even in years of drought as this year has been the plows 
and the sweat of americas farmers call forth from our good earth 
more food than we can possibly eat so much food that taken 
together our harvests of wheat corn soybeans fruits vegetables 
and all the other bounty of our land make up one of our most 
important exports 
not only we but the entire world can be thankful for that 
millions of children across all the continents are happier 
healthier and stronger because of americas farmers 
now think of our manufacturing centers after almost a decade of 
hard often painful work cultivating our industrial fields to meet a 
whole new generation of world competition this year we can see the 
first harvest of that work almost every american industry is 
zipping along at near full capacity 
a few years ago journalists were calling the midwest the rust 
belt now the boom belt would be more like it from lehigh valley in 
eastern pennsylvania to dayton and detroit and beyond the factory 
whistles again sound in the old factory towns and we hope theyll 
blow soon where they dont now 
by the way often those whistles are at the plants of entirely 
new companies providing new products and services to the nation and 
to the world 
in the past year america added 425000 new manufacturing jobs 
and when it comes to world competition no one can stop us now and 
thats not the only good news according to one of the foremost 
authorities in manufacturing peter drucker the old myth about low 
wages and low manufacturing costs may be dead for good 
in this age of high technology factories highly paid skilled 
workers americas kind of workers produce so efficiently that no 
one can touch them thats why its gratifying but not surprising 
to find out that americas manufacturing productivity has grown at 
oneandahalf times the postwar average during our expansion and 
thats why this year even as european and japanese manufacturing 
employment has stagnated our manufacturing employment has increased 
but prosperity is not an end in itself it helps us pay attentio 
to the more important things raising our children as we want them 
to be raised helping others in need and bringing nations together 
in peace 
this week world peace has been very much on my mind here in 
washington weve received visits from two of americas friends 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher and germanys 
chancellor helmut kohl in our meetings these two great leaders 
and i talked about the prosperity that all the nations of the 
industrial world enjoy and about the cuts in taxes and the return 
to the principles of the free market that have made it possible 
and we talked about the success over the past eight years of our 
policy of peace through strength 
yes peace is another thing for which we can say a prayer of 
gratitude over the dinner table on thursday peace and abundance in 
this land that god has kissed 
we will give thanks for these and one thing more our freedom 
yes in america freedom seems like the air around us its there 
its sweet though we rarely give it a thought yet as the air 
fills our lungs freedom fills our souls it gives breath to our 
laughter and joy it gives voice to our songs it gives us strength 
as we race for our dreams 
think of those around the world who cannot bow their heads in 
prayer without risking their lives think of those countries where 
to write an honest word or even to own a childs simple toy 
printing press is a crime think of how many countries where to 
dream of striking out on your own and starting a business is to take 
a chance not on a better life for yourself and your children but 
on a long stay in a prison cell 
and then think about how blessed we are to be americans yes as 
we gather together this thanksgiving to ask the lords blessings as 
we of whatever faith we are give praises to his name let us thank 
him for our peace prosperity and freedom 
happy thanksgiving and until next week thanks for listening 
and god bless you

when honeyvoiced dorothea montalvo 
puente strolled away from a detective nov 11 it was only her 
latest escape from the clutches of an often bumbling officialdom 
that missed evidence of wrongdoing 
puente fled to los angeles while police dug up seven bodies in 
the yard of her victorian boardinghouse five days later after a 
search in nevada california and mexico police arrested her and 
charged her with one count of murder 
prosecutors believe the victims were elderly tenants killed for 
their social security money and said they plan to file additional 
murder charges against puente who in a tv interview admitted 
cashing checks but denied killing anyone 
puente 59 was known to state federal local and even private 
social services officials long before police unearthed the bodies 
in fact she served 2 years in prison for drugging and robbing 
three elderly men she met in a bar and is still on parole in a 
separate 1980 case for forging a government check belonging to an 
elderly person 
a partial list of the authorities that had contact with puente 
reads like a whos who of government bureaucracies federal 
parole officials police welfare workers the social security 
administration county mental health officials health inspectors 
and social workers 
they all apparently missed evidence of wrongdoing at her 
boardinghouse 
for example 
federal parole officials assigned to puente because of her 1978 
conviction for forging a us treasury check belonging to an elderly 
person monitored her once a month but never discovered she had 
violated two key provisions of her parole handling treasury checks 
and associating with the elderly and disabled she remains on parole 
through 1990 charlie varnon justice department chief probation 
officer in sacramento told the san francisco examiner that agents 
never saw evidence indicating she had been running a boardinghouse 
but he acknowledged they never looked further than her upstairs 
apartment 
accusations that puente poisoned and robbed two elderly women 
led to an investigation that resulted in her conviction in 1982 on 
drug forgery and theft charges in the case involving the men she 
met in a bar she was sentenced to five years and was released in 
1985 despite her criminal record however county social workers 
had been referring elderly people to her boardinghouse the county 
health department said friday it is investigating whether social 
service and mental health workers should have been aware that 
puentes boarders were at risk 
neighbors complained to health officials twice in may and 
september about a stench from the grounds of puentes 
boardinghouse both times authorities found nothing in the yard 
the corpses had been in the ground as long as 10 months forensic 
anthropologists said puente blamed the smell on a fish emulsion 
fertilizer she said it was the fertilizer said neighbor will 
mcintyre another neighbor recalled that flies were always all 
over the place 
social security personnel apparently never determined whether 
the addressees of government payments cashed their benefit checks 
police said police said puente had authority to cash some but not 
all of the checks linked to the investigation 
after the first body was discovered at her home nov 11 puente 
was interviewed for several hours by sacramento detectives but she 
was allowed to walk to a nearby motel to meet a friend and was not 
seen again until her arrest wednesday in los angeles 
we had no reason to hold her there was no probable cause 
said police spokesman sgt bob burns you have to have a 
justification to arrest somebody it was the decision of the officer 
interviewing her that she should not be held 
there also was never any thought of placing her under 
surveillance burns said police chief john kearns called the 
decision not to follow her a judgment call and conceded that 
police made an error

walter slovekosky knew something was 
terribly wrong 20 years ago sunday when the headlights of his 
electric mine locomotive began blinking wildly 400 feet underground 
in consolidation coal cos no 9 mine 
i kept trying to call a foreman on the trolley phone to find 
out what was going on slovekosky said i waited and i waited 
but no one answered me 
thats when i told my buddy lets get out of here theres 
something bad wrong but we didnt know how bad 
slovekosky 70 and his brakeman were among 21 miners who made 
their way out of the smoky flamefilled labyrinth after the first 
of a series of methane explosions rocked the mine at 525 am on 
nov 20 1968 methane gas the major component of natural gas is a 
constant threat in coal seams 
seventyeight died in the explosions and fires which set in 
motion the landmark federal coal mine health and safety act passed 
by congress the next year 
you live through one of those nightmares ill tell you you 
never forget it said slovekosky who planned to mark the 
anniversary with a prayer sunday at a black stone memorial to the 
dead miners 
coal mining has been one of the nations most hazardous 
industrial occupations since the turn of the century more than 
20000 miners have died in accidents in west virginia alone 
twenty major explosions and many more minor ones rocked the 
mines 100 miles of tunnels for nine days 
the explosions threw the shafts elevator carriage into the air 
concrete blocks from the lamp house were hurled into the parking 
lot crushing parked automobiles smoke billowed 150 feet into the 
air 
a motel operator in fairmont 12 miles away felt the blast and 
thought the back of his motel was blowing up 
the coal company wanted to seal the mine slovekosky said 
they knew the situation was hopeless but the widows kept 
screaming you cant seal it you cant seal it 
finally they sealed the mine on nov 30 1968 to extinguish the 
fires feeding on methane and coal but officials of pittsburghbased 
consolidation coal vowed that all 78 bodies would be recovered 
the mine was reopened and recovery operations began in september 
1969 
sometimes i still lie in bed at night and think about it we 
know some of them didnt die instantly slovekosky said we 
found the miners sitting with their lunch pails open like they were 
just waiting to be rescued 
you wonder what would be going through your mind if you were 
sitting down there and you knew you were going to die 
but after consolidation coal spent nearly 10 years and 11 
million the search was abandoned in april 1978 with 19 men still 
missing because of deteriorating working conditions including water 
seepage 
millions of tons of coal will remain unmined because of federal 
and state orders and especially because of a miners tradition 
against taking coal from a mine when miners bodies are still inside 
all us widows tried to make them get all the men out said 
sara lee kaznoski whose husband pete j kaznoski sr is among 
those entombed in the mine i still feel they could have recovered 
all those men and given them a decent burial 
she and six other widows eventually agreed to accept the 
companys 10000 settlement offers plus joint title to more than 
250 acres of land 
it was a long war with many battles dont think it wasnt 
said kaznoski who lives in myrtle beach sc we got some laws 
passed and did a lot for the families of other miners even though 
it was too late for us 
slovekosky blamed the explosion on carelessness 
theyve never pointed a finger at anyone but whats the 
point he said its over a lot of people have died or moved 
away the problem was people were willing to take chances 
its like driving a car you keep taking chances somebodys 
going to get you sooner or later

two dolphins stranded in the swimming pool of 
a luxury hotel overlooking the nile for the past year are to be 
flown to an aquarium on the french riviera 
leo and nemo were brought to cairo from switzerland to perform 
for guests of the meridien hotel and were abandoned after their 
contract ended may 31 their swiss owner the international dolphin 
show co said it had nowhere to keep the mammals 
the two dolphins have become lethargic swimming in endless 
circles around the pool said edouard speck the hotels general 
manager 
we are now concerned with the safety of the animals he said 
we cant guarantee their safety and wellbeing in the pool they 
were becoming weak 
the two mammals are to be flown wednesday to the marine land 
aquarium in antibes on the southeast coast of france 
to prepare them for the trip the dolphins will be coated with 
grease so they can retain their moisture and will be strapped to 
hanging mats speck said british veterinarian david taylor who is 
preparing the animals for the transfer also has given them vitamins 
speck said the hotel plans to sue the international dolphin show 
co to determine who owns the dolphins 
this is not a confiscation he said we will go to court 
later to see whom the animals belong to who should pay their 
expenses i dont think they will return to the owner he cant take 
care of animals 
bruno lienhardt owner of the swiss company was traveling and 
unavailable for comment 
speck said he pressed egypts ministry of agriculture for 
permission to transfer the dolphins the dolphins will remain under 
the control of the egyptian government pending a court decision 
whenever the egyptian government wants them back they will 
have to come back he said 
leo and nimo born respectively in 1979 and 1980 were brought to 
the meridien in november 1987 their show was opened by president 
hosni mubaraks wife suzanne and was a big success especially 
during weekly performances for poor children 
after the summer season began in may the dolphins remained in 
the hotels main pool on a veranda overlooking the nile river 
guests had to use a smaller pool designed for winter use 
international dolphin show paid the dolphins expenses through 
last august since then the hotel has spent about 565 a month for 
the mammals two meals of frozen fish a day and weekly checkups by 
a veterinarian

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address 
im jim sasser united states senator from tennessee this week 
the worlds financial markets have registered strong doubts about 
americas resolve to deal with the massive budget deficits weve 
built up over the past eight years 
the message from london from tokyo and the other financial 
markets is clear the day of rhetoric and empty phrases is long 
past as a nation weve got to demonstrate a serious determination 
to get our financial house in order 
that message was reinforced just this past wednesday when the 
chairman of the federal reserve board offered a hobsons choice 
either we get on with the business of serious deficit reduction or 
else the federal reserve board will ratchet up interest rates and 
possibly induce a recession 
the markets the federal reserve theyre both putting the 
presidentelect and this congress on notice the declining dollar 
the onehundred dollar drop on wall street since election day the 
threat of higher interest rates those are the clearest possible 
indications that we must act and act now 
the emphasis is very much on our will to work together 
cooperatively as alan greenspan the chairman of the federal 
reserve board made clear the world isnt waiting to see what kind 
of plan were going to use to get the deficits down its waiting to 
see if there is any plan at all 
we all know it took a financial disaster of immense proportions 
to end the political posturing of nearly eight years only after the 
stock market crash of last october did the president finally agree 
to join the congress at the bargaining table the resulting 
bipartisan agreement reduced the deficit by some seventysix billion 
dollars over two years 
i know that i speak for many of my colleagues in the congress 
when i say that we want to work with the presidentelect towards the 
same positive result but we cant wait for the next financial 
disaster before we again take the budget deficit seriously 
congress just like the financial markets and the federal 
reserve is anxiously seeking a signal from the incoming 
administration that the era of ideological stalemate is over and the 
era of realistic deficit reduction has at long last begun 
now let me say this to presidentelect bush many of us in this 
congress are very experienced lip readers indeed we dont want new 
taxes anymore than you do 
we stand ready though to follow the presidents lead so long as 
that leadership aims honestly and forthrightly at solving this 
countrys number one economic problem 
in my judgment the presidentelect could begin to send the right 
signals to the world financial community and the congress by doing 
three simple things 
first he ought to give a fair hearing to the national economic 
commission its a distinguished group of experts established by 
the congress and the reagan administration to help reach a national 
consensus on the whole deficit problem 
and second he should meet prior to inauguration day with the 
leadership of both houses of the congress a meeting that should 
aim at getting to a common ground the objectives we all share in 
bringing the deficits down 
and finally he should get the reagan administration to submit a 
realistic budget to the congress this january not a scorchedearth 
budget that does away with needed domestic programs and certainly 
not a document that makes a shrill political statement but its 
dead on arrival in the halls of congress 
those are the kinds of meaningful actions that will command the 
confidence of the international financial community theyll help to 
put to rest the rumors of an early conflict between the congress and 
the presidentelect and i think theyll help prepare the way for an 
economic program that will set this country on a stable foundation 
a foundation of economic growth and continually improving living 
standards for all our people

iranian radio said saturday that former 
president jimmy carter wrote to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini offering 
to serve as a neutral american channel in efforts to free us 
hostages in lebanon and improve usiranian ties 
khomeini rejected the offer tehran radio said 
carter issued a statement in atlanta confirming he wrote a letter 
to khomeini but saying it was in response to an initiative from iran 
according to the radio report monitored in nicosia khomeini 
issued a statement denying any connection between iran and the 
hostages in lebanon just as i have said before the relationship 
of iran and the united states is like the relationship of the wolf 
and the lamb and between these two there can never be 
reconciliation the statement said 
the radio quoted carters letter as saying i hope that the 
american hostages in lebanon can be released as soon as possible 
this act would remove one of the main hurdles in the 
reestablishment of friendly relations between iran and the us 
carters statement read to the associated press by spokeswoman 
carrie harmon said in my note i was responding to an initiative 
from iran my purpose was to obtain the release of david rabhan a 
friend of mine who has been imprisoned in iran for almost nine years 
my hope is that in the name of justice and humanity iran will 
use its influence to encourage the release of all american hostages 
by working through normal channels 
ms harmon did not identify rabhan further or say why he was 
imprisoned she also said the full text of the letter would not be 
released 
fourteen foreigners including nine americans are held by 
lebanese shiite groups believed loyal to iran the hostage held 
longest is american terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the radio said the letter dated oct 30 was received by 
khomeinis office and that iranian experts confirmed it was carters 
handwriting 
to stop this effort from becoming politicized in our country 
and delaying the release of the hostages a neutral american channel 
must be used and we at the carter center are prepared to help in 
every appropriate manner the radio quoted the letter as saying 
the carter center opened in atlanta in 1986 houses carters 
presidential library as well as his office and is dedicated to 
research and discussion of public policy 
the radio quoted iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani as 
saying he also received a letter from carter about the hostages 
i myself received such a letter from carter alluding to the 
sinister politics of ties with iran and hostagetaking in lebanon 
the radio quoted rafsanjani as saying 
ties between the united states and iran were broken in 1979 when 
iranian militants stormed the us embassy in tehran and held 
diplomats hostage for 444 days carter has said the crisis which 
took place during his term as president led to his defeat by ronald 
reagan in the 1980 presidential elections 
the radio said khomeini ordered his letter made public in order 
to prevent any kind of exploitation it did not elaborate

president reagan signed legislation on saturday 
that imposes tough new penalties against contractors who have 
cheated the government 
the measure by making major procurement fraud a crime hands 
prosecutors a powerful new weapon to help protect the pentagons 
complex purchasing process 
the defense department has estimated that procurement fraud cost 
taxpayers 991 million in fiscal years 1986 and 1987 
under the new law those convicted of major fraud in government 
purchasing could earn prison sentences of up to 10 years and fined 
up to 10 million 
a person or corporation would be subject to penalties under the 
bill if convicted on a scheme or act to defraud the government in 
connection with a contract of at least 1 million 
the white house announced that reagan had signed the bill along 
with numerous other pieces of legislation the house and senate 
passed the measure in late october 
a statute of limitations of seven years would be established 
under the bill in contrast to the normal one of five years 
as well the measure includes socalled whistleblower 
protections to those drawing attention to major fraud 
a whistleblower protection provision allows anyone fired or 
punished for furnishing information to the government to sue for 
reinstatement and receive twice the amount of lost pay 
among other things the bill authorizes 8 million over four 
years for hiring additional prosecutors to handle fraud cases 
it also prohibits contractors from recovering legal expenses in 
proceedings were the contractors were found to engage in wrongdoing 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio the senate sponsor of bill said 
shortly after it was passed that the bill was needed because 
defense fraud rips off american taxpayers and endangers the lives 
of our fighting forces by providing them with defective parts

the irancontra prosecutor argued saturday that 
slightly differing views on congressional power should not cloud the 
central issues of lying and deceit in the criminal case against 
oliver l north 
independent counsel lawrence walsh said a justice department 
brief filed friday in us district court did not go to the heart of 
his case against north and instead was concerned with side issues of 
constitutional law and the separation of powers 
the justice department in its friendofthecourt brief argued 
that the case arose in the context of a policy dispute between the 
executive and legislative branches with respect to foreign affairs 
however walsh wrote in a brief filed saturday that the 
department had misinterpreted his arguments 
walsh maintained that the independent counsel was not trying to 
show that mere mere policy disagreements with congress are 
criminal or even that open defiance of enacted congressional 
restrictions on foreign military ventures would be criminal 
instead he continued norths actions became crimes when the 
former national security council aide lied to congress and tried to 
obstruct inquiries into his activities 
what converts a wrongful defiance of legal restrictions into 
criminal activity is the effort to defeat operation of the law 
through deceit craft or trickery or at least by means that are 
dishonest walsh wrote in the brief 
north is charged with conspiring illegally to divert profits from 
us arms sales to iran to the contra rebels in nicaragua also 
charged are former national security adviser john m poindexter 
arms dealer albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord 
north who is to be the first of the defendants to stand trial 
also is charged with 15 other felonies including lying to congress 
obstructing a presidential investigation and pocketing 90000 in 
travelers checks from the contras 
no trial date has been set 
walsh minimized his differences with the department concerning 
the lines of authority over foreign policy from the white house and 
capitol hill 
there is no substantial or relevant difference between the 
views of executive power expressed by the justice department and 
those advanced by the independent counsels memorandum walsh 
wrote 
to the the extent that the departments submission has assisted 
in clarifying those views we hope this exchange has been helpful to 
the court walsh wrote we equally hope however that the 
departments willingness to attribute divergent views to the 
prosecution has not obscured the issues in this case or the clear 
fact that the department has conspicuously failed to support any of 
the defendants constitutional claims 
however walsh pointedly referred to the public manner in which 
the justice department aired its disagreement with the prosecutor 
calling it wellpublicized advocacy 
we note that the departments memorandum was distributed to the 
press for presentation at a press conference before it was served on 
independent counsel or filed with the court said walsh who 
released his own arguments after filing them with the court and 
delivering a copy to the justice department

a male rice university student who was elected 
homecoming queen after entering the contest as a joke has decided to 
surrender his crown for a day and escort the runnerup to the cotton 
bowl 
michael grubbs was snubbed by university officials when he asked 
to be recognized during halftime ceremonies at rices homecoming 
football game and he also failed in his campaign to represent the 
school with other southwest conference homecoming queens at cotton 
bowl festivities on new years day 
so grubbs has agreed to serve as escort to his runnerup nancy 
jones riding a float during the annual dallas parade 
were both really psyched grubbs said were both ready to 
have a great time 
under cotton bowl rules host school arkansas will provide this 
years queen while the other southwest conference schhools will 
send princesses for the queens court 
cotton bowl bylaws specify that each princess should be a 
popular coed 
the homecoming queen election has often been taken lightly by 
rice students who previously have elected a dog and a refrigerator 
school officials reacted to the earlier elections by drafting a 
policy saying the homecoming queen is not necessarily the schools 
cotton bowl representative

said not all points raised in debates inspired by perestroika are 
constructive 
some are purely emotional and this has been causing some 
negative reactions gorbachev said in his first public comments on 
estonias challenge to the kremlin 
the country is thinking over what is happening gorbachev 
said in response to a reporters question during a visit to a 
monument honoring the late indian prime minister indira gandhi 
there is a lot of debate on how to approach the problem i am 
sure things will settle down gorbachev said what is happening 
in estonia is perestroika 
the parliament of estonia on wednesday passed a constitutional 
amendment asserting veto power over any new soviet laws parliament 
also declared sovereignty over all estonian matters except those 
involving defense and foreign affairs 
gorbachev said the problems in estonia and the other two baltic 
states latvia and lithuania would be dealt with as part of his 
program for social reform 
we will find a solution to problems of concern to various 
republics gorbachev said many things concern our friends for 
example in placing various industries there have been some 
mistakes there has been migration and some deterioration of 
environment 
by migration he meant an influx of ethnic russians into the 
baltic states 
gorbachevs comments made in russian and translated into english 
by an aide came after he had placed a wreath of red roses at a 
memorial to mrs gandhi on what would have been her 71st birthday 
later he accepted a peace award named in honor of mrs gandhi 
who was assassinated in 1984 he also conferred privately with mrs 
gandhis son and successor rajiv gandhi and attended the closing 
ceremony of a yearlong soviet cultural festival 
gorbachev used his speech accepting the award to criticize the 
united states and pakistan for their support of guerrillas fighting 
soviet troops and the sovietbacked government in afghanistan 
pakistan and the united states find it hard to accept new 
approaches to international affairs he said during the speech 
that was broadcast live and translated into english on indias 
staterun television 
he accused the two nations of creating obstacles for the geneva 
accord that provided for the withdrawal of about 100000 soviet 
troops from afghanistan by february 
their actions appear to indicate that they would like us to 
rescind those accords even though the grave consequences of that 
are obvious he said the danger inherent in it will soon make 
it comparable to a threat of nuclear holocaust or environmental 
catastrophe 
police have arrested more than 200 afghan refugees protesting 
gorbachevs visit to new delhi according to a prominent member of 
the refugee community of 7000 police confirmed afghans had been 
detained but refused to give any figures 
syed mohammad maiwand chairman of the international afghan 
elders association in new delhi said more than 150 afghans were 
arrested thursday night maiwand said 63 more people were detained 
during a demonstration outside a un office saturday 
police have ordered all afghans in the city to stay in their 
homes during gorbachevs visit 
during his speech gorbachev also spoke of the need for the 
soviet union china and india to have good relations 
we are pleased to see signs of improvement in indochinese 
relations our own relations with china are also evolving in an 
encouraging way he said 
both india and the soviet union have long had strained relations 
with china and india and china went to war in 1962 over a 
stillunresolved border dispute

president reagan signed legislation saturday 
that is intended to restore federal employees immunity from being 
sued for personal liability because of their actions on the job 
the bill does not apply to lawsuits seeking damages from 
government workers for alleged violations of constitutional rights 
for many years most federal employees were protected from 
personal liability or common law torts under various court 
decisions recognizing that immunity was necessary for them to 
perform their duties 
a supreme court decision last january had the effect of narrowing 
that immunity which would be restored under the bill that reagan 
signed saturday 
the bill provides that the exclusive remedy for personal 
liability lawsuits would be legal action against the federal 
government under the federal tort claims act 
the bill which passed congress by voice votes of the house and 
senate precludes all other civil actions for money damages based on 
a federal employees alleged negligent act

an estimated 240000 people defied a 
boycott called by the powerful tamil guerrilla group and voted 
saturday in the eastern province to choose members to a local 
administrative council 
indian soldiers provided heavy security around the polling 
centers to prevent attacks by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
the tamil militia that threatened to disrupt the voting 
there were no reports of violence during the voting but a sri 
lankan military official said two indian soldiers were killed friday 
when tamil gunmen attacked four police stations in the region 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said the attacks were an attempt to disrupt saturdays elections 
deputy election commissioner lakshman perera said an estimated 40 
percent of the 600000 voters in the region cast their ballots the 
polls are for 35 seats on a council joining the multiethnic eastern 
province with the predominantlytamil northern province 
the 36 seats in the north were won unopposed by two tamil groups 
that supported an indiasponsored peace accord aimed at ending the 
5yearold war for an independent tamil homeland 
at least 8500 people have been killed in the separatist war 
the accord signed in july 1987 provided for the setting up of 
semiautonomous provincial councils to appease the tamil demand for 
selfrule but the liberation tigers the largest and most powerful 
tamil militia rejected the plan saying it fell below expectations 
the polls saturday were being contested by the two tamil groups 
the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front and the eelam 
national democratic liberation front as well as the governing 
united national party and the sri lanka moslem congress results 
were not expected until sunday 
the liberation tigers denounced the tamil groups participating in 
the polls as traitors and said the elections were an indian 
propaganda ploy 
the tigers are fighting indian peacekeeping troops who were sent 
to sri lanka to disarm the guerrillas and enforce the peace accord 
india got involved in the ethnic conflict because of the 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils to the rebel cause 
the tigers say they need a separate homeland to protect their 
minority community from what they claim is discrimination by the 
majority sinhalese 
sinhalese who are mostly buddhists comprise 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people the mainly hindu tamils make up about 18 
percent of the population

getting over the river and through the woods to 
the family thanksgiving feast via ohare international airport 
always a challenge may be even tougher this year because of new 
federal flight limits 
and things dont look much better for christmas say travel 
agents airline and aviation officials 
were routinely advising our customers and clients of the 
lets say congestion problems at major airports particularly 
ohare said david powell american express travel service vice 
president 
the new federal aviation administration limits on the number of 
flights allowed to arrive at ohare in a given hour are likely to 
aggravate the problem at the nations busiest airport 
following a startling 150 percent increase in the number of 
errors by air traffic controllers at ohare this year the faa in 
october ordered the airport to cut the number of arrivals from 96 
per hour to 80 per hour between peaktravel times of 445 pm and 
915 pm 
while the cutbacks called a flow control program were 
designed to make skies safer airlines acknowledge they also have 
increased tardiness in a system in which delays never were uncommon 
we have seen a definite impact from the flow control program 
said spokesman tom stack of american airlines the secondlargest 
carrier at ohare 
to give some example in october of 1987 at ohare we were 
above 95 percent in our arrivals within 15 minutes that dropped to 
about 75 percent in october of this year 
airlines also no longer have a reserve of planes to help 
accommodate heavy holiday traffic said united airlines spokesman 
joe hopkins 
while the number of flights over the holiday wont be up much 
about 2300 total arrivals and departures per day the number of 
people in the skies will be as airlines see their planes filled to 
capacity 
stack anticipates that sometime over the fourday thanksgiving 
weekend american will top its previous oneday record of more than 
30000 passengers flown out of ohare 
passengers ought to look forward to having some delays both 
in the air and on the ground he said adding that sunday may be 
worst of all people can choose a variety of days to begin 
vacation but pretty much they wind up returning on that sunday 
assuming clear skies the airlines said travelers should find the 
delays manageable but if the weather declines to cooperate 
everything is up for grabs 
sixty percent of your delays are related to weather said faa 
spokesman mort edelstein in chicago 
the new faa limitations were imposed after the number of 
controller errors reached 30 far exceeding the 12 reported at 
ohare in all of 1987 four of the errors occurred over a period of 
a week edelstein said 
even with the new limits theres no perfect flow control 
edelstein said some hours well take 82 arrivals per hour we 
are liberal with the 80 an hour when it has to be 
some feel the cutbacks dont go far enough 
the airlines schedule so many fights at certain times in and 
out that the airport cant handle them said david shuler a 
controller at ohare and a representative of the national air 
traffic control association theres only so many taxiways the 
aircraft can be on 
shuler said the longterm solution is 30 more controllers at 
ohare 
the shortterm answer for travelers 
avoid key peak times and dont put off travel plans till the 
last minute said powell of american express

the supreme court has sentenced a man to be shot by 
firing squad for leading a mob that killed seven people in ethnic 
riots this year a witness said saturday 
kuryun naganpetyan a moscowbased armenian activist and painter 
said the verdict against akhmed i akhmedov from the republic of 
azerbaijan was handed down shortly after 6 pm friday 
it was the first death penalty issued by soviet courts in 
connection with the feb 28 riots in the azerbaijan city of sumgait 
soviet officials say 32 people including 26 armenians were 
killed in the unrest armenians have set the toll much higher 
in may an azerbaijani metalworker talekh salekh ogli ismailov 
was found guilty by a court in azerbaijan of committing premeditated 
murder in sumgait and given a 15year prison sentence 
staterun media in moscow did not immediately report the verdict 
in the akhmedov trial which was closed to western journalists 
naganpetyan who has attended the trial daily reported the courts 
decision in a telephone interview with the associated press 
the riots in sumgait were sparked by a campaign by armenians who 
are mostly christian to annex the predominantly armenian region of 
nagornokarabakh which has been part of largely moslem azerbaijan 
since 1923 
more than 80 people have been charged with criminal offenses in 
the antiarmenian unrest that broke out in sumgait an industrial 
city on the caspian sea about 20 miles north of azerbaijans 
capital baku 
akhmedov and two codefendants ilgam a ismailov and yavar g 
dzhafarov went on trial at the supreme court on murder and arson 
charges oct 18 tass the official news agency said the three were 
charged with organizing and taking a direct part in mass disorders 
accompanied by pogroms acts of arson and murders 
naganpetyan said akhmedov was convicted of using a megaphone to 
shout to a mob kill the armenians and of leading them as they 
stormed 17 apartments in sumgait and killed seven people burning 
some of them alive 
armenian newspapers whose reporters have been allowed into the 
trial have said that according to testimony bands of azerbaijanis 
in sumgait hunted down and killed armenians and that one man was 
hurled alive into a bonfire 
one young girl was mutilated with a shovel and burned alive 
according to accounts of the supreme court trial that have appeared 
in the armenian press 
the guilty verdict and death sentence came as a shock to 
akhmedov naganpetyan said 
visibly he didnt expect to be found guilty his face 
dissolved when he was told he would be shot and he turned away 
naganpetyan said it was a great contrast to the first part of the 
day when he behaved like a hero 
the armenian activist said the supreme court did not announce 
when akhmedov would be executed he said the trial of akhmedovs 
codefendants ismailov and dzhafarov is continuing 
other trials of suspects charged in the sumgait riots have been 
held but official media have not reported on them even armenias 
communist party chief suren arutyunyan has complained about the 
way the cases are being handled 
we see how the obviously delayed investigation reopened old 
wounds how people are shaken by the fact that the legal examination 
is being conducted in various cities of the country and that no 
information is coming into the republic about who was punished what 
the sentence was arutyunyan said in an oct 8 speech carried on 
armenian television 
under the soviet criminal code the death penalty can be applied 
for offenses ranging from murder to war crimes and largescale 
economic crimes against the state such as embezzlement of 
government property or taking bribes 
nazi war criminal feodor federenko was executed on july 27 1987

antimarxist guerrillas and cuban forces in 
angola are holding peace talks and have informally agreed not to 
attack each other while they await results of a regional peace plan 
rebel leader jonas savimbi said 
savimbi head of the national union for the total independence of 
angola or unita told reporters at his bush headquarters friday his 
group met representatives of cuban president fidel castro on aug 26 
at the meeting which was called to turn over two of 17 cuban 
officers captured by unita during fighting with angolas cuban and 
sovietbacked government savimbi said delegates arranged a tacit 
understanding that if we dont harass them they wont attack us 
savimbi said castro asked for another meeting to discuss a system 
of communications by which the us and south africanbacked unita 
will know if cubans are part of a government convoy and can avoid 
attacking them 
he said cubans have not attacked his forces for some time but 
claimed soviet personnel had engaged in fighting 
the cubans are staying behind they are not playing a major 
role they are not visible savimbi said 
later in an interview with the associated press savimbi said he 
has agreed to a us proposal to provide food to civilians on the 
government side of the angolan civil war he said his only condition 
was that americans be allowed into northern angola to make sure the 
food goes to civilians and not government soldiers 
the guerrilla leader said presidentelect george bush had 
promised him before and after the us election that us support to 
unita would continue until the soviets stop supplying the angolan 
government and 50000 cuban troops leave the nation 
at the news conference savimbi said south african president pw 
botha had invited him to a meeting in pretoria on wednesday to 
discuss a usmediated peace plan designed to get cuban troops out 
of angola and end south african rule over southwest africa also 
known as namibia 
on friday the angolan and cuban governments formally approved 
the tentative peace accord south africas cabinet is expected to 
discuss the matter in a few days 
negotiators from angola cuba and south africa under us 
mediation agreed tuesday in geneva to submit a timetable to their 
respective governments for the redeployment to the north of the 
country and ultimate pullout of the cuban troops south africa says 
agreement on a cuban withdrawal is a precondition for allowing 
independence for namibia 
savimbi said he did not care how long the cubans take to leave 
as long as they all go he is confident that without cuban support 
the marxist angolan forces would have no choice but to negotiate 
with him on a reconciliation government leading to free elections 
which he believes he would win 
the guerrilla leader said that unlike antigovernment rebels in 
afghanistan who have attacked the retreating soviet army his rebels 
would leave departing cuban troops alone the best victory is to 
allow the enemy to go he said 
unita has been fighting for a share of power since shortly after 
angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
the groups intelligence chief gen peregrino wambo said that 
in the past month 48 unita soldiers had died while the angolan 
government has lost 531 men and the cubans 12

members will strike monday if the newspaper does not offer them a 
raise 
negotiations broke off friday the newspaper plans to continue 
publishing if there is a strike the guilds previous contract with 
the suntimes expired june 1 
negotiators for the newspaper proposed that the next meeting take 
place monday morning but the union wanted weekend meetings and had 
not decided whether to accept guild spokesman charles nicodemus 
said saturday 
some significant progress had been made during the week but 
the guild refused to meet again monday said michael soll 
suntimes spokesman he said management had told the union several 
weeks ago that no talks could be held this weekend because of prior 
commitments 
the union which represents 250 suntimes reporters editors 
photographers and support staff had not set a specific time for a 
strike 
we only said monday guild spokesman thomas gibbons said 
friday we will set the time probably on sunday 
the company is still seeking pay cuts night differential 
cuts and eight exemptions from union jurisdiction said gibbons 
we are a long way from settlement and there has to be a pay 
raise 
the newspaper originally asked guild members to take a 15 percent 
pay cut gibbons said 
by friday he said the suntimes was seeking a 3 percent salary 
cut for 18 months of a threeyear pact followed by restoration of 
current pay levels 
management also wanted to trim the differential paid for working 
night and earlymorning shifts from 10 percent to 6 percent he said 
soll said he was not at liberty to discuss any details 
he said the company had filed an unfair laborpractice charge 
against the guild with the national labor relations board and said 
the allegation was under investigation the complaint concerned 
aspects of the unions conduct last week said soll who would not 
elaborate

suntimes last week reminding them of the 1985 tribune strike and 
saying that many of the tribunes former employees will never work 
there again we dont want those kinds of problems for the 
suntimes 
religion writer daniel lehmann said the letter was an obvious 
threat of job loss

president augusto pinochet on saturday 
warned opposition leaders to stop pushing for constitutional reforms 
and threatened to void the results of a referendum requiring him to 
hold open elections a government news agency said 
in a dispatch from the southern city of coiyhaique the agency 
orbe quoted pinochet as saying opposition leaders had failed to heed 
his calls that they abide by the constitution his military 
government drafted in 1980 
i have asked them if they accept the constitution but they 
remain silent he was quoted as saying if they say no the 
plebescite is null 
the statement made at a breakfast meeting with women supporters 
in coiyhaique was intended to elaborate on a comment by pinochet on 
friday that the opposition would have to live with the 
consequences if they failed to respect the constitution orbe said 
in the oct 5 ballot voters rejected a proposal by pinochet and 
other military commanders that he remain in office until 1997 as a 
result according to the provisions of the constitution he must 
call open elections planned for december 1989 and hand over power 
to the winner in march 1990 
leaders of a 15party opposition coalition which led the 
campaign for pinochets defeat at the polls have called for several 
amendments to the constitution 
they object to provisions that would allow the president to 
appoint nearly onethird of the senate and which give the military 
a majority of seats on an influential national security council 
they also object to an article that prohibits all propagation of 
marxist philosophy 
they say the constitutional reforms are needed to assure full 
democratic powers for the new elected government 
pinochet has firmly rejected the proposed reforms the fiercely 
anticommunist army commander who will be 73 next week seized 
power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of a 
marxist president salvador allende during a period of economic and 
social upheaval 
saturdays comments came at the end of a fourday tour of chiles 
far south coiyhaique is about 950 miles south of santiago the 
nations capital 
in the breakfast meeting pinochet also said the referendums 
outcome was not a triumph for the opposition because he managed 
to win more than 3 million votes after 15 years of government 
according to orbe he said the vote left him like a 
muchpunched boxer but it the effects passed quickly ive 
recuperated 
he told supporters that in the upcoming elections you have to 
act aggressively but in the best sense of the word which is to say 
with initiative to assure victory for conservative forces 
in the elections voters are to choose not only a president but a 
civilian congress the legislature was disbanded and replaced by a 
military junta when pinochet seized power

weeks ago to republican george bush 
but they also heard a warning from former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt that they must stop treating campaigns for the white house 
like an extension of a congressional campaign and start offering 
a larger vision of the future 
we assume that what elects a senator will elect a president 
that what wins the statehouse will win the white house said 
babbitt whose bid for the democratic presidential nomination ended 
after the new hampshire primary 
he said the democrats success in electing members of congress 
and governors makes it even harder to swallow that once again 
the biggest prize the presidency has eluded our grasp 
he said that voters regard the presidency as about the larger 
issues of personal leadership and national destiny to become a 
presidential party we must have a vision of what america can become 
and the credibility to be heard 
as an example he cited a phrase often used by dukakis 
good jobs for good wages may be a good slogan but it is not a 
policy much less a program said babbitt 
he said the democrats must offer voters an economic message of 
growth and renewal not just equity and redistribution and a 
foreign and defense policy that acknowledges that in an imperfect 
world we must sometimes project and use force 
kirks term as party chairman expires in february and he had 
indicated he had no desire to serve another four years 
but many party leaders apparently eager to avoid a potentially 
divisive battle for the post have pleaded with him to stay on 
asked if that included the two men on the national ticket kirk 
said senator bentsen did and governor dukakis asked me what i was 
thinking about and i told him it was a serious and major decision 
different from the course i had set out on he said i hope you 
stay on 
jackson was not among those urging kirk to seek a another term 
the pressure on kirk was perceived as a strategy for blocking 
jackson from increasing his influence within the national party 
structure 
kirk said that if he decides to seek another term it would only 
be to try to do a better job and not to prevent any conflict 
or be an obstacle in any other persons way 
he said that if any of his backers were trying to block jackson 
they havent mentioned it to me 
ron brown a washington lawyer who played a key role in the late 
stage of the jackson presidential campaign was the only potential 
candidate for party chairman who refused to commit himself to 
dropping out of the race if kirk decides to run 
i dont feel obligated to say im not going to take another 
breath until he decides what to do said brown who emphasized 
that he and kirk had worked closely together in the past 
if kirk runs for another term brown said obviously it makes 
it more difficult obviously it makes it less likely that brown 
would enter the race 
he said it was a very unfair characterization to describe him 
as jacksons man in the contest i would suggest the next chairman 
of the party had better have a good relationship with jesse because 
hes going to be around for a long time brown added 
party leaders from the northeastern states backed kirks 
reelection as the mechanic the generalist the builder and 
spokesperson this party needs said samuel shipley their chairman

president reagan has signed legislation 
approving a complex deal between a florida man and the federal 
government in which some 107800 acres of florida swampland will be 
swapped for a valuable piece of downtown phoenix ariz 
the white house announced that reagan signed the legislation on 
friday congress approved the deal in october 
the bill authorizes the interior department to dispose of the 
104acre tract of arizona land known as the phoenix indian school 
which the reagan administration wants to close because of declining 
enrollments 
the general accounting office the investigative wing of 
congress has described the downtown phoenix land as perhaps the 
most valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the west 
critics have charged that the government could have sold the 
arizona land on the open market and earned tens of millions dollars 
more for the taxpayers while the florida land is protected by law 
against development anyway 
under the plan barron collier and the collier family interests 
of florida will get 684 acres of the phoenix property in exchange 
for the florida acreage and a cash payment of at least 349 million 
the transaction also calls for the veterans administration to get 
115 acres of the school property to expand its phoenix hospital 
phoenix to get 20 acres for a park and arizona to get 45 acres for 
a veterans home the rest of the land is tied up in road 
rightsofway 
the money paid by the colliers will be placed into a trust fund 
for the education of indians in arizona 
the florida land will be used to provide a buffer around the 
everglades and to provide habitat for endangered species such as 
the florida panther 
the house voted 31632 approval of a package of bills in which 
the phoenix deal was included the senate gave final approval in 
late october 
the florida property is in collier county in southwest florida 
the bulk of the 108000 acres lies immediately north of the big 
cypress national preserve which borders everglades national park on 
the parks northwest side 
another parcel of 5000 acres is adjacent to the fakahatchee 
strand state preserve known home to about a fifth of the 30 to 50 
florida panthers believed left in the wilderness the state preserve 
is west of the national preserve 
another 19620 acres is next to the states cape romanoten 
thousand islands aquatic preserve on the gulf coast south of naples 
and west of everglades city 
at the time the house granted its approval reps sidney yates 
dill chairman of the appropriations interior subcommitee and 
george miller dcalif chairman of the interior water and power 
resources subcommittee sharply criticized the deal 
yates and miller argued that taxpayers would get a better deal if 
the property were sold on the open market contending at least one 
appraiser found the phoenix land to be worth 100 million more than 
that attached to it in the exchange 
the legislation was sponsored principally by interior committee 
chairman morris udall dariz 
this is a cushy cozy deal for the colliers said yates if 
it were not mo udalls bill it would be laughed off the floor 
miller argued that while the florida land is environmentally 
sensitive and a good federal acquisition it already is protected 
from any damaging development by federal law

chief justice william rehnquist joined 
more than 2000 people who gathered saturday to mark the 125th 
anniversary of president abraham lincolns gettysburg address 
honoring the men who fought here in the civil war 
rehnquist noted that although lincolns speech endures it was 
not the focus of the nov 19 1863 dedication of part of the 
gettysburg battlefield as a national cemetery 
edward everett the nationally known orator was the featured 
speaker and spoke for nearly two hours rehnquist said lincoln 
was invited only to make a few remarks yet everetts oration is 
forgotten but lincolns remarks will live forever 
people in period dress lined the streets near the towns train 
depot awaiting the arrival of a man portraying lincoln and his 
entourage on the stroudsburg railroad 
as the dignitaries climbed off the train more than 2000 people 
dressed as civil war troops and townspeople of the era kicked off 
the celebration making a parade to the national cemetery where 
lincoln gave the famed speech 
state police estimated more than 5000 spectators huddled in the 
freezing rain to hear james a getty portraying lincoln repeat the 
270word speech that begins four score and seven years ago 
you knew he was an actor but it was still thrilling said 
sunbury resident jean marquette who was not bothered by the bad 
weather i got goose bumps 
rehnquist spoke of lincoln as a great statesman and masterful 
speech writer 
from contemporary descriptions of lincoln he was not what one 
would think of as a great speaker rehnquist said his voice was 
highpitched and his tall lanky appearance gave an impression of 
awkwardness but abraham lincoln was a master of the english 
language 
he was not just articulate he was able to convey ideas in 
simple terms and yet with force and sometimes passion rehnquist 
said

president reagan has signed into law a 
halfdozen bills passed in the final days of the 100th congress 
including legislation calling for stiffer penalties against insider 
trading and contractors who cheat the government 
the white house announced the bill signings on saturday although 
some took place earlier in the week 
the bills signed by reagan also concerned benefits to veterans 
who are alcoholics protection of federal workers from liability 
lawsuits because of actions taken on the job and approval of an 
unusual land deal involving florida and arizona 
the law on insider trading was designed to counter the wave of 
scandal that rocked wall street several years ago and shook the 
confidence of the nations investors 
the measure doubles the maximum criminal penalties for insider 
trading from five years in jail to 10 years and boosts fines from 
500000 to 25 million for a company and from 100000 to 1 
million for an individual 
it also holds companies liable to fines for the actions of their 
employees if the firms knowingly or recklessly fail to detect 
and prevent insider trading 
here is a summary of other bills that became law 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the measure makes major government procurement fraud a federal 
crime and imposes tough new penalties against contractors who have 
cheated the government it is aimed at giving prosecutors new powers 
to deal especially with fraud involving pentagon contracting 
the defense department has estimated that procurement fraud cost 
taxpayers 991 million in fiscal years 1986 and 1987 
under the new law those convicted of major fraud in government 
purchasing could be given prison sentences of up to 10 years and 
fined up to 10 million 
</TEXT>

the law overrides a supreme court decision that had allowed the 
veterans administration to deny benefits to veterans who were 
alcoholics because it considered alcoholism a product of willful 
misconduct 
under the new law the va when considering the granting of 
benefits is compelled to consider chronic alcoholism a disease as 
has been generally accepted in the medical community 
last april the supreme court denying a claim from two veterans 
that they had unlawfully been denied benefits concluded that the va 
was not compelled to consider chronic alcoholism a disease 
reagan also signed legislation providing a 41 percent 
costofliving increase in the compensation paid to nearly 22 
million veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and to about 
323000 surviving spouses and dependents of veterans who died of 
servicerelated causes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the law restores immunity to federal employees so they cannot be 
sued for personal liability because of their actions on the job 
a supreme court decision last january had the effect of narrowing 
the immunity for such workers but the new law restores the 
traditional protection for workers which had been established 
previously by various court decisions 
the new law does not apply to lawsuits seeking damages from 
government workers for alleged violations of constitutional rights

opec oil ministers tried in a second day 
of private talks saturday to break a deadlock between iran and iraq 
over a new pact to bolster the falling price of crude oil 
officials from louisiana texas and other energyproducing us 
states made a pitch for the ministers to iron out their differences 
the states have been hurt by falling oil prices laid to production 
increases by members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
theyve got to get iraq back into the quota system thats 
pretty obvious said kent hance texas railroad commissioner if 
they dont were facing some real problems in the producing states 
in the united states 
iraq is the only one of 13 opec members that has refused to join 
the 1986 production accord because it wants a quota equal to that of 
bitter enemy iran 
under the current quota system iran has a ceiling of 24 million 
barrels a day it is larger than the proposed 15 million for iraq 
because iran has a larger domestic oil market 
the two countries agreed to a ceasefire in their 8yearold war 
in august they would now like more oil revenues to help rebuild 
their battered economies 
subroto of indonesia who serves as secretarygeneral for opec 
said saturday that the ministers probably would have to check with 
their governments before an agreement could be reached 
we can say that lots of progress has been made in trying to 
work out major problems that we are facing he told reporters 
saturday he added however we have to be realistic enough that 
very likely we need some consultations with our governments 
his remarks raised the possibility the ministers might have to 
return home for further instructions 
subroto spoke after a 40minute meeting of two committees of the 
oil group before the meeting ministers from iran and iraq met 
separately with other ministers in an attempt to reach a compromise 
subroto said the ministers would again meet in small groups 
sunday and report to opecs regularly scheduled winter meeting on 
monday all 13 oil ministers will attend those talks 
the dispute between iran and iraq is the major stumbling block to 
a new arrangement that would set limits on how much oil each country 
can produce daily 
analysts say opec members boosted production in an effort to 
improve their negotiating position at these meetings 
the current production accord sets total output at about 15 
million barrels a day total opec production in october was 
estimated by the international energy agency at nearly 211 million 
barrels the highest monthly level in more than five years 
with soaring production prices have tumbled sharply below opecs 
benchmark of 18 a barrel 
samuel b nunez jr president of the louisiana state senate 
said saturday that 15 a barrel represents a good benchmark he 
called it a price the industry can live with consumers can live 
with and a price that does justice to the producing states 
the us officials who said they were wellreceived by opec 
representatives met with kuwaiti oil minister ali khalifa sabah and 
subroto the officials said they would also meet with oil ministers 
rilwanu lukman of nigeria and hisham nazer of saudi arabia 
hance said the us delegation included 14 people from louisiana 
arkansas texas oklahoma and alaska

a hawaiian airlines jumbo jet flew 368 miles off 
course on a flight from los angeles to honolulu and an air national 
guard surveillance crew has been credited with saving the flight 
before it ran out of fuel 
a commendation memo to the guard crew said it was highly likely 
the l1011 tristar could have bypassed the hawaiian islands on nov 
7 and not had enough fuel to make landfall but the crew spotted it 
in time on radar and gave warning 
hawaii is the most isolated landmass on earth 
the plane heading west was detected 368 miles north of oahu 
island where honolulu is located five minutes after its scheduled 
arrival time at honolulu international airport the national guard 
said 
the surveillance crew determined that the plane was hawaiian 
flight 471 and notified the diamond head air traffic control center 
which instructed the pilot to turn south the national guard said 
other details of the flight such as the number of passengers and 
the fuel level upon landing were not available saturday 
the memo outlining the incident implied problems with the planes 
navigational instruments may have led the aircraft off course 
we received a report from the faa federal aviation 
administration that one of our planes was off course keoni 
wagner the airlines public relations manager said friday we 
werent aware of it because we didnt show any such incident with 
our instruments it didnt show any such deviation 
airline officials said the case was still under investigation and 
would not say if anyone had been disciplined for the flight error 
surveillance crews monitor hawaiian airspace 24 hours a day said 
national guard spokesman maj richard shimomuro

two moderate earthquakes rocked northern 
utah from salt lake city to the idaho border on saturday causing 
minor damage in at least two cities authorities said 
the larger quake had a magnitude of 5 on the richter scale and 
occurred about 1245 pm mst it was followed 20 minutes later by a 
temblor of magnitude 46 both were located near the utahidaho 
border about three miles west of bear lake said seismologist sue 
nava of the university of utah seismograph stations 
residents in logan and ogden reported minor damage including 
cracked windows and loosened masonry 
nava said the earthquake was the largest recorded in utah since 
aug 14 when a temblor of magnitude 5 was reported 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 55 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 45

hundreds of thousands of flagwaving 
serbs rallied saturday for greater control over the troubled 
province of kosovo while their opponents thronged the provincial 
capital in a rally of their own 
helmeted riot police closed all roads leading into kosovos 
capital pristina saturday to keep ethnic albanians from converging 
on the city protesters who numbered at least 20000 had mostly 
dispersed by midnight said police officers speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the police actions later reported on belgrade television 
followed a warning on the state news agency tanjug that 
extraordinary measures could be taken if the crowds in pristina 
250 miles south of belgrade did not disperse 
it was the third straight day of street protests in pristina 
triggered by the forced resignations of two ethnic albanian 
communist leaders 
however kosovos acting party president told reporters later 
saturday the communist leadership had decided to use exclusively 
political measures to ease the tension and held out the 
possibility that the resignations would be reviewed 
should it be determined that mistakes were committed in 
carrying this out they the resignations will be annulled party 
president remzi koljgeci told reporters 
the mostly young crowds had earlier ignored several warnings from 
local communist party leaders to leave tanjug and kosovos 
communist leadership said the situation worsened from hour to 
hour 
serbias communist party leader slobodan milosevic claimed 
saturdays rally in belgrade was the largest in yugoslavias post 
world war ii history the crowd chanted in support 
serbias drive for change in kosovo is a process that nobody 
will be able to stop any longer by any force milosevic told the 
crowd 
we enter this battle as we enter all battles to win he 
added recalling serbias defeats of german armies in world war i 
and world war ii 
trouble erupted in kosovo on thursday when two ethnic albanian 
communist leaders azem vlasi and kacusa jasari were forced to 
resign under pressure from milosevic 
about 15000 workers and students rallied in a pristina sports 
hall and later joined a swelling crowd of tens of thousands outside 
the local communist party headquarters 
we have given our word that we shall lay down our lives for 
kosovo cried the fistshaking flagwaving masses contradicting 
milosevics claims that the provinces ethnic albanian leaders had 
no popular support 
highlevel officials from the national communist party were 
dispatched from belgrade to the southern region bordering albania 
but the crowds demanded a visit from stipe suvar leader of the 
national communist party he is widely perceived to oppose 
milosevics populist methods 
tanjug reported local security officials held an emergency 
meeting attended by vlasi 
remzi koljgeci acting head of kosovos communist party said the 
situation in pristina was more complicated than on friday when an 
estimated 70000 ethnic albanians roamed the city for hours 
the simmering tension between the ethnic albanian majority in 
kosovo and the provinces serb and montenegrin minorities erupted in 
violence in 1981 when nine people died in clashes between police 
and albanians demanding more independence from serbia 
martial law was then briefly imposed in kosovo which is 
administratively part of serbia the largest of yugoslavias six 
republics 
the 1974 constitution granted broad autonomy to kosovo an 
ancient serbian heartland where ethnic albanians now form 90 percent 
of the population 
milosevic wants the constitution changed to give serbia more 
control over the provinces security educational and judicial 
systems 
he argues this would protect the slav minority there from alleged 
harassment by the ethnic albanians 
saturdays rally in belgrade postponed three times out of 
apparent fear it would drive ethnic tension out of control was 
billed as the high point of milosevics campaign 
hailed by his supporters as a strong leader and heir to the late 
president tito milosevic is feared by nonserb communist leaders 
who dislike his populist style and worry his drive for more control 
in kosovo will increase the serbian say in national affairs 
organizers estimated 13 million people attended the rally on the 
banks of the sava river milosevic asserted it was the biggest 
gathering since hundreds of thousands poured onto belgrade streets 
to celebrate liberation from the nazis in 1944 
independent observers gave much lower estimates for the crowds 
who streamed into belgrade on free buses and trains or on foot 
despite some fiery speeches saturdays rally was much flatter in 
atmosphere than many expected with the crowd dispersing quickly and 
peacefully afterward as heavy rain began falling 
milosevics fighting talk was balanced by two appeals to the 
ethnic albanians to unite with serbs and work for the peaceful 
dream of the two groups living in harmony in kosovo 
milosevic also called for support of political and economic 
reforms outlined by yugoslavias communist leadership to overcome 
the economic crisis that has helped fuel ethnic and worker unrest

portauprince haiti ap haitis ruler lt gen prosper 
avril has invited political leaders to participate in a ceremony 
marking the electionday massacre of voters in november 1987 a 
radio report said saturday 
in an open letter to civic and political leaders avril suggested 
that all haitians were responsible for the massacre that ended the 
nations first chance at democratic elections after almost three 
decades of rule by the duvalier family

massacre on nov 29 when thugs shot and hacked to death at least 34 
voters at polling stations the independent station radio haiti 
inter reported 
once again possessed by the old demons which over the centuries 
have caused us grief the sons of the nation let themselves be 
pitted one against the other said the haitian ruler who replaced

soldiers on sept 17

no one sylvio claude a frontrunner presidential candidate in the 
aborted elections told the associated press saturday

culprits were arrested and tried 
though the massacre was carried out in daylight by unmasked 
gunmen as soldiers watched in trucks without interfering no one has 
been arrested or punished 
soldiers who helped bring avril to power said they are sickened 
by acts of statesponsored violence avril has pledged to return

republican govelect judd gregg on saturday 
denounced a federal order that could speed licensing of the stalled 
seabrook nuclear power plant and suggested that gov john sununu 
helped get president reagan to sign it 
sununu a staunch advocate of the plant who on thursday was named 
presidentelect george bushs chief of staff denied any involvement 
and said through a spokesman he didnt anticipate the order 
the governor was totally taken by surprise by it said 
spokesman jerry little 
the executive order released by the white house on friday gives 
the federal emergency management agency broad new powers to carry 
out evacuation plans for nuclear power plants that have been unable 
to obtain commercial licenses because of state or local governmental 
opposition 
the 57 billion seabrook reactor was completed more than two 
years ago but remains unlicensed mainly because massachusetts 
refuses to cooperate in emergency planning for six communities 
within 10 miles of the plant 
seabrook spokesman ron sher said saturday the executive order may 
have come too late to help speed licensing for the plant he noted 
that seabrook has put together its own emergency response 
organization for massachusetts and that fema gave the organization 
passing grades during an exercise in june 
were very far along in the licensing process sher said 
im not sure the order helps us very much we may not need 
help 
nevertheless the order provoked an outcry from opponents of 
seabrook and the similarly stalled shoreham reactor in new york 
which are the only two plants facing conditions that would be 
covered by the order 
gregg a fourterm congressman who replaces sununu on jan 5 
supports seabrook if federal regulators determine that its 
evacuation plans are safe but after a draft of the executive order 
surfaced in june gregg and the other three members of new 
hampshires congressional delegation met with reagan to tell him 
they opposed it 
the decision to sign the fema order reflects a change in policy 
which is totally inappropriate and a mistake gregg said saturday 
through spokesman brian grip 
it will as i told the president last summer create at the 
minimum a perception that the process for approving safety 
requirements for nuclear power plants has been fundamentally changed 
in midstream gregg said 
this action which i strongly disagree with has obviously been 
influenced by new pressures in washington gregg added the way 
in which this order was resurrected and floated through the back 
channels of the white house is totally inappropriate especially in 
light of the concerns already expressed by the new hampshire 
congressional delegation 
gregg did not return a message grip passed along seeking 
elaboration on his remarks 
through spokesman little sununu said any inference that he was 
involved in reviving the order is absolutely incorrect 
i havent heard or spoken about that issue to anyone in the 
last two or three months and i thought it wasnt going to come to 
pass because it was now being considered unnecessary as the nuclear 
regulatory commission licensing process is moving along well for 
seabrook sununu said 
sununu also referred to a recent nrc rule change upheld by a 
federal court in september that says utilities may submit their own 
emergency plans for reluctant governments the rule change presumes 
reluctant government officials would follow the utility plans in a 
real emergency 
when the draft of the executive order surfaced a washington 
source told the associated press that sununu was up to his 
eyeballs in this thing sununu has denied originating the idea or 
lobbying heavily for it 
white house spokesman bj cooper when read greggs remarks 
saturday said the proposed order has been under review for 
months it had nothing to do with what you said 
cooper said sununu had discussions with the white house staff 
several months ago on the proposed order but i didnt say he 
lobbied heavily cooper also noted that some congressmen and 
senators also had spoken with white house staff members about the 
issue

a animal rights activist accused of 
planting a bomb outside a company that demonstrates surgical tools 
on dogs and then kills them says she only wanted to scare the 
companys chairman 
it would have been purposeless to kill him fran trutt was 
quoted as saying in an interview published in the advocate of 
stamford on sunday but to scare him at this time might have 
affected some change as there are surgical supply companies that 
are not torturing dogs or other animals in any way shape or form 
and their products are working just as well for humans 
trutt 33 faces attempted murder charges for allegedly planting 
a radiocontrolled pipe bomb outside us surgicals headquarters on 
nov 11 police said the bomb was found near a parking space used by 
the companys chairman leon hirsch 
us surgical a company founded by hirsch 24 years ago is the 
nations largest supplier of surgical staplers company officials 
teach doctors how to use the devices in instructional sessions 
involving between 700 and 900 dogs each year company officials said 
stray dogs previously destined to be put to death are used the dogs 
are anesthetized before they are operated on and are destroyed 
before they awaken 
in the interview from the connecticut correctional institution at 
niantic trutt also said she was acting alone and that she did not 
make the bomb 
she claimed however that her actions are being hailed by animal 
rights activists 
i am not the only who feels this way she said others are 
willing to take action to affect a change so that this live torture 
will stop 
some animal rights groups including one that had petitioned 
state health authorities to stop the experimentation at us 
surgical have disassociated themselves with trutt and emphasized 
that they oppose violence 
trutt who lives in the queens section of new york city is being 
held on 500000 bond on charges of attempted murder possession of 
explosives and manufacturing bombs a second bond hearing is 
scheduled for nov 29 in stamford

the us oil refining industry is booming and a 
new breed of foreign investor will soon be sharing the profits 
but some fear the newcomers will only add more uncertainty to an 
already volatile industry saudi arabia venezuela and china are 
among the latest owners of us oil refining assets 
all are major oil producers two are members of opec with the 
potential to exert power over the american oilpatch 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has been blamed 
for the recent glut of oil on world markets and the resulting drop 
in oil prices that has hurt us exploration and production 
but industry experts attending the annual meeting here of the 
american petroleum institute this past week said us refiners 
welcome their newest partners in business 
the idea of foreign investment is a positive one its money 
coming into the us to buy an existing plant like any other plant 
i dont see any problem with it says john h lichtblau president 
of the petroleum industry research foundation 
jim bailey spokesman for the coastal corp an independent 
refiner that last month signed a joint venture deal with china says 
investment by producing countries will help smooth out extremely 
volatile price and supply swings and assures us of a longterm 
relationship with a crude oil supplier 
but others fear foreign producer ownership of us assets 
jeopardizes national security and further reduces incentives to 
improve domestic production 
just like everything else were selling our assets abroad 
under the guise that supposedly it will be helping shareholders 
said james l van alen an analyst with janney montgomery 
most of the nations major oil companies recently reported huge 
profits in their refining operations thanks to surging consumer 
demand and low crude prices but in a highly cyclical business 
conditions could shift 
economist cyrus h tahmassebi market research director for 
ashland oil inc believes joint ventures with producing countries 
will provide us companies with sound business partners willing 
to take part of the risk in a cyclical business 
but tahmassebi acknowledges there are concerns 
one can argue that joint venture arrangements might lead to 
lower oil prices reduced domestic production and increased 
imports he said in this indirect manner such arrangements may 
have national security implications 
texaco incs recent pact with saudi arabia touched off the 
latest concern about foreign ownership of us oil assets 
under the joint venture the saudis will pay texaco some 812 
million in exchange for halfownership of texaco refining assets in 
23 eastern and gulf coast states and washington dc the saudis will 
supply 75 percent of the initial oil inventory and each partner will 
provide 50 percent of the working capital according to texaco 
analysts agree that texaco invited the saudis in because it 
needed cash texaco expects 18 billion in cash benefits and 
savings from the venture to pay the debt stemming from its 3 
billion settlement with pennzoil co the company said 
but there were other reasons as well 
tahmassebi says the saudi deal ensures texaco secure access to 
saudi crude at competitive prices under the deal texaco said it 
has the right to buy up to 600000 barrels a day at market prices 
a citizens group opposed the deal and called on the government to 
halt the sale until the new administration could determine if it is 
in the countrys best interest 
but analysts said the reagan administration welcomed it as a 
source of greater supply security 
lichtblau believes much of the criticism is groundless arguments 
about foreign producer partners disrupting supplies as opec has in 
the past dont make sense he says 
they wouldnt supply their own refinery they would hardly 
target their own refinery 
analysts also say oil imported under the deals is not displacing 
domestic oil and in fact the new influx of funds may go toward 
further exploration and production by us companies 
joint ventures are not new britain and holland have been in the 
united states for decades through british petroleum co and royal 
dutch shell 
the new trend is the opec countries coming here and china 
lichtblau said 
since the 1986 price collapse tahmassebi says practically 
every opec country has seriously considered the idea of buying 
overseas refineries or embarking on some kind of a joint venture 
arrangement 
venezuela is said to be the biggest investor in refineries in 
consuming countries it now owns some 240000 barrels per day of 
us refining capacity including its recent purchase of a 50 
percent interest in citgo petroleum corp 
coastals deal with china involves a 55000 barrel per day 
refinery in hercules calif as well as storage facilities in 
california and oregon 
lichtblau estimates that opec countries and china together now 
own 7 percent of the nations 13 million barrel per day refining 
capacity 
industry sources believe us refining is ripe for further 
investment 
sun oil co is seriously negotiating with nigeria analysts say 
and ashland oil chairman john hall acknowledges that his company 
also is looking for the right deal with a foreign investor

although it has shaken up the securities markets 
many wall street analysts say the renewed decline in the dollar is 
no cause for great alarm 
the dollars slump in foreign exchange which took it thursday to 
the verge of a modern low against the japanese yen intensified 
after the us election early this month 
and it was widely attributed to worries especially among foreign 
investors about what actions the administration of presidentelect 
george bush would take to cut the federal budget deficit 
but many observers say the circumstances dont justify any big 
surge of pessimism 
we believe that the outburst of hysteria about both the budget 
and the dollar are unwarranted said edward yardeni economist at 
prudentialbache securities 
the debate over what action bush might adopt to reduce the budget 
deficit ignores the fact that measures have already been taken in 
that direction yardeni observed 
the grammrudmanhollings act of 1985 is already on the books 
mandating steady reductions in the budget deficit over the next 
several years 
worries have also surfaced that the dollar must go lower if the 
united states is going to show continuing improvement in its trade 
deficit the gap between the imports it consumes and the exports it 
is able to make and sell 
even if that is so maintains john connolly at dean witter 
reynolds inc given the already substantial decline since early 
1985 it may not entail that much movement from the current level 
the specter of a freefall as developed in 1987 should be 
discounted a really sharp drop in the dollar would make us 
industry too competitive 
since we are probably not all that far from an equilibrium 
level it should not be too difficult for the central banks to get 
us to that level without excessive turmoil 
despite such assurance the stock market remained on the 
defensive in the past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
which had fallen 7877 points the week before lost another 462 to 
206241 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 106 to 15018 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market dropped 
616 to 36758 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was down 481 at 28667 
volume on the big board averaged 13608 million shares a day 
against 13862 million in the preceding week 
the federal reserve gave an indication thursday and friday that 
it believed the dollar had fallen far enough the fed and central 
banks of other industrialized countries intervened in the foreign 
exchange markets to support the dollar and the currency steadied 
intervention of this kind has its limits as well as it uses with 
all the massive resources at their disposal many economists argue 
the central banks of the world cannot change longterm trends in the 
marketplace 
for many skeptics to become believers in a dollar recovery the 
dollar would probably have to turn in a steady showing on its own 
for at least a few days without government help 
if the dollar must go lower before that happens some analysts 
argue so be it 
though a falling dollar does threaten to scare off foreign 
investors with their muchneeded capital these analysts say it 
also might well yield some positive results 
it would give yet another boost to our exports asserted 
yardeni the trade deficit would narrow at a faster pace
