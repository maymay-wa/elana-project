the bush administration appealed to a powerless 
government in exile for permission to board a panamanian freighter 
off key west and was readily accommodated leading to the seizure of 
3359 pounds of cocaine the state department explained friday 
can you tell us which government gave the coast guard 
permission noriegas or the panamanian government we recognize in 
exile a reporter asked during the daily state department briefing 
the department of state requested permission from the delvalle 
government through the panamanian embassy and ambassador juan sosa 
in washington and permission was granted spokesman richard 
boucher responded 
the united states recognizes eric arturo delvalle as the 
legitimate president of panama delvalle was ousted from the office 
in february 1988 at the urging of panamas de facto ruler gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
noriega indicted by a grand jury in miami on drug trafficking 
charges also overturned the results of the may 7 election which 
showed an opposition candidate as the winner delvalle was not a 
candidate 
the united states responded to the election fraud by sending in 
american troops to bolster the 10000 or so soldiers already there 
withdrawing the us ambassador and cutting the us embassy staff 
the us coast guard boarded the panamanian freighter thursday 
night and found the hidden sacks of cocaine transportation 
secretary samuel skinner put the street value of the drugs at 1295 
million 
adm paul yost boarded the 162foot captured freighter at key 
west on friday and praised the interception saying what this 
means is that we have begun to coerce the smuggler back out on the 
sea and out of the air 
the customs service said the ships position off the direct 
route to the dominican republic aroused suspicion but an initial 
search of ship failed to turn up anything officials said 
the us state department went to the panamanian embassy in 
washington and we were given approval to go ahead and board the 
ship coast guard lt jeff karonis said in florida 
in panama government authorities said friday they were satisfied 
that the us coast guard had captured a drugrunning vessel but 
were upset that washington had gotten permission from the delvalle 
government 
we are very happy that the americans have made this capture 
said david carrera of the prosecutors office he added we are 
annoyed about the manner that they sought permission 
the united states and panama have had an antidrug agreement 
since 1976 which mandates cooperation from both sides 
in washington a reporter at the state department briefing 
pressed the issue is the united states view that the delvalle 
government in exile has the authority to grant permission for 
interception of a ship is the united states view that the delvalle 
government in exile has the authority to grant permission for any 
sort of military or paramilitary activity such as the use of coast 
guard forces to stop shipping to and from panama 
boucher said if we decide were going to try to board the 
vessel we go to the government and get permission we certainly do 
recognize the delvalle government as the government of panama and 
we recognize therefore that they have the authority to give us 
permission and then we board the vessel

its not exactly all work and no play 
but many who live in the soviet bloc nations of eastern europe say 
they rarely have either the time or money for recreation 
it is hard to have free time in poland said a woman who held 
a child in each hand as she left a market hall in central warsaw 
we have to stand on line and there is nothing in the stores 
romanians often spend up to five hours a day waiting in line for 
food because much of the food produced there is exported 
practically i have no leisure time with work the home the 
kids a warsaw businessman said 
some eastern europeans work as many as three jobs an air traffic 
controller in poland might also work as a nightclub bouncer or a 
university teacher might moonlight as an exterminator 
while stores and markets in hungary are wellstocked with fresh 
produce and meat other consumer items and appliances are in short 
supply hungarians have grown accustomed to working as long as 16 
hours a day to provide needed services 
ibolya kuzsel a hungarian woman with a 12yearold daughter has 
run her husbands workshop since he died last year kuzsel rises at 
530 each morning to do her chores before work her evenings are 
spent on the accounting saturdays she goes to the cemetery 
i have little time for my daughter she said 
president bush will spend four days in poland and hungary the 
first visit to the warsaw pact nations by an american president 
since 1977 
many eastern europeans find inexpensive recreation in television 
or weekend trips to the country and statistics show that alcohol is 
a popular escape despite attempts throughout the bloc to curb its 
use 
hungarians spend an average of one months salary on alcohol each 
year that nation has the highest alcoholrelated cirrhosis 
mortality rate in europe romania is second 
western television especially popular detective series provides 
diversion 
those in czechoslovakia hungary and poland who can afford it can 
buy satellite dishes to pick up western stations soviet television 
provides variety for some residents of romania and bulgaria 
weekend houses or bungalows are popular for residents of 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland but even weekends mean work 
we just harvested 100 kilos 220 pounds of cherries and 400 
kilos 880 pounds of green beans said a young hungarian 
entrepreneur who spends her work week in her tiny toy shop in 
budapest 
she will can the garden produce for the winter 
real vacations are often too costly for most eastern europeans to 
even consider a weeks vacation in a modest setting for a polish 
family of four could cost three times the average monthly salary 
liberalized travel laws are allowing hungarians more access to 
the west with reasonably priced bus tours to turkey or greece 
costing about 210 the state travel agency also offers more 
exclusive trips such as a threeweek vacation to australia for

abortion advocates have staked out new jersey for the first true 
test of their punch at the polls saying theyll hit the hustings 
and slug it out on the airwaves in an allout effort to elect a 
prochoice democrat as governor 
abortion is going to be smack dab in the middle of this 
election said linda bowker state chief of the national 
organization for women with so few political races this year we 
are going to be the target state she said 
this weeks upheaval in abortion law has jarred other 1989 
campaigns particularly the virginia gubernatorial and new york 
mayoral elections but it is in new jersey that the issue has risen 
quickly to the political fore 
new jerseys race like virginias pits an antiabortion 
republican against a prochoice democrat in new york prochoice 
democratic mayor edward i koch is attacking the neutral stand of 
republican rudolph w giuliani 
people who believe in a womans right to abortion ought to 
be fearful of rudy giuliani koch has said a giuliani aide on 
wednesday accused the mayor of fearmongering 
koch began his attacks on the issue months ago but abortion 
gained new prominence as a political issue monday when the us 
supreme court approved of greater abortion restrictions by the 
states 
prochoice groups promptly pledged to fight new antiabortion 
laws and to work for the election of candidates who favor legal 
abortion in every race we will attempt to make the right to 
abortion the major issue declared now president molly yard 
the outcome is uncertain national polls have indicated that few 
voters cast their ballots solely on the issue of abortion and those 
who do split about evenly on both sides of the debate 
however given the courts ruling were dealing with a whole 
different environment said janice ballou polling director for 
the eagleton institute of rutgers university in new brunswick nj 
all those people in the middle are the ones that this change might 
impact 
in new jersey eagleton polling before the ruling found 23 
percent support for more restrictions on abortion and 68 percent 
opposing restrictions moreover many more abortion supporters held 
their views strongly 
that is promising for democratic gubernatorial nominee james 
florio who has pledged to veto any abortion restrictions and it 
may trouble republican james courter who has favored outlawing 
abortion except in most cases 
if we can have a big win for florio that makes a big 
statement said ms bowker and if we can do well in the 
assembly races that makes an even bigger statement 
her plan of attack a hit list of abortion opponents in the state 
assembly a series of prochoice rallies across the state radio 
advertising criticizing courter on the issue and two new telephone 
lines at now state headquarters in trenton 
courter for his part is playing down abortions significance 
with an aide saying wednesday he does not see it as a central issue 
in the november election 
in virginia prochoice advocates say democratic gubernatorial 
nominee l douglas wilders support for legal abortion has been 
equivocal for example he opposes public funding for abortion in 
most cases wilder faces republican j marshall coleman who opposes 
legalized abortion 
it seems to me that if doug wilders going to win he has got to 
be much stronger on the issue of womens reproductive rights said 
ms yard in washington i think hes been scared by it nobody 
wins by being scared 
in new york the issue has been raised mainly by koch against 
giuliani the frontrunner in the polls koch has had the city pay 
for abortions for poor women who have no other source of funds he 
says giuliani who opposes abortion personally cannot be trusted to 
continue the program 
but charles perkins giulianis spokesman said giuliani would 
continue the abortion funding despite his personal beliefs said 
perkins the mayor is spreading disniformation to try to heighten 
the fears of women 
abortion he said is not a mayoral issue

howling wolves havent 
been heard in yellowstone national park for decades but even talk 
about them is enough to rile the ranchers and others surrounding the 
park 
the national park services program to educate students across 
the country about the role of the wolf in the wild has raised fears 
by some that it could lead to the predators return to yellowstones 
22 million acres 
wolves are fascinating animals and when you talk to people 
about them you never get a hohum reaction they always have a 
strong reaction one way or another said joe zarki a ranger in 
yellowstones naturalist division 
they come with quite a bit of emotional baggage we are trying 
to put some information in the hands of teachers and students what 
wolves do what their behavior is and what sort of role they have 
in the ecology he said it is not designed to sell a particular 
point of view it is supposed to give them information so they can 
make up their minds on their own 
sen alan simpson rwyo is among those who see the wolf 
awareness program as a way to drum up support for the wolfs return 
to yellowstone 
there is no other purpose for it but to promote 
reintroduction simpson said there are guys in there who are so 
heated up and so obsessed they cant even see 
turnofthecentury eradication efforts by ranchers drove wolves 
from yellowstone and in recent years there has been a drive to 
return the animals to the park simpson and the rest of the wyoming 
congressional delegation long have opposed the plan which has the 
support of yellowstone officials 
those who want to return the wolves say they would prevent 
biggame herds from growing too large and overgrazing simpson and 
other foes fear the wolves would stray from yellowstone and prey on 
livestock on surrounding ranches 
rep wayne owens dutah has sponsored legislation that would 
force the park service to study how returning the wolves to the park 
would affect the environment the wyoming delegation is trying to 
derail that effort too 
owens brought a 13monthold female wolf to the lawn outside the 
capitol in washington last month to dramatize his campaign 
the wolf awareness program is being financed by donations from 
the natural history association several large corporations and one 
unidentified donor it is meant to mesh with the parks expedition 
yellowstone program that prepares students for visits to the park 
the financing bothers simpson 
forget the wolf aspect he said the issue is it is a bad 
precedent for interest groups to round up the money to do anything 
through the park service 
simpson said the arrangement amounts to federal government 
endorsement of a program that he says unfairly stresses the benefits 
of having wolves in the park without examining the impact of their 
presence as predators 
the program launched at the urging of former national park 
service director william penn mott is designed to teach students 
about the wolf and its habits not to promote their return to 
yellowstone park officials say 
the program teaches elementary and high school students about 
wolves and urges them to mimic the animals through classroom 
activities such as howling which wolves use to communicate 
students also can join in the debate over the plan to return 
wolves to yellowstone by staging a mock public meeting they 
assume the positions of various special interest groups with parts 
in the debate zarki said 
not overlooked by the program is that wolves no longer lope 
through yellowstone 
its not like we hide from the kids the fact the wolves are not 
here he said we try to deal with that and why most kids know 
animals are not as widespread as they used to be and people are in 
many cases responsible for that 
zarki conceded that the program may result in letters in favor of 
wolf reintroduction but stressed it is not designed to do so 
im not suggesting in the activities that they do that he 
said but if you look in the past there are many incidents 
where students focus on wildlife issues and write to legislators and 
action is taken all we are trying to do is help kids learn a little 
bit more about wolves

the business of hong kong has been business not 
politics so when britain agreed to return the crown colony to 
china the residents did not object as long as capitalism was 
protected after china cracked down on the student prodemocracy 
movement much of that changed here is a report from a 
correspondent who was in beijing when the army arrived 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the crackdown on dissent in beijing has 
multiplied fears that this vibrant capitalist enclave may wither 
under the communist chinese rule scheduled to begin in 1997 
hong kong residents watched in horror as chinese soldiers stamped 
out the prodemocracy movement in june and many responded by 
applying for passports and demanding that britain offer them refuge 
its a tragedy we have here said joseph ys cheng a 
political scientist to most of my friends there are only two 
ways out one is to emigrate the other is to keep quiet keep your 
fingers crossed and hope for the best 
britain agreed five years ago to return hong kong to china in 
1997 when the lease on much of the crown colony expires 
in return the chinese said hong kong could keep its capitalist 
system and enjoy a high degree of autonomy for 50 years under a 
policy of one country two systems 
since then the people of hong kong have busied themselves with 
what they have always done best making money the economy achieved 
impressive growth that reached 135 percent in 1987 and brought 
great prosperity to many of the 57 million people 
economic links with china strengthened dramatically legions of 
hong kong entrepreneurs started factories in adjacent guangdong 
province and hundreds of chinese companies set up shop in the 
territory 
such bonds increased the importance of hong kong in chinas 
policy of modernizing and opening itself to the world a process 
widely seen as the best guarantee of the one country two 
systems policy 
then came the night of june 34 in beijing when the army 
attacked and the government acknowledged that hundreds of people 
were killed the assault and mass arrests that followed caused 
hundreds of thousands in hong kong to shed their political apathy 
and take to the streets in protest 
it has shown very clearly that theres no guarantee from china 
they are capable of doing anything said thomas chan a researcher 
at the center of asian studies at the university of hong kong 
many people are leaving the colony and companies are evaluating 
their future said robert broadfoot managing director of a 
businessrisk consulting group 
a surge in the emigration of skilled workers would cause a loss 
of the local investment and personnel needed for the city to grow 
the government estimates 45000 people emigrated in 1988 up from an 
average of 20000 in each of the previous five years 
sharp increases in immigration inquiries and applications were 
reported last month by consulates of such popular destinations as 
canada and australia even smaller countries like jamaica and belize 
found interest growing 
diane harrison personnel manager of a hong kong shipping 
company said three of its 170 employees had resigned to move 
abroad four were planning to leave and 17 had started the 
emigration process 
everybody is worried about the future she said 
people without the money skills or connections to go where they 
choose are asking britain to provide refuge as an insurance 
policy 
officials in the colony say granting the right to live in britain 
is essential to restoring confidence among residents many of whose 
families fled communist china britain has refused 
there is simply no way that the british government could grant 
to several million people the right to come and live in britain 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said on a recent visit to hong 
kong 
he said britain would take all measures possible to safeguard the 
colony and urged the people not to underestimate your ability to 
build that future 
hong kong has seen hard times before howe said youve 
always shown the resilience and the resourcefulness to live through 
such times and emerge from them stronger than ever before 
a recent poll indicated only 6 percent of residents would move to 
britain if given the right and that most people had no intention of 
leaving hong kong chan said the prodemocracy movement had caused 
many to rediscover their chinese identity 
the political awakening in hong kong touched all levels of 
society in addition to huge street demonstrations a television 
personality organized seminars on democracy and activists collected 
volumes of signatures for various protests 
revulsion about the beijing crackdown was widespread from 
newspapers long supported by beijing to taxi drivers who attached 
tiny black flags to their antennas 
britain which some residents say has not done enough for the 
colony appeared likely to speed democratic reform so the people 
would have a greater voice in their future the legislature is 
dominated by government officials and appointed members 
cheng the political scientist has fought a long battle for more 
democracy but now says what guarantee will it offer if beijing 
is ready to crush the students with tanks and machine guns whats 
the point of having a democratic system in hong kong 
others believe continued support in hong kong for chinas 
dissidents might be dangerous 
beijing leaders could perceive a political threat in hong kong 
that outweighs economic benefits broadfoot said if hong kong 
refuses to keep out of chinas political affairs it could be 
extremely damaging 
observers say the fall of the hardline leadership in beijing or 
enacting a bill of rights and redrafting the post1997 constitution 
for hong kong could help the territorys success extend well into 
the 21st century 
but for now cheng said almost everyone is very depressed

nansun shi a tv producer was just too busy for politics 
before the crackdown now she heads a group teaching hong kong 
residents about democracy and human rights 
china is to assume control of hong kong in 1997 under an 
agreement with britain but the heavyhanded suppression of dissent 
has shocked this colony of 57 million and is changing the attitudes 
of its people 
since the chinese army assaulted tiananmen square the night of 
june 34 hundreds of thousands of hong kong residents have put 
aside political apathy and taken to the streets in protest 
more than 650000 signed a petition for democratic reforms and a 
bill of rights and demanding that hong kong residents be given the 
right to live in britain 
callers to radio talk shows have proposed independence for hong 
kong while others say it should buy some islands to accommodate its 
people some residents have started an underground railroad to 
get dissidents out of china 
zhang xuexin a waiter at the good taste restaurant in the happy 
valley district expressed the feelings of many 
im terrified of what will happen when the communists come my 
whole family is neighbors too 
i fled china during the cultural revolution i swam here and 
risked my neck after 1978 and deng xiaoping i had a little hope 
then there was the massacre on tiananmen now i know communists will 
never change 
fear is not confined to chinese residents many of the 100000 
westerners in hong kong also worry 
this is home said diane harrison 44 ive spent half my 
married life here i had one of my sons here this is where i want 
to be but if we dont leave now and it collapses around us after 
1997 we might just be too old 
under the 1984 agreement between britain and china beijing 
promises to keep hong kongs capitalist system intact for 50 years 
after 1997 it also agreed to an unspecified degree of political 
autonomy currently being negotiated 
after the bloodshed in beijing and ensuing mass arrests many 
people in hong kong lost faith that china would keep its word 
thousands want to emigrate but some like ms shi say they are 
willing to stay and fight 
educated in britain as a member of a welloff hong kong family 
she spent her teens wearing bobby socks and reading seventeen 
magazine 
she returned to hong kong in her 20s got a public relations job 
and soon began reporting on high society for television later she 
moved to producing movies and tv shows 
i never was political at all she said i had a sense of 
what was right but that covered all spheres i just didnt think 
about politics thats not what we were taught to do 
when chinas army attacked the students she said i was 
shocked so i couldnt speak possibly because it was such a simple 
issue which is so rare these days its so black and white its so 
clear who was right and who was wrong 
after taking part in demonstrations organizing a concert and 
working on a song for the prodemocracy movement ms shi said it 
seemed to her that people knew well enough what they were protesting 
but not what they were fighting for 
we were shouting democracy freedom human rights but 
nobody knew what that meant she said i figured i had to find 
out 
the result was a series of seminars on the topic by leading hong 
kong academics 
nancy lau a nurse who attended a recent sunday of lectures at 
the hong kong teachers association said the program opened her 
mind 
it made me want to educate myself she said holding a filled 
notebook our system teaches us how to be good workers but not 
good thinkers 
wang qiao a 65yearold taxi driver who fled shanghai in 1954 
said the crackdown in beijing woke people up it taught the young 
people about the communists 
they said the same thing in shanghai in the 1950s you can 
stay capitalist we need your help all that stuff he said 
then they came in and took the factories away and locked up the 
capitalists its going to be the same story here 
tan the pharmacist said his south vietnamese passport will make 
moving more difficult

a haitian exile who ran for president of his 
island nation in 1987 was arrested thursday on charges he operated a 
bogus bank that may have bilked customers out of tens of millions of 
dollars a federal prosecutor said 
clemard joseph charles who was granted asylum in the united 
states nine years ago and three others purported to run the banque 
commerciale dhaiti from a home in queens and a mortgage company 
from a luxury apartment overlooking central park in manhattan 
authorities said neither concern was authorized to operate in the 
state 
us attorney andrew j maloney said the victims of the scheme 
which ran for about two years ranged from drug dealers to 
international financiers 
what makes this operation so unusual was the brazenness the 
chutzpah maloney said they never moved out of a location they 
never left town that makes it a little extraordinary 
investigators will not know how many people and financial 
institutions were cheated and how much money the scams earned until 
records seized by fbi agents during raids thursday are examined 
maloney said 
the bank apparently cheated its customers out of tens of millions 
of dollars said assistant us attorney charles w gerber adding 
we dont really have a handle on it 
in one complex transaction the bank recently issued bogus 
multimilliondollar letters of credit payable to the palestine 
liberation organization and the economic ministries of iraq and 
libya maloney said 
the letters of credit for 2 million each from the plo and the 
two countries were used to finance the campaign of a politician from 
the dominican republic haitis neighbor on the caribbean island of 
hispaniola according to maloney 
according to court papers the scheme began to unravel last 
october when national westminster bank usa attempted to regain 
losses on a 5 million letter of credit issued by banque commercial 
dhaiti 
maloney said he could not yet explain how the phony bankers had 
managed to continue to operate without detection or retaliation 
authorities said charles 66 came to this country in 1980 after 
he was freed from a haitian jail where he spent 10 years for 
opposing former president francois papa doc duvalier charles 
was one of 35 presidential candidates in the violently aborted nov 
29 1987 general elections 
if convicted of bank fraud and other charges charles and the 
others would face at least 10 years in jail heavy fines and 
forfeiture of property purchased with their earnings maloney said 
he identified the other suspects all listed as officials of the 
bank as arthur aye 74 charles son victor 43 and peter hall 
50 all are from new york 
aye was freed on a 100000 secured bond but us magistrate 
carol bagley amon ordered the others held pending a hearing on 
tuesday

attorneys for photographer ansel adams estate 
argued in federal court thursday that publishers of a book of adams 
pictures taken for the federal government during world war ii 
engaged in false advertising 
they sought to ban the sale of a calendar and desk reference book 
based on the same material which is entitled the mural project 
and said the book publishers wrongly used adams name to sell their 
book 
attorney thomas mustin representing the trustees of the adams 
estate said the trustees did not publish the pictures in question 
because they felt the quality was not representative of adams work 
the publishers are in it for the money mustin argued the 
trustees are in it for the reputation of ansel adams my clients 
want to preserve the integrity and quality of the work 
but attorney richard a wallen representing day dream publishing 
inc of santa barbara said the only reason the quality of the 
pictures is not good is because the negatives are unavailable the 
authors of the mural project john armor and peter wright claim 
the negatives are being hidden by the trustees 
the pictures themselves are in the public domain and can be 
purchased from the government for about 10 apiece they were shot 
in 1941 and 1942 when adams was working for the national park 
service photographing park scenes to be blown up for murals in 
public buildings the murals were never made 
interior secretary harold ickes had hired adams for 2222 a day 
plus expenses and the photos became government property 
us district judge william keller said there is no dispute that 
the photos are in the public domain and mustin said the trustees are 
not challenging publication of the book itself 
we are not challenging the book in these proceedings because we 
understand it is already in the stream of commerce he said the 
toothpaste is out of the tube 
but they seek to stop distribution of the calendar and datebook 
and further use of adams name in advertising 
the ad in question described the photos as the finding of an 
unknown body of work by ansel adams and compared it to the 
discovery of an unknown play by william shakespeare an unknown 
symphony by beethoven 
the trustees claimed this was misleading but the judge disagreed 
the fact is that this was and is a commissioned body of work 
and it was not available until the ferreting out by armor and 
wright he said im not inclined to believe from a practical 
standpoint that this is misleading advertising 
the legal arguments on further points of dispute were continued 
until friday afternoon the judge said he would take the matter 
under submission before issuing a ruling

prosecutors are considering possible 
criminal action in the loss of 2 million of federal housing funds 
in alabama that apparently were used to buy luxury items such as a 
mercedes a speedboat jewelry and furs 
department of housing and urban development documents obtained by 
the associated press allege that montgomery real estate broker cy 
walker spent the money over a threeyear period by using a stack of 
blank wire transfer authorization forms 
huds birmingham office without a system to doublecheck on the 
receipt of funds from hud closings thought the 2 million from 63 
sales closings went to its central office account according to 
agency records in fact the money was in a first alabama bank 
account controlled solely by walker according to a hud audit 
housing officials in alabama tightened controls over hud money on 
nov 9 1987 after they discovered the money was missing that same 
day walker closed out the first alabama account withdrawing the 
last 13654 
the fbi has turned its investigative file over to the us 
attorney for possible prosecution us attorney jim wilson said he 
plans to meet with hud officials this month to discuss possible 
criminal cases 
officials with hud and first alabama bank in montgomery declined 
comment on specific allegations in the case however bank official 
dave gordon said it appeared that first alabama has done nothing 
wrong nothing out of the ordinary 
ap interviews and hud records including canceled checks show 
some of the money was spent by walker for the following purchases 
a 50000 mercedes laurens pierce iii spokesman for jack 
ingram motors in montgomery said salesmen recall that walker bought 
a mercedes 560 sl convertible the hud audit listed nearly 180000 
in checks written by walker to car dealers 
an 18870 speedboat from kowaliga marina the office manager at 
the marina said walker bought a stingray the cadillac of 
speedboats she said 
21000 was paid to high school video memories a business 
enterprise in which walker hoped to sell video yearbooks to high 
school pupils across alabama the venture apparently folded 
also he is accused of spending 5246 on jewelry 8255 on 
furs 9571 on travel and 2200 for a saltwater aquarium and 
accessories 
hud is trying to recover the money through administrative 
procedures 
a hud audit covering august 1984 to november 1987 indicated some 
of the money in walkers account also was spent on hudrelated 
expenses such as grasscutting and maintenance on foreclosed homes 
as well as attorneys closing fees 
the wire transfer forms were provided by an apparently unwitting 
bank employee according to documents 
a memo written by robert e lunsford acting manager of the 
birmingham hud office in november 1987 said the forms led the 
office to believe the bank had wired the money properly to the 
agencys central office 
at the time the agency had no procedure in place to check 
whether it had received the money or not 
walker handled sales of huds foreclosed homes in the montgomery 
area while he was an associate broker for ricks linddavis real 
estate inc the firm was sold in 1986 to johnny m portis who 
closed business operations last year his attorney said portis was 
not aware of what walker was doing with the hud money 
walker did not return a phone call made to the recording device 
on his beeper telephone the number listed for his residence phone 
has been disconnected and walker has moved from the apartment listed 
in the current phone book 
montgomery real estate commission records show that he still has 
a valid real estate license but it is listed as inactive status 
because he has not been associated with a real estate firm since 
nov 14 1988

president bush is rejecting soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs latest proposal for reducing nuclear arsenals 
in europe saying he doesnt want to get off track and challenge 
hardwon nato unity 
bush says he will stand by a nato plan which he orchestrated 
that calls for conventional troop reductions first talks with the 
soviets on cutting shortrange nuclear warheads would come later 
under the formula endorsed by the north atlantic treaty organization 
in may 
as he prepared for next weeks trip to europe the president told 
reporters on thursday he was not concerned with the soviet leaders 
popularity in europe declaring were not going to get into the 
international poll business 
meanwhile the washington post reported today that bush has 
decided to propose a 25 percent pay increases for top career 
government employees with as much as a tripling for a small number 
of key specialists he has endorsed a similar raise for federal 
judges 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday night the 
white house expected to announce the presidents decisions today 
although he could not confirm the figures 
bush on thursday issued a fresh challenge to gorbachev to remove 
red army troops from poland bushs initial call made last week in 
an interview with polish reporters was dismissed by gorbachev as 
political propaganda 
its not political its a visceral feeling i have on the 
question bush said 
he conceded gorbachev had voiced a lack of enthusiasm toward 
his troop withdrawal proposal 
but he added hes just taken troops out of hungary and who 
would have said two years ago that would happen we salute that 
i think it would be nice to aspire to that kind of situation where 
he wouldnt feel troops were necessary 
in his meeting with reporters bush also 
said he was happy that former white house aide oliver north 
was not sentenced to prison but declined to comment further on 
norths sentence wednesday to a 150000 fine a threeyear 
suspended sentence two years probation and 1200 hours of 
community service for his role in the irancontra affair 
challenged east germany and other soviet bloc countries to 
follow the lead of poland and hungary in moving toward more 
democracy saying come along with the flow 
said he would press for a broad tactics international effort 
to clean up the environment at next weeks economic summit in paris 
saying efforts should be focused on preventing pollution at the 
outset rather than cleaning it up afterwards 
bush will travel to poland on sunday as he begins a fournation 
visit to europe that also will include stops in hungary in paris 
for the sevennation summit of industrial democracies and in the 
netherlands 
gorbachev in a speech thursday in strasbourg france said the 
kremlin would make unilateral cuts in its nuclear missiles pointed 
toward western europe if the united states would agree to speedy 
talks on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons on both sides in 
europe 
bush administration officials suggested the gorbachev offer was 
designed to test nato unity 
in may bush won allied support for a proposal for reducing both 
nato and warsaw pact conventional forces to 275000 per side west 
germany went along after initially resisting us efforts to deal 
with troop reductions before grappling with the nuclear issue 
i dont want to get off track by reopening the snf shortrange 
nuclear forces issue when we have a good package that has wide 
support bush said 
the president said he has no plans to go one up with 
gorbachev when he visits eastern europe or to try to establish a 
popularity level in poland or hungary thats not what sound foreign 
policy is about 
i am delighted that he enjoys popularity in europe i am 
delighted when he goes to germany i am pleased when he goes to 
france it is good for world peace when he takes those trips and i 
expect he will be delighted when i go to poland and when i go to 
hungary for we will be well received in those countries 
later thursday bush told a white house symposium on eastern 
europe he will urge us allies to join in an aid package for the 
polish and hungarian economies however he indicated us resources 
are limited and that the two nations must primarily help themselves 
by reforming their own economies

as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was 
heralding improved eastwest relations in bonn recently east 
germany was exhorting its young people to defend socialism with 
weapons if necessary 
east germanys aging leadership is growing increasingly uneasy 
over the momentum of reforms in other warsaw pact countries and 
over the warming of relations between the soviet union and west 
germany 
east germanys leaders arent having a very good time right 
now said heinz timmermann a foreign affairs expert at colognes 
institute for eastern european and international studies 
everywhere they look there are changes going on that threaten 
them timmermann said referring to political and economic reforms 
in the soviet union poland and hungary 
east germanys state media gave scant attention to gorbachevs 
june visit to west germany where he was enthusiastically received 
by citizens 
better relations between bonn and moscow mean more headaches for 
east berlin which has suffered for years from an identity crisis in 
the shadow of its prosperous western neighbor 
gorbachevs popularity in east germany also has posed increasing 
problems as public dissatisfaction mounts over the lack of reforms 
in the nation 
many east germans look to gorbachev in the hope that he can help 
bring change to their rigidly controlled society 
but east berlin once the kremlins staunchest ideological ally 
has begun a campaign to reinforce its orthodox communist views and 
has vehemently attacked advocates of change at home and abroad 
while gorbachev was being feted in bonn and beijing margot 
honecker east germanys education minister and the wife of the 
party erich honecker urged the nations youth to be prepared to 
fight for socialism 
this is a time of struggle mrs honecker told delegates 
attending an education congress in east berlin the times need a 
generation of young people who are willing to struggle to defend 
socialism with weapons in their hands if necessary 
east german leaders promptly defended chinas june 34 crackdown 
on the prodemocracy movement saying violence was necessary to stop 
a counterrevolutionary overthrow of peoples power in china 
security forces beat and detained demonstrators who tried to 
deliver petitions to the chinese embassy in east berlin to protest 
the crackdown 
in a rare public attack against a fellow warsaw pact nation east 
german officials denounced political and economic reforms in hungary 
joachim herrmann a member of the communist partys policymaking 
central committee said the developments in hungary fill us with 
great concern 
under the flag of renewing socialism forces are at work that 
strive for the removal of socialism herrmann said 
hungarys communist party and opposition groups have agreed to 
hold multiparty elections by next summer and the country has 
embarked on bold economic reforms including more cooperation with 
the west 
east berlin is equally troubled by political developments in 
poland state media have largely ignored solidaritys stunning 
victories last month over communist candidates 
the ruling politburo also has stepped up its campaign against 
wouldbe reformers in the east german partys ranks 
in one of the sharpest official rebukes in a decade the 
politburo denounced dresdens party leadership as ineffective in 
controlling hostile bourgeois activities 
dresdens party chief hans modrow is considered sympathetic to 
gorbachevs program of economic reforms and glasnost 
there also are signs the east german government fears that public 
dissatisfaction over the lack of changes in its society could lead 
to violent street protests 
west berlins morgenpost newspaper reported on june 30 that east 
germany had nearly doubled the strength of its elite riot control 
force 
travel restrictions long in force for visits to the west also 
are being imposed for trips to poland and hungary 
west german news reports have said hungary is increasingly 
reluctant to extradite east germans if they flee to austria the 
hungarians have begun dismantling some border barriers with austria 
making it easier for east germans to flee to the west than over the 
heavily fortified border between east germany and west germany

encouraging negotiations with palestinian arabs 
but even before prime minister yitzhak shamir bowed to pressure 
on his right and set tough conditions for elections on the west bank 
and in gaza the outlook for success was not bright 
the palestine liberation organization whose implicit support is 
essential had denounced the plan as a ploy to block a palestinian 
state 
other arabs were less than enthusiastic as well and while the 
bush administration supports shamirs approach it does so only on 
practical grounds 
after decades of frustration the idea is to get israelis and 
arabs to talk about the future of the territories on the theory that 
negotiations develop their own momentum leading sometimes to 
startling results 
under president jimmy carters persistent mediation for 
instance israeli prime minister menachem begin agreed at camp david 
in 1978 to give up all of sinai its airfields and his countrys 
only oil resources in exchange for peace with egypt 
begin like shamir had the reputation of being a hardliner but 
for the sake of peace with the largest arab country begin gave up 
all the land and forced israeli settlers to abandon their homes and 
towns in the desert 
the state department may have had this history in mind when it 
tried thursday to smooth over the conditions shamir agreed to a day 
earlier in tel aviv at the nudging of ariel sharon and other likud 
hardliners 
seeking to draw a distinction between a political partys 
declaration and a government position spokesman richard boucher 
emphasized that the election plan was approved in may by the israeli 
cabinet 
he said the united states was dealing with the israeli 
government and not with a political party whose partisan 
declarations do not advance the peace process particularly if 
they appear to be more restrictive or impose conditions 
the us spokesman urged palestinians to participate in the 
election after fleshing out the details with the israelis 
but in tunis where the plo has its headquarters a spokesman 
said shamirs terms slammed the door on the peace process these 
efforts now face total failure ahmed abdulrahman said 
the elections would produce palestinian leaders to negotiate five 
years of local selfrule for the 14 million arabs who live on the 
west bank and in gaza at the conclusion of this trial period 
israel egypt jordan and the palestinians would work out an overall 
settlement 
theoretically all options would be open 
but shamir has again ruled out a palestinian state a position 
not incidentally the united states also takes 
he also ruled out yielding territory or stopping jews from 
settling in the areas moreover the elections would be held only 
after violence ceased 
the plo response was to threaten an escalation of the attacks on 
israeli forces that have claimed 546 arab lives since december 
this is the only answer to intransigence abdulrahman said 
even so the state department is banking on palestinians 
accepting the election plan partly out of a desire to gain 
international acclaim a move that would be especially dramatic in 
light of shamirs hardline conditions 
that would require a turnabout by the plo 
six months of semirecognition by the united states have not 
produced such concessions from yasser arafats organization having 
declared his acceptance of israels right to exist and repudiating 
terrorism the chairman evidently concluded that was as far as he 
was prepared to go 
where does this leave the bush administration 
apparently in the same tough spot its predecessors occupied 
trying to find a formula for negotiations in the face of stiff 
resistance in the middle east 
and yet carters experience at camp david and the 
egyptianisraeli peace treaty are evidence that long odds can be 
overcome

thanks to entrepreneur robert egger residents 
of two womens shelters in a shabby washington neighborhood will sit 
down tonight to feast on salmon tenderloin of beef leeks japanese 
mushrooms and new potatoes with new york cheesecake for dessert 
nothing is too rich or exotic for the homeless says egger 
who runs a nonprofit food service for washingtons street people 
salmon is a big hit people love smoked fish and roast beef fresh 
strawberries are a bigticket item their eyes really light up when 
they get strawberries 
egger is founder and executive director of dc central kitchen 
a twoman operation that collects unwanted leftover food from 
hotels restaurants and catering firms every day and delivers it 
within 24 hours to homeless shelters soup kitchens and churches 
around the city 
were the federal express of washington food says egger 
since his refrigeratorequipped van began plying the streets last 
january egger estimates he and his partner alex tait have picked 
up 15 tons of unwanted food worth about 60000 and provided 
roughly 10000 free meals to the poor elderly and the homeless of 
the capital 
the salmon and roast beef leftovers that egger picked up from a 
catered dinner party wednesday night for 400 guests at the national 
building museum are standard gourmet fare on the washington party 
circuit but they are rarely found in the garbage cans that many 
street people rummage through in search of a meal 
egger has gotten calls to pick up bags of coconut pots of 
scallop creole pans of mexican beans and rice bowls of pasta and 
octopus salad he gets 20 to 40 leftover pizzas three times a week 
from one restaurant chain when an ice cream store closed its doors 
near dupont circle it gave him 48 fivegallon tubs of its frozen 
confections 
nobody knows how many of the homeless are wandering the streets 
of washington but estimates range from 5000 to 15000 people 
egger says his operation serves about 30 feeding programs around the 
city with generous support from churches foundations corporations 
and charities 
his lengthy list of food donors also includes corporate employee 
cafeterias congressional offices on capitol hill various 
smithsonian museums and galleries the national academy of sciences 
a french bakery where he gets dayold croissants and scores of 
trade associations and lobbying groups that frequently wine and dine 
their clients 
every gift of giveaway food is rewarded with a taxdeduction 
receipt 
egger 31 has been working in washington restaurants nightclubs 
and bars since he was graduated from high school 
he and his wife claudia volunteered reluctantly at first 
for a church parish project in collaboration with other georgetown 
churches to cook and deliver meals to people sleeping on steam 
grates in downtown washington 
most people think their actions dont matter egger said 
but i realized that with a little bit of effort you can make a 
difference in peoples lives it didnt hurt in fact i really 
enjoyed it 
after a while egger concluded it was a waste of money to feed 
the homeless when so much food is being thrown away he began 
soliciting local food establishments for their leftovers 
then it dawned on me he said why bother just to pick up 
and deliver food when theres this golden opportunity to train 
people while were feeding people who are waiting in line we could 
train them so they can step out of the line 
egger is busy renovating an abandoned neighborhood cafe in a row 
house shared with a womens shelter it will be the permanent home 
for dc central kitchen 
egger plans by august to open the kitchen where homeless 
trainees can learn professional food preparation and use their 
experience to land jobs in local hotels and restaurants 
egger dreams of owning a nightclub someday until then he finds 
nothing quite as rewarding as feeding the homeless 
its like being santa claus every day you take free food to the 
people he said

harold prince director of broadways the 
phantom of the opera directed the new production of don 
giovanni which opened the new york city operas season 
after the spectacle of phantom the don giovanni is 
surprisingly conventional 
the problem is devising a set for 13 scenes changing from yard to 
meadow to street to ballroom to cemetery 
prince did it with pedestals that moved in and out a footbridge 
added in one scene and a balcony in a couple of them 
vocally thursday evening at the new york state theater showed 
the company at its best conductor sergiu comissiona and the 
orchestra made the music sound fresh 
at the beginning of the opera before giovanni stabs the 
commendatore the commendatores statue is already on one of the 
pedestals after giovannis seduction of donna anna he climbs down 
a ladder from an upper story while she runs out from the wings 
those two points were disconcerting 
but from then on except for giovanni being unusually passive 
during his champagne aria prince didnt direct with any weird 
conceptions 
this should be a don giovanni that will please enough people 
to last a long time at the new york city opera 
nova thomas made her company debut as donna anna replacing 
elizabeth holleque who was ill 
miss thomas made an astounding impression her voice individual 
and interesting at the same time it is clear and pure her singing 
was lovely throughout conveying the pure soul of this young woman 
who sometimes comes across as banal or matronly 
erie mills made zerlina even younger an adolescent bridetobe 
who isnt a flirt as much as so unexposed to the world that shes 
just dumb miss mills singing however was poised and limpid 
frances ginsberg also conquered as donna elvira probably the 
hardest of the three soprano parts to make work elvira wants 
vengeance against giovanni for leaving her and she wants him back 
john cheek was impressive in the title role in acting he made 
giovanni a man who has chosen to be a womanizer and pursues the 
ladies with enthusiasm but no unnecessary fuss 
his voice is commanding though sometimes he mushed the words 
together 
cheek has been singing at the metropolitan opera mostly in 
supporting parts a status which surely will be upgraded at once 
jan opalach sang leporello with effortless vocalism he made 
giovannis servant much younger than his master able to jump over 
walls and vault to the top of pedestals 
dean peterson made masetto a more intelligent bridegroom than 
often is done nikita storojev who has been a principal singer with 
the bolshoi opera made his new york city opera debut he really 
sang the commendatore not just boom out a hollow sound 
jon garrison presented an uptight even precious don ottavio 
but sang the part well with reinedin warmth 
rolf langenfass who created costumes for the mets current ring 
cycle designed the sets and costumes next season hell work with 
prince on a new production of faust at the met

the rev george a stallings hates the sight of 
empty pews and thats one reason he wants the roman catholic church 
to allow a special rite for black americans 
but a black bishop contends that stallings suspended as a priest 
for creating an unauthorized parish in washington could wind up 
with a church that is no different from any other evangelical 
congregation competing for members and dollars 
stallings who is black said in an interview thursday that the 
catholic church is missing the boat in attracting blacks and other 
minorities because its hierarchy and traditions are too bound by 
european culture and dominated by white males 
it fails to evangelize make converts among blacks because it 
doesnt train anyone to do so he said adding that other religions 
are filling the gap 
i have been to cities where the church was closed stallings 
said black protestants came in there and took over and now they 
are packed to the gills 
stallings said he wants to create a separate africanamerican 
catholic rite along the lines of the ethnic eastern rite churches 
those churches accept the authority of the pope but have 
considerable autonomy in ritual and discipline 
the unauthorized service conducted sunday at stallings imani 
temple showed at least one side of what the new rite would entail 
the service combined the traditional catholic mass with african 
ritual and the footstomping handclapping style of the traditional 
black protestant church 
baptists and muslims also attended the service held at howard 
university law school 
stallings was suspended the next day by washington cardinal james 
a hickey and barred from performing the catholic sacraments 
at stake in stallings battle are 2 million black american 
catholics a minority of both blacks some 30 million in america 
and american catholics as a whole 54 million 
according to church figures there are 300 black priests and 13 
black bishops of the 17000 catholic parishes 1200 are 
predominantly black 
stallings said the catholic church must develop an 
africanamerican catholic liberation theology to address social 
and political needs 
it is difficult if not almost impossible for one ethnic or 
cultural group to define or to decide what is good for another 
ethnic group he said it is always necessary for those ethnic 
groups to get a seal of approval from the white male power group 
but catholic officials black and white criticize stallings for 
his methods and what they say are his unfair attacks on the church 
the fathers argument that there is racism in the church has 
been acknowledged said auxiliary bishop john h ricard of 
baltimore who is black certainly we have a long way to go 
rather than defying hickeys authority stallings should work 
with the cardinal to form a new rite ricard said adding that the 
danger is leading a church that is no different from any other 
what father stallings is going to find is that frankly the 
ministers who can perform the preaching styles and rituals in his 
church are a dime a dozen ricard said referring to the host of 
evangelicals crowding the airwaves the catholic priest gets his 
authority from a roman collar 
the rev william lori hickeys secretary also indicated 
stallings needed to work through the catholic hierarchy 
the difficulty is not that he tried those channels and is 
blocked lori said the difficulty is that he has spurned those 
channels 
lori said the church must reject the idea that only blacks can 
preach to blacks and whites to whites 
however john h cartwright an expert in black religion at 
boston university said thats part of the problem 
the church has been colorblind to a fault he said its 
blind to itself you almost need to hold a mirror up to it

the intense rain flooding the east coast from 
washington to new york this week is part of an unyielding weather 
pattern aided by remnants of tropical storm allison meteorologists 
report 
the weather pattern is unusual the meteorologists said but 
resembles patterns that flooded parts of virginia and west virginia 
four years ago and drenched the east coast in 1972 both in the 
wake of damaging storms 
this weeks rain disrupted train service between new york and 
washington swept away a camper in north carolina and created 
generally miserable conditions in the region 
something like this is somewhat unique because its a slow 
moving pattern just kind of stagnating here said david miskus 
of the federal climate analysis center 
intense rain drenched a relatively narrow strip from suburban 
washington to suburban new york on wednesday meteorologists said 
thursday from 2 to 6 inches of rain fell in most areas but 10 
inches or more fell in some spots especially in northern delaware 
its not a frequent occurrence but it happens said storm 
specialist bob case of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla pointing to a similar situation that caused west 
virginias floods in 1985 
case said tropical storm allison isnt directly to blame for the 
stagnant pattern but it has helped keep the east coast under its 
wet blanket 
allison came ashore in texas more than a week ago worked 
northward to western kentucky and drifted to alabama where case 
said it is identified as a low pressure area the air circulates in 
a counterclockwise direction around lows 
at the same time and to the north a high pressure center is 
circulating in the opposite direction over the atlantic ocean 
leaving the high and the low systems grinding against each other 
like two gears said case 
the air flows have pulled warm moist air northward from the gulf 
of mexico said case 
the real culprit is this inundation of tropical unstable 
air he said 
case said hurricane juan in 1985 and tropical storm agnes in 1972 
left similar patterns as mementos after they had gone 
frank richards and scott kroczyksni of the national weather 
services office of hydrology explained that on tuesday night and 
wednesday cold air moved in above the warm tropical air between 
washington and new york 
the cold air which was heavier and more dense sank down 
leading to a sudden overturning of the cold and warm air once it 
started it was almost like a chain reaction said richards 
explaining the deluge 
but miskus said even some of the dramatic rainfall totals 
reported in delaware fail to compare to tropical storm records 
the most rain from one storm in a single day occurred in alvin 
texas in 1979 when 43 inches fell in 24 hours he said 
the latest rain is falling on a region already softened up by 
stagnant weather patterns that persisted in may leading that month 
to be the wettest since 1895 in the southeast and the second wettest 
in the south said miskus

us sugar production is rising after a slump 
because of last years drought according to agriculture department 
forecasters 
total production in the 198990 crop year that begins sept 1 is 
expected to be about 73 million tons up 56 percent from 198889 
output estimated at 691 million tons 
prompted by prices guaranteed under the governments system of 
supports and protective quotas that limit the entry of cheaper 
foreign sugar domestic output climbed to a record 733 million tons 
in 198788 
in 198586 by comparison total us sugar production was barely 
6 million tons 
with improved growing conditions sugar production in the coming 
year could match or exceed the record level of two years ago 
beet sugar production forecast at 39 million tons would be up 
11 percent from the droughtreduced level of 351 million tons this 
season the departments economic research service said thursday 
cane sugar which rose to a record of just under 34 million tons 
in 198889 is forecast at about the same in 198990 
according to field information through midjune beet planting 
and early development have generally gone well throughout the beet 
areas the report said this is in sharp contrast to last year 
when a series of spring weather problems was followed by drought in 
key eastern growing areas 
the report added drought particularly in the nonirrigated 
red river valley of western minnesota and eastern north dakota and 
disease and weather problems in california lowered yields 
these three states accounted for 55 percent of total sugar beet 
harvested acreage in 198889 and 51 percent of the total beet 
tonnage that compared with 56 percent and 54 percent respectively 
during the three previous seasons 
yields would have been even lower had it not been for good 
growing conditions late in the season excellent harvesting weather 
and higher rates of sugar recovered from the beets the report said 
farmers are expected to have about 13 million acres of beets for 
harvest in 198990 about the same as this season 
the area for sugar cane harvest is expected to be about 807000 
acres up 10 percent from 198889 reflecting small increases in 
florida louisiana and texas mainland production is forecast at 
about 245 million tons and hawaiis output 940000 tons 
hawaiis sugar cane acreage continues to contract with only 
77000 acres likely to be harvested this season compared with 
almost 100000 in the early 1980s the report said alternative 
land use continues to encroach on traditional sugar acreage

hong kong has turned into a growing market for 
us duck feet and tongues says the agriculture department 
deepfried duck feet in oyster sauce and duck tongues soaked in 
fish sauce or stirfried with seasonal vegetables are some of the 
dishes offered by chinese restaurants in hong kong the departments 
foreign agricultural service said 
the demand for whole ducklings feet tongues and gizzards is so 
brisk that the local supply cant keep up 
as a result the agency said in the july issue of agexporter 
magazine a number of us poultry plants have built a thriving 
export business on supplying the hong kong duck market 
jim hoben an executive with one processing plant concord farms 
of concord nc said us duck processors sold more than 4 million 
pounds of duck feet to hong kong alone last year 
all of our duck feet and tongues are exported to hong kong 
hoben said that market represents 4 percent of our total business 
and it is a very important market for concord farms 
aggressive market promotion in hong kong has been part of the 
reason for us success in the duck market the usdas targeted 
export assistance program which helps finance approved overseas 
promotional efforts has been particularly effective 
for example the program financed a booklet featuring recipes for 
duck feet tongue and duckling recipes for the hong kong market 
available there in both chinese and english the report said

marines guarding the us embassies 
abroad are often limited in offduty activities but now theres 
something for their minds college by mail 
the marine security guard battalion reached an agreement recently 
with penn state university to offer an associatedegree program to 
the 1450 marines guarding 141 embassies and consulates around the 
world 
taking classes by mail will help relieve boredom in such hardship 
posts as the embassy in ouagadougou the capital of the west african 
nation of burkina faso marine capt david vindich said 
theres absolutely nothing there said vindich the 
battalions education officer 
also marines stationed at embassies and consulates in the soviet 
union are restricted by a nonfraternization policy while those in 
beirut cant leave the compound because of the countrys civil war 
a lot of these places are really isolated vindich said 
were providing an educational opportunity and were also giving 
them something to do 
vindich said marines in the elite allvolunteer battalion 
generally spend 15 months in a hardship post and then 15 months at a 
less rigorous embassy or consulate 
more than 400 marines serving in embassies and consulates already 
take courses but their efforts toward degrees have been largely 
unstructured he said 
they were out there spinning their wheels you talk college 
credits and semester hours and that kind of thing it boggles the 
mind of a 19yearold kid just out of high school 10000 miles from 
home vindich said in a telephone interview from quantico va 
under an agreement reached in may penn state will offer liberal 
arts degrees in letters arts and sciences the university has 
planned course concentrations for the marines including business 
security and justice political analysis and foreign policy and 
language and culture 
vindich said he expects 400 would sign up this year 
an associate degree would cost about 4800 or 5000 said peter 
forster coordinator of special programs at penn states department 
of independent learning vindich said the marine corps pays 75 
percent of tuition costs 
penn state has the largest universitybased correspondence course 
program in the united states offering 225 courses to 22000

federal safety officials want the coast guard 
to be allowed to regulate luxury cruise ships that are owned by 
americans carry americans and use american ports but fly under 
foreign flags 
were not in a position to protect the lives of an american 
citizen in these types of vessels and somethings got to be done 
about it said jim burnett a member of the national 
transportation safety board 
the ntsb on thursday issued several recommendations that would 
affect more than 80 cruise ships that dock at us ports 
only two or three such cruise ships are registered in the united 
states board investigators said 
the board which is preparing a more extensive report on the 
cruise ship industry in a few months recently concluded an 
investigation into a fire that caused a nearcatastrophe aboard a 
bahamianflagged vessel off the florida coast 16 months ago 
the board concluded that a lack of maintenance lack of 
firefighting procedures and poor crew training caused the fire 
aboard the scandinavian star which was carrying 700 people back to 
st petersburg fla from a twoday gulf of mexico cruise 
the board said failure of a firefighting system and the 
inability of crew members who spoke a variety of languages to 
communicate with each other and with passengers contributed to the 
emergency 
it was only sheer luck that no injuries or deaths occurred 
aboard the 10000ton vessel owned by sea escape of miami said ntsb 
chairman james l kolstad 
this is an invitation to disaster said kolstad he said 
usowned cruise ships are registered in several different 
countries because of the high expenses involved in meeting 
requirements as us flag carriers 
jill dechello spokeswoman for sea escape said the company had 
no immediate comment on the board decision she said the company 
operates four 10000ton ships each carrying 950 to 1100 
passengers on cruises out of miami 
in the last decade the board has investigated five major fires 
aboard cruise vessels three of them on sea escape ships one in 
1984 killed one passenger and one crew member scores of people have 
been injured mostly from smoke inhalation 
no other deaths have been reported in accidents aboard 
americanoperated cruise ships but a cuban ship captain and two 
sailors were killed when the usowned celebration cut their 
freighter in half feb 10 
the board is seeking court orders to force witnesses to give 
testimony in its investigation of the celebration accident the 
ships owner carnival cruise ship lines has refused to cooperate 
in the safety investigation saying it is responding only to 
authorities in liberia where the vessel is registered 
in thursdays action the board asked the coast guard which 
regulates civilian shipping to seek legislation that would give it 
authority over the safety of cruise ships 
the board also called for smoke detectors that automatically shut 
down ventilation systems so smoke wont spread through passenger 
cabins improved testing of fire extinguishing systems backup 
generators for fire alarms public address systems and smoke 
detectors and several other safety improvements for all cruise 
ships the safety board has no authority to impose its 
recommendations 
the board said the scandinavian star fire on march 15 1988 
started with an oil leak it said fuel pipe packing seals and 
deflector sleeves that would have prevented the oil from being 
ignited were deteriorated and had not been replaced 
im afraid this ship was being managed more like a night club 
than a vessel said board member burnett who led the 
investigation into the fire 
the ship which was towed to miami after the fire was put out 
has since been repaired and is back in operation

auto industry officials say the jury is out on 
whether a government ban on most remaining uses of cancercausing 
asbestos will translate into higher prices for consumers 
the substitute material and system are relatively more 
expensive i cant quote you a figure toni simonetti a 
spokeswoman for general motors corp said thursday shortly after 
the government announcement 
but many companies including general motors have been 
substituting other materials for asbestos in products such as brake 
pads and linings for several years consumers therefore have 
already paid the price for the change 
we have known that we should be eliminating asbestos from 
various parts of our products said fred bowditch vice president 
for technical affairs at the motor vehicle manufacturers association 
of the united states 
the industry official also said he did not believe the switch to 
substitute material would be considerably more expensive 
in the face of widespread criticism the environmental protection 
agency ordered a ban on asbestos used in a range of items from 
automobile brake parts to roof shingles the prohibition is to be 
phased in over the next seven years 
the ban will reduce the number of asbestosrelated cancer deaths 
by at least 200 the epa said 
the ban however does not affect existing asbestoscontaining 
products epa officials expressed concerns that replacing the 
hazardous material might be more dangerous than a phaseout 
the agency first listed asbestos a natural product that has a 
strength 10 times of steel but can be woven like cotton as a 
hazardous air pollutant in 1972 and urged it to be banned in 1979 
the first question i had was why has this thing been around so 
long said epa administrator william reilly in announcing the ban 
critics have charged that the reagan administration prevented 
earlier epa action on asbestos 
nevertheless use of the material has declined significantly in 
1987 85000 metric tons of asbestos was used for a wide array of 
products down from the 240000 metric tons used in 1984 
asbestos has been linked with various forms of cancer including 
lung cancer 
auto makers have been phasing out asbestos for use in brake pads 
and linings and many said thursday that the epa decision came as no 
surprise 
a companywide program to remove asbestos from our disc brake 
pads drum brake linings and other components began in the early 
1980s since that time considerable progress has been made said 
victor h sussman an official at the ford motor co 
ford is aiming for a total phaseout of asbestos in its north 
american passenger cars by 1993 for 1994 models 
general motors meanwhile produces front disc brakes that are 
almost all asbestosfree however 75 percent of the companys cars 
and half of its small trucks have rear drum brakes with asbestos 
pads and liners 
under the ban the use of asbestos in some products including 
roofing material pipe wrap and sheet products will be prohibited 
next year use in brake pads and linings will be banned in 1993 and 
its use in auto replacement parts cement water distribution pipes 
roof shingles and a variety of other products will end in 1996 
the agency estimates that the cost to consumers for the phaseout 
will be about 460 million over the next 13 years 
among the substitute products are kevlar a synthetic fabric used 
with resin and some types of metallic fiber industry officials 
said one manufacturer who requested anonymity said he prefers the 
substitute 
most of us would rather sell metallic pads anyway they cost 
more he said 
the ban does not cover guided missile liners acetylene cylinders 
and some sealing tapes the epa said it was difficult to find 
adequate substitutes and the hazards involved were minimal

robert b fiske jr says he withdrew from 
consideration for the no 2 job at the justice department to avoid a 
lengthy confirmation battle threatened by conservative republican 
senators 
the withdrawal marked a setback for attorney general dick 
thornburgh who had lobbied conservatives on behalf of his choice 
for deputy attorney general 
fiskes letter to thornburgh taking his name out of consideration 
was released thursday by the justice department 
last month 14 mostly conservative republican senators objecting 
to fiskes role as chairman of the american bar associations 
standing committee on federal judiciary from 1984 to 1987 urged 
president bush not to nominate him for the justice department post 
in his letter fiske wrote while i have no doubt that my 
nomination would have won the overwhelming support of the members of 
the united states senate there could have been a long delay in 
final action 
knowing of your need to fill this important position as quickly 
as possible i reluctantly concluded that it would be best for me to 
step aside at this time 
fiske reached by telephone declined to comment saying only 
that he would continue his private legal practice in new york 
a pillar of the new york legal establishment fiske served as 
us attorney in manhattan during the ford administration 
but conservatives criticized him for his role in screening 
president ronald reagans judicial nominees for the american bar 
association 
sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking gop member on the senate 
judiciary committee had urged fiske to withdraw to avoid a lengthy 
divisive confirmation fight in the senate thurmond warned fiske 
that some opponents might wage filibusters to stall his confirmation 
opponents accused him of torpedoing reagans nominations by 
forwarding the names of prospective nominees to liberal 
organizations giving the groups an advance opportunity to organize 
opposition 
fiske acknowledged that names were sent to these organizations as 
part of a longstanding aba practice of determining if potential 
nominees had shown a history of bias against minorities and women 
the conservatives also accused fiske of using ideological 
criteria to rate the professional qualifications of reagans 
nominees 
in his reply to fiske thornburgh expressed great regret at 
the decision and said conservatives had misstated and 
misunderstood his record as chairman of the aba screening panel 
i am glad to have been part of the effort to set the record 
straight which now has been done thornburgh said

the united states will cancel debt 
potentially billions of dollars owed the us by subsaharan 
african countries 
the announcement thursday by president bush marks a reversal for 
the united states which has preferred only to stretch out repayment 
terms for debtor nations 
beginning oct 1 the us government will forgive official 
development loans in the subsaharan countries the president told 
a news conference 
in 1987 the most recent year in which figures were immediately 
available the state department put the total of us loans to 
subsaharan africa at 43 billion including 743 million in 
development loans 15 billion from the us governments 
exportimport bank and 12 billion in us government loans to buy 
surplus american farm products 
bush did not say which of these categories would be included 
africa south of the sahara desert is usually taken to mean all of 
africa except south africa and the north african countries on the 
mediterranean egypt libya tunisia algeria and morocco 
bush said his action would be in accordance with a decision made 
last year in toronto at an economic summit of industrialized 
democracies to offer different options to creditor governments 
other governments notably west germany france the netherlands 
and the nordic countries have converted many loans into grants 
loans have become the preferred form of us aid but as third world 
debt has mounted and the burden of interest payments on debtor 
countries increased the pendulum has swung back to grants 
in 1987 subsaharan africa owed 1378 billion in medium and 
longterm debt it was estimated that payments due from these 
countries had risen from 56 billion in 1979 to 21 billion a year 
for the period 1986 to 1989 
total third world debt is put at about 13 trillion

president hussain mohammad ershad who 
took power in a bloodless coup in 1982 has proposed a 
constitutional amendment limiting the presidency to 10 years 
the proposed amendment was presented to parliament thursday 
where it is assured of passage because ershads jatiya party holds 
251 of the 300 seats 
i am certain that they the legislators are going to pass it 
so it is good from my side and i am certain it is good for our 
country the 59yearold former army general said 
ershad resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later was 
elected to a fiveyear presidential term in national balloting that 
political opponents and foreign observers said was tainted by 
widespread vote fraud 
under the proposed amendment ershad can seek reelection in 1991 
to another 5year term but he would be banned from seeking a third 
term 
bangladesh has had nine presidents since it won independence from 
pakistan in 1971 each took office through military intervention 
either through coup and assassination or through installation of 
civilians who heeded the armys dictates 
ershad who has governed bangladesh longer than any other leader 
said the decision to limit the term of the president was part of his 
effort to modernize the nation 
we have to prove to the world that bangladesh is something more 
than a poor country ershad said 
bangladesh whose 110 million people have an average annual 
income of only 160 is perennially buffeted by floods cyclones 
tornadoes and drought

years 
hes doing very well said dr allan lansing who performed 
the surgery thursday hes had no problems or complications so 
far 
brown 55 was listed in critical condition in the intensive care 
unit of humana hospitalaudubon late thursday night hospital 
officials said it was routine for patients to be listed in critical 
condition after that kind of operation 
dr david dageforde a cardiologist also caring for brown said 
the former governor had suffered a minor heart attack late last 
friday dageforde said subsequent tests showed damage to his heart

surgery lansing said brown should be released from the hospital 
within a week to 10 days

occurred after brown underwent a triplebypass operation in june 
1983 when he was nearing the end of his fouryear term as governor

industrial nations should join banks in 
writing off up to 50 percent of the third world debt former 
secretary of state henry kissinger said 
realistically banks alone cannot bear the burden of what 
creditors have to do he said thursday 
kissinger who came to this country on wednesday for a threeday 
visit at the invitation of president carlos andres perez denied 
reports he would be paid by venezuela to help it renegotiate the 
terms of its 33 billion foreign debt 
perezs efforts to impose austerity measures in this country 
backed by international creditors prompted riots in february that 
killed about 300 people 
similar problems in may in argentina which has the thirdlargest 
foreign debt in the developing world caused food riots and led to 
the deaths of 14 people 
kissinger called for reducing third world debt by up to 50 
percent depending on the performance of the debtor country 
latin america led by brazil mexico and argentina owes foreign 
creditors 401 billion 
kissinger singled out mexico and venezuela as examples of debtor 
countries that have carried out economic reform policies on their 
own and are therefore deserving of our support 
asked about the crackdown in china last month against the 
studentled reform movement kissinger said the harsh suppression 
occurred because economic reforms moved more rapidly than 
political reforms 
however he appealed for caution in western policy toward china 
a billion chinese are the single most important factor in asia 
the western world should be very careful not to drive them back 
into isolation or hostility on an emotional basis he said

communist officials dealt a parting blow 
to longtime hungarian leader janos kadar hours after his death by 
saying political changes had passed him by 
kadar who died thursday at age 77 came to power as soviet 
troops crushed the 1956 antistalinist uprising he oversaw early 
stirrings of economic and political reform but lost power last year 
to enthusiasts of quicker change 
in remembering his life the party leadership in a statement 
carried thursday by state media said kadar had led the way to 
national consensus and always aimed at a humanist socialism 
however it said that time and the communist hungarian 
socialist workers party have surpassed the life work of kadar the 
politician in the spirit of his heritage demanding justice we must 
declare this painful fact 
in the 1960s kadar gained a degree of popularity at home and 
abroad with cautious economic reform and relative political 
tolerance 
however in the late 1970s he backed away from reforms and the 
countrys economy went into a slow tailspin 
plans for his funeral were not announced the four members of the 
partys ruling presidium were named to a special committee to 
organize the funeral the committee was to be headed by party 
chairman rezso nyers 
however nyers and other government figures left for bucharest 
romania on thursday for a warsaw pact summit that is to include 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev there was speculation kadars 
funeral would be delayed until after next weeks visit to hungary by

about a month after bernard bravermans lover of 
20 years died of aids he found an eviction notice on the door of 
the rentcontrolled greenwich village apartment they had shared for 
15 years 
on thursday after the states highest court ruled that a partner 
in a longterm homosexual relationship can take over their apartment 
when the leaseholder dies braverman said 
it means i won a major burden is off my shoulders now 
the case considered by the court of appeals involved another man 
in the same situation and the ruling may affect thousands of 
homosexual men and women and their lovers their life partners 
or spousal equivalents in the legal lingo that has developed 
i think its an historic event said arthur s leonard a 
professor at new york law school and chairman of the city bar 
associations committee on law and sex its the first time im 
aware of that the new york court of appeals has recognized that a 
gay male couple may constitute a family and obviously a lesbian 
couple as well 
thats pretty exciting pretty revolutionary 
lawyers are uncertain but the ruling may also affect unmarried 
heterosexual partners older people who live together to save money 
and poor families who cant afford legal fees to adopt children or 
obtain a divorce 
the most immediate effect of the ruling was on new york citys 
homosexual community which is being ravaged by aids 
its courageous i think said everett quinton 37 who 
shared an apartment with playwright charles ludlam for 12 years 
before ludlams death in 1986 there was a bit of sympathy of 
humanity but then it was sorry to hear about it but youve gotta 
get out now 
its been happening all over im glad this ruling came down 
people can bury their dead and not immediately have to worry about 
where theyll stay 
quintons apartment however was rentstabilized not 
rentcontrolled and mondays ruling while encouraging doesnt 
extend to his situation 
rentcontrol and rentstabilization laws limit the rent increases 
landlords can charge for some apartments the rentcontrol laws 
apply to longterm tenants in apartments built before 1947 
the court expanded the definition of a family as it applies to 
new yorks rentcontrol laws which say only family members may 
take over rentcontrolled apartments when the tenant of record dies 
the court said a longterm emotional and financial commitment 
makes a couple married in the laws eyes 
protection against eviction doesnt rest on legal documents or 
blood relation judge vito titone wrote but instead should find 
its foundation in the reality of family life 
it is the totality of the relationship as evidenced by the 
dedication caring and selfsacrifice of the parties which should 
in the final analysis control titone said 
in a dissenting opinion judge richard simons said the court was 
too broadly interpreting the state legislatures intent in drafting 
new yorks rent control law the courts 42 decision he said 
produces an unworkable test that is subject to abuse 
for 54yearold braverman who has aids the ruling appears to 
remove the specter of eviction more court hearings will decide that 
i thought dealing with aids was enough of a battle for anyone 
but this extra thing taking away my home my support system my 
roots in the community that was an awful thing hanging over my 
head said braverman 
now that this has come down the lower courts will move i 
hope more aggressively to protect people in these circumstances 
said david hansell director of legal services for the gay mens 
health crisis 
also on thursday a law was scheduled to take effect in san 
francisco permitting unmarried couples to register as domestic 
partners giving them certain rights such as the right to 
bereavement leave from a city job if the partner dies 
but its implementation was suspended pending certification of 
signatures on a petition seeking to put the measure on the november 
ballot and repeal it

about 60 million americans 20 and older more 
than onethird of the nations adults face the risk of coronary 
disease because they have high blood cholesterol levels a study has 
found 
whats especially disconcerting is that high cholesterol levels 
are often seen in association with other risk factors 
hypertension smoking or being overweight says christopher 
sempos one of eight authors of the study published in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
and for many people most of the desired changes could be 
achieved through a change in routines like diet and exercise 
sempos a nutritionist and epidemiologist with the national center 
for health statistics in hyattsville md said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
even though weve made great strides in alerting the public to 
the dangers of cholesterol and heart disease theres still too 
large a segment that is putting itself unnecessarily at risk 
the federal center lists coronary disease as the nations leading 
killer claiming 521000 lives in 1986 the last full year for which 
statistics are available 
in the study researchers examined data from 11864 adults 20 to 
74 years old who participated in the second national health and 
nutrition examination survey from 1976 to 1980 
the average blood cholesterol level for an american adult woman 
was 215 milligrams per deciliter for men it was 211 
cholesterol is a steroidlike compound that is produced both by 
the body and contained in fats that make up part of the diet it is 
circulated in the blood and is important for normal functioning of 
the cells 
but too much cholesterol can cause deposits to build up on the 
arterial walls restricting the flow of blood to the heart muscle 
and contributing substantially to heart disease 
fruits vegetables whole grains and beans are known to lower 
cholesterol and nutritionists say lean meat fish and poultry in 
small portions are acceptable for a healthy diet 
foods cited as high in cholesterol include fatty meats such as 
spare ribs and highly marbled steak ice cream and most other dairy 
products egg yolks pies cakes and cookies 
for the studys purposes participants with a blood cholesterol 
level of 240 or higher were considered to be in need of medical 
advice and intervention to lower it 
the same was true for any participant whose cholesterol level was 
200 or higher if they had at least two other risk factors for 
coronary heart disease high blood pressure diabetes previous 
heart disease or stroke excess weight or smoking 10 cigarettes or 
more daily 
those two groups constituted 36 percent of the participants in 
the survey a percentage researchers used to arrive at the 
estimated 60 million american adults 
researchers found a substantial increase with age in the 
proportion of people who are candidates for medical advice and 
intervention for those 20 to 39 the rate was 20 percent for those 
40 to 59 almost 50 percent and for those 60 to 74 almost 60 
percent 
one doctor found some reason for optimism in the studys findings 
because the average cholesterol levels have been on the decline 
weve gone from a cholesterol level of 240 for a middleaged 
man during the 1950s to around 215 today said dr jeremiah 
stamler a professor of cardiology at northwestern university 
medical school we can do even better 
the american people have listened and maybe now theyll listen 
a little more closely 
the national heart association estimates that the direct and 
indirect costs to the public related to coronary heart disease 
including physician and hospital fees and loss of productivity 
because of worker absences will total 388 billion in 1989

a new york dealer today paid nearly 1 million for 
a medieval enamel plaque that lay forgotten in a drawer for decades 
sothebys auction house said 
in another transaction christies house said an 18th century 
mahogany chest of drawers sold thursday for 18 million the 
highest price ever paid for a piece of english furniture 
sothebys said new york dealer edward lubin paid 926000 for the 
plaque which illustrates the biblical story of cain and abel lubin 
said he was buying the plaque for an institution which he did not 
identify 
the name of seller who lives in carshalton near london was not 
given 
the seller told auctioneers that the 4inch square plaque made 
of copper and enameled in several colors was left to her by her 
parents she said she forgot about it for 30 years until she 
recently found it in a sideboard drawer art historians have 
identified 11 similar plaques in museums in london paris and new 
york but they dispute their origin 
some think they came from an altar made for henry of blois 
bishop of winchester and brother of king stephen of england he 
reigned from 1135 to 1154 
however at least one expert thinks the plaques came from a cross 
made for abbot suger at st denis in france 
lubin also paid 516000 for three english enamel panels from a 
12th century casket that depict biblical scenes 
the seller was not identified 
neither the seller nor buyer of the mahogany chest were 
identified by william hanham a spokesman for christies 
the george iii dressing and writing commode was built about 1760 
for william beckford a lord mayor of london the spokesman said 
the chest was one of a pair built by john channon a devonshire 
cabinetmaker the other piece is on display in londons victoria and 
albert museum 
hanham said he believed the price was influenced by the auction 
sale of an american desk by nicholas brown in new york last month 
at 121 million the sale set the record for a piece of furniture

a texas lawmaker wearing flag stickers and softsoled shoes ended 
a 12hour filibuster against a flagburning resolution early today 
as around the nation the issue sparked protests and political 
battles 
new york gov mario cuomo introduced legislation that he said 
would outlaw flag burning without a constitutional amendment while 
two people in florida were arrested in separate flag destructions 
and an arkansas judge was asked to block a flag burning 
the unfurling of flag issues comes two weeks after the us 
supreme court overturned a mans conviction in texas ruling that 
burning the flag as a protest was protected by the constitutions 
freedom of speech guarantee 
in austin texas state sen craig washington sought to block a 
resolution that asks members of congress to support a constitutional 
amendment making flag burning not a protected right of the first 
amendment 
he began his stalling tactics at 125 pm thursday and ended it 
at 140 am cdt today 
i was prepared to go the rest of the night washington said 
i dont think i could have gone much longer than noon 
it was unclear whether senate leaders would bring up the 
resolution later today 
washington who opposes flag burning said the issue is 
protection of the first amendment and nothing else 
the constitution has earned the right to be saluted he said 
washington also said the resolution had no purpose 
it is utterly without substance it is nothing more than a 
symbolic occasion for us to tell our constituencies and the world 
how we feel about this issue he said 
the effects of the hours of talking seemed to get to washington 
at one point he rubbed his head and said im starting to get 
a little stir crazy 
later rep senfronia thompson got on her knees and massaged his 
legs 
railroad commissioner kent hance a likely republican candidate 
for texas governor in 1990 said washington was out of line 
the people of this state dont want the us flag burned and 
craig washington should be able to understand that hance said 
the resolution passed the texas house last week when members 
stood and recited the pledge of allegiance and an early test vote 
in the senate was 232 in support 
elsewhere cuomos legislative proposal would make the simple act 
of burning a flag other than for legal disposal purposes illegal and 
punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to 1000 
cuomo said his bill would not violate the first amendments 
freedom of speech guarantees because it deletes any reference to 
conduct that has a communicative or expressive impact on others 
the new york democrat said the proposal was preferable to 
president bushs call for a constitutional amendment because 
protection for the flag could be provided much faster the governor 
also said tampering with the first amendment would establish a 
dangerous precedent 
in florida 19yearold robert rase of jacksonville was charged 
with grand theft for allegedly stealing a 20footby38foot flag 
outside a complex that houses the fbi and secret service detective 
robert bogers said rase cut up the flag attached the blue field 
with stars to his bedroom ceiling and covered a sofa with the 
stripes 
in gainsville fla art student terry towery 25 was released 
from jail wednesday after his arrest for burning a us flag along 
with paintings and other art objects in a tuesday night theatrical 
performance he said was in honor of free speech 
police said they arrested towery because he violated the citys 
burning ordinance he faces a misdemeanor charge of making a bonfire 
without a permit and within 150 feet of a building 
in another case arkansas secretary of state bill mccuen asked 
pulaski county chancellor judge lee munson to block a flag burning 
scheduled for sunday by robert say mcintosh at the state 
capitol mccuens petition contended that earlier attempts by 
mcintosh to burn a us flag resulted in damage and endangered 
people 
on monday munson declined to block the burning

mikhail s gorbachev and his squabbling 
east bloc allies today opened a warsaw pact summit that is expected 
to bring more arms control initiatives 
the publicityconscious soviet president was tightlipped about 
his expectations for the twoday meeting in the romanian capital 
asked by reporters what he expected gorbachev said only ill 
tell you after we finish 
gorbachev is attending the meeting with soviet premier nikolai 
ryzhkov and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze romanian 
officials said reporters would be allowed no access to them and the 
other soviet bloc leaders during the closeddoor meetings 
gorbachev arrived in bucharest late thursday from strasbourg 
france where he announced that moscow and its allies could agree on 
unilateral cuts in soviet shortrange nuclear missiles in eastern 
europe if nato is prepared to negotiate reductions on those weapons 
this meeting may produce numbers for those cuts 
the western alliance patched up a divisive row between west 
germany and the united states over such negotiations six weeks ago 
president bush on may 29 proposed drastic reductions in conventional 
forces of both military blocs in europe 
speaking thursday at a news conference in washington bush 
spurned gorbachevs call for swift negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
bush noted that nato leaders at the summit in brussels six weeks 
ago agreed to begin negotiations on such weapons only after an 
eastwest agreement had been reached to reduce conventional forces 
and reductions were actually under way 
i dont want to get off the track by reopening the shortrange 
nuclear forces package he said 
west germany was pushing for quick talks on shortrange nuclear 
weapons but agreed to delay them until after preliminary agreements 
are reached on conventional arms reductions at eastwest talks in 
vienna 
bonn signaled however it hopes agreement will come within the 
year deadline proposed by bush other western nations call that 
optimistic 
gorbachev said in bonn last month that the warsaw pact summit 
could deliver a detailed response to bushs proposals to reduce the 
armed forces of east and west in europe to 275000 on each side and 
agree on further cuts in weaponry and combat aircraft 
romanian officials said the pact will not announce a decision 
until after the summit ends saturday 
romanias tightly controlled state media announced no firm agenda 
for the meeting 
the state news agency agerpres announced only that eastern 
european delegations arrived to a welcome from president nicolae 
ceausescu the east blocs most resolute foe of gorbachevs moves 
toward more democracy and marketoriented economies 
just last week in a speech pointedly distributed to foreign 
journalists covering the summit ceausescu rejected any return to 
private ownership and insisted we must take a firm attitude 
against any attempts to denigrate socialism 
we think that the concern with a better development of 
socialism in various countries should not bring a negation or 
underrating of the might of socialism he added in a clear swipe 
at recent developments in hungary poland and the soviet union 
political reforms in those countries have divided the once 
monolithic east bloc with romania most staunchly opposed to change 
and east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia also still dominated 
by orthodox communists 
a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
meeting was expected to be held on ideology saturday after the pact 
summit formally ends 
very little is expected to come out of it he said alluding 
to the deep divisions within the soviet bloc 
ideological quarrels have exacerbated traditional nationalism and 
centuriesold rivalries between the diverse ethnic groups of eastern 
europe 
neighboring hungary and romania are engaged in the fiercest feud 
a war of words resulting from romanias alleged mistreatment of its 
17 millionmember ethnic hungarian minority 
hungary has also antagonized neighboring czechoslovakia with 
political reforms and a decision to halt work on a joint danube 
river dam project 
bulgaria is isolated from its pact allies over its treatment of 
its turkish minority who are leaving the country by the tens of 
thousands following the death of at least eight turks in violent 
protests against a bulgarian assimilation campaign

former gov evan mecham is challenging his 
impeachment last yeer by the arizona senate in a petition with the 
state supreme court 
in the petition which was filed thursday he asks for more than 
570000 in expenses and demands the impeachment be quashed or that 
he be given a new trial by the senate 
we cant let it stand because not so much the effect on me 
but if thats the case then no governor in america is sitting 
safe said mecham who is campaigning for governor in 1990 
companion petitions filed by supporters claimed that they were 
deprived of a constitutional right to lobby lawmakers to keep mecham 
in office when chief justice frank gordon jr sitting as head of 
the senate court of impeachment said it would be illegal to try to 
influence the impeachment vote 
mecham a republican was ousted by the gopcontrolled senate on 
april 4 1988 on charges he obstructed justice and misused a state 
protocol fund 
speaking with reporters after thursdays court filings mecham 
and his lawyer donald macpherson said they would rather have 
mecham reinstated outright but would settle for a new trial and for 
proceedings on whether some senators were biased 
macpherson said the impeachment was flawed because senators never 
took a separate vote on each element of the potential offenses and 
because of confusion over the state of the law 
the lawyer said the house bill of impeachment described mecham as 
doing some things in the course of his official duties when he 
actually had done them before his election 
macpherson also accused mechams impeachment trial lawyers fred 
craft and jerris leonard of ineffective representation saying they 
had not raised key issues such as the separate votes 
mecham who had praised craft and leonard in the past declined 
to comment on that portion of the petition 
craft and leonard said they understood why mechams new lawyer 
would raise the issue but recalled that mecham also had criticized 
all the other lawyers involved in the impeachment craft said mecham 
had called him for legal advice as recently as june 29 
the senate earlier this year rejected mechams call for a new 
trial and legislative leaders said thursday they would turn over 
the new challenge to their lawyers 
mechams lawyers had to wait until now to file the petition 
because the arizona constitution does not allow lawmakers to be sued 
while they are in session the legislatures 1989 regular session 
ended last month 
mechams ouster elevated elected secretary of state rose mofford 
a democrat to the governorship mrs moffords press secretary 
vada manager declined to comment on the petitions 
were not going to speculate that far in the future he said

us and japanese leaders are urged in a new 
report to stress to their people that both sides have more to gain 
through cooperation than ruthless rivalry 
but unless the united states can come to terms with its fear of 
being taken by the japanese and the japanese abandon their 
mercantilist view of the world such cooperation remains beyond 
reach says the report published by the johns hopkins university 
school of advanced international studies 
leaders of both japan and the united states need to foster 
greater public understanding of the real issues especially on 
defense said the 68page study issued this week entitled the 
united states and japan in 1989 
three previous reports in the annual series dealt in detail with 
individual economic disputes between the two countries the latest 
study focused more on managing the relationship to prevent conflicts 
from overshadowing basic advantages 
political leaders in washington and tokyo should take the lead 
in working to eliminate misconceptions and reaffirm the basic 
premises of usjapan cooperation lest misunderstanding lead to 
bad legislation the report said 
although fundamentals supporting the usjapan relationship 
are almost universally positive these can be quickly forgotten in 
bouts of namecalling it cautioned 
the report voiced concern over the rapid growth of a cottage 
industry of japanbashers in washington who warn us that japan 
represents a greater threat than the soviet union to our economic 
and security interests their various allegations if left 
unanswered can erode the relationship leading to the 
selffulfilling prophecy syndrome 
tracing what it called real issues the study said 
japanese political leaders will have to make unprecedented efforts 
to present japans defense responsibilities in a straightforward 
manner and stress the importance of the us military bases to 
japan 
us government officials must educate the american public 
on japanese contributions to us defense and make clear that 
the united states is in japan for its own national security not 
simply to defend japan 
the study said both countries should correct domestic problems 
creating usjapanese friction

scientists have found the aids virus in blood 
plasma supplies that had slipped through standard blood screening 
procedures according to a study released today 
the discovery means that plasma tainted with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv could infect recipients of 
transfusions said dr jean pierre allain an author of a study 
published today in the journal of the american medical association 
allain of abbott laboratories in north chicago and fellow 
researchers have developed an hivantigen test that they say can cut 
the detection time in half which can help minimize the number of 
hivinfected blood plasma from leaking into commercial supplies 
the scientists studied 35000 blood plasma samples collected over 
two years at two plasma collection centers and found seven to be 
hivinfected allain called the number fairly high 
but experts with the american red cross said that although the 
threat of a transfusion recipient being infected by hivcontaminated 
blood plasma is real the risk is small 
of the 2236 transfusionassociated cases of aids reported by 
the centers for disease control in april 1989 only two cases 
resulted from transfusions given since the implementation of hiv1 
antibody screening in early 1985 roger y dodd and lewellys f 
barker of the american red cross said in an accompanying editorial 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the current licensed test cannot detect the aids virus until the 
bodys immune system has produced antibodies to fight the virus 
usually at four weeks after infection allain said 
the new test developed by abbott laboratories searches for 
viral particles known as antigens which appear about two weeks 
after infection 
at this stage the hiv is highly infectious higher than at any 
other stage allain said 
beyond that point the immune system produces antibodies that 
repress reproduction of the hiv virus allain said 
the test currently is awaiting approval by the food and drug 
administration 
the researchers said they knew of no deaths caused by 
hivcontaminated blood plasma that had slipped through the screening 
process

secretary of state james a 
baker iii today criticized israels likud party for imposing new 
restrictions on the holding of palestinian elections in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
baker said the likud action was not helpful but he noted the 
step was taken by a political party and was not a government action 
speaking to reporters at the conclusion of a meeting of key 
southeast asian nations baker said the united states will continue 
to support the israeli governments proposals for palestinian 
elections in the occupied territories 
among other restrictions the likud resolution said there can be 
no such elections so long as the 19month palestinian intefadah 
or uprising persists 
the elections would be for palestinians to choose leaders for the 
purpose of opening settlement talks with israeli authorities 
baker spoke to reporters after attending a meeting of the 
sixnation southeast asian nations and other interested parties he 
is to fly later today to the arabian peninsula nation of oman 
additionally baker said he and his asean colleagues agreed on 
the importance of maintaining open lines with china while 
denouncing the horrible actions of the chinese in cracking down 
on prodemocracy demonstrators a month ago baker said there was 
agreement that outsiders must encourage chinas full return to the 
international community 
the principal topic of discussion was how next to deal with the 
situation in cambodia once vietnam completes its scheduled troop 
withdrawal by the end of september 
baker said that he had received assurances from soviet officials 
of their willingness to establish an international peacekeeping 
force to guard against the outbreak of war in that country once the 
vietnamese are gone 
baker said it would be his preference that the khmer rouge who 
ruled with a heavy hand from 19751978 not be represented in any 
provisional government that may form after hanois forces withdraw 
he acknowledged too that he is in disagreeement with former 
cambodia head of state price norodom sihanouk on this issue 
sihanouk has said that it is better to have moderate elements of 
the khmer rouge in government than to have the rebel movement to 
continue its armed struggle in the field 
in earlier remarks to his asean colleagues baker said there is a 
critical need for asean and western unity to insure the emergence 
and survival of a new independent cambodia 
this new cambodia must be free to determine its own future and 
it must not be dominated by the murderous khmer rouge he said 
he called for a comprehensive solution encompassing a ceasefire 
measures to control the khmer rouge effectively transitional 
powersharing arrangements and free elections

officials of amnesty international said today they 
are worried about the fate of sudanese leaders who were toppled in a 
military coup last week 
the londonbased human rights group said it was seeking 
assurances that all those detained are not being illtreated and 
that they are being allowed prompt access to legal counsel 
relatives and independent medical examiners 
it also said in its statement that if the detainees were not 
being charged with a crime they should be released without delay 
the sudanese army said late thursday that soldiers surrounded the 
hideout of ousted prime minister sadek elmahdi and captured him 
when he tried to escape 
elmahdi who led a civilian government went into hiding after 
the coup soon afterward the junta arrested about 45 senior 
politicians and members of the ousted regime 
amnesty international also recalled that before the coup it had 
expressed concern about killings and torture committed by government 
forces and civilian militias in the southern sudan 
rebels in that region have been fighting the government for more 
autonomy

exxon co usa said it will make employees 
available for questioning in the state investigation of how some 
copies of company records on the exxon valdez oil spill were 
destroyed 
company officials said thursday that the destroyed records were 
backup computer files and that all primary records and documents 
on the spill remained on other computer tapes in company possession 
i can assure you of exxons continued cooperation in assisting 
your office to fully understand the circumstances and insignificance 
of the computer backuptape matter exxon lawyer ed ackerman 
wrote alaska attorney general douglas baily 
baily demanded wednesday that exxon allow the state to take 
depositions from employees involved in the records destruction 
which exxon says was an accident he termed it potentially a loss 
of devastating proportions 
david ramseur a spokesman for gov steve cowper said exxon had 
agreed to supply affidavits next week from employees who handled the 
records baily said he hoped to get the depositions under way within 
two weeks 
les rogers an exxon spokesman in houston said the affidavits 
are part of an internal company report on the tape incident which 
will be provided to the state 
the oil company is under state and federal court orders to 
preserve its records of the march 24 tanker spill in which nearly 11 
million gallons of alaska crude oil fouled prince william sound 
while the state has not yet filed any spillrelated lawsuits 
against exxon it plans to by the end of summer baily said 
baily said he became aware of the records destruction when he was 
contacted by a new york times reporter who had interviewed the main 
exxon employee involved kenneth a davis 
davis told the newspaper that he had inadvertently destroyed the 
files and feared he was being made a scapegoat to cover his 
superiors negligence in protecting company records davis was fired 
june 8 the day after the damage was discovered the times reported 
the destroyed material included internal memos and 
wordprocessing documents from exxon shipping co which owns the 
exxon valdez and exxon usa the newspaper said 
exxons ackerman said the records were lost when the computer 
tapes were inadvertently written over with other information 
the tapes normally are kept for a time to restore the computer 
system should its primary tapes be damaged 
these backup tapes normally would be recycled every few weeks 
and are not intended to serve as a permanent archive of exxon 
documents he said 
in san diego meanwhile the coast guard said it will provide the 
exxon valdez with a protective escort tuesday when the damaged 
tanker arrives at the the national steel and shipbuilding co 
shipyard for repairs 
seven coast guard and harbor police boats will maintain a 300to 
500yard safety zone around the tanker as it travels through the san 
diego bay to keep boatborne gawkers and protesters from impeding 
the vessel coast guard cmdr jack scarborough said thursday

the security council passed a resolution 
saying it deeply regrets israels continued expulsions of 
palestinians from the occupied lands 
with the united states abstaining the 15nation council on 
thursday voted 140 for the resolution that cites the deportations 
last month of eight palestinians 
this proves once again the irrelevance of the whole 
institution ambassador johanan bein of israel said after the 
meeting on the day of a major terrorist attack in which 14 
people are dead and 27 wounded the security council finds fit to 
deal with expulsions 
he was referring to an attack in which a palestinian shouting 
god is great seized the steering wheel of an israeli bus on the 
highway outside jerusalem and caused it to veer into a ravine where 
it exploded in flames 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said the united states 
opposes expulsions but abstained from voting on the resolution 
because it did not take into account the violence and security 
problems facing israel 
israel has expelled about 55 palestinians since the palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule of the gaza strip and west bank began 
19 months ago 
the united states israels staunch ally frequently votes in 
favor of israel by not exercising its veto power as one of five 
permanent members of the security council the united states 
delivered a rare but mild chastizing of israel 
the resolution was adopted after days of negotiations in which 
the united states succeeded in changing its language from 
deplores to deeply regrets 
in the absence of incitement and violence expulsions would not 
be necessary bein said should quiet be restored the 
possibility of allowing the return of the expelled persons will be 
considered 
since the uprising began 550 palestinians and 23 israelis have 
been killed 
bein said the expelled were involved in activities ranging from 
throwing fire bombs and hand grenades to planting bombs possessing 
arms blocking roads and imposing a reign of terror on the local 
population 
expulsions therefore were the only means left to curtail 
these activities he said 
the resolution sponsored by syria and the arab league demands 
that israel ensure the immediate return to the territories of 
deported palestinians and stop deportations 
it cites the geneva convention of 1949 which covers treatment of 
civilians in time of war and prohibits expulsions israel says the 
convention permits limited deportations under special conditions 
and that its expulsions qualify 
current members of the council are algeria brazil canada 
colombia ethiopia finland nepal malaysia senegal yugoslavia 
and the five permanent members the united states soviet union

president bush was nearing a final decision on 
a proposal that would give most senior federal officials pay 
increases of 25 percent matching a salary hike he has already 
advocated for federal judges white house officials said today 
but while the announcement was expected by days end bush still 
had not signed off on details of the proposals said one official 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
its still on his desk the official said 
both the washington post and the washington times reported that 
bush would formally ask congress today for the pay raise for top 
officials and would couple it with a proposed ban on congressional 
honoraria 
sources said the proposal now on bushs desk does not contain a 
specific pay raise proopsal for congress to go along with the 
proposed limit on outside income 
bush has advocated pay raises in general for congress but has 
decided to steer clear of becoming ensnared in what is always a 
poltically treacherous issue on capitol hill deciding instead to 
let congress resolve the matter itself the sources said 
an announcement on the pay issue seemed likely today as the 
president sought to clear away unfinished business before embarking 
sunday on a nineday trip to europe that will include the 
sevennation economic summit in paris 
the washington post said bushs pay package would include 
increases of as much as 200 percent for a small number of 
critically skilled federal workers 
however sources said the increase for most other senior federal 
officials would be an acrosstheboard 25 percent 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on thursday night said the 
white house expects to announce the presidents decisions today 
g jerry shaw counsel to the senior executives association said 
he had heard the presidents proposal would be for 25 percent but 
had not received definitive word on that point 
we strongly support the raise shaw said 
the association however has opposed larger increases for key 
specialists such as physicians the government is having trouble 
recruiting and training 
the 7200 members of the governments senior executive service 
and 800 top presidentially appointed executives currently make 
68700 to 80700 their pay is tied to the 89500 that members of 
congress get and the rejection of the congressional pay increase in 
february meant no raise for them or for judges 
a private commission headed by former federal reserve board 
chairman paul volker recommended a 25 percent increase immediately 
followed by a similar amount in 1991 applying to judges executive 
branch officials members of congress and others such as top 
military officers 
the newspaper said bush had decided not to change his previously 
announced proposals for congress to decide its own pay increase and 
for a ban on honoraria the fees members of congress get for making 
speeches

the louisiana house has asked district 
attorneys to enforce a criminal law that was on the books before the 
landmark 1973 us supreme court decision giving women the right to 
have abortions 
the resolution which does not have the force of law was 
approved 8113 thursday night it now goes to the senate which will 
give speedy passage said rep woody jenkins 
this will allow the court to face squarely the issue of whether 
to uphold or overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision said 
jenkins who serves as floor leader for issues pressed by 
fundamentalist churches 
jenkins said mondays supreme court ruling in which it upheld 
missouris right to regulate abortion invited states to test the 
roe vs wade ruling missouri like louisiana prohibits the use of 
public funds employees or facilities for abortions 
a check with the louisiana state university law center showed 
that louisianas preroe statutes were never ruled unconstitutional 
said jenkins 
the chief law said jenkins prohibits anyone from performing an 
abortion and carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison 
we were enjoined by the federal courts from enforcing it 
because of roe vs wade he said our resolution will have the 
effect of sending the district attorneys to federal district court 
asking that the injunction be lifted 
opponents said jenkins wanted louisiana to flout the supreme 
court 
we are saying with this resolution that we are going to go 
above the court said rep kip holden this is not just to 
provoke a ruling from the court this is asking district attorneys 
to throw doctors in jail 
rep alphonse jackson said the monday ruling did not disturb a 
womans right to have an abortion in the first trimester women 
have that right he said 
the louisiana legislature is in special session to ratify the 
extension of a state sales tax jackson noted that gov buddy roemer 
did not include abortion legislation in his official call for the 
sixday session legislators cannot draft laws on topics not covered 
in the official call 
however house speaker jimmy dimos said the resolution was not a 
law this urges district attorneys to act we can offer urge and 
request resolutions in this session 
jenkins said he believes the district attorneys will cooperate in 
a state that has such strong antiabortion sentiment

china intensified its assault on washington today 
saying the united states has repeatedly violated the human rights of 
its own people and therefore has no right to criticize chinas 
handling of demonstrators 
during the process of quelling the recent counterrevolutionary 
rebellion the american government and congress under the pretext of 
protecting human rights meddled with chinas domestic affairs 
said the peoples daily the official publication of the communist 
party 
when the chinese government on june 4 used firm methods to 
quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion the us government became 
furious and was the first to impose sanctions on china to exert 
pressure on us the newspaper said in a commentary 
but everybody can still remember us sen joe mccarthys 
notorious anticommunist antichina legislation the paper said 
and 100 years after the declaration of the emancipation of 
americas slaves the discrimination faced by blacks and people of 
other colors is still serious 
washington suspended military sales and highlevel governmental 
exchanges after the chinese armys bloody suppression of protesters 
seeking democratic reforms china says 200 to 300 people died 
western sources and chinese witnesses say up to 3000 people were 
killed 
in addition to the sanctions the chinese government has been 
angered by us protection of dissident fang lizhi who with his 
wife li shuxian took shelter at the american embassy shortly after 
the crackdown 
noting us criticism of south africa and its involvement in 
korea vietnam and grenada the paper said washington has never 
stopped its interference with other countries internal affairs 
this is the reality of the american guardians of human rights 
in a separate piece titled how america tramples on human 
rights the communist party mouthpiece printed a chronology of 
civil rights and antiwar protests in the united states complete 
with numbers of arrests and deaths of demonstrators 
in another story the peoples daily said student leaders passed 
on state secrets to foreign journalists and received foreign 
passports so they could escape from china 
the autonomous student union through the help of foreign 
powers even obtained passports for some 40 of their members so 
they could flee the country in the event things turned for the 
worse newspaper said 
it did not name any countries that provided passports but said 
considerable financial support came from the united states and 
france and said people from hong kong operated from rooms at the 
beijing hotel near the square to distribute money to students 
the student leaders maintained illicit relations with 
traitorous organizations overseas and themselves were traitors and 
collaborators it said 
the peoples daily also repeated charges that students received 
money from overseas saying when the student leader masterminds 
finally went underground each had tens of thousands of yuan 
thousands of dollars 
major chinese papers also gave prominent play to a lengthy speech 
by beijings conservative mayor chen xitong attacking a wide range 
of intellectuals for contributing to the political environment that 
fostered the democracy movement 
chens speech to the national peoples congress a week ago but 
only released thursday took up three full newspaper pages and 
lashed out at a number of writers editors and dissidents whose 
airing of political positions prepared for the turmoil that 
ensued 
the spreading purge of intellectuals included news reports of the 
ousting of a deputy editorinchief of the huayue publishing house 
in rural shaanxi province and the burning of a book the firm 
published the story of a chinese who never lies because it 
allegedly embraces bourgeois liberalism or western liberal ideas 
he also leveled further charges at former communist party chief 
zhao ziyang who was sacked last month for his prostudent views he 
was replaced by shanghai party chief and political hardliner jiang 
zemin 
the evening news showed writers and artists saying zhao neglected 
political education and blamed him for what they said was a 
proliferation of lowquality artistic works including pornography 
for many years there was no serious and complete 
implementation of the policies of the central committee before we 
didnt know what happened now its clear the reason was comrade 
zhao ziyang said zhang jiong a researcher at the chinese academy 
of social sciences

a battle by musicians to block taped music in 
resort showrooms got a boost when several stars led by sammy davis 
jr rallied for live entertainment 
we cant have this town which was built on live entertainment 
live music go the other way said davis dont let them do this 
thing to us 
the entertainers show of support came thursday for members of the 
musicians union local 369 who are locked in a dispute with five 
major resorts 
davis jerry lewis robert goulet tony orlando and shecky greene 
turned out at a press conference called by the musicians to 
publicize a fight musicians say will cost them dozens of their jobs 
i dont want to see my friends the musicians go the way of 
dinosaurs goulet said for all of our sakes lets bend a 
little and come to a mutual understanding 
some of the entertainers however professed little knowledge of 
the details of the dispute and some contradicted the unions 
staunch position against eliminating jobs in production shows 
shows that feature an ensemble rather than a visiting headliner 
i think that might be a concession the musicians can make 
lewis said referring to the idea of using taped music at the 
production shows but dont bring it into the celebrity rooms 
where the sinatras and the others perform 
the union is fighting a july 26 deadline three resorts have set 
to eliminate musicians in production shows the resorts and two 
others have also proposed hiring musicians playing for showroom 
singers only for the time they actually work instead of guaranteeing 
them a certain number of paid weeks a year 
how do you throw 45 lives away union president mark tully 
massagli said of those employed fulltime in production shows 
weve learned to live with some taping in town but for an entire 
production show to be put to a recording is not fair to the 
musicians or the public 
musicians went on strike last month against the tropicana hotel 
when talks stalled on the resorts plan to use tape in its folies 
bergere show and have warned of strikes against the flamingo 
hilton caesars palace ballys and the las vegas hilton

the last of five cloistered roman 
catholic nuns has left her monastery after spending nine months 
barricaded in the infirmary to protest liberal changes 
sister teresita who with four others locked herself in the room 
on oct 4 left the carmelite monastery thursday leaving no word on 
her destination said tim manning a spokesman for the diocese of 
paterson 
she indicated to another sister that she was going to a safe 
place and would be in touch with mother theresa hewitt the 
monasterys prioress manning said 
last friday three other nuns ended their selfimposed exile 
leaving only sister teresita in the infirmary the three left with 
an akron ny priest according to laywoman betty sutton a 
spokeswoman for the rebellious nuns 
neither ms sutton nor manning knew if sister teresita was to 
join the other three nuns or how to reach them they said 
the five nuns began their protest quietly last october at the 
monastery about 25 miles from new york city but soon found 
themselves in a bitter struggle with paterson bishop frank rodimer 
and their prioress 
reached by the associated press in march sister john of the 
cross one of the five said the group objected to reforms 
instituted by the newly appointed prioress they included such 
things as candy television and popular music that she said 
detracted from the prayerful atmosphere intended by the founders of 
the carmelite order 
the five held out through threatened evictions by rodimer hoping 
their appeal to the vatican would overrule the bishops order to

the food and drug administration said today it 
is banning the sale of nonprescription creams and lotions whose 
manufacturers claim they grow hair or prevent baldness because none 
has proven effective 
the fda said in todays federal register that no manufacturer has 
been able to show that such a product works 
the ban applies to products available without a prescription that 
are used externally these products are usually sold by mail or 
through barbers or beauticians 
the ban will become effective in six months the fda said 
the fda also said there is no evidence that vitamins food 
supplements or other products taken orally retard baldness or grow 
hair the agency said it will remove these products from the market 
on a casebycase basis if their distributors continue to make such 
claims 
the only product approved by the fda for stimulating hair growth 
on the crown of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2 percent 
solution of minoxidil which is applied externally the drug is 
manufactured by the upjohn co and sold under the name rogaine 
the fdas ban is based on a recommendation of an advisory panel 
that evaluated a number of ingredients including lanolin olive 
oil wheat germ oil and vitamins the panel found none of these 
prevented baldness or promoted hair growth 
the fda said that once the ban is in effect manufacturers of any 
nonprescription drug claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair will 
have to provide proof to the agency that it is safe and effective 
before it can be put on the market

white residents are complaining about 
their lack of representation on the board of aldermen so town 
leaders have asked their lawyer to study creation of a 
whitemajority district 
im in favor of this mayor james washington who is black 
said after hearing a petition read from white residents they 
comprise about 15 percent of the 1400 residents of the mississippi 
river town 
the petition asked aldermen to create four wards including one 
with a 65 percent white votingage population and a fifth atlarge 
slot on the council 
over the past 10 years federal lawsuits have forced more than 30 
mississippi cities to change the way they elect city government 
officials to allow for greater black representation however friars 
point is the first municipality to consider greater white 
representation 
we dont deserve to have three places or even two on the 
board said john yount who presented the petition wednesday we 
just want to be involved in whats going on and have a voice to 
represent our interests 
friars point had at least one white member on the board until new 
municipal officials took office monday and the council became all 
black 
currently all members of friars points board of aldermen are 
elected atlarge meaning all voters cast ballots for each member 
the petition claimed that atlarge system discriminated against 
white residents and violated the oneperson onevote principle 
board members voted unanimously to have the town attorney study 
the feasibility of drawing up districts and report the findings at 
an aldermen meeting july 13 
the majority of the board were in favor of going to the ward 
system an expert should be employed to study population 
demographics and ward lines said the attorney hunter twiford 
if the council does vote to change it would require federal 
court and justice department approval under the voting rights act of 
1965 
yount said he was pleased with the petitions reception he said 
the aldermens cooperation would save the taxpayers money 
we dont want a lawsuit he said if we went to court and 
won the town would have to pay attorneys fees we dont want that 
we just want someone to represent us

several bottles of cheap wine 
tainted with a soapy solution or broken glass have been found 
recently in areas frequented by transients but no one has been 
injured police said 
the tamperings might have been attempts to harm the homeless but 
if so they were clumsy ones police said officers noted that the 
bottle seals had obviously been broken and the caps simply screwed 
back on the bottles were full 
no one under any circumstances would want to have anything to 
do with bottles like that sgt richard glaus said we made an 
assumption and we think its a big assumption that there might be 
an intent to do harm 
the first three bottles were reported by a woman on may 27 at 
vera cruz park an area often frequented by homeless people in this 
seaside community 90 miles northwest of los angeles 
the three bottles of boones farm strawberry hill contained a 
soapy liquid glaus said the liquid has not been tested 
last saturday three more tainted bottles containing small bits 
of broken glass were found near railroad tracks and near a pathway 
to a beach often used by homeless people glaus said 
police also had a report from a man who said he found some wine 
that looked tainted june 27 but had thrown the bottles away

natos supreme commander in europe gen john 
galvin said today the warsaw pacts superiority in conventional 
weapons is much more of a threat than its superiority in shortrange 
nuclear arms 
galvin also said that jumping into negotiations on reducing 
shortrange nuclear forces could make it tougher to bring the warsaw 
pact to the bargaining table to discuss conventional weapons 
if we get into the shorterrange nuclear forces too early 
were giving away the major motivating idea because the soviets do 
want to see us get rid of nuclear weapons said galvin they are 
not so anxious to get rid of conventional weapons 
he was commenting on soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
statement thursday that the warsaw pact could agree on unilateral 
cuts in soviet shortrange nuclear missiles in eastern europe if 
nato would negotiate reductions on those weapons galvin said the 
soviets have 1400 shortrange missiles launchers compared with 
natos 88 
galvin also said that despite the appeal of glasnost or 
openness he questioned whether europe was safer because of the risk 
of soviet instability 
i applaud the way the soviet union is moving said galvin 
but its a rocky road theyre heading down theyre saying they 
cant turn back but they dont know precisely where theyre going 
he also discussed the crash tuesday of a soviet mig23 which 
zoomed across western europe apparently missed by soviet radar 
after its pilot ejected over poland the plane eventually crashed in 
belgium killing a man in his house 
galvin said nato troops ability to spot the jet on radar and 
follow it proved the allied system works 
mathias rust is one thing a little tiny plane flying at low 
altitudes said galvin but this plane took off from their own 
airfield and was flying at high altitude 
he was referring to west german teenager mathias rusts ability 
to evade soviet air defenses two years ago and fly a small plane 
into red square 
two us f15 fighters scrambled from a nato base in the 
netherlands as a policing action as the mig23 crossed into 
western europe on tuesday said galvin they shadowed it hoping it 
would crash into the north sea 
galvin said he accepted moscows explanation that the incident 
was an accident the pilot ejected after reporting the plane was 
smoking the soviets say their radar missed the mig23 as it flew on 
for 500 miles 
galvin said the us pilots did not shoot down the mig23 or move 
alongside and tip it over because it was flying over populated areas

law and rallied in memory of citizens killed during military 
crackdowns waving flags and shouting slogans witnesses and 
diplomats said 
western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred students 
gathered in the center of rangoon official rangoon radio said six 
students were arrested 
up to 1000 students gathered outside the gates of rangoon 
university in an attempt to lay a wreath but armed troops forced 
them to leave said one diplomat who asked not to be identified by 
name 
diplomats reported that soldiers blocked off some streets in an 
effort to control the sporadic protests 
leading opposition figure aung san suu kyi speaking to a crowd 
of several thousand in rangoon repeated her denunciations of the 
ruling military for its refusal to hold talks with opposition 
groups a witness said 
she spoke during a ceremony to remember a massacre of students 
after the 1962 military coup and those killed during army crackdowns 
on prodemocracy protests last year 
dozens of students were killed when the military put down a 
demonstration at rangoon university 26 years ago and blew up the 
student union building 
several thousand were killed last year when troops crushed months 
of prodemocracy demonstrations 
burmas former leader ne win is held responsible for ordering 
both the 1962 and 1988 massacres he officially relinquished control 
in july 1988 but suu kyi has repeatedly charged that he is the 
power behind the nominal head of state saw maung 
suu kyi general secretary of the largest oppostion group the 
national league for democracy has drawn big crowds that have defied 
martial law to hear her speak in rangoon under existing military 
law gatherings of more than five people are forbidden 
general saw maung and u ne win have identical views in their 
disregard for dialogue and civil authority suu kyi said 
residents said many people stayed indoors to avoid anticipated 
clashes and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon 
but witnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a low 
profile and did not attempt to prevent political leaders from 
speaking 
on wednesday more than 10000 burmese rallied to hear suu kyi 
speak in what rangoonbased diplomats said was the largest political 
gathering since last september

community leaders today broke ground 
for a memorial to 14 people who were killed in the collapse of a 
threestory department store during a torrential rain a year ago 
today 
for a brief moment in our daytoday lives everybody in this 
community stopped to climb upon a rock pile and rub elbows with 
some of the people that they pass on a daytoday basis without ever 
stopping said rusty faulk who was local disaster chairman for 
the american red cross 
residents gathered this morning to remember the 14 people who 
died july 7 1988 when the amigo store collapsed in this border

store for each of the victims was donated by the rotary club of 
brownsvillesunrise the memorial also honors the survivors and 
hundreds of people who joined the rescue effort 
mayor ygnacio garza who in the past year has also led the city 
through a hurricane and a series of drug cult murders at nearby 
matamoros mexico said people from out of town most often ask about 
the amigo store disaster 
they remember how the community responded how we worked 
together to save lives garza said 
store owner bernard levin who was in the building when it 
collapsed escaped unscathed but said the thought of death and 
suffering remain 
naturally i feel a little beat levin said wednesday its 
very hard for me to keep going like today it poured down raining 
and i thought back to the amigo store 
dr carmen rocco who treated survivors and consoled families 
while rescuers clawed through the rubble said she recalls events 
just before the disaster and after the site was cleared 
in between there was so much pain and so much tragedy that i 
really blocked it out she said all i really remember is an 
incredible thunderstorm and today we had one of those 
all that remains at the site a year later is vinyl flooring the 
tiles at the entrance and a gaping hole in the downtown business 
district 
levin faces personal injury lawsuits seeking millions of dollars 
in damages the city public utilities board and various 
construction firms and suppliers have been named as defendants too 
among the survivors was 32yearold mexican jose luis gaytan who 
suffered brain damage while trapped in the rubble and no longer is 
able to teach school said ernesto gamez his attorney

of rain on the city in 30 minutes the store was built in 1969 and 
the third floor added in 1975 
dr lorenzo pelly who hitchhiked to the scene from brownsville 
medical center said the first thing i saw there was a guy who 
had his face crushed between a parking meter and a car parked there 
on the street 
pelly said the outpouring of volunteers from throughout the lower 
rio grande valley united the region but he regrets the bickering 
among rescuers and the decision to dig instead of looking first for 
survivors 
survivors were not located until hours later

the us state department went to the panamanian embassy in 
washington and we were given approval to go ahead and board the 
ship karonis said

moslem leaders said today they will ask 
syria for surfacetosurface missiles and tanks to counter new 
missiles reportedly acquired from iraq by their christian foes 
syrian artillery shells continued to besiege the coast of the 
christian enclave north of beirut today police said two people were 
killed and seven wounded 
the deaths raise the toll to 404 people killed and 1558 wounded 
since fighting erupted march 8 between the mainly christian troops 
of gen michel aouns lebanese army and syrianbacked militiamen 
tension also heightened amid reports that 42 christians were 
kidnapped in moslem sectors after syrianbacked moslem forces lifted 
a land blockade of the christian heartland two days ago 
the annahar newspaper reported the kidnappings and aouns 
command said the report was true but police said they knew about no 
abductions 
syrias barrage of christian ports is to prevent aoun from 
receiving armaments but shiite moslem leader nabih berri declared 
today that the christians on thursday received a shipload of 
sovietdesigned frog7 missiles and t54 and t55 tanks from iraq 
berri leader of the mainstream amal militia and syrias closest 
ally in lebanon was speaking in damascus after meeting with 
lebanese druse warlord walid jumblatt 
aouns command refused to comment on the report he has acquired 
the missiles which have a range of 43 miles and can carry warheads 
containing 1210 pounds of explosive 
berri charged the christians will deploy the new armaments 
against moslem forces 
theyre not to threaten syria or any other country he said 
theyre to be used against the lebanese and the parties of the 
national coalition an alliance of six moslem parties 
syria this week charged christian forces received six frog7 
missiles in april and demanded they be removed because they could 
hit damascus if fired from christianheld positions in mountains 
northeast of beirut the mountains are 40 miles from damascus 
berri claimed christian missiles are aimed at my house the 
house of walid jumblatt and at the syrian headquarters in beirut 
he said he has not officially asked syria for the missiles and is 
waiting for president hafez assad to return from his summer 
residence in order to put this request to him 
the syrians must help us we are their allies if they cannot 
or will not then it is our right to seek to purchase such advanced 
weapons from any source berri told reporters 
a statement from his amal militia published by beirut newspapers 
said acquisition of the missiles would lead to a destructive 
catastrophe that will not spare areas in east or west beirut

warsaw pact nations today asked nato to 
present president bushs arms reduction initiatives at the eastwest 
disarmament talks 
officials said they hope details of the proposal will be 
submitted before next week when the current round of talks is to 
end 
were pressing strongly that they present the framework of the 
proposals by the end of this round on july 13 said wlodzimierz 
konarski polish delegation chief at the talks on conventional armed 
forces in europe 
in may bush won nato support for a proposal to reduce us and 
soviet troops in europe to 275000 on each side that would require 
the soviets to withdraw and demobilize 325000 red army soldiers 
bush also proposed limits on tanks armored troop carriers and 
artillery pieces and he said the west is willing to expand its 
proposal to include for the first time landbased combat aircraft 
and helicopters from the atlantic to the soviet ural mountains 
western experts at the western alliance headquarters in brussels 
said last month they would formally present bushs proposals to the 
warsaw pact when talks open for their third round on sept 5 
konarski speaking for the east bloc was optimistic about 
progress but mentioned some differences 
we all now agree that a future agreement should cover six 
categories of conventional armed forces even though a formal 
proposal of our western partners to this effect has not yet been 
submitted konarski told reporters 
he said if the main obstacles were overcome during the next round 
then the agreement could indeed be concluded within 12 months 
the timetable suggested by bush 
nato opened the vienna talks on conventional arms reductions 
march 9 proposing each military bloc reduce three kinds of weapons 
tanks artillery and armored personnel carriers 
the soviet military bloc countered with a far broader less 
specific proposal to reduce six kinds of weapons 10 percent to 15 
percent below present levels by 1994 then add a further 25 percent 
reduction by 1997 before moving to only defensive forces in 2000 
reductions in aircraft are among points of disagreement western 
delegates say aircraft are difficult to count and can be redeployed 
in any disarmed zone within hours konarski made clear the issue is 
of vital importance for the future of the talks the issue of 
aircraft remains to be solved as a matter of priority he said

in manila in the past two weeks in a series of attacks blamed on the 
rebels 
also today a general said he has ordered a closer guard on 31 
soldiers held in the slaying of president corazon aquinos husband 
following reports that three had been seen at the airport 
on june 24 a manila tabloid newspaper peoples tonight said 
the defendants went to the airport to smuggle textiles automotive

the european court of human rights 
ruled today that a west german accused of killing two people in 
virginia should not be extradited to the united states because he 
could receive the death penalty 
the court said the threat of the death penalty is a violation of 
jens soerings human rights soering is being held in britain 
rulings by the court do not technically bind the members of the 
council of europe but they are rarely ignored britain said it 
would study the ruling 
court officials called the judgment a landmark ruling because the 
court normally issues such decisions only after a human rights abuse 
has occurred 
jim updike the bedford county va prosecutor heading the case 
against soering said the decision was illogical he is guilty 
of the extremely brutal murder of two human beings updike told 
the associated press 
the court said if soering is found guilty in virginia he faces 
years on death row and capital punishment such punishment would 
breach his rights under the european human rights convention it 
said 
article 3 of the charter says no one shall be subjected to 
torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
sending 22yearold soering to virginia would expose him to a 
real risk of treatment going beyond the threshold set by article 
3 the court ruled 
it said a promise by virginia justice officials to ask the courts 
to spare his life if he is found guilty was insufficient because it 
did not eliminate the risk of a death sentence 
soering who moved to the united states in 1977 was charged in 
the march 30 1985 killings of william and nancy haysom in their 
bedford county home they were the parents of elizabeth haysom his 
girlfriend at the time 
she is serving a 90year sentence for her part in the killings 
the parents of soerings girlfried were stabbed to death in an 
argument over soerings relationship with their daughter which the 
parents opposed 
soering evaded arrest in virginia but was arrested in britain in 
april 1986 on a check fraud charge in 1988 britain agreed to 
extradite him but soering took his case to the human rights court 
an arm of the 23nation council of europe 
britain is likely now to send soering back to west germany which 
requested his extradition in 1987 to let him stand trial there for 
the virginia murders 
in london a spokesman for the home office which handles law 
enforcement and immigration said only that the ruling will be 
studied 
we will need to consider the judgment fully and carefully he 
said 
one consideration for britain is its interest in preserving the 
1986 extradition treaty with the united states britain is currently 
seeking extradition of an irish republican army member convicted of 
murder in britain who later escaped from prison and was arrested in 
the united states 
the european court of human rights did not say what britain 
should do with soering but judge rolf ryssdal of norway the court 
president who read the ruling said trying soering in west germany 
would not involve suffering of such exceptional intensity or 
duration 
west germany abolished the death sentence in 1949 under its 
laws nationals can be tried for crimes in another country if 
convicted in west germany soering faces a maximum prison sentence 
of 10 to 15 years

secretary of state james a 
baker iii today tried to rally international support around us 
efforts to keep khmer rouge guerrillas from regaining control in 
cambodia

nations asean who are meeting in this island capital southwest of 
the philippines talks began thursday and end saturday 
the leaders are seeking a joint response to vietnams plans to 
withdraw its 60000 to 70000 troops from cambodia by sept 30 the 
khmer rouge and two smaller noncommunist groups are still fighting 
the vietnamesebacked government there 
we are of one mind on what must happen after vietnams 
withdrawal baker said in his speech there is a critical need 
for asean and western unity to ensure the emergence and survival of 
a new independent cambodia this new cambodia must be free to 
determine its own future and it must not be dominated by the 
murderous khmer rouge 
baker said if such efforts failed this lapse could well lead 
to a new period of civil war 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1979 when it was 
ousted by a vietnamese invasion during that time it killed 
hundreds of thousands of people 
baker western allies and the regional association have been 
forging a common stand before an international conference on 
cambodia to be held in paris tentatively starting july 30 they are 
urging a ceasefire powersharing and an international body 
supervised by the united nations to oversee elections and the 
transition to peace 
vietnam has opposed such a un role 
china has confirmed it will send its foreign minister to the 
conference frances deputy foreign minister edwige avice announced 
chinas role is crucial because it is the main source of arms for 
the guerilla coalition 
the asean foreign ministers welcomed the news this presence is 
one of the conditions of the success of the conference said mrs 
avice 
baker also said vietnamese refugees are pouring into asian 
nations because of conditions in their homeland we should keep up 
pressure on it to reform its political and economic system he 
said 
the secretary of state also tried today to reassure the southeast 
asian leaders who fear the major powers will dominate a proposed 
economic alliance for the region officials said 
baker gave the assurances in separate talks with foreign minister 
siddhi savetsila of thailand and foreign minister abu hassan omar of 
malaysia 
the association comprises the noncommunist rapidly developing 
nations of brunei thailand singapore malaysia the philippines 
and indonesia the dialogue partners are the united states japan 
australia canada new zealand and the 12nation european community 
in the talks the united states japan and australia have been 
seeking reactions to their separate proposals for a new forum on 
economic cooperation for the asiapacific region

new group would be to stimulate the free flow of goods and 
commodities according to foreign ministry spokesman jetn 
sucharitkul of thailand 
some group members including malaysia and singapore also say

a white house official has been told to stop 
dealing with certain aspects of the department of housing and urban 
developments budget because she is under congressional scrutiny for 
projects she handled while working at the scandalscarred agency 
janet hale was informed of the move late thursday by budget 
director richard darman not long after she was notified that she 
would be asked to appear before a congressional subcommittee 
investigating allegations of mismangement at hud during the reagan 
administration 
ms hale works in the office of management and budget and her 
duties until thursday included oversight of the entire hud budget 
before moving to the white house she worked for several years at 
hud rising to deputy assistant secretary of housing 
darmans action came a day after hud secretary jack kemp 
announced the suspension of a third agency program providing 
housing for low and moderateincome elderly people as part of the 
probe of corruption and mismanagement at the department 
barbara clay an omb spokeswoman said today that ms hale was 
told not to handle any hud matters that relate to the investigation 
but can continue to work on other agency activities 
congressional investigators are looking into at least two 
projects ms hale handled while at hud including approval of a 
north carolina project involving a longtime friend of former hud 
secretary samuel pierce 
for the time being any matters specifically involving the hud 
investigation or the hud actions under investigation should be 
handled 
without your involvement darman said in a note to ms hale 
he noted that ms hale herself had suggested the reassignment 
after being summoned by the subcommittee i have concluded that 
this is the the best interest of omb and im inclined to think 
that for the periodf of the investigation it is also in your own 
best interest the omb director said 
the memo was first reported in todays editions of the boston 
globe 
kemps decision thursday on the elderlyhousing program follows a 
highly critical audit of the program by huds inspector general that 
said many of the projects were approved despite warnings by agency 
analysts that they were unnecessary or too large 
the program already has cost the government 119 million in 
direct payments to cover defaults on hudinsured mortgages kemp 
said the cost is likely to grow he said because defaults now 
total 250 million and are expected to continue 
kemp also said the program was not serving those it was created 
to help citing a hudbacked project in palm harbor fla that he 
said charged 2100 a month rent for a twobedroom apartment 
he promised to revive the retirement service center program after 
rewriting its guidelines to target resources to lowincome elderly 
insured housing programs administered by hud must by their 
nature take risks kemp said with this program costing 120 
million to date i would rather take these risks by targeting 
resources to lowerincome people 
kemp is reviewing hud programs as congress and law enforcement 
officials investigate allegations of widespread mismanagement during 
the reagan administration 
testimony and other evidence shows influential republican 
consultants were hired by developers to win favor for hud projects 
also thursday an aide to the house subcommittee investigating 
hud and calling ms hale to testify said several prior witnesses 
will be recalled including former hud secretary pierce 
pierce earlier told the subcommittee he had no direct role in 
funding decisions but a former agency official shirley mcvay 
wiseman since has said pierce ordered her to approve funding for a 
north carolina project involving a longtime pierce associate 
also among those to be recalled are thomas t demery former 
assistant secretary for housing lance wilson pierces former top 
aide and republican political consultant paul manafort who has 
admitted influencepeddling to secure hud funding for a new 
jersey project 
the congressional investigation has focused largely on three 
programs huds acquisition and sale of singlefamily property its 
funding for rehabilitation of rental properties and its coinsuring 
of mortgages for certain housing developments 
a dozen private closing agents contracted for the singlefamily 
program are under investigation for allegedly bilking the agency of 
20 million or more 
kemp has suspended the rehabilitation program and canceled 
another program in which hud backed loans for such projects as a 
golf courseresidential complex both involved lobbying by prominent 
republicans 
the fiveyearold elderly housing venture involved 150 
developments kemp said he suspended it because 30 percent of the 
projects whose mortgages were fully backed by hud and another 12 
percent of those in which hud guaranteed 80 percent of the loan were 
in default the second default rate is expected to climb officials 
say 
the program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70 
who can live on their own and afford market rents the centers offer 
such services as central dining and recreation 
an audit of 24 retirement centers in the midwest found six were 
in default or had their mortgages assigned to hud and six were 
considered financially troubled 
in most of those cases hud field offices approved the number of 
apartments sought by developers although agency economists warned 
the local housing market could not support the full project 
in one case hud assumed mortgage payments for a minnesota 
facility that hud economists had recommended be rejected only 76 of 
the complexs 208 units were rented as of may 1988 19 months after 
it opened 
the economist who recommended rejection had noted the development 
would be in an isolated area overlooking a gravel pit clearly 
remote from major population centers 
the audit did not identify the project by name and hud officials 
at the field office that handled the case did not return telephone 
calls thursday 
in another case auditors said the cincinnati hud office agreed 
to insure a 254unit development despite an agency economists 
findings that the market would support just 125 units in may 1988 
nearly three years after new england village opened only 67 of the 
254 units were occupied and the mortgage was in default 
the report listed four projects in cincinnati with mortgages 
totaling 352 million and two others in the minneapolisst paul 
area totaling 179 million that were in default or considered 
financially troubled

the father of two former ptl aides 
testified in their taxevasion trial that they gave him and his wife 
a cadillac jewelry and furs and trips to paris new york and 
northern ireland 
david and james taggart friends of ptl founder jim bakker are 
charged with failing to pay 487000 in income taxes from 1984 to 
1987 
federal prosecutors say they diverted 11 million of ministry 
funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on ptl credit 
cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit card bills 
henry taggarts testimony established that the claims of family 
wealth recalled by his sons coworkers at ptl were false 
let me put this to rest once and for all henry taggart said 
i do not and never did own seven cadillac dealerships 
i did not and never did own one cadillac dealership i worked 
for a cadillac dealer thats it 
today an attorney hired by ptl to fight an effort by the 
internal revenue service to revoke the ministrys taxexempt status 
testified that he was unable to obtain documents on credit card cash 
advances and american express charges that dealt specifically with 
david taggart 
michael wigton a former irs specialist in exempt organizations 
who is now in private practice was retained by ptl in late 1985 to 
fight the irss proposed revocation of ptls taxexempt status the 
irs action stemmed from an audit of ptl of the years 19811983 
in other testimony thursday ptl tax attorney robert gunst 
testified that david taggart bought 100000 worth of jewelry and 
400000 in other purchases the same year he told the irs his 
taxable income was 107000 
did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase items 
worth 500000 when his income was 100000 prosecutor david 
brown asked 
it looks like a mistake was made said gunst who prepared 
taggarts 1984 tax return 
other purchases questioned thursday included a onebedroom 
apartment on the 57th floor of new yorks trump tower which gunst 
said the two brothers bought in 1986 for 640000 
gunst also said that bakker approved using ministry funds to pay 
52000 in back taxes and penalties levied against david taggart 
following an audit of his 1981 and 1982 tax returns 
gunst said he found 25 to 30 boxes of credit card receipts during 
an irs audit of the ministry and was worried that spending by the 
taggart brothers could threaten ptls taxexempt status 
the receipts were there gunst said the issue was whether 
there was substantiation 
i told him the importance of keeping good records gunst 
said i dont know if he was the main problem it looked to me 
that he had provided the documents to support his travel 
both taggarts joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists 
within a few years david taggart 32 had become bakkers top aide 
and james taggart 35 was the ministrys interior designer both 
were fired after bakker resigned in 1987 amid a sex and money 
scandal 
if convicted they each could face 25 years in prison and fines 
of more than 1 million 
in his testimony today wigton described one incident in which he 
was unable to get his hands on american express receipts a set of 
copies he requested from the credit card company was lost at ptl a 
second set of copies also was reported lost by ptl officials he 
said 
they just disappeared said wigton 
most of the missing records had to do with travel expenses and 
other charges incurred by david taggart he said without the 
records wigton said his effort to fight the proposed irs action 
was hampered significantly 
under crossexamination by defense attorney ben cotten wigton 
acknowledged that other records were also missing

the parliament of soviet lithuania passed a law 
this week that goes a step beyond national legislation in giving 
land back to farmers after decades of collectization newspapers 
reported friday 
the law stops short of total decollectivization but would 
without charge give farmers the land they farm now with the right 
to pass it on to heirs according to sovietskaya litva the 
lithuanian communist party daily 
the law does not allow farmers to sell land a step the kremlin 
might view as a violation of the communist ban on ownership of major 
private property 
soviet farms have been owned by the state or by statecontrolled 
collectives since 192930 
the bill could strengthen efforts by the baltic republics of 
lithuania estonia and lativa to become more autonomous they were 
occupied and annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
it was not clear whether the national legislature the supreme 
soviet would try to override the new lithuanian law in the same way 
it vetoed a law passed by the legislature of estonia last fall 
proclaiming autonomy in the republic 
the lithuanian law which has not yet been published in full 
went beyond national legislation passed in april allowing farmers to 
rent land on 50year leases with a right to pass it on to 
descendants 
farmers have been slow to take out leases fearing the reforms 
could be overturned according to poll results published in april by 
the communist party daily newspaper pravda 
the lithuanian law according to the newspaper izvestia said 
land granted to the peasant for use with no fixed term with 
rights of inheritance and without payment does not include the 
right to sale 
activists in the lithuanian grassroots political group sajudis 
had been pushing for more radical legislation that would have 
granted farmers the right to buy and sell land but a compromise was 
reached in the republics legislature said zhilvenas glebus 
reached by telephone in the lithuanian capital of vilnius 
the lithuanian law will go into effect aug 1 according to 
sajudis workers quoting the sovietskaya litva article

when the british middle classes want 
to know how theyre talking dressing loving and hating they need 
only head for the latest alan ayckbourn play 
in three decades of playwriting he has moved beyond his early 
acclaim as a clever farceur to become the voice of an age and a 
people 
in the 1950s british theater had its angry young men writing 
electrifying portrayals of bluecollar british society 
the 1980s have ayckbourn dissecting the underside of the 
entrepreneurial society championed by prime minister margaret 
thatcher with his savagely witty depictions of the suburban nouveaux 
riches and his ear for the way middleclass britons speak 
his work has been performed in over 35 countries and he was most 
recently seen in new york with the offbroadway hit woman in 
mind last year 
he also writes childrens plays minimusicals and revues he was 
andrew lloyd webbers collaborator on the composers one flop to 
date jeeves and has directed as well notably arthur millers 
a view from the bridge 
with the june 13 opening of the revengers comedies the 
50yearold playwright has arrived presenting a twopart 5hour 
morality tale that is winning rave reviews 
its his 37th play the same number william shakespeare wrote 
but it is quality not quantity for which britains busiest 
dramatist hopes to be remembered 
i hope my plays hold up in 400 years thats the real test 
he said in an interview 
the independent in london found it killingly funny 
masterly the new york times said ayckbourn has outdone 
himself and paid tribute to the most extraordinary career in 
contemporary english playwriting 
the play which wont reach londons west end until 1991 was 
launched at the stephen joseph theater in the round in the north 
yorkshire seaside town of scarborough where it will run through 
sept 23 
scarborough is entirely in character with a man whose plays are 
rooted in a sense of place and who himself has little time for the 
pretensions of londons social circuit 
ayckbourn became the theaters artistic director in 1971 im a 
chronicler of small communities he said one sees events and 
people and the rise and fall of individuals in a town such as this 
the revengers comedies begins with a chance encounter by two 
people intent on suicide and examines the consequences of a revenge 
pact that leaves careers houses and people in ruins as the plot 
thickens the tone darkens subverting any notion of ayckbourn as a 
british neil simon 
a similar mix of comedy and tragedy characterizes henceforward 
his current west end hit about a composer writing a symphony 
of love as the world around him slides into hatred and a small 
family business which takes comic aim at the english bourgeoisie 
both plays have us productions on tap henceforward 
which had a 1987 run at houstons alley theater will be staged in 
los angeles next spring a small family business is headed for 
new york in 1990 
these works have led to a reassessment by critics who have tended 
to see ayckbourn as little more than a laugh machine 
the reappraisal became noticeable after woman in mind his 
rending study of a housewife driven mad by her banal suburban 
surroundings 
but the hand of a social anatomist can be seen as far back as 
1972 in absurd person singular in which the vanities and class 
wars of three couples are traced over three christmases 
the norman conquests in 1973 showed his technical virtuosity 
presenting the same story in three intricately linked plays each 
time from the viewpoint of a different participant at a family 
gathering his 1982 intimate exchanges had several different 
endings depending on the toss of a coin 
ayckbourn is celebrated for his craftsmanship i am interested 
in technique i just dont want it to show too much but says 
content is paramount 
i think im a moral dramatist he said absurd person 
singular was the first time i noticed it in myself the story 
of the triumph of mammon a theme thats cropped up a lot since 
although his characters never mention mrs thatcher by name they 
are almost without exception steeped in her capitalist ethos 
im alarmed and worried by some of the attitudes that have come 
out of that philosophy but i think its wider than her she bears 
the title he said 
less preachy than leftist colleagues david hare howard brenton 
and doug lucie ayckbourn calls himself a woolly liberal in the 
middle 
its a little like doing antitory plays at miners galas 
theres no point he said i should be doing plays for 
conservative clubs but in order to do so youve got to get in 
there with a slowburning fuse 
i hope in the end one says the right thing if you like that 
money and power are dangerous not inherently of themselves but in 
the using of them 
this autumn will see the movie version of his 1984 play a 
chorus of disapproval directed by michael winner and starring 
jeremy irons and anthony hopkins its ayckbourns debut as a 
screenwriter but he remains committed to the stage 
in the end film doesnt seem to add much to my work it 
replaces my narrative with a narrative of its own he said 
things inevitably disappear 
the theater is where i get my buzz from i just get excited 
with all the bricks and mortar of it

the communist party newspaper reacted 
angrily to remarks by west germanys finance minister that germany 
should be reunified within its 1937 borders which include about a 
third of poland 
finance minister theo waigel said in hanover on sunday that the 
german reich in its borders of 1937 did not cease to exist with the 
german armys 1945 capitulation to the allies 
waigel said his party the christian social union would never 
allow the demand for reunification of the two germanies to be 
stricken from the west german constitution 
if the old german borders were recognized poland would lose some 
of its largest cities such as wroclaw and szczecin and its biggest 
industrial region in southeastern silesia 
questioning at a revisionist rally the map of postwar europe 
and the irreversible character of the border on the odra and nysa 
rivers minister waigel as a government representative strikes at 
our fundamental national and state rationale said the editorial 
in the polish communist partys trybuna ludu on thursday 
such a line is unacceptable for the polish nation and for 
all poles regardless of their political orientation 
although west germany has been the most active western country in 
promoting relations with the communist countries of central and east 
europe polishwest german relations have been strained by a host of 
bilateral issues 
west germany wants better treatment for the german minority that 
remained in the former german territories after world war ii and 
there is resentment toward the flood of polish emigrants or illegal 
workers who have taken advantage of liberalized passport laws to 
travel to west germany 
poland has accused west germany of insensitivity to its 
sovereignty because of the calls by rightist politicians for old 
german territories and because of west germanys refusal to grant 
economic assistance unless poland makes concessions on the 
minorities issue 
in bonn today a leading solidarity official urged polish 
reconciliation with west germany but said his country should not 
give up any land 
those who question existing borders damage perspectives for 
stability in europe said bronislaw geremek leader of 
solidaritys deputies in the polish parliament 
geremek also said he sees new chances for closer relations 
between germans and poles and that problems holding up an 
agreement in ongoing bilateral talks are only of the second 
order

north carolinas attorney general called 
today for a federal investigation of pricefixing by major oil 
companies saying a state probe showed either greed or collusion is 
behind recent price increases 
greed isnt illegal but price fixing is and that has been the 
focus of our investigation here in north carolina attorney 
general lacy thornburg said 
thornburg said the oil companies have blamed the wreck of the 
exxon valdez in alaska and normal market forces such as increased 
summer demand and higher crude oil prices for the rapid increase in 
gasoline prices over the past four months 
but thornburg said valdez spill was simply a small drop in a 
very large bucket he said crude oil prices have not affected 
prices for other petroleum products such as heating oil and diesel 
fuel 
the oil companies have put forward other excuses for the 
simultaneous gas price increases but their arguments have more 
holes than the hull of the exxon valdez thornburg said 
he said investigators tracked prices for three months from 
retailers back through wholesale terminals and the major 
outofstate suppliers finding that price increases took place at 
the refinery level while profits of wholesalers and retailers 
remained stable 
thornburg said he had forwarded the states investigation and a 
formal request for a federal investigation to us attorney general 
richard thornburgh in washington 
the north carolina official said he also will ask his 
counterparts in other states at a meeting this weekend to form a 
task force to examine the price fixing allegations 
i anticipate we will get a good response from the federal 
government thornburg said we can demonstrate with other states 
a general outcry around the country and when you have a widespread 
public outcry you usually can get a positive response 
it is awfully difficult to prove pricefixing it always has 
been thornburg said but were certainly going to give it our 
best shot

customs procedures around the globe automated through the use of 
electronic data systems us customs service commissioner william 
von raab said friday 
von raab said the 104nation customs cooperation council at 
meetings here this week also adopted resolutions urging strict 
enforcement of drug laws and encouraging member countries to sign a 
un convention on illicit drug trafficking 
he told a news conference that the council has approved a 
strategy through which customs administrations around the world can 
work toward electronic data interchange 
when it comes goods and services will move across 
international borders mostly without paperwork and with the 
absolute minimum of human involvement national laws and regulations 
that interfere with free movement of goods and services will give 
way to laws designed for modern trade and information concepts 
von raab said 
he said that the bottom line will be less expensive 
international trade trade will be less expensive for the business 
community which means lower prices for us all managing that trade 
will be less expensive for customs administrations which means 
lower taxes for us all 
tom hayes secretarygeneral of the customs cooperation council 
which has its headquarters in brussels belgium told reporters the 
group is concerned about a growing gap between industrialized and 
developing countries with regard to their capabilities to automate 
customs procedures technology training and other assistance are 
badly needed by third world nations hayes said

urging member nations to focus attention on the smugglers of small 
quantities of illicit drugs as well as on the smugglers of large 
quantities 
the customs council also approved a resolution calling for all

buoyed by the promise of billions in 
foreign aid president corazon aquino leaves saturday on a 
threenation west european tour in search of financial and political 
support for her troubled country 
philippine officials say mrs aquino will try to exploit her 
image as savior of filipino democracy to encourage greater trade and 
investment to help cope with problems of poverty communist 
insurgency and a 28 billion foreign debt 
she also hopes to dispel european fears that her government has 
been laggard in fulfilling the pledge to protect human rights made 
when she was swept to power in the 1986 uprising that toppled 
ferdinand marcos authoritarian administration 
i would like to deliver to the people and countries of europe 
the message that the philippines is committed to democracy which 
our people restored in a very unique way by peaceful means she 
said in a radio broadcast this week 
mrs aquino will travel to west germany then to france to join 
bicentennial celebration of the french revolution and finally to 
belgium 
mrs aquinos trip her second to europe as president follows a 
commitment wednesday by industrial countries and international 
financial institutions to provide 35 billion in 1989 in aid for 
the philippines as part of the program the european economic 
community promised to triple its aid to about 350 million a year 
the visit represents another step in manilas efforts to expand 
trade and contacts with western europe and broaden its foreign 
policy which traditionally focused on its former colonial power 
the united states 
in february the european parliament expressed support for mrs 
aquino but added it was concerned about mounting human rights 
violations 
human rights groups including amnesty international accuse the 
military and governmentbacked vigilante groups of widespread 
torture assassinations and illegal abductions of suspected rebels 
on flimsy evidence 
officials say mrs aquino will argue her government is committed 
to human rights but faces a serious threat from the 23000member 
communist new peoples army which has been waging a 20year war to 
establish a marxist state 
ten policemen and soldiers have been slain in the manila area in 
the last two weeks in attacks which the military blames on communist 
rebels 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile said friday that mrs aquinos 
trip will reinforce the countrys image as a borrower and a beggar 
he said mrs aquino was leaving behind a nation in turmoil 
on the eve of her departure the government announced the arrest 
of a soldier in the 1988 murder of a leftwing activist and the 
attempted slaying of a companion in one of the countrys bestknown 
human rights cases 
the national bureau of investigation said constable 2nd class 
dioscoro ambagay jr was arrested and warrants have been issued for 
two more soldiers in the slaying of leftist reynaldo francisco and 
an attempt on the life of hilario bustamante in march 1988

killer whales have been sighted in the 
gulf of mexico for the first time in 40 years according to a marine 
biologist who reviewed videotape shot by fishermen 
we dont know how they got here but they are a migratory 
species said bob shipp a marine science professor at the 
university of south alabama in mobile its possible they migrated 
to the warm water in the winter and got trapped here when they 
turned back to head north 
shipp said thursday that he had been skeptical about the sighting 
of the whales which have distinctive black and white coloring and 
are commonly found in colder waters 
but he changed his mind after watching the 10minute tape that 
included three minutes of what he called good footage of the whales 
ranging in size from about 6 feet to 20 feet long the film was shot 
during a fishing tournament last weekend 
fifteen to 20 species of whale inhabit the gulf with pilot and 
beach whales the most common shipp said there was an unconfirmed 
sighting of killer whales last year near the chandeleur islands off 
the louisiana coast 
it appears that they have taken up residency and are actually 
surviving in the gulf said skip grizzle who was on the charter 
boat when the video was made

the united nations has halted refugee 
flights to the capital of namibia because resettlement camps are 
overflowing a un spokesman said friday 
the refugees most of them supporters of the guerrilla movement 
that fought for 23 years against south african rule have stayed in 
the camps around windhoek longer than the seven days the un high 
commissioner for refugees had planned on 
un spokesman fred eckhard said the refugees are reluctant to 
leave and go to their home villages in the north where the 
southwest african peoples organization has most of its support 
because they fear namibian police will harass them 
refugees who have been flown into northern cities have moved out 
of the temporary settlement camps and those flights will continue 
eckhard said the united nations has arranged for representatives in 
the camps near windhoek to travel to the north see the situation 
and report back with the hope that the refugees in the camps will 
be persuaded to leave 
the un spokesman said 16244 of the 41000 namibians registered 
with the un high commissioner for refugees have returned so far 
mostly from swapo camps in angola and zambia 
all refugees are to return by sept 15 the end of the 
registration period for voting in elections planned for november 
he said two planeloads of namibians from cuba were due to arrive 
on july 18 and july 24 and that small groups have returned from 
britain and the united states 
swapo said before the independence process began that it was 
caring for some 80000 refugees with un aid but there has been no 
explanation for the change in numbers 
about 150 refugees who returned this week had been held prisoner 
by swapo in angolan camps in response to their tales of torture and 
allegations that swapo is holding hundreds more prisoners martti 
ahtisaari the un special representative in namibia appealed 
friday for all prisoners on both sides to be freed under terms of 
un resolution 435 
south africa has withdrawn all but 1500 of its troops from the 
territory it has ruled since 1915 and has agreed to grant namibia 
independence 
but louis pienaar the south african administrator of the 
territory until it becomes independent said wednesday he will not 
free about 30 swapo prisoners held by the police until a full 
accounting is made of all prisoners who may still be in the hands of 
the guerrilla movement

drunkendriving roadblocks violate the 
rhode island constitution even if they are operated under guidelines 
the us supreme court has implied are acceptable the state supreme 
court ruled friday 
the roadblocks are an invasion of privacy under the state 
constitutions declaration of rights which is stricter than the 
federal bill of rights the high court said in a 32 decision 
police officials said the ruling would have little practical 
effect because few rhode island police departments use roadblocks 
but one police chief who favors them said the ruling could lead to 
more injuries and deaths from drunken drivers 
how about the innocent peoples rights said central falls 
police chief robert choquette who used the roadblocks until doubts 
about their constitutionality arose last summer i dont think 
its giving a fair shake to the innocent person walking down the 
street 
narragansett police capt john odonnell said his department 
abandoned the practice a couple of years ago because roadblocks were 
not costeffective and providence police capt frank devine agreed 
that his officers could catch more drunken drivers by patrolling 
than by setting up a fixed roadblock 
south kingstown police chief vincent vespia jr president of the 
rhode island police chiefs association said he does not use 
roadblocks because he agrees with the courts reasoning 
the concept of reasonable grounds to stop someone isnt there 
when you set up roadblocks to stop everybody he said 
the ruling voided the conviction of joao pimental who was found 
guilty of refusing to submit to a chemical test after he was stopped 
by warren police during a roadblock oct 10 1986 
although the us supreme court has not ruled on drunkendriving 
roadblocks it did imply in a 1979 ruling that they would be 
acceptable under certain limited conditions 
the justices agreed that the warren roadblock would probably pass 
federal muster because police gave adequate notice conducted it 
with minimal interference to the public and had limited discretion 
in deciding which cars to stop 
however chief justice thomas f fay and two other justices said 
the state constitution bars roadblocks no matter how carefully they 
are operated 
it is well beyond dispute that drunk drivers are a grave menace 
to the public and that stronger measures are needed to cope with 
this problem fay wrote however it would shock and offend the 
framers of the rhode island constitution if we were to hold that the 
guarantees against unreasonable and warrantless searches and 
seizures should be subordinated to the interest of efficient law 
enforcement 
justice donald f shea in dissent said the majority did not 
have the justifiable and principled rationale it needed to 
depart from previous us supreme court rulings 
the minimal intrusion on the drivers privacy rights is 
reasonable and fully within the safeguards provided by the rhode 
island constitution shea wrote

conservative fundraiser carl r spitz 
channell was placed on two years probation today for illegally 
using a taxexempt foundation to raise donations to help arm the 
nicaraguan contras 
channell was sentenced by us district judge stanley s harris 
on his guilty plea to conspiracy to defraud the treasury 
channell had admitted raising 2 million to help arm the contras 
from private donors who were told they could deduct from their 
income taxes money given to the taxexempt national endowment for 
the preservation of liberty weapons purchases are not a deductible 
purpose of a taxexempt foundation 
harris said it was very difficult to impose a sentence when 
crimes have been committed by someone so firmly dedicated to 
furthering the interests of the country 
the judge said that because of channells early cooperation with 
irancontra prosecutors he was placing him on probation 
michael bromwich an associate independent counsel told harris 
that channell has fully lived up to the terms of his cooperation 
agreement 
malice never entered my decisions my heart or my mind because 
i love this country channell told harris 
i suffer more because i have committed a crime against the 
country which i love so much said channell 
channells sentencing came a day after his former associate 
richard r miller was placed on two years probation and ordered to 
perform 120 hours of community service for his inolvement in the 
fundraising effort 
harris did not explain why he did not order channell to perform 
any community service 
channell and miller both cooperated with independent counsel 
lawrence e walshs investigation of the irancontra affair and 
testified as prosecution witnesses at the trial of former white 
house aide oliver l north 
they both entered guilty pleas early in the investigation to 
charges of conspiring to defraud the treasury by using a taxexempt 
foundation to raise money for the nondeductible purpose of buying 
weapons for the contras 
miller admitted helping raise 32 million to help the rebels 
both miller and channell could have been sentenced up to five years 
in prison and fined up to 250000 
channell and miller said north was part of their conspiracy to 
use the national endowment for the preservation of liberty to raise 
money for the contras from such private donors as texas billionaire 
nelson bunker hunt 
at the time us military aid to the rebels was banned by 
congress 
north was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury that 
convicted him of trying to cover up the irancontra affair and of 
illegally accepting a home security system from arms dealer richard 
v secord 
on wednesday north was fined 150000 placed on two years 
probation and ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service 
during thursdays proceeding harris said miller had suffered a 
number of adversities as a result of his guilty plea i need not 
impose more for justice to be served the judge said 
miller told harris i let my guard down it may have been blind 
patriotism but thats no excuse he said helping the contras 
was a cause that meant everything to me and in that fervor i 
turned a blind eye to the excesses of others and i crossed the line 
myself 
outside the courthouse associate independent counsel david 
zornow said miller came forward at a very early stage of the 
investigation to admit his wrongdoing pleaded guilty to a very 
serious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government 
he lived up to his agreement with the government zornow 
said this closes the chapter on mr miller

september were held despite martial law which forbids gatherings 
of more than five people

chanted slogans from last years national uprising and bearing red 
fighting peacock flags dodged armed troops

armed troops said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
authorities arrested six student demonstrators said

ms suu kyi head of national league for democracy spoke during 
a ceremony to remember the killings of students after the 1962 
military coup and those who died during army crackdowns on 
prodemocracy protests last year 
dozens of students were killed when the military put down a 
demonstration at rangoon university 26 years ago and blew up the 
student union building 
in september several thousand were killed in a series of 
crackdowns by troops 
socialist strongman ne win is held responsible for ordering the 
killings in 1962 and 1988 he officially relinquished control a year 
ago but ms suu kyi repeatedly has said he is the power behind 
nominal head of state saw maung 
gen saw maung and u ne win have identical views in their 
disregard for dialogue and civil authority ms suu kyi told the 
crowd friday 
on wednesday saw maung insisted ne win retired but added we

the government has issued a decree 
empowering authorities to conscript civilians to work in 
emergencies threatening the economy apparently to counter a 
massive exodus of ethnic turks 
authorities can send civilians to work anywhere in the country 
under the decree 
western diplomats and journalists who have visited areas where 
ethnic turks lived say many towns and villages are nearly empty and 
fields remain unharvested 
austrian tv showed footage this week from bulgaria of fields 
strewn with unharvested fruit and rotting vegetables 
about 100000 ethnic turks have fled to turkey in recent months 
claiming they have been victimized by an assimilation campaign begun 
in 1984 which bans them from using their turkish names speaking 
turkish or practicing islamic rites 
bulgarias state council issued the decree on june 30 but it was 
not published until this week western diplomats said excerpts were 
made available to the associated press on friday 
according to the decree men aged 18 to 60 and women 18 to 55 can 
be mobilized nationwide or on a regional basis it did not say for 
how long 
people can be called up to ensure the necessary manpower and 
equipment in emergencies or natural calamities presenting 
considerable difficulties to the national economy and to the 
country 
invalids pregnant women and mothers of children under 7 are 
exempt 
those who evade civilian mobilization or without a plausible 
reason fail to fulfill their assignments will be fined up to 
3000 the decree said 
mobilized civilians will be paid according to undisclosed norms 
established by the council of ministers it said 
diplomats in sofia said they have no information that any 
mobilization has begun and the decree does not say when it takes 
effect 
ethnic turks make up the main workforce in parts of eastern and 
southern bulgaria especially in agricultural tobacco and food 
production 
turkish premier turgut ozal said earlier this week that bulgaria 
is suffering labor shortages and economic hardships as a result of 
the exodus

security forces armed with emergency 
laws arrested at least 49 suspected sinhalese radicals as continuing 
civil unrest claimed 25 lives the government said friday 
military and police operating under new shootonsight orders 
killed eight radicals in skirmishes when they made the arrests the 
information department said ten radicals were injured it said 
extremists of the leftwing peoples liberation front killed 12 
civilians three soldiers and a police officer since wednesday the 
statement said 
no further details were given to the press working under strict 
censorship laws clamped thursday to coincide with a government 
crackdown on the antigovernment extremists a nationwide emergency 
was imposed june 20 
the countrys two main newspapers friday warned that censoring 
the news fuels rumors 
critical editorials in the island and the sun newspapers were 
submitted to government censors sources at the dailies said the 
editorials were approved without changes 
tongues wag in sri lanka censorship will be of no avail 
said the island the danger of censorship is that all fantastic 
rumors tend to gain more credibility 
the sun said what must necessarily be stressed is the futility 
of the exercise as censorship often in the past turned out to be 
counterproductive with the technical stoppage of news and views 
the flow of rumor gossip and electronic teletalk takes over with 
no holds barred 
police in colombo meanwhile said leading human rights activist 
and criminal lawyer charita lankapura was shot and killed friday by 
two unidentified men no details were released 
sinhalese radicals launched a campaign to topple the government 
two years ago to protest peace overtures being made to tamil rebels 
demanding an independent nation in the northeast 
the sinhalese front says too many concessions are being made to 
the minority tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population 
the front has been blamed for killing 3500 people in two years 
mostly government officials governing party members and security

president bush today asked congress to give 
some 7200 federal executives pay increases of 8 percent to 25 
percent with even higher raises going to a selected 200 with 
special skills 
however the president coupled his payraise plan with a proposal 
that the officials justify their right to the higher salaries every 
three years to be able to keep receiving them 
bushs proposal would give full 25 percent hikes to just the most 
senior officials matching a salary hike he has already advocated 
for federal judges 
more junior officials would get smaller increases at least 
initially under the plan 
the president also called for a phaseout of congressional 
peechmaking honoraria over a twoyear period and said it should be 
linked to a pay raise for lawmakers but he stopped short of 
recommending a specific level 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush wanted 
congress to take the initiative on that politically touchy subject 
itself but that he was ready to work with congressional leaders on 
a complete package 
the plan would raise the pay of top federal officials including 
cabinet members to 124400 from the present 99500 
it would also raise the salary of vice president dan quayle from 
115000 to 143000 but it would not affect bushs 200000 salary 
the total pay package would cost taxpayers 101 million in the 
fiscal year that begins next oct 1 and 147 million in the 
following fiscal year fitzwater said 
he said the increases would be in addition to a 36 percent 
costofliving increase the president is seeking for 22 million 
federal workers 
the package would for the first time set up a special super 
category for federal employes with special talents enabling them to 
get salaries up to the 124400 top level fitzwater said 200 
individuals would qualify for these special salaries to be 
determined at a later time 
he suggested that nuclear scientists physicians or others with 
special talents would be the type of individual considered for the 
special salaries 
the most controversial part of the new package however may be 
the requirement that all members of the senior executive service 
undergo a recertification process every three years to keep their 
higher salaries 
the procedure is designed to assure that these people perform 
at a level that justifies the higher salary we do not believe it 
would weaken their rights fitzwater said 
he said the certification would not apply to the governments 700 
highlevel political appointees like cabinet members and others 
appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate because 
they can be removed at any time without appeal by the president 
the 7200 members of the senior executive service and 700 appoint 
executives currently make 68700 to 80700 their pay is tied to 
the 89500 that members of congress get and lawmakers rejection 
of a proposed 51 percent congressional pay increase in february 
meant no raise for them or for judges 
a private commission headed by former federal reserve board 
chairman paul volker has recommended a 25 percent increase 
immediately followed by a similar amount in 1991 applying to 
judges executive branch officials members of congress and others 
such as top military officers

president bushs decision to forgive some 
african debt includes 16 nations and totals about 1 billion 
officials said friday 
bushs announcement thursday will ease the debt burden starting 
oct 1 for benin cameroon ghana guinea ivory coast kenya 
madagascar malawi mali niger nigeria senegal somalia 
tanzania uganda and zaire 
one official estimated the face value of the loans at 590 
million to 600 million the rest would be interest already due or 
expected to become due over the life of the loans 
an additional 400 million will be forgiven to seven other 
countries if they adopt new economic policies to put themselves into 
better financial shape in cooperation with the world bank and the 
international monetary fund the officials added but they said some 
of the seven such as ethiopia are not likely to adopt such 
programs 
the others are zimbabwe sudan liberia botswana zambia and 
swaziland 
the officials from the state department and the agency for 
international development spoke on condition that their names not be 
used 
though latin america has much heavier debt than africa the 
burden on many african countries is considered heavier because their 
populations are much poorer and smaller 
the forgiveness was announced thursday by president bush at a 
news conference for nonamerican reporters and stems from last 
years economic summit the leaders of the seven major noncommunist 
governments including bush will meet in paris next week for a 
meeting 
one state department official said the other nations already have 
forgiven most of such debt owed to them and so have some other 
creditors including the nordic countries and the netherlands 
one aid official explained that many of the debts to the united 
states go back as much as 30 years more recently aid to the poorest 
countries has been given in the form of grants as it was when major 
us aid programs began in the 1940s 
some of the grants have been going to pay interest on the old 
loans the official added 
some debtor governments have not been paying for years so that 
forgiving their debts will not have much practical effect for them 
the loans to be forgiven were made for development projects and 
as economic aid to countries considered strategically important to 
the united states the officials said there would be no effect on 
loans given by the governments exportimport bank to encourage the 
sale of us industrial products by the agriculture department to 
encourage the sale of farm products or by the defense department for 
weapons and training

tomatoes soon may become deadly enemies of 
the caterpillars that love to gnaw on them 
a gene from bacteria researchers say cant hurt other living 
things will be inserted in tomato seeds letting plants and fruit 
that germinate from those seeds ward off caterpillartype insects 
without use of artificial pesticides 
when the insect eats the plant it ingests that bacterium and 
dies said david c hulst director of hulst research farm 
services where a field trial on caterpillarresistant tomatoes is 
being conducted this summer 
the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis is fatal only to organisms 
with a specific alkaline level in their systems making it dangerous 
only to the caterpillar family hulst said 
hulst said the bacterium is natures way of controlling the 
number of caterpillartype insects 
its one of those antagonisms put in nature to reduce 
populations of certain insects hulst said during a tour of the 
test field it is possible that without this bacteria in the 
environment the insects might eat everything around 
the us department of agriculture agreed to the field test at 
monsanto co last month but approval for general use is several 
years away said roy fuchs a monsanto researcher who directed the 
lab work that prepared the way for field tests 
researchers predict widespread use of this biological control 
because of growing concern about environmental effects from 
pesticides that dont always keep insects at or below acceptable 
levels fuchs said in a telephone interview from his office in st 
louis he cited department of agriculture statistics that farmers 
spend 150 million annually on chemical insecticides yet 
caterpillartype insects alone cause 450 million damage a year 
theres a real need for alternatives fuchs added thats 
what will make or break the technology for farmers to see a real 
benefit and were confident they will when they have a chance to 
look at insecttolerant plants 
a big advantage of the bacteria approach is that it has a very 
long history of safe and effective use in agriculture said trevor 
suslow spokesman for dna plant technologies a pesticide laboratory 
that is not directly involved in the tomato research 
however he said one major concern is that widespread use of 
bacterial pesticides will cause insects to develop resistance more 
quickly 
field tests are being conducted at four locations by independent 
contractors to give monsanto and environmental protection agency 
researchers a broad geographic spectrum of the types of caterpillars 
the new tomatoes will kill 
tests began in illinois two years ago and have spread to florida 
and mexico to see if they will halt tomato pinworms and to hughson 
100 miles southeast of san francisco to determine the effect on 
tomato fruit worms and beet armyworms the protein also has been 
tested on tobacco plants 
fuchs said taste tests will be conducted later but he doesnt 
think the protein will alter the flavor of the tomato 
monsanto which hopes to begin licensing the results of its gene 
research to seed companies by the mid1990s also is studying its 
use to control cotton bollworms and is looking into its 
possibilities with other vegetables 
any vegetables that have caterpillar insect problems could 
benefit from this technology fuchs said

former leader janos kadar will be buried 
july 14 a day after president bush ends his visit to hungary state 
radio reported friday 
the funeral for kadar who died thursday comes less than one 
month after an elaborate reburial ceremony for imre nagy the leader 
of the failed 1956 uprising who was executed on charges of high 
treason under kadars leadership in 1958 
kadar will be interred at the imre mezoe cemetery in budapest 
where senior communist leaders traditionally are buried the radio 
gave no other details 
according to a medical report issued by mti state news agency 
friday kadar died of respiratory and circulatory failure after 
suffering increasing respiratory difficulties for 15 years 
only a few hours after kadar died the hungarian supreme court 
declared nagy innocent of all the charges against him 
hundreds of thousands of hungarians turned out for nagys funeral 
june 16 the 31st anniversary of his execution 
it was seen as the end of kadars era a period marked by 
relative prosperity in the 1970s fostered by cautions economic 
reforms kadar endorsed and ensuing stagnation as the reforms were 
stalled and foreign debt mounted 
many people stopped on budapest streets seemed relieved at his 
passing 
the communist party daily nepszabadsag carried interviews friday 
with the four members of the ruling communist party presidium who in 
a leadership reshuffle in may 1988 removed kadar from the post he 
had held for 32 years and embarked on wideranging political and 
economic reforms 
karoly grosz described kadar as a man of extraordinary 
decency and said he continued to consult the former leader daily 
for months after he took over from him as party general secretary 
last year 
imre pozsgay the partys leading reformer told the newspaper 
that kadar had done what he could under the circumstances a clear 
reference to the orthodox kremlin leadership of leonid brezhnev 
it was the constraint of the given circumstances that 
unavoidably led to kadars weakness showing as he continued to serve 
the cause of the nation pozsgay said

when it comes to aerobic exercise most americans 
apparently say no sweat also no running walking swimming or other 
strenuous activity federal health officials have found 
the centers for disease control reported friday that at least 
five of 11 physical fitness goals for 1990 which it outlined at the 
beginning of the decade probably wont be met 
evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the 
incidence of many medical conditions the cdc said in its 
weekly report citing the benefits of exercise in fighting heart 
disease colon cancer diabetes and obesity 
nonetheless the agency concluded objectives for participation 
in regular physical activity will not be fully met 
here are some of the the governments 1990 objectives for the 
nation published in 1980 and the progress or lack thereof 
thats been made 
the proportion of adults ages 1865 participating three times a 
week in vigorous 20minute exercise should exceed 60 percent 
unlikely to be met a 198487 survey shows that only about 8 percent 
of adults exercise regularly at such a level 
half of americans 65 and older should walk swim or engage in 
other appropriate aerobic exercise at least three times a week 
not likely a 1985 survey showed that while 46 percent of older 
americans said they walked for exercise only 8 percent met the 
threetimesaweek 20minute level 
more than 90 percent of kids ages 1017 should participate three 
times a week in 20minute sessions of vigorous exercise not likely 
a 1984 survey found only 66 percent of children exercised at that 
level 
more than 60 percent of children 1017 should participate in 
daily school physical education programs not likely a 1984 survey 
placed the figure at 36 percent only up by 3 percent from a 1974 
survey 
more than 70 percent of us adults ought to know that 
cardiovascular health is best promoted by exercising at least three 
times a week for 20 minutes or more and at a level that makes 
heart rate and breathing a lot faster but not so much that 
talking is impossible not likely a 1985 survey found that fewer 
than 40 percent got those questions right 
the only goal deemed likely to be met having more than 25 
percent of large companies offer some kind of fitness program a 
1985 survey found that 32 percent of work sites with 250749 
employees and 54 percent of those with 750 or more offered fitness 
programs 
one other goal may be achieved having more than half of doctors 
include exercise history in their initial examinations of new 
patients a 1981 check in two states massachusetts and maryland 
found that 47 percent of doctors routinely asked about exercise 
other goals involved more technical matters of health services 
and fitness evaluation techniques 
there are a number of avenues of research attempting to get at 
the answers why exercisers exercise and why nonexercisers 
dont said dr gregory w heath a cdc researcher among the 
reasons being studied he said are ignorance of exercises 
benefits poor access to exercise opportunities and attitudes 
against exercise 
heath noted that exercise at lower levels of intensity while not 
matching the official fitness goals can still bring fitness and 
health benefits the goals for the year 2000 now in the works may 
allow for people who prefer less vigorous exercise he said

strasbourg france in a landmark ruling friday the european 
court of human rights said a west german must not be extradited to 
the united states because he could face execution if he is convicted 
of a double murder 
jens soering 22 who is jailed in britain is wanted for the 
stabbing deaths of a girlfriends parents in virginia in 1985 the 
british government agreed last year to his extradition 
but the court in strasbourg said if soering is sent to virginia 
the prospect of execution violates his rights under the european 
human rights convention whose charter bans inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment 
the applicants extradition to the united states would expose 
him to a real risk of treatment banned under the european human 
rights charter the court ruled 
the court said if soering were sent instead to west germany 
which also has asked for his extradition he would not face the 
death penalty and would not serve years on death row which the 
court said also violates the charter 
court officials said the ruling broke new ground because it 
involved human rights abuses that had not yet occurred 
normally the court has the power to rule only on violations 
of human rights said paul mahoney a lawyer at the court 
rulings by the rights court a branch of the 23nation council of 
europe are not binding on the 23 council nations but are rarely 
ignored 
soering was arrested in britain on a check fraud charge in april 
1986 after evading arrest in the united states where he is charged 
in the march 30 1985 slayings of william and nancy haysom in their 
home in bedford county va 
elizabeth haysom his girlfriend at the time is serving a 
90year sentence for her part in the killings 
the court did not address soerings guilt in the deaths of the 
parents opposed soerings relationship with their daughter 
mahoney said soering has admitted to participating in the 
killings but has given differing accounts of the circumstances 
sending soering to west germany would not involve suffering of 
such exceptional intensity or duration said rolv ryssdal of 
norway the courts president 
the ruling noted inmates spend between six and eight years on 
virginias death row as their cases go through a lengthy review 
process 
west germany abolished the death penalty in 1949 if convicted in 
west germany soering faces a maximum prison sentence of 10 to 15 
years 
ryssdal said the courts ruling against extradition also took 
into account soerings state of mind and that he was 18 at the time 
of the killings 
psychiatrists have said he had lost his personal identity in a 
symbiotic relationship with his girlfriend a powerful persuasive 
and disturbed young woman 
the court ordered the british government to pay soerings legal 
costs of about 42720 it dismissed minor claims by soering 
including the allegation he did not get a fair hearing in british 
courts that considered the us extradition request 
sen alfonse damato rny who was in strasbourg for soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs speech to the council of europe 
denounced the ruling as indefensible 
jim updike the bedford county va prosecutor heading the case 
against soering said the decision was illogical he is guilty 
of the extremely brutal murder of two human beings updike told 
the associated press 
the european court of human rights is a body of council of 
europe the oldest organization striving for european unity it was 
founded in 1949 and is separate from the 12nation european economic 
community

a politically hostile honduran government in 1931 the united states 
was misinformed that garay was serving in the honduran military at 
the time and his us citizenship was withdrawn 
he returned to the united states in 1985 after decades as a 
banker and then a retiree in honduras

former gen arnaldo ochoa who fought 
alongside fidel castro and became one of cubas bestknown war 
heroes was sentenced to death by firing squad friday for helping 
smuggle tons of cocaine into the united states the official cuban 
news agency said 
three other former officers also were condemned by a 
courtmartial which handed out prison sentences ranging from 10 
years to 30 years to 10 other defendants prensa latina said in 
dispatches monitored in mexico 
castros regime launched an unprecedented and highly publicized 
investigation into ochoa aimed at erasing a stain on the nation and 
the communist party 
ochoas actions constituted an attack on the credibility of 
president fidel castro and weakened the prestige and defense of the 
cuban revolution prosecutor brig gen juan escalona said in his 
summation wednesday 
for years the united states had been accusing cuba of allowing 
drug traffickers to operate an accusation castro indignantly 
dismissed as a us plot to discredit cuba 
but embarrassingly the accusations turned out to be true a 
military hearing and the separate courtmartial revealed details of 
an operation that used cuba as a way station for smuggling cocaine 
from colombas medellin cartel into southern florida 
the courtmartial made up of three senior generals sentenced 
ochoa excol antonio de la guardia font exmaj armado padron and 
excapt jorge martinez to death all were stripped of their rank 
and expelled from the party last week after the hearing before a 
47officer court of honor 
the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty for three other 
officers eduardo diaz antonio sanchez and alexis lago but the 
tribunal sentenced them to 30 years in prison 
prensa latina hailing the verdicts as a reflection of the 
exercise of democracy and legality in cuba said appeals to cubas 
supreme military court and the council of state were being 
expedited it said the defendants had admitted guilt but were asking 
for mercy based on their records and contrition 
the fall of ochoa was most impressive because of his background 
and standing he fought alongside castro in the sierra maestra in 
the 1950s battling and eventually defeating the forces of dictator 
fulgencio batista 
ochoa earned the prestigious hero of the republic of cuba medal 
for his command of troops in ethiopia in 1978 and in angola in 
19871988 he also headed cubas military advisory mission to 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government in 198586 
prosecutor escalona told the court that ochoa robbed the 
nicaraguans of big sums of money betrayed the angolans with 
black market deals and planned to build a mansion with fine woods 
from the angolan jungles 
he profited from the hunger of the angolan people with the 
flour salt and fish that hungry angolan stomachs clamored for and 
thousands of children died simply because they lacked these 
items escalona said in his summation 
the smuggling ring apparently was centered in an interior 
ministry unit headed by de la guardia and dedicated to circumventing 
the 1963 us trade embargo on cuba 
in addition to drugs the officers were convicted of smuggling 
diamonds ivory sugar manufactured goods and us dollars 
confessions and testimony showed the ring worked with the 
medellin cartel for at least 2 years and allowed tons of cocaine 
from colombia and shiploads of jamaican marijuana to pass through 
cuban waters and airspace into the united states 
prensa latina said 12 million and 423000 pesos in cash were 
seized along with 39 expensive automobiles a motorcycle and 186 
firearms ochoa also had a secret bank account in panama it said 
defense minister raul castro fidels brother told the court 
ochoa had been spreading around gifts and handing out objects of 
value mainly to officers in a delirious excercise of 
selfindulgence of the creation of an image and links of gratitude 
to his person 
that seemed to imply that ochoa was building his own power base 
perhaps to challenge or gain a measure of independence from the 
castro brothers 
rosa maria abierno miguel ruiz and patricio de la guardia 
antonios twin brother also were sentenced to 30 years in prison 
five more than the prosecution had requested prensa latina said 
maria abierno was a captain and de la guardia was a brigadier 
general the ranks of the other defendants were not known 
the prosecution had requested a 15year sentence for antonio 
rodriguez but the tribunal reduced that to 10 years because there 
was no evidence he took part in the drug smuggling the agency said 
prensa latina said three other defendants were given 25year 
sentences in earlier dispatches it had identified them as leonel 
estevez jose luis pineda and gabriel prendes 
gen jose abrantes fernandez was sacked as interior minister for 
failing to detect the smuggling ring in his department 
the courtmartial and military hearing included publicity about 
the participants own guilty feelings for betraying the revolution 
defendants were shown on cuban tv with heads bowed as they were 
denounced as traitors ochoa was shown saying he deserved to die

the bush administration today slapped a 
permanent import ban on 43 types of assaultstyle firearms whose 
shipment into the country has been suspended since spring 
stephen e higgins director of the treasury departments bureau 
of alcohol tobacco and firearms said the government had studied 50 
styles of semiautomatic weapons imported in the country and had 
decided to ban all but seven of them permanently 
the bureau has been studying the use of the suspended weapons to 
determine if they fit the requirement that they be used for sporting 
purposes 
the gun control act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons that 
are not used for legitimate sporting purposes 
the study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in 
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of 
their use in violent crime higgins said 
as a result of the study 43 of the weapons were classified 
officially as semiautomatic assault rifles and as such were barred 
from further importation 
higgins said in april that the weapons under study were 
basically paramilitary in appearance they are largecapacity 
magazines 
of the seven models exempted from the import ban six are 22 
rimfire caliber rifles and the other a gun called the valmet hunter 
which had been considered an ak47 type of weapon during the 
suspension the seven models may be imported again higgins said 
the ban will affect about 750000 weapons that importers wanted 
to bring into the country he said the suspension had covered new 
import permits as well as those weapons for which permits already 
had been granted and which were en route to this country 
higgins estimated that the customs service has seized about 
20000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into the 
country unless purchased by law enforcement agencies asked at a 
news conference whether the government will pay damages to 
importers he said thats something the court would decide 
three importers already have brought suit against the government 
over the suspension although a federal court has upheld the 
government in one of the cases higgins said atf would accept 
comments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days the 
final regulations would be issued very quickly after that he 
said 
the bureau which has the power to control imports does not 
regulate domestic manufacture of weapons so similar weapons made in 
the united states would not be affected by the action several bills 
pending in congress would control or eliminate many of the usmade 
assaultstyle weapons 
atf has estimated that domestic makes account for threequarters 
of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by americans colt 
industries inc suspended sales of its ar15 the most popular of the 
domestic assaultstyle semiautomatic rifles in march 
president bush a hunter and a lifetime member of the national 
rifle association which opposes limits on weapons came into office 
opposing any bans on the assaultstyle weapons 
a public outcry over the availability of the weapons was 
triggered in january when a man opened fire with an ak47 and other 
weapons on a schoolyard in stockton calif killing five children 
the man patrick purdy later killed himself 
semiautomatic versions of assault weapons such as the ak47 and 
the uzi carbine have become popular with drug gangs and their use 
in illegal activities has skyrocketed in the past year according to 
law enforcement officials the uzi carbine has been imported since 
the late 1970s 
a study by the atlanta journalconstitution found that an 
assaultstyle gun is 20 times more likely to be used in crime than a 
conventional firearm 
sarah brady chairwoman of handgun control inc today praised 
the atfs action saying it confirms what was long known that 
these imported assault weapons do not serve a legitimate sporting 
purpose 
i commend president bush for his leadership in working toward 
reducing assault weapon violence by stopping the import of these 
weapons of war said mrs brady whose husband former white house 
press secretary jim brady was severely wounded in the 1981 
assassination attempt on president reagan it is no more 
acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing machines 
wearing a made in the usa label than by those made abroad 
the nra declined to comment on the action until it was formally 
announced but john m snyder spokesman for the citizens committee 
for the right to keep and bear arms denounced it in advance 
i think that it shows that the undependability of government 
because originally the atf had certified that these rifles could be 
imported because they are suitable for sporting purposes snyder 
said i think it also tends to further undermine whatever 
credibility president bush has left with the firearmsowning 
community in the united states 
the nra has opposed limits on the rights of lawabiding citizens 
to own the weapons saying the solution to any problem is to lock up 
criminals nra members noted that purdy had been convicted of 
numerous offenses but spent relatively little time in custody and 
was able to evade regulations in order to buy the guns he used in 
his murderous attack on the school yard 
the nra has argued that the inner workings of the weapons in 
question are identical to those of weapons that have been around for 
decades and that limits on them could adversely affect those who 
own semiautomatic hunting rifles 
the study to determine how the imported weapons were being used 
began in march when treasury secretary nicholas brady who oversees 
the atf imposed a suspension on imports of five categories of the 
weapons including the semiautomatic version of the ak47 and uzi 
carbines 
brady took the action at the urging of william j bennett the 
director of national drug control policy who had been told by bush 
to determine what should be done about the weapons 
bush widened the suspension on imports a month later to include 
two dozen additional styles of guns 
at the same time he called for a limit on magazine size to 15 
shots legislation introduced by sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
called for a magazine limit of 20 shots 
the weapons on the original suspension list come primarily from 
china israel west germany and belgium others are made in austria 
australia italy and switzerland among other countries

colleagues friday to monitor the progress of usbrokered peace 
accords on southern africa as doubts clouded the future of talks to 
end angolas civil war 
herman cohen assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
is expected to meet separately with angolan officials to discuss 
bilateral relations and a ceasefire agreed to june 22 by president 
jose eduardo dos santos and angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi 
both dos santos and savimbi have denounced violations of the 
truce that was to silence guns in this southern african nation on 
june 24 both indicate they want peace talks to go forward but dos 
santos is believed to be having trouble selling the pact to marxist 
hardliners in his government 
a sign of us support would strengthen dos santos position 
diplomats say 
cohens deputy warren clark would only say on arrival friday 
its inevitable well discuss bilateral relations with the 
angolans 
dos santos has donned the cloak of pragmatism tempering marxism 
in return for western aid to rebuild a warshattered economy 
bolstered by earnings of an angolanus oil consortium and soviet 
aid 
washington and pretoria have backed savimbis national union for 
the total independence of angola since portuguese colonizers 
abandoned the country to the warring factions in 1975 washington 
has no diplomatic relations with angola and currently gives the 
guerrillas 15 million a year in military aid 
in accords signed in new york on dec 22 angola cuba and south 
africa agreed to the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola 
in return for south africas granting independence to namibia and 
halting aid to savimbi 
washington and moscow which has backed angola since 1975 are 
observing a meeting of the commission monitoring the accords 
opening the commissions fourth twoday session friday angolan 
foreign minister pedro castro van dunem said members can 
congratulate ourselves particularly because of the political will 
demonstrated by all parties who have really backed the possibility 
of peace in our region 
col arvid geirulv deputy commander of the un angolan 
verifying mission said 13360 cuban troops left angola between jan 
10 and wednesday keeping the withdrawal on schedule 
cuban troops remaining in angola are to withdraw north of the 
15th parallel by aug 1 and be out of the country by mid1991 
i believe the meeting will be calm and productive and that 
well be able to find solutions to pending problems said neil van 
heerden secretarygeneral of south africas foreign ministry 
cuban deputy foreign minister ricardo alarcon de quesada is 
heading his countrys delegation and soviet deputy foreign minister 
anatoli adamishin was expected in luanda later friday 
observers say the commissions problems are manageable 
concerning isolated crossborder incidents and the return of 
namibian refugees from angola and zambia 
not so clearcut is the future of peace talks dos santos broke off 
last week in zaire saying they could not continue in a climate of 
war 
angolas official news agency reported friday that savimbis 
guerrillas killed six people in attacks on civilian vehicles in 
southwestern benguela province it said this brought the toll to 20 
people killed by the guerrillas since the ceasefire took effect 
dos santos has described the june 22 summit of african leaders in 
gbadolite zaire as hurried and it now appears several people 
including zambian president kenneth kaunda jumped the gun in 
reporting savimbi had agreed to go into temporary exile an angolan 
government precondition for negotiations 
savimbi who operates from bush headquarters in southeastern 
angola says he has no intention of going into exile

convicted heroin trafficker and reputed mobster 
gene gotti was sentenced friday to the maximum 50 years in prison by 
a judge who condemned his long involvement in ganglandtype 
activities and lawlessness 
gotti younger brother of john gotti the man law enforcers call 
the head of the gambino crime family and one of the nations most 
powerful criminals showed no reaction as us district judge john 
r bartels sentenced him 
codefendant john carneglia also was sentenced to 50 years and 
both men were fined 75000 
they were convicted may 23 of running a multimilliondollar 
heroin ring 
these are very serious crimes said bartels the government 
has proved these defendants are members of the gambino crime family 
and that their allegiance is placed above the laws of this country 
defense lawyers said they were shocked by the severity of the 
sentence but confident the conviction would be overturned on appeal 
gotti and carneglia will remain at the metropolitan correctional 
center at least until fall pending the outcome of their appeals 
gotti 42 of valley stream and carneglia 44 of new york 
would likely spend 25 years in jail before becoming eligible for 
parole said us attorney andrew j maloney 
authorities describe gotti as a gambino capo or captain and 
carneglia as a soldier in the family reputedly involved in 
loansharking extortion labor rackets gambling and drug dealing 
defense attorneys gerald shargel and ronald fischetti argued for 
lighter sentences saying their clients have wives and children and 
have been convicted of no crimes since their arrest on the drug 
charges in august 1983 
gotti and carneglia have been jailed since june 29 the day after 
bartels revoked bail because he found they had continued to deal 
drugs and associate with other mobsters after their conviction 
at the bail hearing an fbi agent testified that gotti helped his 
brother john plan the assassination of the former gambino boss paul 
castellano to escape a possible mob death sentence for dealing 
heroin 
john gotti took command of the gambino family after castellano 
and his bodyguard were shot dec 16 1985 outside a restaurant 
lawenforcement officials say 
under castellanos rules for his crime family trafficking in 
heroin was punishable by death the agent testified 
gene gotti and carneglia had remained free on 1 million bail 
each while the case made its way through the courts the case 
resulted in two mistrials and became one of the oldest cases on the 
federal docket

new yorks program to inoculate prison 
inmates against german measles involves a choice be vaccinated or 
isolated 
prison system spokesman james flateau who has characterized the 
program as voluntary for the past several days said friday that 
12 inmates at downstate prison have refused vaccinations and have 
been kept in isolation for about a week he said the dozen 
inmates would probably remain isolated several more days until 
doctors are sure they arent going to get measles 
flateau continued to describe the rubella inoculation program 
stemming from a german measles outbreak in new york citys rikers 
island jail complex as voluntary 
it is voluntary he said theres a medical problem out 
there and youve got to address the medical problem one way of 
addressing the medical problem is to receive the inoculation the 
other way of addressing it is for us to be sure if youre not 
inoculated that you havent been exposed 
flateau said the resulting quarantines were for medical 
purposes not punitive 
the prison system spokesman said that about 20 guards have also 
refused to be vaccinated he said they are being counseled and 
that if they continue to refuse vaccinations they will be required 
to sign a waiver indicating they have been informed of the risk they 
face having signed the waiver they will be allowed to continue to 
work because they really only present a danger to each other 
said flateau the rest of the staff and all the inmates except 
those who accepted isolation will have been vaccinated 
medical isolation according to flateau means prisoners are 
confined to quarters and cant participate in group activities 
meals are brought to the prisoner 
flateau said that about 5000 inmates and prison staff have thus 
far been inoculated at five prisons that health officials think 
might be at risk because they had accepted prisoners recently from 
the rikers island complex in all about 7000 doses of vaccine 
costing the state 16 per dose have been sent to the prisons said 
flateau 
the state has refused to accept inmates from the two affected 
sections of rikers since june 29 he said the state will begin 
taking prisoners again from those sections over the next few weeks

carlos menem becomes president 
saturday and plans to announce his economic program the next day so 
argentines soon will know whether his image of action translates 
into a bold assault 
in addition to laying out his policies on hyperinflation 
recession and the soaring deficit he has promised quick resolution 
of a problem that plagued president raul alfonsin army opposition 
to trying officers accused of violating human rights during the 
197683 military dictatorship 
menem is a chess player and he plays to win said manuel mora 
y araujo a sociologist and pollster he prepares the ground and 
then he advances 
menem surprised many by choosing three cabinet ministers from 
outside his peronist party and pledging to sell state companies that 
were nationalized or created in the 1940s and 1950s by the partys 
founder dictator juan peron 
adolfo perez esquivel a human rights activist who won the 1980 
nobel peace prize said he was impressed by menems attempt last 
month to oust saul ubaldini as generalsecretary of the general 
labor confederation 
the labor organization has been the backbone of the peronist 
party for four decades and held 13 general strikes during the 
fiveyear term of president alfonsin whom menem replaces 
menem said publicly that ubaldini wanted to leave the labor 
federation and had been offered a diplomatic post abroad ubaldini 
denied it and refused the job 
he tried to get rid of ubaldini thats very interesting 
perez esquivel said he is trying to increase his room to maneuver 
and part of that means getting rid of people who might be political 
opponents 
the new president elected may 14 faces economic problems that 
are immediate and enormous 
inflation in june alone exceeded 100 percent unemployment is 
about 10 percent the currency has lost 97 percent of its value 
since february and the deficit has grown to an estimated 12 percent 
of the 80 billion gross national product 
arrears of 45 billion in payments on the 60 billion foreign 
debt make it impossible to obtain new loans the central bank holds 
about 1 billion worth of gold but virtually no foreign currency 
real wages have shrunk by at least 40 percent since january 
shantytowns and malnutrition are spreading supermarkets in 
cordoba mendoza and rosario cities were looted this week in a minor 
replay of the food riots six weeks ago 
were starting from nothing menem said in an interview 
published sunday in el cronista comercial a financial daily 
were going to do major surgery he declared in reference to 
the telephone railway oil and other state companies that lose 
money and siphon off funds from the budget 
leaders of brazil peru paraguay panama and yugoslavia arrived 
friday for the ceremony daniel ortega of nicaragua and julio m 
sanguinetti of uruguay were expected later 
former secretary of state henry kissinger arrived as a special 
guest of menem the leader of the us delegation commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher arrived thursday 
menems economic plan centers on making state companies private 
to attract foreign capital voluntary price controls to curb 
inflation lowinterest business loans to maintain production and 
jobs incentives for farm production and exports and wage raises to 
increase consumer demand 
to reduce the deficit menem plans to cut subsidies enforce tax 
laws and raise utility rates unions oppose the sale of state 
companies for fear of mass layoffs businessmen oppose price 
controls and wage increases and workers are against higher utility 
rates 
with his conservative appointments and policies menem is turning 
away from the peronist party rank and file who elected him 
mora y araujo said he wants to do something that hasnt been 
done in argentina since the 1930s govern to the political right 
but with popular support 
alfonsin whose radical civic union party lost the may 14 
election tried many of the same measures and was blocked 
he also faced three rebellions by soldiers pressing the view that 
trials of officers for human rights abuses during the dictatorship 
must end menem is said to favor an amnesty which would anger human 
rights groups 
a commission appointed by alfonsin documented the cases of nearly 
9000 people who disappeared in 197683 and were presumed killed 
estimates by human rights organizations range up to 30000

deaths two men in a small plane were killed when they crashed while 
trying to land in pau 480 miles southwest of paris 
the storm knocked down power lines flooding factories and 
shredding corn and tomato crops as well as the precious grapes of 
the sauternes region 
many sauternes were damaged and some devastated at chateau 
dyquem which produces a prized sweet white desert wine proprietor 
alexandre lur saluces said half his 1989 production was wiped out 
normally chateau dyquem produces about 75000 bottles of wine 
from its 250 acres of vines in production a bottle of 1983 chateau 
dyquem considered a top vintage by connoisseurs sells for 150 to 
225 in paris 
more than 50 percent of the 1989 harvest has been wiped out 
and i have to say a part of the 1990 harvest seems to be in 
question said lur saluces whose family has owned chateau dyquem 
since 1786 
some other vineyards in the area lost up to 100 percent of their 
grapes for this year

caribbean stock exchange a caribbean court of appeals and an 
emergency fund for disaster relief

us and european markets

treasury secretary nicholas brady said 
friday leaders of the major industrialized nations are unlikely to 
shift economic direction at next weeks summit in paris 
we should bear in mind the economies of the world are doing 
very very well he told reporters in a satellite broadcast from 
washington 
i dont think anybodys talking about changing the throttle 
settings at this particular point in time he said 
president bush and the leaders of britain canada france italy 
japan and west germany will make their annual examination of their 
economies health 
brady said officials probably will reiterate the statement issued 
last spring by finance ministers saying an excessive rise or fall in 
the value of the dollar would be counterproductive 
he turned aside criticism that industrialized nations spring 
efforts to stem the sharp rise in the dollar against other major 
currencies had been futile 
i dont subscribe to the line of thought that says that either 
policy coordination or intervention is a thing of the past he 
said 
i would only point out that markets do have from time to time 
volatile periods he said we had one this spring 
he noted the dollars value had come down in recent weeks and 
currency markets were quiet i think the process is working very 
well he said 
central banks of leading industrialized nations mounted an 
expensive campaign last spring to drive down the value of the 
dollar they intervened heavily in the currency markets by selling 
dollars to try to change its value 
finance officials of the seven major industrial powers have 
pledged to work together to keep the dollar stable 
brady said there was no need to make the nations cooperation on 
exchange rates more formal as some european officials suggest 
we dont see any reason to change things in any material way 
and that would include a more rigid approach to exchange rates he 
said we think the market is doing its job and we would feel very 
uneasy about tinkering with success 
he also said the bush administration does not expect the us 
economy to slip into a recession but rather have a soft landing 
our economy has been going forward on an upward plane for the 
last seven years so if that plane changes its slope a little bit 
then that is what we think is a soft landing growth at slower 
rate he said 
there have been growing fears of recession in the united states 
analysts predicted the federal reserve likely will loosen its 
credit policy further in an effort to drive down consumer and 
business interest rates 
the federal reserve in march 1988 began a credittightening drive 
that lifted interest rates a move designed to dampen inflationary 
pressures by reducing demands for borrowing 
but the central bank in a major policy shift last month lowered 
a key interest rate and analysts believe it shortly will reduce 
that rate again

members of two ethnic groups fought gunbattles 
friday and tried to set buildings on fire in nagornokarabakh one 
of the countrys most volatile ethnic regions the official tass 
news agency said 
the news agency said armenians and azerbaijanis who have been 
feuding for 1 years shot at each other with hunting rifles in 
kirkijan a suburb of nagornokarabakhs principal city stepanakert 
a real likelihood of massive clashes between the armenian and 
azerbaijani populations was created tass said 
the shooting lasted several hours and was accompanied by attempts 
to set private and public buildings ablaze with signal rockets tass 
said the report said some people had fled the village and hid in a 
forest 
an armenian and azerbaijani were slightly wounded before police 
and interior ministry forces ended the clash tass said 
the dispatch also said hooligans were disrupting food supplies 
and telephone and telegraph service and staging demonstrations and 
sitins rumors are sweeping through nagornokarabakh that attacks 
on innocent residents are imminent according to tass 
since 1923 nagornokarabakh has been part of the republic of 
azerbaijan but armenians who make up threequarters of the 
regions 162000 inhabitants claim that azerbaijanis discriminate 
against them they want the region to be annexed to the neighboring 
republic of armenia 
the kremlin has refused and in january authorities in moscow 
placed nagornokarabakh under kremlin management 
strikes and demonstrations flared in the region and in armenia in 
february 1988 and continued sporadically throughout the year more 
than 90 people were killed in the unrest 
a general strike has been under way in the region since may 3 
and tass reported tuesday it has cost nagornokarabakh 535 million 
in wages 
tass said the latest disturbances appeared designed to disrupt a 
visit to nagornokarabakh by a commission of the national 
parliament the congress of peoples deputies 
the commission was formed last month to try to work out a 
compromise between armenians and azerbaijanis armenians have 
accused soviet authorities of trying to increase the number of 
azerbaijans in the district

moslem guerrillas said they stalled a 
government offensive friday after losing a strategic garrison on the 
outskirts of the eastern city of jalalabad 
the guerrillas blamed the loss of the samarkhiel garrison 
thursday on a shortage of weapons and manpower 
abdul kabir a rebel spokesman said afghan government troops 
plowed through guerrillaheld positions before being halted about 
seven miles east of jalalabad in eastern afghanistan 
we couldnt hold on said azim nasserzia whose guerrillas 
had held samarkhiel the mujahedeen didnt even have enough 
weapons for their own defence 
kabir agreed 
we have a problem with this we have only small weapons or ones 
that are not in good working condition 
nasserzia said the loss of samarkhiel which had been captured 
by the usbacked guerrillas early in march was a crushing blow 
the only victory since the russian withdrawal and we lose 
it he said 
the soviet army pulled the last of its troops from afghanistan in 
february ending a nineyear military involvement in the civil war 
the guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust afghanistans 
marxist government 
the insurgents who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors launched an attack on jalalabad in early march after a 
month of some of the bloodiest fighting in 10 years of war the 
offensive ended in a stalemate 
the battle for jalalabad destroyed predictions that the kabul 
government would collapse soon after the soviet troop withdrawal 
nasserzia also blamed the defeat on the interim guerrilla 
government saying it has drained many of the will to fight 
the government was formed with the idea it would replace the 
afghanistan government but it only has representatives from the 
guerrilla parties based in pakistan 
it does not include representation for guerrillas based in iran

the five basic duties of all moslems 
the saudi interior ministry said iranians were welcome as long as 
they did not try to politicize the proceedings saudi arabia severed 
ties with tehran last year citing its support for subversion 
more than 400 pilgrims most iranians died in 1987 when saudi 
troops quelled a riot in mecca 
last year saudi arabia imposed a quota of 1000 pilgrims per 1 
million population for all countries the usual iranian contingent 
of 150000 would have been cut to a third that and the iranians 
stayed away in protest

george bush former baseball coach took time 
out friday from preparing for his trip to communist europe to talk 
baseball with 4000 little leaguers 
in little league all that matters is the size of your heart and 
of your dreams he said to the kids 
they were gathered on the south lawn decked out in uniforms 
identifying them as indians mets springfield roccos rockettes 
and parkland blue jays 
the purpose was to mark the founding of little league 50 years 
ago in williamsport pa adding luster to the ceremony were such 
baseball greats as stan musial mike schmidt brooks robinson gary 
carter ted sizemore joe morgan and jim palmer 
the president confessed his baseball hero was lou gehrig and he 
recalled that when babe ruth presented his papers to yale the yalie 
who accepted them was none other than george bush 
to the young players bush repeated a line that babe ruth 
delivered to a crowd in yankee stadium when he was dying of cancer 
you know the only real game in the world i think is 
baseball youve got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7 
years old and if you try hard enough youre bound to come out on 
top 
with those words said the president ruth defined why little 
league baseball has become an american indeed an international 
institution 
my four boys played it i coached it and barbara not many 
non baseball players could properly score a baseball games but 
barbara did that inning after inning bush said 
like you i know what makes little league so special its a 
feeling of sportsmanship generosity teamwork a feeling of family 
fathers and daughters mothers and sons 
he said in the 50 years 20 million youngsters had played little 
league more than 25 million in 33 nations this year alone 
bush told the crowd that when he is in poland next week he will 
have the pleasure of helping import little league and he said he 
will tell about musial and carl yastrzemski both baseball greats of 
polish extraction 
in little league all that matters is the size of your heart and 
of your dreams and ask these kids about it bush said dreams 
are the essence of america and of baseball and little league can 
propel those dreams 
in the end what matters is how we conduct ourselves on as well 
as off the field thats where little league really connects by 
building courage and character it belts a grandslam home run by

a solidarity official on friday opposed 
any suggestions poland should give up land that was in german hands 
before world war ii 
those who question existing borders damage perspectives for 
stability in europe said bronislaw geremek leader of 
solidaritys deputies in the polish parliament 
he was responding to a suggestion by west german finance minister 
theodor waigel that germany should be reunified within its 1937 
borders that would include about a third of what is now poland 
geremek spoke to reporters after talks with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
the west german and polish governments are trying to reach 
agreement on a new financial aid package for poland and on improved 
conditions for polands ethnic german minority 
the talks are stalled over conditions for financial assistance 
the impasse forced kohl to call off a visit to poland he had 
tentatively planned this month 
geremek said he sees new chances for closer relations between 
germans and poles and that problems holding up the agreement 
are only of the second order 
relations were cooled further by waigels comment on sunday that 
germans still have a legal right to parts of eastern europe 
including large sections of poland that once belonged to germany 
the german empire did not cease with the capitulation of the 
german army on may 8 1945 waigel said in hanover 
polands communist party reacted angrily to waigels remarks and 
his comments drew negative responses from kohl and genscher 
genscher said in a radio interview friday that current frontier 
agreements are accepted by everybody and leave no room for 
discussion 
kohl said on west german television thursday night no one in 
poland must fear that we germans are revisionists 
in his talks with geremek and other solidarity leaders kohl said 
he considers closer ties with poland a special matter in view of 
the burden and tragedy of our common history said the 
chancellors spokesman hans klein 
the chancellor said he considers the situation is ripe now for 
a major step in creating friendly relations between the two 
countries klein told reporters 
geremek said solidarity agrees with the west german position that 
any new financial credit for poland must be linked to definite 
projects which was not the case with aid to poland in the 1970s 
he also said any new credit to poland should be based on 
successful economic reforms in his homeland 
poland does not want to be europes beggar he said 
we want to underscore that only a reformed economy is worthy of 
asking for support that would ensure not only that the credit would 
be paid back but also that countries that invest in poland can 
make a profit he said

officials of the environmental protection 
agency said friday they are optimistic that oileating 
microorganisms may soon become valuable tools in cleaning up the 
exxon oil spill in alaska 
epa administrator william reilly said preliminary findings from 
an experiment in which nutrients were used to enhance the growth of 
such organisms on small sections of alaskas contaminated beaches 
appear to show success 
in some cases the number of organisms multiplied 100fold only a 
week into the experiment and even in the early stages some beaches 
treated with nutrients showed a striking disappearance of the oil 
from rock surfaces the epa said 
reilly said that the results were potentially good news and 
that if the preliminary findings hold up exxon corp may begin later 
this summer to treat large sections of beach with nutrients to 
enhance oileating microorganism growth 
eric brathauer assistant administrator for research and 
development said it will be several weeks before some remaining 
questions about the experiment will be resolved 
the epa began using nutrients to enhance microrganism growth on 
six test plots along alaskas contaminated king island beaches june 
8 in hopes the growth would spur oil degredation some degredation 
has been observed in untreated areas but in many cases there are 
too few microorganisms to make a significant impact 
but brathauer said the nutrients acted as a fertilizer and 
brought about significant increases in levels of oileating 
organisms in the test areas he said so far there have been no signs 
of any side effects detrimental to the environment 
in addition to the rapid growth of the microorganisms in the test 
areas there has been a noticeable cleaning of rock surfaces that 
had not been anticipated so early said richard valentinetti an epa 
official involved in the project 
rock surfaces on which the nutrients were applied became much 
cleaner shortly after contact similar to soap releasing dirt from an 
object but the officials warned that the cleaning may have been a 
physical reaction and not biological 
valentinetti said in an interview that the agency hopes to learn 
more about the cleansing action within the next few weeks and 
determine whether it was a biological reaction he said it remains 
uncertain whether the oil that came off the rocks actually degraded 
or was simply transported 
the epa estimates that anywhere from 700 miles to 1200 miles of 
alaskan coastline much of it shear rock and boulders have been 
contaminated by the march 24 exxon valdez spill in prince william 
sound 
valentinetti said use of the oileating microorganisms is 
expected to be most productive along about 100 miles of shoreline 
where there is sand and sediment 
he said exxon has estimated it would cost about 5 million to 
treat 50 miles of beach with the nutrient fertilizer to enhance 
microorganism growth most areas likely would require more than one 
treatment officials suggested 
that cost would be only a small portion of the overall cleanup 
costs facing exxon

natos supreme commander in europe gen john 
galvin said friday that western tracking of the pilotless mig23 
that zoomed across west europe undetected by soviet radar proved the 
allied alert system works 
on another issue galvin reacted coolly to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs offer in strasbourg france thursday to make 
another unilateral cut in shortrange nuclear missiles 
the main thing threatening us is overwhelming soviet 
conventional forces galvin told a meeting of american reporters 
i question whether or not we are in a safer world in europe 
today than we were say 10 years ago 
on the runaway plane galvin said two us f15 fighters 
scrambled from a nato base in the netherlands as a policing 
action as it crossed into west europe tuesday they shadowed it 
hoping it would reach the north sea but it crashed in belgium 
killing a man 
galvin said he accepted moscows explanation that it was an 
accident 
the pilot ejected over poland after reporting the plane was 
smoking the soviets say their radar missed the mig23 as it flew on 
for 500 miles 
the incident recalled the failure of soviet air defenses to 
detect a small plane flown by german amateur pilot mathias rust who 
landed in red square 
mathias rust is one thing a little tiny plane flying at low 
altitudes said galvin but this plane took off from their own 
airfield and was flying at high altitude 
a soviet officer lt col anatoly s balikin said in moscow it 
was not practical or economical to monitor every plane 
galvin said us pilots did not shoot down the mig23 or move 
alongside and tip it over because it was over populated areas 
regarding gorbachevs offer he said that although the soviets 
had 1400 shortrange missiles launchers compared with north 
atlantic treaty organizations 88 moscows conventional superiority 
was a bigger threat 
if we get into the shorterrange nuclear forces too early were 
giving away the major motivating idea because the soviets do want to 
see us get rid of nuclear weapons said galvin they are not so 
anxious to get rid of conventional weapons 
last month gorbachev told us secretary of state james a baker 
iii he will withdraw 500 shortrange missiles unilaterally they 
have a range of up to 310 miles 
galvin said that despite the appeal of glasnost or openness he 
questioned whether europe was safer because of the risk of soviet 
instability 
i applaud the way the soviet union is moving said galvin 
but its a rocky road theyre heading down theyre saying they 
cant turn back but they dont know precisely where theyre going

the vaticans chief guardian of doctrine 
friday praised last weeks us supreme court ruling that allows 
states to restrict abortion 
the decision is a sign of the birth of a new moral 
consciousness on abortion roman catholic cardinal joseph 
ratzinger said at a news conference at madrid university 
it is a kind of move away from earlier attitudes where i see a 
reflection that weighs more on the side of the value of human 
life said the prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the 
faith which makes sure that church officials adhere to catholic 
doctrine 
ratzinger made the comments after delivering a lecture titled 
jesus christ today at a university seminar 
in its decision issued on july 3 the us supreme court voted 
54 to give the states broad powers to restrict the availability of 
abortions the ruling narrowed the courts 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
on another topic ratzinger denied a recent brazilian newspaper 
report that the church had decided to order new sanctions against 
the rev leonard boff of brazil a leading proponent of liberation 
theology 
in 1985 the vatican sentenced boff to nearly a year of 
obedient silence because of books he wrote that criticized the 
roman catholic church for not doing enough to aid the poor in the 
third world 
liberation theology stresses social activism by catholics on 
behalf of the oppressed pope john paul ii has objected to forms of 
liberation theology that embrace marxist theory 
ratzinger said the pope believes the theology to be useful and 
necessary at times but other aspects that present deviations 
motivated by politics are not very correct he said 
ratzinger also denied that the vatican had been more severe with 
liberal theologians than with ultraconservative church figures such 
as french archbishop marcel lefebvre who was excommunicated for 
challenging the popes authority

the government announced a stricter policy 
friday to deal with threats against aviation including a system 
that requires airlines to take countermeasures and imposes fines for 
disclosing security alerts 
a federal aviation administration order which will go into 
effect monday replaces the system of issuing security bulletins 
which was criticized after the bombing of pan am flight 103 over 
scotland last december that killed 270 people notices of threats 
against us airlines on the flights route were posted in at least 
one foreign embassy but not distributed to the general public 
under the new order individuals or airlines that disclose 
information from government security alerts without faa authorizaton 
will be fined up to 1000 for individuals and 10000 for 
airlines 
faa spokesman john leyden said the system for alerting airlines 
will now include two types of adivsories information circulars and 
security directives 
the information circulars will deal with general threats of 
hijackings bombings or other terrorist actions leyden said they 
are basically a headsup warning and would require no particular 
action he said 
the security directives however would require countermeasures 
by an airline such as additional baggage inspections leyden said 
these would be in response to specific threats against an airline 
an airport or an individual flight and might include such 
information as the threatened time and method of attack he said 
previously airlines were not required to take any specific 
actions in response to security bulletins 
the faa in a news release on the new order said airlines have 
been responsive to actions suggested in security bulletins but 
making compliance mandatory will strengthen security 
since 1986 the faa has issued 93 security bulletings about 
onethird of them warning of specific threats 
in the case of flight 103 an faa advisory had been issued about 
the threat of a bomb aboard a us airline flight from frankfurt 
germany to the united states the pan am flight originated in 
frankfurt with a different plane but us and european authorities 
said they concluded that the threat was not related to the bombing 
of flight 103 
other warnings were issued about the possibility of plastic 
explosives concealed in a radiocassette player investigators said 
that such a bomb caused the pan am explosion although they have not 
found who planted the device 
relatives of americans killed in the pan am bombing have called 
for public advisories whenever there is a threat against aviation 
saying passengers have a right to know when they are boarding an 
aircraft that has been threatened 
transportation secretary samuel skinner has rejected the 
suggestion saying it would disrupt aviation and compromise 
intelligence gathering 
on thursday the faa announced new rules requiring airlines to 
install units that can detect plastic explosives in checked luggage 
at 40 us and foreign airports it did not list the airports 
except for john f kennedy in new york and gatwick in london and 
said it would take two or three years before all the units are 
installed

serving food to the citys street people 
sandra loranger 49 of santa cruz who was charged with not 
having a permit to provide the food was given the jail term

miles south of san francisco 
i fully intend to keep on doing it said loranger who does 
not have to begin her jail term until next week she added she would 
stop her activities only if unconditional food is made available 
to the poor on a daily basis but not until 
she was sent to jail because she refused to accept probation 
under which she would be required to obey all laws 
loranger a partner in an antique store is the first of the 
activists working for the citys homeless population to receive a 
jail term for handing out food 
she was cited feb 21 during one of the meals the activists 
served at the town clock in downtown santa cruz 
the city began requiring the permits earlier this year because 
too many homeless persons were gathering in a busy section of town 
where the activists were serving them meals

the paris branch of the simon wiesenthal center has 
complained to michelin about its map of northeast africa that gives 
egypt and jordan a common border and omits israel 
what we have here at best is discrimination in order to 
satisfy the arab market and at worst a position taken that would 
seem to endorse the most extreme demands of those who would like to 
eliminate israel said shimon samuels european director of the 
wiesenthal center 
the los angelesbased center is an international organization 
whose goal is combating prejudice 
on june 14 samuels sent a letter to michelin president francois 
michelin asking that the map be withdrawn and reprinted 
at the very best we think this map is a blight on the 
reputation for geograhical accuracy of michelin guides and maps 
he said in a telephone interview from london 
the front cover of the map of africa north east arabia 
displays a small section of the full map the cutout omits israel 
and shows instead a dotted line frontier running between egypt and 
jordan which occupied the west bank from 1948 to 1967 
the full map avoids the issue by placing in the area where israel 
would be located a small inserted map of the entire african 
continent with the phone number for the michelin company 
a spokesman at michelins office here said the letter was 
received two days ago by the department responsible for cartography 
which intended to respond 
the spokesman who spoke anonymously in keeping with company 
policy said the response will be private and not given in the 
press 
he said the map of arabia had been drafted and in print since 
1967 
earlier this year the weisenthal centers paris office 
complained to air france after the national airline published a 
middle east tourist brochure with a map that omitted israel the 
brochure listed hotels in the middle east but contained no listings 
in israeli cities 
samuels said his office was talking to the airline about 
withdrawing or reediting the brochure

the bush administration is looking again for 
someone to head the health and human services department agency that 
handles the medicare and medicaid programs 
drew altman human services commissioner in new jersey and the 
second candidate who has been under serious consideration for 
nomination to head the health care financing administration 
withdrew his name friday 
altman who is taking a job in the private sector said his chief 
reason for pulling out was the length of time it takes to move 
through the personnel pipeline in washington 
however sources in washington and new jersey who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity said altmans candidacy had run into trouble 
at the white house over questions about his politics and an 
unbudgeted 21 million spending spree by one of his new jersey 
division heads 
altman 38 is a registered independent and did not participate 
in the republican presidents new jersey campaign last fall 
in april sheila burke chief of staff to senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan withdrew from contention for the hhs job because 
her husband is a vice president of the aetna insurance group aetna 
is one of several insurance companies under contract to the hhs 
agency to handle medicare claims at the time sources said an 
arrangement could not be worked out to avoid potential conflicts of 
interest 
altmans withdrawal appeared to mark the second time one of hhs 
secretary louis sullivans candidates for a top job at the 
department has withdrawn after running into opposition at the white 
house 
earlier robert fulton oklahoma social services secretary 
withdrew from consideration for nomination to head the departments 
welfare agency in the face of criticism from righttolife activists

a community panel reviewing police activities 
following januarys riots has called for an overhaul of police 
hiring practices and a permanent board to investigate citizen 
complaints against officers 
the overtown independent review panel also recommended thursday 
increasing the number of black officers in miami from 18 percent to 
21 percent and expanding the hours of a police substation in the 
citys overtown section the center of the threeday riot that left 
one dead 
blacks comprise about 21 percent of dade countys 185 million 
residents the bulk of whom live in miami hispanics make up 46 
percent of the countys population and whites 33 percent 
city manager cesar odio said he agreed with the general tone of 
the report to be discussed by city commissioners next week but 
police chief perry anderson criticized most of the panels 
suggestions as unnecessary 
he said internal police investigators do an adequate job 
following up citizens complaints and the 24hour operation of the 
substation is not needed even though the police shooting that 
triggered the riots occurred across the street from the station when 
it was closed 
three nights of looting and arson in miamis black neighborhoods 
were triggered by the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a 
hispanic police officer jan 16 
the whole incident was spontaneous said anderson the 
results would have been exactly the same if the ministation was 
open 
anderson also defended the equality of the departments hiring 
practices 
what we need to do is generate enough black recruits to go 
through the system he said 
the panel found that between 1974 and march 1989 46 percent of 
the black candidates failed to complete the fivemonth program at 
the southeast florida institute of criminal justice in miami 
the panel claims 37 percent of hispanic candidates and 17 percent 
of anglos dropped from the program during the same period 
jim stinchcomb director of the institute says the current 
attrition rate is only 3 percent to 4 percent for all applicants and 
the panels figures may reflect some problems during the 1970s 
stinchcomb said dropout rates declined after the institute 
revamped its firing range test and some academic exams in 1981 
the numbers the panel is throwing out is no reflection on the 
current situation he said

the democrats national chairman on friday 
accused the republicans of merely paying lip service to hispanics 
and pledged grassroots efforts to give spanishspeaking americans 
more political clout 
we democrats know that empowerment begins not with political 
tokenism at the top but with a commitment at the local level 
ronald h brown told the annual convention of the national league of 
united latin american citizens 
labor secretary elizabeth dole spoke to the group later 
emphasizing a pending jobs bill rather than politics 
mrs dole said her no 1 priority is to reduce minority youth 
unemployment and she asked the groups support for a bush 
administration bill that would refocus the governments jobtraining 
program 
she said minority youth unemployment is a staggering 324 
percent while the jobless rate for young hispanics averages 22 
percent the nations overall unemployment rate is 53 percent 
mrs dole said hispanic employment at the transportation 
department rose by 25 percent while she was secretary during the 
reagan administration and i intend to get the same results at the 
department of labor 
brown told the group earlier youll hear about president bush 
appointing lauro cavazos secretary of education he said you 
wont hear about the cuts in secretary cavazos budget or about 
republican support for english only education 
he said the democrats are committed absolutely committed to 
bilingual education and committed to defeating english only 
amendments no matter what state they appear in 
brown also said bush just said no when the 
democraticcontrolled house requested 81 million in additional 
funding this year for combating drugs brown took particular aim at 
bushs budget proposal for head start saying more than three out 
of four needy kids still wont get help 
thousands of children in east la are on the slow track before 
they get to mr escalantes classroom he said referring to jaime 
escalante the dynamic teacher who inspired the movie stand and 
deliver and has become a hero of the administration 
brown addressed the scandal in the department of housing and 
urban development as well saying when people in colonias 
shanty towns go without running water and plumbing while former 
interior secretary james watt makes 300000 for a few hours work 
as a housing consultant something is out of kilter 
in his speech and in remarks afterward brown repeatedly 
criticized the republicans as masters of a madison avenue approach 
to politics while he said the democrats are still close to the 
people 
but he also acknowledged the gop has made inroads with hispanic 
voters especially in florida and california 
addressing the fundamentals of building party strength brown 
said after the speech there is nothing more crucial than the 1990 
census for the democratic party and its efforts to reach 
minorities census data are used to draw congressional districts 
census officials say they could have missed as many as 35 
million blacks and hispanics in the 1980 census while we think 
its about twice that amount he said he said the party will 
make sure the census bureau knows they are watched 
brown also said the party needs to do more to register hispanic 
voters and he acknowledged that republicans have done a better job 
of winning the allegiance of resident aliens in california by 
courting them in the years before they become citizens 
about 60 percent of eligible hispanics have not registered to 
vote he said the census bureau estimated the hispanic population 
at 175 million in 1985 
mrs dole talking about jobs for minorities said she and bush 
crafted legislation that redirects the job training partnership act 
from merely a training for a job program to one that will 
provide skills training literacy and remedial education and 
counseling 
each individual in the program will be assessed for his or her 
particular needs and goals will be set to meet those needs in 
short a total support system will be available funding will depend 
not on how many kids are trained and pushed into jobs slots but on 
achievement and longer term evaluation there will be followup 
after six months on the job and a year later to determine 
progress 
mrs dole urged members of the group billed as the largest and 
oldest hispanic organization in the united states to attend a 
senate subcommittee markup of the bill next wednesday

veterans officials were unable to prove they 
had checked the licenses of more than half the doctors they hired 
from 1986 to 1988 according to a published report friday 
according to a draft of a general accounting office study 
obtained by the washington post officials in the department of 
veterans affairs have failed to verify credentials for doctors and 
medical residents at the nations 172 va hospitals 
by not following applicable procedures va medical centers 
could unknowingly hire problem physicians andor be allowing 
physicians with sanctions against their licenses to treat 
veterans the post quoted the report as saying 
the va declining direct comment on the report issued a 
statement friday saying 
secretary edward j derwinski views gao studies as an 
effective independent management guide aiming for better quality 
care for veterans gao is concurrently conducting major management 
studies at va at derwinskis request va and congress are partners 
in seeking and delivering quality care for vets 
the vietnam veterans of america said the gao report and an 
earlier report on mortality rates at va hospitals show that veterans 
with serviceconnected disabilities should be allowed to seek health 
care from the provider of their choice 
if the government is unable to provide acceptable health care 
through the veterans hospital system then these veterans should 
have the right to seek medical treatment elsewhere said mary r 
stout president of the 35000member group 
va spokeswoman donna st john said the group is making a false 
comparison 
any attempt to connect the mortality review or the gao report 
with the quality of care is totally inappropriate she said 
explaining that mortality rates fail to reflect the condition of the 
patients who enter a particular hospital hospices for example 
have reported 100 percent rates 
she noted that the gao report according to the post said the 
conditions cited do not mean that the medical services provided by 
the va are substandard or that va physicians are incompetent 
the gao study was requested two years ago by sen frank 
murkowski ralaska ranking minority member of the senate veterans 
affairs committee his staff said it could not release a copy of the 
report because it was in draft form the va said it could not 
release the draft report either 
the full report with va comment is due for release in august 
murkowski wrote a 1985 law telling the va to act on those 
problems after the american medical association found 87 doctors 
were working for the agency even though their licenses had been 
revoked suspended or restricted 
va officials said they could prove they had checked the licenses 
of only 105 of the 207 physicians hired from 1986 to 1988 the 
report said the report also said the va had not fulfilled promises 
to ensure that its doctors are qualified to practice their 
particular specialties 
a further problem was detected with medical residents who work at 
va hospitals according to the draft report 
the government watchdog agency said a records check with the fbi 
found that 165 of the 16756 residents had been charged with 
criminal offenses between the early 1970s and may 1987 the post 
reported 
among the more serious offenses were 68 charged with drunken 
driving and 67 charged with drug violations five with vandalism and 
five with burglary the records did not indicate how many charges 
led to convictions

a millionaire who handed out 10000 checks 
on the senate floor while legislation that interested him was 
pending said the checks were political contributions not an attempt 
to bribe lawmakers 
it would be difficult to make it into a bribery case said 
travis county district attorney ronnie earle who believes its time 
to change texas loose campaign finance laws in texas its 
almost impossible to bribe a public official as long as you report 
it 
the 10000 personal checks with the payees name left blank 
were offered by lonnie bo pilgrim an east texas chicken 
processor to nine of the 31 senators two days before fridays vote 
on a house workers compensation bill 
business interests have favored the house plan but senators 
rejected it 
pilgrim said he was concerned about the high cost of workers 
compensation in texas and that he would like a law that would be a 
winwin situation for all of us 
the common practice of mine is to give large contributions to 
people preachers educational institutions and politicians and 
10000 or 100000 is a common practice with me pilgrim said 
its primarily just for the name identification with the 
politicians they will answer your calls and give you an 
appointment and listen to you describe an issue it does not infer a 
bribe pilgrim said 
most lawmakers said they returned the checks or planned to but 
sen oh ike harris said he saw nothing wrong with accepting 
the money 
blank payee lines like those on pilgrims checks are common 
because many people dont know the formal name of a politicians 
campaign committee harris said 
ive received campaign contributions that size before if the 
principles wrong it dont matter if its a dollar or a million 
right everybodys got a different style harris said 
texas law does not limit campaign contributions although 
officeholders are barred from raising money during regular 
legislative sessions there is no such prohibition on special 
sessions and the texas senate has been in special session for three 
weeks 
i think its outrageous it offends the integrity of the whole 
process said earle 
it looks horrible said sen kent caperton 
when i first heard it i thought they were joking its just so 
outrageous the law needs to be changed said caperton we need 
more limits about when we can take money and how much 
rep david hudson said he was introducing a bill to prohibit 
campaign contributions on the capitol grounds 
such overt attempts to influence the way laws are made should 
be stopped hudson said

mikhail s gorbachev told the other 
soviet bloc leaders friday they are free to pursue their own views 
of communism but suggested his own program of economic and social 
reform as a guide 
each country and each party has its own specifics and can 
continue its own individual road to socialist democracy and 
progress he said in a dinner toast after the first day of a 
warsaw pact summit 
his host at the banquet was president nicolae ceausescu of 
romania the most vocal critic of gorbachevs reforms 
the alliances seven members are divided over the new policies 
with the soviet union hungary and poland on the liberal side and 
bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany and romania sticking to the 
orthodox course 
their purposes at this summit are to discuss western 
armsreduction proposals and the warsaw pacts role in a new world 
where gorbachev speaks of a common european home with no threat 
or fear of war 
in his dinner toast the soviet president said we took new 
steps today toward european security rapprochement and eastwest 
dialogue he also condemned unspecified forces that want 
military confrontation 
ceausescu renewed what he described as the soviet blocs appeal 
to nato to give up its policy of nuclear deterrence 
neither he nor gorbachev mentioned what was decided friday 
reporters were barred from the conference itself but were 
admitted to the banquet hall in the former royal palace long enough 
to hear the brief dinner toasts 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov told an 
earlier news briefing gorbachev and his colleagues discussed nato 
proposals for reducing conventional forces and how the soviet bloc 
should change adapt become contemporary 
everybody would agree there are vast changes in our country 
in the world gerasimov said they are talking about the role of 
the warsaw pact in these changing conditions 
gerasimov was evasive about whether the topics at the twoday 
summit would include political divisions within the bloc 
ion diaconu of the romanian foreign ministry refused comment on a 
report by the soviet news agency novosti that the leaders were 
discussing creation of a warsaw pact political commission to 
arbitrate disputes between members 
diaconu denied reports that romania had requested a discussion at 
the summit of its feud with hungary over romanias alleged 
mistreatment of its 17 million ethnic hungarians 
gerasimov said disputes within the bloc were not on the agenda 
but each delegation can say a few words about its own problems 
he said gorbachev and other leaders addressed the meeting friday 
but gave no details of the deliberations 
reporters were admitted to the palace for a few minutes while 
ceausescu greeted his guests 
gorbachev said in west germany last month that the bucharest 
summit would respond to president bushs proposal may 29 for a joint 
reduction in us and soviet troops stationed in europe to 275000 
for each side by 1993 accompanied by cuts in combat aircraft and 
other conventional weapons 
the soviet leader said the bush proposal which will not be on 
the table until september had increased chances for quick agreement 
at vienna negotiations on conventional forces 
he also is pushing for talks with nato on reducing tactical or 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe but the united states wants 
the issue tied to cuts in conventional forces 
west germany where most of natos battlefield nuclear weapons 
are stationed favors talks the disagreement between the two allies 
subsided after bush made his conventional disarmament offer and said 
it could be agreed within a year 
on thursday during a visit to france gorbachev again tried to 
push the western alliance into talks on the shortrange weapons 
offering the possibility of more unilateral cuts in the kremlins 
nuclear arsenal if nato agreed 
his last offer to scrap nuclear weapons about 500 warheads 
came in may during a visit to moscow by secretary of state james a 
baker iii while nato was arguing about shortrange missiles 
there was unconfirmed speculation in bucharest that documents 
released after the summit ends saturday might include numbers for 
the strasbourg offer 
presidents communist party chiefs premiers defense and foreign 
ministers and other ranking offiials from the seven warsaw pact 
nations are attending the summit 
romanian television broadcast scenes of delegations arriving on 
thursday rezsoe nyers the hungarian party chairman appeared to be 
the only delegation head ceausescu did not greet with a comradely 
kiss on the cheek 
after gorbachev arrived reporters asked him what he expected of 
the summit 
ill tell you when weve finished he said

the house of lords britains top court ruled on thursday that 
inside intelligence by anthony cavendish could be published 
because the government had acknowledged the book was not a threat to 
national security 
the government barred distribution in britain of last decembers 
issue of the american magazine harpers which carried excerpts 
it was the second major defeat for prime minister margaret 
thatchers attempts to gag former intelligence agents 
last october the fivejudge court rejected a long and costly 
attempt through british and foreign courts to ban publication of 
spy catcher the memoirs of another exagent peter wright 
two scottish newspapers and scottish television which fought the 
cavendish case hailed the judgment as a victory over what critics 
call excessive secretiveness by the thatcher government 
it was an overweening use of government authority said 
arnold kemp editor of the glasgow herald 
the government resorted to the tactics of the bully to try to 
intimidate the press he said 
the thatcher government says it is seeking to hold exagents to a 
vow of lifelong silence 
harpers publisher john macarthur had threatened to fight the 
magazine case in the european court of human rights but cavendish 
a 62yearold merchant banker said he had not given harpers 
permission to publish the excerpts 
cavendish an agent from 194853 in britains foreign 
intelligence operation described spying in east bloc countries 
he also claimed that harold wilson resigned abruptly as british 
labor party prime minister in 1976 because the soviet kgb had 
embarrassing information about him 
in december 1987 cavendish defying government instructions not 
to publish the book had 500 copies printed at this own expense and 
sent them to friends as christmas cards a scottish legislator 
passed the book on to a newspaper the scotsman

the vast majority of assault weapons barred 
from importation since spring will be banned permanently from this 
country the government announced friday 
the ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons including 
the popular chinesemade ak47 and israelimade uzi carbine 
followed a fourmonth study by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the gun 
control act of 1968 which barred importation of weapons that are 
not used for legitimate sporting purposes 
the study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in 
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of 
their use in violent crime said stephen e higgins director of 
the atf bureau 
while the 43 were banned permanently another seven whose imports 
had been suspended since early spring will be available for import 
again as a result of the study those include six 22 rimfire 
caliber rifles and a gun called the valmet hunter which had been 
considered an ak47 type of weapon during the suspension 
higgins said the atf which studied the marketing and use of the 
weapons said the models banned were not being used for sporting 
uses such weapons were identified officially friday as 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
the atf annually traces 35000 to 40000 guns used in crime and 
about 10 percent of them are semiautomatic assault weapons higgins 
said estimating that slightly more than half of them were domestic 
makes that are not subject to atf control 
were not saying that it will solve the basic problem of 
crime higgins said adding their use in crime is probably 
disproportionately high compared with the number that are here 
holding aloft one of the banned weapons an israelimade galil 
rifle higgins pointed out some of the accoutrements that led to 
its prohibition a folding stock a night sight a flash suppressor 
on the end that could serve as a grenade launcher its ability to 
accept a bayonet lug a pistol grip and a large magazine 
in the future he said weapons with several of these features 
probably also would be subject to an import ban 
higgins estimated that the customs service has seized about 
20000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into the 
country unless purchased by law enforcement agencies asked whether 
the government will pay damages to importers higgins said thats 
something the court would decide 
three importers already have brought suit against the government 
over the suspension and although a district court has upheld the 
government in one of the cases higgins said the atf would accept 
comments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days the 
final regulations would be issued very quickly after that he 
said 
asked why the atf previously had allowed imports of the 
nowbanned weapons higgins said the committee set up after the 1968 
law was passed to determine whether guns qualified for import had 
concentrated primarily almost exclusive on handguns it wasnt 
until the number of assaultstyle weapons being imported increased 
dramatically that the atf focused on them he said 
the action friday was lauded by gun control advocates but wayne 
lapierre executive director of the nra institute for legislative 
action said it was inconsistent with the rights guaranteed 
lawabiding american gun owners under the second amendment to the 
constitution the national rifle association will fight this 
decision in the courts on capitol hill and at the ballot box 
john m snyder spokesman for the citizens committee for the 
right to keep and bear arms said the ban shows the 
undependability of government because originally the atf had 
certified that these rifles could be imported because they are 
suitable for sporting purposes 
i think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibility 
president bush has left with the firearmsowning community in the 
united states he added 
bush a hunter and a lifetime member of the national rifle 
association came into office opposing any bans on the assaultstyle 
weapons despite an outcry over their increasing popularity among 
drug gangs and a heightened public concern triggered by the january 
schoolyard slayings of five children in stockton calif by a man 
wielding an ak47 
however bush asked william j bennett the director of the 
office of national drug control policy to advise him on what to do 
about the weapons in march at bennetts urging treasury secretary 
nicholas brady suspended the imports of many of the weapons and 
bush expanded the list the following month 
the atf which has the power to control imports does not 
regulate domestic manufacture of weapons so similar weapons made in 
the united states would not be affected by the action several bills 
pending in congress would control or eliminate many of the usmade 
assaultstyle weapons 
the atf has estimated that domestic makes account for 
threequarters of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned by 
americans colt industries inc suspended sales of its ar15 the 
most popular of the domestic assault semiautomatic rifles in march 
sarah brady chairwoman of handgun control inc praised the 
atfs action as bushs leadership in working toward reducing 
assault weapon violence by stopping the import of these weapons of 
war 
i urge the president and the congress to continue in the 
direction of public safety by passing legislation to stop the 
domestic production of assault weapons said mrs brady whose 
husband former white house press secretary jim brady was severely 
wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on president reagan it 
is no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killing 
machines wearing a made in the usa label than by those made 
abroad 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio and rep pete stark dcalif 
who have authored bills that would severely limit or end future 
sales of domestically produced semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons 
as well as imports echoed mrs bradys views 
the presidents ban on imported assault weapons cannot make our 
streets safer unless we also ban americanmade assault weapons 
said metzenbaum the senator said some domestic makes also are 
favored by drug dealers and street gangs and are used against police 
officers and innocent citizens 
said stark the presidents decision to ban imported assault 
weapons while ignoring domestic ones is a glaring loophole 
the nra has argued vociferously against limits on the rights of 
lawabiding citizens to own the weapons and has urged a crackdown on 
criminals rather than imposition of new guncontrol laws 
the weapons banned come primarily from china israel west 
germany and belgium others are made in austria australia italy 
and switzerland among other countries

the government said friday one soldier 
has been arrested and two are being sought in a widely publicized 
human rights case involving the killing of leftist reynaldo 
francisco 
the announcement by j antonio carpio director of the national 
bureau of investigation was seen as an apparent bid to defuse 
criticism of president corazon aquinos civil liberties record 
during her visit to europe 
she leaves on saturday for west germany france and belgium 
carpio said constable 2nd class dioscoro ambagay jr was arrested 
and warrants were issued for sgt arnel jocson and constable 1st 
class ramon clavo in the march 1988 slaying of francisco and an 
attempt on the life of his companion hilario bustamente 
bustamante was found near death on march 21 1988 with deep stab 
wounds and cuts across his body 
he told authorities he and francisco were abducted on a manila 
street three days earlier while putting up posters protesting us 
bases in the philippines he said they were taken to the 
headquarters of mrs aquinos security force tortured and then 
driven to a remote area where francisco was slain 
bustamente left for the netherlands last april to address a human 
rights conference and has remained there 
carpio now wants him to return here to identify the suspects so 
they can be charged in court 
in a memorandum carpio noted that the case is one of the human 
rights cases exploited abroad by the cppndf propaganda referring 
to the communist party of the philippines and its ally the national 
democratic front 
in iligan city 500 miles southeast of manila assailants on 
friday shot to death capt nick enterina a provincial police chief 
and police sgt rogato garido as they chatted on the street near the

several louisiana prosecutors are eager to 
resurrect the states old law banning abortions in light of the 
us supreme courts upholding missouris restrictions on the 
operation 
i firmly believe that abortion is homicide and killing of an 
unborn fetus if a crime has been committed we will enforce the law 
as written here in rapides parish district attorney charles f 
wagner said friday 
the statutes still on our books we intend to use that as a 
vehicle to get back in court said harry connick district 
attorney in orleans parish 
the state house in a resolution approved 8113 asked 
prosecutors thursday to enforce whatever pre1973 abortion laws they 
consider constitutional 
the senate rewrote the resolution friday to call for enforcement 
of a more recent law similar to the missouri law that forbids use of 
state money workers or facilities for abortions 
federal courts ordered louisiana in 1976 not to enforce its 
abortion law which carried a penalty of up to 10 years in prison 
however it never was ruled unconstitutional said john s baker 
jr a professor at louisiana state university law center 
wagner and other prosecutors said they would have to review 
mondays decision before deciding whether to use louisiana laws 
suspended after the 1973 roe vs wade decision that gave women a 
right to abortions 
some prosecutors were flatly dubious 
i dont think the us supreme court has abrogated wade said 
nathan stansbury of lafayette i dont think our general statute 
that says all abortions are prohibited is renewed by the missouri 
decision 
baker who argued the case as an assistant district attorney for 
orleans parish said he and connick have talked about bringing it 
back into federal district court but have not made a final decision 
i told mr connick that there seemed to be an invitation in 
mondays ruling to raise the issue and that this case might be a 
vehicle for doing so baker said 
baker said they probably will decide soon whether to ask the 
federal court to reconsider the case that prohibited abortion in 
louisiana 
jefferson parish district attorney john mamoulides said his staff 
was drawing up a memo for the sheriffs office outlining which 
parts of the old law might legally be enforced

three f16 jet engines that 
mysteriously disappeared from hill air force base earlier this week 
were found friday but their return was as murky as their 
leavetaking 
the 3200pound engines valued at about 2 million apiece were 
recovered by the fbi but the bureau isnt talking the engines 
are in the possession of the government said hill spokesman len 
barry 
we cannot discuss any details of the theft or recovery of those 
engines because the matter is still under investigation by the fbi 
and the air force office of special investigation barry said 
fbi special agent tim screen confirmed the engines had been 
located but refused to provide further details 
retired rear adm gene r la rocque director of the center for 
defense information a military think tank in washington said he 
knew of engine parts being stolen in the past 
but whole jet engines that just boggles my mind he said 
friday id think it would be easier to steal a whole plane 
la rocque said millions of dollars have been lost through 
military employees stealing parts to sell including many for a 
lucrative black market in spares for the f14 fighter 
the engines are rebuilt pratt amp whitney f100 tw200 series about 
17 feet long 34 inches in diameter and weighing 3200 pounds each 
earlier hill spokeswoman maj portia mccracken said 
investigators had determined the engines were apparently taken off 
the base sometime between noon saturday and noon monday 
she did not know if the engines belonged to hill or if they had 
been sent from another base to be serviced nothing like this has 
ever happened in my memory i would say that it is very unusual 
mccracken said 
the engines were discovered missing by maintenance crews 
returning to work wednesday after the independence day holiday 
hill officials said the engines would have had to exit one of 
three gates on the base that are manned 24 hours a day with security 
guards 
the f16 is flown by pilots of the air forces 388th tactical 
fighter wing and the utah air national guards 419th tactical 
fighter wing both based at hill

politicians will face military tribunals on charges of corruption

will be formed soon for the trials 
i will only be gentle to an honest man elbashir said in an 
interview with the british broadcasting corp and the us 
governmentfunded voice of america the associated press was given 
access to the tape

islamic laws he said indicating they will face tough trials 
elmahdi escaped immediately after elbashirs coup on june 30 
but was arrested in a khartoum suburb on thursday 
sudans islamic laws passed in 1983 caused an outrcry in the 
west because of punishments that include cutting off limbs for 
theft death by stoning for women who commit adultery and lashing

the laws currently suspended are one of the main complaints of 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which has been fighting 
for six years for greater autonomy and political economic and 
administrative reforms 
elbashir has pledged to hold a national referendum on the laws 
if planned peace talks with the rebels in the ethiopian capital

disbanding sudans 36 political parties was among elbashirs 
first decrees after the coup and he said friday the decision was 
final 
he accused political parties of being the cause of sudans 
problems and said he would find another way for the nations people 
to participate in government 
i dont think sudan is ready for democracy with multiple

an estimated 1600 people are attacked annually at 
automated teller machines nationwide and the nearfatal shooting of 
a woman forced to withdraw 400 proves atm customers need more 
protection an alderman said 
alderman edward burke introduced a plan thursday that would shut 
down atms between midnight and 6 am it also would require a 
yearly 200 city license and safety inspections of atm locations by 
police 
we can no longer wait to take action to make these areas safer 
for the residents of chicago burke said 
burke said his restrictions might have prevented the assault on 
dana feitler 24 who was accosted near her apartment on june 18 
forced to withdraw 400 from a cash machine and then was shot in the 
head 
she remains hospitalized in a coma 
i see these machines that hand out cash to people standing on 
the street at any time of day or night and i know that they are 
inviting crime said police superintendent leroy martin who is 
backing burkes plan 
clinton krislov a lawyer who filed a classaction lawsuit on 
behalf of bank customers following the feitler shooting has called 
for atm safeguards including more drivethrough terminals to let 
customers stay in their cars and secret panic numbers to alert 
police to a problem 
banks have security to protect machines from the customers 
he said but they dont have adequate security for those customers 
in ms feitlers case a camera at the atm where she was robbed 
took a picture only of her but not her assailants police have said 
david taylor an executive with the bank administration 
institute a professional organization said friday the machines are 
safe but people must use common sense 
it takes an extra measure of thoughtfulness and care on the 
part of people using the machines at night and in remote areas he 
said 
bank customers interviewed friday said theyd feel shortchanged 
if atm use was restricted 
the fact that you can come and get your money anytime day or 
night thats the whole point of having these automatic tellers 
said chris wells 
they are a security problem said steve petran an office 
worker i can see where youre asking for trouble but you have to 
be aware that thats life in the city 
hearings on the proposed ordinance are scheduled july 18 before 
the councils finance committee which burke chairs

chinas industrial production grew much more 
slowly in the first half of 1989 than in 1988 according to figures 
released friday but the government seemed unsure whether that was 
good or not 
from an economic standpoint the news was good china has been 
trying since last fall to slow what it called overheated industrial 
growth that was fueling inflation and shortages 
but since quelling nationwide prodemocracy protests last month 
the government has sought for political reasons to show that 
factories are operating normally and production is climbing news 
media have been filled with reports of improved production 
nationwide 
total industrial output from january through june was 1729 
billion up 108 percent over the same period last year the 
official xinhua news agency said quoting the state statistics 
bureau 
by comparison industrial output in the first half of 1988 grew 
172 percent over the same period one year earlier this year the 
government set target of gradually declining growth rates beginning 
with below 16 percent in the first quarter and below 13 percent in 
the second the goal for the year is a 10 increase in production 
over 1988 
xinhua might well have reported that the nation overfulfilled its 
target for controlling toorapid growth 
instead it focused on industrial productions having grown 
steadily another xinhua dispatch said shanghai chinas leading 
industrial city topped its production quota for the first half of 
the year 
the news agency said shanghais industrial output was 139 
billion up 9 percent from last year 
it said the growth was achieved in the face of shortages of 
energy funds and raw materials during the turmoil which lasted 
nearly two months in the city

adm william j crowe retiring head of the 
joint chiefs of staff said friday that his historic 11day visit to 
the soviet union revealed the superpowers are entering a period of 
uneasy transition that does not make me feel comfortable 
crowe in a speech before the national press club said he hopes 
the two military giants are moving toward a new era in the 
superpower relationship but to conclude that we are already there 
would be a serious mistake 
the 64yearold admiral speaking a day after president bush 
rejected a new call from soviet president mikhail gorbachev for 
talks to eliminate shortrange nuclear missiles in europe said he 
believes united states should avoid dramatic counterresponses 
to kremlin initiatives at this point 
crowe met for more than an hour with gorbachev two weeks ago in 
moscow during his precedentsetting tour of oncesecret soviet 
military installations and visits with soviet military officers 
it was the first formal visit of a joint chiefs chairman to the 
soviet union and was the latest in a series of highlevel visits 
designed to dispel distrust between the superpowers last july 
crowe hosted marshal sergei f akhromeyev then the soviet chief of 
staff on a us visit 
there is little question in my mind that real change is afoot 
in the soviet union crowe said adding that he believed that 
gorbachev and his supporters were committed to fundamental 
reform 
crowe said that while there are encouraging signs that 
gorbachevs reforms and promised military cutbacks may help move 
away from the confrontational legacy of the postwar era the soviet 
changes have yet to be translated into reality 
our systems remain fundamentally competitive he said 
the soviets still retain the worlds largest military force and 
have made no major changes in their space air defense or strategic 
weapons he said 
the admiral lauded the soviet military officers he met as 
disciplined welltrained and motivated and found their 
equipment to be impressive and capable in the field 
he termed political and social changes the soviets have initiated 
as immense and risky 
crowe said he believed the soviets dont always understand the 
united states and dont appreciate why we dont respond 
moveformove and sometimes interpret this phenomenon as 
threatening to them 
all of this does not give me a warm fuzzy feeling nor make me 
comfortable crowe said what can be said is that we are 
entering a period of uneasy transition and hopefully we are moving 
toward a new era in the superpower relationship 
the admiral said the soviets are attempting to shed their 
past and dont appreciate why our historical realtionship still 
weighs heavily in our decisions 
therefore crowe argued the two superpowers may be in this 
unsettled state for a long period of time 
my deepest concern is that our own impatience doesnt force us 
to move too far before we understand where the world is headed 
crowe said the united states must move gradually and deliberately 
in reasonable steps as the horizon becomes clearer not before 
he added 
the military chief announced on sunday that he will retire on 
sept 30 at the end of his second twoyear term as chairman

americans took out 36 billion more in 
consumer debt than they retired in may as the pace of borrowing 
turned upward again the government reported friday 
the federal reserve board said consumer credit in may rose at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 62 percent up from the 43 
percent pace of the previous month still it was a smaller rise 
than increases of 66 percent in march and 95 percent in february 
consumer credit had increased 85 percent over all of 1988 
consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of the 
economys health since it represents twothirds of overall economic 
activity 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc in 
lexington mass said the report suggests consumer confidence 
consumers are still adding to their debt she said when 
they really get worried they retrench and start paying down 
interest rates she said do not have as much influence on 
consumer credit as with other types of loans 
revolving credit rates hardly move at all and auto rates only 
a percent or so she said this type of consumer is more 
concerned with the amount of the monthly payments not the amount of 
interest 
until the spring interest rates had been rising as the fed 
tightened its grip on credit in its attempt to stem inflation since 
early last month however the central bank has loosened its grip and 
interest rates have declined somewhat 
leading the overall consumer credit increase in may was the 
category of debt that includes credit cards it rose 194 billion 
a 126 percent annual rate of growth after a 109 percent increase 
in april 
auto loans were up 102 billion may a 42 percent increase on 
an annual basis compared to a 28 percent rise in april the fed 
reported auto loans had gone up only 03 percent in march 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased 
by 659 million in may a 4 percent annual rate of advance up from 
2 percent in april 
borrowing for mobile homes fell for the fourth consecutive month 
declining by 15 million at an annual rate of 07 percent that 
followed drops of 87 percent in april and 842 percent in march 
the steep march drop occurred largely becasue of a shift in debt 
from the mobile home category into that of bank loans 
the various changes left total consumer debt in may at a 
seasonally adjusted 69726 billion

president daniel arap moi said friday that 
police have raided 27500 illegal breweries in the month since he 
banned the brewing and drinking of traditional alcoholic beverages 
moi announced the figure while addressing an agricultural show in 
western kenya 
moi a teetotaler banned kenyas traditional drink changaa on 
june 10 and said at the time that he was not prepared to lead a 
drunken nation

the department of agriculture will purchase 15 
million worth of apples in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus 
created when consumers stopped buying amid fears over use of the 
chemical alar the department said friday 
the industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of 
apples from last years crop valued at between 40 million and 56 
million remain unsold 
the department said apple stocks were 53 percent greater on may 
31 than the average for that date for the previous three years and 
prices to growers had fallen by 3 to 4 per carton from what they 
were a year ago 
the top grade of red apples produced in washington state were 
recently selling for between 750 and 8 per box about 2 below 
the cost of production the nations 20000 apple growers have 
estimated losses at well over 100 million in sales 
alar is used to enchance red color to ease harvesting by 
delaying ripening so that most apples ripen together and to lengthen 
shelf and storage life the chemical penetrates throughout the fruit 
tissue and cannot be washed off like many pesticides 
the alar controversy began in late february when a private 
environmental advocacy group the natural resources defense council 
said apples treated with the chemical substantially increase the 
risk of cancer in children 
in cooperation with the department the industry will release 
apples to schools prisons food aid programs and others 
by removing these apples from normal channels of trade the 
apple market will be helped immediately and stocks should be cleared 
out before the beginning of the 1989 season said a department 
statement attributed to kenneth j clayton acting administrator of 
the departments agricultureal marketing service 
this is a major purchase said republican rep sid morrison 
whose central washington district produces roughly half of the 
nations apples 
morrison said the alar scare has been a form of nutritional 
terrorism that has unfairly dropped an economic bombshell on apple 
growers 
though the environmental protection agency and the food and drug 
administration disputed the environmental groups report as a major 
exaggeration of the risk sales fell immediately supermarkets began 
frequent posting of signs proclaiming their apples as alarfree and 
reducing prices on the red delicious variety on which alar 
frequently had been used 
even though epa criticized the natural resources defense council 
report the agency plans to ban use of alar and the manufacturer has 
withdrawn it from the us market

the nations unemployment rate climbed slightly 
to 53 percent last month as continued declines in manufacturing and 
construction slowed overall job growth the government said friday 
in providing fresh evidence of a slowing economy 
analysts were split on whether the jobless data provided by the 
labor department suggested a recession was nearing but they were 
unanimous in saying there was nothing in the report to change the 
federal reserves apparent decision to ease monetary policy 
the fed has apparently shifted gears now and it views the risk 
of a recession as more pronounced than the risk of inflation 
merrill lynch analyst bruce steinberg said 
wall streets initial reaction was indifferent but a broad 
advance came later as analysts interpreted the report as an 
encouragement for the fed to relax credit and thus as a possible 
harbinger of lower interest rates the dow jones average of 30 
industrials climbed 2542 points to 248786 its fourth consecutive 
gain 
the increase in the civilian jobless rate from 52 percent in may 
to 53 percent last month was not unexpected most economists had 
predicted the rate would hold steady or edge up a notch 
more attention was focused on the departments report that 
nonfarm businesses added just 180000 jobs last month after a 
revised payroll expansion of 207000 jobs in may for the past four 
months businesses added an average of just below 200000 jobs a 
month well below the nearly 300000 average monthly gains posted in 
1988 
virtually all of the june growth came in the service sector with 
the goodsproducing sectors of manufacturing and construction 
posting declines of 31000 and 8000 jobs respectively 
this is certainly consistent with the picture that the economy 
is growing at a slower rate than it has been with a real weakness 
in the goodsproducing industries where you would expect the 
impact of high interest rates to be most severe said pierre 
ellis a senior economist with boston co economic advisers inc 
those higher interest rates are attributed to the feds more than 
yearlong campaign to slow growth by holding tight on credit an 
effort which appears to have given way in recent weeks to an easing 
of monetary policy 
the campaign has produced the slower rate of economic growth the 
central bank desired but ellis and other analysts said it was 
troubling that the burden for the slowdown to date has been borne 
almost solely in the goodsproducing industries because declines in 
those areas generally occur prior to a recession 
ellis predicted a recession in early 1990 merrill lynch has said 
one is likely in the second half of this year 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm disputed 
those estimates and said continued monthly job growth in the 200000 
range would allow the economy to slow without toppling into 
recession 
in another sure indicator of slowing economic growth the labor 
department said the average factory workweek slipped slipped 01 of 
an hour to 409 hours last month the first time this indicator has 
fallen below 41 hours since september 1987 
there was a bit of encouraging news regarding inflation the 
department reported average hourly earnings of production and 
supervisory workers were essentially unchanged for the first five 
months of the year hourly wages had grown on average by 03 
percent but analysts cautioned against reading too much into the 
monthtomonth figures because the number often vary over a period 
of just a few months 
the payroll numbers are taken from the departments monthly 
survey of business establishments 
data from a separate household survey used to set the 
unemployment rate found that the civilian labor force grew by 
492000 people from may to june to a total of 1241 million that 
increase came after a reported decline in the labor force in may and 
likely was influenced by summer entrants into the job market 
of the civilian labor force 1175 million held jobs and 65 
million were looking for work but could not find it the government 
said 
among most demographic groups the unemployment rate was unchanged 
or up just slightly but increases in joblessness were reported for 
teenagers in general and black female teenagers in particular the 
rate for the latter group shot up from 28 percent in may to more 
than 40 percent last month 
among all teenagers the unemployment rate rose from 152 percent 
to 156 percent that came as the labor force for that age group 
grew by more than 100000 apparently due to an influx of students 
into the labor market 
the government said blacks made up the bulk of the new teenagers 
in the labor force in contrast to young black women male black 
teenagers had some success in finding jobs as their unemployment 
rate fell more than 3 percentage points to a stillhigh 335 percent 
the civilian jobless rate has been hovering in the 5 percent 
range for more than a year it was 54 percent in june 1988 and fell 
to a more than 15year low of 50 percent in march before heading 
upward most analysts believe it will climb to 55 percent or higher 
by years end

federal trade sanctions that stalled the delivery 
of three boeing jetliners to china last month have been lifted a 
boeing spokesman said friday 
three 757200s valued at 150 million will be delivered as soon 
as possible said boeing commercial airplanes spokesman randy 
harrison 
the planes were to be delivered in june but were held up when the 
state departments office of munitions control suspended the export 
licenses for crucial navigational components in the aircraft 
department spokesman ken bailes has said 
president bush halted all sales of military equipment to china 
following the killing of hundreds of prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijing on june 4 
the state department on friday lifted the suspensions on the 
three planes and on one other plane that is scheduled for delivery 
later this month harrison said 
as far as i know the state department has reviewed the 
suspensions and decided that these items are not part of the 
original intent of the presidential trade sanctions harrison said 
state department spokesman dennis harter said the suspension 
order was lifted for honeywell corp navigational systems used in 
the boeing planes the navigational systems are on the controlled 
us munitions list 
our decision is in keeping with the presidents intent not to 
disrupt nonmilitary commercial trade with the peoples republic of 
china and was based on the fact that these navigational systems are 
designed for inclusion in civilian products and are critical to the 
safe operation of commercial aircraft harter said 
to have denied these exports would have jeopardized the safety 
of civilian airline passengers traveling in china 
harter said the order also authorizes honeywell to repair and 
replace defective navational systems in civilian chinese aircraft 
original dates of delivery of two aircraft to guangzhou airlines 
were june 12 and june 22 the due date for one airplane for shanghai 
airlines was june 17 harrison said 
the planes have a twoclass seating configuration for between 176 
and 180 passengers harrison said he did not know when actual 
delivery would take place 
the chinese aviation administration corporation system already 
operates five 757200s harrison said the chinese government has 
purchased 61 boeing airplanes of all models since 1971 with a total 
value of 235 billion 
the chinese government is still awaiting delivery of another 
seven aircraft the 11plane deal is valued at 650 million

an 1804 silver dollar one of the most prized 
coins known to collectors was sold at auction friday for 990000 
the highest amount ever bid for a coin 
hugh sconyers of the american rare coin fund in los angeles 
purchased the 1804 silver dollar for 900000 and the 10 percent 
auction fee at the auction 89 sale at the hyatt regency chicago 
he called the purchase a cut and dried business decision 
its perhaps one of the most famous coins in all of numismatics 
and our fund feels that it reprsents a good longterm value 
sconyers said after the record purchase 
the most ever paid for any coin at auction was 725000 for a 
1793 colonial brasher doubloon in 1979 the current auction record 
for a us coin is 625000 paid in 1982 for an 1870s 5 gold piece 
the 1804 dollar is one of only 15 us silver dollars bearing 
that date although none actually was minted in 1804 
during the 1830s us leaders needed gifts to be given to 
foreign governments by ambassadors so mint workers retrieved an 
unused 1803 dollar die and changed the date to 1804 only 15 such 
coins were struck during the next 30 years 
seven of the 1804 dollars are in museums and individual 
collectors hold the remaining eight 
the coin sold at auction friday belonged to leon hendrickson

winchester ind 
hendrickson said he bought the coin for 500000 four years ago 
from george vogt of houston i bugged him for a few years to sell 
it and he finally did he said 
its the king of the coins said the 62yearold hendrickson 
who began collecting coins during the 1940s hendrickson said he 
decided to sell the silver dollar after having openheart surgery 
last year

the vast majority of assault weapons barred 
from importation since spring will be banned permanently from this 
country the government announced friday 
the ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons including 
the popular chinesemade ak47 and israelimade uzi carbine 
followed a fourmonth study by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the gun 
control act of 1968 which barred importation of weapons that are 
not used for legitimate sporting purposes 
the study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in 
the number of these weapons being imported and police reports of 
their use in violent crime said stephen e higgins director of 
the atf bureau 
while the 43 were banned permanently another seven whose imports 
had been suspended since early spring will be available for import 
again as a result of the study those include six 22 rimfire 
caliber rifles and a gun called the valmet hunter which had been 
considered an ak47 type of weapon during the suspension

matters under investigation janet hale a specialist at the office 
of management and budget spent five years at the department of

kemps comments were his most direct to date in appraising the 
difficulties he inherited when he became housing secretary earlier

honest man did not in my view manage hud as carefully or closely 
as it should have been managed he told reporters after speaking 
to a republican group 
that reflects on mr pierce and i say this with sadness not 
anger it reflects on the reagan administration kemp said he and 
president bush will be to blame kemp said if they are unsuccessful

gen augusto pinochet is using his 
lameduck presidency to make influential political and judicial 
appointments expected to endure long after a civilian successor is 
elected in december 
opposition politicians and jurists expect pinochets apparent 
efforts to build a lasting base of power for the future will largely 
fail but they concede that with the 60000man army behind him 
the rightwing general could yet pose a formidible obstacle to the 
transition to civilian government 
pinochet has said he wont be a candidate in the election but 
plans to remain army commander after he gives up the presidency he 
seized in the 1973 coup that overthrew salvador allende a marxist 
under a constitution his adminstration crafted pinochet and the 
chiefs of the other armed forces are legally entitled to their 
commands until 1998 
pinochet recently said he does not plan to be subordinate to the 
new civilian president and speaks of a kind of cohabitation 
with him 
in an evident bid to preserve enough influence for such a 
relationship however his administration has begun renewing its 
appointments of loyal followers at the local and national level 
from town halls to the supreme court once designated they cannot 
easily be replaced even after the change of government 
the renewal began within weeks of pinochets resounding 
referendum defeat in october when voters rejected a military 
proposal that he remain president until 1997 the loss obliged 
pinochet to schedule presidential and congressional elections for 
dec 14 the new government begins a fouryear term on march 11 
one of pinochets most powerful aides gen patricio serre the 
subsecretary for regional development has been overseeing the 
sytematic replacement of 319 apppointed mayors nationwide their 
terms are for four years and they will wield extensive powers of 
patronage and local spending 
many of those being replaced including some retired military 
officers have announced plans to run for congress as a kind of 
propinochet bloc 
in an effort to revamp the 17man supreme court the government 
recently made a unique 90day offer to 10 justices more than 75 
years old of special pension benefits the equivalent of 53000 in a 
windfall payout each to be added to regular monthly pension of 
about 900 it is an extraordinary sum by chilean standards 
the 10 justices face automatic retirement when the new government 
comes in to get the pension they have to step down by 
midseptember which would give pinochets adminstration time to 
appoint successors 
justices serve fiveyear terms and have authority that extends 
far beyond simple questions of law the court for example 
designates three members of a sevenmember constitutional tribunal 
that has final word on constitutional questions and four of the 
national election boards five members the supreme court president 
is one of the influential national security councils eight members 
the government also has accelerated its program for privatizing 
many of the industries that remain in state hands and plans a law 
that will make the central bank largely autonomous with the new 
president unable to replace its director and other key officers 
critics have denounced the measure as a bid to deprive the new 
government of control over economic policy 
nonetheless the opposition contends that pinochets efforts will 
sink in a sea of political change after the election they point to 
opinion polls indicating that presidential candidate patricio 
aylwin a christian democrat backed by a united centerleft 
opposition has a nearly insurmountable lead 
jorge schaulsohn a leader of the leftofcenter party for 
democracy said in an interview he expected the lastminute 
appointees to shift sympathies or at least show themselves to be 
flexible when the new government takes over 
in a democratic environment it doesnt matter who appointed 
you he said im sure youll be smart enough to understand that 
you have to adapt to what the country wants this happens 
everywhere 
in addition aylwin has said his priority will be a plan to 
democratize the countrys municipal system and hold elections to 
replace appointed mayors 
schaulsohn acknowledged however that pinochets grip on the 
army commanders post poses a danger he said the opposition 
planned a campaign to persuade the armed forces that it was not in 
their or the countrys interests to have pinochet remain army chief 
schaulsohn said he suspected pinochet is trying to negotiate 
some kind of immunity for himself and his troops some of whom are 
accused of human rights violations including illegal arrest torture 
and execution 
francisco cumplido a constitutional expert and member of the 
christian democratic party said human rights would be one of the 
thorniest issues in the transition 
more than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested 
tortured or sent into exile in a wave of antileftist repression 
after the 1973 coup in recent years atrocities have declined 
significantly but some repression of dissidents continues human 
rights groups say 
pinochet recently said he was considering a general amnesty for 
security forces members who might face prosecution in little 
cases of human rights abuse

85 toll too much for users of japans new inland sea bridge 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
japan built a hightechnology wonder of a 
bridge to bring a small island into the modern era but local 
residents and industries say they cant afford its 85 roundtrip 
toll 
the sixmile seto inland sea bridge which opened a year ago to 
connect japans honshu island with shikoku island was the final 
ground link in a longheld dream to connect japans four main 
islands 
but the 85 toll set to offset the 779 billion cost of the 
bridge doesnt entice many motorists or truckers 
excitement and local pride built to a fever pitch at the opening 
of the bridge in april 1988 because it meant shikokus 42 million 
people would have a link to honshu japans largest island 
during 10 years of construction they viewed the doubletiered 
network of six bridges and connecting viaducts as a rite of passage 
into japans modern era 
residents on both sides of the seto inland sea believe however 
the bridge has given the region a psychological boost 
before the bridge the seto inland sea divided the cultures of 
the islands and isolated shikoku said teruo hamaie a newscaster 
on the tv network rsk in okayama a city of 600000 people on 
honshu but now the two peoples feel integrated 
while the bridge has increased tourism it has become a 
curiosity it has brought little concrete benefit to shikokus 
industrial quarter 
local fisheries and produce growers looked forward to the bridge 
because it would mean they no longer would have to rely on ferry 
boats often subject to the areas unpredictable weather for 
deliveries 
but they say their delivery trucks continue to use the ferries 
although ferry tolls are also high about 95 one way for the 
90mile trip from shikoku to the port of kobe regular users get up 
to 40 percent discounts and save on the bridge toll gasoline and 
tolls for new highways on the honshu side of the bridge 
the companies say they save money by transporting their goods by 
sea as far as possible and their drivers get a chance to rest 
katsushige matsuda manager of the kagawa fishery cooperatives 
said that on bad days his trucks will wait for hours for fog to 
lift rather than use the bridge when shikokus new takamatsu 
airport is completed this year the cooperative will invest in air 
delivery service rather than use the bridge 
we cant say that the bridge has had any merit for the fishing 
industry matsuda said 
the high bridge toll also has kept regular motorists off the 
bridge as well 
less than half the expected daily traffic was recorded in the 
first year of the bridges operation an average of 10800 vehicles 
crossed every day and projected revenues fell short by 137 million 
but railway traffic during the period was higher than expected 
for about 270 a ticket about 30000 passengers rode the japan 
railways trains that speed across the bridges lower deck 144 times 
a day in both directions 
the areas tourist industry has benefited from the bridge 
however more than twice as many tourists as in 1987 flocked to 
shikokus kagawa prefecture last year most of them drawn by the 
bridge itself in the process they booked 5000 more hotel rooms 
than the year before and consumed thousands of tons of udon noodles 
a local specialty 
in the town of sakaide on shikoku a 520foot tower for viewing 
the seto inland sea and the bridge was built for the new flow of 
tourists 
across the islandstudded sea in okayama prefecture a major 
tourism makeover is taking shape the city of uno a 
downattheheel port since the decline of japans shipbuilding 
industry is the site of a 137 million spanish village a vast 
amusement and marine park to open in 1992 
century park tivoli a 3435 million amusement center based 
on one in copenhagen denmark is expected to open in 1994 
these projects wouldnt have come to this region without the 
interest generated by the bridge said douglas smith an american 
who is the coordinator of international relations in okayamas 
commerce and industry department 
there is a sense that 1988 wasnt the big year in okayama that 
there is more to come

young descendants of immigrants 
who crossed the atlantic in years past to work in the fields and 
factories of argentina are taking the journey in reverse nowadays as 
the nation sinks deep into recession 
this is my home and i hope to return to it and live and die 
here but not if it means starving to death because i dont have any 
work aldo bignone a 23yearold auto mechanic said as he stood 
outside the spanish consulate to apply for a visa 
rodrigo imas a 30yearold print shop employee said his 
grandfather told him many times about the fourweek trip he made 
from italy in the hold of a freighter to start a new life in 
argentina 
now im hoping to find enough money to buy a oneway ticket on 
aerolineas argentinas imas said the transportation has changed 
and the direction is reversed but the idea is the same 
as inflation and interest rates have soared out of control and 
the austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just five 
months ago businesses have closed by the score and thousands of 
workers have been laid off 
argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs have 
watched in dismay as food gasoline cigarettes movie tickets and 
virtually everything else have shot up in price while wages in real 
terms have shrunk 
argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons a decade 
ago it was to escape the violence of leftwing subversion followed 
by a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in march 1976 
for the past several years argentines have left in search of 
economic opportunity however and visa applications have 
accelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months 
with the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar a teacher 
who earned 100 a month at the end of 1988 now might be earning a 
little as 40 a newspaper reporter who earned 300 now earns 90 a 
bilingual marketing administrator could well have seen his pay fall 
from 300 to 135 and a bank economist from 700 to 300 
a lot of people are thinking that their children have limited 
futures said the canadian consul andree bazinet they get all 
these skills at the university and cant use them in argentina we 
get some of our highest quality acceptances from argentina 
in 1986 the canadian embassy received 188 applications for 
immigrant visas and in the first five months of this year 
applications stood at 1292 only 275 were issued 
the argentine government issues no figures on the number or job 
skills of emigrants but officials at variousd consulates said visa 
applications are way up and usually its the best educated and best 
trained who are taken 
the longest lines are outside the consulates of spain and italy 
the countries to which a majority of argentines trace their roots 
italy generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants and 
spain to children of people born in those countries who never 
renounced their citizenship 
those visas are coveted because they will allow argentines to 
work thoughout western europe beginning in 1992 when the european 
economic community is unified into a single market 
australia granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987 the 
consulate said and inquiries for the ninemonth period that ended 
in march skyrocketed to 16330 it gave no figures on the number of 
visas to be granted 
daniel fainstein dean of the latin american rabbinic seminary 
estimated that 2000 jews left argentina last year for israel 
there has been an increase because of the permanent 
instability and insecurity here he said 
the united states issued 1450 to 1500 immigrant visas to 
argentines in the past few years a consular officer said the 
number of applications is not kept but it clearly exceeds the 
number of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months 
the official added 
standing in line at the us consulate jose ponti said he hopes 
to move to baltimore md to work in his uncles clothing store 
my family split in two after world war ii said ponti 27 
who works on the buenos aires subway one part went to the us 
another part came here to argentina the american side of the family 
is doing very well

time has neither diminished the pain nor dimmed the memories of 
gwen and joe kopechne after two decades of mourning their only child 
oh god there are a million of them said mrs kopechne of 
her daughter mary jo who died 20 years ago when a car driven by 
sen edward m kennedy plunged off a narrow bridge on chappaquiddick 
island next to marthas vineyard in massachusetts 
theres so darn many things she said we was three people 
together all the time and even her being away from home we were 
closely in touch our whole life is wrapped around our kid 
their memories of mary jo are never more vivid than on the 
anniversary of the accident each july 18 all these many years 
later they are still reeling through uncertainty and anxiety amidst 
renewed charges of a coverup to save kennedys political career 
mary jos portrait a gift to her from a boyfriend of long ago 
stares down at them from a wall in the living room a haunting 
reminder that she died a week before her 29th birthday 
autographed photos of kennedys brothers president john f 
kennedy and attorney general robert f kennedy stand side by side 
in the sitting room another journey back to a time when mary jo 
worked in their presidential campaigns indeed that is what had 
taken her to chappaquiddick that july weekend a cookout and reunion 
for a dozen men and women who had worked in roberts 1968 campaign 
everything we look at reminds us of our daughter mrs 
kopechne said in a telephone interview from her home in the pocono 
mountains of pennsylvania there are a lot of knickknacks around 
of hers we never put anything of hers away 
there are no photos of edward kennedy absolutely not said 
mary jos father asked if he was bitter toward kennedy he 
answered yes and no then paused no i dont want to answer 
anything like that 
i wouldnt go out of my way to be friendly said mrs 
kopechne he doesnt mean anything to me 
she said she could not remember the last time she talked to 
kennedy maybe it was when he was running for the 1980 
presidential nomination 
the years have taken a physical toll on the kopechnes and the 
20th anniversary of the tragedy promises to be emotional just the 
other day mrs kopechne 71 had to go to the doctor 
the stress is getting too much for me she said im 
falling apart i dont want to talk i get too upset just having to 
talk about it constantly weve been bothered with people on the 
property theyve been knocking on our bedroom door we dont answer 
the door we didnt answer the phone for a couple of weeks but 
thats ridiculous that we cant even answer our own phone 
mrs kopechne had surgery for suspected cancer last january 
they found no cancer she said i came out clean but this is 
what they watch with me now 
kopechne 76 underwent cancer surgery 12 years ago about the 
same time he retired as an insurance salesman i lost half my 
stomach my spleen my gallbladder part of my pancreas but hell 
it didnt make any difference to me im still going better than i 
ever did 
he plays tennis three or four times a week and occasionally he 
volunteers his help to meals on wheels delivering food to the 
elderly he is an avid reader with particular interest in nutrition 
i follow my nutritional value he said thats whats 
keeping me going there are proper foods and the proper way of 
looking at things your outlook on life that means a hell of a 
lot 
the kopechnes declined to talk much about kennedy but mrs 
kopechne said she was glad the foreman in the grand jury 
investigation of mary jos death recently renewed allegations that 
officials tried to cover up information to protect kennedy 
several members of the same grand jury also asserted a district 
attorney prevented the jury from calling several key witnesses 
including kennedy and his cousin joseph gargan jr because they 
had testified previously at an inquest 
im glad to see somebody else coming along she said 
theres where the answers are partly up there we dont know 
anything we wait to hear from somebody else were glad to hear 
somebody else has come out and said something 
kennedy who waited 10 hours before notifying authorities of the 
accident has taken full responsibility and expressed remorse for 
the tragedy over the years most recently in a prepared statement 
issued shortly before the anniversary 
there was a full and complete investigation by authorities and 
there have been extensive additional investigations by the press 
he said i have expressed my remorse and reponsibility to my own 
family to the kopechne family and to the people of massachusetts 
and i express those sentiments again i have told everything i know 
about the accident 
he hasnt said anything he hasnt said before said mrs 
kopechne i think theres a lot can be said that wasnt said 
thirteen years ago the kopechnes moved from berkeley heights 
nj back to joes native pennsylvania buying a brick ranch home 
in swiftwater pa 120 miles from philadelphia they paid for it 
with a 140904 settlement they received from kennedy and his 
insurance company 
we wanted to be in between our friends in new jersey and 
pennsylvania kopechne said 
they are closer to mary jo now only 50 miles away an hour and 
20 minute drive she is buried halfway up a mountain near a church 
they once attended a few miles from forty fort a town of 5500 
people where kopechne grew up they visit mary jos grave about once 
a month never letting her memory fade 
you wouldnt either if you had a daughter like her said

samuel f pickering jr is not above telling 
a lie to make a good story better and he encourages the students in 
his writing course to do the same 
youve got to lie to give the illusion of truth the english 
professor tells his students at the university of connecticut 
given that philosophy its not surprising that pickering finds 
himself caught up in the excitement over a bit of fiction written by 
a former student the teacher john keating played by robin williams 
in the movie dead poets society is modeled after pickering 
like keating pickering has been known to do the unusual in his 
classroom hes lectured from a desktop from outside a window or 
while wearing wastepaper baskets on his feet he also returned to 
his prep school as a young teacher after studying in england but 
unlike the movie there was never any conflict between pickering and 
school administrators and he left the school on good terms 
whatever of me is in that character has got to be small the 
47yearold pickering said during recent interview at his home i 
was a kid and he was a child twentythree years ago how much of me 
could there be in the movie not very much 
the screenplay was written by tom schulman who was a 15yearold 
student at montgomery bell academy in nashville tenn when he took 
a course from pickering pickering who had returned to the united 
states after a year of study at cambridge university taught at the 
private school for just one year 196566 
schulman has acknowledged pickerings influence on his life and 
the screenplay and has said much of his love for language and 
literature originated in that course 
pickering hasnt seen the movie his three children were sick 
and now hes in canada for the summer but many of his friends in 
nashville have seen the film and they immediately recognized 
pickering as the inspiration for the movies teacher the friends 
began talking and soon the news media picked up on the subject 
i dont mind being the center of attention if i can control it 
but i cant control this he said of the numerous inquiries hes 
received from reporters and acquaintances 
pickering who was born and raised in nashville is puzzled as to 
why he had so much influence on a former student and how it was that 
his friends so readily saw him in the movie hes also flattered 
im the most ordinary guy in the world he said as he draped 
his leg over the arm of a chair and picked at a hole in the knee of 
his jeans sometimes people remember me and i dont know why i 
dont know if i did anything special then as a teacher i was young 
and lively 
what he does in class is unplanned he said he does many unusual 
things to get his students to think for themselves but a bad back 
has forced him to abandon such acrobatics as desktop lectures his 
classroom is also on the second floor now making the leaps from 
windows unwise 
sometimes you get bored in the classroom he said this 
semester when my class was over the last class two girls in my 
class jumped up and gave an imitation of me right in front of the 
class they got as youd think they might get fs but ive 
learned since 
pickering bursts into laughter after telling the story he laughs 
often and easily as he recalls the past he finds many things 
humorous in life and often downplays his own accomplishments 
since leaving montgomery bell academy he has completed a 
doctorate and taught in syria and jordon and at dartmouth college 
hes been at the university of connecticut since 1978 where in 
addition to teaching hes become wellknown as an essayist 
he writes about his three children his wife his mother and 
father and ordinary things in life his writing as might be 
expected is humorous and selfcritical but also bawdy and 
philosophical he has published three books of his essays and is 
working on a fourth he plans to write an essay on the celebrity 
that has come to him in the wake of dead poets society 
his most recent book may days university of iowa 1988 
includes an essay on montgomery bell academy it pokes fun at the 
idea of a southern gentleman and pickerings exploits as a 
student athlete and practical joker 
from these experiences pickering has shaped a teaching 
philosophy that has in turn influenced many others 
there are very few givens that i accept i dont reject any 
either but i think that kids ought to start looking pickering 
said when somebody says its green then you should turn around 
and say maybe its not green whats the truth thats all i do

with their first album of new material in nine 
years zooming up the charts the original members of the doobie 
brothers band are taking it to the streets but theyre taking it 
easier between shows 
i think everybodys just wanting to take care of themselves a 
little better than they used to lead singer tom johnston said in 
a recent interview during a twoday stop in the detroit area 
consequently everybodys a little quieter when they go back to 
their room than they used to be they dont stay out all night 
boogying 
added drummer john hartman 70 pounds lighter than the last time 
he did any intense touring the road treats us the same we just 
dont treat it the same 
these doobies made up the earliest version of the band the 
guitarbased act with a hard rock style that recorded such hits as 
china grove listen to the music jesus is just alright 
and black water 
the new album cycles already has gone gold more than 
500000 copies sold within two weeks of release it means there will 
be at least one more doobies album johnston says he has six or 
seven songs waiting at home including one yanked from cycles at 
the last minute 
the first single from the album the doctor was at no 11 on 
the billboard charts as of june 30 its sound most often compared 
with china grove should be no surprise hartman said 
you come out with a new album youre supposed to sound like 
what montovanni hartman asked sarcastically youve got the 
same guys who wrote the same hits back in the early days whats 
johnston supposed to sound like elvis 
johnston hartman guitarist patrick simmons bassist tiran 
porter drummer michael hossack and percussionist bobby lakind make 
up this version of the band whose evolution requires a scorecard 
there were 14 doobies none of them related from 1972 to 1982 
the johnstonled band gave way to the slicker rhythm and blues 
version fronted by michael mcdonald in the late 70s that scored the 
hits takin it to the streets what a fool believes which 
was named record of the year at the grammy awards in 1979 and the 
grammy winningalbum minute by minute 
a 1987 reunion concert for vietnam veterans brought a dozen 
doobies together it led to a minitour and a fourth of july concert 
in moscow after that the musicians went their separate ways 
producer ted templeman who was with the band through all its 
changes talked to johnston and the original doobies about getting 
back together for a new album 
we were all playing in bands around the bay area and recording 
and doing stuff it just wasnt on a very big scale johnston 
said basically it was like starting all over again we all knew 
each other the music its all new tunes thats why the album was 
called cycles because weve been through a lot of cycles mostly 
the spin cycle 
the success of cycles never was guaranteed but air play of 
the doctor coupled with classic rock radio play of oldies has 
created a new generation of doobie fans 
kids from 17 on up have been showing up at the concerts as well 
as people who knew us from before johnston said i think they 
find it interesting to go back and listen to the 70stype stuff as 
well as what weve doing on the new album 
success still is welcome to a band even after it has sold 80 
million albums 
i knew a lot of people wanted to hear rock n roll doobie 
brothers and stuff said johnston we didnt try to make this 
album sound like 1974 we tried to make it sound like the songs we 
had written 
this time out the doobies are playing 12 to 14 concerts then 
laying off for 10 days before beginning another round there are 65 
concerts planned on the cycles tour 
we used to do 200plus gigs a year and when we werent 
gigging we were in the studio so you never saw home and you never 
really got rested up johnston said i dont want to go out for 
that many dates a year anymore anyway its crazy and i dont think 
you need to i dont think we needed to back then either 
these days family members travel occasionally with the band 
members hartman whose family prefers to stay behind gets out to 
museums parks and shopping malls johnston and others read novels 
were not trashing hotel rooms anymore and were not having 
door wars with rentacars burning up stages and things of that 
nature johnston said everybodys become a little bit more 
selective especially being married they dont mess around

forget for a moment if you will the monthsold 
debate on wall street over whether the economy is headed for a 
recession 
consider instead the possibility that such a slump might already 
have begun 
this is by no means a majority view or even suspicion among the 
economists of the financial world many economists still argue that 
the recent slowing of the economy will bottom out with nothing worse 
than a spell of sluggish growth 
once that happy news is established they contend the rallying 
cry will be onward and upward for both the stock market and the 
producing and consuming economy 
nevertheless some observers say if a recession is destined to 
occur it would be very much in keeping with past patterns if it 
were to sneak in unnoticed and take a firm hold several months 
before its presence is officially detected 
such a sneakattack effect can be enhanced by the 
muchpublicized but still easily overlooked lag time between 
economic events and the reporting of data used to measure them 
the statistics that lately have heightened recession worries have 
covered may and june the latter stages of the second quarter of 
1989 but even as investors react to them the third quarter is well 
under way 
the formal definition of recession as established by the 
national bureau of economic research is at least two consecutive 
quarters of declines in the gross national product after adjustment 
for inflation 
if that kind of an event were to occur in the third and fourth 
quarters of this year it wouldnt be certified as such until early 
1990 
of course the government and private economists employ other 
tools to try to get a more uptodate reading of where things are 
headed 
one of these the commerce departments index of leading economic 
indicators dropped 12 percent in may for its third decline in four 
months bordering on the traditional standard that recognizes three 
down months in a row as a recession warning 
weve never been much of a fan of this index as a gauge to 
future economic growth said david resler economist at nomura 
securities international in new york but this latest report had 
an ominous quality to it 
given the leading indicators spotty record in the past many 
private analysts have their own favorite statistical barometers 
subscribers to the doctrine known as monetarism for instance 
argue that slow or no growth in the money supply has already sounded 
a clear signal of trouble ahead 
others cite the inverted yield curve with shortterm 
interest rates higher than longterm interest rates that has 
prevailed for much of this year as a likely portent of stormy 
weather 
no matter how many forecasting aids are available though it 
seems evident that the soft landing vs recession argument on 
wall street wont be settled until some months after the fact 
all the reports since early this year showing a slowing of 
economic growth are also the way that recessions come about 
observed raymond f devoe jr an analyst at legg mason wood walker 
inc 
if continued as theyre now tracking devoe added they 
would indicate the growing likelihood of a recession if the 
economy is not already in one

while pete roses betting makes headlines 
millions of less prominent lives are afflicted by an addiction to 
gambling that some experts fear may become more widespread 
we are viewing compulsive gambling as the mental health 
epidemic of the 1990s declares valerie lorenz executive director 
of the national center for pathological gambling in baltimore 
adds sirgay sanger president of the national council on 
compulsive gambling in new york i think were possibly headed 
into a decade in which gambling will be the addiction of choice 
among young people 
it may be seen as a readily available and attractive alternative 
if alcohol and drugs become less popular he says 
almost 253 billion was bet in the united states last year 
legally and illegally according to the magazine gaming and wagering 
business tables games such as roulette and baccarat drew 126 
billion and slot machines about 37 billion lotteries and 
parimutuel events such as horse racing each took in more than 17 
billion the magazine says 
the vast majority of gamblers are not addicted to betting but 
perhaps 3 percent of american adults which comes to about 5 million 
people are hooked so are a significant percentage of high school 
students some studies suggest 
fifteen years ago the compulsive gambler was typically a 
middleage white businessman lorenz said but now treatment 
programs see people in their teens and early 20s deeply in debt 
suicidal and threatened by bookies 
she said she expects compulsive gambling to grow as more states 
adopt lotteries and other games of chance to raise revenue 
promoting the idea of gambling and making it easier for susceptible 
people to become hooked 
already we are seeing an increase in all forms of gambling 
said lorenz some 15 percent of calls to her organizations hotline 
are from people who say they are hooked on lotteries she said 
while six years ago i never heard of a lottery addict 
but j blaine lewis jr president of the north american 
association of state and provincial lotteries said experts have 
told him that lotteries do not interest most compulsive gamblers 
the addicts want faster action such as casino games and games of 
perceived skill rather than pure chance lewis said 
while lotteries may promote the idea of gambling its a long 
step to say then that that gets people to be compulsive gamblers 
lewis said 
roses situation does not directly involve the question of 
whether he is a compulsive gambler and lorenz and sanger said they 
could not make a diagnosis from news stories 
but lorenz said rose shows some traits consistently found in 
compulsive gamblers competitiveness intelligence ability with 
numbers athletic ability and a high energy level and his denials 
of improper betting in the face of overwhelming evidence suggest 
the reaction of a compulsive gambler she said 
people who buy a lottery ticket every day or bet substantial sums 
are not necessarily compulsive gamblers the addiction involves a 
collection of other specific behaviors 
for example compulsive gamblers may continue betting despite 
mounting debts the disintegration of life at home and on the job 
and their own efforts to stop 
they may have to bet more and more in order to feel the 
excitement they crave they may frequently gamble more money or for 
a longer time than planned and may repeatedly try to win back 
losses 
the goal is not to gain money but to gamble they may bet on a 
sure loser or on both sides of a contest just to stay in the 
action 
for these people gambling is a way to feel alive to feel 
powerful in a generally powerless life to feel accepted to feel 
special 
but when compulsive gamblers hit bottom they often are in debt 
for one or two times their annual salaries lorenz said many will 
have turned to writing bad checks forgery or embezzlement to fuel 
their habit 
about one in five who enter gamblers anonymous or treatment 
programs has tried suicide studies suggest 
what kinds of people become compulsive gamblers 
young and old rich and poor black and white all 
socioeconomic levels all educational levels lorenz said 
many excelled in athletics in high school and college she said 
and her organizations hotline gets an occasional call from 
professional athletes who fear that if they seek help they will be 
identified and fired 
compulsive gamblers also frequently grew up in a family with an 
unusual emphasis on money whether it was a very poor family or a 
rich one that set a high economic standard for the child she said 
with treatment gamblers can be freed of a disorder that hands 
them a greater loss than any of their bets 
lorenz said she recently testified on behalf of a bank officer a 
basically honest man with two children who had embezzled 1 million 
to pay off his bookies 
he had nothing to show for it lorenz said other than the 
action of gambling

its not even the same bridge 
anymore new posts and guardrails have been added but that was some 
time ago and now dike bridge is rotting gulls fly over and drop 
shellfish on it to break open their supper 
not much to it no signs no reminders 
but dike bridge is on chappaquiddick 
it lives oversized in american political history because sen 
edward m kennedy drove his oldsmobile off the bridge into poucha 
pond around midnight 20 years ago 
mary jo kopechne a 28yearold washington secretary was found 
dead in the back seat about 10 hours later kennedy then 37 did 
not notify police until 930 am long after he returned to his 
hotel across the water on marthas vineyard 
he said he and a friend repeatedly dove to the car in 
unsuccessful rescue attempts and that he was then exhausted and 
in a state of shock 
since the accident the night of july 18 1969 massachusetts 
voters have reelected kennedy four times to the senate by healthy 
margins but most people think the string of events that occurred 
after he left a cottage party that night probably cost him the white 
house 
the incident has been an albatross around the islands neck as 
well 
like kennedy most longtime chappaquiddick residents dont like 
to discuss the accident it is a bitter memory the day their 
pastoral existence became the focus of the worst sort of publicity 
the heir to the kennedy family dynasty had sullied not just his 
reputation but theirs too 
when asked about the accident and the impact its had on their 
lives vineyarders who have lived in edgartown or on chappaquiddick 
island for more than 20 years often become silent 
one edgartown real estate agent usually smiling and friendly 
momentarily choked up when asked about the accident and then refused 
to discuss it 
jane tomassian the head of the marthas vineyard historical 
preservation society has lived in edgartown eight years she has 
sensed some of her neighbors resentment about the incident 
marthas vineyard prechappaquiddick was sort of a quiet 
vacation spot the international attention that centered here 
immediately after the incident and during the trial and the focus 
that has been put on the vineyard since then has really 
unfortunately put the vineyard on the map tomassian said 
kennedy eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an 
accident and received a twomonth suspended prison sentence he was 
placed on probation for one year 
judge james a boyle who oversaw the ninemonth inquest 
expressed doubt about key portions of kennedys testimony when 
boyles final report was released in april 1970 the case was 
officially closed but public debate over its ramifications 
continues 
the dike bridge connects a beautiful strip of beach with the rest 
of chappaquiddick island at the eastern side of marthas vineyard 
in may tall fences were erected on either side of the bridge long 
since closed to vehicular traffic and the only way to reach the 
beach now is to drive an allterrain vehicle south for about five 
miles before doubling back north 
town officials are concerned about safety at the bridge but 
sporadic arguments over the years reveal another factor in the move 
to tear it down embarrassment over the dubious tourist attraction 
most tourists dont journey to marthas vineyard soley to see the 
scene of what has been called the most famous traffic fatality in 
the history of american politics but as long as theyre down 
there its right across the ferry 
yeah people ask about it every day said a teenage girl 
running the fourcar ferry from edgartown to chappaquiddick island 
we get a car asking on every trip across 
once tourists get out to dike bridge theres not a lot to see 
just a simple wooden bridge across a decidedly uninteresting pond 
beyond the bridge are the dunes and still farther the vast blue of 
nantucket sound 
they find themselves very disappointed said patric jamo a 
waiter at a restaurant on the edge of edgartown harbor theres 
really nothing there 
linda malcouronne the president of the edgartown board of trade 
and manager of the colonial inn contends the bridge isnt that much 
of a tourist draw she says most of the summertime tourists choose 
the vineyard for other reasons and visitors might not even be aware 
of the significance of the bridge 
its a whole other time a time warp malcouronne said 
whether the islanders like it or not though the accident is 
fixed in their psyche a headline that appeared in the vineyard 
gazette referred to the debate over tearing down the kennedy 
bridge 
just up the block from the colonial inn is the shiretown inn the 
hotel where kennedy stayed on his visit two decades ago kennedy had 
walked through the hotels lobby the morning of the accident and 
stood on a balcony talking about yachts with other vacationers 
before he filed an accident report with the edgartown police 
the new owners of the shiretown have taken down a sign that hung 
behind the front desk telling people not to bother asking about 
chappaquiddick or what room kennedy was staying in but they still 
shun inquiries 
we have no comment said a hotel worker who wouldnt give her 
name people dont ask about it its not a big thing anymore we 
werent even around then 
kennedy who has over the years expressed sadness about the 
accident responded with a prepared statement when asked about the 
incident recently 
i took full responsibility for the tragedy at the time and i 
still do kennedy said there was a full and complete 
investigation by authorities and there have been extensive 
additional investigations by the press i have expressed my remorse 
and responsibility to my own family to the kopechne family and to 
the people of massachusetts and i express those sentiments again 
i have told everything i know about the accident i only wish 
that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing 
pain that i feel and that mr and mrs kopechne feel for mary jos 
loss 
in a recent associated press interview mary jo kopechnes 
parents spoke mostly about how they still grieve over the loss of 
their daughter 
mrs kopechne did say she was pleased the foreman in the grand 
jury investigation of her daughters death had recently renewed his 
assertion that officials tried to cover up information to protect 
kennedy 
she had little to say about kennedy but in another interview 
with a magazine she and her husband had harsh words for the senator 
he was worried about himself not mary jo joseph kopechne 
said 
he said his daughter did not die in vain because it kept kennedy 
from becoming president 
kopechne and his wife gwen said they had had two brief meetings 
with the senator since the accident 
those were really ridiculous meetings mrs kopechne said 
nobody told me anything and i didnt even know what to ask i 
want him to tell me what happened cant he relieve us of this

a turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was 
stolen philippines prison inmates trade organs for reduced 
sentences brokers in human body parts take their cut of a shadowy 
market 
the forces of supply and demand in the desperate world of organ 
transplants have created a commercial trade in human organs that 
worries health officials and ethicists worldwide 
the need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as 
research advances and surgery is more successful but the number of 
donated organs has failed to keep pace doctors say too few people 
die in circumstances that provide transplantable organs when they 
do relatives are often too grieved to donate a loved ones organ or 
object for religious or cultural reasons 
what to do about the organ trade varies the united states japan 
and west germany ban it in india such trade thrives legally 
lawmakers in britain and the philippines have just begun grappling 
with the matter 
there simply doesnt seem to be any country that has a public 
policy to generate enough organs to meet the demand said arthur 
caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at the 
university of minnesota 
the world health organization in may called for a global ban on 
commercial trafficking in human organs dr ursula lehr the west 
german health minister spoke for the ban 
the idea of businessminded brokers taking advantage of the 
financial distress of people in the third world buying their organs 
for a pittance and reselling them to wealthy patients in developed 
countries is awful for me she said 
but some ask whats wrong if people fully informed of the risks 
decide to sell one of their organs for example a kidney the 
question however becomes complicated when the potential donor is 
desperately poor people can live with one kidney and offers for 
transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual instances from 
3000 to 20000 
is it really for us who are not faced with those difficulties 
and that heartrending decision to deny people that choice neil 
hamilton a british lawmaker asked in recent parliamentary debate 
it really isnt a choice if youre coerced by poverty said 
caplan the minnesota ethicist 
others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of 
donated organs and make transplants more expensive in general 
we believe organs would go to the highest bidder rather 
than to the patient who needs them most said bernadette haze a 
spokeswoman for the netherlandsbased eurotransplant which matches 
organ donors and recipients in the netherlands belgium luxembourg 
west germany and austria 
britain which has no law controlling the sale of organs took up 
the issue this year after a turk was arrested in istanbul for 
arranging commercial transplants at a private london hospital one 
of the donors contended he was duped and robbed of his kidney 
the alleged organ broker tunc ay kunter was convicted may 18 
and sentenced to two years in prison for brokering the sale of a 
turkish peasants kidney to a libyan doctor police said kunter 
confessed to arranging four such sales when he was arrested 
turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling brokering 
or buying human organs 
the peasant ahmet koc who got a twoyear suspended sentence 
contended he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job 
offer and thought he was being anesthetized for the checkup after 
the kidney was removed he said he was paid the equivalent of 4267 
british lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime 
to pay or receive payment for a human organ parliament is expected 
to pass it this month 
organ sales are not illegal in the philippines but in late may 
the vice president of the philippines senate filed a bill to ban 
sales of human organs and tissues calling practitioners 
modernday draculas 
filipino death row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as 
part of a program to reduce overcrowding without resorting to 
widespread executions explained pablo rosales assistant director 
of the national penitentiary rosales said most donor inmates 
avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few more 
years in prison 
when capital punishment was banned in 1987 prisoners started 
asking for money he said one prisoner who donated a kidney even 
complained to rosales that he received only 95 without the 
minicassette recorder he was promised 
media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking 
prisoners organs rosales said and no prisoner has donated a 
kidney since last year 
but rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors 
most likely poor slum dwellers 
dr kazuo ota chairman of the japan society for transplantation 
said he knew of several patients who had organ transplants in the 
philippines and that some japanese were acting as organ brokers 
organ sales are banned in japan 
dr jorge neumann of the sao paulo heart institute and a member 
of the brazilian association of organ transplants said that 
certainly there exists a black market of organs in brazil but 
he said no statistics on organ sales were available 
last fall reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were 
routinely buying babies in third world countries and selling them to 
american and israeli families whose children needed organ 
transplants prompted outrage from american officials 
the state department in october blamed the soviet union for the 
reports and said a european parliament resolution criticizing the 
purported activity was based on false and misleading statements 
and a discredited report by a soviet front organization 
in the united states selling organs has been illegal since 1984 
and sentiment against the practice is high but allegations of 
influence peddling in arranging precious transplants surface from 
time to time 
in april justice department investigators said they had dropped 
an investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon thomas 
starzl head of transplants at presbyterianuniversity and 
childrens hospitals in pittsburgh had given highpaying foreigners 
preferential treatment 
the investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28 
percent of transplants performed by starzls team in 19845 were on 
foreigners who often werent as sick as other patients or had waited 
a shorter time but who had paid surgeons fees four times higher 
than americans who had the same operations 
caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need rather 
than money or influence determines who gets available organs 
some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced 
if a neutral party such as government replaced organ brokers and 
donations might increase with incentives such as compensation to 
donors or their families for all medical costs time lost from work 
or burial expenses there could also be a break on inheritance or 
other taxes 
recently transplant researchers began looking at animaltohuman 
transplants 
at a may meeting of the american society of transplant 
physicians researchers predicted pigs would become the main source 
of donor organs once crossspecies transplantation becomes practical 
theres always been a shortage of organs and there probably 
always will be unless we learn to take them out of animals said 
caplan i dont know if its going to be biologically feasible 
but i think thats the direction we have to try

the supreme court a legacy of ronald reagans 
presidency veered dramatically to the right in its 198889 term as 
decisions on abortion civil rights and the death penalty 
highlighted an invigorated political conservatism 
the coalescence of a dependable conservative majority led and 
nurtured by chief justice william h rehnquist was so pronounced 
that legal scholars predict it will influence the course of american 
society for decades 
this is the year the rehnquist court came of age said ae 
dick howard a university of virginia law professor we have now 
seen the emergence of a bloc of justices on the court who in at 
least most of the courts agenda can be predictably conservative 
in his first full term justice anthony m kennedy tipped the 
balance of power leading some to compare his role to that of 
arthur goldberg on the liberaldominated court of the 1960s 
kennedy the last of three high court appointments made by former 
president reagan replaced lewis f powell a generally conservative 
justice who most often joined the courts liberal wing on abortion 
and civil rights 
powell served as a fulcrum often the pivotal vote on the most 
divisive issues before the court that role has been inherited by 
justice sandra day oconnor a reagan appointee more conservative 
than powell 
the courts conservatives also include reagan appointee antonin 
scalia and byron r white who was appointed by john f kennedy in 
1962 
most often left in dissent in the terms major cases were 
liberals william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens 
of 132 signed decisions 32 were reached by 54 votes rehnquist 
was in the majority in 81 percent of those brennan in 22 percent 
the two were on opposite sides in 30 of the 32 
the court in 54 votes gave states greater power to regulate 
abortions allowed capital punishment for mentally retarded 
murderers and killers who committed their crimes when as young as 
16 and dismayed civil rights activists in a series of rulings 
the court strayed from its conservative course in several 
freespeech decisions most notably ruling that burning the american 
flag is a constitutionally protected form of political protest

198889 term

another key civil rights law enacted in 1866 cannot be used to

the government may seize criminal suspects assets even if such

the court made it significantly easier for police to stop 
question and search airline passengers suspected of drug 
trafficking the justices upheld the arrest and conviction of a man 
stopped because he matched the profile characteristics of a drug 
courier 
the court upheld sentencing rules that reduce the discretion 
individual judges have in meting out the punishment for various 
federal crimes 
police may stray from the precise wording of the famous miranda 
warnings given to criminal suspects even if the result arguably 
confuses suspects about their right to free legal help

sales picked up slightly at the countrys big chain stores last 
month from mays weak pace but growth was kept in check by a 
general slowdown in economic activity 
the gains were stronger than we had seen in the prior month 
but across the board they were certainly not outstanding said 
joseph ronning a retail industry analyst with the investment firm 
brown brothers harriman amp co 
economists monitor retail sales for clues about consumer 
expenditures which account for about twothirds of the countrys 
economic activity 
the reports from us retailers thursday suggested that spending 
on bigticket goods like home appliances has slowed while outlays 
for less expensive merchandise havent been crimped as much by 
rising credit charges reflecting interest rate hikes earlier this 
year 
several department stores and specialty retailers said they 
benefited again last month from the gradual comeback in womens 
clothing sales following a deep slump during the past two years 
limited inc one of the nations biggest apparel retailers 
posted an 11 percent increase in sales in the five weeks ended july 
1 besides its flagship womens clothing shops limited owns 
specialty stores such as victorias secret and abercrombie amp fitch 
the take at limiteds stores open at least a year called 
samestore or comparable store sales rose 12 percent in june 
retailers and analysts consider the samestore sales a more 
accurate reflection of a companys performance than totals that 
include sales at newly opened stores not every retailer reports 
sales on this basis 
other beneficiaries of the recovery in womens apparel included 
dayton hudson corp which said total june sales rose 142 percent 
the department store operator which also runs target and mervyns 
stores reported samestore sales were up 61 percent 
jc penney co inc attributed its sales pickup to demand for 
summer fashions and increased purchases of soft home furnishings 
like bedding and bath goods its june sales rose 76 percent and 
samestore sales increased 56 percent 
fred wintzer who follows specialty clothing merchants for the 
investment firm alex brown amp sons inc in baltimore said the 
apparel retailers are making progress but they are a little bit 
disappointing given how bad last years results were 
recent monthly sales by apparel sellers may look much better than 
they actually were because they are being compared with last year 
which was an exceptionally bleak time for fashion merchandising 
among the leading general merchandisers k mart corp the 
countrys secondlargest retailer after sears roebuck and co said 
its june sales represented an improvement after a string of 
disappointing months the discounter said sales at all of its stores 
went up 57 percent in june after a 25 percent increase in may 
sales at k marts open at least a year picked up 23 percent in 
june after falling 06 percent in may 
rival discounter walmart stores inc third among us 
retailers turned in another robust performance reporting a 25 
percent increase in total june sales and a 10 percent gain in 
samestore sales 
jeffrey edelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
said industrywide sales were uneven during june with the weaker 
figures from the nonclothing categories 
a series of indexes edelman prepared indicated most types of 
retailers fared better in june than in may the weighted average of 
37 merchants sales on a samestore basis rose 53 percent in june 
after a 42 percent may gain 
the drexel index of sales at 14 department stores and discounters 
rose 46 percent last month vs 38 percent the month before while 
the measurement of apparel retailers repeated a 77 percent increase 
the index for hard goods including furniture electronics and 
household appliances dropped 18 percent in june after rising 34 
percent in may 
in reports from other major retailers thursday 
sears said its sales rose 29 percent in the five weeks ended 
july 1 from a year earlier on a comparablestore basis sears 
sales increased 36 percent 
may department stores co said sales rose 68 percent during the 
five weeks and samestore sales were up 5 percent 
melville corp reported a 146 percent increase in june sales 
melville does not report samestore sales 
montgomery ward amp co said its june sales increased 66 percent 
overall and 64 percent on a samestore basis 
fw woolworth co said its domestic sales increased 82 percent 
in june while its samestore sales rose 36 percent

duracell inc is recalling two models of 
lithium camera batteries because of an assembly defect that can 
cause severe overheating and in some cases damage cameras company 
officials said 
the batteries affected by the recall include all duracell xl 
lithium camera batteries with the model number dl123a or dl223a and 
labeled made in usa 
the dl123a is a threevolt specialty battery while the dl223a is 
a sixvolt specialty battery both are used almost exclusively in 
35mm automatic cameras 
jim donahue a duracell spokesman said thursday that the 
overheating only occurred in eight out of an estimated 8 million 
batteries but that the company decided to take the conservative 
step and alert customers 
while no injuries have resulted from the defect in some cases a 
cameras battery compartment was melted donahue said 
the defect now corrected occurred during assembly when the 
anotab the metal strip that conducts the charge from the positive 
terminal to the negative terminal became bent donahue said once 
inside the camera the defect could cause an internal short in the 
battery leading it to overheat he said 
donahue said the defect had nothing to do with the companys 
other business the two models in question make up about 1 percent 
of duracells current sales volume and costs associated with the 
recall are to have no significant effect on duracell he said 
donahue said the batteries are used in 35mm cameras that have 
automatic rewind and autoadvance he said they tend to be newer 
models and are rarely used in cameras more than three or four years 
old 
duracell is asking consumers who are using the dl123a and dl223a 
batteries with the made in usa label to throw away their 
batteries in an outdoor trash receptacle they should then contact 
the company giving their name and address and they will receive 
free replacement batteries

the accounting firms deloitte haskins amp sells and touche ross amp 
co have agreed in principle to join forces while two larger big 
eight firms confirmed that they had entered into merger negotiations 
subject to the approval of partners at deloitte and touche ross 
the combined company would have worldwide revenue exceeding 4 
billion and employ over 65000 people in 101 countries it will be 
known as deloitte amp touche in the united states the firms said in a 
statement thursday 
separately arthur andersen amp co and price waterhouse confirmed 
reports that they had begun talks about a possible merger of their 
worldwide operations a confidentiality agreement will be in effect 
for the next 60 days while the proposition is being explored 
an andersenwaterhouse merger would create the worlds largest 
accounting firm reaping 5 billion a year in worldwide revenue and 
27 billion in us revenue 
the merger wave among the big eight firms began weeks ago with 
the announcement that ernst amp whinney and arthur young amp co agreed 
to combine their operations to create an accounting firm with 
worldwide revenue of 42 billion and domestic revenue of 2 billion 
although deloitte and touche ross are the smallest of the 
socalled big eight firms they have posted the most rapid growth in 
recent years between 1985 and 1988 their individual worldwide 
revenue jumped more than 88 percent according to bowmans 
accounting report an industry publication 
last year their worldwide growth averaged 26 percent compared 
with an average of 22 percent for the other big eight firms 
deloitte and touche ross noted their desire to serve 
multinational companies in todays global economy as a primary 
reason for the merger 
edward a kangas managing partner and chief executive of touche 
ross issued a statement saying a strong european capability is 
vital to serving our clients needs as the economic unification of 
europe in 1992 approaches 
deloitte chairman and chief executive officer j michael cook 
also pointed to the economic growth of the pacific rim as a need for 
a strengthened presence in asia the combined firm will draw on the 
expertise of the japanese audit firm tohmatsu awoki amp sanwa a 
member of the touche ross international organization 
worldwide the firm will be known as deloitte ross tohmatsu 
international 
kangas and cook will serve as chief executives of the 
international organization and the us firm respectively kangas 
also will serve as a managing partner of the us firm 
experts generally agreed that the merger makes sense 
particularly because the accounting industry has become increasingly 
specialized 
among deloittes audit clients are general motors 
kimberlyclark monsanto and procter amp gamble said arthur bowman 
publisher of the atlantabased bowmans accounting report 
touche rosss audit clients include american motors chrysler 
litton industries and pillsbury he said 
deloitte also displays its strength in the mergers and 
acquisitions arena bowman said the firm is a favorite of kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co the powerful new york investment firm 
kkr tapped deloitte to perform a number of accountingrelated 
services for its record 25 billion buyout of rjr nabisco as well as 
other targets including safeway and beatrice 
in a joint statement price waterhouse chairman joseph e connor 
and arthur andersen chief executive lawrence e weinbach said the 
the firms are seeking to benefit from the globalization of world 
economies accelerating technological changes and demand for new 
services and investments 
these developments are creating a demand for increased 
worldwide professional and financial resources which to serve 
clients needs their statement read 
arthur andersen is the secondlargest us accounting firm while 
price waterhouse ranks fifth 
together the two firms would audit almost 40 percent of the 
fortune 500 which could lead to federal trade commission concerns 
about a competitive imbalance bowman said 
the firms did not comment on whether any employees would be let 
go but observers suspect support staff will be cut 
they will definitely have to let people go at the support 
level the nonprofessional staffs bowman said and there will 
be some fallout at the partner level you dont need two partners in 
charge of the same little area 
but fees are unlikely to head lower despite savings from 
consolidation 
they cant lower the hourly rates that theyre charging so the 
only thing they can save on is administrative and certain overhead 
costs to help the bottom line said one accountant at a 
secondtier firm who asked not to be named

state farm mutual automobile insurance 
co says it will file a lawsuit challenging a nevada law that 
requires auto insurers to cut their rates 
well probably file the complaint by the end of next week or 
early in the week after that said dave hill a spokesman at the 
insurers headquarters in bloomington ill 
hill said thursday the company plans to challenge the law under 
the nevada and us constitutions on the grounds that the forced 
rollback violates the prohibition against taking property without 
due process 
the law requires insurers to cut their rates to 15 percent below 
the levels of july 1 1988 on new or renewed policies starting in 
october 
gov bob miller who signed the rollback into law thursday has 
said hes uncertain about the measures constitutionality but he 
said nevadans who support a rate rollback deserve a chance to have 
the state defend their position in court 
the law allows insurance companies to raise rates only if they 
prove to the state insurance commissioner that they would go 
bankrupt without an increase 
nevada has the fifthhighest auto insurance rates in the nation 
with drivers paying average annual premiums of 880 according to 
the state insurance division 
the american insurance association has said it also planned to 
challenge the rollback in court 
jeff beyer a spokesman for farmers insurance group inc one of 
nevadas largest auto insurers said the company hasnt decided 
whether to challenge the rollback 
he said a similar bankruptcy test in californias proposition 103 
insurance rollback was ruled unconstitutional by that states 
supreme court on the grounds it denied insurers a fair return on 
their investment 
farmers is as concerned as anybody about containing the cost of 
auto insurance in nevada but this is simply not a workable way to 
solve the problem beyer said in a telephone interview from 
farmers los angeles headquarters 
you cant roll back prices by fiat without doing something 
about the underlying costs

sparing former stockbroker boyd l jefferies a 
prison sentence could send the wrong message to future wall street 
felons break the law and you wont do time some legal experts say 
but others maintain that jefferies who admitted to two felony 
violations of federal securities laws has more than paid his price 
by cooperating with government investigators and quitting the los 
angeles brokerage that bears his name 
jefferies 58 who gave the government crucial information 
leading to three indictments and one conviction was sentenced 
thursday by a federal judge to five years of probation and fined 
250000 
the sentence was only the second in the wall street corruption 
scandal triggered by infamous stock speculator ivan f boesky who 
was sentenced by the same judge to three years in prison 
i think the public will view this as a slap on the wrist 
said alan bromberg a securities law professor at southern methodist 
university i think the dividing line in the mind of the public is 
hard time or no hard time 
the 250000 would be a lot of money for most people but i 
suspect its not going to put jefferies into bankruptcy court he 
added so the bottom line is nothing very serious happened to 
him 
but several securities defense lawyers including former 
prosecutors said the term was appropriate for many of the same 
reasons cited by us district judge morris lasker in his sentencing 
lasker told a packed courtroom that he suspended imposition of 
any jail term which could change if jefferies violates probation 
in large part because of jefferies cooperation with prosecutors 
he also said that the violations to which jefferies admitted were 
not as serious as boeskys insider trading admissions and had never 
been prosecuted criminally at the time of jefferies transgressions 
in 1985 and 1986 
the violations he pleaded to while i wouldnt said they were 
technical they certainly had not previously been the subject of 
criminal investigation said securities lawyer john f olson who 
has reviewed insider trading legislation for the american bar 
association 
in addition jefferies did not profit personally from the schemes 
in which admitted a role helping boesky conceal ownership of 56 
million in stock and filing a phony 3 million invoice to cover 
losses and helping speculator salim b lewis manipulate the stock 
price of firemans fund corp 
basically he was accommodating customers and thats a 
mitigating factor said sam scott miller a new york securities 
lawyer it doesnt make it ok but it puts you in a different 
category than some of the culprits 
boyd jefferies was not ivan boesky added miller who 
represented a company that owned the jefferies amp co brokerage in 
the early 1970s boyd may have crowded the line and wandered over 
it when he shouldnt have but id call ivan a hardcore offender 
boeskys threeyear sentence should serve as the benchmark for 
other cases in which defendants reach plea agreements lawyers said 
because the degree of his crimes was so severe boesky is the 
crook of the century said one defense lawyer involved in a 
prominent fraud case speaking anonymously 
boesky paid 100 million to the securities and exchange 
commission and pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing false 
information with the sec to settle wideranging charges that he used 
illegally obtained inside information to trade on the stocks of 
potential takeover targets 
jefferies who was implicated by boesky already has taken the 
stand at two mistrials in the gaf corp stock manipulation case and 
the stock fraud trial of corporate raider and former singer co 
chairman paul a bilzerian who was convicted last month he is to 
testify at the third gaf trial and the lewis trail in the fall 
while praising jefferies as a model of cooperation lasker chided 
absurd and probably obscene wall street greed and said his 
sentence shouldnt be interpreted as weak 
it would be a great mistake if those of you in the audience 
assumed that what mr jefferies has been through is easy and 
therefore not much of a penalty the judge said

the european community expressed anger 
after the united states ruled that the trading blocs subsidy 
program for oilseed farmers hurt american exporters 
we are very much concerned about this said nico wegter a 
spokesman for the 12nation trade alliance 
wegter said thursday that the community intended to ask the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade for consultations over the 
latest in a series of agricultural clashes between the giant trading 
partners the 96nation gatt is a forum for removing barriers to 
world trade 
carla hills the us trade representative on wednesday issued a 
ruling that the communitys production and processing subsidies on 
oilseeds and animal feed proteins were unjustifiable and 
unreasonable and they burden or restrict us commerce 
she delayed until the end of january taking any punitive actions 
in the case 
the dispute stems from a complaint filed in december 1987 by the 
american soybean association which alleged the community subsidies 
had sharply cut into american exports to europe 
the association argued that the common market payments encouraged 
farmers to grow oilseeds which then reduced the demand for american 
imports the group contended us soybean exports fell to 2 billion 
in 1986 from 36 billion in 1981 
the common market has argued that the erosion of the european 
market was largely due to increases in cheaper imports from brazil 
and argentina 
in may gatt set up an impartial panel to determine whether the 
subsidies amounted to unfair trade practices under international 
rules the panel held its first meeting on june 27 and was expected 
to issue its findings in early january 
mrs hills decision to rule in the case while the gatt panel was 
conducting its investigating was criticized by the common market 
it is in our view contradictory said wegter 
he reiterated the common markets contention that the subsidy 
program did not constitute an unfair trade practice 
our production is kept under strict control he said the 
prices have gone down and it is in no way affecting imports by the 
americans 
the community provides costly subsidies to its farmers through 
guaranteed prices for many of their crops it also gives exporters 
help so more expensive european farm products can compete with lower 
prices on the world market 
the united states complains the export subsidies have helped the 
community increase its share of the world market

a plan worked out by strikehobbled eastern 
airlines and travel agents for refunding unused tickets has won the 
approval of a federal bankruptcy judge 
the plan ties the refunds to future ticket sales by the agents 
at a court hearing thursday us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland approved the plan agreed to by eastern its major creditors 
and the american society of travel agents 
the travel agent group earlier had petitioned the bankruptcy 
court to require eastern to pay refunds on unused tickets to travel 
agents who would pass the refunds on to their customers 
miamibased eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors 
on march 9 five days after the start of a crippling strike by the 
machinists union that was joined by pilots and flights attendants 
at that time the airline said its debts included about 165 million 
in unused tickets issued before the bankruptcy filing 
that amount has since been reduced to about 80 million eastern 
spokesman robin matell said thursday 
eastern estimates it sells 75 percent of its tickets through 
travel agents 
under easterns existing policy travelers who paid cash for 
unused tickets must apply directly to eastern or to bankruptcy court 
as creditors those who bought tickets by credit card can apply for 
refunds from the card issuer 
alternatively customers can use their tickets to fly eastern 
where available or sister carrier continental airlines although 
airlines generally honor each others tickets competitors stopped 
honoring eastern tickets after it filed for bankruptcy protection 
under the new plan effective today travel agents will be 
reimbursed for ticket refunds they gave their customers the total 
amount of refund money available will be based on the volume of new 
eastern tickets sold by the agents 
eastern will put 5 million into the reimbursement fund up front 
in addition for the rest of july eastern will pay into the fund 
each week the total amount of agents sales of eastern tickets that 
exceeds 36 million up to a maximum of 125 million a week 
in august the cap on the amount that could go into the fund each 
week will increase to 2 million a maximum of 20 million could be 
put into the fund from ticket sales during the life of the program 
the pilots union at eastern blasted the agreement calling it 
nothing short of the blackmail of travel agents who are creditors 
in the eastern bankruptcy 
in a statement the union said the agents are in effect 
required to sell eastern tickets in order to make sure they can 
collect the money eastern owes them 
in addition the pilots said the plan makes no provision for 
customers who purchased their eastern tickets directly rather than 
through a travel agent

airline reservation switchboards are lighting up 
like fireworks this week as thousands of travelers take advantage of 
bargain air fares that were sparked by the midweek july 4 holiday 
airline officials say 
continental airlines ignited the independence day fare war with 
its spirit of 76 ticket prices 76 one way almost anywhere 
the airline flies in the continental united states 
rivals that matched the fare and those that upped the ante 
reported the priceslashing lit a fire under air travelers looking 
for bargains 
the special fares are designed to drum up business during the 
slack midweek holiday travel period airline officials said 
traditionally when you see a holiday falling in midweek 
business travelers decide not to travel that week that is the case 
this week but this is winwin situation said ned walker a 
continental spokesman at the airlines houston headquarters 
after continental announced its low fares sunday braniff airways 
matched the offer the next day bookings at braniff on monday broke 
the airlines oneday record by about 40 percent said spokesman don 
mcguire 
the holiday weekend was extremely strong the public response 
has been beautiful he said in a telephone interview from braniff 
headquarters in orlando fla 
united airlines and american airlines also matched the cutrate 
fares 
tickets for most of the special fares must be purchased by 
saturday and travel must start by that day the fares require a 
roundtrip purchase and carry other restrictions 
most industry observers said the holiday discounts are nothing 
new and amounted to an excuse to advertise but one analyst said 
braniffs program has a different intent 
it is a typical action by an airline that is perhaps a little 
tight on cash said robert j joedicke an analyst at shearson 
lehman hutton inc it is an attempt to sell fares now in order to 
get working capital 
the discounts are not part of a longterm trend toward lower 
airline fares he said 
the truth is discounted fares are harder and harder to find 
said joedicke 
joedicke said continentals 76 fare offered for such a short 
period wouldnt make much of a difference in the airlines revenue 
figures 
but walker said response to continentals holiday fares was so 
great that the airline added several thousand additional seats for 
the program 
we are selling seat inventory that might otherwise go unsold 
and the american consumers get a bargain they havent seen in 
years he said 
following continentals lead american airlines adopted a 152 
roundtrip fare which applies to any of the 111 markets it serves 
in the 48 contiguous states 
the dallasbased airline also reported its best oneday traffic 
period ever last friday when it flew 27684 million revenue 
passenger miles with an 835 percent load factor officials said 
we had extremely full flights anyway before the fare was 
announced said american spokesman jim brown 
uniteds similar fares extend to all cities it serves in the 48 
states said spokeswoman sara dornacker at the airlines chicago 
headquarters 
they are selling extremely well we are having an extremely 
higher period of bookings than we had last year she said 
as a result of existing higher demand atlantabased delta air 
lines decided not to match the other fares 
we looked at our loads for those days and they were high 
said delta spokesman jim lundy so we were looking at diluting 
revenue we already had on the books

time inc lawyers have charged paramount 
communications inc with trying to deceive the federal 
communications commission about how long it would take paramount to 
complete its 122 billion hostile bid for time 
the media giants attorneys in a letter to fcc mass media bureau 
chief alex d felker released to the media thursday accused 
paramount of making false statements in applications for approval of 
former defense secretary donald rumsfeld as a voting trustee to hold 
time stock 
time is fighting paramounts 200ashare bid while trying to 
preserve a planned merger with warner communications inc 
times lawyers charged that although paramount told the fcc it 
expected its original 107 billion bid to expire july 5 paramount 
executives knew before their offer was announced that it could not 
close for several months because it is conditioned upon obtaining 
regulatory approval to operate about 800 cable television systems 
that time owns the offer is now scheduled to expire july 28 
paramount called the charges a delaying tactic 
time continues frantically to try to block our 200ashare 
tender offer the only real issue in this whole matter by raising 
questions on timing paramount said in a statement 
of course it might take a few months to get the approvals 
the statement continued our process is well under way 
paramount released a letter from its own attorneys responding to 
queries from the fcc the letter also addressed to felker said 
paramount expects it will take a few months to obtain the cable 
approvals 
at issue is paramounts request for special temporary approval 
for rumsfeld who would hold time stock after the conclusion of 
paramounts tender offer and while paramount awaits approval for the 
transfer of licenses for microwave relay systems operated by times 
cable tv subsidiary american television amp communications corp 
the fcc has jurisdiction over the transfer of the relay 
facilities 
times attorneys claimed in their letter that because of 
misrepresentations by paramount it would be against the public 
interest for the fcc to grant paramounts requests 
along with the letter time released parts of depositions given 
by paramount executives in one deposition paramounts chief 
financial officer michael hope said he did not believe company 
officials gave paramounts board any reason to believe that that 
july 5 would be a realistic date to expect to close this 
transaction 
paramount criticized time for releasing only parts of the 
depositions the whole record should be available in this case 
with a few minor exceptions the company said time only wants 
to open up for public inspection those carefully selected areas of 
the record they think are useful to them 
while time and paramount quarreled over the trustee the primary 
issue in the struggle is before delaware chancery court which will 
decide whether time in agreeing to merge with warner earlier this 
year in effect put itself up for sale 
if the court rules that time did in fact put itself on the block 
the media giants board must give serious consideration to the 
parmount offer which time directors rejected as financially 
inadequate and too conditional 
a hearing is set for tuesday 
in another courtroom this one in stamford conn arguments were 
heard thursday in a suit brought by times atc subsidiary that seeks 
an injunction to stall the paramount bid 
paramount attorney john l warden charged atc sought the 
injunction merely to keep in place times management which has 
negotiated extremely lucrative contracts for the next decade 
but atc attorney james stapleton denied the charge saying 
were not trying to stop the tender offer he said paramount 
officials were interested only in time and they dont care about 
atc 
atc the nations secondlargest cable company with more than 4 
million customers wants paramount to obtain approval as a cable 
television franchise owner before proceeding with a takeover 
the time subsidiary said contracts for 200 of its franchises 
require regulatory approval of a new parent company before the new 
parent company assumes control 
atc contends it could be stripped of the 200 franchises if 
paramount fails to gain prior approval of its takeover bid 
on wall street thursday time stock rose 37 cents a share to 
close at 15562 paramount fell 150 to 5787 a share and 
warner picked up 50 cents to close at 6175 a share

the chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee says venezuelas investigation of a foreignexchange 
scandal is causing some us corporations to reexamine their 
investments in the country and to withdraw top executives 
chairman dante fascell dfla in a letter to venezuelas 
ambassador in washington said at a time when economic growth is 
a priority it would be a shame to see foreign corporations 
discouraged from investing in venezuela or decide to curtail their 
operations 
i do not wish to interfere in any way in domestic affairs or in 
the judicial system in venezuela nor can i comment on the merits of 
the case fascell said in his june 13 letter to ambassador simon 
consalvi 
as a friend of venezuela however i do wish to bring to your 
attention the problems this case is causing for foreign business 
he said some american corporations have removed their top 
executives and are reexamining their investments in your country 
fascell said that he has been told by executives of major 
american corporations that a venezuelan judge has issued arrest 
warrants for several people including american executives on 
charges of fraud in obtaining preferential foreign exchange 
i understand the charges involved do not permit those accused 
to be granted bail fascell said the executives involved claim 
they and their corporations are innocent 
replying ambassador consalvi said his government does not 
welcome any discouragement to the presence of foreign businesses and 
investment and in fact welcomes them 
but he said the government operating under a system of 
separation of powers respects the independence of the judicial 
system 
he also noted that venezuela acted in march to abolish the 
multiple exchange rate system 
investigators in venezuela have been examining allegations that 
billions of dollars in illegal profits were skimmed from a now 
disbanded office set up to distribute us dollars at favorable 
exchange rates for essential imports 
the investigators have been quoted in published reports as saying 
that some 24 billion of the 30 billion involved may have been 
touched by fraud

detroit car buyers who resisted the incentives of this spring 
and summer may have their patience rewarded during the next few 
weeks the scenario theyve been waiting for high rebates and low 
interest rates may be on its way 
the prime rate has dropped recently and there have been 
indications that other interest rates including those for cars 
will fall 
i think theres no question that the direction of interest 
rates is downward donald ratajczak of the economic forecasting 
center at georgia state university in atlanta said thursday 
the incentives which have been around since april are likely to 
stay through the end of the model year this fall because they 
apparently havent done the trick 
earlier this week the eight major vehicle manufacturers with 
domestic plants reported their car and light truck sales for the 
first half of 1989 were 48 percent behind the sales pace during the 
same time last year 
that could prompt automakers to add more incentives or beef up 
existing ones to move out 1989 models and clear dealer lots for the 
1990s which officially debut oct 1 analysts say 
its an incredibly good buying time said auto analyst john 
kirnan of kidder peabody amp co inc 
however he added the industry is going to be very hard 
pressed to turn the spigot on for the third quarter youve got the 
greatest levels of incentives out there and they dont seem to be 
generating the interest 
bill meier general manager of ray green chevrolet in 
jacksonville ill agreed 
its been slow and its beginning to taper off he said 
thursday 
manufacturers and dealers are wrestling with high inventory 
levels estimated by some to be as much as 80 days worth of stock 
at the current selling rate 
my guess is that the industry had 76 days worth of cars at 
the end of june with the big three at 78 to 80 days said analyst 
david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york its not a 
disaster but its uncomfortably high a year ago you were looking 
at 60 61 or 62 days 
one way to deflate inventory is to close production drying up 
the supply of cars coming into the retail sales pipeline that in 
turn forces layoffs 
a united auto workers spokesman declining to be identified said 
the union was monitoring the sales and production figures closely to 
be sure that any layoffs are allowed under contracts with the big 
three 
selective plant production cuts began several months ago this 
week and the next kick off the traditional summer vacation and 
modelchangeover time as factories are prepared for the next model 
year ford motor co has no production scheduled during that time 
on thursday wards automotive reports said domestic automakers 
production levels were sharply lower this week compared with the 
same week a year ago the trade journal said automakers scheduled 
the production of 71167 cars and trucks in the united states this 
week 426 percent fewer than the 124029 vehicles they produced 
during the same week last year

whether or not the first jury verdict against 
hoffmannla roche incs accutane acne medicine leads to more 
lawsuits will probably be irrelevant to the billiondollar drug 
company analysts say 
there is nothing that can happen to hoffmannla roche as a 
result of this situation said calvert crary a litigation analyst 
at labe simpson amp co inc in new york 
last week a federal jury in mississippi agreed with the claim by 
mary kathryn thomas that the acne medicine sent her to the hospital 
with bouts of disorientation seizures and eventually comas that 
lasted several days 
the jury awarded ms thomas 59 1 million 
even if hundreds of people began filing such lawsuits it would 
be a matter of utterly no consequence to the nutley njbased 
drug maker said crary 
in a way i suppose you could say thats whats so sick about 
the whole system but thats the system he said 
the powerful drug a highly effective medicine for a severe and 
scarring form of acne has been linked to 73 cases of birth defects 
its potential side effects include skin dryness vomiting nausea 
headaches and visual disturbances 
a jury in aberdeen miss found that the company failed to warn 
ms thomass doctor adequately about accutanes potential side 
effects when it was prescribed in 1984 ms thomas at the time lived 
in columbus miss and now lives outside orlando fla 
theyre not emphasizing just how toxic this drug is said ms 
thomass attorney john owens of tuscaloosa ala 
we feel the verdict is wrong that its inappropriate said 
company spokeswoman carolyn glynn hoffmannla roche the us 
subsidiary of swiss pharmaceutical giant f hoffmannla roche amp co 
is considering an appeal among other options she said ms glynn 
would not comment on what those might be 
accutane is not a proven cause of the seizures but the company 
in 1985 included warnings indicating that such seizures have been 
reported in accutane users she said 
analysts discounted the lawsuit avalanche common to the asbestos 
industry the dalkon shield or even to a lesser degree cigarette 
makers who despite last years first jury loss face fewer product 
liability suits 
there just arent enough potential plaintiffs said karl 
habermas a pharmaceutical analyst with sanford c bernstein inc of 
new york 
im sure this will induce others to file suit and encourage 
those who have but i dont think there are that many people who 
have been injured by the product he said 
hoffmannla roche has yearly us sales of 19 billion accutane 
accounts for only about 45 million to 50 million said ms glynn 
since the prescription drugs introduction in 1982 14 million to 
15 million people are estimated to have used it she said 
insurance covers jury awards and even without it future cases 
would be financially insignificant crary said 
ms glynn said 30 to 35 accutane cases are pending and a 
somewhat greater number have been settled thrown out of court or 
won by the company

additional inspections of older boeing 727s may be 
ordered now that airlines have found cracks on four of the planes 
according to a federal aviation administration spokesman 
the faa ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47 
oldest 727s after united airlines reported it found a 20inch crack 
in one of its airplanes during a routine maintenance check june 26 
a united spokesman said thursday that tiny cracks have also been 
found on two other planes 
american airlines found a small crack on one plane the seattle 
postintelligencer reported today 
the faa deadline for completing the inspections is july 15 it 
was not known how many planes had been checked so far faa spokesman 
dave duff said 
he said that checks might be required on 405 other older 727 
aircraft built during the early 1960s because of manufacturing 
processes used at the time the postintelligencer reported 
we anticipate that we will do further airworthiness 
directives he said 
united spokesman rob doughty said two of the three united planes 
found with cracks have been repaired and are back in service and the 
third will be flying shortly 
the faas airworthiness directive sent by telegram last friday 
to 727 operators said preliminary indications are that the 
cracking was caused by fatigue 
boeing co engineers are trying to discover why the 25yearold 
united jet developed the 20inch crack in a part of its fuselage 
that hasnt been associated with high stress 
the crack was in the same general area as the rupture in an aloha 
airlines 737 that lost part of its top over hawaii last year but 
both boeing and the faa said the cracking appeared entirely 
different from that in the aloha plane 
this is a unique situation said faa spokesman duff in 
seattle this is the first time a report of cracking has been made 
in this area 
duff added the cracking was not typical of the type often found 
in older aircraft 
if not corrected the cracks in the fuselage skin could result in 
rapid decompression of the plane in flight the faa said 
duff said thursday that faa officials suspect hoop tension 
fatigue caused by outward forces against the hull in pressurized 
flight the different thicknesses of aircraft skin at the overlap 
also could be a factor he said 
the cracked segment was brought to boeing laboratories in seattle 
where engineers were trying to find why it occurred said boeing 
commercial airplanes spokesman tom cole that analysis probably will 
take several days he said 
the threeengine 727 which boeing built from 1962 to 1984 was 
the bestselling commercial jet before being surpassed by the boeing 
737 cole said 1765 727s are still in service including 41 of the 
47 planes covered by the faa order 
the april 28 1988 aloha accident in which a stewardess fell to 
her death before the flight crew could land the badly damaged plane 
focused worldwide attention on aging aircraft the 19yearold plane 
was one of the most heavily used 737s with nearly 90000 landings 
the national transportation safety board said the probable cause 
of the accident was the failure of alohas maintenance workers to 
detect significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the skin of 
the twinengine jet 
the crack in the united 727 was found where sections of skin 
overlap on the lefthand side of the plane ahead of the wings and 
below the windows duff said 
the faa order required the removal of some seats sidewall 
linings and insulation to gain access to the inside of the fuselage 
skin cole said the inspection normally could be accomplished by 
several maintenance workers in an overnight check he said 
inspections were ordered only for the 47 oldest 727s because the 
inner layer of aluminum skin was made thicker on later models cole 
said 
he said boeings decision to use the heaviergauge skin was for 
costcontrol not because the skin was too thin

the government is ordering airlines to install 
expensive bomb detectors at 40 american and foreign airports but 
officials say it will take two to three years to put them all in 
place 
transportation secretary samuel skinner on thursday announced 
draft federal aviation administration rules requiring the devices 
capable of detecting plastic explosives in checked luggage 
the order is one of several steps taken in response to the dec 
21 bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland that killed 270 
people investigators concluded the bomb was a plastic device hidden 
in luggage although they have not determined who planted it 
screening devices currently used at airports cannot detect such 
plastic explosives 
the faa said installation would be as fast as manufacturers can 
produce the detectors some airports will need more than one device 
and installation at the first 40 airports is expected to take two to 
three years said faa spokesman john leyden 
the agency did not list all of the facilities but said 
international airports in new york and london would be the firast to 
get the devices 
congress has been considering legislation that would have the 
government pay for the units which cost from 750000 to 1 million 
each 
airlines say the government should pay for such extraordinary 
security since the terrorist threat is aimed against the united 
states not the airlines 
the faa in making the rule that will become final at the end of 
august also called for comment on whether the order should be 
extended to all domestic airports 
the busiest us international airports and some major facilities 
used by us carriers abroad are the first to be covered 
the faa said the first device will be installed at new yorks 
john f kennedy international airport by the end of the month a 
second is to be placed at londons gatwick airport the faa said 
those and four others at unannounced airports are being paid for by 
the faa to test how the devices will be used leyden said 
the rule does not mandate a specific device but only one has so 
far been approved by the faa the thermal neutron analysis unit 
manufactured by science applications international corp of san 
diego calif 
skinner said the tna device has been shown to have the highest 
degree of explosive detection currently possible for detecting known 
civilian and military explosives manufactured here and abroad 
any system that qualifies the faa said would have to be 
automated be capable of detecting defined quantities and 
configurations of particular explosives and be safe for operators 
and baggage 
the tna units are not designed for use on passengers or 
handcarried bags they bombard luggage with lowenergy neutrons 
that interact with chemical elements in explosives triggering an 
alarm when a bomb is present 
human monitoring is not required but leyden said details have to 
be worked out on what procedures will be followed after an alarm is 
triggered

last month came in the service sector and the government revised 
its may jobgrowth total to 207000 more than double the total 
given in a preliminary report last month 
there were clear signs in the report of a slowing economy and an 
indication as well of an easing of wage inflation that has troubled 
some analysts 
the labor department said the average factory work week slipped 
01 of an hour to 409 hours last month the first time this 
indicator has fallen below 41 hours since september 1987 
average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers 
were essentially unchanged for the first five months of the year 
hourly wages had grown on average by 03 percent 
many economists had expected an upward revision of the may 
payroll expansion totals but the 180000 figure for june was below 
most predictions still it was likely not low enough to raise fears 
that the economy has slowed to the verge of recession 
on balance id say its another sign of a weakening economy 
merrill lynch analyst bruce steinberg said of the unemployment 
report the slowdown in the industrial sector is becoming more 
pronounced 
for the past four months business added an average of just below 
200000 jobs a month well below the average monthly gain of the 
past year 
the june unemployment report the first comprehensive look at 
economic activity last month showed that the service sector 
continues as the source of the overwhelming number of new jobs while 
manufacturing continues to struggle 
serviceproducing industries added 231000 new jobs last month 
with business and health services and wholesale and retail trade all 
posting modest gains 
some of that growth was offset however by a decline of 31000 
manufacturing jobs and 8000 construction jobs despite the summer 
weather 
those figures are gleaned from the labor departments monthly 
survey of businesses 
the departments separate household survey used to set the 
unemployment rate found that the civilian labor force grew by 
492000 people from may to june to a total of 1241 million 
of that group 1175 million held jobs and 65 million were 
looking for work but could not find it 
steinberg of merrill lynch attributed the servicesector growth 
mainly to summer jobs for students 
he said it appeared that federal reserve policymakers had eased 
monetary policy again thursday for the second time in recent weeks 
and he said there was nothing in todays report to change the 
central banks new stance which comes after months of keeping a 
tight hold on credit in hopes of curbing growth and taming inflation 
the fed has apparently shifted gears now and it views the risk 
of a recession as more pronounced than the risk of inflation 
steinberg said 
among most demographic groups the unemployment rate was 
unchanged or up just slightly although increases in joblessness 
were reported for teenagers in general and black female teenagers 
in particular the rate for the latter group shot up from 28 percent 
in may to more than 40 percent last month 
among all teenagers the unemployment rate rose from 152 percent 
to 156 percent that came as the labor force for that age group 
grew by more than 100000 apparently due to an influx of students 
into the summer labor market 
the government said blacks made up the bulk of the new teenagers 
in the labor force in contrast to young black women male black 
teenagers had some success in finding jobs as their unemployment 
rate fell more than three percentage points to a stillhigh 335 
percent 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that includes military 
personnel based in the united states the jobless rate climbed to 
52 percent in june from 51 percent in may 
the civilian jobless rate has been hovering in the 5 percent 
range for more than a year it was 54 percent in june 1988 and fell 
to a more than 15year low of 50 percent in march before heading 
upward 
in its analysis of the report the bureau of labor statistics 
made no mention of a number of factors economists said could skew 
the june data primarily a quarterly blip in the period between the 
surveys used to compile the report 
the labor department conducts the surveys in the week of the 
month that includes the 12th those weeks usually fall four weeks 
apart but four times a year including last month they come five 
weeks apart

bond prices rallied to a twoyear high during the 
second quarter of the year but economists and analysts say they 
arent optimistic about the streak continuing through the rest of 
the year 
our feeling is that the bond market has overreacted said 
kathleen cooper chief economist for security pacific national bank 
in los angeles it tends to get carried away at times i think 
this was one of those times 
the market rally began in late march and continued through most 
of the apriljune quarter pulling the yield on the bellwether 
30year treasury bond from about 930 percent in late march to 803 
percent on june 30 bond prices move in the opposite direction from 
yields 
ms cooper believes there will be a correction in which bond 
prices will fall more in line with actual economic conditions 
she says bond traders expected the economic slowdown to be 
greater than she predicts it actually will be a slower economy is 
good for bonds because it usually eases inflation which erodes the 
value of fixedreturn investments such as bonds 
ms cooper also believes bond traders expect the federal reserve 
board will ease monetary policy more than she thinks it actually 
will the fed encourages an increase in the supply of money to 
stimulate the economy when it senses a downturn more money usually 
translates into lower interest rates which boost bond prices 
elliott platt chief economist for donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities corp believes the bond rally has a few more months of 
steam left but the bulk of the rally is behind us 
he predicts the bond market would remain bullish through the 
current quarter because of continuing signs that the economy is 
slowing which eases inflation 
i think the long bond the 30year treasury is going to 
challenge and for a brief period break through the 8 percent mark 
he said last week 
but by year end he predicts the 30year treasury will be 
yielding 850 percent ms cooper was slightly more bullish 
predicting the long bond would yield 825 percent by the end of the 
year 
working in favor of bond prices in the next six months experts 
predict will be an easing of monetary policy by the fed slower 
economic growth and slower growth in the rate of inflation 
working against the market could be a depreciation in the dollar 
which could blunt the fall in inflation and limit incentives for 
foreign investors to buy us bonds which in turn would lower 
demand for the securities and soften their prices 
james kochan chief fixedincome strategist for merrill lynch amp 
co inc credits technical factors in part for this springs 
rally 
those factors he said were the popularity of zerocoupon 
treasury bonds and longmaturity municipal bonds as the supply of 
these bonds was depleted due to the demand their prices rose said 
kochan 
zerocoupon bonds lack the interestbearing portion of regular 
bonds demand for the zeros increased in the marchapril period as 
reports indicated the economy was slowing kochan said a similar 
increase in demand for longmaturity municipal bonds also pushed up 
their price he said 
since then demand for treasury zeros and long municipals has 
weakened kochan said while the supply of these securities has 
increased eliminating this as a factor in the bond market 
but kochan is more optimistic about the markets performance 
during the second half than platt and ms cooper he predicts the 
30year treasury bond will yield 775 percent by the end of the year 
as to where individual investors should put their money kochan 
recommends municipal bonds with maturities of 10 years or more as 
well as municipal zerocoupon bonds in this maturity range he also 
suggests mortgagebacked securities 
platt cautions investors who missed the bond rally to be 
disciplined and resigned to the fact that they missed 
he believes investors should avoid jumping into the longmaturity 
bond market with expectations of continued price gains instead he 
said they should buy shorterduration issues which would benefit 
more if the fed eases monetary policy

a coal company whose contract with the 
united mine workers includes a nostrike clause has fired 28 wildcat 
strikers who refused to return to work the first firings of the 
fourweek wildcat walkout officials said today 
the company couldnt hold a formal hearing on the firings late 
this morning in beckley because 2000 umw members blocked a meeting 
hall representatives of toneys branch coal co and the umw refused 
to cross a picket line that surrounded the raleigh county armory 
dismissal forms given the workers said they were fired for 
refusing to cross pickets at toneys branchs mine in racine the 
delay in the formal hearing does not mean the firings are postponed 
this should tell them that all its going to do is incite the 
workers umw international executive board member howard green 
said in a telephone interview from beckley 
earlier officials at toneys branch headquarters in beckley 
refused to comment on the dismissals beyond saying the company was a 
member of the bituminous coal operators association which in 
february 1988 signed a umw contract that included a nostrike 
clause a coal industry manual says there are 56 employees at the 
toney branchs racine mine but does not specify how many are umw 
members 
the dismissals are the first during a fourweek wildcat sympathy 
strike by umw members backing colleagues at the pittston co who 
have been on strike since april pittston unlike most other coal 
companies has no contract with the umw and the union has 
sanctioned that strike but not the wildcat walkout at other 
companies 
as many as 46000 miners in 10 states have stayed off the job at 
one time or another since the unauthorized walkouts began june 12 
today about 37000 miners in eight states were off their jobs 
a twoweek vacation period for many miners ends at midnight 
sunday and several locals have discussed or plan to consider 
returning to work fearing what happened to the toneys branch 
miners 
some of them think if this goes down the drain miners might be 
in bad shape they coal companies might bust the union said 
charlie greer the president of a umw local that represents 
zanesville ohioarea miners 
us sen robert byrd said thursday he wanted labor secretary 
elizabeth dole to step in and help end the strikes 
byrd dwva said dole should ask umw president richard trumka 
and pittston chairman paul douglas to settle their organizations 
differences so that 1900 striking pittston miners can return to 
work 
the union and the company havent been at the bargaining table 
for several weeks now

high voltage engineering corp which has been 
pursuing milwaukeebased universal foods corp since last year 
announced today it was willing to raise its offer to 42 a share 
laurence levy chairman of high voltage based in burlington 
mass said his company delivered a letter to universals board of 
directors offering to buy the company in a negotiated transaction 
we are attempting to negotiate with them because we think that 
is a better route said evan zeppos a spokesman for high voltage 
in milwaukee 
high voltage currently has a 38 per share cash tender offer for 
universal but only about 30 percent of the stockholders have 
tendered their shares according to a statement last week from 
universal 
we remain committed to the acquisition of universal the 
letter from high voltage said we would like to meet with you at 
your earliest convenience to complete the negotiation of the merger 
agreement 
a universal spokeswoman said the company had no immediate 
response to the offer 
high voltage began its quest for universal last december with an 
offer of 3050 per share the proposal however has been rejected 
by universals board of directors 
high voltage challenged an antitakeover law in wisconsin that 
essentially blocks bidders from making direct contact with 
shareholders unless the companys management approves 
the law was upheld this year by the 7th circuit us court of 
appeals in chicago although the decision stated wisconsins law 
may well be folly we are confident that it is constitutional 
in its letter to universal high voltage said the court noted 
that bidders could seek to require that directors fulfill their 
fiduciary obligations as they relate to the antitakeover 
statute 
i think they will find this offer very generous and it will 
force them to take a look at it zeppos said 
investment analysts said 42 per share which would amount to 
about 640 million would be a strong offer but they said the 
outcome was hard to predict 
i would hope the universal foods board would now initiate some 
sort of discussions said richard elam a food industry analyst 
with blunt ellis amp loewi inc in chicago 
clinton mayer an analyst with bear stearns amp co in new york 
said he did not foresee any quick resolution 
he noted that the smaller individual stockholders have been more 
reluctant to part with their shares than the larger institutional 
investors 
the stock seems to be held by conservative investors who dont 
seem concerned with shortterm prices mayer said

the government rested its case friday in the 
first securities racketeering trial after playing a tape of a former 
drexel burnham lambert inc trader telling a princetonnewport 
partners lp executive after an alleged illegal deal welcome to 
the world of being a sleaze 
also defense lawyers declined friday to crossexamine drexel 
chief executive frederick h joseph for fear of introducing into 
evidence potentially damaging information about drexels 650 
million plea deal with the government 
the sleaze tape was one of 14 conversations played by federal 
prosecutors at the closely watched wall street fraud trial of five 
partners in princetonnewport a defunct brokerage and exdrexel 
trader bruce lee newberg 
the tape involves charges that newberg told princetonnewport to 
sell blocks of stock in comb co to try to drive its share price 
below 16 in 1985 before a 25 million drexel bond offering to the 
minneapolisbased merchandiser 
i want you to you know get rid of it newberg told 
princetonnewport partner charles m zarzecki on april 11 1985 i 
want you to get it down to at least 15 at least and hopefully 
lower 
zarzecki later that day told newberg he sold 40000 shares of the 
stock through another party in an attempt to drive the price down 
newberg agreed uh that was good youre a sleaze bag 
zarzecki you taught me man hey listen turkey 
newberg welcome to the world of being a sleaze 
after playing the tape to the jury of nine women and three men 
prosecutors rested their case 
zarzeckis lawyer paul grand told us district judge robert l 
carter that certain charges against his client should be dismissed 
because combs stock never fell below 16 
grand said disclosure of the transaction was unnecessary because 
the stock was traded in the overthecounter market which is 
governed by different rules than major exchanges 
other defense lawyers asked carter to throw out a bevy of mail 
fraud wire fraud and racketeering charges the judge did not 
immediately rule on the requests but indicated he was uncertain 
about some of the governments charges 
the comb deal also played a major role in defense lawyers 
decision not to crossexamine joseph who took the stand thursday 
for the first time in a wall street corruption case 
under questioning from assistant us attorney mark hansen 
joseph described drexel compliance systems and practices for 
underwriting securities such as convertible bonds the kind used in 
the comb transaction 
defense lawyers said friday that crossexamining joseph in an 
attempt to show that the comb transactions were harmless could 
have opened the door for the government to introduce drexels 650 
settlement of securities law charges reached last december 
the government is barred from introducing the drexel deal as 
evidence because it is unrelated defense lawyers did not want to 
risk mentioning the deal because for fear it would have prejudiced 
the jury against princetonnewport 
one of six felony counts to which drexel has agreed to plead

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade reflecting an increased 
likelihood of rain in the midwest this weekend and late next week 
prices had opened higher on forecasts thursday for mostly hot and 
dry weather in the corn belt through next week but attitudes 
changed after some private meteorologists reported a weakening of 
the highpressure ridge that has prevented showers and cool 
temperatures from reaching the midwest this week 
i think people came in this morning feeling comfortable about 
buying the market and expecting higher prices next week but when 
the weathermen started adding precipitation they all lost their 
courage said steve freed a grainmarket analyst in chicago with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
weather concerns continue to dominate the grain and soybean 
markets as is the rule for the growing season 
this is a very nervous market said dale gustafson an 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
at the close of trading wheat was cent to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 404 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 5 cents lower with july at 272 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 4 cents lower with july at 157 a bushel soybeans were 
15 cents lower to 2 cents higher with july at 767 a bushel

the federal reserve faced with further signs 
of a weakening economy launched a second round of credit easing 
this week even before the end of a crucial midyear review of 
monetary policy private economists said friday 
the analysts predicted that the move would send a variety of 
consumer and business interest rates lower with one saying that a 
cut in commercial banks prime lending rate could come as early as 
monday 
the fed is easing and there is clear evidence that we have 
passed the peak on interest rates said david wyss an economist 
with drimcgraw hill an economic consulting firm in lexington mass 
the development was not unexpected although some economists were 
surprised that the move came even before the end of two days of 
meetings of the federal open market committee composed of members 
of the federal reserve board in washington and five of the 12 
regional fed bank presidents 
the committee meets eight times a year to map monetary strategy 
and many had expected that the central bank would begin another 
round of easing moves in the period following this weeks meeting 
at the previous meeting held on may 16 fed policymakers 
decided to leave credit conditions unchanged they noted a variety 
of economic statistics pointing to slower growth according to 
minutes of that meeting released friday 
the nochange decision was adopted on an 111 vote with 
thomas melzer president of the federal reserve bank of st louis 
dissenting melzer argued that unless the central bank eased 
immediately it ran the danger of increasing the possibility of a 
recession 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan will reveal details of 
this weeks discussions when he delivers the feds midyear 
assessment of the economy in congressional testimony on july 20 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said the fed is acting because a 
growing number of business barometers confirm that economic growth 
is slowing 
the labor department reported friday that the nations 
unemployment rate climbed to 53 percent in june reflecting 
continued declines in manufacturing and construction the uptick in 
the jobless rate follows other statistics showing weak auto sales a 
plunge in orders for manufactured goods and lackluster retail sales 
jones said he expected the looser credit environment would mean 
that banks will cut their prime lending rate perhaps as early as 
monday banks dropped the prime to its current 11 percent in early 
june the prime rate traditinally considered a benchmark for 
business loans now influences a variety of consumer loans 
including home equity loans 
economists based their belief that the fed is easing credit on a 
slight decline in the federal funds rate which edged down 025 
percent to 925 percent in the past two days 
the federal funds rate the interest that banks charge each other 
to make overnight loans is influenced by daily decisions the 
central bank makes on how much money to make available to the 
banking system it is considered the best earlywarning signal of 
fed intentions to loosen or tighten credit conditions 
the funds rate first dropped on thursday to the 925 percent 
level and it held at that lower level on friday convincing many 
economists that the central bank had eased it would mark the second 
move toward lower interest rates in recent weeks 
the funds rate had dropped from 975 percent to 95 percent in 
early june 
greenspan and the other members of the fed have been under 
pressure from congress and the administration to let interest rates 
fall as a way of keeping the economy out of a recession 
the fed has been struggling to engineer a softlanding where 
growth slows enough to dampen inflationary pressures but without a 
recession 
wyss said he believed the odds were still 21 that the central 
bank would be successful in avoiding a recession this year 
the fed seems to be on track for a softlanding wyss said 
he said fridays unemployment report was particularly encouraging 
because it showed that average hourly earnings a good barometer of 
wage pressures showed only a moderate increase last month

six of the 10 richest people in the world are 
japanese but the united states still leads the world in the total 
number of billionaires according to estimates compiled by forbes 
magazine 
for the third year running yoshiaki tsutsumi led forbes list of 
private billionaires even though his wealth wasnt quite as much as 
it had been 12 months earlier 
tsutsumi head of japans seibu railway group has a personal net 
worth of at least 15 billion over 3 billion less than estimated 
last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major 
currencies forbes said sunday 
the estimate was far greater than that made by fortune magazine 
in its september 1988 ranking of those it considered the worlds 
richest people which valued tsutsumis holdings at a mere 28 
billion 
in last years list forbes estimated tsutsumis net worth was 
189 billion 
the magazine reports in its july 24 issue that tsutsumi edged out 
secondranked taikichiro mori by less than 1 billion 
mori a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings 
in tokyo has an estimated net worth of 142 billion in last 
years survey forbes placed moris worth at about 18 billion 
the thirdrichest on the list was american sam moore walton 
founder of the third largest retailer in the united states walmart 
stores inc walton and his family are worth an estimated 87 
billion up from forbes 1988 estimate of 65 billion 
after the waltons came canadas reichmann brothers owners of the 
olympia amp york real estate empire with a combined net worth of 
about 8 billion 
the rest of the 10 richest people in the world their country and 
industries according to forbes were shin kyukho south korea 
candy real estate hirotomo takei and family japan publishing 
real estate kitaro watanabe japan real estate hotels haruhiko 
yoshimoto and family japan real estate hans and gad rausing 
sweden liquids packaging and eitaro itoyama japan land 
forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the 
world with personal assets worth over 1 billion 
the united states was the country with the most billionaires 
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title japan ranked second 
with 41 and west germany was third with 20 
american also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988 
survey with 47 individuals followed by japans 32 and west 
germanys 16 
among the richest of the worlds rich were people who didnt 
necessarily come by their money in an honest way 
colombias cocaine barons for instance are still putting away 
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit 
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years 
three of them made forbes world billionaires list including 
pablo escobar gaviria leader of the notorious medellin cocaine 
cartel with an estimated personal net worth of 3 billion the 
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the ochoa family worth more 
than 2 billion and gonzalo rodriguez gacha with more than 1 
billion 
in compiling its list forbes does not consider royal families 
and heads of state in compiling its list of wealthy people and 
individuals because their wealth derives more from political 
heritage than from economic effort theirs are feudal fortunes not 
capitalistic ones 
the magazine also excludes dictators such as cubas fidel castro 
or north koreas kim il sung

a federal judge friday temporarily barred 
wilkinson sword inc from airing television commercials for its new 
ultra glide razor 
the preliminary injunction was sought by the gillette co which 
sued wilkinson for false advertising in may 
us district judge kimba wood in manhattan said gillette was 
likely to succeed on the merits of its allegations that the 
commercials misled the public by implying ultra glides shavers were 
six times smoother than gillettes product atra plus 
in the ads atlantabased wilkinson says ultra glides special 
lubricating strip provided a smoother shave than a similar strip on 
atra plus 
woods ruling reversed a written opinion she made thursday 
rejecting gillettes request for the preliminary injunction that 
would bar wilkinson from showing the television commercials 
she said she reconsidered after reviewing a market study that 
found no substantial differences in the smoothness of the two 
shaving systems 
a wilkinson attorney steven e levitsky asked for a stay of the 
order because he said its effect would be devastating to the 
company the commercials are the only television advertising 
wilkinson is currently showing he said 
wilkinson is a small player in the 750 million wetshave razor 
market with about a 4 percent share compared with more than 60 
percent for gillette 
wood declined to stop the injunction which will be in effect 
until the case is resolved a trial date could be set for later this 
summer

the dollar finished lower against all major 
currencies except the japanese yen friday after a steady selloff 
sparked by fears that interest rates would decline 
gold prices also lost ground on the new york commodity exchange 
gold bullion for current delivery slipped to 38360 a troy ounce 
from 38640 on thursday republic national bank of new york quoted 
a late bid for gold of 38200 an ounce as of 4 pm edt down from 
thursdays late bid of 38425 
domestic currency trading began with a jolt as the labor 
department issued a report showing the nations unemployment rate 
climbed 01 percent to 53 percent last month 
traders initially were confused by the specifics of the report 
which showed lowerthanexpected nonfarm payroll growth coupled 
with a sharply higher revision for maynonfarm businesses added 
just 180000 jobs last month but mays payroll expansion was 
revised upward to 207000 jobs 
the first reaction was the dollar went up said kevin lawrie 
vice president and manager at bank of bostons new york office 
but that only lasted five minutes before the dollar came 
barreling off he said the report ultimately depressed the dollar 
by serving as yet another example of the economys slowdown 
traders said the dollar remained under pressure from the 
fundamental threat it has faced throughout the week the prospect of 
lower interest rates dollardenominated securities like bonds are 
more expensive when interest rates edge lower which depresses the 
need for dollars to purchase them 
rumors circulated through the market that the federal reserve may 
be preparing to reduce its discount rate before the weekend 
we got a lot of dollar selling this afternoon said stephen 
flanagan a vice president at manufacturers hanover trust co 
flanagan did not attribute the selloff solely to the unemployment 
report however he stressed instead that the report set the stage 
for upcoming statistics due out next week by suggesting that 
further weakness in the economy is likely 
the government is scheduled to report on industrial production 
factory use and retail sales next week each bearish report gives 
the federal reserve a greater incentive to trim interest rates

point or 650 for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
moves in the opposite direction from price declined to 803 from 
809 percent late thursday 
the labor department reported that the nations unemployment rate 
edged up to 53 percent in june from 52 percent in may as 
businesses created a modest 180000 new jobs there were signs in 
the report that economic growth is cooling and an indication as well 
of an easing of the wage inflation that has troubled some analysts 
nancy vanden houten moneymarket economist for merrill lynch 
capital markets in new york said the increases in nonfarm payroll 
and hourly earnings were below market expectations 
the consensus was about 225000 and there was only a onecent 
increase in hourly earnings she said the market for a long 
time has been focusing on signs of inflation that definitely was 
positive news in terms of inflation 
average hourly earnings of production and supervisory workers 
were essentially unchanged after rising an average 03 percent in 
the first five months of the year the government said 
the report was one of many in recent weeks that suggested the 
economy is easing off its brisk pace of the last several years and 
underscored a widelyheld belief that the federal reserve might now 
allow shortterm interest rates to decline 
jay goldinger a principal at the investment firm capital insight 
in beverly hills calif said despite the gains market activity was 
volatile in thin dealings as traders anticipated the feds next move 
some investors didnt know what to do with the employment 
numbers goldinger said the market was confused over whether 
the fed would ease that caused the bond market to be more volatile 
than usual 
the fed has kept a tight grip on credit by encouraging higher 
interest rates in recent months in hopes of curbing growth and 
taming inflation inflation erodes the value of fixedincome 
securities such as bonds and notes higher interest rates also 
depress bond prices

a federal appeals court friday rebuffed an 
attempt by the federal communications commission to revoke state 
oversight of onpremise telephone wiring and maintenance 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
ruling on a complaint by the national association of regulatory 
utility commissioners said the fcc could step into matters of state 
telephone regulation only when state rules interfere with the fccs 
regulation of interstate phone service 
the court found that the fcc in 1987 exceeded its authority when 
it preempted state regulation of the inside wiring business 
the onpremise wiring that connects residential and singleline 
business customers to the telephone network 
the court said the fcc may preempt state authority only to the 
degree necessary to keep such regulation from negating the 
commissions exercise of its lawful authority over interstate 
communication service 
the court ordered the fcc to reconsider the inside wiring matter 
the opinion was written by circuit judge james l buckley and 
was joined by judges spottswood w robinson iii and abner j mikva 
however the court agreed with the fcc that the commission may 
proscribe state regulations that would result in the subsidization 
of the installation and maintenance of inside wiring by the general 
ratepayers because it would allow the phone companies to undercut 
competition 
the court said the fcc may for example force states to separate 
the costs of installation and maintenance from basic telephone 
service rates 
the fcc had ordered that inside wiring installation and 
maintenance be deregulated and that phone companies be relieved of 
the requirement to install and maintain such wiring the fcc said 
individual customers should pay for their own installation and 
maintenance and that such costs should not be absorbed into basic 
telephone service charges 
the commission reasoned that deregulation would stimulate new 
competition and create a market for doityourself kits and 
thus lead to savings for customers 
under the 1934 communications act the fcc regulates interstate 
telephone service and states have authority over intrastate phone 
service but in its deregulation order the fcc said it must 
preempt state authority over inside wiring 
the commission argued that a federal program of competitive 
deregulated inside wiring could not coexist with a regulated state 
system unless consumers were required to purchase two sets of inside 
wiring one for interstate and the other for intrastate use 
the fcc also said inside wiring was not a common carrier 
telephone company service and therefore was not subject to state 
regulation 
naruc and a host of state utility commissions challenged the fcc 
order saying states should have the right to require phone 
companies to be inside wiring installers of last resort and that 
doityourself kits are not an acceptable substitute for a trained 
installer

boeing co engineers on thursday were trying to 
determine why an aging united airlines 727 developed a 20inch crack 
in a part of its fuselage 
the split was in the same general area as the rupture in an aloha 
airlines 737 that lost part of its roof over hawaii last year 
however both boeing and the federal aviation administration said 
the cracking appeared entirely different from that in the aloha 
plane 
this is a unique situation said faa spokesman david duff in 
seattle this is the first time a report of cracking has been made 
in this area 
duff added the cracking was not typical of the type often found 
in older aircraft in which tiny cracks tend to form along lines of 
rivet holes where sections of the planes skin overlap 
the faa ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47 
oldest 727s after the crack was discovered by united inspectors 
during a routine maintenance check june 26 at denvers stapleton 
international airport 
united immediately notified the faa and the 25yearold plane was 
repaired and placed back in service said united spokesman rob 
doughty at the airlines headquarters in chicago 
the plane delivered in february 1964 to united was the 23rd 727 
built said boeing commercial airplanes spokesman tom cole it had 
46587 landings a number he characterized as not overly high 
airlines have reported three more planes with similar cracks 
since the inspections began bringing the total to four faa 
spokesman dave duff told kiro television in seattle 
doughty said the new cracks were minor compared with the 
20inch crack that led to the faa order but were in the same general 
area they are similar but much smaller cracks he said 
operators of the 727s have until july 15 to complete the 
inspections duff said it was not known how many planes have been 
checked so far 
preliminary indications are that the cracking in the united 727 
was caused by metal fatigue according to an airworthiness directive 
the faa telegraphed to 727 operators last week 
without corrective measures cracks in the fuselage skin could 
result in rapid decompression of the plane in flight the faa said 
the cracked segment was brought to boeing laboratories in 
seattle where engineers were trying to understand why it occurred 
cole said analysis probably will take several days he said 
the threeengine 727 which boeing built from 1962 to 1984 was 
the bestselling commercial jet before being surpassed by the boeing 
737 cole said 1765 727s are still in service including 41 of the 
47 planes covered by the faa order 
operators of the 41 planes were to make the inspections and 
report back to the faa within 15 days duff said 
the april 28 1988 aloha accident in which a flight attendant 
fell to her death before the crew could land the badly damaged 
plane focused worldwide attention on aging aircraft the 
19yearold 737 flown by aloha was one of the most heavily used 737s 
in existence with nearly 90000 landings 
the national transportation safety board said the probable cause 
of the accident was the failure of alohas maintenance workers to 
detect significant disbonding and fatigue damage along the skin of 
the twinengine jet

volatile market than gold during the last two years and that ample 
supplies of silver make its price more prone to retreats than 
rallies

the federal aviation administration may order 
inspections of more older boeing 727 jetliners as a precaution after 
cracks were found in the fuselages of three 727s flown by united 
airlines an faa spokesman said friday 
spokesman david duff said faa officials were considering 
requiring inspections on approximately 400 of the threeengine jets 
built by the boeing co in the late 1960s no cracks have been 
reported among those jets and any inspection would be purely a 
precautionary and prudent measure by the faa duff said 
if not corrected the faa said the cracks could lead to sudden 
decompression of the aircraft cabin 
the faa ordered inspections and any necessary repairs of the 47 
oldest 727s after united found a 20inch crack in a 25yearold jet 
during a june 26 maintenance check united spokesman rob doughty 
said tiny cracks were found on the two other 727s after the faa 
issued its airworthiness directive june 30 
all three planes have been repaired doughty said united has 16 
jets that required inspection and the checks were being completed 
friday night he said 
boeing said 41 of the 47 planes are still in service among other 
carriers flying them are continental airlines with two planes twa 
with three american airlines with seven and trump shuttle with 
one spokesmen for those companies said most of the planes had been 
inspected with no cracks found 
the faa deadline for completing the inspections is july 15 duff 
said he had not received an official report of how many planes had 
been checked 
the 20inch crack was in the same general area as the break in an 
aloha airlines 737 that lost part of its top over hawaii last year

different 
this is the first time a report of cracking has been made in 
this area duff said adding that the cracking was not typical of 
the type often found in older aircraft 
duff said thursday faa officials suspect hoop tension 
fatigue caused by outward forces in pressurized flight against the 
different thicknesses of aircraft skin where skin sections overlap 
the cracked segment was brought earlier this week to boeing 
laboratories in seattle where engineers are trying to find out why 
it occurred boeing commercial airplanes spokesman jack gamble said 
friday it probably would take about a week for the analysis to be 
completed

britains largest union on friday called a dock 
strike starting tuesday to compel employers to continue national 
negotiations on pay and conditions 
after its dockworker members voted nearly 3to1 to strike the 
14 millionmember transport and general workers union ordered out 
its 9400 registered dockworkers and said the stoppage could last 
for months 
the strike vote was 6067 in favor and 2111 against for an 
indefinite strike to protest the employers refusal to allow 
national talks after the end of the national dock labor scheme this 
week 
dockers must understand that if they walk out not all of them 
will be coming back thats not a threat its economic reality 
said nicholas finney chairman of the national association of port 
employers 
if any registered dock worker is sacked during the course of 
the dispute there can be no return to work until he is 
reinstated countered ron todd the unions general secretary 
the employers backed by the government want a shift to local 
bargaining with the abolition july 3 of the dock labor plan at 60 
ports that handle 70 percent of britains trade by volume and 50 
percent by value 
there are 102 ports handling the remainder some employing fewer 
than 25 people 
the dock labor plan guarantees registered dockworkers a paid job 
regardless of whether they have cargoes to handle it was introduced 
during world war ii to maintain a steady work force and was made 
permanent in 1947 
the employers say the plan protected restrictive practices 
forced the employment of 12 percent more workers than needed and was 
outdated by modern cargo handling mainly gantryswung containers 
replacing the dockers hook 
modern methods have cut the registered dock workforce from 65000 
in 1967 to 9400 about 1000 more workers are employed in the 102 
nonplan ports which handle the remainder of the countrys trade 
large ports affected by the strike will include london tees and 
hartlepool immingham and grimsby forth southampton and liverpool 
most english channel ferries should escape the strike because the 
ports of dover and felixstowe are outside the plan 
the major impact of the strike is expected on movement of cars 
containerized manufactured goods newsprint timber grain 
perishable fruit animal feed iron ore and other minerals and 
chemicals 
north sea oil operators plan to switch their supply vessels from 
aberdeen and dundee in scotland to norwegian ports 
finney said more than 1000 dockworkers had quit before the 
strike accepting up to 35000 pounds or about 56700 in 
severance pay 
extensive plans have already been made by shippers and port 
customers to minimize the effect of a strike and safeguard the 
nations trade finney said 
the end of the dock labor plan means that dockworkers can be 
fired and nonunion labor can be used on waterfronts both actions 
formerly were illegal the employers have been encouraging 
dockworkers to sign individual contracts

the united mine workers on friday called 
a threeday holiday for its members east of the mississippi river 
saying the contractually allowed memorial period would restore calm 
in the coal fields 
as many as 46000 miners in 10 states have been involved in 
unauthorized strikes against coal operators who signed a nostrike 
contract with the union they walked out over the pittston cos 
refusal to sign a umw contract 
umw president richard trumka called the memorial period 
although the union has requested that they return to work the 
conditions which led to the protest excessive fines by federal and 
state courts the arrest of thousands of union members and 
supporters by the virginia state police the threat of indefinite 
jailings of union leaders and supporters and pittstons refusal to 
negotiate in good faith remain unchanged trumka said 
it is the first official sanction of the wildcat strikes that 
have stricken the coal fields since june 12 the union had been 
under orders to lead the miners back to work 
the union is calling this memorial period in an attempt to calm 
the volatile situation in the coal fields in the hope that this 
period will help put an end to a situation where the actions of one 
renegade coal company and its allies have disrupted the entire coal 
industry trumka said 
morris feibusch of the bituminous coal operators association 
which negotiated the national contract with the union said he had 
no comment 
the last two weeks of the wildcat walkouts have coincided with a 
national vacation period for most miners covered by the umw 
contract prompting speculation that its end would also mark the end 
of the unauthorized picketing 
right now i see absolutely no movement to go back to work 
said howard green a umw international executive board member from 
charlestonbased district 17 
it wasnt clear what trumka plans at the end of the memorial 
holiday which will begin monday but umw spokesman john duray said 
union leaders would try to change the members minds by the end of 
the break 
these people were out to protest something and they want to see 
a change in the situation duray said we will be out in the 
next three days to make sure they see a change in the situation 
union members will not have to picket other mines during the 
meorial period duray said keeping them off the streets should help 
restore order he said 
the purpose is to provide less of a sense of chaos out there 
he said we wont have pickets going around some locals will have 
meetings during the three days positive results will have a greater 
chance 
chaos reigned at a beckley meeting hall friday as about 2000 
striking coal miners protested the firing of 28 colleagues and 
prevented a hearing between union officials and the company that 
dismissed the miners 
toneys branch coal co inc fired the men on thursday making 
them the first dismissed since the wildcat strikes began dismissal 
forms circulated among the picketers said the men were fired for 
refusing to cross picket lines at the racine mine 
company officals and represenatives from umw district 17 refused 
to cross the pickets and enter the raleigh county armory where the 
sides were scheduled to meet to discuss the firings the pickets 
dispersed after the meeting was postponed 
this should tell them that all its going to do is incite the 
workers green said from a telephone booth near the armory 
both sides agreed to waive time restrictions on the hearing and 
said they would meet at a later date the firings apparently stand 
however 
about 37000 workers in eight states were idled friday as umw 
members showed support for 1900 coal miners striking the pittston 
co which wants a separate contract with the union 
pittston workers mined coal for more than 14 months without a 
contract before walking out april 5 refusing a company request that 
miners work mandatory overtime and on sundays and refusing proposed 
cuts in medical benefits for pensioners 
the bcoa said friday that the wildcat strikes have kept 6 
million from entering the trust fund set up to pay medical benefits 
to 118000 pensioners who retired before 1976 bcoa president joseph 
brennan also blamed 14 million in other losses since february 1988 
on the unions granting some companies lower contribution rates and 
some coal companies withholding contributions 
what we need is for the umwa miners to return to work for 
the companies and the umwa to honor existing contractural 
commitments and for the umwa and the industry to work cooperatively 
to find additional sources of revenue for the funds brennan said 
pittston has not paid into the fund since january 1988 feibusch 
said despite a continuing obligation to it because it has former 
employees covered by it
