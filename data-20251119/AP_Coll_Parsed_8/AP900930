temple universitys striking professors 
rejected a second contract offer sunday night as the threat of 
canceling hundreds of classes for the entire semester loomed 
common pleas judge samuel lehrer planned to reopen a hearing 
monday into the universitys request that he force the professors 
back to work 
the proposal which union members said offered little new was 
rejected by a vote of 372 to 62 
if pickets are still marching tuesday 40 percent or 1900 of 
temples 4700 classes will be canceled for lack of a professor 
university officials say there is no alternative because there 
wont be enough days to make up lost class time before the spring 
semester starts 
patricia bradley a journalism professor said 445 union members 
and 107 nonduespaying members attended sunday nights meeting 
only duespaying members were allowed to vote she said the union 
leadership recommended rejection of the offer 
the proposal offered 5 percent salary increases over four years 
instead of previous two and threeyear offers and retained a 
request that the professors contribute 260 a year toward health 
insurance costs 
they think well just get tired and give up bradley said 
its a unionbusting strike i think thats generally 
accepted 
temples chief negotiator bob harrington said he was very 
disappointed by the vote he said the union broke agreements that 
the entire bargaining unit would vote on the proposal not just 
duespaying members and that the union leadership would not 
recommend how to vote 
the strike began sept 4 when the teachers rejected 5 percent 
increases over the next two years the teachers whose salary 
averages about 45500 want 7 percent pay increases and do not 
want to pay more for health care 
temple an independent university that receives substantial 
state support went to court after the first rejection seeking a 
court order to force teachers be ordered to return to class 
the number of faculty members on strike is unclear university 
officials and the temple association of university professionals 
which represents 1100 faculty members refuse to offer any 
estimates 
judge lehrer held two days of hearings and got both sides to 
agree to the vote on the new offer both sides would return to 
court monday if the offer was rejected he said 
meanwhile some of the schools 30000 students have blocked 
city streets daily and stood outside a courtroom chanting their 
protest of anything less than a fully operational university some 
were arrested for invading liacouras office 
time has already run out for some students missing one or more 
classes they need for a degree 
the whole thing stinks said james cunningham 20 a 
sophomore in radio television and film who was one of more than 
100 students who have withdrawn from school the deadline for 
withdrawal from school with a full refund is oct 8 
some 23000 students are missing at least one class in the fall 
semester and 6000 have had no classes at all because of the 
walkout 
they are yanking the carpet from under my feet said doug 
miller 27 a senior architecture student if classes dont resume 
he will not be taking enough credits to be classified as a 
fulltime studnet and could lose at least part of his financial 
aid 
temple lawyer john langel said that if the offer is rejected 
all classes that arent meeting by tuesday will be canceled 
this is not going to be an educational institution said 
striking history professor michael harris its going to be a 
phony basically this institution is folding

countdown to unification on wednesday

the tiny village of steinstuecken just 
beyond the southwestern city limits of west berlin is only a small 
footnote to the cold war era but it looms large as a monument to 
germanamerican friendship 
that friendship was celebrated this weekend as village 
residents turned out to say thanks and farewell to the american 
soldiers who were their lifeline to the west 
after world war ii the community of 200 people became part of 
west berlin and fell under the american sector but when the 
berlin wall went up the village was cut off from the metropolis by 
a narrow strip of east german territory 
only one road link was open strict controls hampered residents 
on trips to berlin villagers feared there would be a total 
blockade 
that didnt happen thanks to the americans 
us military officials posted military police in the village 
american helicopters made supply flights providing the enclave 
with a vital link to the outside world 
with the unification of east and west germany a few days away 
the villgers gathered saturday to remember those difficult days 
the americans were our greatest security said gert knecht 
a villager in his 60s he recalled the many friendships that 
developed one american military policeman married a local girl he 
said 
knecht likened steinstueckens plight to being able to walk 
around freely inside your home but you couldnt go out in 
freedom 
our security came every week by helicopter he said 
now the helicopter flights are commemorated by a monument in the 
village with a design featuring chopper blades 
the farewell gathering held in a sunny poplar grove didnt 
feature any brass bands or elaborate ceremonies the people of 
steinstuecken brought homebaked cakes and pies 
children clustered around maj gen raymond e haddock 
commandant of us forces in west berlin as he handed out badges 
that said deutschamerikanische freundschaft germanamerican 
friendship 
the regular helicopter flights ended in 1972 after eastwest 
relations improved but the us army aviation unit that flew the 
route kept up ties with steinstuecken 
a final flight was part of saturdays ceremony villagers 
joined by neighbors from the east waved goodbye to the departing 
aircraft 
we must protect this germanamerican friendship and widen it 
in the future said the village mayor juergen klemann 
it is a theme that has been often expressed in the final days 
before the unification of east and west germany at midnight 
tuesday 
commentators warn that the present peaceful course of events and 
germanys allegiance to the western nato alliance could change if 
the united states turned to isolationism and the germans turned to 
antiamericanism 
the burghers of steinstuecken believe they owe their western 
standard of living and their freedoms to the years of american 
protection 
but not all west germans share their view of the us military 
presence 
in the early 1980s hundreds of thousands of west germans 
demonstrated against us military policy in europe especially the 
stationing of mediumrange nuclear missiles in germany and other 
natomember nations 
while the united states and west germany enjoyed good relations 
during the administration of chancellor helmut schmidt who left 
office in 1982 schmidts social democratic party showed increasing 
irritation with us policies it had long advocated a less 
militaristic posture of nato 
west germans have become increasingly interested in cutting back 
us troops in their country there have even been calls for the 
shutdown of the sprawling rheinmain us air force base outside 
frankfurt in central west germany to make room for the growing 
financial metropolis 
some of these pressures have been removed the mediumrange 
nuclear missiles and the chemical weapons are gone and us and 
other allied troops in germany are to be reduced in response to 
improved relations with the soviet union 
will future generations of germans remember the missile disputes 
and the earsplitting lowlevel training flights of the us air 
force or will they remember the 194849 berlin airlift and the 
special attention paid to steinstuecken 
gen haddock whose powers as a military governor of west berlin 
end at midnight tuesday said in his farewell speech that we have 
an obligation to keep alive the memory of the airlift and the 
chapter of history written in steinstuecken 
for they indicate the points at which the history of germany 
and the united states of america was a common one he said

elections for the nations 435 house seats are 
likely to yield only slight shifts in power but analysts caution 
that this years voting could be among the most volatile and 
unpredictable in years 
novembers balloting will follow one of the strangest 18 
months in recent political history analyst charles cook says of 
a period that has seen upheavals in eastern europe the persian 
gulf domestic issues and the american economy 
few are willing to bet on where it all will lead but most 
analysts and operatives are guessing that democrats will pad their 
258to176 majority by less than 10 seats 
in normal times that would be a facesaving outcome for 
republicans as the party in control of the white house the gop 
historically could expect to lose 15 or more house seats in an 
offyear election 
several factors would seem to favor the gop this time around 
president bush enjoys nearrecord popularity ratings his standing 
increased by his handling of the middle east crisis and polls show 
a general public disgust with congress which is controlled by the 
democrats 
but on the other side of the ledger the economy among the 
most powerful determinants of political fortune is headed 
downward and republicans are being forced to defend more socalled 
open seats where there is no incumbent seeking reelection 
because 11 otherwise safe gop house members are running for the 
senate or state offices 
the effect of the volatility has been to put most races into 
slow motion congress which had planned to adjourn by oct 5 so 
members could go home and campaign now is unlikely to get out of 
washington until oct 20 or so 
issues that have taken on local importance from abortion to 
taxes and the savings and loan crisis have had to compete for air 
time and headlines with developments in iraq and kuwait political 
experts say the effect will be to compress the intense part of the 
election season into the final two weeks 
for one in five house districts that will make no difference 
seventysix incumbent lawmakers 42 democrats and 34 republicans 
will coast to reelection without major party opposition 
and as has become common in house contests few of their 
colleagues have much to worry about political analysts single out 
fewer than two dozen races where the incumbent is endangered 
topping that list are reps frank annunzio dill charles 
pashayan rcalif and denny smith rore all of whom are linked 
to the 500 billion scandal over the failure of the savings and 
loan industry 
a handful of others are in trouble because of political or 
ethical problems 
rep arlan stangeland rminn got in hot water for charging 
taxpayers for hundreds of longdistance calls to a female former 
employee of a lobbying firm 
it was revealed that rep roy dyson dmd who accepts large 
contributions from the defense industry in his capacity as an armed 
services committee member claimed conscientious objector status 
during the vietnam war 
rep stan parris rva said during a debate with his 
democratic opponent that he opposes affirmative action because it 
is worse to discriminate against majorities than against racial 
minorities 
and always vulnerable are freshmen many of whom won narrowly in 
1988 and have yet to establish themselves firmly in their new 
seats ben jones dga george sangmeister dill bill 
sarpalius dtexas greg laughlin dtexas peter hoagland dneb 
jolene unsoeld dwash craig james rfla ron machtley rri 
and peter smith rvt 
most of the action and the attention of democratic and 
republican party operatives focuses on the 2 open seats where 
there is no incumbent eleven are seats previously held by 
democrats and 18 were formerly gop seats 
one hotspot is maines first district where democrat joseph 
brennan is running to get back his old job as governor fighting 
for brennans house seat are democratic state sen tom andrews and 
republican david emery who is making a comeback bid 
also tough for democrats to defend is the cincinnati district of 
thomas luken who is retiring lukens son mayor charles luken is 
vying against ken blackwell a former cincinnati mayor and official 
of the department of housing and urban development blackwell is 
the gops best hope of electing a black republican to a house seat 
in five decades 
a slugfest has developed in the texas where democratic rep 
marvin leath is retiring state sen chet edwards a democrat is 
running to replace him against republican hugh shine a state house 
member shine has been attacking edwards for appearing at a 
fundraiser for a gay and lesbian group in houston last year 
democrats see their best hopes at picking open seats in 
arkansas where democratturnedrepublican tommy robinson left his 
seat to run for governor and in rhode island hawaii iowa and 
idaho where republican house members are running for senate seats

when harvey gantt exhorts people to get 
religion and show some signs he doesnt mean they should start 
speaking in tongues hes talking about a us senate race that 
only people power can win 
people power brought down communism in eastern europe and 
gantts task seems hardly less formidable hes trying to dislodge 
republican jesse helms north carolinas controversial and 
wellfinanced threeterm senator 
be missionaries for me gantt tells black county employees 
white mountainfolk and wineandcheese liberals across the state 
be truth squads for me get out the vote for me he says and we 
can demonstrate that people power is stronger than all the money in 
the world 
helms an outspoken conservative with a national fundraising 
network has been pulling in campaign contributions at a 
recordbreaking pace and while his views and style alienate many 
voters he has a devoted following and a hardhitting campaign 
style that has crushed all of his previous opponents including a 
sitting governor 
but challenges are a way of life for gantt a softspoken 
architect he was the first black student at clemson university 
the first black mayor of charlotte the national democratic partys 
first black senate nominee in this century a victory in november 
would make him the first black southern senator since 
reconstruction 
polls show a deadeven race with few voters undecided but gantt 
radiated calm and confidence on a recent campaign journey that took 
him from depressed rural pockets in north carolinas northeast 
corner to wealthy coastal villages on the outer banks 
we really are going to bring jesse helms home he told a 
racially balanced crowd at a pigpicking barbecue on the 
sweeping lawn of a riverfront home 
neither helms multimilliondollar campaign warchest nor his 
aura of invincibility fazes gantt ive never seen him as being a 
great power ive always seen him as a beneficiary of good luck 
he says 
gantt 47 carries a traditional democratic message of populism 
and government compassion enlivened with tales of his humble 
origins and gentle digs at helms 
though some fans wear ganttforsenate buttons that say making 
history gantt does not present himself as a pioneering 
standardbearer for blacks hed rather be viewed as the unifying 
forwardlooking alternative to a man he says has few allies and 
pushes divisive priorities that are irrelevant to most north 
carolinians 
its all right to get somebody wholl stand up for what he or 
she believes in gantt tells supporters repeating the rationale 
many voters give for choosing helms but you also ought to get 
somebody wholl stand up for you 
helms prickly personality is at least part of the reason north 
carolina gets a poor return on the tax dollars it sends to 
washington gantt told a group of courthouse employees 
ive got to think it has to do with the fact that hes kind of 
ornery he doesnt get along with anybody gantt said mildly as 
the air filled with knowing chuckles 
gantt also accuses helms of thumbing his nose at the states 
voters by refusing to debate publicize his schedule or answer 
questions 
if the two candidates stood side by side and talked about their 
visions gantt told an affluent nags head gathering i could win 
every time im convinced of that he added to laughter i 
think hes kind of convinced of that too 
gantt makes no bones about his vision a government that helps 
ensure jobs health care education and a clean environment for its 
citizens 
if liberal means caring about people then im a liberal he 
told those gathered on the banks of the pasquotank river for the 
pigpicking i just want us to return to our party and its 
heritage and its great leaders 
it was an apt message for that area which went for helms in 
1984 despite an overwhelming democratic edge in voter registration 
gantts unabashed liberalism ultimately may not prove any more 
popular among moderates than helms extreme often combative 
conservativism 
but he has been attracting overflow crowds and devoted converts 
from the mountains to the shore gwen cruickshanks the currituck 
county democratic chairwoman said outofstaters at a national 
businesswomens conference in charlotte bombarded her with 
unsolicited checks after gantt spoke thats the galvanizing 
effect this man has she said 
gantt also is galvanizing blacks gantt it really sounds 
good to me harvey harvey hundreds of black students chanted at 
a rally at elizabeth city state college 
gantt who designed three buildings at the college was mobbed 
embraced begged for autographs im going to be there for you 
promised the wouldbe senator my door is going to be open for 
you 
but blacks account for only 20 percent of north carolinas 
votingage population and while he won two mayoral terms in 
75percentwhite charlotte gantts race could handicap him in a 
contest where every last vote will count 
i meet lots of people who say ive never voted for a black 
man and im not going to now said gail singh a white gantt 
supporter who runs a video business on the outer banks you cant 
say theres no race factor in northeastern north carolina 
gantt does not concede a race factor just as he will not 
concede that helms financial advantage translates into a 
competitive edge helms had raised 6 million as of june 30 
compared to gantts 853000 
the democrat said his campaign is on track toward a goal of 
raising 5 million to 7 million he called that more than 
sufficient to maintain a reasonable amount of television we dont 
run as many commercials as jesse helms we just buy smarter 
helms is making few appearances and relying almost entirely on 
tv ads including scathing attacks on gantts support for abortion 
rights and reductions in defense spending gantt says he watches 
them and is amused 
i end up laughing he said then i realize ive got to be 
serious some people believe this gantt is running spots that 
attack helms education record his antiabortion position and what 
he considers the senators misplaced priorities such as his 
crusade against federal funding for obscene art 
but gantt also has warm and fuzzy ads in which he talks about 
his background and beliefs supplementing his personal efforts to 
introduce himself to voters around the state 
he tells his life story often and nowhere was the tale more 
poignant than at the perquimans county courthouse built in the 
slave days of 1825 
gantt a descendant of slaves stood at the front of a small 
colonialstyle courtroom that looks like a setting for the 
continental congress i come from a workingclass family my 
father had an eighthgrade education he began 
he traced his fathers life two and three jobs at a time the 
government loan that allowed him to move the family from public 
housing to their own home the government restoring his dignity 
with civil rights laws the government helping him put five 
children through college 
of his own fortunes and the threshold on which he now stands 
gantt said nothing then but later at a nags head fern bar crowded 
with the wellheeled he wore an exuberant grin as he declared 
only in america

michael owen perrys medicine could restore his 
sanity but it has one enormous side effect it could speed his 
death 
perry is a prisoner on death row and his fate will be argued 
tuesday before the us supreme court the state of louisiana wants 
to force him to take psychiatric medication if he is legally sane 
he can be executed 
perrys lawyers argue that forcible medicating would be a cruel 
and unusual punishment that ignores perrys rights to avoid 
unwanted medication 
the american medical association and the american psychiatric 
association say treating perry to aid in his execution would turn 
the healing art on its head perrys sentence should be commuted to 
life in prison they suggest 
were saying the cost here which is really a fundamental 
realignment of the role of medicine is a very high cost and the 
states interest in the difference between capital punishment and 
life imprisonment without parole doesnt justify that cost said 
attorney joel klein 
the state says giving him the drug is simply a necessary step 
for carrying out a death sentence a justifiable limitation on a 
condemned mans liberties much like strapping him into the electric 
chair besides the state is required to provide medical care and 
the medicine is good for him louisiana says 
perry 35 suffers from schizoaffective disorder causing him 
delusions hallucinations and disordered thinking 
he was sentenced in 1985 for shooting his parents and three 
other family members to death louisianas supreme court affirmed 
the conviction and the sentence but suggested a review of perrys 
mental competence to be executed 
there is a tradition in angloamerican law that people should 
not be executed while insane this doctrine which dates back to 
medieval times was adopted by the us supreme court in a 1986 
decision 
insanity is a legal term not a medical one in this case it 
refers to mental illness so severe that the prisoner is not aware 
of the impending punishment and why he is to suffer it 
the louisiana court ruled perry was sane but only while on 
medication it also ordered that perry be medicated even over his 
objection 
after the state supreme court refused to hear a challenge to 
that decision perrys lawyers appealed to the federal high court 
lawyers for both sides declined to be interviewed on the record 
but their supreme court briefs lay out their arguments in detail 
lawyers for louisiana say the death sentence wiped out any legal 
power perry would have to refuse the medication 
forced medication would not be a cruel and unusual 
punishment because perry would benefit medically from it the state 
says common sense dictates that the state does not violate the 
eighth amendment by doing something good for a prisoner 
in fact louisiana is required to medicate perry because the 
supreme court has declared that deliberately ignoring a prisoners 
serious medical need itself constitues cruel and unusual 
punishment the brief says 
perrys attorneys say the forced medication would be 
unconstitutional punishment rather than treatment the court order 
gives no consideration to perrys medical needs nor physician 
judgment they say 
the order also ignores the very real prospect of serious 
side effects raising the prospect of taking a drooling 
incontinent and tremulus man to the execution chamber they 
wrote 
in any case perrys lawyers say perrys response to medication 
is sporadic and unpredictable making it impossible to say whether 
he would be competent on the day of his execution 
with this instability and unpredictability how is michaels 
execution to be carried out the lawyers asked can the state 
wait until a good day and execute michael can michael be 
executed if his good days outnumber his bad days by some 
amount what amount and what happens if the date set in the death 
warrant is a bad day 
the ama and psychiatric association meanwhile say the death 
sentence does not outweigh perrys interest in avoiding unwanted 
medication an interest especially great when the injection sets 
the prisoner directly on the road to execution 
involuntary medication was not part of perrys sentence nor is 
it generally authorized by confinement the associations argue 
prior court decision support the idea that involuntary medical 
treatment is not permitted if it runs against a persons medical 
interests and is not necessary to treat a condition that may harm 
other people they say 
as for the argument that the medication would help perry any 
benefit would be both fleeting and purchased at the cost of his 
life the associations said in a brief 
outside observers are split on their reaction to the case 
dr gary glass an associate psychiatry professor at temple 
university and lecturer in law at villanova university said he 
personally hopes that the court would not allow execution of a 
person who is incompetent when not treated 
but his utilitarian practical answer is that nobody should 
be allowed to make a competent decision to avoid execution by 
becoming legally incompetent he said 
if a death sentence is imposed people ought not to be able to 
use their mental health and illness to manipulate that decision 
he said 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota calls it fundamentally wrong for any 
health care professional to give anybody psychiatric medication 
against their will for a nontherapeutic purpose 
if authorities are intent on executing a man while he is sane in 
such cases they should specify medication as part of the sentence 
and not pretend it is medical treatment he said

this capital now boils with political 
activity as algeria undertakes an arabstyle transition toward 
democracy 
one question dominates will free elections in this north 
african country replace a marxiststyle dictatorship with an 
islamic one 
the potent brew of politics and religion bubbles to life each 
evening in the casbah where bearded young men sip mint tea and 
dissect democracy and the koran in a capital long derided as 
moscow on the med 
vive fis long live the islamic salvation front reads 
the graffiti on the ketchaoua mosque a bastion of algerias most 
potent political movement 
this is a moslem country said ali hamidouche 32 its 
only natural that people would want a moslem government 
the 28 political parties and lively free press born since 
constitutional reforms in 1989 contrast sharply with an arab world 
ruled by monarchs dictators and oneparty states 
but vows by islaic councils elected last june to impose koranic 
law fuel fears that the democratic experiment may be short 
if the fis wins were dead a leading womens rights 
activist said 
the islamic salvation front took control of more than half the 
countrys municipal and regional councils june 12 in algerias 
first free elections since independence from france in 1962 
the verdict repudiated the ruling national liberation front 
fln and its 28year monopoly on power 
but local councils hold little power the fundamentalists cannot 
effect changes while the fln holds all seats in the national 
assembly 
their complaints forced president chadli bendjedid to move 
legislative elections ahead a year to next spring 
no matter who wins the first success of these elections will 
be stability and legitimacy for the national assembly fis leader 
abassi madani said in a recent newspaper interview 
the 59yearold philosophy professor presents the moderate face 
of a movement encompassing classical scholars and proiranian 
radicals 
his alter ego is ali belhadj 31 whose fiery speeches attract 
thousands he blames infidels france chief among them for 
algerias woes 
for the young men outside the ketchaoua mosque the fis heralds 
an end to the sovietinspired system the national liberation front 
imposed on algeria one of the continents largest countries and 
situated on the mediterranean 
the fundamentalists message is clear the old regime was 
corrupt it brought poverty and unemployment an islamic regime 
will stop corruption and thereby social problems 
the fis vows to end to secular practices that let men and women 
mingle at school and work 
for us secularism means liberty from god hamidouche said 
with a grimace 
ranged against the fundamentalists are dozens of political 
groupings but only a handful with significant support 
the fln remains the best organized thousands of its adherents 
run the public sector to which most algerians owe their livelihood 
but the fln managed only to win a quarter of the june vote 
theyll be lucky to keep 25 percent next time a western 
diplomat said people are fed up and theyve thrown up no young 
charismatic leader 
the oppostion includes the liberal rally for culture and 
democracy the centrist front for socialist forces and the populist 
movement for democracy in algeria 
the rally received a boost when the other two parties boycotted 
the june voting claiming the fln would rig the results their 
leaders are heroes of the war for independence berber chief 
hocine ait ahmed and algerias first president ahmed ben bella 
ben bella 73 is the man algerians are watching he hopes to 
weld a democratic consensus to lead the country out of its 
economic ills 
ben bellas stature is unrivaled by any living algerian he 
planned the 1954 uprising against france and ruled three years 
after independence until toppled in a military coup 
on thursday sept 27 he returned to algiers from exile in 
geneva telling his countrymen i dont come back to settle 
scores i come back to help my country build itself half of ben 
bellas life has been spent in exile or prison 
they never broke him said hocine guermouche spokesman for 
the movement for democracy in algeria 
youve seen mandela he spent 27 years in prison and never 
lost his spirit ben bella has done more he won the war 
but he also gave algeria ills it is only now shaking off secret 
police a singleparty system a marxist economy 
whoever wins next years elections will struggle to revive the 
sagging economy 
in october 1988 thousand of algerians rioted over living 
standards that plummeted along with prices for the countrys chief 
export oil 
scores of people including many fundamentalists died when the 
army crushed the uprising the deaths robbed the fln of popular 
legitimacy 
bendjedid whose term expires in 1993 distanced the government 
from the fln and drafted last years constitutional reforms he 
appointed technocrats to impose market economics 
no party seems likely to meddle with the privatization program 
but the pace of economic change remains slow 
unemployment officially stands at 25 percent families of 12 
often live in tworoom apartments the government estimates 800000 
new dwellings are needed 
long lines form at shops often empty of basic foodstuffs 
jobless young men survive by hawking blackmarket cigarettes 
strikes proliferate 
as the meuzzin at ketchaoua mosque called the faithful to 
prayer one young man said lots of political parties are fine as 
long as they adhere to islam 
if the people vote for the fis fine if they vote for 
some other party and they win thats good too said boumari 
nacer edde a casbah candy seller 
the important thing is that theres democracy we want 
democracy

not long after the 15000 residents elected a council dominated 
by the islamic salvation front fis posters went up announcing a 
ban against shorts 
the news quickly reaching europe was portrayed as evidence the 
fundamentalists knew no limits in imposing strict morality how 
could shorts be banned in a beach town 
the impression of firebreathing fundamentalists imposing a 
draconian crackdown killed the season 
june and july were just dead there were almost no 
europeans ahmed mansour remarked on the empty terrace of his 
restaurant 
but town administrator mohammed essamelli says the reality of 
the ban was more complicated 
first this laws been here since 1965 said essamelli 
all the new council did was say they intended to enforce it 
second the law does not affect tipasas beaches where men and 
women in western swimwear outnumber those in long robes 20 to one 
it covers only the town center and was modeled on similar rules 
on the french riviera 25 years ago essamelli said 
the law permits shorts in town if they reach the top of the knee 
for men or the bottom of the knee for women essamelli finds this 
reasonable 
mansour notes that no police officer has bothered to enforce the 
ordinance and says the fundamentalists dont want to bite the 
economic hand that feeds the electorate 
nobody has come here asking us to stop selling alcohol he 
said they may be for islam but they know this country needs 
other things too 
the tipasa case finds echoes elsewhere stories proliferate of 
official crackdowns on ice cream and alcohol most turn out to be 
exaggerated 
many of the reports originate with the official aps news agency 
an organ of the ruling national liberation front the 
fundamentalists thrashed the party in the elections 
the fundamentalists certainly hope to change algerian society 
councils have moved to segregate boys and girls at school the 
movement debates whether women should work 
but in the absence of holding national power legislative 
elections are planned next spring the changes are mostly limited 
to cosmetics 
in oran algerias second city humor made a difference 
fundamentalist councilors there denounced a festival of the 
popular rai music which celebrates youthful revolt they said one 
devoted to islamic music would be better 
a rai singer responded with a number featuring a compromise 
refrain i voted for the fis i voted for the fis

with state governments increasingly strapped for revenue many 
public universities are facing their worst money crunch in years 
this fall 
campuses in at least 15 states mostly on the east coast and 
midwest where state budgets are tightest are operating on 
barebones budgets that have led to program cuts fewer and more 
crowded classes and faculty cutbacks 
the average tuition increase at state colleges was 7 percent 
this fall according to a college board survey but in a few 
states tuition already is heading up in double digits and experts 
fear new more widespread increases as early as midterm if local 
economies worsen 
were in a situation thats deteriorating very rapidly said 
richard novak director of state education policy and finance of 
the american association of state colleges and universities 
whats happening in northeastern and midwestern states is 
spreading very rapidly down the coast they are facing sharp cuts 
that will have untold impact on those institutions 
an associated press survey found 
student fees are up 10 percent and numerous cuts are affecting 
california state universitys 20 campuses after state higher 
education appropriations rose just 26 percent to 169 billion 
at san francisco state 250 fall classes were canceled the san 
diego campus cut library hours and the number of people who shelve 
books thirty faculty positions will go unfilled at the san luis 
obispo campus 
the president of the university of massachusetts has warned he 
may have to fire teachers and cancel a week of classes following 
state higher education cuts of 27 million during the last two 
years including a 42 million cut announced by gov michael s 
dukakis the day classes opened 
tuition at new jerseys nine state colleges is up between 96 
percent and 194 percent 
rhode islands three major state schools have raised their 
rates about 9 percent after receiving 22 million less than they 
did last year because of state budget problems 
the florida board of regents has told the states nine 
universities to come up with 49 million in cuts to help make up a 
521 million state shortfall among the possibilities eliminating 
the first summer school term in 1991 
the city university of new york faced with 42 million in 
budget cuts is tightening enrollment procedures canceling 2000 
classes dropping 670 adjunct teachers and cutting library hours 
after three years of sharp funding increases maryland gov 
william donald schaefer has asked that higher education funds be 
cut 41 million during the current fiscal year because of a 150 
million shortfall in state revenue 
students staged a save unc rally this fall at the 
university of north carolina to protest cuts that have led to fewer 
classes and students sitting on the floor in others 
in several states including ohio massachusetts and oklahoma 
declining enrollment is further clouding the financial outlook at 
state campuses 
the picture isnt gloomy everywhere public campuses in iowa 
louisiana utah idaho texas new mexico and arizona are among 
those enjoying increased state appropriations and relatively modest 
tuition increases 
appropriations at the university of iowa are up 96 percent 
tuition is up just 3 percent 
with state funding in louisiana up more than 11 percent tuition 
at southern university didnt increase at all this fall 
state appropriations to higher education increased an average of 
7 percent during the last two years according to a study by the 
national association of state universities and landgrant colleges 
novak projects gains will be only half that in 199091 well 
below inflation and well below need 
he and other also foresee a spread of sharp tuition increases 
in nebraska campus officials are quaking over a proposed 
amendment limiting state spending the amendment on the nov 6 
ballot would hold annual budget increases to 2 percent 
we dont have a crisis right now but the big issue is the 2 
percent thing said rich bringelson executive officer of the 
nebraska state college system 
in north carolina a 336 million budget shortfall has meant 
appropriations to state campuses were cut by 5 percent the third 
straight year the schools have received less than they requested 
its reached the point where students prefer a tuition increase to 
further program cuts 
all of this is revolutionary talk but i think there is 
sentiment for supporting a tuition increase if it is reverted back 
to the universities said william hildebolt student body 
president at uncchapel hill

frank yatsu never thought hed live to see his 
government apologize for imprisoning him in world war ii but a 
check carrying that message should arrive in a few days just 
before he turns 107 
thats pretty good i think yatsu said the american 
government treated us in a christian way and its pretty good 
the government soon will start sending 20000 checks to each of 
the surviving japaneseamericans sent to internment camps during 
the war the last of the checks will be mailed in the federal 
governments fiscal year that begins oct 1 1992 
it was unclear exactly when the checks would go out but 
officials said last week they hoped to begin issuing them in early 
october if white house and congressional budget negotiators reached 
agreement on a budget that agreement was reached sunday and 
congress approved a resolution to continue funding for federal 
agencies averting furloughs and cuts that could have delayed 
issuing the checks 
mary grace jennings a spokeswoman for the federal office of 
redress administration said last week that officials hoped to have 
the first checks out by oct 9 
the office also has proposed that the checks be accompanied by a 
letter of apology signed by president bush and was working with the 
white house toward that she said 
for many the payments will do much to erase the shame of 
internment and the decades of bitterness that followed said 
cressey nakagawa president of the japanese american citizens 
league which led the fight for the reparations 
i think in many instances people will even frame the 
letter nakagawa said from his san francisco office the checks 
will be consequential but most meaningful will be the apology 
the government rounded up japaneseamericans in 1942 after war 
roke out with japan distrusting their loyalty germanamericans 
did not receive such treatment 
about 120000 people were forced to abandon nearly all their 
possessions and were confined at 10 camps most in remote inland 
areas of the west and at scattered hospitals and sanitariums 
among them was robert matsui who was 6 months old when he his 
sister and parents were sent to a camp despite all having been 
born and raised in sacramento calif they spent four years as 
internees 
matsui now a democratic congressman from california sponsored 
the repayment bill with rep norman mineta dcalif and sens 
daniel inouye and spark matsunaga both dhawaii 
passage of the measure was something of a catharsis for many 
japaneseamericans matsui said 
it was an issue of shame for the longest time he said 
the shame of having been accused by your own government of 
potentially being a spy the worst thing that could happen to a 
citizen is being accused of being disloyal to your neighbor 
it took years to square the experience in his own mind matsui 
said 
i was not able to deal with this issue for the longest time 
until about 1984 and 1985 when it really hit me that it really 
wasnt my fault that we were in this camp it was the governments 
fault he said 
the taxfree checks will be distributed according to age with 
yatsu and 84 other centenarians getting them first 
yatsu whose birthday is oct 13 isnt the oldest first in 
line are a woman in phoenix and a man in santa monica calif both 
107 said bob bratt administrator of the redress administration 
yatsu and harry nakagawa 100 are among five former internees 
cared for by seattle keiro a japanese community nursing home who 
have lived more than a century both men remember the war years 
well 
nakagawa who immigrated to seattle in 1905 had a successful 
grocery with his son when he and his family were sent to a camp in 
minidoka idaho he said his landlady let him keep his possessions 
in the stores basement but she died before his return and i 
lost everything he later worked in a hotel and private club in 
seattle 
yatsu a teacher who immigrated to california in 1906 spent the 
war at an arizona camp afterward he made his way to seattle where 
he worked for a window company 
yatsu said he would use his money to go live with a daughter in 
san diego nakagawa said he would donate some to the buddhist and 
baptist churches 
both speaking in a mix of english and japanese translated by a 
seattle keiro worker said they were amazed and pleased the 
government acknowledged its wrong 
its a good thing other american people think we were 
enemy people and they no like yatsu said 
the payments were authorized by the civil liberties act of 1988 
but 125 billion for the program wasnt allocated by congress 
until last october congress approved 500 million for 25000 
payments in fiscal 1990 the same amount the following year and the 
remainder beginning in october 1992 
that was based on estimates that about 65000 internees were 
alive in 1988 but bratt said his office had found about 70000 
nearly threequarters of whom live in california

top congressional and bush administration 
leaders trying to stave off a chaotic shrinking of government 
services ended more than 12 hours of negotiations early sunday 
still without a final plan to reduce the federal deficit 
all indications pointed to a final agreement sources said 
negotiators disposed of two of the toughest issues capital gains 
tax cuts and higher taxes on social security recipients by 
removing them from the package 
negotiations will resume at midday sunday 12 hours before deep 
cuts in many federal programs are due to take effect 
any tampering with social security a month before elections was 
just too unpalatable to most democrats and many republicans 
congressional aides said 
apparently the biggest remaining obstacle to a final agreement 
was determining how to enforce the proposed deficit reductions in 
future years that is how to keep a new congress in 1994 for 
example from reneging on the spending cuts 
aides said some who have been pushing hardest for a cut in the 
capital gains tax had made clear they would rather postpone the 
issue until next year rather than accept any of several 
watereddown substitutes 
there doesnt seem to be much life left in the issue this 
year one republican aide said of the capital gains cut which 
has been a prime goal of president bush since his 1988 election 
campaign 
an official traveling with the president in new york said he 
could not confirm reports that the white house had dropped its 
insistence on a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
negotiators were discussing all sorts of alternatives 
including indexing to protect people from being taxed on gains that 
simply reflect inflation 
it all depends on what they get for it he said 
a capital gains cut apparently fell victim to a democratic 
effort to portray the reduction as a windfall for the rich about 
80 percent of the benefit of a tax cut on capital gains which are 
investment profits would go to those with incomes over 100000 a 
year 
negotiators were optimistic they would be able to agree on a 
plan of targeted spending cuts and tax increases that would bring 
the largest deficit reductions in history 50 billion in the 
budget year that begins monday and another 450 billion over the 
following five years 
it may take until early tomorrow morning house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash told reporters as the saturday talks 
began im getting quite optimistic about it 
failure could trigger 85 billion in arbitrary cuts in many 
federal programs and forced furloughs of 1 million or more workers 
beginning monday morning the problem is made worse by the fact 
that congress has yet to pass any of the 13 annual appropriation 
bills that pay for government programs in the new year 
the house and senate scheduled sunday sessions in anticipation 
that their leaders would reach agreement on a deficitreduction 
plan if all goes according to schedule the two chambers would 
approve stopgap legislation extending government spending authority 
temporarily and president bush would sign it sunday night 
that would give lawmakers a few days to write a bill cutting 
spending and raising taxes to produce the deficit reduction 
as negotiators convened on saturday aides gave conflicting 
reports on the status of the capital gains cut which has been the 
most contentious issue in the more than four months of bargaining 
i would not want to preclude it at this time foley said 
saturday when asked if the capital gains proposal was still an 
option he said the whole question of growth incentives and tax 
fairness whether the rich should pay more was still open 
he and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said 
negotiators were considering alternative ways of stimulating 
investment aides said those options include a limited deduction 
for longheld investments in smaller companies 
by the time the session ended however the touchy capital gains 
issue had been put aside 
that left another hot issue whether social security 
beneficiaries should be required to shoulder a bigger portion of 
the cost of deficit reduction in the end the negotiators 
apparently said no 
democrats had proposed to raise from 50 percent to 85 percent 
the taxable portion of social security benefits received by those 
with higher incomes republicans favor a two or threemonth delay 
in the costofliving increase in social security benefits that is 
due to take effect next january 
leaders in both parties say either solution is likely to 
undermine support for the deficitreduction package from lawmakers 
who remember the flood of mail from retirees last year that forced 
repeal of a catastrophic illness health plan for seniors and the 
tax increases that paid for it 
the negotiators agreed earlier on large parts of the 500 
billion package it includes increases in taxes on beer wine 
liquor and gasoline a new luxury tax on highpriced cars 
jewels and electronic equipment a slight tax on all forms of 
energy 120 billion of cuts in domestic spending and a 170 
billion reduction in the military budget

the soviet union and south korea on sunday 
will announce plans to establish diplomatic relations south korean 
diplomats said 
the south korean diplomats said their foreign minister choi 
hojoong and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze would 
make the announcement after their meeting at the united nations 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said no date 
had been set for establishment of ties but it would be soon 
possibly as early as november 
soviet diplomats said only that the sovietkorean meeting would 
be important 
south korea has been pushing for ties with the soviet union a 
longtime ally and friend of its rival north korea one of the last 
bastions of hardline communism resisting the worldwide wave of 
democratic movements 
the soviet union which is undergoing political liberalization 
also has been improving its relations with south korea and the 
moscow government is eager for enhanced trade and economic 
cooperation to help bolster the soviet economy 
the two koreas have been archenemies since the korean peninsula 
was divided after world war ii they fought a 195053 war and 
hundreds of thousands of troops are positioned along their border 
the move is expected to enhance a south korean bid to join the 
united nations communist north korea has opposed separate entry of 
the two nations on the divided peninsula and says separate 
admission would only reaffirm division 
north korea and south korea currently hold nonvoting observer 
status at the united nations 
the soviet decision would leave china as north koreas most 
powerful communist ally but china too has been cautiously 
improving its relations with south korea and also is interested in 
south korean investment and technology 
south korean diplomats have said they would only seek un 
admission if they are certain that china a permanent member of the 
security council with veto power would not oppose them 
with the crumbling of the soviet bloc more eastern european 
nations are seeking normalization of relations with south korea

congressional leaders said they have all but 
reached a tentative agreement with the bush administration to slash 
500 billion off the federal deficit a deal that would stave off a 
chaotic shrinking of government services on monday officials said 
sunday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the budget 
negotiators have resolved all the tax questions and other issues 
but still have some questions about reforming the budget process 
that they need to discuss with bush 
fitzwater said only technical questions remained to be resolved 
he said the president will meet with negotiators at 1230 pm to 
hopefully conclude that final issue and get an agreement after 
that 
bush has insisted all along that he wanted the budget deal to 
include longterm reform that will tighten controls on the 
budgetary process 
other officials said negotiators disposed of two of the toughest 
issues capital gains tax cuts and higher taxes on social security 
recipients by removing them from the package 
theyre done gone said one democratic participant who 
demanded anonymity 
president bush was scheduled to fly back to washington from new 
york by early afternoon he had been in new york to deliver 
speeches and to meet with foreign officials 
bargainers were gathering in the capitol sunday morning to try 
to nail down the final details of the agreement still outstanding 
were procedural questions about how to guarantee agreedon spending 
limits in the last several years of the fiveyear package 
without a deal deep cuts in many federal programs are due to 
take effect monday 
white house officials said privately saturday night that if the 
president returned to the nations capital it would be to put the 
final seal on the major deficit cutting deal he and congressional 
leaders have been seeking for more than four months 
the officials said bush would leave for washington after 
speaking to the united nations childrens summit he was traveling 
on a small air force jet and planned to later return to new york 
where he had meetings scheduled with nine foreign heads of state 
bushs move came after congressional and white house leaders 
worked into the early morning hours in search of a 
deficitreduction agreement that would avert widespread curtailment 
of government services monday morning 
the negotiators planned to return later in the day 
weve made a lot of progress we just dont have a deal yet 
senate republican leader bob dole said early sunday at the end of a 
13hour negotiating session 
a spokesman for house speaker thomas s foley described the 
previous 24 hours as the most successful since these talks began in 
may 
talks were scheduled to resume at midday if an agreement is 
reached the house and senate would consider stopgap legislation 
later in the day to give the government new spending authority for 
the budget year that begins monday and to postpone furloughs of 
federal workers and cuts in government services for three or four 
days 
white house officials had previously indicated bush would return 
to washington to announce his backing for an agreement if one were 
reached 
democratic and republican leaders have acknowledged that the 
deficitreduction plan they are writing will be unpopular but they 
are betting lawmakers will swallow hard and accept it as better 
than the alternative of deep arbitrary cuts in many programs 
during the saturday session aides said negotiators agreed to 
eliminate from the package a proposed increase in the portion of 
social security benefits subject to income tax 
democratic negotiators especially had been cautioned by party 
members that they could not accept such a tax increase on retirees 
the bargainers also put aside president bushs proposed tax cut 
on capital gains which are profits from the sale of investments 
democrats insisted they could not accept that reduction whose 
benefits would go chiefly to higherincome americans unless other 
taxes on those same people were raised to make up the difference 
the package would reduce the deficit by about 50 billion during 
the budget year that begins monday and by another 450 billion 
during the following four years 
key parts of the package would 
raise taxes on gasoline all forms of energy cigarettes 
liquor wine beer and airline tickets 
impose a new 10 percent tax on part of the price of expensive 
cars electronic equipment furs jewelry and other luxuries 
boost the monthly premium retirees pay for medicare doctors 
services 
cut military spending by 170 billion over five years 
reduce outlays for education space the court system and many 
other programs by 120 billion 
early today bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
attended a service in a private chapel at st bartholomews 
episcopal church a landmark byzantine edifice just across the 
street from the waldorfastoria hotel where the president is

in the first days after president bush ordered 
american troops into the persian gulf washington was awash with 
speculation about the size of the deployment 10000 troops 
50000 
now with operation desert shield into its ninth week the 
magnitude of the us military buildup is clear roughly 
165000plus soldiers sailors and airmen 420 warplanes 50 
warships and its still growing 
even with this formidable presence military analysts say it 
will be another few weeks before the pentagon has arrayed enough 
heavy armor to launch a successful ground offensive against iraq 
complicating the military equation is the continued buildup of 
iraqi forces in kuwait and southern iraq estimated by the 
pentagon to total 430000 men as of sept 25 
were a long way from having any capability to do anything 
other than behave in a defensive way said jack merritt a 
retired army general and former us representative to the nato 
military committee 
in ordering us forces to saudi arabia on aug 7 bush said 
their mission was to deter an iraqi attack on the desert kingdom 
and in the event the iraqis invaded to defend the saudi oil 
fields 
the president has not ruled out an offensive strike to try to 
dislodge iraqi forces from kuwait and defense secretary dick 
cheney said friday it seemed increasingly likely that saddam 
hussein woul lash out with military force in response to the un 
trade embargo against his exportdependent country 
american forces currently are deployed in defensive positions in 
and around saudi arabia 
three us marine formations totalling more than 45000 
personnel are in position along saudi arabias gulf coastline and 
three army heavy armored units two brigades of the 24th 
mechanized infantry division plus the 197th mechanized infantry 
brigade are fully deployed in defensive positions in northeastern 
saudi arabia 
these components which currently form the backbone of us 
ground forces in saudi arabia are greatly outnumbered by personnel 
and heavy armor on the iraqi side 
i suspect itll be the first of november before there is 
really an offensive capability by the american forces said james 
blackwell a military analyst at the center for strategic and 
international studies a washington think tank 
the us air force already has gained numerical superiority over 
iraq there are at least 420 us warplanes including 14 f111 
longrange bombers and 22 f117a stealth fighterbombers deployed 
at about 30 bases in and around saudi arabia 
the overwhelming us air power facing iraqi forces is built 
around airborne warning and control system planes that carry a 
saucerlike radar above the fuselage and communications devices 
that link the field of battle into a single picture 
five american and five saudi awacs are in the area now the us 
navy also has several hawkeyes similar aircraft that take off from 
aircraft carriers to perform radar and communications roles 
the us naval fleet in the region totals about 50 vessels 
including four aircraft carriers the battleship uss wisconsin 
armed with 32 tomahawk cruise missiles is in the gulf and an 
estimated eight nuclear submarines are lurking in the area 
the army air force and navy also have placed special operations 
forces in the gulf these forces are trained in unconventional 
warfare tactics such as sabotage 
also arrayed against iraq are a variety of ground air and naval 
forces from more than 20 other countries including britain 
france egypt syria and morocco 
blackwell said the sealift of american military hardware is 
running at least a couple of weeks behind schedule mainly because 
of breakdowns by transport ships even so additional ground units 
are beginning to arrive in saudi arabia including 
the 3rd armored cavalry regiment from fort bliss texas which 
is equipped with hundreds of m1 abrams tanks and bradley fighting 
vehicles the lead elements of the 4500man unit left for saudi 
arabia on wednesday according to fort bliss spokesman brad rose 
the full unit should be there within two weeks 
one brigade of the hell on wheels 2nd armored division 
totaling about 3000 soldiers from fort hood texas began heading 
for the saudi desert last week according to base spokesman maj 
jesse seigal all are expected to meet up with their equipment 
which is arriving by sea within 10 days 
two brigades of the 1st cavalry division totaling about 6000 
soldiers also from fort hood began leaving for saudi arabia last 
week and the full force should be in place there in about 10 days 
also en route to saudi arabia from fort hood are at least 2000 
members of the 13th corps support command and several hundred 
members each from the 15th military intelligence battalion and the 
89th military police brigade seigal said 
the earliest us ground forces sent to saudi arabia were the 
82nd airborne division from fort bragg nc and the 101st 
airborne division from fort campbell ky they are the two most 
rapidly deployable of the armys major units 
the pentagon has announced no intention of deploying additional 
army divisions of the usbased forces the only major units 
still available for heavy ground operations in saudi arabia would 
be the 1st infantry division from fort riley kan the 4th 
infantry division from fort carson colo and the 5th infantry 
division from fort polk la

after months of embarrassing 
failures nasa will try again this week to launch a shuttle this 
time with a nuclearpowered satellte that will study the suns 
uncharted poles 
optimism abounds and with some reason the shuttle scheduled to 
lift off saturday morning discovery is the most recent 
spaceship to have flown and the only one in which fuel leaks have 
not been found 
right now i dont even feel weather can hold us up because 
weve been just doing everything right on time said astronaut 
bruce melnick one of five men assigned to the upcoming mission 
columbia has been grounded by dangerous hydrogen leaks since 
may atlantis since june nasa tried four times to send columbia on 
an astronomy mission before stopping two weeks ago to make way for 
discoverys highpriority flight 
nasa has until oct 23 to launch discovery with the european sun 
probe named for the legendary greek adventurer ulysses otherwise 
the 750 million mission will have to be put on hold for 13 months 
when earth is aligned properly again with the sun and jupiter 
the fourday mission already is more than four years late it 
originally was scheduled for may 1986 but was delayed indefinitely 
following the challenger explosion earlier that year 
the fact that discovery has a real clean history is 
encouraging said astronaut tom akers 
discoverys april flight that put the hubble space telescope 
into orbit was smooth and troublefree the missions success was 
overshadowed two months later however by discovery of a defective 
mirror on the 15 billion telescope 
new fuel lines have been installed between the orbiter and 
external tank the area where hydrogen leaked in the other two 
shuttles nasa officials said but little work was performed in 
discoverys engine compartment following the last flight lessening 
the likelihood that any repair work has caused any damage 
i dont have any problems at all worrying about the vehicle 
said akers who like melnick will be making his first shuttle 
flight the most apprehension that i feel is on my own personal 
performance i want to make sure i dont mess up 
six hours into the flight as discovery orbits 184 miles above 
earth akers will switch on the system releasing the satellite from 
the cargo bay 
a series of rapid engine firings will send the 807pound 
spacecraft hurtling toward jupiter at a speed of 34450 mph making 
it the fastest manmade object in relation to earth ulysses is 
expected to reach jupiter in february 1992 
the giant planets gravity will whip ulysses into an 
unprecedented orbit over the solar poles the closest the 
spacecraft will come to the sun is about 120 million miles 27 
million miles farther away from the sun than it is now on the 
launch pad 
ulysses is expected to pass over the suns south pole in 1994 
and the north pole the following year 
almost anything we learn with ulysses will be real learning 
its new weve never been there before said edgar page 
ulysses science coordinator for the european space agency which 
is conducting the mission with nasa 
scientists plan to examine the suns corona and magnetic field 
and solar wind and flares so far measurements have been made only 
over the suns equator 
to reach its destination ulysses will use electricity generated 
from nearly 237 pounds of decaying plutonium238 the only other 
time such a generator has flown on a shuttle was in october 1989 
when atlantis carried the jupiterbound galileo into space 
environmental activists opposed to nuclearpowered spacecraft 
asked a federal judge in washington on friday to stop the launch 
nasa which says it has no other option has until tuesday to 
respond 
the activists contend a challengerlike accident could shower 
deadly plutonium over florida nasa officials insist the chance of 
that happening is extremely small because of the generators 
numerous protective layers 
nasas dudley mcconnell author of an environmental impact 
statement on ulysses said there is a less than one in 1 million 
chance of an accident that would result in a plutoniumrelated 
death 
the slight chance of such an accident odds wont keep the 
astronauts families away saturday 
my family is going to be down there in florida standing 
underneath discovery waving goodbye as we go off the launch pad so 
i dont have any problems said discoverys commander dick 
richards i am confident in this system and that it doesnt 
provide any hazard to anybody on the ground

overworked underpaid compared with their peers in 
private practice and facing increasing threats from drug 
traffickers and disgruntled defendants federal judges are facing a 
crisis in the judiciary 
the situation is so bad that veteran jurists are resigning and 
the brightest lawyers are refusing to take their places saying the 
exalted status of a federal judge cant make up for what they 
consider to be a life under siege 
one of the most respected judges in the frantic southern 
district of florida resigned last week citing pressures and 
finances 
us district judge thomas e scott of miami decided to retire 
from the bench at the age of 42 after five years as a circuit judge 
and five more on the federal level 
the departure of a man widely thought of as having one of the 
top legal minds in florida was taken as an ominous sign in miamis 
legal community 
in losing tom scott were losing the equivalent of two 
judges said chief district judge james lawrence king if 
congress doesnt act soon it will leave the judiciary of south 
florida tattered and torn 
judicial workloads have more than doubled since 1969 with so 
many drug cases clogging the courts that civil litigants must wait 
years for a trial date 
nobody would have taken this job unless they anticipated 
working very hard and being underpaid but there are limits said 
chief judge thomas c platt of the eastern district in new york 
where where 12 judges grappled with 1010 new criminal cases this 
year or more than 84 new cases each 
according to figures from the judicial conference of the united 
states only six federal judges resigned or retired from the bench 
from 1958 to 1973 but from 1974 to 1988 59 federal judges left 
the bench 
across the nation some judges live under armed guard 24 hours a 
day and at least 295 threats against federal judges have been made 
since october 1989 according to the us marshals service 
judge scott will more than double his 96600 salary after he 
joins the miami law firm of steel hector and davis on oct 31 but 
he said his comparative pay as a judge was only one of his 
frustrations 
in his resignation speech thursday scott appealed for more 
support for judges in the war on drugs calling them unsung 
heroes in an ongoing ordeal 
constantly at odds with a congress that does not address its 
needs and problems they face a daily struggle against threats 
of physical violence overburdened crime calendars and limited 
resources he said 
while authorities believe a racial extremist was responsible for 
the package bomb that killed 11th circuit judge robert vance in 
georgia last december judges in florida are more concerned with 
international criminals who are used to terrorizing or bribing 
judges in their own countries scott said in a recent interview 
when you enter into the world of drug traffickers and the 
money and violence they represent its very scary said scott 
who drives a different route home each day from the federal 
courthouse in miami 
there doesnt have to be a threat he added you know that 
one day one of these decisions is going to come back to haunt 
you 
neal sonnett the immediate past president of the national 
association of criminal defense lawyers said scotts departure is 
a symbol of how drug cases have overwhelmed the system 
he worked enormously hard and this district is the busiest in 
the country sonnett said but all the judges down here spend 
7080 percent of their time on drug cases thats bound to wear on 
you 
the bush administration is expanding us attorneys offices 
nationwide but judges say the federal bench hasnt grown to meet 
the demand in criminal and civil matters especially in drugentry 
states like florida texas california and new york 
the load could be eased in some districts under a senate 
proposal to create 77 new judgeships and reduce the costs and 
delays of civil litigation the bill sponsored by judiciary 
chairman joseph biden ddel and sen strom thurmond rsc 
passed the committee in july 
federal judges salaries are also due for a rise to 120800 
in 1991 if the gulf crisis and deficitreduction battles dont 
prompt congress to rescind the pay raise 
sonnett said holding down salaries would only exacerbate a 
doublebarreled problem 
the best judges are starting to leave and the best lawyers 
are no longer interested in taking their place he said you 
run the risk of reducing the quality of the federal bench and 
allowing politics to creep in the federal judiciary should be 
above that

david souter may be able to maintain his 
modest lifestyle as a supreme court justice but theres no doubt 
that moving from weare nh to washington dc will require 
some adjustments 
if confirmed by the senate this month as expected souter will 
go from a community of 6000 to a metropolitan area of more than 
25 million from negligible crime to one of the nations highest 
murder rates and most important to souter from privacy into the 
public eye 
do you think that this guy who lives on a dirt road in weare 
new hampshire can possibly understand the problems of modern 
society longtime friend bill glahn said in a parody of attitudes 
hes encountered 
early media portraits of souter after his nomination to the 
supreme court focused on his unmown lawn old car and paintchipped 
mailbox weekly visits to his mother were noted as was his 
bachelor status 
many observers were concerned that his writings as a state judge 
didnt shed enough light on how he would vote on federal 
constitutional issues they worried that living in a state with no 
big cities and few minorities had sheltered souter from such 
realities as aids discrimination and urban crime both liberals 
and conservatives called him a risk 
sen warren rudman rnh said the early media zoom lens on 
souter created a phony image that changed during the confirmation 
hearings 
to some extent what those stories demonstrated was what i 
consider to be the arrogance of this city and the media who 
unfortunately have become part of the establishment and dont know 
it rudman said in a telephone interview from washington 
glahn a manchester lawyer acknowledged that souters 
wearetowashington transfer will require adjustments 
where he is theres no noise at night sometimes no lights at 
night no safety problems said glahn for david to drive from 
weare to concord there are probably two stop lights 
glahn said remaining in the public eye may be the most difficult 
thing for souter to become accustomed to 
he becomes of necessity a public figure glahn said hes 
a very private man and a very humble man i dont think he likes 
the notoriety 
souter leaves his weare farmhouse valued at around 150000 
for one of the nations most expensive housing markets his salary 
as an associate justice will be 118600 and will increase to 
148300 in january 
as a judge on the 1st us circuit court of appeals in boston 
where he served since may souter received 102000 annually 
all but one of the us supreme court justices live in the 
virginia suburbs of washington where fourbedroom homes in 
desirable areas average 300000500000 and can go well above the 
1 million mark 
rudman said souter initially will find a place near the court 
presumably on capitol hill so he can concentrate on work 
souter rudman said will maintain the same ascetic lifestyle 
david souter is not going to change hes not going to start 
being on the style pages of the washington post rudman said i 
can tell you that david souter wants to live a very quiet and 
modest life down here 
an avid hiker souter bereft of new hampshires white 
mountains probably will find solace in virginias nearby blue 
ridge range rudman said 
leaving friends will be difficult glahn said even though 
souter knows plenty of people in washington souter 51 may miss 
the closeness of new hampshire communities glahn said 
everyone knows you if you go to a store or restaurant they 
know what you want for dinner glahn said those are the kinds 
of things they take for granted in a small town 
souters sunday visits to his mother who lives in a retirement 
community in concord will be less frequent roundtrip airfare 
starts at about 207 glahn said helen souter 82 will miss her 
son but it will be a physical separation shes not 
concerned about it

a group of developers wants to block out urban 
crime by creating a town within the city complete with its own 
police force and a school system that would require weapons 
searches and drug tests 
the multimilliondollar plan drafted by the developers called 
partnership to reinvest in detroits excellence pride has yet to 
be handed over to the city but the mayor has expressed interest 
the proposed new town which would replace a crimbling 
neighborhood about 2 miles east of downtown would be a place 
where practical family values can flourish in an atmosphere free 
of drugs prostitution pornography gambling and other criminal 
activities the proposal says 
mayor coleman young met with the developers a few months ago and 
asked for more details of the plan city spokesman bob berg said 
sunday 
he backs the concept but he has not gone over the specifics 
berg said he has been saying that he supports the idea of 
redeveloping that area 
among the developers taking part in the project are major 
companies such michigan national corp a bank holding company and 
walbridge aldinger a leading construction company 
the 740acre community would border along the detroit river near 
belle isle according to the preliminary proposal obtained by the 
detroit news and described in sundays editions it would include 
the prime riverfront site of the former uniroyal plant 
the new town would be home to about 7500 people and would have 
a minigovernment under the city of detroit with authority to 
control the development and social programs the plan says the 
town would have a separate police department but it was uncertain 
how the city would be involved in the hiring or running of the 
force 
it would also have its own school district that would require 
checks for drugs and weapons 
several specifics were undetermined including how the project 
would be funded the developers said they would need complete 
cooperation with city state and federal governments 
the new town within a city concept was highlighted in a 1987 
detroit longrange plan and young has touted the idea for several 
years 
this is hope said david baker lewis who helped draft the 
1987 plan i dont think all the ideas are feasible or would be 
embraced but its a start 
the plan says the city would be asked to demolish buildings 
relocate residents clean up environmental hazards and relocate 
roads and utilities when that is completed the developers want 
the city to hand it over to them at no cost

nearly 1000 people forced from their 
homes because of a fire at a nearby chemical plant were allowed to 
return home early sunday authorities said 
explosions and flames broke out about 6 pm saturday at the 
tubilor protection of america plant which makes polyvinyl chloride 
thread protectors for pipes used in the oil business 
officials said the fire was allowed to burn itself out to 
protect firefighters and to prevent chemical runoff 
but fears of toxic fumes prompted authorities to order the 
evacuations of up to 1000 people living nearby montgomery county 
officials said the residents were allowed to return home at about 
130 am sunday 
it was the houston areas third industrial accident over the 
weekend 
a propane leak earlier saturday at a shell oil plant in deer 
park forced authorities to close a highway and order residents to 
stay inside 
and a norwegian tanker rammed a barge in the houston ship 
channel late friday spilling nearly 30000 gallons of partly 
refined crude oil into the water it had largly evaporated by 
sunday but authorities said they would still have to test to see 
if a solvent in the oil had contaminated oyster reefs in the bay 
firefighters from about a dozen area departments battled the 
chemical plant blaze two firefighters who suffered smoke 
inhalation were treated and released officials said 
several chemicals including the flammable gas methyl chloride 
are processed at the plant 
officials were investigating the cause of the fire at the 
chemical plant about 6 miles south of magnolia which is about 30 
miles northwest of houston

a search resumed sunday for the seventh 
victim of a plane crash that occurred when an uninvited aircraft 
appeared at a pilots convention gave an impromptu aerobatics 
display and plunged into a lake 
divers removed six bodies from the wreckage of the world war ii 
navy patrol plane which broke apart on impact in clear lake before 
hundreds of stunned spectators saturday afternoon 
believing a seventh person had been aboard divers renewed the 
search sunday morning and authorities said they would try to pull 
the plane from the mud and murky water 
just before the crash the bulky twinengine lockheed p2v 
harpoon made four low passes over the crowd on the shore and the 
floating seaplanes meeting for the annual seaplane flyin the 
lake is about 100 miles north of san francisco 
when it would go by he would put a cloud of smoke and then go 
away and straight up through the sky said debbie fields owner 
of a boat rental business this guy we were sitting with said 
he cant do that in that kind of plane 
the plane believed to date from 1945 was not part of the 
seaplane convention said walter windus vice president of the 
seaplane pilots association an event sponsor 
he was strictly an intruder said windus who saw the crash 
he saw an opportunity to show off and he took advantage of it he 
was doing air maneuvers that were not appropriate to that type of 
aircraft 
convention organizers he added tried desperately to contact 
the pilot of the mystery plane by radio planning to tell him to 
leave but could not reach him 
his behavior was so obnoxious windus said i was going to 
tell him to go away or i was going to report him to the faa 
on its last pass the plane did something similar to a barrel 
roll fields said adding there was no hope for him then he 
went straight down 
the plane crashed nosefirst into six feet of water about 50 
yards offshore on the lakes west end said walt smith a federal 
aviation administration official based in nearby santa rosa there 
were no survivors he said 
an investigator from the national transportation safety board 
arrived from los angeles on sunday morning 
the plane had taken off from the sonoma county airport in santa 
rosa south of lake county the los angeles times quoted an 
unidentified faa investigator as saying seven people were believed 
to be aboard the newspaper said earlier reports had put the 
number on board to as many as 10 
the names of the dead were not released but officials told the 
paper the pilot was from santa rosa 
scott landis an amphibiousplane pilot from long beach 
attending the convention said it appeared the harpoon pilot may 
have pulled the nose of the plane up too high on the final pass 
causing a stall 
the plane turned over and the nose fell back toward the lake 
the pilot tried to pull it out of the dive but there wasnt 
enough room said landis who estimated the plane was between 
1500 and 2000 feet when the nose dropped 
he hit the water at between 150 and 200 miles per hour 
probably he added the plane disintegrated

tens of thousands of ukrainian nationalists 
marched sunday through kiev the republics capital calling for 
greater independence from the central government in moscow 
mother moscow we want to be orphans declared a banner held 
aloft by cheering protesters as they streamed along the citys main 
street the kreshchatik 
the ukraine is one of 13 soviet republics that have taken steps 
toward greater autonomy from moscow the only one that has declared 
immediate independence is lithuania 
the ukraine is the secondlargest soviet republic after russia 
and is a key graingrowing area its parliament has declared 
sovereignty from moscow and claims the right to overrule national 
laws 
but nationalist groups want it to go further and take rapid 
moves toward secession 
on sunday interior ministry troops in armored personnel 
carriers and riot police wearing bullet proof vests guarded key 
buildings and intersections but the march was peaceful no clashes 
were reported by the soviet press or witnesses 
the militia showed a benevolent attitude everything was very 
orderly and there was no violence no arrests oleg zhukovsky a 
spokesman for the ukrainian nationalist group rukh said in a 
telephone interview after the rally 
a coalition between rukh and ukrainian prodemocracy groups 
organized the demonstration to press a series of demands connected 
with autonomy from moscow the coalition also called a oneday 
warning strike for monday 
among the demands are that ukrainian men drafted by the soviet 
army serve only in the ukraine that the ukraine refuse to sign a 
new union treaty between the 15 soviet republics and that the 
communist party be declared a criminal organization and 
stripped of influence in all ukrainian government organizations 
marchers yelled down with the union treaty and carried 
banners saying the communist party is a criminal clique and 
long live the communist party at the chernobyl power plant 
a contingent from the union of independent ukrainian youth 
carried a symbolic coffin bearing a photo of vladimir lenin and the 
words soviet empire 
other protesters held a blue and yellow ukrainian flag that had 
been blessed and presented to them by a ukrainian catholic priest 
turnout for the rally on a cold and overcast day was far below 
the 500000 people that organizers had predicted grigory 
maksimenko a rukh member estimated the crowd at 100000 oles 
fedorchuk a spokesman for the ukrainian inter party assembly put 
it at 75000 
the rally began at midafternoon in a square outside the citys 
main stadium where rukh said authorities had hastily ordered 
construction of a farmers market in an attempt to disrupt the 
demonstration 
after listening to speakers call for independence and condemn 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs attempts to forge a new 
union treaty the demonstrators marched along the kreshchatik 
toward lenin communist youth league square 
along the way they passed two statues of lenin which 
nationalist groups are seeking to remove 
nationalist groups in several other republics also are pushing 
for independence but regional officials have been reluctant to 
follow lithuanias example perhaps fearing economic sanctions 
similar to the ones that gorbachev imposed on lithuani last may 
lithuania was forced to close factories when the kremlin cut off 
supplies of oil natural gas and raw materials the embargo was 
lifted in exchange for the lithuanian parliaments agreement to 
suspend its march 11 declaration of independence pending 
negotiations which are scheduled to begin tuesday

sunday on two armies already battling each other with mortars and 
gunfire 
the fivenation west african force sent to end the war 
meanwhile reportedly sent warplanes on two bombing raids against 
positions of guerrilla chief charles taylor a rival of johnson 
the west african force is the most powerful in monrovia 
the british broadcasting corp said johnson told journalists in 
monrovia that negotiations had failed to end the 9monthold 
conflict and violence is the only solution

and blamed the west african force for failing to enforce the truce 
johnson said he planned attacks on taylors forces and the 
presidential mansion where remanants of slain president samuel 
does forces were holed up the bbc said

mortars into johnsons territory on saturday johnson said he was 
going to attack and capture government troops courtmartial them 
for war crimes and execute those found guilty

pope john paul ii on sunday opened a 
worldwide synod of bishops to discuss revitalizing the priesthood 
in the face of burnout challenges to celibacy and a shrinking 
number of interested candidates 
the pontiff inaugurated the monthlong assembly by celebrating a 
solemn mass in st peters basilica for some 1000 priests bishops 
and cardinals from around the world 
the synod an advisory body that meets to discuss major issues 
in the roman catholic church was called by john paul to discuss 
the formation of priests 
let me express the hope that your labors here will produce the 
abundant fruit which the ecclesiastical community is expecting 
the pope clad in gold robes and miter said in his homily 
he noted that bishops from china vietnam and laos were missing 
from the gathering and said he hoped they would join the synod 
later 
no reason was given for the absence of bishops jean khamse of 
laos and cambodia paul nguyen van hoa and emmanuel le phong thuan 
of vietnam and lucas liu hsientang of china the vatican says the 
church faces serious restrictions in those communist countries 
at the last synod in 1987 dealing with the laity vietnamese 
prelates arrived midway through the assembly 
the synod is expected to focus on the difficulty in maintaining 
the churchs rules that priests be celibate and foresake marriage 
in a world characterized by eroticism as a working document 
put it 
the rules themselves are not expected to be subjects for debate 
however as the pope has shown no indication they might be changed 
several sexual scandals have embarrased the church in recent 
months 
the archbishop of atlanta eugene a marino resigned in july 
following revelations of a twoyear intimate relationship with 
a young woman in newfoundland canada a report in july by a 
churchappointed commission said priests had sexually abused boys 
in the province for more than a decade 
some priests question this requirement celibacy and some 
candidates leave formation for this reason the working document 
said 
it noted that in public opinion celibacy is often 
incomprehensible and ridiculed a priest who accepts celibacy 
is sometimes looked upon in a strange way it said 
in this situation a priest can become totally isolated and 
misunderstood to the point of becoming deeply demoralized it 
said in some cases the crisis in the priestly identity can 
explain why priests leave the ministry 
the vatican cited the phenomenon of burnout from which 
priests of all ages seem to suffer they live in situations marked 
by tiredness resignation lack of creativity 
the document lamented the shortage of priests and declining 
number of candidates in some countries 
the shortage of priests carries the further consequence that 
those older priests who are still active might become overburdened 
thus making them subject to stress and to approach their work 
simply as functionaries it said 
according to the latest statistics there are 400000 priests in 
the world down from 406000 five years ago in the united states 
students in the last four years of seminary numbered 3698 this 
year compared with 7855 in 1968 
the 200 bishops at the synod included cardinal joseph bernardin 
of chicago cardinal james hickey of washington dc archbishop 
daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati and bishop john marshall of 
burlington vermont

an indian vessel docked at 
the southern persian gulf port of dubai on sunday with 705 weary 
evacuees from iraq aboard it was the second time in three weeks 
that baghdad had allowed such a sealift 
another indian ship the akbar with more than 1800 people 
aboard was en route to dubai from iraq 
both ships were searched during their journeys for materials 
prohibited under the un embargo against iraq us navy officials 
said 
at the other end of the persian gulf a third indian ship 
unloaded food and medicine at the iraqi port of umm alqasr the 
un sanctions committee allowed the 12972ton vishwa siddhi to 
deliver the supplies under a provision permitting humanitarian 
shipments 
in dubai children arriving aboard the tipu sultan clutched 
teddy bears some refugees greeted relatives whom they had been 
unable to contact since the iraqi invasion 
about 100000 of the 185000 indians in kuwait and iraq were 
believed to remain stranded 
its terrible said one indian who identified himself only 
as rocky of his journey we hardly drank good water aboard the 
ship 
his wife gracie seven months pregnant shrugged off the 
discomfort its nothing compared to the relief we feel coming 
here to dubai she said 
the first of four air india jets carrying the ships refugees to 
bombay took off sunday afternoon with the others to leave later 
air india said sunday it would cancel some other regularly 
scheduled flights during the next two weeks to concentrate on 
airlifting those fleeing kuwait 
many refugees expressed both joy and sadness at leaving kuwait 
where some had held wellpaid jobs now some face an uncertain 
future back home and they left most of their belongings behind 
they spoke of sharp hikes in food prices in kuwait one mother 
of two said the price of bread has doubled and is becoming scarce 
unlike the indian refugees who arrived on another vessel last 
month many of whom were exhausted to the point of collapse the 
latest evacuees seemed healthy despite the heat and shortage of 
good water 
the indian vessel alsafeer brought out 725 people earlier this 
month but the attempt to continue the sealift was held up when 
baghdad insisted the vessels bring in food and medicine despite the 
sanctions 
a us navy official in the persian gulf confirmed the boarding 
of the akbar and said the tipu sultan also had bee searched en 
route the official who asked that his name not be used said 
boarding teams found papers in order and no prohibited material 
aboard

a founder of the governing party quit 
parliament on sunday to protest prime minister vp singhs plan to 
reserve nearly half of government jobs for lowcaste hindus 
the plan has ignited weeks of riots in which at least 50 people 
have been killed in clashes with police 
in addition nearly a score of uppercaste students have 
committed suicide leaving notes blaming singh 
devi lal a founder of the governing janata dal party said he 
was resigning to protest the style timing and manner in which 
the prime minister had adopted the job quota plan 
he released a letter accusing singh of undue haste and 
failing to consult his cabinet or the parties supporting the 
10monthold minority coalition 
i cannot support the government which is so insensitive to the 
cries of dying children and is leading the country to 
fragmentation said the letter it accused singh of preparing 
the ground for civil war 
devi lal handed his letter to singh at a meeting of 
parliamentarians from the minority national front coalition after 
he left the meeting gave the prime minister a vote of confidence 
four of devi lals supporters objected to the procedure and walked 
out 
devi lals seat remains vacant until a special election is held 
before sunday the janata dal controlled 136 seats in the 529seat 
lower house of parliament and its coalition partners have three 
seats 
enmity between singh and devi lal has mounted for months but 
singhs party now appears more openly split than before 
singh fired devi lal from his position as deputy prime minister 
aug 1 after weeks of political infighting 
six days later singh suddenly announced the job policy in what 
analysts read as an attempt to upstage the populist devi lal just 
before he held a massive rally to demonstrate his support among the 
rural poor and underprivileged classes 
on saturday about 20 of devi lals supporters in the janata dal 
prepared a memorandum condemning singhs leadership and suggesting 
that he resign but devi lals resignation sunday came as a 
surprise 
also sunday news agencies reported six more students died from 
selfinflicted injuries raising to 19 the number of suicides in 
the past 11 days 
the policy reserves 27 percent of civil service positions for 
people from backward castes as defined in a 10yearold government 
report another 225 percent already had been set aside for the 
lowest level of society the outcastes and the tribespeople 
hindus who comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million people 
are divided into four main castes and thousands of subcastes which 
set social standing according to birth caste often determines 
profession education opportunities and income levels 
the government says it promoted the plan to counteract 
discrimination and win social justice for the historically deprived 
castes uppercaste students say they will suffer reverse 
discrimination and lose jobs for which they are better qualified 
the government employs about 18 million people official figures 
say more than 13 million indians are unemployed about 5 million of 
them are classified as educated

ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
went before a special tribunal sunday and professed her innocence 
on corruption charges brought by the armybacked caretaker 
government to try to ban her from politics 
ms bhutto was ordered to stand trial before the special 
onejudge court on charges of misconduct and abuse of power during 
her 20 months in office 
thousands of sloganchanting wellwishers waited outside the 
sindh high court building for ms bhutto who was dressed in a 
brightpink tunic and trousers and clutched a prayer written by a 
supporter 
the 37yearold former prime minister said she did not recognize 
the jurisdiction of the tribunals the courts were originally 
established following a 1977 military coup and resurrected last 
month by the caretaker government 
i have come here to show the people the hollowness and 
maliciousness of the whole process ms bhutto said before 
entering the courtroom 
i have come here because i want to make a point that the 
former prime minister and the leader of pakistans biggest 
political party is being dragged from court to court she said 
this is aimed at keeping us from fighting the election 
about 1000 people jammed the benches aisles and window sills 
to watch the proceeding 
ms bhutto sat quietly during the hearing listening to her 
lawyers and occasionally scribbling notes 
the former prime minister has been ordered to stand trial on 
similar charges this week before a special tribunal in the eastern 
city of lahore the capital of punjab province and a stronghold of 
her political opponents 
she could be disqualified from the oct 24 parliamentary 
elections and banned from politics for seven years if convicted on 
any charge 
justice wajihuddin ahmed promised the proceedings would not 
hamper the campaign he adjourned the trial until oct 10 
the charges allege ms bhutto illegally used an asia development 
bank loan to hire a foreign consulting firm to oversee a karachi 
power project and allowed a britishbased firm to export cotton at 
rates far below the international market rate 
the former prime minister has denied any wrongdoing and accused 
the president and the caretaker government of launching a witch 
hunt against her her government and her leftleaning pakistan 
peoples party 
ms bhutto spent nearly six years in prison under house arrest 
or in exile after her father the late prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto was overthrown by the military in 1977 and hanged two years 
later 
she was elected to parliament in november 1988 in the first 
free elections in more than a decade and became the first woman to 
lead a modern moslem nation 
president ghulam ishaq khan using his constitutional power 
dismissed ms bhuttos government on aug 6 and installed a 
caretaker government made up largely of her opponents 
ishaq khan accused ms bhuttos government of corruption 
incompetence and abuse of power 
the caretaker government says it has substantial documentary 
evidence to back up the charges 
but many pakistanis believe the charges have generated a wave of

rapid action force which will be based in the northeastern desert

thousands of militant serbs seized 
weapons from a police station in ongoing struggles over autonomy 
for the serbian minority in the croatian republic according to 
authorities and news reports sunday 
police sealed off the town hall in dvor after about 1000 serbs 
seized arms and ammunition from the police friday night the 
clashes there and in two other towns left one policeman seriously 
injured 
at least 27 people were arrested the reports said 
meanwhile the armed forces threatened unspecified urgent 
steps against the independenceminded republic of slovenia whose 
parliament moved friday to strip the federal government of control 
over the republics defenses 
president borisav jovic a serb who holds the annually rotating 
chairmanship of yugoslavias collective presidency announced he 
would cut short his visit to the united nations in new york 
because of the deterioration of the political and security 
situation at home the state news agency tanjug said 
the announcement referred indirectly to slovenias actions 
friday the defense ministry appealed saturday to the president to 
take action to keep federal forces intact 
yugoslavians are at odds over the future of the countrys 
fragile sixrepublic federation the republics are fractured along 
religious ethnic economic and political lines 
croatia and slovenia want the country to be changed into a 
looser confederation of sovereign states 
serbia seeks to maintain tighter central control and even to 
change its border with croatia to incorporate serbs living there 
the rivalry between serbs and croats has escalated sharply since 
a centerright government ousted the communists in free elections 
in croatia last spring 
serbs make up about 10 percent of the population of the croatian 
republic but are the majority in some towns croatias authorities 
last month rejected calls for greater autonomy for some serbian 
strongholds 
several hundred serb women and children said by tanjug to fear 
special croatian police units spent saturday night huddled in army 
barracks in petrinja about 25 miles south of croatias capital 
zagreb

th8e town and schools were ordered closed until the police units 
leave town

knin another croatian town dominated by serbs had been blocked 
off by serbian militants some of the militants were threatening to 
cut off roads to the coast unless people arrested over the weekend 
were freed

the united states and the soviet union have 
begun drafting resolutions to authorize the use of military force 
against iraq if a worldwide economic squeeze does not force a 
retreat from kuwait us officials said sunday 
both superpowers would move against iraq under un auspices 
but the soviets prefer to work under a joint military command while 
the united states prefers more logistical leeway the officials 
told the associated press 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has repeatedly 
cautioned iraq that the military option might be taken consulted 
last week with more than a dozen foreign ministers attending the 
un general assembly session 
they included the british french west german japanese 
canadian and italian ministers who met with baker over dinner 
wednesday night iraqs occupation of kuwait which is resisting a 
freeze on trade ordered aug 6 by the un security council was 
the main topic 
a lot of ideas are kicking around a us official said 
everybody is asking what we will do next 
the official said the drafting at this point was tentative 
back of the envelope stuff is the way he described it 
everybody is looking at options he said 
the officials said other delegations also have begun drafting 
proposed resolutions all with the view of being ready to act 
against iraqi president saddam hussein to restore kuwaits national 
legitimacy 
there was no indication when the council would be asked to take 
up a call for action 
besides the economic boycott the council has approved a 
military blockade and last tuesday an embargo on air traffic 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
bush administration was inclined to act under article 42 of the 
un charter instead of article 51 which affirms the right of 
selfdefense 
article 42 authorizes action by air sea or land forces as 
necessary to retain or restore international peace or security 
the soviet union which is cooperating with the bush 
administration against iraq is taking a harder line toward saddam 
in plotting military action the officials said 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze signaled a tough stance 
sunday saying we are a permanent member of the security council 
and we will comply with any decision with any resolution of the 
security council 
shevardnadze interviewed on nbctvs meet the press added 
that would include anything regarding the involvement of the 
soviet troops under the flag under the auspices of the united 
nations 
in principle shevardnadze said he would like to see the use of 
force ruled out but he said if extreme conditions develop 
then any decision must be taken within the framework of the 
security council 
shevardnadze stressed that the un military staff committee 
must be involved if force is used against iraq 
within the bush administration meanwhile senior officials are 
intensifying the threat of force if economic sanctions do not 
compel iraq to withdraw from the oilrich emirate 
on friday brent scowcroft the presidents assistant for 
national security said the systematic destruction of kuwait 
under iraqi occupation is shortening the time that the united 
states can wait for sanctions to drive out the iraqi army 
president bush will have a chance on monday to coordinate 
strategy with moscow during an afternoon meeting with shevardnadze 
baker will then see the soviet foreign minister on wednesday their 
third meeting in less than a week

families of victims in the crash of 
pan am flight 103 say they hope a public inquiry opening monday 
the first in the case will help determine how the bombing might 
have been prevented 
the inquiry is expected to look at airport security lapses but 
it wont seek to assess criminal responsibility for the crash 
families of some of the 270 victims want the investigation to 
cover security not just at londons heathrow airport but also at 
frankfurt west germany where the flight originated 
the boeing 747 was bound for new york when it blew apart over 
the small scottish town of lockerbie on dec 21 1988 eleven of 
the victims were people on the ground 
investigators say there is not enough evidence to prosecute 
anyone for the attack but they have pursued clues pointing to 
radical palestinians 
the public inquiry run by a scottish judge will be held in 
dumfries 12 miles from lockerbie the proceedings expected to 
last three months are being held in a hall converted into a 
courtroom 
the inquiry will take evidence on the planes airworthiness air 
traffic control the emergency response the deaths the 
destruction of the aircraft and security arrangements the 
scottish office said 
in a key ruling at a preliminary hearing sept 20 the judge 
rejected efforts by the british government and pan am to restrict 
evidence to britain the judge sheriff principal john s mowat 
ruled that evidence from pan am baggage handlers at frankfurt 
airport would be admissible if it he thought it relevant 
after the preliminary hearing jim swire who heads a relatives 
group called uk familiesflight 103 said he was much more 
optimistic about getting a fair hearing on how the bombing could 
have been prevented 
we have not wavered from our determination to see british 
security examined in at least the same detail as us security has 
been and we cant imagine why theyve waited 21 months even to 
start said swire his 24yearold daughter flora was killed in 
the bombing 
a us presidential commission which spent nine months 
investigating the crash reported in may that the destruction of 
flight 103 may well have been preventable 
the commission cited lapses in security including failure to 
physically search luggage transferred from other airlines it said 
no effort was made to ensure that all bags were accompanied by 
passengers 
its report called for notification of passengers when there is a 
credible bomb threat and said the united states should consider 
military strikes or covert operations against air terrorists 
swire said the families have much greater confidence in the 
scottish judiciary which is separate from the english judiciary 
we feel sure it will treat us fairly and we intend to give it 
an opportunity to do so swire said in an interview friday 
the british government has rejected the families request for an 
independent investigation saying all necessary ground would be 
covered by the continuing police investigation and the public 
hearing 
scottish investigators have said they are investigating ahmed 
jibrils radical palestinian group the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command and mohammad abu talb a 
member of another radical palestinian group jailed in sweden for 
bombings in northern europe 
other unidentified individuals and groups are also under 
investigation 
police say the bomb was hidden inside a radiocassette recorder 
in a suitcase that was probably put aboard the flight in frankfurt 
baggage was transferred from a boeing 727 to a larger boeing 747 
when the flight stopped at heathrow

inside a dusty tent sheltered from gritty 
desert winds a dozen indian officials toiled sunday on a 
bureaucratic assembly line to ready passports for weary refugees 
outside along rows of olive green army tents painted a reddish 
yellow by the desert sand about 13000 indian refugees in a 
transit camp waited and waited some more 
even in this barren wasteland the bureaucracy is slow and 
agonizing 
we were called out at 3 am and told to assemble with our 
belongings said george thomas a 39yearold indian engineer who 
left kuwait six days ago and is waiting for his passport to be 
processed 
some buses came some people left but many were left behind 
now our embassy tells us to go back to our tents and wait for 
further instructions 
maybe it was a misunderstanding between our officials and the 
jordanian police allowed thomas we find the indian embassy 
hasnt coordinated all the transfers they are supposed to call us 
by the repatriation numbers attached to each passport but they 
never follow them 
inside one tent blueturbaned indian diplomat gs chhokra 
between assignments in helsinki and madrid continued his work he 
quickly and steadily processed passports as he talked to two 
reporters 
chhokra said that so far 81000 indian refugees from iraq and 
kuwait had been repatriated from jordan he said he hoped 3400 to 
3500 others would leave for home sometime sunday 
the indian government believes it can complete the evacuation of 
all indians including those remaining in iraq and kuwait by oct 
10 he said 
we are working 12 to 14hour shifts with no saturdays or 
sundays off said chhokra i have never worked so hard 
but some refugees forced to bide their time and endure the 
boredom of the desert camp wonder aloud if the diplomats work hard 
enough 
those who have influence go first complained p 
radakrishnan a 40yearold construction worker who has waited four 
days for a flight home to bombay 
if you dont have influence you dont go at all they have not 
gone yet he said nodding to the other men in his tent they 
have no influence 
such sentiments led to a brief but violent episode last week 
when refugees stormed a minibus that they erroneously believed was 
taking the relatives of an indian official to the airport 
chhokra without looking up from his work on the passports 
dismissed the complaints as baseless 
human nature being what it is everybody wants to go earlier 
than the others he said 
the desert bureaucracy like those elsewhere works invisibly 
and seemingly mysteriously at least to the thousands forced to 
wait in tents and food lines 
the red tape compounds the misery of people who already have 
lost everything 
we got out of our tents when we heard the police calling on us 
to get going said one indian caught up in the confusion over the 
buses on sunday 
as soon as we left our tents the newcomers came in and started 
grabbing everything said the man who would identify himself only 
as james 
now we must stay and some of the things they took are very 
dear such as food blankets and kerosene stoves he added more 
out of frustration than bitterness there is no way we can get 
those things back

the soviet union and south korea 
established full diplomatic relations sunday in what was seen as a 
major victory for the seoul government and a devastating setback 
for communist north korea 
the soviet union has been a major ally and arms provider for 
north korea 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his south korean 
counterpart choi hojoong signed an agreement establishing the 
ties issued a joint communique and stood together in a un 
corridor smiling and answering questions 
we have agreed to establish diplomatic relations between the 
soviet union and south korea as of today choi later told a news 
conference 
he said both sides had agreed to an exchange of highlevel 
visits possibly by heads of state but no date was set he said a 
soviet trade and economic delegation will visit seoul next month to 
discuss broad economic cooperation 
we believe that establishing diplomatic relations between the 
soviet union and south korea will aid the cause of stability in 
asia and the pacific region shevardnadze told reporters he 
called south korea an important factor for peace in the region 
shevardnadze added that improved relations with south korea 
would not adversely affect soviet relations with any other state 
an indirect reference to north korea 
there was no immediate comment from north korean diplomats at 
the united nations the move was widely seen as a diplomatic blow 
to pyongyang which has become increasingly isolated amid the 
recent trends elsewhere toward democracy and liberalization 
south korea has long been pushing for ties with the soviet 
union and moscow has been eager for enhanced trade and economic 
cooperation to help bolster the sinking soviet economy 
moscow and seoul have signed agreements on trade economic 
investments transfer of technology and other cooperation 
bilateral trade was 600 million in 1989 and is expected to reach 
1 billion this year 
the soviet decision would leave china as north koreas most 
powerful communist ally but china too has been cautiously 
improving its relations with south korea and is interested in south 
korean investment and technology 
choi said he hoped the development would spur china to establish 
full diplomatic ties with seoul 
we hope this move will help end relations of confrontation and 
competition between the north and south he said 
both koreas currently hold nonvoting observer status at the 
united nations 
sundays move was expected to give south korea more leverage in 
its bid to join the united nations as a full member separately from 
north korea the north has opposed separate entry saying it would 
only reaffirm the division between the nations 
south korean diplomats have said they would only seek un 
admission if they are certain that china a permanent member of the 
security council with veto power would not oppose them

two journalists whose deaths 
were reported as traffic fatalities were apparently killed by 
gunfire a churchrelated human rights agency reported sunday and 
it demanded a government investigation 
the bodies of the two salvadoran reporters pedro martinez 28 
and jorge euceda 38 were found in their car friday on the pan 
american highway 27 miles east of san salvador 
there was definitely a criminal hand in this but many things 
remain to be cleared up said maria julia hernandez director of 
the roman catholic churchs legal aid office 
police reports blamed the deaths on a traffic accident but 
hernandez said her office had demanded an autopsy that showed 
martinez had bits of ammunition in his left eye and cuts on the 
sides of his body 
they shot at the journalists and some bullet fragments lodged 
in the face making him lose control of the vehicle he was 
driving hernandez said 
the blood on the pavement and the absence of it inside the 
vehicle could mean that the journalists were dragged out of the 
automobile and then beaten to death she added 
hernandez said no there were no suspects 
the deaths immediately aroused the suspicions of reporters who 
requested the assistance of legal aid the news media and relatives 
of the victims have called for a complete investigation of the 
deaths 
martinez was director of the magazine semana week and 
correspondent for the prestigious mexican magazine proceso 
euceda was a contributor to the diario latino the most liberal 
salvadoran daily newspaper and a professor in the journalism 
department at the national university of el salvador

most new yorkers took the historic un summit 
in stride along with the traffic delays caused by dozens of 
limousines clogging the city some tourists however resented the 
intrusion on their vacations 
why did this have to happen on my vacation said linda katz 
of pittsburgh as a police officer turned her away from a street 
leading to the united nations complex i had no idea this was 
going on 
most motorists pulled aside to make way for dignitaries some 
accompanied by police escorts traveling to the united nations in 
midtown manhattan limousines were double and even tripleparked 
on some streets 
bicyclists and pedestrians navigated past the police lines set 
up around the united nations and waited for a glimpse of a visiting 
leader arriving at the front entrance 
protesters were also on hand sunday as they had been all 
weekend 
more than 400 demonstrators carrying small black coffins 
bearing the names of slain children on sunday protested el 
salvadoran president alfredo cristianis participation at the world 
summit for children 
the new york committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador rallied in front of the el salvadoran un mission at noon 
before leading a mock funeral procession down park avenue near the 
united nations 
we dont think cristiani has any right to speak said 
michele ascione 27 one of the committee organizers hes 
responsible for thousands of atrocities against children in el 
salvador 
there were no arrests at the protest police said 
a smaller group protested against bangladesh president hussain 
mohammad ershad 
police said fewer people that expected gathered near the united 
nations 
there doesnt seem to be as much interest as we thought in the 
summit said officer scott bloch 
but darwin deleon 12 who sat on a corner a few blocks from the 
united nations knew all about the summit and applauded it 
i think its good they all came here to talk about kids 
because maybe theyll get something done said deleon whose boy 
scout troop helped distribute welcome boxes at the united nations 
prior to the summit they ought to do something about the third 
world i saw pictures of children with their bones sticking out 
karen krenzin who brought her mother husband and 18monthold 
daughter jesse on an afternoon stroll to the united nations said 
the summit would likely only be symbolic 
its good that theyre meeting but it does seem as if theyll 
just decide to give more american tax dollars to other countries 
said krenzin the problem with other countries is that they have 
too many children 
more than 70 kings presidents and prime ministers forged a 
multibillion dollar strategy at the un summit to help children 
described by participants as the worlds most precious resource 
president bush addressed the world leaders sunday morning 
urging nations around the world to live up to our

an inch of rain helped quell a fire that has 
consumed more than 11000 acres of the okefenokee swamp but it was 
not nearly enough to douse the blaze officials said sunday 
that one inch will probably hold it down for a little while 
said jim burkhart spokesman for the okefenokee wildlife refuge 
but its not going to be enough to keep the fire down 
the fire has burned 11300 acres since it began with a sept 1 
lightning strike burkhart said the swamp covers more than 700000 
acres with 396000 acres in the refuge and 356000 acres in a 
federally designated wilderness 
trenches dug in an effort to contain the blaze were holding up 
sunday burkhart said but a crew of 500 firefighters still must 
contend with a big flank of fire out in the swamp itself 
the fire was burning primarily in the southwest part of the 
okefenokee which currently is drier than it has been at any time 
since 318000 acres of swamp and adjacent timberland burned in 
195455 
average rainfall in the okefenokee is 53 inches per year 
rainfall is 175 inches below normal so far this year and 24 inches 
for the last two years before saturdays rain only 08 inch of 
rain had fallen in september officials said 
all public use of the refuge and the stephen foster state park 
on its west side was cut off the okefenokee swamp park a private 
attraction on the north edge of the swamp remained open

leaders meeting at the united nations moved to shore up diplomatic 
efforts against his country

move against iraq under un auspices if other measures failed but 
moscow wanted a joint military command while washington preferred

claims against iran that had been a major stumbling block to 
reaching an iraniraq peace the neighbors fought a bloody war from

reduced in the gulf if dialogue replaces the policy of threats 
and warnings if the language of peaceful politics replaces the 
policy of troop buildups and threats of the use of force

he again linked any solution to israels withdrawal from the 
occupied gaza strip and west bank and the pullout of syrian forces 
from lebanon

the possibility of using president francois mitterrands ideas as

the united states has nearly four times the 
number of mammography machines it needs contributing to the high 
cost of breast cancer detection federal researchers said 
researchers from the national institutes of health and the food 
and drug administration reported in mondays annals of internal 
medicine that the excessive equipment and high cost of the test may 
hinder increased use of mammography machines which detect breast 
cancer 
despite an increasing trend in usage that we project we found 
that the supply of dedicated mammography machines is outrunning the 
need said lead author martin l brown of the national cancer 
institute 
an editorial accompanying the report warned that the abundant 
supply may not improve health care 
the oversupply of mammography units may ultimately lead to a 
situation in which more care does not mean better care and it 
certainly is unlikely to mean more costeffective care said dr 
alvin mushlin of the university of rochester medical center 
researchers estimate that each year 150000 american women 
develop breast cancer and about 44000 die from the disease breast 
cancer rates could be lowered about 30 percent if women received 
mammograms as recommended by the national cancer institute 
according to several earlier studies 
although an estimated 10000 mammography machines were installed 
in us medical facilities by 1990 only about 2600 are really 
needed the study said 
brown said the studys estimate was based on accepted 
recommendations for screening mammograms nationwide figures on the 
number of machines and an average cost of about 100 per test 
even with some followup diagnostic tests we cant come close 
to accounting for all those machines brown said 
the high number of machines reduces the number of clients per 
machine keeping costs high he said money spent on the excess 
machines could be better spent on recordkeeping and followup 
care he said 
if the cost of the test was lowered from 100 to 50 by using 
fewer machines the country could save 763 million a year in 
health costs he said 
mushlin said the study indicates clearly that the supply of 
mammography machines far exceeds the needed number and predicted 
that the gap would only increase 
the nci is now conducting a nationwide survey of all facilities 
with mammography machines to further examine the issues raised by 
the study brown said 
although the study did not analyze the reasons for the rapidly 
increasing number of mammography machines brown speculated that 
hospitals perceive that the demand for breast cancer screening will 
continue to grow while the cost of the machines themselves is 
relatively low 
a cdc survey earlier this year found that 64 percent of women 40 
and older have had a mammogram up from 37 percent in 1987

new england patriots owner victor kiam on sunday 
promised mammoth changes in the football teams management 
after a sports reporter said she was sexually harassed by players 
in the locker room 
kiam said he was misled by my own people about the 
seriousness of the incident and again offered his apologies to 
reporter lisa olson while the two appeared on nbctvs nfl 
live 
olson said on sept 17 several patriots players made lewd 
comments while she was conducting postgame interviews in the 
locker room kiam originally brushed aside the comments saying 
it was a flyspeck in the ocean 
but on sunday he said he was calling upon patriot players to 
come forward with more information about the exchange 
there will be mammoth changes in the patriots management 
kiam said without elaborating i have just met with lisa im 
not ready yet to determine what i will do to the fullest extent 
national football league commissioner paul tagliabue said later 
sunday he told kiam not to make changes until the nfls 
investigation of the incident is complete 
a patriots player was fined in connection with the incident 
olson a reporter for the boston herald said kiams apology 
was a start 
kiam placed fullpage advertisements sunday in boston and new 
york newspapers theres no excuse for what happened in the 
locker room the ads said but kiam also asserted i never 
called lisa olson a bitch 
kiam was reported to have called olson a classic bitch in 
the locker room after a game kiam denied he used those words and 
the newspaper ads quoted three university officials who say they 
were next to kiam and did not hear him use those words 
the boston chapter of the national organization of women has 
condemned both the football team and kiam and suggested that women 
boycott products made by remington kiams connecticut company 
which makes electric shavers 
kiam said his apology to olson last week came before any 
boycott was mentioned

india and pakistan have temporarily 
suspended talks seeking to reduce border tension in the troubled 
kashmir region a pakistani foreign ministry official said sunday 
talks are still on but no date for a further round has been 
set foreign secretary shaharyar m khan said 
pakistan wanted the third round of negotiations to be held 
before midoctober but india objected and proposed a session later 
in the month pakistan however will hold parliamentary elections 
oct 24 and officials did not want the talks to coincide 
both countries are scheduled to attend a november summit of 
south asian nations so direct talks on kashmir probably wont be 
scheduled before december senior asian diplomats said 
more than 1200 people have died this year in escalating 
violence linked to a moslem insurgency in the indian province of 
jammukashmir other parts of the territory are controlled by 
pakistan 
new delhi accuses pakistan of aiding militant forces demanding 
independence pakistan denies the charge but says it supports the 
kashmiris right to selfdetermination 
about 65 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are moslem 
about threequarters of indias population is hindu 
the united states and other western countries have urged the 
traditionally hostile neighbors to work toward resolving the 
conflict which began with the 1947 partition of colonial india 
into predominantly moslem pakistan and the mostly hindu india 
the two countries have twice gone to war over the territory in 
194748 and in 1965 the wars have left kashmir divided into 
pakistani and indian sectors 
they fought a third war in 1971 over bangladesh then called 
east pakistan pakistan has lost all three wars

once again an 11thhour budget compromise has 
delayed fiscal chaos but the agreement that president bush 
insisted on sunday was not smoke and mirrors will still leave a 
gaping budget deficit 
for it to work the agreements major initial impact must be 
psychological it must give financial markets enough confidence 
that interest rates will begin a downward slide 
even though the plan announced at a hastily summoned rose garden 
ceremony holds out the promise of deeper savings down the road it 
will not prevent the fiscal 1991 deficit from setting a new record 
for redink spending 
ironically even as congressional and white house budget 
negotiators were putting the finishing touches on the deal to pare 
the federal deficit by 40 billion in the new fiscal year budget 
officials were upping the estimate of the deficit by a similar 
amount 
just a week ago budget negotiators were talking about a 250 
billion shortfall in the absence of spending cuts and tax 
increases 
now there is a budget agreement but even its enactment by no 
means certain would produce a deficit of some 254 billion 
thats because on sunday budget director richard darman 
increased the estimate for the fiscal 1991 deficit to 2937 
billion 
thats up from the 100 billion he estimated in january and the 
231 billion he estimated in july he blamed economic performance 
and the spiraling costs of the savings and loan bailout for the 
latest upward revision 
and that new figure assumes that oil retreats from its current 
40abarrel to 2124 that war doesnt break out in the middle 
east and that the economy doesnt totter into a recession 
so the final figures could be even worse 
compare the 253 billion level with the target in the 
grammrudman budget balancing law of 64 billion 
it would take spending cuts of some 130 billion to get spending 
in line with that target not the 40 billion of the agreement or 
the 100 billion talked about over the past few weeks 
under the budget compromise the 64 billion figure and all the 
other grammrudman targets would be abandoned and new targets 
established that would give the government five additional years to 
reach a balanced budget beyond the 1993 deadline called for in the 
present law 
thus the balanced budget that president reagan once promised by 
1983 is receding from grasp again 
now budget negotiators dont envision a budget in balance until 
near the end of the century 
the markets are not looking at the grammrudmanhollings 
targets as if thats reality the ones in current law darman 
said 
no one really believes were on a path to meet those 
targets he conceded thats been obvious for months if not 
more than a year 
thats not to say the measures contained in the compromise wont 
amount to a heavy dose of medicine that will be hard for many 
americans to swallow 
the pact calls for a 12cent increase in the ninecent gasoline 
tax and sharply higher taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages 
it would make medicare coverage more expensive and allows many 
government programs to rise only with the rate of inflation 
for the wealthy and upper middleclass taxpayers the package 
would have much same effect as an income tax rate increase by 
limiting the deductions that can be claimed by those making more 
than 100000 annually either single taxpayers or joint filers 
and the measure would impose new taxes on the sale of luxury 
items including boats and expensive cars but not highend 
electronic equipment as once contemplated 
it is not a phony smokeandmirrors deficitcutting program 
bush said sunday vowing to take the package to the american 
people 
just two days ago he was telling republican audiences in the 
midwest that the case he would take to the american people was the 
one against democrats in congress 
bush made two major concessions in the course of the talks 
first agreeing in july to back away from his no new taxes 
pledge and then just within the past few days abandoning his 
insistence on a lower capital gains tax rate 
did bush give up more than he gained i dont think were 
going to get into the hot rhetoric of what gain or loss there is in 
terms of political terms there will be a lot of time for that to 
take place in the days and weeks ahead white house chief of 
staff john sununu said sunday

new york p brazilian president fernando collor de mello told 
president bush on sunday that his country had provided nuclear 
technology to iraq in the past and now lamented the action a 
senior us official said 
collor described president saddam hussein as insane and said 
aggression cannot be permitted to succeed assistant secretary of 
state bernard aronson told reporters during a briefing on bushs 
meeting with the brazilian leader 
iraq is known to have relied on a number of foreign sources to 
try to develop a nuclear capability 
the bush administration believes iraq has begun production of 
chemical and biological weapons but it has not asserted that 
baghdad is turning out nuclear arms 
collor described the information brazil had given to iraq as 
potentially significant but did not provide further details 
the president of brazil lamented the fact that there had been 
some informal clandestine relations with iraq in the past that had 
involved the trading of some potentially significant information 
involving nuclear technology according to aronson 
it was not clear whether the trade was sanctioned by the 
government although the brazilian president said he renounced 
all such efforts 
he also said he supported legislation that would prevent former 
government officials from trading nuclear secrets after they return 
to private life 
collor said in one instance a former army officer involved in 
brazils nuclear program became involved in an iraqi project 
as for brazil itself aronson said collor promised the south 
american country would not launch any kind of nuclear project 
to demonstrate his resolve collor said he recently visited a 
secret army nuclear project and threw a shovelfull of lime down 
the mine shaft as a symbolic closing of this effort 
iraq and brazil are two of some 20 nations believed by american 
experts either to have the capability of producing nuclear weapons 
or to have actually begun to turn them out 
bush also met with president carlos andres of venezuela and 
thanked him for playing a leading role in persuading the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to increase oil 
production 
the aim is to make up for the boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
which is being boycotted in an effort to force saddam hussein to 
reverse his invasion of kuwait

sunday looking like a formidable contender for power but signs 
emerged that the persian gulf crisis was eroding labors lead over 
the conservative government in surveys 
three opinion polls published over the weekend indicated labors 
lead down to between five and nine points compared to about 15 
points a month ago and a record 24 percent last march 
the weeklong conference in the north england resort of blackpool 
was to endorse the socialist partys new moderate platform which 
ditches old tenets of the left from unilateral nuclear disarmament 
to promises to repeal unioncurbing laws 
the platform has helped push labor into its strongest position 
to regain power since prime minister margaret thatcher ousted the 
last labor government in 1979 
the government remains in deep economic trouble but the polls 
indicated mrs thatcher benefiting from strong public support for 
sending warplanes naval vessels and ground troops to the gulf and 
the general perception that she is good in a crisis 
there is the beginning of a gulf effect but it is indirect 
said political analyst peter kellner it is having an effect on 
the standing of the party leaders 
kellner was commenting on a national opinion poll sounding 
published saturday in a london newspaper the independent which 
indicated labor had 44 percent support and the conservatives 39 
percent 
the poll like most of those on the weekend indicated the 
centrist social and liberal democratic party had nearly doubled its 
support to 12 percent following its annual conference two weeks 
ago 
few of those surveyed cited the gulf as a major influence on how 
they would vote but large majorities supported the thatcher policy 
in the crisis 
since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait mrs thatcher has 
identified britain closely with the us military buildup in the 
persian gulf 
for the first time this year mrs thatchers personal standing 
overtook that of labor party leader neil kinnock in the national 
opinion poll sounding 
kinnock has upset the partys left wing by assiduously 
supporting the thatcher policy on the gulf 
party managers were confident of marginalizing the left wing 
headed by former energy secretary tony benn 
all pressure is on to maintain the unity we have so painfully 
achieved bryan gould labors campaign manager and environment 
spokesman said 
labors new 20000word policy document reflects how far right 
mrs thatcher has pushed the british political agenda 
the document incorporates many of her union curbs and drops 
previous promises to renationalize most of the stateowned 
enterprises she has sold off 
labor leaders say they envisage a top income tax rate of 50 
percent compared to 40 percent now and 83 percent when labor was 
last in power 
the tories meet next week 
this years party conferences could be the last before the next 
general election mrs thatchers fiveyear term ends in mid1992 
but governing parties often call elections a year early

which israel seized territory from moscows arab allies

posted a delegation in tel aviv that operated through the finnish 
embassy

relations have improved in part because moscow wants to play a 
role in middle east diplomacy

soviet union and israel shevardnadze said that was a complicated 
issue to be discussed further

a consulategeneral the highest level consulate in moscow and 
the soviet union would open a consulategeneral in tel aviv

the city offered to agree to expand the board 
of trustees of the university of the district of columbia to end a 
student protest that has kept the school closed since last week 
university officials said sunday 
negotiations continued between school officials and students who 
occupied two buildings including the universitys administrative 
offices 
trustees joseph webb and alonza evans said they had reached 
agreement with the students on 39 of their 44 demands 
the students were demanding extensive changes in the public 
institution including the resignation of 11 of the 15 trustees 
they claim the board has allowed the quality of the schools 
academic programs to decline 
the two trustees said they offered to support a city council 
bill to expand the board of trustees from 15 to 21 members 
there was no word from students on how they greeted that 
proposal but mark thompson a leader of the student protest said 
the occupation would not end until all demands are met 
trustees of udc which enrolls about 12000 students cannot be 
forced to resign they are nominated by the mayor and confirmed by 
council members 
two trustees have resigned voluntarily and others wont resign 
while the protest is going on because theyre just not going to 
resign under duress 
webb said the protesting students who number around 300 have 
made their point 
i wish they students would stop seeing the board as their 
enemy because i think the board indeed has been awakened he 
said 
among the incidents that incited the protest was the 
financiallystrapped universitys decision to spend 16 million so 
that it could acquire the controversial feminist artwork the 
dinner party 
that issue had not been resolved sunday webb and evans said 
trustees have said they would reopen the school monday

meeting sunday by pledging huge resources to battle the scourges of 
childhood poverty and with harsh words for those who commit 
atrocities in the name of the young 
the 72 kings presidents and prime ministers concluded the 
twoday world summit for children by adopting a declaration 
promising to fight the hunger disease and illiteracy affecting 
children 
the summit the largest gathering ever of international leaders 
was aimed at mobilizing governments to save up to 100 million 
children from death by disease and malnutrition in the 1990s 
the final declaration was signed by louis sullivan us 
secretary of health and human services earlier there had been 
concern the united states might not endorse the plan because it 
urges ratification of a pact that opposes the death penalty for 
those under 18 a practice in some us states 
officials at the summit estimated that achieving the 
declarations goals would cost billions of dollars but the accord 
gave no monetary figure and it relies on the goodwill of nations 
for contributions 
summit organizers said world bank president barber conable jr 
has pledged 500 million per year in a separate program for health 
and education for children more than 1 million children could be 
saved each year by the additional funds they said 
many of the worlds leaders gave at least brief speeches during 
the meeting which also provided a forum for bilateral discussions 
on a variety of themes not the least of which was the persian gulf 
crisis 
president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia said leaders from adolf 
hitler to iraqi president saddam hussein had committed evil for the 
supposed benefit of children 
thousands of times i have heard people defending their 
servitude to a hated regime by the argument that they were doing it 
only for their children havel told the assembly immorality 
was thus committed in the name of children and evil was served for 
their alleged good 
i saw hitler waving in a friendly way to the fanatic little 
girls of hitlerjugend hitler youth i saw mass murderer stalin 
kissing a child with the red communist youth organization scarf 
i saw iraqi president hussein patting children of his hostages 
whom as he now says he is ready to have shot said havel 
british prime minister margaret thatcher noted the sufferings of 
children in warravaged countries such as mozambique and lebanon 
these are evil things evil things done by wicked people 
mrs thatcher said they bring us hard up against the fundamental 
nature of human personality and character 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told the 
assembly there is no way we can reconcile humanitys remarkable 
progress with the continuance of the misery that counts children 
among its victims 
president bush said childrens can be saved when adults live up 
to our responsibilities but he said saving one child is a 
miracle 
we hold an unprecedent summit for those who will live in and 
lead a new world their voices still faint and unheard bush 
said we are gathered to speak for the children of the earth 
to defy statistics 
during the twoday summit the united nations estimates 2800 
children worldwide died of whooping cough 8000 more from measles 
4000 from tetanus 5500 from malaria 22000 from diarrhea and 
12000 from pneumonia all preventable ailments 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu noting that universal 
education was the foundation for japans economic success 
advocated extra pay and status for public school teachers around 
the world 
national development can take place only when all people have 
the opportunity to receive an education there should be no more 
argument as to which should come first economic development or 
education he said 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez noted the problems of 
homeless children child refugees and child laborers in latin 
america are intolerable consequences of the huge foreign debts 
of many countries in the region 
bush departed from the summit early in order to attend budget 
negotiations in washington he was scheduled to address the un 
general assembly on monday 
summit leaders were escorted to their seats in the 
emeraldcarpeted general assembly hall by children in national 
costume holding miniature flags of their countries large portraits 
of children from every continent adorned the walls a childrens 
chorus sang of peace 
bush was escorted by jostin lebo 14 of palisades nj who 
repairs bicycles for lessfortunate children 
us aides called him one of the thousand points of light 
sought by bush as an example of people helping others 
the final draft declaration the action plan for the summit 
commits nations to work toward signing the un convention on the 
rights of the child already ratified by more than 40 nations 
the us government has not signed the un rights convention 
conservatives take exception to the fact that it does not define a 
fetus as a child with rights and bans the death penalty for people 
under 18 
the 700word draft declaration was read to the gathering by 
children who then passed it around for signature 
afterward canadian prime minister brian mulroney said the 
real work starts now

in a major day in soviet foreign 
relations the kremlin established full diplomatic relations with 
south korea on sunday and announced it was upgrading its relations 
with israel after a 23year rupture 
the pact with the soviets was seen as a major victory for the 
seoul government and a devastating setback for communist north 
korea 
the soviet union has been a major ally and arms provider for 
north korea 
the decision by the soviets and israel to open consulates in 
each others country announced after a meeting between soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and israeli foreign minister 
david levy represented a major step in restoring relations severed 
after the 1967 middle east war israel seized territory from 
moscows arab allies during that conflict 
consular relations are a level below full diplomatic eelations 
soviet diplomats also were busy sunday working on a draft un 
resolution to authorize the use of military force against iraq if 
previous measures by the world body including a world economic 
embargo and an embargo on air traffic fail to force iraq to 
retreat from kuwait us officials said 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets and americans were putting their heads together on the 
issue and that other delegations also are drafting proposed 
resolutions all with the view of being ready to act against iraqi

agreement establishing ties they issued a joint communique and 
stood together in a un corridor smiling and answering questions

that a soviet trade and economic delegation will visit seoul next 
month to discuss broad economic cooperation 
shevardnadze called south korea an important factor for peace in 
the region and said we believe that establishing diplomatic 
relations between the soviet union and south korea will aid the 
cause of stability in asia and the pacific region 
south korea has long pushed for ties with moscow and the 
soviets are eager for enhanced trade and economic cooperation to 
help bolster a sinking economy 
sundays move was expected to give south korea more leverage in 
its bid to join the united nations as a full member separately from 
north korea 
shevardnadze and levy told reporters they intend to start 
meeting regularly and that the foreign ministries of the kremlin 
and the jewish state will be in regular contact shevardnadze said 
israel would open a consulategeneral the highest level consulate 
in moscow and the soviets would open a consulategeneral in tel 
aviv 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said in jerusalem that direct airline flights between the soviet 
union and israel will begin within a month 
the soviet news agency tass said levy and shevardnadze discussed 
air service but decided to continue talks later 
such flights could accelerate the exodus of soviet jews to 
israel which is already straining to accommodate more than 100000 
soviet emigres who arrived since last year

there is no open season on incumbents in the 
offyear elections five weeks away despite evidence of political 
cynicism signs of voter anger and talk of a backlash against 
officeholders 
when the votes are counted most of the establishment is likely 
to be right where it is with new leases on office the 
dissatisfaction that shows in public opinion surveys and in the 
popularity of limiting elective tenure has been translated into 
voter uprisings only against a handful of clearly identifiable 
targets 
that showed most clearly in massachusetts where the real target 
wasnt even running democratic primary election voters took out 
their anger at retiring gov michael s dukakis by turning to 
outsiders over candidates with any linked to his administration 
which is plagued by an economic slump and was forced to push 
through a sharp increase in state taxes 
tax increases and budget woes not incumbency alone are the 
common denominator for governors in trouble thats one of the 
problems plaguing campaigning republican governors in places like 
rhode island kansas maine and florida and it was one of the 
factors in the voluntary retirements of 10 governors who didnt run 
again 
underscoring a primary election record that shows voters are 
selective in punishing incumbents minnesota democrats rewarded 
one renominating gov rudy perpich who once had looked like a 
loser hes already served 10 years longer than any other governor 
in state history 
and in all of congress with 435 house seats and 34 in the 
senate at stake next month only one incumbent seeking a new term 
was turned down for renomination that sole loser was rep donald 
lukens of ohio a republican renounced by his own party after a sex 
scandal 
at this point the democrats think they can make significant 
gains in the competition for governors with 36 states at stake 
there are no signs of major change in the political lineup in 
congress although republicans still hope to beat the offyear odds 
and gain a seat or two in the senate looking to better position 
themselves for a bid at control in 1992 
in congress most of what will happen on nov 6 already is 
ordained both parties say there are only a handful of real 
contests for house seats democratic national chairman ronald h 
brown guesses the count of competitive districts at 20 of the 435 
others put it lower 
four senators seeking reelection two republicans and two 
democrats have no major party opponents there havent been that 
many uncontested senate elections in 34 years and nine more have 
only token opposition 
ironically at the same time there seems to be growing 
sentiment in favor of limiting the tenure of officeholders 
oklahoma voters decided by a twotoone margin to put a 12 year 
limit on service in their state legislature term limits will be on 
the general election ballot in california and colorado the latter 
measure applying to members of congress as well as state 
officeholders leaders of an effort to do that nationally with a 
constitutional amendment claim they are gaining support 
thats one way out of a situation in which incumbents usually 
win even though the voters who reelect them say they dont like 
the product 
a survey conducted for the times mirror center for the people 
and the press reflects the mood cynicism toward the political 
system in general is growing as the public in unprecedented numbers 
associates republicans with wealth and greed democrats with 
fecklessness and incompetence that survey reported saying the 
result is political gridlock 
it is gridlock that could be broken by a congressional shakeup 
in 1992 even if the voters dont force the issue 
congressional redistricting guarantees changes in the house and 
campaign finance rules will make retirement a lucrative option for 
dozens of veteran congressmen under the law they can keep 
leftover campaign funds for themselves only if they retire by the 
end of the next congress an option worth 100000 or more for 62 
house members

while big banks and governments fret over their 
13 trillion in lending to the third world one nonprofit group 
loaned 237 million dollars to latin americans last year and got 
virtually all of it back with interest 
seamstresses fruit vendors carpenters and thousands of other 
working poor who power half of all economic activity in latin 
america are beneficiaries of an innovative loan program developed 
by accion international 
working through affiliates in 12 latin american nations the 
massachusettsbased group provides small business loans to 
those so poor they either cannot qualify for bank loans or must 
resort to loan sharks 
we are a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing poverty 
through the creation of jobs and increasing income said gabriela 
romanow communications director at accion international in a 
telephone interview 
accion international was founded in 1961 as a privaesector 
initiative to stimulate community development in latin america a 
network of local accion affiliates in latin capitals screen 
borrowers and approve loans at market interest rates 
more than 40 nonprofit us groups large banks and private 
donors finance the loan program as does the us agency for 
international development 
we have quite a few corporate donors and we also get money 
from foundations and individuals as well said romanow 
accions affiliates had 45000 borrowers last year who took out 
loans averaging 227 romanow said the default rate was less than 2 
percent 
the reason borrowers put up sewing machines and work tools as 
collateral individuals often apply for loans at community meetings 
or in small groups so if you dont pay back everyone knows 
romanow said 
the success stories are many like that of furniture maker ramon 
uceta who used his loans to escape poverty in santo domingo the 
dominican republic 
uceta borrowed 20 from a friend to make lamps out of wicker 
and he made three and sold them for 8 each romanow said 
he heard about accions affiliate and went in to ask for a 
loan for his wicker business about three years later after 14 
loans this man who had a tiny shack in a really poor neighborhood 
was able to expand to 14 fulltime employees 
she added he obviously has been able to move from his little 
wooden shack where he had no running water or electricity 
the loans also worked for petrona lopez of la paz bolivia who 
would occasionally beg in the city streets but has now been able to 
open her stand selling the national staple potatoes 
she and four others took out loans totaling 646 
she now has her own stall in the market instead of selling for 
other women said romanow she has been able to buy herself new 
clothing and is able to periodically to eat chicken a luxury she 
wasnt able to previously afford 
other borrowers include tailors seamstresses cobblers broom 
makers carpenters mechanics every kind of smallscale business 
that people actually do because they cant find jobs in the 
mainstream economy so they start 
she noted that studies show such workers comprise 30 percent to 
70 percent of the labor force in developing countries

its going to be very painful for a lot of people said 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas predicting a tough fight for 
enough votes to get the agreement past congress the naysayers 
the nitpickers may have a field day 
theres certainly plenty of unpopular stuff to choose from 
taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel would more than double the 
current ninecent levy would increase by five cents a gallon on 
dec 1 and another five cents next july 1 in addition there would 
be a 2centpergallon tax on all petroleum products except home 
heating oil beginning jan 1 that means the federal motor fuel 
levy would top out at 21 cents a gallon 
the federal tax on cigarettes now 16 cents a pack would rise 
four cents a pack on jan 1 and another four cents in 1993 
medicare taxes and fees would increase while benefits go down 
middleincome taxpayers not just the elderly would pay for 
medicare currently the payroll tax of 145 percent stops after a 
taxpayers income hits 51300 the budget deal would keep workers 
and employers paying until a 73000 income cap 
state employees who currently dont pay the medicare tax or 
social security would be brought into the system 
meanwhile medicare patients would pay more of their doctor 
bills the annual deductible would double in two years from 75 to 
150 coverage for clinical testing would drop from full to 80 
percent and monthly premiums would rise from 2860 to about 34 
next year by 1995 they would rise to about 54 a month 
buyers of new cars boats jewelry and furs would pay a

boat owners also would be hit with a new coast guard fee a 25 
annual decal and the army corps of engineers would begin charging 
fees at recreational sites it oversees 
most individuals or families with in excess of 100000 in 
annual income would pay more income taxes with the government 
disallowing 3 percent of itemized deductions but medical expenses 
or investment interest would not be limited beyond what they 
already are 
taxes on beer wine and other alcoholic beverages would rise 
although the exact figures remained to be decided tax on a six 
pack of beer would go up 20 cents to 36 cents wine would cost 
about 33 cents more for a regularsize bottle the threecent 
federal tax on wine hasnt changed in nearly 40 years hardliquor

providers of medicare services would be forced to absorb a 
portion of rising costs equal to roughly 32 billion over the next 
five years

president bush and congressional leaders on 
sunday forged a 500billion fiveyear compromise package of tax 
increases and spending cuts spurring congress to quick action on a 
stopgap spending measure needed to avoid slashes in federal 
services monday 
the house approved the temporary financing bill just three hours 
after the budget agreement was described by president bush in a 
rose garden announcement and the senate quickly followed 
it is balanced it is fair and in my view it is what the 
united states of america needs at this point in its history bush 
said in announcing an agreement that concluded budget negotiations 
that began in may 
the package contained 134 billion in new tax revenues 
including new taxes on gasoline cigarettes alcohol and luxury 
items medicare costs for the elderly and disabled were increased 
defense spending was slashed as well 
on a 38241 vote the house passed what is called a continuing 
appropriations resolution to keep the government operating at full 
speed through next friday while lawmakers weight the proposed 
budget compromise 
the resolution which then passed the senate by voice vote also 
includes 2 billion in new appropriations for the desert shield 
operations in the persian gulf 
arrangements were being made to fly the legislation to bush in 
new york sunday evening but it was not clear whether he would sign 
the measure prior to a technical midnight expiration of the 
existing budget as a practical matter however the exact timing 
of his signature which was a certainty was not significant as 
long as it occurred within a day or so 
house speaker thomas foley dwash praised the compromise but 
agreed with senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine who 
said now comes the hard part in pushing it past special 
interest groups and through congress 
rep newt gingrich of georgia the no 2 house republican and a 
leader of the partys conservative wing left the white house 
before the rose garden announcement of the deal not yet ready to 
support the package were still looking at it he told 
reporters later im still thinking 
at the other end of the political spectrum rep charles rangel 
dny said he would oppose the package because it looks like a 
tax on people who are hurting the most and rep nick joe rahall 
dwva said i dont think it goes far enough in getting the 
wealthy to pay their fair share 
ron pollack executive of families usa a nonprofit group that 
advocates on behalf of the elderly poor said the negotiators have 
declared war on our grandparents and warned that those who back 
the plan shouldnt expect older americans to be pacifists on 
election day 
edwin rothschild head of citizen action a nonprofit national 
consumer organization complained that the gasoline tax is a 
regressive measure that will hit poor and middleincome people 
hardest with gasoline and heating oil and other energy prices 
going through the roof it is absolutely the wrong time for 
congress and the president to be sticking the cost of the sampl 
bailout and other crisis on the average citizen said rothschild 
the compromise would shear 40 billion off the deficit expected 
for the new fiscal year without action the 1991 shortfall was 
projected to hit 294 billion 73 billion higher than the previous 
federal record for red ink and almost triple the shortfall the 
administration said it anticipated in january 
white house budget director richard darman attributed the higher 
deficit projection to the deteriorating economy and growing 
projections of the costs of rescuing the savings and loan industry 
the agreement would waive the current deficit targets of the 
grammrudman law which would have required the new fiscal years 
budget gap to not exceed 74 billion 
with congressional leaders at his side bush said i do not 
welcome the tax increases which he opposed during his 1988 
election campaign but he said they were needed to help the 
countrys economy and he said he would join in a bipartisan effort 
to get the package enacted by oct 19 
i will do everything i can to generate support from the 
american people for this compromise he said 
the components of the final budget compromise was a delicate 
political balance between tax increases democrats sought and 
spending cuts republicans favored 
we all made compromises in the national interest said house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
republicans in congress will be reluctant to accept the tax 
increases while many democrats will look warily at domestic 
spending reductions with most programs held to increases matching 
the inflation rate for the next three years there also were broad 
reductions in projected future spending for social pension and 
agricultural programs 
the toughest cuts would affect the military 10 billion in the 
new year and up to 182 billion over five years 
among the tax measures was a gradual boost in gasoline taxes 
from its current 9 cents per gallon to 21 cents a 12cent boost 
that includes a twocent per gallon tax applied to all petroleum 
fuels except heating oil 
cigarette taxes now 16 cents a pack will go up 8 cents more by 
1993 the 3centperbottle wine tax will increase to 24 cents the 
16cent tax on a sixpack of beer will go to 36 cents and the 
1250 per gallon tax on hard liquor will grow by 120 
luxury items such as fancy cars and jewelry will have a new 10 
percent tax and taxpayers who earn more than 100000 annually 
either as individuals or couples will have their deductions 
reduced by 3 percent 
but the package has tax breaks too which republicans argued 
were needed to help the economy companies that explore for gas and 
oil conduct research or do business in depressed urban and rural 
areas will qualify for tax advantages 
the elderly and disabled who now pay 2860 per month for 
medicare coverage of doctors expenses would see that premium 
increase to about 3430 the 75 cap on doctors costs medicare 
recipients must pay each year will be boosted to 150 
overall half the savings in benefit programs 60 billion 
would come from medicare split evenly between recipients and 
providers such as doctors and hospitals 
in addition upper income taxpayers will pay more to support the 
medicare program the government now takes 145 percent from 
paychecks to finance medicare up to an annual limit of 51300 
that ceiling will be increased to 73000 an official said 
farm support programs would be cut 13 billion over five years 
changes in the way payments are made to civil service retirees and 
postal workers would save 12 billion 
overall bush said 134 billion of the savings would come from 
newtaxes and fees 182 billion from defense and domestic cuts and 
120 billion from reductions in benefit programs like medicare the 
rest would come from reduced debt payments 
this will be seen as sufficient pain i think foley said 
negotiators completed their work early sunday afternoon after 
bush returned briefly from a busy work day at the united nations in 
new york 
in one of the final battles bush abandoned his effort to win a 
reduction in the capital gains tax rate in the end the proposal 
never made it into the final package but neither did higher 
incometax rates on the wealthy that democrats had demanded in 
return 
the two sides also agreed to drop another idea that made 
democrats and republicans alike nervous exacting savings from the 
nations 33 million social security recipients proposals to 
increase taxes on social security benefits or to restrain the 
growth of those benefits both fell victim to both parties fears of 
angry and wellorganized elderly voters 
with no agreement federal spending would have automatically 
been slashed by 85 billion monday enough to force many of the 
governments 21 million civilian workers to face unpaid days off 
and the public to deal with curtailed services the furloughs would 
have included air traffic controllers workers who process social 
security checks and fbi agents
