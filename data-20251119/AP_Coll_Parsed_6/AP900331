matthew stuart who exposed his late brothers 
plot to kill his pregnant wife was called friday before a grand 
jury investigating the slaying 
stuart was seen leaving the office used by the grand jury but 
his attorney nancy gertner refused to say if he had testified 
the case drew widespread attention when it broke dramatically 
the night of oct 23 a frantic charles stuart called police on his 
car phone to say his pregnant wife carol had been shot by a 
robber 
police found the middleclass couple in their car in an inner 
city neighborhood near a hospital where they had attended a 
birthing class mrs stuart was fatally wounded and stuart himself 
had a serious gunshot wound the baby delivered prematurely died 
17 days later 
for days nobody doubted stuarts story that the family had been 
attacked by a black mugger 
matthew stuart provided a dramatic turnaround in the case jan 
3 when he told authorities his brother had arranged for him to be 
at the murder scene 
he also told investigators he helped dispose of a gun which 
turned out to be the murder weapon 
charles stuart committed suicide jan 4 after his brother 
implicated him in the crime 
yet matthew stuarts revelations also raised questions about his 
role in the plot he has insisted he had no prior knowledge that 
mrs stuart would be killed and he said he did not see her body in 
the couples car when charles stuart passed him the handbag that 
contained the gun 
since stuarts suicide a suffolk county grand jury has convened 
periodically to piece together details of the plot prosecutors 
have not said whether charges might be filed 
matthew stuart arrived at the suffolk county district attorneys 
office friday morning he was seen with his two sisters but 
gertner indicated they were only accompanying him to the 
courthouse both sisters already have appeared before the grand 
jury 
i cant tell you whats happening gertner said 
everything before the grand jury has been impounded all the 
motions that have been filed are impounded

monday morning could bring on a special case of 
the groggy blahs after the switch to daylight saving time this 
weekend but some quick action can help ease the problem a 
researcher says 
this is one weekend you shouldnt sleep in said dr charles 
czeisler director of the center for circadian and sleep disorders 
medicine at brigham and womens hospital in boston 
instead the trick is to accustom the body as fast as possible 
to the time change he said friday 
the shift which occurs with the loss of an hour at 2 am 
sunday delivers a onetwo punch to the body it usually robs an 
hour of sleep since most people have trouble falling asleep an 
hour earlier than their normal bedtimes and it forces the body to 
readjust its daily internal rhythms including one that affects 
alertness and performance czeisler said 
one study found that traffic accidents jump 10 percent in the 
week following the switch to daylight saving time he said 
sleep expert merrill mitler of the scripps clinic and research 
foundation in la jolla calif said the onehour change is 
generally tolerated well by the body and adjusted to within a day 
or so 
the body copes more easily with the return to standard time in 
the fall because turning the clock back an hour is less of a 
challenge 
here is czeislers prescription for making monday morning as 
painless as possible 
dont stay up late tonight 
get up at your normal time according to the clock on sunday 
after getting up sunday take a walk outdoors for a half hour 
to 45 minutes before breakfast the idea is to expose yourself to 
bright outdoor light that will help reset your bodys clock 
which is in your brain 
if you want to make up some sleep lost earlier in the week 
take a nap around 3 pm or 4 pm today and sunday 
dont eat any heavy meals late today or sunday because that 
will make it harder to fall asleep similarly avoid caffeine after 
6 pm

millions of cropeating leafchomping 
crickets that can grow as big as a small mouse have invaded rural 
nevada in the worst infestation of the insects since the 1930s 
agricultural officials said 
weve probably got 700000 acres of the state infested now 
theyre starting to hatch and the ground is just black with them in 
some places dick rowe deputy director of the plant industry 
division of the nevada agriculture department said friday 
right now theyre little devils but pretty soon if theyre 
not stopped theyre going to be big mothers 
rowe has counted about 100 mormon crickets per square foot in 
the worst infested areas compared with one or two in a normal year 
the insects got their name from a similar infestation reported 
in utah in the 1800s sea gulls from salt lake city reportedly flew 
over the infested land eating the crickets to save the 
mormonpopulated area from total destruction he said 
i dont know if its true or not he said but it takes a 
pretty good size bird to eat them when theyre mature most of them 
are about the size of your thumb and they got hard spurs on the 
back of their legs so they get stuck in the craw of birds and kill 
them 
the crickets which make chirping sounds spit brown juice and 
bite humans if disturbed eat everything in sight including each 
other rowe said 
unable to fly they march in bands across the land and strip 
crops clean eat leaves and bark off trees and gobble up any 
organic material 
common crops across the infested parts of nevada include 
alfalfa alfalfa seed potatoes meadow hay and small grain 
state and federal agriculture agencies are developing a plan for 
controlling the infestation in northeastern and northcentral 
nevada 
chemical spraying and baiting the area with poisoned food is 
being considered and a control plan is expected to be adopted next 
week according to rowe and george nash head of the federal animal 
and plant health inspection service plant disease and quarantine 
operation based in reno 
but nash estimated it would cost 15 per acre for control 
measures with farmers and ranchers paying half the cost on private 
lands and the government picking up the entire tab on public 
property 
rowe said three or four dry springs in a row and recent warm 
weather have been perfect for the crickets the crickets stop in 
their tracks when the temperature drops and starve if they dont 
continue their hungry march he said 
jeff knight also with the state agriculture department said 
the crickets lay eggs in the summer and fall that incubate during 
the winter and hatch in the spring the onegeneration insects 
normally live through september he said 
its frightening once they get larger and start moving 
knight said ive seen some the size of a house mouse about 2 
inches in body length and threequarters of an inch wide when they 
bite theyre big enough to break the skin

protecting the american flag and the rights of 
political dissenters could be hot election issues this fall in view 
of the supreme courts willingness to swiftly confront the 
flagburning controversy 
the justices announced friday they will decide by early summer 
whether congress violated freespeech rights when it passed a law 
last year making it a crime to burn the flag 
if the justices agree with two federal judges and strike down 
the statute president bush and republican leaders will push to 
amend the constitution and house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
says he will not stand in their way 
foley has said that within 30 days of a highcourt ruling 
invalidating the federal law the house would vote on a 
constitutional amendment 
such an amendment would say a ban on flag burning does not 
violate free speech it would require approval by twothirds of the 
members of the house and senate and then ratification by 38 state 
legislatures for inclusion in the constitution 
the supreme court on friday granted an administration request to 
put the flagburning issue on a fast track that will allow it to 
announce a decision by july in cases from the district of columbia 
and seattle federal judges struck down the law in both cases 
the justices said they will hear arguments in the cases may 14 
marking the first time in nine years that a hearing will be 
conducted that late in a court term the court heard arguments june 
24 1981 when it studied the legality of the agreement that ended 
the iran hostage crisis 
on only two other occasions in recent times has the court held 
such special sessions before allowing publication in 1971 of the 
pentagon papers on the war in vietnam and before ordering 
thenpresident nixon in 1974 to surrender watergatescandal tape 
recordings 
arthur kropp president of the civil liberties group people for 
the american way decried the courts timing 
depending on the outcome we can expect that last years 
favorite political football a constitutional amendment will be 
back to kick off a whole new generation of 30second attack ads 
kropp said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan hailed the court action 
flag burners have been having a field day at old glorys 
expense he said the courts decision to put this issue on a 
fast track is great news for the flag the american people and 
those of us in congress who want old glory to have the protection 
it deserves 
the justices voting 54 last june struck down a texas law 
barring desecration or destruction of the flag the court said 
burning the american flag as a form of political protest is 
protected by the constitutions freespeech guarantees 
the ruling touched off a political firestorm and led to 
enactment of the federal law which carries a maximum oneyear jail 
sentence 
the texas law barred flag desecration that seriously offends 
others but the federal law bans flag burning regardless of its 
impact on anyone democratic leaders in congress say that 
difference makes the federal law constitutional 
the justice department has urged the high court to uphold the 
federal law despite the departments misgivings and statements by 
bush that a constitutional amendment to protect the flag is 
preferable 
the president allowed the law to be enacted oct 28 without his 
signature saying he doubts it is constitutional 
david cole a lawyer representing protesters who burned flags 
said he was disappointed that the justices will decide the issue 
before the fall elections 
such speedy review is unfortunate given the importance of the 
issue he said 
the controversy echoes themes from the 1988 presidential 
campaign in which bush stressed patriotic values and attacked his 
democratic opponent gov michael dukakis of massachusetts for 
vetoing state legislation to require that public school teachers 
lead their classes in the pledge of allegiance

president bush says he doesnt expect soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev to reply to his confidental message on 
lithuania but just wanted to be sure the soviets understand our 
position on the rebellious republic 
bush said friday that he had sent the message to gorbachev on 
the crisis to be sure theres no disconnect because of 
misinformation 
our views on the question of selfdetermination are 
wellknown around the world but i do not want to risk 
misunderstanding by failing to communicate he told reporters 
during a picturetaking session at the white house 
later while playing golf at the marine corps base in nearby 
quantico va the president was asked if he had heard anything 
back from gorbachev what i said doesnt i dont think require 
any answer he replied 
however the soviet presidents latest views will no doubt be 
relayed to bush during foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes visit 
to washington next week 
bush said that his thursday night message to gorbachev given 
to the soviet embassy here which in turn relayed it to moscow 
was in keeping with his policy of trying to stay in close touch 
with world leaders 
i want to be sure the soviets understand our position and 
understand that were not trying to make things difficult for 
lithuania or the soviet union or anybody else he said 
the president would not say exactly what he told the soviet 
leader telling reporters if i told you what i told him it 
wouldnt be confidential 
on capitol hill senate republican leader bob dole rkan 
issued a strong warning to gorbachev that contrasted with the 
administrations lowkey diplomacy 
if the soviets use force against lithuanian citizens dole said 
the soviets will be in real trouble here no trade agreements 
no trade preferences and no more of the kind of relations the 
kremlin is desperately seeking from washington it would be a 
severe blow to ussoviet relations 
however secretary of state james a baker iii said the united 
states was continuing to call for a resolution of the dispute 
through dialogue and independence 
we support lithuanians in their desire to achieve 
selfdetermination the real issue is how do we best get there 
baker said 
the united states has never recognized the forced incorporation 
of lithuania or the other baltic states of estonia and latvia 
into the soviet union in 1940 
at the same time it has not extended formal diplomatic 
recognition to lithuania in the aftermath of lithuanias march 11 
declaration of independence which moscow considers illegal 
over the past week the administration has strongly warned 
against the use of soviet force to thwart lithuanian independence 
and issued appeals for restraint on both sides 
bushs message was his first written contact with gorbachev 
since tensions began escalating with lithuanias march 11 
declaration to secede from the soviet union 
i want to be sure that the soviets understand our position and 
understand that were not trying to make things difficult for 
lithuania or the soviet union or anybody else the president said 
a senior administration official meantime said gorbachev 
appears to be under considerable domestic pressure because of 
the lithuanian crisis 
it isnt in anybodys interest to have this thing blow up 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in a related development the pentagon said friday that gen 
carl vuono the army chief of staff has postponed a weeklong trip 
to the soviet union that was scheduled to begin next week 
it just was felt that it isnt a good time to go said 
spokeswoman maj kathy wood 
she said the fourstar general had been slated to leave saturday 
for helsinki finland and travel to moscow on monday visits to 
kiev and leningrad were also on the schedule

kentucky a state hardly typecast as a hotbed of school reform 
suddenly finds itself in the forefront of national educational 
change thrust into that unaccustomed role by a sweeping court 
order 
last june the state supreme court declared kentuckys system of 
public schooling inequitable and unconstitutional it ordered the 
legislature to come up with an entirely new system of school 
governance and finance 
on thursday the legislature passed a 900page bill aimed at 
smoothing out the inequities between rich and poor local school 
districts through a 126 billion package of state tax increases 
gov wallace wilkinson is expected to sign the measure perhaps 
today 
the result the state will establish a minimum spending level of 
2900 for each of kentuckys 570000 students under the current 
system spending varies from 1800 to 4200 a year per student 
depending on each districts wealth or poverty 
were going to do innovative things in kentucky for once 
said state rep greg stumbo the democratic majority floor leader 
were not going to be a follower any more were going to be a 
leader 
while undoubtedly important to kentuckians the school finance 
changes mandated by the bill are not what is most eyecatching to 
those concerned with national school reform kentucky after all 
is just one of 11 states where courts in recent years have ordered 
overhauls of inequitable school finance systems the other states 
new jersey kansas wisconsin california connecticut washington 
west virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
whats really radical is how kentuckys new system will change 
the states relationships with local districts and eventually 
perhaps those in other states as well 
other reform attempts started in the nation have only dealt 
with funding none have been as massive as kentuckys was and none 
have been as influential as kentuckys will be predicted david 
allen president of the the kentucky education association the 
states largest teacher group 
under the new system the state department of education would 
set broad goals that all local districts would have to fulfill 
those would include development of critical thinking skills the 
ability to apply concepts from math the sciences the arts 
humanities and social studies and ensuring that students become 
sufficient and responsible members of a family work group or 
community 
districts in turn would gain unprecedented control over 
curriculum and other daytoday operations and the state would 
require at least one school per district to adopt sitebased 
management those schools would form committees consisting of the 
principal and teacher and parent representatives empowered to make 
decisions on curriculum and other matters 
the legacy of this act will be how it changes local and state 
relationships said kent mcguire a school finance expert for the 
education commission of the states based in denver 
to ensure that local districts were meeting kentuckys education 
goals the state would manage a system of rewards including cash 
for improving schools and punishments for failing ones including 
shutting down bad schools and firing teachers 
the idea of giving schools and local districts more power to 
govern themselves as long as they meet stateset goals is very much 
in line with what leading reformers have been urging lately 
but kentuckys plan still leaves unsolved a great unanswered 
question educators everywhere are grappling with how to fairly 
measure student and school progress 
details are still being worked out but the bill would have the 
state measure school improvement using among other things 
attendance and dropout rates and student test scores 
some worry that kentucky could rely too heavily on standardized 
test scores for rewarding or punishing schools that they say 
would lead teachers to teach to the test 
it would be unfortunate if the system of state rewards and 
punishments were to turn solely on performance on standardized 
multiple choice examinations because that would in my opinion 
pervert the educational process said arthur wise of the rand 
corp in washington who has written extensively on school finance 
issues 
my own research reveals that when you turn the screws on 
teachers will do what is necessary to make sure that their children 
and therefore they look good said wise

paul newman testified friday he never 
considered giving stock in his food companies to julius gold 
because the delicatessen owner did not make any meaningful 
contributions to help launch the companies 
mr gold had not made a significant contribution in the past 
and there was no indication he would make a significant 
contribution in the future newman said at his trial in 
bridgeport superior court 
gold is suing newman and his charity food companies claiming he 
was promised 8 percent of the stock for his assistance in launching 
the firms eight years ago gold says he made introductions 
attended meetings and performed other services to help form salad 
king inc and newmans own inc 
newman says golds only contribution was selling some of the 
dressing in his deli when salad king was launched in 1982 and 
while the actor once considered giving some stock to four friends 
who helped the companies newman said he held on to the stock to 
assure the profits go to charity 
i was always concerned that somebody else could gain control 
of the enterprise and exploit it the academy awardwinning actor 
said 
newmans westportbased food companies make salad dressing 
spaghetti sauce popcorn and lemonade newman launched the venture 
in 1982 with friend and novelist ae hotchner as a lark to sell 
the dressing they had been making in newmans westport home 
since then the companies have made 28 million in profits all 
of which have gone to charity newman has also used the funds to 
found the hole in the wall gang camp a camp in ashford conn for 
children with lifethreatening diseases 
newmans testimony continued friday under crossexamination by 
golds attorney richard albrecht who has tried to show his client 
is the only person who contributed to the companies but never got 
anything for his efforts 
albrecht asked newman if he got power from donating company 
profits to charity 
i dont know if i get power i get satisfaction out of that 
newman said if youre talking about getting red china into the 
united nations i dont have that power 
there are different uses of power he said later under 
direct examination by his lawyer w patrick ryan if you are 
fortunate enough to have a company like this you can either take 
that money and stick it in your pocket or you can go out and give 
it to people who are less fortunate or with the camp to children 
with lifethreatening diseases who may not live past the age of 11 
or 12 
newmans testimony over thursday and friday lasted more than 
three hours the trial itself should wrap up sometime next week

with disclosure of past drug use a possible 
complication president bushs nominee to regulate the nations 
savings and loans faces a confirmation fight on the senate floor 
next week 
by an 1110 vote friday t timothy ryan jr barely won the 
endorsement of the senate banking committee to become director of 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
the drug issue did not arise in the committee meeting but hours 
later after an nbc news report the administration confirmed that 
the 44yearold attorney told fbi background investigators that he 
used marijuana and cocaine on a few occasions in the early 1970s 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said the administration 
knew of ryans admission and that the senate committee had voted 
in full knowledge of these same facts he said ryan still had 
the administrations confidence 
nbc said some senators were privately troubled by ryans past 
drug use although none raised the issue publicly 
two democrats joined the committees nine republicans in backing 
ryan ten democrats opposed him complaining he had no experience 
in banking 
sorting through the aftermath of the savings and loan collapse 
will be the single most demanding and difficult financial job in 
our country so obviously we want someone of a towering size and 
capacity to tackle that assignment said the panels chairman 
sen donald w riegle jr who opposed the nomination 
nevertheless riegle dmich said he hoped the full senate 
could act swiftly on the nomination perhaps on wednesday the day 
after senators are expected to complete a clean air bill 
the administration has been under pressure to appoint a thrift 
director since march 21 when a federal judge ruled the agency 
lacked constitutional authority to seize troubled institutions 
the us court of appeals has delayed the ruling until april 11 
and the administration wants a senateconfirmed thrift director in 
office before then 
ryan an attorney who specializes in pension and employee 
benefit law would replace m danny wall who resigned under fire 
for his handling of the collapse of lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine calif 
following the nbc report ryan issued a statement saying 
prior to my nomination i disclosed both on my fbi form and 
verbally to the white house treasury and the fbi that early in the 
1970s i smoked marijuana on a few occasions and tried cocaine once 
perhaps twice 
i regret this mistake i do not regret having voluntarily 
disclosed this information he said 
treasury secretary brady said in his own statement the 
incidents were limited and a long time ago we knew about this 
issue because the nominee voluntarily disclosed this information 
we believe mr ryan is well qualified and his nomination deserves 
the senates full support 
democrats said ryans inexperience in the sampl field would force 
him to rely on guidance from the treasury department rather than 
exercise independent judgment they complained he had no opinion on 
such basic issues as financial standards for sampls and whether the 
thrift industry has a future 
the administration countered by portraying ryan as an 
experienced manager and tough enforcer who as solicitor of the 
labor department from 1981 to 1983 supervised 600 attorneys and 
helped clean up corruption in the teamsters unions central states 
pension fund 
sen jake garn of utah the senior republican on the committee 
conceded that ryan lacked experience but argued that 
conflictofinterest rules and postemployment restrictions have 
grown so tight that the administration had a very difficult time 
finding a candidate with more relevant qualifications 
we may reach a point where mother teresa is the only person we 
can confirm to any position in the federal government garn said 
riegle had predicted thursday evening that his panel would 
reject ryan but several members said brady made impassioned pleas 
on the nominees behalf 
democratic sens terry sanford of north carolina and richard 
shelby of alabama ended up joining republicans in support of the 
nomination 
sanford told reporters ryan was a personal friend whom he knew 
through the american council of young political leaders 
shelby who said he was prepared to vote against ryan as late as 
thursday night said friday that he thought the full senate should 
have a chance to vote adding the job needs to be filled 
in addition to his labor department service ryan has extensive 
political experience he served in the presidential campaigns of 
richard nixon in 1972 gerald ford in 1976 and george bush in 1988 
he was a legal counsel to ronald reagans 1980 transition team

the bush administration firing a new salvo in 
a steppedup campaign to reduce americas huge trade deficit is 
accusing 35 nations of erecting unfair barriers that block sales of 
us exports 
a list released friday focused on countries running large trade 
surpluses with the united states led by japan whose 49 billion 
surplus accounted for nearly half of the 109 billion trade 
imbalance last year 
the japanese took up 19 pages in the 214page report with the 
alleged infractions running the gamut from prohibitions against the 
sale of american rice to barriers against usmade semiconductors 
other countries with a long list of alleged barriers were 
taiwan canada west germany south korea and china all have large 
trade surpluses with the united states 
barriers erected by smaller trading partners were targeted as 
well ranging from soybean taxes in argentina to restrictive 
agricultural quotas in yugoslavia 
the 1990 edition of the trade barriers report prepared by us 
trade representative carla hills is the first step in drawing up a 
hit list of priority countries the administration will target 
for intensive negotiations aimed at getting the offending barriers 
eliminated 
the administration by law is required to issue its priority 
list by april 30 
a year ago 34 nations were cited in the initial trade barriers 
report from that list three countries japan brazil and india 
ended up on the priority list as targets for possible retaliation 
while officials are hopeful that negotiations with japan and 
brazil will succeed in eliminating barriers talks so far with 
india have made no progress 
in the case of japan negotiators are working against a june 16 
deadline for opening markets to us exports of space satellites 
supercomputers and wood products 
negotiators announced a breakthrough a week ago in the 
supercomputer talks and worked through the day friday seeking 
agreement in the area of satellite sales 
however members of congress said even if japan does make 
progress in the areas targeted last year other japanese barriers 
should be cited this year 
until the long list of barriers that us business faces in 
japan is cut down substantially the united states must keep up the 
pressure on japan to open its market said sen max baucus 
dmont chairman of the senate trade subcommittee 
joshua bolten general counsel in the trade representatives 
office refused to speculate on what countries might be put on this 
years priority list however other officials said they expected 
the administration to again significantly pare down the number of 
countries picked for intensive negotiations 
the requirement for a target list of countries known as the 
super 301 provision was the most controversial and feared 
section of the 1988 omnibus trade act 
all of the countries named friday for their trade barriers had 
been included in last years initial assessment as well with the 
exception of israel 
israel was cited this year for among other things restrictive 
licensing practices used to keep american goods out of the country 
the countries included in the new report are argentina 
australia brazil canada chile china colombia egypt west 
germany finland france greece india indonesia israel italy 
japan malaysia mexico new zealand nigeria norway pakistan 
the philippines portugal south korea spain sweden switzerland 
taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom venezuela and 
yugoslavia 
two trading blocs were also cited the 12nation european 
community and the gulf cooperation council which includes saudi 
arabia and the united arab emirates 
in addition to the talks on specific barriers to trade the 
united states and japan are conducting separate negotiations to 
address economic shortcomings in both nations that contribute to 
the trade imbalance 
those talks known as the structural impediments initiative 
will resume in washington on monday 
the japanese are pushing for stronger efforts on the part of the 
united states to reduce its budget deficit and restrain consumer 
spending american negotiators want an end to various exclusionary 
business practices that favor japanese companies at the expense of 
foreign competitors

the kremlins help in repealing a 1975 united nations resolution 
that equates racism and zionism a state department official says 
several discussions that we have held with the soviets at the 
un in moscow and here in washington on the issue of zionism is 
racism unfortunately have failed to produce agreement for a 
concerted approach toward repealing the resolution john r

asked bolton to produce a list of those countries that voted for 
resolution 3379 and which also receive direct us aid

getting american money but youre not going to get any more unless 
you change your mind moynihan asked

former president carter said he is unsure whether 
he has done more in his recent humanitarian activities than he did 
while in the white house 
but he is sure of this i will never run for office again 
under any circumstances 
carter told the atlanta press club on friday that as a private 
citizen he can do things he could not do as president such as 
meeting with revolutionary leaders as representative of the united 
states he would be barred from talking to forces trying to oust an 
established government 
he cited the panama canal treaties the camp david accord 
between israel and egypt and normalization of relations with china 
as among his top presidential achievements 
but he also noted his efforts through the carter center to rid 
africa of the debilitating guinea worm which afflicts 10 million 
people a year 
if in 1996 we find that where there were 10 million cases of 
guinea worm there are none i would say the guinea worm is more 
important he said

zsa zsa gabor thinks she has completed her 
sentence of 120 community service hours for slapping a cop but a 
judge is skeptical 
municipal judge charles rubin on friday ordered the director of 
a homeless shelter for women to produce documents describing in 
full all of ms gabors services 
the judges letter was prompted by one from vera davis 
executive director of the low income elderly unitedcommunity 
assistance program davis stated gabor had fully completed her 
service at the shelter 
but gabor in a newspaper report published monday said she had 
put in only 50 hours at the shelter and would complete the 
remainder by sponsoring a june 8 benefit auction for the center 
not good enough said deputy district attorney elden fox 
im going to make her work at the shelter for 120 hours fox 
said the implication to me is that judge rubin wanted that 
too 
if davis cannot provide the documentation fox said she may 
have to testify under oath 
gabors mouthy outbursts during her copslapping trial last year 
prompted stern recriminations from the judge she was convicted on 
three criminal counts for her runin with beverly hills policeman

a committee created by congress is ending its 
15month study of the federal courts by recommending major 
reductions in the workloads of federal judges 
in a 203page report to be sent monday to president bush 
congress and chief justice william h rehnquist the panel included 
these recommendations 
shift more drug cases from federal to state courts and give 
state court systems the money needed to cope with the increased 
number of prosecutions resulting from the shift 
transfer many of the disputes over social security benefits 
from the courts to administrative procedures and encourage similar 
outofcourt resolution of jobbias claims 
create an office of judicial impact assessment within the 
federal court system to advise congress about proposed laws and to 
point out drafting defects that might breed unnecessary 
litigation 
repeal mandatory minimum sentencing provisions now in effect 
for numerous federal crimes and have the us sentencing 
commission redraft guidelines that would not be binding on federal 
judges 
the committee said more federal judges are needed but not above 
the number of new judgeships already requested it also said that 
the federal court workload is at a much more critical level in 
appellate rather than trial courts 
the report said congress and the president should fill judicial 
vacancies and approve requested additions quickly but it added 
the committee does not regard additional judgeships as a 
longterm solution 
discussing the judicial fallout from the bush administrations 
war on drugs the report said minor drug cases find their way 
into federal court because congress has provided funds for federal 
and not for state prosecutions 
some of the funds that congress has approved for drug 
enforcement should be used to provide assistance for drug 
enforcement at the critical state and local level it added 
the committee opposed creation of a proposed national appeals 
court that would serve as a buffer between the 12 regional federal 
appeals courts and the supreme court 
but the report recommended that congress authorize an unusual 
fiveyear experiment as an alternative it would allow the supreme 
court to resolve conflicting rulings among two federal appeals 
courts by ordering a third appeals court to tackle the same issue 
and render a nationally binding decision 
the third courts ruling would be final unless the supreme court 
granted a rehearing 
the committees report is a response to what committee members 
called mounting public and professional concern with the federal 
courts congestion delay expense and expansion 
the 15member committee was led by joseph f weis jr a federal 
appeals court judge from pittsburgh it included other judges 
lawyers and law professors

estonia has formally declared its intention of 
seeking independence from the soviet union but it took a more 
conciliatory approach than lithuania and set no timetable for the 
break with moscow 
soviet annexation of independent estonia in 1940 did not end 
the existence of the estonian republic estonian lawmakers said 
friday in a resolution the estonian republic is still occupied 
today 
the vote in estonias supreme soviet was 750 with three 
abstentions 
the move put estonia on the path toward a possible confrontation 
with the kremlin but not as directly as lithuania the lithuanians 
declared outright independence on march 11 and they have been 
locked in a tense standoff with the kremlin since 
estonian legislators set no independence date they agreed to 
establish full independence only at the end of an undefined 
transition period 
during the transition estonia would work out its own future 
government structure and settle differences with moscow 
the three baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia have 
been under moscows control since they were crushed by soviet 
forces 50 years ago on the eve of world war ii 
like lithuania and latvia estonia gained independence from the 
ruins of the russian empire at the end of world war i but it was 
annexed by josef stalin in 1940 
the official soviet news agency tass said estonia proclaimed 
the beginning of restoration of the estonian republic announcing a 
transitional period which will be completed with the formation of 
the estonian republics constitutional agencies of state power 
independent deputy mart laar said the session was broadcast live 
on television and radio he said streets of the capital tallinn 
were nearly deserted because everyone was indoors following the 
proceedings 
laar said in a telephone interview that deputies in the 
105member legislature who represent mainly russianspeaking 
districts boycotted the vote but did not walk out of the hall 
he did not know how many deputies refrained from voting but 
about a quarter of the supreme soviet is made up of russians 
ukrainians and other nonestonians who generally oppose 
independence 
the legislature was elected march 18 in competitive voting that 
gave proindependence forces a strong hand in this small republic 
of 16 million people on the gulf of finland 
estonias communist party declared its independence from the 
main soviet communist party on sunday it said the split would be 
formalized in october 
laar said many deputies support declaring independence from 
moscow at about the same time he said the length of the transition 
period will be set and new leaders for the republic will be elected 
when the supreme soviet resumes work monday 
estonia initially took the lead in the baltic autonomy drive by 
declaring its right to veto soviet laws in november 1988 since 
then however it has been overtaken by lithuanias more radical 
approach 
estonian activists say they want to organize estonias economic 
system and government before independence they also say they must 
move slower than lithuania because they do not have such a large 
ethnic majority in estonia 
lithuanians make up 80 percent of their republic but only 60 
percent of estonias people are ethnic estonians 
latvia wedged between estonia and lithuania is only about 50 
percent ethnic latvian it is moving more slowly than its two 
neighbors

history and the passage of more than 40 
years have finally left jeno szebedinzsky late in his life a 
winner 
since the late 1940s szebedinszky has been an exile settling 
into an adopted country while stubbornly carrying a torch for his 
native hungary 
during all those years first in pittsburgh and recently in 
indiana szebedinszky published a small hungarian language 
newspaper that struggled to preserve hungarian culture among his 
fellow emigrants and battle the authoritarian regime that ruled his 
homeland 
i love america i want to be and maybe i am a good 
american he said in the basement where he punches the text of 
his eightpage paper into a video display terminal 
but my home my mother home is hungary that lives in our 
souls 
the sudden collapse of authoritarian regimes across eastern 
europe surprised szebedinszky as much as anyone now with the iron 
curtain corroded by acid anger of citizens demanding political and 
economic reform szebedinszky feels vindicated in his loyalty 
through the early 1950s he dreamed of returning to hungary to 
publish his newspaper the revolt of 1956 brought a few summer days 
of promise before soviet tanks in the streets of budapest crushed 
the uprising his hopes of an early end to exile were dashed 
but his vigor and determination as a publisher were not he 
proudly tells of wearing out three linotype machines publishing in 
pittsburgh being part of an energetic hungarianlanguage press 
that included some 50 newspapers across the country many published 
daily 
we were working against the communists he said 
the work has not rewarded his finances the papers circulation 
never large has slipped to about 2000 readers who pay 85 cents 
per copy an issue may carry less than a half page of paid 
advertising 
i am a very bad businessman he admitted 
and he finds himself among a shrinking corps of hungarian 
stalwarts who have resisted the profits of assimilation into 
american culture although he still speaks of returning to hungary 
he acknowledged that many others who once lived as exiles have no 
such interest they live now wholly as americans with family and 
fortunes firmly rooted in land no longer so new 
after the death of his wife amalia two years ago szebedinszky 
gave up his pittsburgh home and moved to south bend where his son 
janos works as an executive for a book publishing firm 
ive got nothing anymore he said without a hint of 
selfpity just this he said waving at his small publishing 
setup and this one he said glancing at janos 
my job is not hard szebedinszky said i never work i 
enjoy doing it

a jury will begin deliberating next week 
whether john poindexter did his best to give congress the facts in 
the irancontra affair or engaged in what the prosecution called 
a rampage of destruction to cover up the scandal 
in closing arguments friday that followed three weeks of 
testimony prosecutor dan webb ridiculed the defense case and 
criticized former president reagans bias in favor of his onetime 
national security adviser 
poindexter destroyed a presidential document because it would 
have exposed his alleged lies to congress said webb in november 
1986 he said the document was the one piece of paper that puts 
the lie to reagans assertion then that there had been no trade 
of weapons to iran for american hostages in lebanon 
you dont lie to the american public webb said of reagans 
speech 
the presidential document ratified cia assistance to a nov 25 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran poindexter destroyed it 
hours after telling congress the president hadnt approved the 
shipment 
but defense attorney richard beckler said the document known as 
a finding was incomplete and incorrect the only one of those 
findings that counted was a later one that spelled out us 
efforts to make contact with moderate political elements in iran 
he said 
beckler said poindexter was the first reagan administration 
official to disclose the missile shipment to congress and did his 
everloving best to give as much information as he could tell to 
lawmakers 
this was not some grimy little conspiracy involving 
poindexter the lawyer insisted poindexter was working for the 
president of the united states 
webb said poindexter tore up the finding on nov 21 1986 amid 
a rampage of destruction carried out by his aide oliver north 
and norths secretary fawn hall poindexters subordinates 
shredded computer messages and altered documents 
the rampage was carried out by north and hall at the 
direction of former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
but not admiral poindexter who didnt know about it said 
beckler the alterations hid norths military assistance to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua 
a day or so before he resigned webb said poindexter destroyed 
5000 messages in his computer after north called him and said 
attorney general edwin meese iii had confronted him north had 
admitted the diversion to meese and congress was inquiring about 
the iran initiative 
beckler said it was routine practice for departing employees of 
the national security council to delete computer messages 
webb said the evidence the defense put on was largely 
irrelevant with reagan who gave a videotaped deposition played 
at the trial being made to recite his contacts with foreign 
leaders to help the contras 
the prosecutor said the former president was biased in favor of 
poindexter and said he became a little bit angry when he saw 
reagan wink at his exnational security adviser on the tape 
i would have expected more of a former president said webb 
webb said north had been generally instructed by poindexter to 
lie to the house intelligence committee by denying he was giving 
military advice to the contras north testified that poindexter 
sent him to the meeting but said it was his own decision to lie 
north deceived he obstructed he did everything he could to 
make certain congress didnt find out what he was doing said 
webb poindexter sent north a note five days later saying well 
done 
he is congratulating him thanking him for having lied to 
congress said the prosecutor 
he cant send north to congress to lie congratulate him when 
he gets done lying and escape legal responsibility for what he has 
done webb said of poindexter 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy and two counts each of 
obstructing congress and making false statements to congress 
the jury will receive the case after hearing instructions monday 
from us district judge harold greene

the state department is not ruling out the 
possibility that libyan leader moammar gadhafi may have set fire to 
a chemical weapons plant two weeks ago according to published 
reports 
i cant rule that out spokesman richard boucher said friday 
he said its possible libya still may be able to produce 
chemical weapons at the plant 60 miles southwest of tripoli 
important uncertainties remain regarding both the cause and 
extent of the damage at rabta said boucher therefore no 
definitive conclusions have been reached 
us officials have received intelligence reports indicating 
that the fire might have been set by gadhafis agents to make it 
appear that their chemical weapons program had been put out of 
action the new york times and the washington post reported in 
todays editions 
one report said truckloads of tires were brought to the plant 
and ignited on gadhafis orders the newspapers reported 
boucher called for the dismantling of rabta without regard to 
how that was achieved 
defense secretary dick cheney at a meeting of the association 
of american publishers here friday also said the plant was still 
there 
it still has presumably some residual capabilities how much 
it was damaged obviously we dont know yet thats something that 
well look at very carefully cheney said during a 
questionandanswer session 
before the march 14 fire us intelligence analysts had 
concluded the plant was producing poison gas and nerve gas agents 
as well as canisters to carry the deadly weapons to their targets 
the day after the blaze the white house and state department 
said the plant appeared to be out of operation 
we dont know the origins of the fire said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater we dont know if it was 
sabotage somebody could have knocked over a kerosene lamp or 
something 
gadhafi blamed the fire on west germany while the libyan news 
agency reporting two deaths in the blaze suggested a usisraeli 
plot 
us officials declined to say whether the new assessment 
reflected a closer look at the facility presumably by satellites 
or whether libya with or without outside assistance was able to 
manage some reconstruction 
the us government is reviewing all available evidence 
boucher said important uncertainties remain regarding both the 
cause and the extent of damage at rabta therefore no definitive 
conclusions have been reached 
he then added dramatically the possibility remains that libya 
can still produce chemical warfare agents 
about two dozen countries including the united states and the 
soviet union are known to have the capability to produce chemical 
weapons none causes more concern to the us government than libya 
gadhafi has been accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks against 
us and israeli citizens and facilities in retaliation the 
united states bombed tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 
however president bush and other us officials denied any 
involvement in the rabta fire which occurred a week after the 
white house called for vigorous efforts to halt operations at 
the plant 
cia director william webster once described the plant as the 
worlds largest chemical weapons factory gadhafi however has 
contended it produced pharmaceuticals

the pentagon says it is dropping its export 
license review process for certain items deemed to have minimal 
security risk that may be headed to the soviet union or eastern 
europe 
the reviews involve certain types of computers medical 
equipment such as cat scanners and equipment for cancer treatments 
and other industrial items such as machine tools and 
telecommunications equipment the defense department said in a 
statement friday 
the pentagon said it was delegating its review authority in 
these areas to the commerce department 
the change in procedure will not remove requirements for export 
licenses for the items but shifts the review process to the 
commerce department said an official familiar with the decision 
that means the commerce department may issue the export licences 
without referring the export application to the defense department 
for review the pentagon has suggested that the change be 
implemented immediately the statement said 
the reviews are required for export items considered 
dualuse meaning they could have both civilian and military 
applications 
the move is based on our experience with items that we have 
approved after going through the review process said the 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity it eliminates 
bureaucracy 
the pentagon will continue to review licenses for items 
considered to have higher security applications such as 
supercomputers 
it will no longer review the export license requests for such 
computers as the ibm 3031 4331 and 4341 series considered on the 
low end of mainframe computer systems 
however export licenses for such computers as ibms 4381 and 
4370 series will continue to be reviewed by the pentagon because 
they are on the higher end of midrange computers officials said 
the authorization has also been shifted to commerce for review 
of licenses for the temporary export of products that might be 
shown at exhibits and trade shows in eastern europe or the soviet 
union the statement said 
the change is intended to assist our exporting community and 
improve the competitive position of us industry in international 
trade by expediting the licensing process in areas that involve 
minimal security risk the statement said

about 120 people were fasting at the institute of medical 
radiology the institute is in the ukrainian city of kharkov 400 
miles southwest of moscow

group calling itself chernobyl plan to picket the republics 
nuclear power stations on the fourth anniversary of the disaster 
according to the interfax news agency an affiliate of radio moscow 
on april 26 1986 a fire and explosion at the chernobyl plant 
near kiev in the ukraine killed at least 31 people radioactive 
contamination affected millions of acres of land nearly 100000 
people were relocated because of the poisoned environment 
the weekly moscow news reported in november the death toll had 
reached more than 250 including victims who were working at the 
plant during the disaster and those who helped in the cleanup 
a spokesman for the government agency responsible for the 
cleanup confirmed the figure of 250 dead but said only the 
longrecognized official death toll of 31 could be attributed 
directly to the accident 
in kiev the presidium of the ukraine supreme soviet has 
designated april 26 chernobyl tragedy day tass said friday 
the legislative body earlier this month voted to phase the station 
out of operation over the coming years

the congress of peoples deputies at its inaugural session in may 
1989 then were sent to the soviet and ukrainian governments trade 
unions and health ministries tass said 
a resolution adopted by the regional trade unions council said 
radiation victims should be given priority medical treatment as 
well as the necessary drugs and food the news agency said 
however organizations in charge of implementing the 
resolution have ignored the legitimate interests of chernobyl 
victims despite receiving a notice of a possible hunger strike as 
early as february tass said 
it quoted a strike committee member as saying the fast will 
continue until the protesters receive guarantees from the soviet 
leadership or until the arrival of a special government 
commission 
tass gave no additional details of the conditions in which the 
patients were kept except to cite the shortages of hospital beds 
and drugs both problems are common in the soviet union where 
topquality health care is hard to find but the government had 
pledged that chernobyl victims would be given priority 
the supreme soviet legislature in moscow is due to discuss 
benefits for chernobyl victims april 22 tass said it quoted trud 
as urging the supreme soviet to move the discussion up because of 
the hunger strike

a truck carrying 2900 gallons of diesel fuel over 
siberias frozen lake baikal has sunk through a fissure in the ice 
and may pollute the lake that holds onefifth of the worlds fresh 
water tass reports 
leakage from the tanks which came to rest 150 feet below the 
surface and 350 feet from shore has been limited the official 
soviet news agency said friday 
the tanks are reliably plugged and the small amount of 
fuel that has surfaced is being localized and pumped to the 
shore the agency said 
but larisa urbakhanova head of the irkutsk regional nature 
conservancy district told tass that the consequences of such a 
bomb are very unpredictable in baikal 
the lake 2500 miles east of moscow and north of the mongolian 
border is 390 miles long 50 miles across at its widest and more 
than 4800 feet deep at points scientists estimate it holds 
onefifth of the worlds supply of fresh water 
tass said the fuel truck moving over baikal was part of a convoy 
carrying fuel supplies to a settlement on the lakes edge but did 
not say exactly where it sank 
baikals ice is thick enough in winter to drive on but drivers 
must watch for cracks tass said truck drivers who treated the 
lake as they would a normal highway were to blame for the accident 
tass said 
the two lead trucks in the conovy managed to maneuver their 
vehicles around the cracks but the third plunged through the ice 
the driver escaped it said 
efforts to save baikal from pollution have been one of the 
starting points of the soviet ecology movement that has sprung up 
under president mikhail s gorbachev 
there is little heavy industry near the lake located far from 
the countrys industrial center paper factories situated nearby 
have been told to stop dumping wastes into baikal

idahos antiabortion governor says he 
vetoed legislation that would have become the most restrictive 
abortion law in the nation because it was flawed by outside forces 
meddling in state affairs 
we idahoans are a fiercely independent group who will call it 
as we see it gov cecil andrus said i have done that 
to outofstate opponents of his friday veto he said i would 
respectfully suggest you return to your own states and try and do 
it there 
in the past three weeks more than 21000 telephone calls 
letters and petitions have flowed into the governors office calls 
from out of state outnumbered those from idaho residents by 3to1 
the lobbying peaked thursday at more than 4100 calls with a 
ratio of 2to1 in favor of a veto 
antiabortion groups wanted to use the idaho measure to 
challenge the us supreme courts commitment to legalized abortion 
as spelled out in the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
the democratic governor who is running for a record fourth 
term said he was not fazed by threats from abortion rights 
advocates of a boycott of idaho potatoes the states no 1 cash 
crop if the bill became law 
i believe and i am confident the people of idaho believe 
that we can make our own judgments on this terribly important issue 
without outside pressure and outside influence or threats andrus 
said 
the veto effectively killed the bill 
the legislature adjourned its regular session before andrus 
announced the veto and can only be called back by the governor 
bill proponents conceded they lacked enough votes to gain a 
twothirds majority needed to override the veto anyway 
andrus said the legislation failed to offer a woman and her 
family flexibility in the case of rape and incest 
the bill is drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and 
without compassion further harm an idaho woman who may find herself 
in the horrible unthinkable position of confronting a pregnancy 
that resulted from rape or incest andrus said 
he said legal scholars from both political parties found the 
bill did not have the remotest chance of surviving a court 
challenge that could cost the state as much 15 million 
the legislation called for outlawing abortion except in cases of 
nonstatutory rape reported within seven days incest if the victim 
is under 18 severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or 
physical health of the woman it was similar to bills rejected by 
other states as too restrictive 
when all the rhetoric and emotion is set aside and the issues 
are examined in the cold glare of hard cases these restrictions 
fail the test of reasonableness and compassion andrus said 
his decision was quickly cheered by abortion rights advocates 
who had feared his longstanding opposition to abortion except in 
cases of rape incest and to save the life of the women would sway 
him to sign the bill 
kate michelman president of the national abortion rights action 
league said andrus took a bold step in view of his antiabortion 
philosophy 
she noted the move might have a political cost for him adding 
but we will be there to support him and the people of idaho 
will support him because a majority of the people of idaho 
disagreed with what the legislature did 
the national right to life committee which was instrumental in 
drafting the measure had harsh words for andrus 
the organizations president john willke said andrus had bowed 
to the hollow threats and pressure tactics of proabortion 
extremists 
willke called it ridiculous for andrus to continue to claim he 
is prolife when he has vetoed a bill that would have saved 
thousands of lives 
andrus acknowledged he faced political fallout from his veto 
especially since the frontrunner for the republican gubernatorial 
nomination state sen rachel gilbert of boise voted for the bill 
two of the bills chief architects rep gary montgomery and 
sen roger madsen both republicans said they would refine the 
bill and reintroduce it in the 1991 session 
there are a tremendous amount of people in idaho who are 
prolife madsen said

an eastern airlines flight engineer 
fired this month after being charged with buying crack tested 
positive for cocaine use in july but kept flying for the 
strikeplagued airline a company spokeswoman confirmed 
the spokeswoman said the test results apparently went unnoticed 
because of a clerical error 
eastern fired dain schneemilch 36 of key largo fla on march 
20 after he was charged with buying 20 worth of crack from a local 
police officer posing as a drug dealer in february 
in a termination letter the chief pilot of the airlines miami 
crew base michael vaughan wrote schneemilch that his eastern drug 
test last july was positive for cocaine use the fort worth 
startelegram reported today 
that test had been administered after schneemilch decided to 
cross the picket line in the air line pilots association strike 
against eastern the newspaper reported the strike began in march 
1989 
schneemilch continued to fly as a flight engineer on boeing 727s 
until midseptember the startelegram reported 
on sept 18 schneemilch was promoted to first officer or 
copilot on the same aircraft he was in ground school training 
for his new assignment at the time of his arrest in february 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said 
when he tested positive for cocaine use in july it should 
have been noticed by someone on our staff but it wasnt ms 
ceremsak said it was a clerical error a mistake 
the carrier hired about 1000 pilots between april and august of 
last year ms ceremsak said as eastern tried to rebuild itself 
from the pilots and mechanics strike also about 700 striking 
pilots crossed the picket lines and returned to work during that 
time 
we believe thats probably why it happened at that time ms 
ceremsak said thats not meant as an excuse just an 
explanation 
she said schneemilch never served as a first officer on any 
eastern flight she also said schneemilch had passed a drug test 
administered as part of his annual physical exam only four days 
before the arrest 
since schneemilchs arrest eastern has reviewed the drug tests 
of all of the pilots it hired last summer and found no other 
positive results were overlooked ms ceremsak said 
the drug test he took last summer was not then required by the 
federal aviation administration she said random drug tests of 
airline employees began in december 
schneemilch has pleaded innocent to the crackbuying charge the 
case is pending in florida state court his attorney timothy 
thomes of key largo told the startelegram while matters are 
pending we would have no comment

the united states today picked up an unexpected 
ally a japanese supermarket chain in its fight against a law 
that hinders large more efficient stores from competing with 
momandpop outlets 
life stores co today said it filed a 63 million suit against 
the government claiming restrictive government requirements have 
held up approval of one new supermarket for nine years 
our experience is just the tip of the iceberg there are many 
other similar stores who have been facing the same problem 
toshiaki namiki a company spokesman 
at issue is the largescale retail store law a prime target of 
us trade pressure under the law local shopkeepers many fearful 
of the competition that a larger and likely lowerpriced 
supermarket or department store would bring often can stop a 
competitor from moving into their area 
in a news release the chains chairman nobutsugu shimizu said 
it was a shame to the country and its people to maintain such a 
law 
retailers in shiki city 15 miles north of tokyo are against 
the disputed supermarket because they fear their businesses will be 
damaged said eiten sato a spokesman for the shiki chamber of 
commerce 
under the law the ministry of international trade and industry 
can require large retailers to obtain local approval if their store 
is likely to negatively affect local retailers without approval 
large retailers cannot open new outlets 
the store law is a focal point in usjapanese trade talks 
which are to resume monday in washington the united states says 
the law gives undue influence to japanese manufacturers and 
prevents imported products from reaching store shelves 
in contrast japanese retailers such as mitsukoshi and tokyu 
department stores and yaohan supermarkets have already opened 
stores in the united states 
in a test of trade barriers the government agreed tuesday to 
consider a request by us toy retailer toys r us inc to open a 
53000squarefoot discount store in the country 
us officials says the loosening of japans market could ease a 
us trade deficit with japan that reached 49 billion last year 
however the trade and industry minister kabun muto said 
earlier this week that he has no intention of scrapping the law 
life stores an osakabased grocery store chain with 70 branches 
nationwide is also requesting the immediate ban of the law store 
chairman shimizu said he might drop the suit if the government 
agrees to scrap the law in the trade talks with us officials 
he said life stores action came shortly before the 
usjapanese meeting because we thought its now or never 
victims of the largescale store law are none other than the 
consumers shimizu said

greyhound lines inc cited continuing violence 
when it canceled a trip to the bargaining table next week in the 
monthlong strike by union bus drivers 
a union leader accused the company of using smear tactics 
against the strikers by blaming them for the violence the company 
says there have been 28 shooting attacks on buses 70 bomb threats 
against buses or terminals and more than 100 other incidents since 
the strike started 
the two sides had agreed to meet monday with federal mediators 
in tucson ariz but the company called off the talks friday when 
it reported three more shootings and a bomb threat 
p anthony lannie greyhounds executive vice president said 
the company would agree to meet april 9 if there is no other 
violence in the meantime 
in a letter to edward m strait president of the amalgamated 
council of greyhound local unions lannie said we cannot resume 
negotiations while the violence continues 
strait said the union has repeatedly condemned violence and 
should not be blamed by greyhound 
clearly this is a part of a smear campaign against the union 
and the greyhound employees we represent strait said 
the union which represents 6300 drivers and about 3000 office 
and maintenance workers walked out march 2 in a disagreement over 
wages and job security 
the latest shooting occurred friday night when a bus was hit 
between pittsburgh and harrisburg pa another bus was fired on 
friday near tulsa okla no one was injured in the incidents 
company officials said 
on thursday a baggage handler in kansas city mo discovered 
three bullet holes in a bus that had traveled from minneapolis 
said company spokesman george gravley there were no injuries he 
said 
also friday there was a bomb threat at the chicago terminal as 
in past threats no bomb was found the company said 
strait said friday there also have been 60 incidents of 
violence perpetrated by unsafe and illtrained replacement 
drivers against people on the picket lines 
elsewhere friday prolabor rallies were held in about 20 cities 
in a show of solidarity with the greyhound drivers 
greyhound has been operating on a reduced schedule since the 
strike began using permanent replacements and crossovers the 
company plans to expand service sunday aiming for 541 percent of 
prestrike miles covered

south koreas largest opposition party 
today began a drive to collect 10 million signatures aiming at 
forcing national elections to repudiate the newly bolstered 
governing party 
in january president roh taewoos conservative party merged 
with two moderate opposition groups giving rohs governing group 
an overwhelming parliamentary majority 
the new coalition the democratic liberal party excluded the 
leftist party for peace and democracy led by kim daejung who has 
denounced the merger as a de facto coup detat 
we must definitely succeed in the campaign and divulge a dirty 
political plot by the ruling group to hold on to power forever 
kim said 
he said opposition legislators should have sought voters 
consent before joining the governing party and the government 
even if kims campaign succeeds to sign up 10 million of south 
koreas 43 million people it has no binding force under law and 
the government has already rejected the opposition demand to move 
up the next general elections scheduled for early 1992 
kim said his party will also push for nationwide public rallies 
to appeal for new elections the first rally was scheduled for the 
western industrial city of buchon on sunday kim said 
the new governing party holds about 210 of the 299 seats in the 
national assembly enough to change the nations constitution at 
will the unicameral assembly had been controlled by the three 
opposition parties led by kims party 
founders of the new governing party said they wanted to bring 
stability to the countrys factionridden politics in which the 
three opposition parties had been unable to settle their own feuds 
to pass legislation

opposition to a bailout plan threatened to 
shut down the public transportation system in new yorks 
secondlargest city after tonights runs stranding 120000 bus and 
subway riders 
the potential shutdown also threatened chaos monday for more 
than 9700 public school students who use the transit system 
buffalo school officials said the students would have to find their 
own rides 
hospitals said they would encourage workers to form car pools 
and would look into renting private buses if necessary 
the board of niagara frontier transportation authority voted to 
shut down the system because only 89000 was available for a 
system that costs 55 million annually to run 
mayor james d griffin proposed friday to divert 9 million in 
anticipated erie county salestax revenue to keep the system going 
but county officials rejected the plan 
county officials earlier turned down utility property mortgage 
and gasoline taxes as potential sources of transit funds 
the mayor said the city which faces a 30 million deficit 
cant afford to give up its share of an expected increase in local 
salestax collections 
shutting down affects those people who dont appear to have 
any voice griffin said if we close down this system shame on 
all of us 
erie county executive dennis gorski said the mayors plan was 
not equitable 
he leaves out the part where property and school taxes across 
erie county will have to be raised to make up the difference 
gorski said any tampering with existing revenues means you steal 
from one pocket to fill another its a shell game 
riders said they were furious at the impending shutdown 
i think that if the nfta thinks that they can shut down the 
rapid transit on april fools day theyre nuts said robert 
orlando who rode the subway to thursdays buffalo sabres hockey 
game 
but some suburbanites didnt want to subsidize the system 
ive probably been on a bus twice in 23 years and i feel bad 
for the people who have to rely on them said gloria mitchell of 
suburban hamburg but id rather see them shut down than pay 
higher taxes for something we dont use they should raise the bus 
fares i dont feel we should pay for them 
meanwhile the transit agencys executive director alfred h 
savage accepted a 149500ayear post as head of the chicago 
transit authority savage resigned from the nfta on thursday 
saying he was fed up with the countys unwillingness to support 
public transit

a shiite moslem leader was quoted today 
as saying that the kidnappers holding western hostages in lebanon 
will not release them unless the united states helps free moslems 
imprisoned in kuwait and israel 
i dont believe that those who held the hostages for a year or 
two or even five years will let them loose free of charge 
hussein mousawi said in an interview broadcast by the voice of 
islam radio station in east lebanons ancient city of baalbek 
the interview was quoted today in beiruts independent annahar 
newspaper 
mousawi heads the prosyrian islamic amal wing of hezbollah or 
the party of god irans main shiite ally in lebanon he contended 
that hezbollah holds none of the 18 westerners missing in lebanon 
including eight americans 
we are not concerned with the hostage issue we do not have 
any hostage he said the hostages are held by security groups 
that maintain their individualities and take no orders from 
hezbollah or islamic amal 
hezbollah is widely believed to be the umbrella for various 
shiite hostageholding factions despite the partys public 
disclaimers 
mousawi said the demands made by the kidnappers were 
justified irrespective of the plight of the hostages he 
listed the release of 15 convicted terrorists imprisoned in kuwait 
for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait in 1983 and the 
release of arab prisoners in israeli jails 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war the group that holds 
american hostages terry anderson and thomas sutherland has long 
demanded freedom for he prisoners in kuwait 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the western hoatages he was abducted 
march 16 1985 
several other hostages have been held almost as long including 
sutherland acting dean of agriculture at the american university 
of beirut who was kidnapped in lebanon on june 9 1985 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine which holds 
kidnapped us professors alann steen robert polhill and jesse 
turner has demanded 400 lebanese and palestinian prisoners be 
freed from israeli jails 
israel has rejected the demand 
the united states and all those concerned with the hostages 
issue should consider the rights of these people and how to return 
some of them mousawi said 
america influences kuwait saudi arabia and israel things are 
intermingled in the domain of global arrogance but all revolve 
within americas sphere of influence he said 
if they want their hostages freed then they have to make some 
moves with the israelis the kuwaitis the saudis and the 
maronites maronites kidnapped brothers of ours believers iranian 
diplomats 
every usurped right is to be recovered we are not directly 
involved in this problem but this my personal analysis 
three iranian diplomats and their lebanese driver were seized by 
maronite christian militiamen in july 1982 all are believed to be 
dead

from the settlement state and federal authorities were meeting 
with mohawk representatives this morning to discuss the incident 
trooper richard garcia said 
the mohawk tribe doesnt recognize federal or state jurisdiction 
on the land 
busloads of people travel to the territory about 150 miles 
north of albany every friday evening to play highstakes bingo 
but the games were canceled friday night 
after mohawks refused to let troopers enter the land to 
investigate the shooting at least 20 troopers and an undetermined 
number of corrections officers blockaded the four roads leading to 
the territory garcia said 
weve turned back everybody said trooper fred curns who 
was at the scene well turn back everybody until the powers that 
be decide its safe to let them through 
the vermont army national guard helicopter was hit by three 
bullets fired from a rifle as it flew about 200 feet above the 
indian territory garcia said the settlement which police say is 
home to about 40 people is on 700 acres of stateowned parkland in

permitted to enter the territory since it was established in 1979 
we set up our own barricades to protect our people it was a 
natural thing for us to do martin said early today after indian

resolve the issue

feel theyre pointing the finger at us martin said theyre 
threatening to do whatever they have to

firebrand guerrilla leader gulbuddin 
hekmatyar has been replaced as foreign minister of the afghan 
rebels governmentin exile the official news agency of the 
resistance said today 
sibghatullah mojaddidi president of the socalled interim 
government said the post would be filled by burhanuddin rabbani 
the midia news agency reported 
rabbani the governmentinexiles minister of reconstruction 
is leader of the more moderate jamiatiislami the most 
politically and militarily organized group in the fractious 
sevenparty resistance based in pakistan 
rabbanis group is a bitter rival of the hezbiislami party 
headed by hekmatyar and there have been widespread reports of 
fierce fighting between the two groups 
the news agency said hekmatyar quit as foreign minister last 
year 
i had long ago decided to induct professor rabbani to this 
post but due to certain problems the decision was implemented 
now mojaddidi told midia 
the ministry of foreign affairs is very important and in view 
of this he rabbani has been appointed as foreign minister the 
news agency said 
hekmatyar 42 is known for his outspoken contempt of the west 
but despite the rhetoric he has received the bulk of the us 
arms sent to the moslem guerrillas during the nearly 12yearold 
war against the sovietbacked government of afghanistan 
he has been accused of killing other guerrillas and innocent 
afghans he also has been accused of theft opportunism and 
collusion with communists 
following the march 6 coup attempt in afghanistan the leaders 
of the other six parties quickly criticized hekmatyar for 
publically supporting the mutiny led by gen shah nawaz tanai the 
former defense minister of afghanistan who had vigorously opposed 
the kabul governments offers to talk peace 
troops loyal to afghan president najib eventually crushed the 
attempted coup and tanai defected to hekmatyars guerrillas

police fired rifles today to disperse 
about 5000 prodemocracy protesters wounding at least three 
people including a woman watching the demonstration from her 
house witnesses said 
the crowd had massed in the streets of the katmandu suburb of 
patan to protest the deaths of two demonstrators in a clash there 
friday in which about 30 policemen and 11 protesters were injured 
the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said police 
also used tear gas and made some arrests during todays protest 
but the witnesses did not know how many people were taken into 
custody 
i warned authorities to stop police repression against the 
people said kesar bahadur bista who represents patan in the 
rashtriya panchayat nepals partyless legislature 
siddhi lal a patan leftist leader said the fascist 
panchayat system used guns for stopping peoples rights so long as 
we dont get it democracy we will not forget it and we will 
carry the movement ahead 
on friday the himalayan kingdoms foreign minister quit over 
the crackdown on the movement for the restoration of multiparty 
democracy it was the first indication of discord in the government 
over how the crisis is being handled 
at least 14 people have been killed since feb 18 when king 
birendras government began cracking down on the spiraling 
movement hundreds of people including doctors lawyers students 
and journalists have been arrested 
the government says nepal already has a working democracy and 
accuses the agitators of trying to foist their brand of democracy 
a twoyear experiment with a westernstyle democracy in nepal 
ended in 1961 when king mahendra birendras father dismissed the 
government of the nowbanned nepali congress party accusing it of 
corruption and mismanagement 
shailendra kumar upadhyaya who resigned as foreign minister on 
friday said in an interview today that he decided to do so after 
prime minister marich man singh shrestha refused to heed his call 
to hold talks with the agitators 
i advised him not to take any attitude which would further 
deteriorate the situation upadhyaya said but he did not 
listen to me under such circumstances i found it immoral to 
remain in a cabinet headed by such a shortsighted person 
upadhyaya who served as nepals permanent representative to the 
united nations from 1972 to 1978 also said he condemned violence 
by agitators 
violence cannot be condoned the 60yearold politician 
said once the dialogue starts the violence will fizzle out 
the government has shown itself unwilling to hold talks with the 
protesters led by the nepali congress and a coalition of leftwing 
groups 
king birendra in his only comments on the movement said 
earlier this month that there would be no change in the composition 
of the legislature a key demand of the protesters 
onefifth of the nonpartisan assemblys 140 members are 
selected by the king the rest are elected but membership in 
political parties and political canvassing are banned

soldiers and their allied militiamen 
killed 112 rebels in fierce fighting in southern sudan the 
military command reported 
a statement issued late friday also said nine soldiers and 
militiamen were killed and 32 wounded in the fighting in southern 
sudans sprawling bahr elghazal region it did not say when the 
battles took place 
in addition to the 112 rebels killed a large number were 
wounded the statement said the military also said the rebel 
units commander was captured the militiamen are part of a newly 
formed popular defense force made up of civilian volunteers armed 
by the government to fight the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
it was impossible to verify the government statement because the 
south has been closed to outsiders for years due to the rebellion 
in a related development the newspaper alsudan alhadith 
quoted a senior military officer as saying that 350 rebels 
surrendered to the army last week in the upper nile region 
northeast of bahr elghazal 
the sudan peoples liberation army began fighting the government 
in 1983 
the movement based in the largely christian and animist south 
demands more regional autonomy from the moslemdominated central 
government animists do not worship a single god but believe 
everything in nature has a soul

in melbourne australia bridges went to sea and in 1920 arrived in 
san francisco two years later he became a longshoreman when 
conditions on the docks were considered the worst in the nation 
on july 5 1934 two dock workers were killed and 100 wounded 
when police charged a picket line the california national guard 
was called out prompting a general strike 11 days later 
the strike ended in three days with an agreement on a contract 
that established a unionoperated rather than employerrun hiring 
hall 
in a 1973 address to longshoremen in san francisco bridges 
said experience has taught that the union worker has one weapon 
no one else has and that is laying down his tools and quitting his 
job 
beginning in 1939 the federal government tried to kick bridges 
out of the country for 16 years charging the union leader was a 
communist and had falsely denied being a party member when he 
applied for citizenship he was once jailed for 20 days as a 
communist conspirator 
bridges acknowledged receiving help from communists in 1934 but 
always denied being a member of the communist party 
the us supreme court twice reversed orders for his deportation 
although bridges and the ilwu had appeared to have mellowed 
since the 1934 general strike the union exhibited renewed 
militancy in the summer and fall of 1971 when a strike shut west 
coast ports for 100 days

a conservative federal appeals judge has 
blocked a murderers execution in the california gas chamber 
leaving relatives of the killers teenage victims stunned and 
disappointed the state immediately appealed to the us supreme 
court 
tuesdays scheduled execution of robert alton harris which 
would have been the states first in 23 years was stayed friday by 
judge john noonan of the 9th us circuit court of appeals the 
judge said more study of harris mental state may be needed 
state attorney general john van de kamps emergency request to 
have the stay lifted was received at the supreme court this 
morning it was referred to supreme court justice sandra day 
oconnor who handles emergency matters from the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals in san francisco 
harris was convicted of abducting two san diego boys from a 
drivein restaurant in 1978 and fatally shooting them so he could 
use their car in a bank holdup both victims john mayeski and 
michael baker were 16 their bodies were found on a hillside 
several hours after the bank robbery 
the judges decision came after the us supreme court turned 
down four of harris previous appeals 
i was devastated i just couldnt believe it i was in a state 
of shock said mayeskis mother kathryn mayeski sanders after 
she heard of the decision after 11 years hes had every 
opportunity to plead his case 
i used to think that the death penalty wasnt the greatest 
thing but after going through this i dont think its too bad 
she added i hope no one has to go through all that we have had 
to go through 
bakers father san diego police detective steve baker arrested 
harris after the bank robbery without knowing that his son lay dead 
nearby the double murder was discovered after the elder baker 
leveled a shotgun at harris at the home of a friend to arrest him 
on the holdup 
im very disappointed baker said theyve looked at this 
case through a microscope for 12 years and cant seem to make a 
decision theres nothing i can do about it but take it as it 
comes 
noonan appointed to the appeals court in 1985 by president 
reagan and known mainly for his opposition to abortion ordered 
that harris be spared to allow arguments before a threejudge 
appeals panel on whether he should get an evidentiary hearing 
that process usually takes several months 
noonan said us district judge william enright who turned down 
harris lastditch appeal wednesday should have held a 
factfinding hearing on new psychiatric evidence submitted by the 
defense 
that evidence includes reports by psychologists who concluded 
that the psychiatric consultants who assisted harris trial lawyer 
acted incompetently by failing to test for brain damage or other 
serious mental disorders 
enright had rejected those conclusions without a hearing he 
said the dispute amounted to a mere disagreement among experts 
wasnt the states fault and wouldnt have affected the jurys 
decision in harris 1979 trial 
it is reasonably arguable and we cannot determine from this 
record whether harris received competent psychiatric assistance 
noonan said after a 50minute hearing in a packed courtroom 
were pleased that judge noonan listened to our argument 
and was not stampeded by the wave of public attention generated 
here said michael mccabe one of harris lawyers 
van de kamp said noonans ruling creates a brandnew legal 
right for accused murderers like robert harris the right to 
challenge the competency of psychiatric experts years after the 
fact 
gov george deukmejian said that justice has once again been 
indefinitely delayed and denied by a single federal judge 
it is unbelievable that this judge who reviewed this case for 
14 months would now at this last hour require further judicial 
proceedings the republican governor said 
mayeskis uncle william stalder said harris has had his day in 
court and should be executed 
this stuns me how many times does this guy have to be turned 
down this just keeps the wound open he said it keeps us 
waiting and waiting

chinas schools will stress patriotism and the 
virtues of socialism in lessons marking the 150th anniversary of a 
successful foreign attack on china a government official said 
today 
also today a senior chinese trade official appealed to the west 
to end trade restrictions imposed on china after troops brutally 
suppressed junes prodemocracy student demonstrations in beijing 
killing at least 500 people 
the vice minister of the state education commission teng teng 
said students must be drilled in the principles of socialism as 
part of a new patriotism campaign so that that they can gradually 
realize why china must take the socialist road and why the 
communist party must lead the way 
last week premier li peng urged students to study chinas 
struggle against britain in the opium war of 184042 to heighten 
their vigilance against the imperialistic strategy of peaceful 
evolution 
peaceful evolution refers to what chinas current hardline 
leaders describe as the wests attempt gradually to convert china 
to capitalism 
the 184042 war started when the qing dynasty tried to stop 
british opium sales in china britain easily defeated the chinese 
and in the 1842 treaty of nanking forced china to cede hong kong 
and open five ports to british trade 
teng said the lessons which will be increased in elementary and 
middle schools are necessary so that children will recognize the 
different channels used by the international hostile forces in 
their conspiracy to transform china into a vassal state 
ideological education has been stepped up in chinese schools and 
campuses since the suppression of the student prodemocracy 
movement 
regarding trade foreign economic relations and trade vice 
minister li lanqing criticized the economic sanctions imposed by 
the west after china used of force to end the movement 
he also said that if washington withdraws chinas 
mostfavorednation trade status the two nations relations will 
be seriously damaged 
chinas mostfavorednation status comes up for renewal in june 
and some members of congress have called for eliminating it because 
of chinas continued suppression of political dissent 
such a move would mean a significant rise in tariffs on chinese 
products and could seriously affect chinas exports to the united 
states beijings third biggest trading partner after hong kong and 
japan

by muting its response to the soviet show of 
military force in lithuania the west gave president mikhail s 
gorbachev proof of its commitment to his survival 
nearly three weeks into the soviet confrontation with the 
breakaway republic however analysts say no one knows what might 
provoke some kind of western retaliation 
theyve let gorbachev go pretty far jonathan isle director 
of the royal united services institute a londonbased research 
center said in an interview 
but all the nationalities of the soviet union now feel they 
also can go pretty far because gorbachev cannot afford to be 
transformed overnight from a nice cuddly figure to a communist 
dictator 
the united states and others in the west have urged gorbachev 
not to use force in lithuania but on friday president bush said he 
had assured the soviet president that were not trying to make 
things difficult for lithuania or the soviet union or anybody 
else 
the western stance has made many lithuanians feel betrayed and 
has angered western minorities like welsh nationalists and basques 
in spain who thrilled to the baltic republics declaration of 
independence march 11 
the west keeps saying it never recognized the incorporation of 
lithuania and the other baltic republics into the soviet union in 
1940 but we want some practical manifestations of support and 
were very very disappointed said alun thomas spokesman for 
plaid cymru the welsh nationalist party 
to some critics the cautious western response evoked echoes of 
1956 and 1968 when a very different kremlin crushed an 
antistalinist uprising in hungary and liberal reforms in 
czechoslovakia 
a remark by prime minister margaret thatcher reflected the sense 
of guilt about not helping hungary and czechoslovakia 
we still feel unease that the western world watched as the 
prague spring of 1968 was crushed by soviet tanks she told 
president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia when he visited london on 
march 21 
nonetheless she saw no point and considerable harm in the 
west getting tough over lithuania 
she appealed for restraint in a 50minute telephone conversation 
with gorbachev a week after meeting havel but government sources 
said she made no demands and trusted him to honor pledges that 
troops would not open fire and there would be no praguestyle 
military crackdown 
she always felt that if he said he would do something then he 
would carry it out a senior british official said on condition 
of anonymity he summed up the government attitude by saying of 
gorbachev hes riding a lot of tigers at once dont put 
intolerable pressure on the man 
the new statesman a leftleaning weekly said the apology to 
czechoslovakia should be matched by a forthright statement of 
support for lithuania 
gorbachev is still the man that bush thatcher and the rest 
want to do business with the man who can assure a stable and 
conservative european order yet this is the point between the 
rock and the hard place when anyone who believes in democracy must 
speak out it said in an editorial 
from the right the weekly economist said using military force 
in lithuania would be the beginning of the end for perestroika 
some people will argue that mr gorbachev is embarked on too 
vital a reform to be subjected to sanctions if he crushes 
lithuania it commented but if that is the course he chooses 
he will be saying that he is not the man and he does not see the 
soviet union as the kind of place that the west had been led to 
expect 
the scots welsh and basques sent messages of support to 
lithuania along with nationalist and linguistically separate 
groups in belgium and germany they have formed the european 
freedom alliance of 15 legislators in the 518member european 
parliament 
they are pressing for a europewide declaration of support for 
lithuania and feel the lithuanian example has helped their own 
causes 
its marvelous to see the emergence of nations who have been 
subsumed by an empire just as scotland has been subsumed by the 
british empire said margaret ewing a scottish nationalist in 
the house of commons 
outside the nationalist groups few see the issue in such 
straightforward terms 
dominic lieven a political scientist at the london school of 
economics said gorbachev never intended to let lithuania leave the 
soviet union without negotiations because of the precedent it 
would set 
it would be a standing incentive for other republics to do the 
same and for gorbachev that would be a short road to disaster 
he said in an interview 
for the western governments there are different pressures 
they know the complete disintegration of the soviet union would 
have an immensely destabilizing effect but first they also 
believe gorbachev is their best bet

congressional watchdogs continue to nip at the 
agriculture department in hopes the creaky old agency will 
modernize itself before the 20th century ends 
but the structure and inertia of usda are formidable attempts 
have been made for 45 years largely unsuccessful to streamline 
departmental field structure and management 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress has been studying usda organization and departmental 
inhibitions for at least two years a preliminary report was issued 
in december 
formal responses to gaos analysis will be sought from 
departmental agencies and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
when the final report is ready later in the year 
meanwhile the gao has followed up its initial review with a 
supplemental report to yeutter about the need for improved 
workforce planning in his department such planning should be 
mandatory the gao said 
at its simplest workforce planning means getting the right 
people in the right jobs now and over the long haul the object is 
to deliver government services to the public efficiently and 
economically 
the problems involve 36 agencies that carry out the departments 
policies and programs in 1988 the gao said those functions cost 
taxpayers more than 44 billion and required the services of 
110000 fulltime employees in more than 15000 places around the 
world 
usda agencies are experiencing problems recruiting highly 
skilled workers providing adequate training to employees 
developing effective managers and managing a culturally diverse 
workforce the latest report said these problems are 
longstanding pervasive and will likely continue given present 
trends in usda and in the federal government 
the growing importance of food safety water quality and 
biotechnology requires more scientists in usdas workforce yet a 
shortage of scientists generally as well as competition from the 
private sector put usda at a disadvantage 
moreover the report said agencies within usda sometimes find 
themselves competing against each other for people from the same 
job occupations a condition which is counterproductive from a 
departmental standpoint 
another inhibitor has been the lack of a departmental recruiting 
program each usda agency goes its own way and generally does not 
refer unneeded applicants to other agencies 
however the report noted that the departments office of 
personnel has recently contracted to develop a videotape for 
recruiting new employees 
as the agricultural economy becomes more consumerdriven than 
productionoriented usda needs employees with backgrounds in 
marketing management to supplement the skills of their other 
employees trained in the agricultural sciences the report said 
when the gao looked at employee training there were many 
indications of poorly or inadequately trained staff in a number 
of areas also the report cited continuing problems in achieving 
and maintaining an ethnically diverse workforce of women and 
minorities 
a major gao complaint is that department agencies generally 
address only a single years needs to patch up a problem when 
longrange remedies are in order this has been apparent in the 
farmers home administration and the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service for example 
but the report said some usda agencies are laying the 
groundwork for effective workforce planning 
for example the forest service uses a strategic human 
resource guide to forecast skillmix changes and attrition 
through 1995 the forecasts are used in preparing annual job 
recruitment recommendations and for measuring progress toward 
employment goals 
another is the animal and plant health inspection service which 
is reorganizing its personnel function to include workforce 
planning 
although these tentative steps toward workforce planning are 
encouraging without central direction and support the initiatives 
may be stifled and those agencies without workforce planning may 
never develop it the report said 
gao said department personnel leaders recognize the importance 
of workforce planning but have not taken a leadership role in 
developing guidance for agencies to follow nor have they 
instituted a mechanism for tracking and monitoring individual 
agency tracking systems 
the report acknowledged that department personnel officials 
recently organized a task force to improve usdas image as an 
employer and thereby enhancing its ability to recruit and retain 
quality employees 
but the gao also noted that the departments personnel office 
lacked the funds and people to operate the task force on its own 
so individual agencies were asked to chip in 
however there still exists no departmental policy on 
workforce planning the report said 
consistent workforceplanning standards and guidance are 
needed to encourage all agencies to initiate workforce planning and 
to reinforce agencies efforts already undertaken the report 
said

views of the western worlds gardens from 
central park in new york to a 700yearold german picture of 
fruitbearing palms in paradise go on display sunday as the 
greeting to spring from the national gallery of art 
in between is a painting of the huge vegetable and flower garden 
around the house where benjamin franklin stayed as the first 
official representative of the united states in paris in the 
background is the chateau valentinois owned by jacques de chaumont 
franklins host 
money for the show called gardens on paper came from estee 
lauder inc which makes perfumes and cosmetics 
the 106 prints and drawings all on paper or parchment came 
largely from the gallerys own collection they include work by 
watteau fragonard piranesi whistler pisarro and cassatt 
the first pictures were done in the middle ages and are more 
symbolic than realistic including images of the false paradise or 
garden of delights 
in these delicious perilous bowers lovers succumb to the 
promptings of the flesh and indulge in the pleasures of carnal 
love turning away from their pursuit of spiritual union with the 
divine in the true paradise the catalogue explains 
the images of carnal love are also symbolic however and 
unlikely to contribute to the current debate about whether museums 
should show pictures that some viewers and members of congress 
consider obscene in a 15th century flemish book of hours 
adam eve and the goldenhaired snake are all nude but unrevealing 
the catalogue was written by virginia tuttle clayton assistant 
curator of the gallerys department of prints and drawings 
other sections of the show cover the renaissance period and the 
18th and 19th centuries the one definitely 20th century work is 
the last maurice prendergasts central park 1900 
it closes on july 22 and unlike many of the gallerys shows 
will only be seen in washington

a major childcare assistance bill passed by 
the house would take away the only government help that many 
middleclass and upperincome families get for child care 
to provide funds for the 27 billion measure which primarily 
benefits lowerincome families democratic sponsors put limits on 
the dependentcare tax credit that is popular with many 
professionals and twoincome households 
more than 500000 taxpayers took the dependentcare credit in 
1986 the last year for which the internal revenue service could 
provide figures congressional tax estimates figure roughly 900000 
would be affected in 1991 
families of all income levels are eligible for the credit 
designed to offset a portion of child care expenses 20 percent to 
30 percent depending on income of eligible expenses up to 4800 
but the house bill would reduce the credit for families with 
combined incomes over 70000 a year and end it entirely at 90000 
families at that level are regarded as upper income and 
affluent and they had few defenders in the house debate 
some lawmakers did have reservations about eliminating the 
deduction they said the issue is more complex than merely soaking 
the rich or targeting the yuppies 
in many states 70000 translates into a familiy headed by 
two police officers or two teachers said rep pat schroeder 
dcolo who voted for the bill anyway 
the heart of the childcare assistance bill which passed 
thursday after months of wrangling is an expansion of the earned 
income tax credit which goes to working families with children and 
incomes up to about 20000 
the house bill which is under a threat of veto by president 
bush is headed for a conference committee to resolve differences 
with the senates version 
the bill the senate passed last year does not reduce the 
dependentcare credit it is less costly than the house version and 
provides smaller tax credits to the poor 
a sponsor of the house bill rep thomas downey dny had 
little sympathy for those seeking to save the credit the house 
bill includes money to establish a system of day care based in the 
public schools that would be available to all families for a price 
downey said that was a good tradeoff for middle class and more 
affluent families 
youll notice a lack of the wagging of tongues on this 
issue downey said it was not a topic of debate there was 
fulsome recognition of the reality that middle class people needed 
to be taken care of and the way to do that was the 
afterschool program 
the revenue recovered by cutting the credit is relatively small 
the congressional budget office put the amount at 15 billion over 
five years sponsors came up with another 13 billion by extending 
the telephone excise tax but even with that the bill would add to 
the federal deficit 
womens groups have been watching closely as congress fashions 
the bill with 64 percent of women working outside the home child 
care is a business expense just as necessary as a salesmans car 
said nancy duff campbell managing partner of the national womens 
law center a lobbying group 
if youre going to take away workrelated benefits thats 
fine but do it across the board not just for dependents and child 
care do it for business lunches and luxury trips she said 
what we object to is singling out this benefit thats so 
important to women 
the credit covers more than just child care also affected are 
the expenses of special care for other dependents such as an 
infirm parent or disabled spouse or older child 
and it affects currently untaxed employer benefits she said 
for people above the cutoff level employeroffered child care 
programs at free or reduced cost will become a taxable benefit 
eliminating the credit has been attempted before house 
democrats included it in the 1988 welfare reform bill but it was 
eliminated in the senate where sen bill bradley dnj attacked 
the move as robbing jill to pay jane

israel is unlikely to stage a preemptive 
strike against iraq despite revelations that the arab nation may 
have an advanced nuclear weapons program political analysts said 
saturday 
iraq now has missiles and they are telling us in so many 
words that they will be using them if we strike said amatzia 
baram an iraq specialist at haifa university i dont think 
israel would be foolish enough to start this kind of cycle of 
violence 
the situation in the middle east has changed since 1981 he 
said referring to israels bombing of an iraqi nuclear reactor 
that israel said could have been used to produce nuclear weapons 
iraq said the facility was to be used for peaceful purposes 
us newspaper reports citing classified cia material have 
said iraq has positioned missile launchers in the western part of 
the country within range of tel aviv 
the israeli government has not commented following wednesdays 
arrest in london of five people in an alleged plot to smuggle 
nuclear weapons triggers to iraq 
we have no comment on it its something that happened between 
england and iraq foreign ministry spokesman yossi amihud said 
saturday aides to prime minister yitzhak shamir have also refused 
to comment 
political observers said israels verbal restraint was a sign 
that it did not want to escalate tensions with iraq one of its 
most implacable enemies in the middle east 
iraq meanwhile has accelerated its rhetoric responding to the 
arrests in britain iraqs deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoun 
said the current british campaign is trying to provide the 
groundwork for an israeli aggression against iraq reminding us of 
the year 1981 
but baram said another strike was unfeasible he noted that in 
1981 the osirak nuclear reactor near baghdad provided a clear 
target for israeli warplanes but iraqs current nuclear program is 
spread across the country 
there is no easily identifiable target that you hit and then 
get rid of the whole nuclear option he said there doesnt 
seem to exist anywhere an atomic reactor 
israeli military analysts have estimated that iraq is less than 
five years away from developing nuclear weapons and that it was 
making rapid strides in producing other unconventional weapons 
they are making an effort not only in the nuclear field but 
also with regards to missiles to chemical weapons and to 
biological weapons said zeev eitan a senior analyst with tel 
aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic studies in an 
interview with israel radio broadcast saturday 
political analysts agreed with baram that hostilities between 
israel and iraq were unlikely in the near future because of mutual 
deterrence but warned that a major crisis in the middle east could 
set off a confrontation between the regions two mightiest military 
powers

the nations minimum wage increases for the 
first time in nearly a decade sunday but it wont lift millions of 
lowwage workers above the poverty level 
the minimum wage paid to about 3 million americans increases 
from 335 an hour to 380 and will go to 425 an hour next april 
1 the new law also establishes a subminimum training wage for 
certain teenage workers 
critics say the increase should have been greater 
right now its not at a level where people can pull 
themselves out of poverty said jo ann mort of the amalgamated 
clothing and textile workers union 
when people hear minimum wage they think children working 
after school and thats not the reality of it the reality is that 
adults are trying to support families on this mort said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass last week called the size of 
the increase a disgrace and said he would push congress next 
year to bring the wage to a level that is fair to millions of 
workers who are being unfairly exploited now 
kennedy blamed the size of the increase on the bush 
administration which vetoed a proposal last year to raise the wage 
to 455 an hour 
the increase was the best we could do against an antiworker 
administration that refuses to do justice for americas working 
poor said kennedy chairman of the senate labor and human 
resources committee 
the administration considers the increase an equitable boost 
that will result in fewer jobs being lost than under the 455 
proposal white house spokesman stephen hart said 
polls have shown a majority of americans support a minimum wage 
of at least 5 an hour 
the minimum wage was established in 1938 as part of the first 
fair labor standards act during its first 40 years congress acted 
six times to keep the rate at about 50 percent of the average 
hourly earnings of all nonsupervisory employees 
the 335 rate which equaled 48 percent of the national average 
earnings in 1981 fell to an alltime low of 35 percent of the 
nations average earnings last year according to the aflcio 
after sundays increase fulltime minimumwage workers will 
still be 516 a year short of what the government figures it takes 
to support a family of two at the poverty level and 4796 below 
the basic needs level for a family of four the government placed 
the poverty level for a family of four at 12700 in february 
still the boost in the minimum wage may help millions of other 
lowpaid workers for instance companies paying 4 or 450 an 
hour may decide to raise wages 45 cents to keep trained workers 
there are more than 11 million americans making less than 450 
an hour and nearly 15 million making under 5 an hour according to 
the labor department 
under the new law workers ages 16 to 19 may be paid a 
subminimum training wage for their first three months in the work 
force and for an additional 90 days if the employer has a formal 
training program 
the training wage will be 335 an hour when the minimum wage 
rises to 380 an hour and 362 an hour when the minimum wage 
reaches 425 next april migrant seasonal farmworkers are exempt 
from the subminimum and the entire subminimum provision expires in 
april 1993 
the wage that employers are required to pay workers who receive 
tips will increase to 45 percent of the minimum wage providing 
that tips bring workers hourly pay to at least the minimum the 
percentage which was 40 percent before sunday goes to 50 percent 
a year from now 
the level at which small businesses are exempt from the federal 
minimum wage increases from 362500 in gross sales to 500000 
hundreds of special exemptions exist such as for some farm 
workers including tobacco leaf harvesters casual babysitters 
newspaper delivery workers amusement park employees wreath 
makers employees at small radio stations in cities with fewer than 
25000 residents and mollusk and crustacean harvesters

there is a potentially explosive witches 
brew cooking inside 177 nuclear waste storage tanks at the hanford 
nuclear reservation 
surrounded by steel and concrete buried under several feet of 
earth and roasting at temperatures of 140 degrees the radioactive 
slurry changes in ways that scientists cannot always predict 
scientists working for the us department of energy concluded 
that hydrogen gas trapped beneath the hard crust of the waste in 20 
of the tanks could explode releasing up to 3 million curies of 
radiation from a single tank 
the wastes are generated by nuclear weapons production 
hanford was created as part of the manhattan project to beat 
nazi germany to the atomic bomb during world war ii the department 
of energy in a costcutting move recently announced it is 
shutting down the only federal reactor still operating in the 
southcentral washington town 
weve got good data on what went into those tanks don 
wodrich a scientist with contractor westinghouse hanford co said 
last week but over the years it blended together and mixed now 
its more complicated 
the insides of the tanks are far too lethal for human entry all 
scientists can do is monitor the temperature and vapors escaping 
through filtered vents and occasionally send a probe into the guck 
but probes of the 20 suspect tanks have been stopped because 
scientists fear a spark could trigger an explosion 
the explosion potential was announced march 23 along with a 
unique admission that doe really isnt sure how dangerous the 
situation is the agency said it will take until june to come up 
with a solution plan 
that has prompted criticism from congress and a citizens 
watchdog group who contend the department knew about the danger 
years ago 
the energy department have stated repeatedly that the explosion 
risk is low although they will not have a safety analysis 
completed for two weeks 
spokesman ken morgan has said there is more danger to the public 
from a gasoline truck than from the tanks and called the 
controversy the cold fusion of disasters referring to the 
highly disputed claim that the nuclear process known as fusion can 
be created in an ordinary laboratory 
that attitude infuriates hanford critics 
they dont fully accept their responsibility to protect public 
health and safety said jim thomas of the hanford education 
action league in spokane they should have been doing risk 
analysis on this stuff years ago 
energy department officials insisted last week they became aware 
of the explosion potential only in february even though they 
detected hydrogen in the wastes as early as 1983 
hanford manager mike lawrence in announcing the problem said 
he had become aware of the danger only the day before if that is 
the case said thomas then hanford apparently has major management 
problems 
rep ron wyden dore said a study prepared for the energy 
department in june 1985 warned of potential problems with gases in 
some hanford tanks that report examined only the liquid and solid 
waste in the tanks but said the gases should be addressed in 
another study 
wyden said the 1985 report seems to contradict this whole 
notion that the energy department didnt know anything about it 
the 1985 hydrogen study was a companion to another study on 
whether ferrocyanide in some tanks could explode the ferrocyanide 
report was leaked to reporters last october 
under criticism for its handling of that issue the energy 
department decided to take a broader look at the explosion 
potential in all hanford tanks and scientists discovered the 
hydrogen problem in late february scientist wodrich said 
the explosion threat is apparently not similar to the presumed 
cause of a nuclear waste storage tank explosion in the soviet union 
in 1957 that may have killed hundreds 
al conklin of the state office of radiation protection said the 
soviet explosion involved a different mixture of chemicals and a 
lengthy breakdown of the tanks cooling system 
the doe is most concerned about one tank called 101sy that 
contains 1 million gallons of mixed radioactive waste some wastes 
dumped into the tank in the 1970s contained organics which are now 
decomposing and giving off hydrogen gas the organics were used to 
separate radioactive strontium from other wastes before they were 
stored 
the most dangerous gases are those trapped in air pockets under 
the hard crust scientists are unsure how much gas is beneath the 
waste although they credit the gas with raising the waste level by 
up to 33 inches 
wodrich said doe officials are confident the explosion risk is 
low because the hydrogen gas has apparently existed in the waste 
for years and that new precautions are being taken to prevent an 
explosion 
in a briefing for state regulators wodrich said tank 101sy was 
completed in 1976 and is 75 feet in diameter and 35 feet tall the 
doublewalled tank contains about 32 feet of waste 
the tank also contains 8000 gallons of water inserted in 
19841988 when doe made an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the gas 
buildup by breaking through the crust the crust develops from the 
drying of the wastes

incomes fell again in latin america last year 
deepeningt an overall decline for the decade of the 1980s 
according to a report published saturday by the interamerican 
development bank 
production in the area grew by only 07 percent for the year 
since population grew by about 24 percent a year more than three 
times as fast the average persons income went down 
incomes declined by 8 percent over the 10 years back to the 
level of 1978 
the regions disappointing overall growth masks good 
performance in a number of countries the report said 
it added that many have acted to improve their performance in 
the 1990s but it warned 
without sustained expansion in investment output and 
employment the deterioration in living conditions suffered by 
large segments of the regions population during the 1980s will 
continue in the decade ahead 
the last two countries to emerge from dictatorship chile and 
paraguay turned in the best records 
after a sharp decline in the first half of the 1980s production 
in chile perked up to an exceptional 85 percent last year that 
growth rate combined with a population increase smaller than most 
countries in the area gave it by far the best increase in incomes 
but according to the world bank the average chilean received 
the equivalent of only 1510 in 1988 the latest year for which 
figures are available that is well below the level for the area 
the average brazilian earned 2280 the average mexican 1820 
and the average us citizen 19780 
production in seven out of 25 countries declined last year with 
the biggest drop in peru 14 percent perus record was due in part 
to a continuing leftist rebellion by shining path guerrillas 
brazil and mexico latin americas most populous countries 
managed 3 percent increases in production despite problems with 
debt and inflation 
the bank itself owned by 44 member countries disbursed a 
record 25 billion in loans and spent a record 61 million on 
technical aid last year it has loans outstanding on 122 billion 
worth of projects designed to raise living standards in the area 
after a threeyear slump the amount of new loans approved rose 
in 1989 to 26 billion 
the increases came after three years of negotiation by the 
united states and other contributing governments to get more power 
over the banks lending 
they can now delay a proposed loan for as long as a year the 
bank has also begun a program of quicklydisbursed loans 
conditioned on promises by the borrowing countries to change their 
policies and put themselves in better condition to repay

americans are being asked to sit down take 
out a pencil and count themselves on sunday 
its the 21st time the united states has taken its own measure 
and like a youngster standing against the wall the result is 
bigger every time 
our goal for the 1990 census is to count every person resident 
in the united states said thomas murrin deputy secretary of 
commerce we are ready and confident 
its important to answer the census its safe to answer the 
census said census director barbara everitt bryant stressing 
that information on individuals is kept confidential 
the national count isnt just a case of idle curiosity on the 
part of the government 
the constitution requires a count every 10 years to reassign 
seats in the house of representatives among the states 
and other information collected is used to determine the need 
for many social programs and to decide which states cities and 
towns most need federal money to help their residents in one way or 
another 
in many respects the census is an index to our quality of 
life said john g keane of notre dame university former head of 
the census bureau the census shows us anew where our nation 
hurts and needs help 
recite the national agenda and we realize how its resolution 
is directly or indirectly rooted in census data he said 
the aging population births deaths education household 
composition housing quality income and poverty fertility single 
parent families occupations population mobility disability the 
homeless are just a few examples of what the census covers keane 
said 
census forms were sent to about 85 million homes 10 days ago 
and government workers will visit millions more where mailing lists 
were not available 
most people got the short form with just 14 questions the long 
form which went to one home in six has much more detail forming 
a sort of giant national survey 
although sunday is officially designated as census day many 
people completed their forms and sent them in ahead of time 
thats just fine with the government 
its the folks who dont respond who are a problem 
far too many people approach the census as a hohum event 
they should not for the census is vital to our way of life and our 
quality of life said keane 
a decade ago 75 percent of the people who received forms in the 
mail completed them and sent them back 
the country is bigger and more complex today the bureau is 
hoping to get back 70 percent this time 
sending workers out to find people who dont respond costs 
taxpayers 10 million for each 1 percent 
yet the bureau is determined to come as close as possible to 
counting everyone 
we are prepared to chase and chase and chase again said 
bryant 
but while the count is getting lots of attention right now 
dont expect instant results its not like an election where 
preliminary reports come out based on a few precincts or cities 
the census bureau keeps all the data it collects strictly 
confidential until it can be compiled into detailed reports and 
then made public in such a way that no individuals can be 
identified from the material 
the first result from the count wont be reported until dec 31 
when the bureau as to tell the president how many people live in 
each state and how many members of the house of representatives 
that state is entitled to 
more detailed reports on individual states will be issued 
starting after the first of the year the schedule isnt determined 
yet depending on how well things go in individual states 
those reports will include such information as age sex race 
and household relationships marital status whether people are 
hispanic or not and a variety of housing data

the number of western journalists covering 
lithuanias standoff with moscow from the baltic republics capital 
has dropped sharply since the soviet government ordered the area 
closed to most foreigners 
more than 100 journalists based in moscow and other european 
capitals followed events from the lithuanian capital but most were 
expected to be out of vilnius on sunday only a handful remained on 
saturday 
despite the greater freedom of movement permitted under 
glasnost soviet authorities have routinely closed areas stricken 
by ethnic violence to foreign journalists some regions regarded as 
strategically or politically sensitive are closed at all times 
others only temporarily 
the order restricting journalists access to lithuania came as 
the kremlin increased pressure on the rebellious republic and as 
lithuanian leaders sought to use the western media to protect them 
from a use of force to crush their effort to establish an 
independent state 
moscowbased foreign journalists must give the soviet foreign 
ministry advance notice of any plans to travel outside the soviet 
capital including the dates and means of their travel and where 
they will stay outside moscow 
the soviet government may refuse to permit the trip temporarily 
closing areas to foreigners the foreign ministry on march 23 
stopped permitting most moscowbased reporters from traveling to 
lithuania and ordered a number of diplomats out of the republic 
however journalists already in lithuania were permitted to stay 
four days later foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskykh 
told a moscow news briefing that foreigners have been asked to 
leave the borders of lithuania and temporarily refrain from 
entering its territory 
most correspondents accredited by the foreign ministry began 
returning to moscow but the associated press and some other 
organizations kept their journalists in place until contacted 
directly by foreign ministry officials 
on friday foreign ministry officials called news organizations 
with correspondents remaining in vilnius and said they must leave 
by sunday 
the ap which still had a reporter and two photographers 
covering the story said it would comply with the ministrys 
instructions by the deadline

president bush is rooting for both sides in 
the battle of wills between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and the breakaway republic of lithuania 
on the one hand bush defends the right of selfdetermination 
for lithuania 
on the other hand he doesnt want to see gorbachev weakened or 
driven from power as a result of lithuanias push to secede from 
the soviet union 
despite us warnings against using force gorbachev faces 
mounting pressures at home to take a hard line toward lithuania 
officials say and there is a widespread belief in washington that 
a crackdown would produce a severe backlash against moscow 
we have big equities in this a senior administration 
official said 
it isnt in anybodys interest to have this thing blow up 
the official added nobody really wins from the blowup 
bush sent gorbachev a letter thursday night which white house 
officials said restated us views on lithuania and underscored 
hopes for a peaceful dialogue to resolve the dispute 
i want to be sure that the soviets understand our position and 
understand that were not trying to make things difficult for 
lithuania or the soviet union or anybody else bush said 
yet the administration ordered a postponement of a visit to 
moscow by gen carl e vuono the us army chief of staff his 
host would have been the soviet commander in lithuania and us 
officials said that would have been inappropriate 
a crackdown would spoil lithuanian dreams of independence give 
the soviets a black eye in world opinion and disrupt the smooth 
path of superpower relations us officials say 
the casualties could include hopes for a ussoviet nuclear 
weapons treaty as well as agreements on chemical weapons and 
conventional forces in europe as well as a planned summit between 
bush and gorbachev 
it is fair to say that if president gorbachev resorts to 
force then all bets are off senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan warned 
the soviets will be in real trouble here no trade 
agreements no trade preferences and no more of the kind of 
relations the kremlin is desperately seeking from washington 
dole said it would be a severe blow to ussoviet relations 
white house officials agree with doles assessment but have 
muted their criticisms and warnings their goal is not to push 
gorbachev into a corner where it would be difficult for him to make 
concessions 
were it not for gorbachev and the enlightened positions hes 
taken we wouldnt be talking about lithuanian independence 
the administration official said 
the administration points to gorbachev as the architect of 
reform in his country who tolerated democratic reforms throughout 
eastern europe 
sure we have a preferred outcome for the lithuanians the 
official said but we also have and the world has some pretty 
big equities in whats going on now and so what were trying to do 
is preserve those as well 
one theory circulating among highlevel officials in the 
administration is that gorbachev is trying to slow the lithuanian 
process until he can get a bill through the supreme soviet spelling 
out terms for secession 
its pretty stiff one official said of gorbachevs bill 
there are pretty high barriers to get across 
in contrast to other foreign policy issues bush has been spared 
criticism from congress about his guarded approach 
sen alfonse damato rny said congress is playing a 
supporting role in a classic good copbad cop routine 
our role is to demand independence today even though it may 
not be possible for a month damato said it is to be 
outspoken i think we can be a useful tool for bush and i dont 
mind lending ourselves for that purpose 
sen pete wilson rcalif said bush is obviously engaged in 
a very difficult balancing act 
there is concern that gorbachev not be pushed into a 
precipitous act that time be gained whereby there can be a 
negotiation that will let gorbachev save face and still bring about 
the independence and freedom of lithuania wilson said 
the administration is unsure what will happen in lithuania 
our first objective is to try to prevent a blowup try to 
get things down reduce tensions stop ultimatums from being 
issued preconditions get people talking calmly and rationally 
the senior official said 
however the official said if gorbachev is trying to keep 
lithuania in and the lithuanians are trying to get out they both 
cant win yet the official added there are possible avenues 
for compromise such as giving lithuania sovereignty but requiring 
it to defer to moscow on foreign policy and defense issues 
there are lots of different ways the official concluded

the incumbent lithuanian leadership does not heed the voice of 
reason it continues to ignore the decision of the third 
extraordinary congress of ussr peoples deputies and is taking 
unilateral steps that run counter to the ussr constitution and 
that are openly challenging and insulting to the entire union 
i want to declare yet again that this road is ruinous and will 
only lead to a dead end 
i urge the deputies of the lithuanian supreme soviet to 
understand this truth and their historical responsibility for the 
interests of the people of lithuania lithuanians and 
nonlithuanians for their security and well being for the destiny 
of democracy in the whole of our country and of stability in the 
world 
i propose that the lithuanian supreme soviet immediately annul 
the illegal acts it has adopted such a step will open a 
possibility for discussing the entire range of problems on the 
solely acceptable basis within the framework of the ussr

the war on drugs picks up new recruits 
here sunday when each person who buys something in jackson county 
begins chipping in to help authorities arrest jail and treat 
abusers 
the kansas city metropolitan area faced with one of the 
nations worst drug problems is raising taxes by an estimated 14 
million a year to help authorities tackle a drug culture boosted by 
the infiltration of los angeles gangs 
the onequartercent rise in sales tax will generate nearly 100 
million over its sevenyear life from overthecounter sales in 
jackson county which incorporates kansas city and its suburbs 
the nations 29th largest metropolitan area ranks sixth in the 
availability of crack and police believe that onethird or moer of 
last years 141 killings were drugrelated 
i am not aware of any approach like it in the united states 
said larry myers administrator of the jackson county juvenile 
court i guarantee there are other communities watching to see 
what the outcome is 
voters in jackson county authorized the tax in november since 
then officials have been putting together plans to use the money 
it will enable the county prosecutor to add about 25 prosecutors 
to his staff and the kansas city police department and the jackson 
county drug enforcement task force to hire 30 more officers each 
that will cost each department 15 million a year 
the campaign focuses primarily on enforcement but 25 million 
a year is earmarked for drug rehabilitation programs 1 million 
for community crime prevention programs and 15 million for a 
deferral program that would allow firsttime offenders to receive 
drug counseling and avoid criminal charges 
im really excited about this because its systemwide myers 
said if it was only law enforcement itd be just stacking up 
kids and adults in the court system 
kansas citys drug problems have mushroomed in recent years and 
police chief larry joiner said enforcement officials estimate 35 
percent to 40 percent of last years 141 homicides were 
drugrelated police say the problems have been aggravated in 
recent years by los angeles gangs spreading their drugdealing to 
midwest cities 
police in outlying suburban areas also welcome the additional 
funds 
we dont have the numbers of crack houses and dope houses or 
people soliciting off the street corners like they do in kansas 
city said howard brown chief of police in blue springs an 
eastern jackson county community of about 40000 
but we do have a drug problem theres no doubt its not 
running rampant but there are drugs available in the school system 
thats one thing we want to make drugfree 
brown will be able to hire three officers for his 45member 
staff once theyre trained they will replace three seasoned 
officers who will be assigned to the expanded county drug task 
force begun three years ago with a private donation and kept going 
through federal grants 
the county task force has been operating on a shoestring 
brown said were pretty enthused now that well have enough 
people to really hit the streets and enough money to get involved 
in making more buys 
but others foresee problems with the tax and the programs it 
will finance 
charles megerman the county corrections director says he 
doesnt know what the drug program will mean for a jail already 
filled well beyond capacity 
there are a whole host of options from renting space to 
doublebunking to building a new jail he said 
and jack hackley a real estate agent from suburban oak grove 
and a member of the county economic development commission who 
spoke out against the new tax said he might start a petition drive 
to repeal it 
hackley said the tax swept in on the strength of national 
hysteria over drugs and thinks the extent of the drug problem has 
been grossly exaggerated 
this is the biggest mistake the taxpayers have ever made he 
said it should be repealed immediately for all that money we 
could take every drug addict in jackson county and ship them to the 
betty ford clinic

premier xenophon zolotas on saturday fired 
greeces intelligence service chief because he was late in briefing 
him on allegations that his agency was jamming the broadcasts of an 
illegal tv station 
zolotas summoned the heads of the four ministries and national 
information service chief dimitris angelopoulos to an emergency 
meeting the government spokesman said the meeting was called 
after two intelligence agents were arrested friday night and 
accused of jamming transmissions of the channel 29 television 
station 
angelopoulos arrived at the meeting two hours late and was 
dismissed 
mr angelopoulos showed inexcusable negligence in the 
performance of his duties by not immediately briefing his superior 
in this case the prime minister who had sought him repeatedly and 
with every means at his disposal government spokesman prokopis 
pavlopoulos said 
the commercial channel 29 television station one of several 
operating without a license aired footage of two men being 
arrested on mount hymettos near athens it accused them of using 
electronic equipment to jam broadcasts from the stations nearby 
antenna 
the two men were released after the intelligence service assured 
police and judicial authorities that they were agents acting on 
official orders the public order ministry said in a statement it 
did not eleborate 
zolotas ordered an inquiry into the incident by the public 
order justice and transport and communications ministries 
the government urged political parties to maintain a calm 
climate before next weeks general elections 
the socialists who are supported by channel 29 accused the 
conservative new democracy party of being behind the alleged 
jamming the conservatives denied involvement and urged an official 
inquiry into the matter

a variety of pressures on both sides in el 
salvadors civil war have created the most favorable climate for a 
peaceful settlement since the conflict began a decade ago 
according to us officials 
the new mood has been highlighted by the plans of salvadoran 
government officials and leftist guerrilla representatives to hold 
peace talks with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
next wednesday in geneva 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said he is hopeful a 
peace settlement can be reached this year the death toll in el 
salvador since 1980 is believed to exceed 70000 
the electoral defeat of the sandinista government in nicaragua 
five weeks ago is seen as a costly blow to the rebels in light of 
the support they have received from that country for more than a 
decade 
the us officials speaking only on condition they not be 
named said the sandinistas have sharply increased military 
deliveries to the rebels since the feb 25 elections the 
sandinista goal apparently is to help the rebels as much as 
possible before they leave office on april 25 
still the rebels are not the same fighting force they were a 
year ago much of their strength was sapped in a november military 
uprising that failed to touch off the nationwide antigovernment 
uprising which us officials said the rebels had hoped for 
internationally support for a negotiated settlement is strong 
the soviet union reflecting a changed attitude issued an appeal 
last november during the rebel offensive for an immediate end to 
the bloodshed and for peace talks 
the soviet statement contrasted sharply with the expressions of 
strong support for the guerrillas by cuban president fidel castro 
the future of cuban aid to the rebels is now in doubt with the 
defeat of the sandinistas cuba routinely has used nicaragua as a 
transit point for military deliveries to the fmln rebels us 
officials have said 
the government of salvadoran president alfredo cristiani also is 
facing pressures to seek an accommodation 
peace would bring a needed lift to the salvadoran economy whose 
performance has been aggravated by falling prices of coffee a 
major salvadoran export 
salvadoran officials also are aware that there are limits to the 
generosity of the united states which contributed more than 3 
billion in aid during the 1980s 
after reaching 3014 million last year the us economic aid 
level for 1990 is 2279 million a drop of about 25 percent 
the decline reflects us weariness with the salvadoran conflict 
and the increased demands on us aid dollars brought on by the 
addition of new recipient countries in eastern europe 
moreover sen chris dodd dconn is leading a campaign to 
impose strict conditions on us military aid totaling almost 
100 million to el salvador 
his proposal designed to promote a serious negotiating process 
is expected to be a contentious issue in the congress this spring 
us officials are worried that the dodd proposal could weaken 
the salvadoran governments negotiating hand but they also stress 
that the rebels bargaining position also is weak regardless of 
the outcome of the dodd proposal 
the final form of a peace settlement is difficult to predict at 
a minimum the officials said it would probably have to require 
amnesty for rebel combatants and government security guarantees for 
them

stung by extraditions and military 
raids drug traffickers threatened saturday to explode sixton 
dynamite bombs in bogota and to target more judges politicians 
police and journalists for assassination 
the threat from the medellin cocaine cartel in a communique 
followed the governments extradition of a drug suspect to the 
united states last week its first in two months and its 
takeover of a town run by drug bosses 
president virgilio barco said in a televised speech to the 
nation friday night that his government would not ease up in its 
war on the traffickers he was to leave sunday for paris london 
and brussels to press european leaders to work hard to stem cocaine 
consumption in their countries 
the drug traffickers message sent by facsimile to the rcn 
radio network demanded an immediate end to the military occupation 
of envigado the town seized last week and the release of two men 
arrested in the takeover 
the 80000resident municipality is a stronghold of the cocaine 
barons near their home base of medellin 
the message said a sixton bomb would be detonated in the 
capital for each new trafficking suspect extradited and that a bomb 
of equal power would be set off in an unnamed bogota upper class 
neighborhood unless the military ends its occupation of envigado 
on dec 6 a 1200pound bomb set off by the traffickers in 
bogota killed 63 people and destroyed the headquarters of 
colombias national police 
the traffickers declared a unilateral ceasefire on jan 17 
appealing to the government to end extraditions in exchange for the 
traffickers allowing themselves to be tried in colombian courts 
the government then halted extraditions but resumed them 
wednesday when it sent fernando gutierrez 29 to face trial in 
arizona on drug trafficking and money laundering charges he was 
the 15th such suspect extradited since barco launched a crackdown 
on the traffickers aug 18 
the communique was attributed to the extraditables the name 
adopted by the medellin cartel after traffickers responded to 
barcos crackdown with a campaign of bombings and assassinations 
that has claimed at least 210 lives 
there was no way to verify the authenticity of the message 
however the extraditables have used the same format and means of 
communication in the past 
the countrys national security council ordered the army and 
antiterrorism units from the national police into envigado where 
18 policemen accused of being on the traffickers payroll had been 
arrested over the past two weeks 
the message from the named the two men arrested in envigado as 
jose cristanto retavista garzon and fredy lopez ospina 
neither is a major trafficker but the cartel has hundreds of 
middlelevel traffickers and soldiers 
the message reiterated previous claims that the police are 
arresting torturing and killing friends of the traffickers 
who are responsible for some 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled 
into the united states 
we will execute judges traitorous politicians torturers and 
principal members of the cano family it said 
drug traffickers killed the papers publisher guillermo cano 
with a burst of submachine gun fire as he left the newspapers 
officies on dec 17 1987 
el espectador had been crusading for government action against 
the traffickers canos brother sons and nephews continue to run 
the newspaper which was partially destroyed by a truck bomb last 
year 
a truck bomb set off by traffickers last year heavily damaged 
the newspaper which had to go to the united states to look for 
financial aid to keep publishing 
the threat by the traffickers to set off sixton dynamite bombs 
is not likely to be dismissed by the government 
targets in the traffickerss terror campaign have included a 
colombian airliner which was blown apart by a bomb during a 
domestic flight killed all 106 people aboard small bombs have 
gone off at churches schools supermarkets banks and other 
businesses 
for its part the government has killed one of the medellin 
cartels leaders gonzalo rodriguez gacha it also has seized 
traffickers mansions ranches airplanes and yachts and troops 
searching dozens of the traffickers ranches have found 43 million 
in cash and gold 
the countrys judges and leading politicians have been under 
heavy guard since aug 18 when traffickers gunned down leading 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan during a campaign rally 
last week another presidential candidate leftist bernardo 
jaramillo ossa was killed 
in a communique traffickers claimed responsibility and said the 
frontrunner in the race cesar gaviria of the governing liberal 
party would be next the elections are scheduled for may 26

the african national congress 
on saturday postponed talks with the government on dismantling 
apartheid saying that police shootings of black protesters have 
soured the negotiating climate 
the move was considered a serious setback for efforts by the 
government of president fw de klerk to open blackwhite 
discussions de klerk expressed regret over the violence but urged 
the anc to reconsider its postponement 
nelson mandela the ancs deputy president told tens of 
thousands of supporters that an april 11 meeting with the 
government was put on hold indefinitely because state violence 
against our people still continues 
he cited excessive police force against protesters on monday 
that left at least nine blacks dead and more than 400 injured in 
sebokeng police said they opened fire after protesters stoned a 
police station in the township near johannesburg and set fire to 
municipal buildings 
if the government talks about negotiations on the one hand and 
massacres our people on the other hand we cannot tolerate that 
mandela said at a packed sports stadium in the southern city of 
bisho capital of the nominally independent ciskei homeland 
the conditions for the ancs armed struggle still prevail 
he added 
mandela said he acted on instructions from exiled anc leaders in 
lusaka zambia when he called de klerk on friday to tell him of 
the postponement 
he did not say what it would take to reschedule the talks which 
have been hailed as a groundbreaking effort to clear the way for 
extending political rights to the countrys 28 million black 
majority 
the cabinet minister for black affairs constitutional 
development minister gerrit viljoen said the whiteled government 
was giving attention to the announcements implications he did 
not elaborate 
de klerk said he was awaiting a full report on the violence but 
said the deaths should not be used to derail the proposed talks 
between black leaders and the government 
zach de beer coleader of the antiapartheid democratic party 
in the white chamber of parliament said the shooting at sebokeng 
was a deplorable episode but it can be no excuse for breaking 
off talks 
one can only express the heartfelt hope that the anc will 
think again and quickly de beer added 
anc officials and other antiapartheid leaders on friday 
persuaded mandela to back out of a planned appearance with 
political rival mangosuthu buthelezi leader of the zulu homeland 
the two had agreed on mandelas initiative to make a joint 
call for peace at a rally monday in natal province where fierce 
fighting between proanc and probuthelezi blacks has claimed at 
least 40 lives since tuesday thousand of blacks caught up in the 
violence have fled their homes 
mandela released from 27 years of imprisonment feb 11 is the 
effective head of the anc while president oliver tambo recovers 
from a stroke in sweden but events of the past two days suggest he 
may not have the freedom to pursue his initiatives without the 
approval of younger more militant anc leaders 
in lusaka the anc said it would hold a meeting within five days 
to review developments in south africa 
the organization the main black group fighting the government 
accused security forces of siding with buthelezis relatively 
conservative inkatha movement in the natal province factional 
fighting 
whereas in the past the regimes police turned a blind eye to 
vigilante terror directed at the democratic movement this week 
they have actually actively participated in the massacres the 
anc statement said 
mandela condemned the violence in natal and elsewhere but his 
appeals have had no impact several weeks ago he told blacks in 
natal to throw their weapons into the sea since then the 
faction fighting has only intensified 
supporters of the anc and buthelezis more conservative inkatha 
movement battled for political supremacy in natal since 1986 and 
at least 4000 blacks have been killed 
buthelezi expressed shock at mandelas decision not to attend a 
rally monday in the province 
people are going to die while they the anc delay said 
buthelezi who like mandela has made unheeded pleas for an end to 
the violence 
the government has made clear that the anc will be only one of 
several black groups that would be present for formal negotiations 
on a new constitution 
de klerk says he wants equal voting rights for all south 
africans but he opposes outright black majority rule and envisions 
a mechanism that will give the countrys 5 million whites veto 
power on major policy decisions 
the anc wants a oneperson onevote democracy

parade uniform staged an officially sanctioned march through 
downtown bucharest they passed makeshift candlelit shrines along 
the streets and in squares marking spots where some of the fiercest 
fighting took place 
the march started at a cathedral in front of parliament where 
services were held president ion iliescu and premier petre roman 
were there to join worshipers 
after leaving the prayer services some marchers walked to 
heroes cemetery at the outskirts of the capital where several 
hundred people killed in the fierce street battles between 
prodemocracy demonstrators and security agents are buried 
another group rallied in front of the television building that 
was a focal point of much of the fighting

abolition of the dictatorship was proclaimed and when democracy was 
installed said an editorial on the front page of saturdays 
edition of the tineretul liber daily newspaper

nicolae ceausescu first broke out in the western city of timisoara 
on dec 16 but soon spread to other parts of the country

capital where street fighting had broken out between secret police 
loyal to his regime and the army which sided with hundreds of 
thousands of demonstrators demanding an end to four decades of 
communist rule

executed on dec 25

honduras they would become part of the american dream 
in a strange and sometimes hostile city they clung to their own 
kind especially when it came time to party 
often they went to happy land an illegal bronx social club 
there a week ago an arson fire consumed the dream and the lives 
of 87 people

pedro and elida alvarez decided in 1986 that life in honduras no 
longer was tolerable they would emigrate first to the united 
states bringing their family with them as soon as they could 
they traveled first to los angeles but i didnt want to live 
there i already had relatives here and i wanted to be near my 
family mrs alvarez said they moved to new york and by 1988 
they had saved enough money to begin the process of reuniting their 
family 
we all came here looking for a good job to better ourselves 
our future alvarez said thats what we all thought wed come 
here and start a good life 
denny who had dropped out of a teacher education program in 
honduras would come first he would continue his studies here 
mrs alvarez hoped 
but when he arrived in march 1988 denny had other ideas 
when he got here he didnt want to study mrs alvarez said 
i would tell him not to go out at night but he would go 
alvarez sadly remembered last week as a son he was a good son 
but he would say he was young and he had his own life 
last october something happened that horrified the alvarez 
family denny got into a fight at happy land and was cut in the 
abdomen doctors stitched him up and he spent three days in the 
hospital 
in the aftermath of that incident dennys life became more 
tranquil three months ago he married a honduran woman he met

candy factory 
on saturday he dropped by his parents house and gave his 
mother a box of candy from his new job he then drove his mother to 
a friends house

friends said cousin hector martinez who had stopped going to 
happy land

brother carlos casco 21 
but marvin knew he couldnt continue to live in honduras he 
couldnt get a job he kept hearing that he could find work here

the car slowed on the rainslicked bronx street 
as its occupants pointed and stared at the charred building that 
once housed the happy land social club 
others stopped off friday night to add their contribution to a 
burgeoning memorial of flowers and funeral wreaths laid out on the 
sidewalk 
like a peculiar urban pilgrimage the scene is repeated over and 
over as friends and neighbors mourners and the merely curious come 
to see where 87 people died in last sundays fire at the illegal 
social club 
robert robayo and his wife estella somberly stood in the 
drizzle and stared blankly at charred coats that lay unclaimed 
behind the flowers 
i cant believe they had so many people in there it looks so 
small robayo said they should never have had so many people 
in there 
in the week since the disaster the city has cracked down on 
illegal social clubs beefing up enforcement by transferring more 
than 100 police officers from a special antidrug squad 
in raids thursday night and friday morning police found 74 of 
89 clubs they visited closed they served 17 summonses and 36 
notices for building and fire code infractions at 15 others 
at least four illegal clubs in the washington heights section of 
manhattan did not open this weekend because of the crackdown 
the four clubs said a source familiar with their operation who 
spoke on condition of anonymity usually buy just enough liquor for 
the weekend but opted not to buy any liquor or to open this weekend 
a woman stood outside what has become the citys bestknown 
club shaking her head as she recalled the numerous times she 
danced there safety never occurred to her 
youre in there drinking youre dancing youre not thinking 
about that said the woman who would identify herself only as 
celeste but now when i go to other clubs im going to look and 
see if they have a rear exit were it not for the small group of 
firefighters and police officers assigned to protect the building 
happy land might seem like just another charred building in the 
bronx the east tremont section where the building sits is bleak 
with littered vacant lots next to deteriorated buildings 
at the virgin islands american bar on east tremont a block from 
happy land several patrons said they had never previously heard of 
the club 
i couldnt even tell if the place was open or not said the 
bars manager who would identify herself only as shirley 
but a woman who visited the building insisted everyone in the 
area knew about happy land 
how could you not know about it it was like the only place 
you could go to around here and afford said the woman who would 
not give her name 
some are dropping off flowers others just stop and say a 
prayer said fire marshal larry lynch of the steady stream of 
visitors 
one onlooker asked if the neighborhood was returning to normal 
are you kidding this place is never normal this is the 
bronx answered a man who identified himself as alberto 
alberto who was walking around trying to sell two pairs of used 
trousers and slippers stared across the street at the happy land 
building 
look the drugs are still here people are still scared to go 
out in the street some of these young kids are crazy and will 
stick you for nothing no nothings changed here its just gone 
from bad to worse

voters decide this week whether to restrict 
wisconsins socalled vanna white veto which has allowed 
governors to rewrite legislation by striking letters words 
punctuation and numerals 
foes of the unlimited veto nicknamed for the letterflipping 
hostess on the television game show wheel of fortune say it 
gives legislative power to the executive branch violating the 
constitutional separation of powers 
this dictatorial power is clearly repugnant to the american 
constitutional system said senate president fred risser the 
intent of the legislature can be altered or reversed with a flick 
of the pen 
gov tommy g thompson a firstterm republican defends his 
courtaffirmed authority to selectively eliminate letters and is 
urging voters to retain it 
i think the people like having a strong governor thompson 
said adding hes the only person between the 132 lawmakers of a 
democratcontrolled legislature and their proposals for more 
spending and programs 
thompsons most famous vanna veto was when he reworked a 
bill in 1988 that limited the time a juvenile could be held in 
detention to 48 hours the governor boosted the limit to 10 days by 
crossing out 48 hours and most of the bills next four lines 
leaving intact only the word day and four other strategically 
placed letters ten days 
no attempt was made to override that veto even though it drew 
strong objections from legislators the governor said later he made 
a mistake in that case at the request of a couple of democratic 
legislators and quipped i followed the democrats advice and it 
got me in trouble but he has stuck to the concept of creative 
vetoing 
in another instance thompson used his pen to convert the 
legislatures 1 percent reduction in welfare spending to 6 percent 
thompsons aides say he has corrected language that would not 
have withstood legal challenges and inserted needed language such 
as definition of terms that was omitted inadvertently by 
legislators 
but the governors record 290 partial vetoes in the 198789 
state budget many of which changed appropriations bills by 
striking numbers and letters or merging words so angered 
democrats that they sued thompson 
in 1988 they lost in the state supreme court which cited the 
1930 provision in the state constitution giving the governor the 
right to veto any appropriation bill in part in its 43 
ruling the court interpreted in part to mean any part 
including lines paragraphs numerals letters and words 
their latest counterattack offers voters in tuesdays spring 
election a constitutional amendment that would bar the governor 
from using his veto to strike letters and words to change the 
meaning of legislation the governor could still strike numerals or 
entire sentences 
in wisconsin a constitutional amendment must be passed by two 
consecutive sessions of the legislature and then by voters in a 
statewide referendum 
rep david prosser the gop minority leader in the assembly 
tried unsuccessfully to sidetrack the amendment in the legislature 
he contends the governor needs the authority to correct legislative 
mistakes 
prosser claims the furor over the governors use of the veto is 
overblown because the legislature has the right to restore bills to 
their original form by overriding a veto with a twothirds vote of 
both houses 
democrats control the senate 1914 and the assembly 5542 but 
often they cannot muster enough votes among republicans to override 
thompson 
still no lawmaker has seriously suggested that the partial veto 
power be repealed just tamed 
the issue has created friction between the legislative and

prosecutors in the criminal trial of john 
poindexter tried to make it appear the former national security 
adviser was immersed in a pattern of deception that kept even his 
own boss ronald reagan in the dark 
but defense attorneys suggested that poindexter himself was 
uninformed about onetime white house aide oliver norths activities 
on behalf of the contras and the sale of arms to iran they 
questioned the accuracy of an fbi agents testimony and elicited 
testimony from witnesses who swore there was never any discussion 
of covering up 
poindexter who didnt testify is on trial in us district 
court in washington on charges that he lied to members of congress 
about his involvement in selling arms to iran and funneling 
proceeds to help nicaraguan rebels when congress had banned such 
aid 
the arms sales supposedly were intended to make it possible to 
release american hostages held in the middle east even though the 
official policy was not to negotiate with terrorists 
district judge harold greene was scheduled to instruct the jury 
monday after which deliberations will begin 
during the trial which began march 5 prosecutors contended 
poindexter withheld the truth from reagan about the diversion of 
arms sale money to the contras 
according to a defense witness who took notes at a meeting on 
oct 7 1986 between poindexter and reagan poindexter told the 
president there was no us government connection to a downed 
aircraft in nicaragua 
the plane shot down two days before carried crewman eugene 
hasenfus who was part of norths resupply effort to the contra 
rebels fighting the nicaraguan government 
poindexters lawyers brought up the meeting as part of the 
effort to show that north ran the operation without the knowledge 
of his immediate boss poindexter but prosecutor dan k webb 
suggested poindexter knew hasenfus was a pilot with the supply 
effort just as poindexter was fully informed of the previous 
armsforhostages effort 
north has already been convicted for his role in the affair 
poindexter is accused only of falsely telling congress on nov 
21 1986 that he hadnt known until january of that year that us 
hawk missiles were airlifted to iran late in the previous year 
prosecutors presented evidence of poindexters involvement in 
the november 1985 missile shipment including 
computer messages from north discussing the impending delivery 
of the hawks poindexters lawyers point out there is no evidence 
that he read the messages 
cia employee norman gardners statements to the fbi in 1987 
that cia cable traffic showed the operation was being directed on 
instructions from poindexter at poindexters trial gardner said 
he didnt recall telling that to the fbi 
on nov 28 1986 poindexter had told the fbi he had no 
working knowledge of 1985 arms shipments to iran an fbi agent 
testified poindexters lawyers countered by pointing out that the 
fbi agent had taken no notes during the 15minute interview she 
wrote down notes on her way back to the office 
poindexter contacted the pentagon to line up replacement hawks 
for the ones israel was preparing to send iran on behalf of the 
united states 
poindexter received a nov 26 1985 note from cia director 
casey telling him to keep an attached draft of a presidential 
document secret the presidential document allowed the cia to help 
with the missile shipment the day before 
such a document known as a finding was signed by the 
president the next month in a speech late the next year nov 13 
1986 reagan said the united states had not sold arms to win 
release of the hostages 
on nov 21 1986 poindexter told congress that he hadnt known 
until the previous day that some us officials might have known 
before the delivery that hawks were aboard an aircraft 
casey told congress the same day he understood cia officers 
didnt know hawk missiles were aboard the aircraft until the 
iranians told them some time in january 1986 the airplanes 
crew casey testified had been told the cargo was spare parts for 
the oil drilling fields in tehran 
hours after briefing congress poindexter tore up the 
politically embarrassing presidential document 
cia aide gardner said he sat in on poindexters briefings of 
congressmen after casey told me to go to the white house after 
casey finished testifying before the senate intelligence committee 
gardner reported caseys testimony back to poindexter at the white 
house 
was gardner there to make sure admiral poindexter and casey 
were saying the same things to congress inquired irancontra 
prosecutor christian mixter 
no replied gardner who stiffly denied casey and poindexter 
were feeding congress a cover story 
did you tell admiral poindexter that the cover story wasnt 
holding up very well asked mixter 
no i didnt replied gardner 
poindexters defense is that at the time he briefed congress he 
had only a vague recollection of the yearearlier shipment to iran 
poindexter offered to gather details and get back to the 
congressmen his lawyers emphasized in questioning witnesses who 
attended the meetings

republicans have a hard time winning anything in 
hawaii even a cockroach race 
undaunted by two previous defeats president bush is hoping a 
kinder gentler cockroach will reverse his fortunes in the iolani 
schools annual roach race 
the white house has lost in the past with entries named the 
yellow roach of texas and oval office roach but bush has 
high hopes for a bug named kinder gentleroach 
bush figures if the slogan was good enough to beat michael 
dukakis it should be good enough to win the april 20 race 
i know a lot of thoroughbred roach lovers were disappointed 
that oval office roach did so badly back in 1988 but lots has 
happened since then bush wrote in a letter to roach race founder 
kimo mcvay 
bush challenged the other competitors to submit their roaches to 
tests for illegal chemicals saying he would submit his roach to 
an antisteroid test saliva test etc and i challenge all other 
roach owners to do the same 
the president also joked about the entry of race commissioner 
william conrad of tvs jake and the fatman fame saying 
conrads roach would not win because its overweight 
money from the event goes to help fight multiple sclerosis a 
disease of the central nervous system that afflicts an estimated 
250000 americans

flexing its military muscle the kremlin blusters 
at lithuanias leaders for boldly declaring independence yet it 
hardly uttered a critical word when estonia issued a cautious 
statement of similar intent 
the two republics forcibly annexed by moscow in 1940 with the 
third baltic state of latvia are treading very different paths in 
their quest for secession 
lithuanians demand recognition now and want to work out the 
details later estonians want to know exactly what theyre getting 
into 
watching and waiting are latvia georgia moldavia and other 
soviet republics where yearnings to leave the soviet union are also 
strong 
on friday when soviet soldiers were seizing the lithuanian 
prosecutors office in an effort to impose moscows man estonias 
legislature was declaring the soviets occupiers and setting off on 
the road to restored sovereignty 
the reaction of moscow has been as different as the tactical 
divergence in the baltic independence movement that surfaced in 
1988 
soviet military officials accuse lithuanias leaders of plotting 
to jail opponents of secession and of encouraging lithuanians to 
desert the red army president mikhail s gorbachev has accused 
them of pursuing a ruinous road 
in contrast the soviet communist party daily pravda on saturday 
noted that even estonian radicals say first negotiations and 
then a political decision 
the three baltic states snatched independence from the ruins of 
the russian empire at the end of world war i were forcibly 
absorbed back into the soviet union in 1940 and spent most of world 
war ii under nazi occupation 
thousands of baltic people were then exiled to siberia or killed 
by stalin as alleged nazi collaborators or enemies of soviet power 
armed resistance to soviet rule lasted well into the 1950s in 
lithuanian forests 
latvia is moving more slowly than its neighbors because its 
population is only about half ethnic latvian but lithuanian and 
estonian leaders say they hope it also will make a first formal 
move toward independence despite tactical differences activists 
from the three republics cooperate closely 
lithuanias premier kazimiera prunskiene called estonias move 
friday a show of support for her republic but said she did not 
know whether it would help or hurt 
president vytautas landsbergis of lithuania said estonia has 
chosen a different legal formula and a different path toward its 
independence but the essence is the same 
the march 11 declaration of independence by lithuanias 
parliament was a hasty move aimed at preempting gorbachev from 
using newly expanded presidential powers to dissolve their 
parliament or impose direct kremlin rule but immediately after the 
declaration nothing really changed lithuanians still used soviet 
money and still were working in factories tied by contract and 
supply to the soviet economy 
the legislature elected last month then began removing the 
trappings of soviet rule named cabinet ministers and began 
developing its own body of laws 
moscow cracked down soviet troops raided hospitals to seize 
lithuanians who asserting their claim to be foreign citizens 
deserted the red army kremlin forces also took over several 
communist party buildings 
after failing friday to get employees of the prosecutors office 
in the lithuanian capital of vilnius to accept a new chief 
appointed by moscow soviet officials sent soldiers to occupy the 
office 
efforts to disarm the population and halt a lithuanian campaign 
to sign up volunteers for duty as borders guards were less 
effective 
it is just those kinds of disputes the estonians say they want 
to avoid 
in its declaration friday the estonian parliament said full 
independence would be established only after estonia creates its 
own institutions and works out how to divide property between the 
republic and the soviet union 
the length of the transition period is to be set this week 
compared with lithuanias rush for political high ground 
estonia seems unconcerned about the possibility of gorbachev 
slamming the door before it can escape the soviet union 
the republics leaders say there is no point in declaring 
independence because estonia has been independent though occupied 
all along 
official soviet communications about estonias future seem to 
carry an air of resignation tass the official soviet news agency 
said the broad aspiration to restore estonian statehood is in 
evidence and that political parties that want to pursue it appear 
to have the upper hand 
ethnic lithuanians comprise about 80 percent of their republics 
38 million people by contrast ethnic estonians make up just 60 
percent of their republics 16 million people and must thus move 
more cautiously they lack the twothirds majority needed for 
independence if it were put to a referendum 
the population split also has given nonestonians a greater 
share of the supreme soviets 105 seats but as fridays 750 vote 
showed they do not have enough to stop the legislature from moving 
toward independence 
pravdas commentary saturday praised estonian communist party 
leader vaino vyalyas an old chum of gorbachevs from the komsomol 
communist youth league for keeping estonia under control 
vyalyas it said is a man with great political experience a 
professional diplomat who is familiar with the fine art of 
compromise thanks to which in the last year and a half the 
republic has managed to smooth over many difficult problems

robert palmisciano bet 2 at a greyhound 
track and won 39319 but had to wait more than five years for the 
payoff 
a state superior court jury ruled in his favor friday in a 
lawsuit against lincoln greyhound park 
palmisciano placed his bet on a twin trifecta meaning he had to 
pick the win place and show dogs in two races at a meet on dec 
10 1984 
after getting the 9th race right he went to a teller to choose 
three more dogs for the 11th race but after making his selection 
he changed his mind and told the teller he wanted to bet on three 
other dogs 
the teller started to give him another ticket but the machine 
jammed before a maintenance man could fix it the 11th race had 
started 
the dogs again came in as palmisciano predicted but the 
racetrack refused to pay him a 39319 jackpot because he didnt 
have a ticket 
palmisciano claimed autotote limited which operates the tote 
machines at the track was negligent for failing to have additional 
service personnel while the race program was under way 
he also claimed that track officials did not comply with its 
obligation under an implied betting contract between him and 
lincoln greyhound park 
his attorney john d archetto said the jury award plus 
interest is expected to exceed 60000

walter weigel has no plans to 
visit the mass grave on the edge of town that has drawn the eerie 
fascination of so many of his neighbors 
i am certain i knew some of the people buried there said 
the native of oranienburg 20 miles north of berlin 
weigel 62 spent four years after world war ii in a nearby 
sovietrun internment camp he said he believes the camp supplied 
the hundreds of bodies packed together in the nearby forest 
there were youngsters in the camp here not just soldiers i 
was 17 a worker not a soldier he said saturday they gave us 
only bread to eat two hundred and fifty men in one barracks 
weigel said many of his fellow inmates were taken from the camp 
and never returned we knew what happened to them he said 
staring down the road that leads to the forest 
a steady stream of visitors filtered through the forest on the 
outskirts of town on saturday standing in the clearing and staring 
at the dozens of holes dug by authorities then refilled with loose 
dirt 
my parents told me this had happened but nobody really talked 
about it now we can see it said luther walz an oranienburg 
resident who trekked into the forest with his wife and son 
last week officials began digging in the woods after a resident 
said that as a young boy he watched soviet troops gun down hundreds 
of german prisoners soon after the end of the war 
the skeletal remains of between 200 and 1000 people were 
unearthed during the excavations 
oranienburg authorities said they could not identify the dead 
but presumed they were german inmates of the camp that they said 
was run by stalins fearsome secret police 
west german officials have said about 70000 germans were 
executed by stalins occupation troops in the years following the 
war many of the soviet internment camps were former nazi death 
camps 
the discovery of the remains has triggered considerable interest 
in both west germany and east germany but little attention in 
other parts of the world where the deaths of 6 million jews at the 
hands of the nazis dwarfs all other atrocities of the war 
in this village however the grave site has provoked 
fascination 
the 300yard gravesite is blockedoff by a thin white rope 
draped with small redandwhite flags mass grave of unknown 
victims entry forbidden says the widely ignored sign at the end 
of the clearing 
nearby a new wooden cross with the name adolf lopoehn had 
been stuck in the ground it identified lopoehn as a singer from 
the nearby town of sachsenhausen 
there were children there said gertrude erdmann 76 
they are nazis said an elderly man who refused to give his 
name

president mikhail s gorbachev told 
lithuanians on saturday that moscow would not negotiate with them 
until they annul their declaration of independence warning of 
grave consequences if they refuse 
in vilnius lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis dismissed 
the appeal telling reporters the soviet leader was demanding 
impossible things 
in a toughly worded 18line statement issued in moscow and 
addressed to the republics parliament gorbachev charged 
lithuanian leaders with openly challenging and insulting the 
soviet union 
gorbachev said lithuania had chosen a ruinous path that 
will only lead to a dead end 
it was his first formal statement on the issue since march 11 
when the baltic states parliament sparked open confrontation with 
the kremlin by voting to secede from the soviet union 
gorbachev said he was proposing that lithuanias parliament 
immediately annul the illegal acts it has adopted such a step 
will open the possibility for discussing the entire range of 
problems on the solely acceptable basis within the framework of 
the ussr constitution 
in a separate threepage statement also carried by the official 
tass news agency and read by an announcer on national television 
news saturday night gorbachev addressed the people of lithuania 
directly 
he warned that irresponsible and illegal actions by 
lithuanian leaders could affect the republics economic 
scientific technical and other links with soviet republics which 
supply the baltic state with much of its oil gas and other 
essential products 
in vilnius uniformed men were reported patrolling the printing 
plant for republics main newspapers and the chief prosecutors 
office both buildings were seized during the night in moscows 
latest move to assert control 
the lithuanians have not budged and landsbergis said they would 
press on with their independence drive 
we have no sources for stopping this we can work live 
normally and wait we must be tough and have tenacity we have this 
in our character 
in an attempt to pressure lithuania to back down soviet troops 
have occupied communist party buildings paraded tanks through the 
streets demanded that residents hand over firearms and arrested 
lithuanian deserters from the red army 
gorbachev said the kremlin was receiving many letters and 
telegrams from citizens demanding that the soviet government uphold 
the constitution in its showdown with lithuania 
the situation in the republic and around it has become 
dramatic if you would not hear the voice of the reason now the 
developments may have grave consequences for all of us we must be 
united in our desire to prevent that 
lithuanias deputy premier romualdas ozolas said gorbachevs 
appeal was strong its a step we must overcome he suggested 
lithuanians write to the kremlin to express their desire for 
independence 
gorbachev acted after his newly created cabinet directed him 
friday to tell lithuania that it must rescind unconstitutional laws 
before any talks on secession could begin the constitution 
stipulates a republics right to secede but offers no mechanism for 
secession 
gorbachev has promised lithuania and other independenceminded 
republics that such a mechanism will be established but the 
measure currently before the soviet legislature gives the kremlin 
final authority on such questions 
on friday nearby estonia pledged to join lithuania in its drive 
to regain independence lost when the soviet union forcibly annexed 
them with latvia the third baltic republic latvia is expected to 
pursue independence next month 
in moscow earlier saturday about 700 people rallied in gorky 
park in support of lithuania carrying signs that read hands off 
lithuania and down with red fascism 
official soviet sources estimate about 250 lithuanians have 
deserted the red army since the republic declared independence but 
lithuanians say as many as 900 have left their units 
the soviet militarys deputy commander in lithuania n 
rogachev told tass saturday that lithuanian deserters were 
beginning to trickle back to barracks the military rounded up at 
least 23 deserters on tuesday beating some bloody and promised to 
seek out others who do not turn themselves in 
sooner or later the law will be put into force rogachev 
warned and the consequences for the fates of the young people 
may be most tragic 
the defense ministry had said it would not punish lithuanian 
deserters if they voluntarily returned 
but chief military prosecutor alexander katusev said in a later 
interview on soviet tv that criminal proceedings had been started 
against all deserters and added that people encouraging desertions 
also would be prosecuted 
vilius kavalauskas a journalist for the lithuanian newspaper 
tiesa said 30 soldiers were patrolling the prosecutors office and 
another 15 armed with nightsticks were at the central newspaper 
printing plant 
lithuanian journalists said soldiers had not tried to interfere 
with printing of weekend papers 
the prosecutors office was seized friday after staff members 
refused to work with a moscow loyalist named by the kremlin 
a duty officer at the lithuanian interior ministry said soldiers 
also had occupied another communist party building the institute 
of party history communist party buildings already under military 
control include the institute of marxismleninism the higher party 
school and communist party headquarters 
soviet authorities have said the troop actions were legitimate 
attempts to enforce law and order in a soviet republic that has no 
right to unilaterally declare independence

nomination of a onetime drug user as the 
nations top savings and loan regulator demonstrates president 
bushs unwillingness to adopt past drug usage as a litmus test for 
officials in his administration officials said saturday 
these matters are always considered on a case by case basis 
one white house official said saturday when asked about nominee t 
timothy ryans admission that he had used cocaine and marijuana on 
occasion in the early 1970s 
the president himself has said past indiscretions with drugs 
should not disqualify someone from government service 
in my view if somebody used marijuana sometime ago and is 
not into anything of that nature why no i dont think that 
should be held against them he said when asked in midmarch 
about campaign reports regarding texas state treasurer ann 
richards refusal to say whether she had ever used illegal 
narcotics the gubernatorial candidate has admitted to being a 
recovering alcoholic 
ryan bushs embattled nominee to be director of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision won narrow endorsement 
friday from the senate banking committee despite the disclosure of 
drug use 
the committee members had access to fbi background reports in 
which ryan admitted the drug use but the matter was never raised 
during the committees hearings despite considerable opposition to 
his appointment 
one banking committee member sen bob graham dfla knew 
about the drug use on the part of ryan prior to the vote said aide 
ken klein but klein said grahams primary interest was 
qualifications indicating that the senator didnt think ryan had 
the necessary experience 
committee chairman donald riegle dmich who also opposed 
ryan released a statement saying fbi files should be treated 
with the strictest confidentiality i will not comment on any 
nominees file i consider any disclosures from such files to be 
highly improper 
the drug information was disclosed in an nbctv report friday 
night and later confirmed by administration officials 
officials expressed support for ryan after the disclosure 
stressing the administration had known the information all along 
we knew about it before hand we felt it was not relevant we 
felt he was the best candidate white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said saturday 
treasury secretary nicholas brady emphasized in a statement 
friday that ryan had volunteered the information 
the incidents were limited and a long time ago brady said 
we believe mr ryan is well qualified and his nomination deserves 
the senates full support 
if confirmed by the senate the 44yearold ryan would not be 
alone as a former drug user in the bush administration said 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
one said it would be safe to say there are hundreds of 
officials throughout the administration who have admitted to drug 
use in their security clearance process 
another senior official said it would be impossible to 
conceive there are not numerous individuals who like ryan 
experimented with drugs in the 1970s when many considered marijuana 
use and even cocaine more benign than in todays antidrug climate 
everybodys off that stuff now said a third official but 
broadly speaking everybody used the stuff in the 70s the bush 
administration is aware of that usage because nobody wants to lie 
to the fbi the source added 
the seriousness of the drug use the type of drugs used and how 
long ago it occurred are factors to be considered when looking at 
how much to weigh past drug abuse against a potential nominees 
record officials said 
even some diehard conservatives in washington political circles 
do not see drug use as a flat disqualifier for public office 
gary bauer who served as domestic policy adviser under 
president reagan and now heads the conservative family research 
council said saturday that theres a statute of limitations on 
every indiscretion as serious as drug use is id being willing to 
concede that 20 years is a good statute of limitations 
however he said ryan as a condition of his confirmation 
should pledge to devote a specific number of hours a week to talk 
to young people about the foolishness of what he did and how it 
almost ruined his life 
to do otherwise would send a message of hypocrisy to children 
bauer said 
we are spending billions of dollars on this problem we 
shouldnt be telling our kids dont and then appointing 
officials to high government positions unless they take on the 
antidrug education task he suggests bauer said 
in 1987 during the reagan administration douglas ginsburg 
withdrew as a nominee to the supreme court after admitting he had 
smoked marijuana while a law professor william bennett then the 
education secretary and now bushs drug policy director helped 
persuade ginsburg to withdraw 
but politicians appear more willing to count on public 
understanding of their past drug use at least in cases that did 
not amount to a prolonged period of serious abuse 
during the early days prior to the 1988 presidential campaign 
democratic contenders bruce babbitt the former arizona governor 
and sen albert gore jr of tennessee both admitted they had 
smoked marijuana while in college 
bush said he had never tried illegal drugs himself but added at 
that time but id hate to speak for my kids 
bushs five children range in age from 30 to 43

abortion foes quickly targeted democratic 
gov cecil andrus for defeat in his try for an unprecedented fourth 
term saying he betrayed his own beliefs by vetoing what would have 
been the nations most restrictive state abortion law 
this veto will galvanize the prolife majority in idaho and 
nationwide said national right to life president john willke 
maintaining andrus has forfeited any claim to an antiabortion 
stand 
we will be heard at the polls vowed kerry uhlenkott of 
idaho right to life this has been a long hard fight and it is 
by no means over 
andrus acknowledging the political cost of his veto said he 
acted in the best interests of his state he denied being 
influenced by political considerations and threats of economic 
retaliation from outsiders 
instead andrus said he rejected a bill that many legal experts 
said had little chance of being upheld 
i know that of course there will be some fallout but so be 
it andrus said i cant do anything about that i have to do 
what i think is right 
while incurring the wrath of antiabortion activists andrus did 
win over prochoice forces who pledged to support him despite his 
belief that abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape 
incest and to save the womens life 
one of the main architects of the vetoed bill rep gary 
montgomery conceded the legislation could have been improved and 
strengthened he and other abortion foes promised to refine and 
reintroduce the bill in 1991 
the defeated version based on a national right to life 
committee model rejected as too restrictive by other states called 
for outlawing abortion except in cases of nonstatutory rape 
reported within seven days incest if the victim is under 18 
severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or physical health 
of the woman 
the legislature adjourned its 1990 session a half hour before 
the governors announcement on friday precluding the possibility 
of even considering an override of the veto 
this is a time for reflection to solicit the views of our 
constituents over the interim period montgomery said 
idaho was the fifth state this year to reject a form of the 
national model antiabortion forces want to use to test the us 
supreme courts commitment to legalized abortion 
kate michelman president of the national abortion rights action 
league called the andrus veto an outstanding victory 
but we face the reality that for every cecil andrus there 
stands a bob casey and a joseph ada ready to take away the right of 
women to choose so our work is not done michelman said she 
referred to the pennsylvania and guam governors who signed 
restrictive abortion legislation 
it only takes one piece of antichoice legislation to be 
passed in one state somewhere in this country to threaten all 
womens rights she said until we have prochoice governors 
prochoice legislatures a prochoice congress a prochoice 
president in washington our job is not done 
with some politicians believing the veto has complicated what 
would have been easy reelection the three republicans competing 
for the right to challenge andrus this fall immediately accused the 
governor of waffling on abortion 
boise stockbroker milton erhart the lone gop contender on the 
prochoice side pointed out that 17 years ago andrus was the 
governor who signed the socalled trigger law banning abortion 
except to save the womans life and to imprison both women and 
doctors involved in illegal abortions if the supreme court reversed 
its 1973 decision 
the legislature repealed that law this year andrus has again 
demonstrated his expert fingerinthewind approach to politics 
erhart said 
former state sen roger fairchild said andrus should win an 
olympic gold medal in the flipflop and state sen rachel gilbert 
considered the frontrunner for the nomination said andrus went 
south on his principles 
andrus insisting he remains opposed to abortion maintained the 
majority of idahoans would agree with his decision 
every political career has to come to an end sometime he 
said id hate for that to be the issue but if it is so be it

in indiana where time zones can divide a 
town many people keep two reckonings of the hour to cope with 
living in a time warp 
hoosiers say the states three time zones wreak havoc on 
business and family life at no time does the entire state follow 
the same clock creating timekeeping headaches from urban centers 
to country hamlets 
people live in one zone and work in another children cross time 
lines to and from school prime time programming for televison is 
complicated and meetings can be disrupted by delays latecomers and 
noshows 
one of three states exempted from the national time change the 
others are hawaii and arizona indiana is the only one with 
fragmented zones a large portion is permanently on eastern 
standard time while the rest observes either central time or 
eastern time and changes twice a year like the other 47 states 
indiana has the most complex time observance of any place in 
the united states said joanne petrie an attorney for the us 
department of transportation the agency in charge of setting time 
zones 
mayor john ford of union city which is divided down the middle 
by the indianaohio line calls sundays change to daylightsaving 
time a time warp 
he said most residents of the portion of union city in indiana 
will experience the anxiety of being an hour late for something as 
those on the ohio side of the line spring ahead but theyll make 
it up by being an hour early for something else he said 
the majority of people live the way it suits them and in a 
lot of places that involves keeping two different times in the same 
househould he said 
seventysix of indianas 92 counties including randolph 
county in which union city ind is located remain on eastern 
standard time as everyone else resets their clocks on sunday 
eleven other counties observe central time and on schedule 
switch from cst to cdt as of sunday meaning that for the next 
five months their clocks will look just like the est counties 
clocks five other counties that are close to louisville or 
cincinnati traditionally observe eastern time to remain in step 
with those cities switching as of sunday to edt 
indianas time zones are a compromise following years of local 
and national debate officials say its probably the best that can 
be expected though far from perfect 
prior to 1961 the indianaohio line also divided the central 
and eastern time zones the line was later shifted to bisect the 
state and then reshifted to create current time boundaries 
theres some sort of truce right now said chuck coffee a 
speechwriter for lt gov frank obannon it was much different 
when the population was dependent on rail service and waited as 
trains came to town he said 
indiana balks at joining with the rest of the eastern time zone 
in observing daylight saving time officials say because it lies 
on the western edge of the zone and already has a relatively late 
sunrise daylight saving time would exacerbate that much to the 
displeasure of farmers who relish the early daylight hours for 
field work 
simply going on central time is opposed by many others who feel 
indiana is more attuned to new york and eastern cities and changing 
would put it out of step the entire year 
why would someone think that they are traveling within the 
same state and the times going to change said carolyn 
mcclintock vanderburgh county commissioner

the head of the national organization for 
women on saturday praised idaho gov cecil andrus veto of a 
restrictive abortion bill but said she didnt know what influence 
a threatened boycott of idaho potatoes had on him 
how much effect the threat of a boycott had i havent the 
vaguest idea but he certainly did in my opinion the right 
thing now president molly yard told reporters 
ms yard attending nows northeast regional conference said 
pleas from teenagers letters and telegrams from prochoice forces 
and calls from other governors opposed to the idaho legislation 
probably helped influence andrus 
i think that gov andrus thought very very carefully about 
what he was doing and i think there are many reasons that went 
into his decision which was obviously done with care ms yard 
said 
he clearly did talk to the medical profession and the legal 
profession he was advised by the latter that the bill was 
unconstitutional and he was advised by the former that women would 
virtually be banned from having abortions she said i think 
that troubled him 
ms yard rejected the suggestion that nows threatened boycott 
would have been unfair to idaho potato growers who had nothing to 
do with the abortion bill nine of the idaho lawmakers who voted on 
the bill were potato growers she said 
the onus is on them ms yard said they brought it on 
themselves 
ms yard went to the weekend conference prepared to make a pitch 
for maine potatoes but andrus announced his veto friday night of 
what would have become the most restrictive abortion law in the 
united states had he signed it 
i listened to his statement last night ms yard said it 
is the first time ive ever heard a man say exactly what i feel 
about expecting any woman to carry her pregnancy to term if shes 
been raped or shes pregnant because of incest and he said it 
eloquently 
im sure lots of men feel that way its the first time ive 
ever heard a man say it out loud 
despite fridays victory for prochoice groups ms yard said 
activists still face tough fights over abortion rights in florida 
illinois amd other states

a previously unknown group claimed 
responsibility saturday for the shooting of a polish diplomat and 
his wife warning poland not to help soviet jews travel to israel 
the shootings friday night came less than a week after poland 
offered to help soviet jews emigrate to israel palestinian 
extremists have threatened attacks against countries that assist in 
the migration 
the claim of responsibility came in a handwritten arabic 
statement from the revolutionary action organization the arab 
resistance frontthe martyr suleiman alhalabi unit published by 
the leftist beirut newspaper assafir 
our group is behind the polish diplomats operation we warn 
the polish government against providing any assistance in 
transporting soviet jews to our sacred land in palestine the 
statement said 
the pole his countrys commercial attache and his lebanese 
wife were wounded by assailants with automatic rifles who fired at 
them as they were parking their embassy car near the bristol hotel 
in moslem west beirut 
they were rushed to the american university hospital where 
doctors said they were off the critical list 
the polish official was first identified by police as bugdan 
zbigniew 47 and his wife as eva sarkis the hospital said he was 
registered as bogdan sarkis the official polish news agency pap 
identified the couple as bogdan and eva sarka 
a man who answered the phone in the wounded officials hospital 
room and identified himself only as a friend refused to give the 
poles last name saying he was in danger he said the name 
zbigniew was not correct 
a hospital medical bulletin said the pole had a bullet wound in 
the chest and his wife suffered minor wounds in the left arm 
the polish government condemned the attack and said it was 
taking increased measures to protect diplomats and other overseas 
employees 
in a dispatch from warsaw pap said the foreign ministry 
strongly condemns this terrorist act poland will undertake 
all efforts to counteract terrorism abroad 
polands prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki offered transport 
to israelbound soviet jews after hungarys malev airline stopped 
charters and some scheduled flights to israel because of threats 
from palestinian extremists 
malev later resumed scheduled flights but said it would not 
reinstate the charters the airline also discontinued its flights 
to beirut on tuesday 
its officials had said malev received a bomb threat from the 
lebanonbased islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
many arabs fear the influx of soviet jews in israel and the 
occupied territories will displace palestinians and strengthen 
israels grip on the west bank and gaza strip 
polands foreign ministry had said it was aware that a decision 
to transport soviet jews to israel in polish airliners might have 
adverse effects for poland the polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza 
reported this week the ministry feared attacks on the 10000 poles 
employed in arab countries

us trade negotiators said saturday they were 
close to an agreement with the japan over removing barriers to the 
sale of usmade satellites in that country 
the officials said the agreement could be completed as early as 
monday 
it would mark the second success in a 10month negotiating 
effort being conducted under the threat of economic retaliation by 
the us against japan 
a week ago negotiators announced the first breakthrough in the 
talks an agreement to expand sales of us supercomputers in 
japan a us trade official who spoke on condition his name not 
be used said saturday that only one technical issue remained to be 
resolved in the satellite talks 
he said that the japanese had agreed to american demands to 
allow us satellite manufacturers to compete on an equal footing 
with japanese companies on satellite projects being sponsored by 
the japanese government 
only two weeks ago us negotiators were expressing dismay with 
what they considered the unwillingness of the japanese to make 
concessions on the satellite issue 
however when the japanese team arrived thursday to resume 
talks there were reports they were bringing new proposals that 
would meet american demands 
satellites and supercomputers are two of the products singled 
out last may by the bush administration as areas where the japanese 
had erected unfair barriers to the sale of american goods 
with the resolution of these two issues only lumber products 
remain in dispute in the socalled super 301 negotiations 
while negotiators have reported some success at narrowing the 
differences the american side is still not satisfied with the 
access being offered by the japanese to their market for lumber 
products 
further talks in the lumber area are scheduled for later in 
april the japanese have been negotiating against a june 16 
deadline 
the bush administration is empowered under the 1988 trade act to 
raise tariffs on japanese products if japan refuses to open markets

the soviet union in an effort to stop smuggling 
that has left store shelves bare throughout the country has 
announced that soviet tourists will be forbidden from taking most 
consumer goods abroad 
the list of banned goods seems endless soviet tourists are now 
barred from leaving the country with everything ranging from car 
batteries to tires mushrooms caviar electric wire bicycles 
cooking oil fabrics and nearly all food products 
valery draganov deputy head of the customs authority announced 
the clampdown on exports friday evening and said it was made 
necessary by chronic shortages of consumer supplies throughout the 
soviet union 
these are extraordinary emergency measures needed to 
stabilize the consumer market he said 
he said the restrictions would not apply to purchases made in 
soviet hardcurrency stores which do not accept rubles and 
generally cater to foreigners or to companies authorized to 
conduct international trade 
the move seems designed to appeal to soviet shoppers who often 
spend hours standing in line outside stores with meager supplies 
but for soviets who travel abroad the announcement was 
devastating 
soviets are only permitted to leave the country with the 
equivalent of 30 to 200 dollars depending on the length and type 
of trip 
to save money many soviets bring food with them while others 
take along expensive consumer items to pick up spare cash soviet 
goods are generally cheaper than their western counterparts 
although they are usually of a lower quality 
draganov said the new restrictions will last throughout 1990 
the consumer market is becoming more and more naked he 
said the situation is becoming even more complex since we 
witness an increased activity of mafia groups 
he said underground groups have been known to purchase large 
shipments of consumer goods from factories and ship them out of the 
country before they reach soviet stores 
we had to stop this mass export of commodities immediately 
draganov said 
at chop a border crossing station in the western ukraine 
customs officials recently confiscated 200 sets of linens 20 
bicycles and six gasolinepowered saws from soviet tourists 
dragonov said tourists were trying to bring out virtually 
everything one can think of 
he said they also have been caught at border crossings smuggling 
cheeses buckets mousetraps electric irons toys socks and 
metalwork equipment 
notice that these goods disappear very quickly from the 
shelves of our shops he said 
the smuggling tourists are not only soviets national television 
recently showed a huge warehouse filled with tv sets and other 
goods it said were confiscated from polish tourists

cable televisions free ride is over and 
consumer complaints and runaway rates will bring the pay tv 
industry under increased government regulation the nations 
broadcasters were told satuday 
we began the 1980s with cable an infant industry crying for 
special privilege just to survive edward o fritts president of 
the national association of broadcasters said in his state of 
the industry address 
cable is multiplying faster than radio formats fritts said 
calling for congress and the federal communications commission to 
restore enough balance to the competitive forces to let consumers 
decide how much programming they want for free 
the nab fighting cables encroachment into the lucrative tv 
business is backing moves to put cabletv monopolies under 
increased regulatory control legislation cracking down on the 
cable companies should pass in this session of congress said sen 
ernest fritz hollings dsc chairman of the senate commerce 
science and transportation committee 
the service is sorry and the rates are horrendous hollings 
said we find thats the case all over the country 
legislative efforts are under way to allow price controls in 
areas where cable companies have monopolies and to enable 
communities to better ride herd on the service the companies 
provide 
congress should not and will not regulate cable tv 
programming but cracking down on service and prices is another 
matter hollings said i think well get that passed this year 
he said 
congress is likely to restore the mustcarry provision 
requiring cable companies to carry local tv broadcasting hollings 
predicted 
hollings said he personally is the victim of his local cable 
company at his home on the isle of palms where hurricane hugo 
slammed ashore last september 
the hurricane hit us on sept 21 hollings said someday 
i hope to get back cable 
hollings said that by the turn of the century more than half 
the tv watchers in america will be paying for the privilege 
we call your industry mature he told the broadcasters 
that means youre not going to get much growth 
but he discounted the notion the government might ever help 
people pay their tv bills no matter how ubiquitous pay services 
become ive heard were going to have broadcast stamps like food 
stamps he said this countrys gone crazy in a lot of 
respects but not that crazy 
the nab is seeking government help in saving am radio whose 
audience has largely left for bettersounding fm 
fritts called for the government to clear up frequency and 
transmission questions clearing the way for an am stereo 
renaissance 
it is clear he said that the am band must have the 
improvement that nab has requested 
free overtheair broadcasting is being repeated like a 
mantra this weekend while some 50000 broadcasters and exhibitors 
ponder the future of the industry 
there are many prophets with a pitch who glibly assure us that 
broadcasting is in its twilight years fritts said they are 
wrong 
he hailed the powerful presence of the broadcast media in 
fueling democratic revolutions across europe the equivalent of 
revolutionaryera printing in this country 
radio and tv he said are the modern manifestation of the 
free media that has served our people so well

the fraud indictment of floridas 
biggest land developer has prompted state business regulators to 
investigate the states handsoff handling of the troubled general 
development corp 
the miamibased land developer pleaded guilty in federal court 
last month to mailfraud conspiracy for misleading customers and 
overpricing nearly 10000 homes classaction lawsuits against the 
company involve 60000 buyers 
we need to do a better job of protecting the public said 
stephen macnamara secretary of the department of business 
regulation clearly from what ive seen and read we have not 
done the job we should have done 
for its part state regulators waived any tangible security 
requirement for general development corp and big developers 
deltona corp and avatar holdings that would have guaranteed 
construction of roads and other basic improvements 
i was aware of the rule and unaware of the things being 
granted said macnamara who has headed the department for one 
year we definitely have to change the policy 
the state investigation is to determine what action should have 
been taken against the developer during the 1980s who was 
responsible for lax enforcement of state regulations and what 
charges are needed 
two recent resignations from the department involve the land 
sales division but neither the state nor the employees are saying 
if the resignations are related to general development corp 
e james kearney director of the division of land sales 
condominiums and mobile homes finished work friday samuel 
griffis bureau chief of land sales registration submitted his 
resignation march 15 
complaints filed at the division of land sales between 1987 and 
1989 charged that the developer was committing fraud and failing to 
complete road improvements for fully paid lot owners 
a 1985 agreement between general development corp and the 
division said that if the developer failed to meet its obligation 
to make road improvements for fully paid lot owners the division 
could seek administrative or judicial remedy 
despite mounting complaints kearney said he saw no reason to 
take action against the developer and said it had never missed 
making improvements theyve been delayed because of 
environmental reasons he said everybody gets delayed because 
of environmental reasons 
attorney richard bennett who has been battling for general 
developer corp home and lot owners for six years complained that 
the division of land sales was not consumeroriented and not 
aggressive in solving the complaints 
thats why weve brought these classactions because gdc 
breached its contract with its customers and the customers were 
unable to persuade state or federal governmental regulators to 
assist them to resolve their complaints he said 
macnamara says he may want to toughen division policies and give 
consumers more information about developers involved in lawsuits 
if the division of land sales is not already required to turn 
over information to the attorney generals office about a developer 
suspected of fraudulent dealings the practice should become 
division policy he said 
general development corp estimates it would cost about 400 
million to finish developing its land but only 1021 million is 
budgeted for improvements according to its latest annual report to 
the securities and exchange commission

rival christian forces pounded east 
beirut with artillery barrages saturday after a night of 
housetohouse fighting under parachute flares for control of 
lebanons christian enclave 
police said at least 53 people were killed and 133 wounded since 
the new round of fullscale warfare erupted at dawn friday between 
gen michel aouns 19000 army troops and christian warlord samir 
geageas 6000 lebanese forces militiamen 
the killings raised the overall death toll to 829 killed and 
2289 wounded since jan 30 when aoun moved against geagea in a 
bid to crush the only significant challenge to the generals 
authority in the 310squaremile christian enclave 
the new round of fighting shattered a march 3 ceasefire which 
had been threatened by sporadic clashes for weeks 
police said aouns forces used 155mm howitzer batteries to pour 
shells onto beiruts port and the adjacent seaside karantina 
district which houses geageas military command 
geageas gunners returned the fire and blasted the armyheld 
mountain resort towns of bekfaya brummana and ein saadeh with 
multibarreled rocket launchers 
why are these madmen raining death and destruction on us all 
over again screamed madeleine tabet a christian housewife 
reached by telephone at the basement of her east beirut home 
the bombardment interrupted an exodus of east beirut residents 
fleeing to the divided citys moslem sector cars in long lines 
bumped into each other as motorists driving westward came under 
shellfire 
huge clouds of black smoke obscured east beirut and the 
christian hinterland as the shelling raged saturday setting dozens 
of buildings ablaze and touching off forest fires 
shells hit schools churches monasteries apartments and 
bakeries in beiruts christian sector and several towns in kesrouan 
province 20 miles northeast of the capital 
police said gasoline storage tanks at several filling stations 
hit friday burned out of control through saturday scores of houses 
collapsed some on their tenants 
parachute flares illuminated kesrouan as the warring christians 
battled at night for the key highway town of kleiat and neighboring 
villages police reported 
they are fighting from house to house in kleiat and trading 
hitandrun grenade assaults in the streets of east beirut the 
dust hasnt settled yet but no side has made any territorial 
gains said the police spokeman he could not be named under 
standing regulations 
kleiat controls the only highway that can be used by tanks 
between kesrouan a major geagea stronghold and aouns main power 
bases in metn province 
tens of thousands of residents remained huddled in basements and 
bomb shelters in east beirut for a second day while hundreds of 
familes sought refuge in the chilly pine forests of kesrouan the 
spokesman said 
aouns failure to subdue geagea appears to be undermining his 
political stature and geageas public appeals for a settlement 
based on a christian allegiance to the syrianbacked government of 
president elias hrawi have been gaining momentum 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronites a 900000strong christian 
sect that has dominated lebanons politics since it gained 
independence from france in 1943 
antoine beshara a maronite who heads lebanons 300000strong 
federation of labor unions has declared support for hrawi whose 
internationally recognized government is based in moslem west 
beirut 
geageas militia on friday cooperated with troops under hrawis 
army commander gen emille lahoud when they reopened the port 
crossing between beiruts moslem and christian sectors after a 
yearlong closure 
hrawi 64 was elected by parliament nov 24 with a mandate to 
enforce an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to resolve lebanons 
civil war the peace plan gives moslems an equal share of power 
with christians 
hrawi fired aoun as army commander and interim prime minister 
but the general has held out in the presidential palace in a 
christian enclave east of beirut claiming hrawis election was 
unconstitutional 
aoun has also rejected the arab league peace plan because it did 
not guarantee a total withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops

the government closed all high schools in 
the capital and two suburbs saturday to try to curb student 
demonstrations for multiparty politics stateowned radio reported 
the move came hours after police fired tear gas and rifles to 
disperse about 5000 people who poured into the streets of patan a 
katmandu suburb to protest the killings of two demonstrators 
friday witnesses said 
the demonstrations are part of a growing movement demanding 
restoration of a multiparty political system in this himalayan 
kingdom one of the oldest monarchies in the world 
at least 14 people have been killed since feb 18 when king 
birendras government cracked down on the movement led by the 
nepali congress party and a coalition of leftwing parties 
in the lastest government response the stateowned radio 
quoting the ministry of education said about 100 schools in 
katmandu bhakatapur and patan will remain closed indefinitely 
due to lack of educational atmosphere in some schools of 
katmandu valley the government has decided to close down all high 
schools the radio said 
students have taken part in the nationwide demonstrations which 
have often turned violent hundreds of people including doctors 
lawyers and journalists in addition to students have been 
arrested 
the government had already closed tribhuvan universitys five 
colleges around the country 
besides street protests the political turmoil is also bringing 
criticism within the government it suffered the latest blow friday 
when foreign minister shailendra kumar upadhyaya resigned over the 
governments handling of the issue 
upadhyaya said he had advised prime minister marich man singh 
shrestha to hold talks with the activists but that his advice went 
unheeded 
the government says nepal already has a working democracy even 
though a royal decree bans political parties officials accuse the 
demonstrators of trying to foist their brand of democracy on the 
country 
nepal once tried a westernstyle democracy in 1959 when the 
nepali congress party was overwhelmingly voted to power and formed 
the countrys first parliamentary government the experiment ended 
when king mahendra birendras father dismissed the government in 
1961 accusing it of corruption and mismanagement

march 11 decisions of the lithuanian supreme soviet have brought us 
to a critical point 
the attempts being taken by the incumbent lithuanian leadership 
to break the republics ties with the soviet union and its tactics 
of unilateral and ultimate actions endanger the normal life and 
security of all people in the republic lithuanians and 
nonlithuanians and are a cause of grave concern in the country 
is it normal when amendments to the constitution resolving the 
destiny of the republic and its people and concerning the interests 
of the entire country are adopted in haste without consultations 
and discussions actually within one night 
the third congress of ussr peoples deputies urged the 
supreme soviet of the republic to renounce political recklessness 
the lithuanian leadership responded to this appeal for common sense 
with the escalation of irresponsible and illegitimate decisions 
this juxtaposes lithuania with other constituent republics and 
the whole of the soviet union and undermines the historically 
established ties and cooperation between our peoples 
the actions being taken in lithuania have no logical foundation 
they are being taken at a time when we have begun to resolve vital 
issues of the soviet federation on a really democratic basis 
what is our position it is the sincere adherence to the ideas 
of the free and original development of all peoples of our country 
and respect for their legitimate rights to selfdetermination and 
sovereignty this fully refers to the lithuanian people too 
now attempts are being made to convince you that genuine 
sovereignty within the soviet union without breaking away from it 
is impossible simultaneously old grudges are being purposefully 
kindled and the dark sides of joint life are being emphasized 
indeed our past includes many things that we are mutually 
rejecting and this refers not only to the lithuanian people but 
no one can say that in the years of perestroika any people in our 
country has been deliberately elevated or purposefully humiliated 
we have for years lived in one home does the past time deserve 
only bad words have the lithuanian literature and poetry theater 
and cinema music and architecture education and sports faded and 
got lost in the multicoloured soviet culture 
was it not in the mutual work and with the fraternal aid from 
other republics that your industry and agriculture have been 
developing did lithuania itself not extend a helping hand to other 
peoples in times of trouble 
did the lithuanian citizens not support the ussr 
constitution by which lithuania abided for years honestly and 
strictly as a fullyfledged republic 
the incumbent lithuanian leaders are trying to convince you that 
their separatist actions will not affect the economic scientific 
technical and other ties with the other republics of the ussr 
but this is not so because all these ties can develop normally 
and yield fruits only in a favourable atmosphere of confidence and 
mutual assistance and not in the situation of confrontation 
ultimatums disrespect for one another and ethnic strife 
the pointed disrespect for the ussr constitution the 
challenge to soviet laws and the nonimplementation of union 
obligations give rise to just indignation all over the country 
the president of the ussr the ussr supreme soviet and 
the ussr government are receiving numerous letters and 
telegrams expressing utter concern and perplexity in connection 
with the developments in lithuania 
people demand that the ussr constitution be defended and 
that the union be protected from the harm caused by the actions of 
separatists they propose taking effective economic political and 
administrative measures 
people in byelorussia and kaliningrad region are raising the 
issue of returning territories transferred to lithuania after it 
joined the ussr 
in general the situation in the republic and around it has 
become dramatic if the voice of reason is not heeded now 
developments can have grave consequences for all of us we must be 
united in striving to prevent this 
i have appealed to the lithuanian supreme soviet proposing that 
it immediately annul the illegal acts it has adopted this will 
open a possibility for discussing the entire range of problems on 
the solely acceptable basis within the framework of the ussr 
constitution 
i am expressing hope that my appeal will be supported by the 
citizens of the lithuanian soviet socialist republic

eastern airlines took no action against a flight 
engineer who tested positive for cocaine use until managers learned 
he had been charged with buying crack seven months later the 
airline said saturday 
the test results apparently went unnoticed because of a clerical 
error said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
dain schneemilch 36 of key largo fla was fired march 20 
but the air line pilots association has filed a grievance to appeal 
the dismissal she said 
schneemilch returned to work for the strikeplagued carrier in 
the midst of a machinists union strike that initially brought 
eastern flights to a virtual halt under company policy returning 
workers were required to submit to drug tests 
schneemilch tested positive for cocaine use last july 19 an 
offense that warrants firing under eastern rules the miamibased 
airline said but the results entered his personnel file without 
action 
we were in the middle of a big buildup ceremsak said 
there was a tremendous volume at that time somehow 
inadvertently the results of his tests were not picked up on it 
was some sort of clerical error that his positive readout was not 
caught 
schneemilch went back to work as a second officer serving as 
flight engineer the no 3 position in the cockpit on boeing 727s 
he bid to become a first officer or copilot and got the 
promotion on the basis of seniority sept 18 ceremsak said 
schneemilch was still attending ground pilot school when he was 
arrested after allegedly buying a 20 crack cocaine rock from an 
undercover sheriffs officer ceremsak said he flew no airline 
flights as a copilot she said 
authorities have video and audio tapes of the arrest 
schneemilch who tested negative for cocaine in an eastern test 
four days before his arrest has pleaded innocent and is awaiting 
disposition of the drug case 
defense attorney timothy thomes refused comment saying were 
not trying to cover anything up but by the same token while 
matters are pending we would have no comment 
when it learned of the arrest eastern checked its drug test 
results found the old records and confronted schneemilch ceremsak 
said he resigned but rescinded his resignation two weeks later 
which led to his firing last month 
the federal aviation administration asked us to go back and 
review all of the drug tests that had been administered and we 
went back through hundreds of files and that was the only error 
she said 
the faa has ordered random drug testing of airline employees 
since last december eastern policy already called for testing of 
all new employees and testing of pilots during their annual 
physical 
christopher witkowski director of the aviation consumer action 
project questioned easterns methods for assuring its pilots are 
drugfree and faa monitoring when eastern was hiring about 1000 
pilots from april to august last year 
to say that its an oversight shows that theres something 
wrong in how safe an airline they are he said

nasa in a rare move advanced the 
launch date saturday for the shuttle discovery and its prestigious 
payload the 15 billion hubble space telescope 
discovery now is due to lift off april 10 two days earlier than 
planned 
the shuttle team is ready to fly hubble is one of the most 
exciting payloads ever launched aboard the shuttle and were 
looking forward to the mission said william lenoir associate 
administrator for space flight for the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
the space agencys flight readiness review board decided to move 
up the mission after meeting for two days at kennedy space center 
nasa said last week technicians needed little of the contingency 
time built into discoverys prelaunch schedule 
once deployed by discoverys astronauts the hubble will orbit 
380 miles above earth for 15 years the telescope will be capable 
of looking seven times more deeply into space with greater clarity 
and detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best groundbased 
observatory 
astronomers expect to use it to study stars and galaxies so 
distant that their light has been traveling toward earth for 14 
billion years 
nasa occasionally has shifted shuttle launch dates because of 
scheduling changes in the months prior to liftoff but it is the 
first time liftoff has been accelerated during orbiter processing 
in february discoverys launch date was changed from april 18 
to april 12 after the lower right segment of the shuttles solid 
rocket booster was replaced more quickly than anticipated 
the telescopes installation into the orbiter was delayed last 
week however after small mosquitolike insects called midges 
invaded a payload preparation room at the launch pad engineers 
feared the bugs might damage the sensitive instrument the most 
expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built 
forty midges were trapped and technicians loaded the 
25000pound telescope into the shuttles payload bay thursday two 
days later than planned 
mission specialist bruce mccandless ii one of discoverys five 
astronauts helped link electrical connections between discovery 
and hubble on friday he also checked the telescope for sharp edges 
that might snag spacesuits in the event of a spacewalk 
mccandless and mission specialist kathryn sullivan are prepared 
to step into space should the telescope need to be adjusted or 
repaired following deployment it would be the first american 
spacewalk since 1985 
technicians planned to test the telescopes systems and 
scientific instruments sunday they want to ensure remote 
communications with the space telescope operations control center 
at nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt md and other 
facilities 
the telescope is named for the late american astronomer edwin p 
hubble who discovered in the 1920s the universe is constantly 
expanding a finding that is the basis for the current big bang 
theory of the formation of the universe

deadly pet piranha fish that could threaten oklahoma wildlife and 
just to prove it he brought the fish to court frozen in a 
dripping bag of ice 
bob geary was cited in early january for violating a state law 
banning piranhas because they could pose a danger to wildlife if

and he asked a district judge jan 26 to give him a chance to keep 
it

department to let him keep the fish and promised to send it to 
kansas if he failed but he returned to court friday to say the 
deal is well dead 
geary said the fish died two weeks ago when someone mistakenly 
turned up the heat in its tank 
prosecutor clayton niemeyer had agreed to drop the case if geary 
could prove the fish had died he spent 4000 defending his fish 
and the fish is no longer alive so i saw no reason to pursue it 
further niemeyer said 
niemeyer called the evidence produced in court friday a 
fishsicle 
the frozen piranha was turned over to state wildlife rangers 
who said they would have it stuffed and use it for educational 
purposes

expensive musical instruments even as police with riot shields 
tried to clear the area two china shops on regent street also had 
their display windows pillaged 
many of the broken windows set off burglar alarms which mixed 
with the constant wail of police sirens and fire engines 
the rioting broke out in late afternoon as the stores prepared 
to close for the weekend it spread into the evening and overtook 
theatergoers headed into londons west end for a saturday night out

jeanmarie le pen whipped his followers into 
a frenzy of applause and singing saturday promising them that 
their extremeright national front party stands on the threshold of 
real political power 
the 1600 delegates to the eighth party congress chose le pen by 
cheers and handclapping to lead the party from the sidelines of 
singleissue politics to what they hope will be victory in 1993 
legislative elections 
if i advance follow me if i die avenge me if i shirk kill 
me the former paratrooper told the delegates we are no longer 
a tiny movement we are today the leading political movement in 
france 
le pen founded the antiimmigration party in 1972 and achieved 
global notoriety in 1987 when he called the nazi holocaust a 
detail of history 
in a 90minute speech punctuated by frequent applause and 
chants le pen accused both the governing socialists and 
traditional conservative parties of political aids 
he hammered away at a favorite theme that other politicians 
turn a blind eye to immigration thereby stoking racial pressures 
that will soon be insoluble except through violence 
after the speech and le pens reelection in the vast 
flagdraped amphitheater on the french riviera the crowd broke 
into the ode to joy from beethovens ninth symphony 
earlier about 700 people prayed outside the palace of justice 
for the 6 million jews killed during the holocaust and to protest 
the attendance of franz schoenhuber leader of west germanys 
farright republican party 
schoenhuber was a soldier in the nazi ss during world war ii 
his party and the national front form an alliance at the european 
parliament in strasbourg 
the national front won 12 pecent of the vote in presidential 
elections in 1988 based on its antiimmigration platform its 
support is strongest among white voters in areas where large 
numbers of north african and black immigrants live 
about 4 million of the countrys 55 million people are 
immigrants the majority of them moslems from north africa 
we are the expression of the french people who want to become 
once again their own masters said bruno megret the partys 
second in command we will be in power before the end of the 
decade 
the national front hopes to broaden its platform to include 
ecological issues in an effort to woo rural voters the party 
recently gained its first seat in the 577seat national assembly 
it held 35 seats until electoral changes in 1988 left the party 
without representation 
the congress came as leaders of frances mainstream conservative 
parties met near paris to work out a common position on immigration 
ahead of talks with the socialist government on racism next week 
premier michel rocard called for a conference with opposition 
leaders to develop a common strategy on racism following a series 
of racially motivated killings and beatings over past months the 
national front was not invited 
the mainstream rightist parties say antiracism measures must be 
accompanied by a revamped policy on immigration 
former president valery giscard destaing leader of the union 
for french democracy coalition urged deporting illegal immigrants 
tightening political asylum rules cutting social benefits to 
immigrants and curbing the entry of their family members 
france is not a country of immigration giscard said the 
most serious fault of the government is to have left this debate to 
the extremists foreigners can live in france with respect for 
their human rights but they cannot change france 
a poll taken during a sixmonth government investigation into 
racism showed monday that 75 percent of french citizens thought 
there were too many north africans in france

the new local tax system that has angered many 
britons and prompted protests and riots across the country goes 
into effect sunday in england and wales 
scotland has had the tax for a year 
anger over the tax has contributed to a record 28point lead by 
the main opposition labor party over prime minister margaret 
thatchers governing conservatives according to a harris poll last 
weekend 
the community charge is levied by local governments on every 
adult in a household it replaces a single tax paid by each 
household and based on the value of the property 
that means that now a family with four members over age 18 
living in a small apartment will pay four times as much as a single 
person living in a large house 
a duke in a 100room mansion would pay as much as a street 
sweeper in a cottage if they live in the same borough 
the amount each person will pay is the same throughout a 
community but it varies widely from borough to borough depending 
on the budget needs of the area 
critics of the new tax have dubbed it the poll tax after a 
percapita tax that set off a peasants revolt in 1381 
lowincome and disabled people can receive rebates of up to 80 
percent on the new tax but critics say it is unfair because unlike 
the income tax which is used to pay for national government 
expenditures it does not take into account an individuals ability 
to pay 
legislation written by mrs thatchers government created the 
tax with the aim of reducing central government subsidies to local 
government but members of local councils determine how much to 
charge 
the government expected the labor party to suffer in elections 
because highspending councils with a wide range of public services 
are mostly run by labor members who would have to set a high poll 
tax to pay for them 
but many of the highest increases have been set by conservative 
councils to maintain their services 
the public was initially assured by civil servants and 
conservative lawmakers that the increases would be quite small 
scotland has had the tax for a year 
the peasants revolt of 1381 followed the imposition of the last 
poll tax in england when every person over the age of 15 was 
ordered to pay 
crying hang all the lawyers 100000 peasants marched on 
london they pillaged manor houses burnt the court rolls 
containing their names to destroy the evidence for taxation and 
murdered lawyers magistrates and other officials 
archbishop of canterbury simon of sudbury a lawyer was also 
chancellor of england and regarded by the rebels as one of those 
responsible for imposing the tax the rebels dragged him from the 
tower of london and beheaded him on tower hill 
king richard ii rode to meet the rebels at smithfield site of 
londons presentday wholesale meat market and peasant leader wat 
tyler was slain 
the insurgents dispersed on the kings promise of reforms but 
richard sent an army of 40000 men through the most rebellious 
counties of kent and essex and hundreds of peasants were put to 
death

investigators said saturday that a 
medical helicopters engine cover came loose and was chopped up by 
the rotor blades scattering metal and fiberglass fragments on a 
street where youths were playing 
no one was injured in thursdays incident in this pittsburgh 
suburb the helicopter flying to washington hospital to pick up a 
patient returned safely to its base at allegheny general hospital 
in pittsburgh 
originally the accident had been blamed on a bird 
tom mahony a safety inspector with the federal aviation 
administration said the most critical of the six latches holding a 
fiberglass cowling in place over the engine apparently failed 
an investigation on friday found the latch shows some wear 
more than is normal mahony said its apparent that the latch 
had failed and the airstream got underneath the cowling until it 
separated from the airframe 
the 2by4foot section got caught in the helicopters main 
rotors and was torn apart mahony said one of the four rotors 
which are made of fiberglass with a metal leading edge had what he 
termed very minor damage 
mahony said the investigation ruled out the possibility the 
helicopter had collided with a bird as hospital officials 
initially suspected 
about a dozen metal and fiberglass fragments one measuring more 
than a foot square showered down near where six children were 
playing street hockey 
its a miracle none of us were hit said one of the boys 
michael rosenberger 17 
the helicopter a messerschmittbolkowblohm bk117 will return 
to service as soon as repairs are completed mahony said no action 
will be taken against the pilot john johnston or the hospital 
the faa probably will carry out informal checks to determine 
whether similar incidents have occurred he said 
the hospital made a thorough inspection of its other two life 
flight helicopters and found nothing wrong said spokesman tom

residents in this liberal college town 
vote monday on whether to impose a token 5 fine for abortions if 
the procedure ever is banned by state or federal law 
abortion rights advocates say the small fine would create a 
zone of reproductive freedom in the event of a state or federal 
ban but the mayor who favors abortion rights says it would hurt 
the citys reputation the fine would be imposed on both the doctor 
performing an abortion and the woman who underwent the operation 
what it says to police is dont go looking for abortion 
criminals go look for murderers and rapists said sabra briere 
who put the proposal on the ballot with a 4127signature petition 
drive 
the ballot issue is yet another front in the lengthy emotional 
war over abortion on friday idaho gov cecil andrus vetoed a bill 
that would have created the nations most restrictive state 
abortion law 
proponents of the initiative say that if it were passed and if 
abortion were someday outlawed city police would enforce the token 
fine while state police would enforce whatever measure was approved 
statewide 
ann arbor a city of nearly 108000 people that is home to the 
university of michigan bucked the michigan trend on a 1988 ballot 
by supporting the use of state funds for poor womens abortions 
briere a student services coordinator at the university said 
friday i dont want to see abortion under attack any longer it 
shouldnt even be an issue at all 
the charter provision to make abortion an infraction similar to 
a parking ticket would go into effect in the event of a state or 
federal ban 
about 22000 of ann arbors 60000 registered voters are 
expected to cast ballots monday about 15 percent of those voting 
are expected to be students said republican mayor jerry jernigan 
jernigan said the city council is prochoice but said he 
doesnt believe the city should have jurisdiction over an issue 
such as abortion 
theres no question that this is hurting ann arbors 
reputation jernigan said explaining that if the proposal 
passes it would make the city known as a place to get an abortion 
he said the issue should have been been aired in public 
hearings which are not required for city ballot measures under 
city law the council could also enact such a fine 
city councilman tom richardson a republican facing reelection 
monday agreed that the proposal doesnt belong on the city charter 
i think its absolutely abhorrent to take such a serious issue 
as abortion and treat it in such a flippant way he said 
local antiabortion activists have remained relatively silent 
about the proposal concentrating instead on a petition drive to 
require parental consent for anyone under 18 to have an abortion 
were putting our energies where theyre more needed and more 
effective said barbara listing president of right to life of 
michigan 
also on mondays ballot in the city 38 miles west of detroit is 
a symbolic proposal to increase the fine for possessing or selling 
marijuanan from 5 to 25 the fine has been in place since 1974 
enabling the city to prosecute offenders for ordinance violations 
instead of misdemeanors under state law 
listing said saturday she was basically ignoring the abortion 
vote 
ann arbor is a rather unique community she said even if 
it does pass its really not going to have any effect abortion is 
still legal

much spiritual as political and were brought about by divine 
intervention in the affairs of men a mormon church leader said 
saturday

intervening hand of the almighty elder david b haight told the 
160th annual general conference of the church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints 
the 73 millionmember church has acted quickly to take 
advantage of democratic political reforms in eastern europe 
on july 1 church officials will establish the first mormon 
missions in poland czechoslovakia and hungary since 1950 the plan 
was announced previously 
they hope eventually to gain recognition in the soviet union 
the peoples republic of china and many islamic countries where the 
utahbased church has no official presence 
also saturday church leaders announced that a brazilian lay 
minister had been appointed to the highest church post ever held by 
a black helvecio martins of rio de janeiro was named to the 
second quorum of the seventy the lowest tier in the administrative 
hierarchy of the 106yearold church

the appointment is for five years 
haight speaking in the tabernacle on temple square challenged 
church members to serve their fellow men by teaching the gospel of 
jesus christ 
we declare in all solemnity that the lord is now preparing the 
nations of the earth to receive the truth he desires them to 
have said haight a member of the faiths quorum of the twelve 
apostles which advises the governing first presidency 
haight said the news media have portrayed events in eastern 
europe as a purely political revolution when most of the 
inhabitants of those countries see the upheaval as religious and 
have acknowledged the influence of divine revelation 
the church founded by joseph smith in upstate new york in 1830 
has more than 40000 fulltime missionaries and 228 missions 
mormons believe their church was formed for the purpose of teaching 
the true gospel before christs return

behalf saying mormons have a responsibility to extend help as 
well as hope to the hungry to the homeless and to the downtrodden 
both at home and abroad 
elder hans b ringger urged church members who sometimes are 
seen by their neighbors as standoffish to move beyond their own 
social and cultural circles 
the needy are all around us too often however we are blind 
to those needs or fear those people whose company makes us feel 
uncomfortable ringger said we have to rid ourselves of 
religious racial or social prejudices and expand the boundaries of 
our service

president robert mugabe failed to 
realize his dream of a oneparty state when three opposition 
members captured seats in parliamentary elections according to 
partial returns saturday 
its a bitter blow said a spokesman for mugabes governing 
marxistleninist zimbabwe african national union yet it could 
have been worse 
officials said 80 of 120 contested seats for the 150member 
parliament had been counted at the end of the day and final 
results were expected to be announced sunday 
however mugabe clearly emerged as the presidential victor his 
first challenger ever edgar tekere gained only 365149 votes or 
173 percent with returns counted in 106 districts 
tekeres fledgling opposition party campaigning for similar 
political reforms to those in eastern europe captured more votes 
than most analysts expected 
in the voting held wednesday through friday tekeres zimbabwe 
unity movement won a third of the ballots capturing two 
parliamentary seats according to election officials 
the candidate of the zimbabwe african national union or ndonga 
gained a third seat the union represents the founder of the 
governing party the rev ndabaningi sithole 
a methodist minister sithole has been living in exile in the 
united states for several years accused by security agents at home 
of plotting to topple mugabes government 
tekere and an independent businessman represent the only 
oppositon in the current body 
mugabe 66 led the whiteruled british colony of rhodesia to 
independence as blackgoverned zimbabwe after a sevenyear 
guerrilla war 
but he has repeatedly said he wants a marxist oneparty system 
in what is now one of africas few democracies arguing that feuds 
between rival movements in the infancy of independence hamper 
development 
tekere 52 was a ounder of mugabes party in 1963 when its aim 
was to end 90 years of white minority rule the past two years 
however he has argued against a oneparty state tekere was fired 
from the governing party in 1988 after accusing politicians of 
widespread corruption 
tekere pointing to eastern europe has contended that zimbabwe 
should broaden democracy and liberalize its economy 
during the bitter campaign mugabe accused tekere of plotting a 
coup if he lost the election tekere claimed mugabe was bent on 
establishing a marxist dictatorship 
a weakness for tekere is that many zimbabweans remember that 
shortly after independence he was acquitted on a legal 
technicality of murdering an elderly white farmer 
a western african diplomat said the parliamentary districts held 
by the opposition in the past were always marginal seats that 
did not present a real challenge to the governing party 
mugabes going to win but he might find himself with an 
opposition the diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
during the campaign mugabe told voters his administration had 
provided cheap health care and education 
fewer than half of the 48 million registered voters bothered to 
go to the polls even though they were extended from two days to 
three

soldiers wounded in a series of new clashes 
contra representatives signed an agreement with nicaraguas 
incoming government to disband by april 20 five days before the 
new administration of the united national opposition takes over 
from the leftist sandinistas 
despite that march 23 pact rebel leaders have said their forces 
were taking their weapons as they moved from jungle camps in 
neighboring honduras back into nicaragua 
contra leaders said last week that nearly all 12000 of the 
rebels in the camps had returned home 
in its report saturday the sandinista newspaper barricada said 
at least 1000 contras have moved back to jinotega province a 
border area 120 miles north of managua 
quoting an unidentified high sandinista military leader 
barricada said all indications are that the contras are 
preparing for an offensive 
the rebels are united and ready to develop a conventional war 
with sufficient munitions and supplies for two months the

officials fighting to carry out 
californias first execution in 23 years said saturday the us 
supreme court had agreed to consider an appeal of a ruling blocking 
the death sentence 
the high court will take up the case of convicted double 
murderer robert alton harris on monday said state attorney general 
john van de kamp 
after years of appeals harris 37 was scheduled to die in the 
gas chamber tuesday for the kidnapping and murders of two san diego 
teenagers in july 1978 
but a federal appeals court on friday stayed the execution 
judge john noonan of the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 
that a lower court improperly refused to hold a factfinding 
hearing on harris claim he didnt get adequate psychiatric 
evaluation at the time of his original trial in 1979 
the state immediately appealed the ruling 
if robert harris had been deprived of his constitutional 
rights in some way then i would agree that further delay would 
be fair and reasonable van de kamp told a news conference 
saturday but harris has received a fair trial and the most 
painstaking federal review 
the supreme court has told us that they will take the case 
van de kamp added 
a spokesman for the high court confirmed the appeal had been 
filed but declined to comment on whether or when the justices would 
consider it 
there is no legal or moral reason why the execution should 
not proceed as scheduled state van de kamp said in the emergency 
appeal 
van de kamp wrote that harris lastditch strained attempt to 
attack the competency of his trial psychiatrists 11 years after the 
fact demonstrates unjustified delay and an unconscionable 
abuse of the appeals process 
the us supreme court has turned down four of harris earlier 
appeals and never ruled in his favor 
harris arguments about inadequate psychiatric evaluation were 
rejected wednesday by a us district court in san diego 
if the appeals court decision friday were allowed to stand the 
case would go to a threejudge appeals court panel that panel 
would decide if the federal court in san diego should be ordered to 
hold an evidentiary hearing on the defense contention on 
psychiatric evaluation 
harris was convicted of kidnapping john mayeski and michael 
baker both 16 from a fast food restaurant and shooting them to 
death so could use their car in a bank robbery 
noonans ruling angered and saddened the families of the victims 
where the hell is justice quick and swift said bill 
stalder the uncle of john mayeski this is tomfoolery its 
playing a game and its shouldnt be its disgusting 
but death penalty opponents some of whom have been fasting and 
taking part in a vigil outside the gates of san quentin prison 
were heartened 
im glad that there is one good mind heart and soul within 
the 9th circuit court that said we need to think about this a 
little more before we execute a human being in the state of 
california said stephen souza a member of amnesty international 
and death penalty focus 
surely we can think of something other than killing somebody 
for his crimes said singer joan baez shortly before 300 death 
penalty foes marched across the golden gate bridge saturday morning

prime minister margaret thatcher 
quashed speculation she might retire and told cheering supporters 
of her conservative party saturday that she still has the 
stomach for the fight ahead 
despite a dramatic slump in popularity and the prospect of a 
battle to succeed her mrs thatcher announced there was no 
vacancy at 10 downing st the prime ministers official 
residence in london 
she spoke at a conservative central council meeting in the 
gloucestershire town of cheltenham about 100 miles northwest of 
london 
protesters angry over a new local tax championed by the 
conservatives tore through central london saturday afternoon 
hurling rocks at police looting stores and terrifying tourists and 
local residents alike more than 130 people were injured 
mrs thatchers speech came three days after the conservatives 
former chairman norman tebbit announced he would run for the 
leadership post if mrs thatcher quit before the next election the 
vote must be held by mid1992 
rightwinger tebbits surprise announcement raised the 
possibility of a leadership battle with former defense secretary 
michael heseltine he represents the partys centerleft and he is 
the frontrunner in opinion polls to succeed the prime minister 
but on saturday mrs thatcher made it clear she planned to lead 
the conservatives into the next election 
to avoid any possible misunderstanding and at the risk of 
disappointing a few gallant colonels let me make one thing 
absolutely clear i havent come to cheltenham to retire she 
said 
you may have noticed that i seem lately to have been subjected 
to a certain amount of criticism not by the way for the first 
time nor i dare say for the last she said criticism is one 
of the perks of the job she said 
she told the party faithful to keep fighting to win a shining 
future and assured them she was prepared to lead the battle i 
have the stomach for that fight so do you and so i believe does 
britain 
mrs thatchers popularity has been eroded by rising inflation 
high mortgage rates and the new local tax being imposed across the 
country 
the opposition labor party had a record 28point lead over the 
tories in the latest harris poll last weekend

state police tried to negotiate their way 
onto a mohawk indian settlement where they believe shots were fired 
at a military helicopter but indian leaders insisted saturday no 
outsiders would set foot on their land 
both sides patrolled blockades on the four roads leading into 
the ganienkeh mohawk territory near the canadian border state 
police set up the roadblocks friday after a vermont national guard 
helicopter on an emergency medical flight was hit by three bullets 
forcing it to land in a field on indian land 
a civilian doctor suffered a gunshot wound in the right arm and 
was listed in good condition 
authorities failed saturday to persuade indian leaders to allow 
state troopers onto indian territory to investigate the attack but 
both sides agreed to resume talks sunday morning said state police 
maj robert leu 
i dont think this will be long and drawn out said leu 
we are very close to what we want to achieve which is to 
complete our investigation in the next couple of days 
police have yet to identify a suspect 
the ganienkeh indians like other mohawks in northern new york 
claim their land is sovereign territory and that federal or state 
authorities lack jurisdiction there 
busloads of people normally travel on weekends to the territory 
to play highstakes bingo but the games were canceled this weekend 
the helicopter was flying at about 200 feet when it was fired on 
at noon friday said state trooper richard garcia dr james van 
kirk 27 was recovering saturday at vermont medical center in 
burlington where he works 
people aboard the chopper told authorities they believed the 
shots came from the sparsely populated 700acre indian territory 
but police arent yet certain that was the case garcia said 
the determination is not clear yet garcia said 
daryl martin a spokesman for the indians insisted the shots 
did not come from the encampment 
three military crew members and a civilian doctor and nurse were 
aboard the uh1 chopper which because of weather had aborted a 
mission to pick up a patient 
the mohawk roadblocks were set up beside police blockades to 
keep authorities from coming onto the settlement he said adding 
as long as their roadblocks stay up were going to keep ours 
up 
a meeting friday night between state police and mohawk leaders 
turned out to be a total farce martin said 
they just seem to be very hardline very hardnosed and 
insistent on violating our treaty rights he said were afraid 
of any type of invasion 
in albany fbi agent wayne alford said top priority was being 
given to investigating the attempted murder of those on board the 
aircraft any federal violations would be secondary to the state 
police investigation of those charges he said 
fbi agents were at the scene but were not involved in the 
negotiations he said 
the state police will do everything they can to resolve this 
peacefully alford said if it takes a long time to do that 
then well take a long time 
indian leaders have been talking informally with state police at 
the roadblocks but some meetings have turned into yelling 
matches martin said 
the indians made a few concessions saturday the allowed state 
police to fly a helicopter over the area where the shooting 
occurred martin said 
the also admitted a crew to work on the crippled craft and said 
they would allow it to be flown away once repairs were finished 
garcia said 
gov mario cuomo said saturday that people in the altona 
area have resisted ganienkeh a suggestion that someone outside 
the encampment may have fired the shots to discredit the mohawks 
when cuomo was new yorks secretary of state in 1977 he helped 
negotiate an end to a threeyear occupation by mohawks of land at 
moss lake about 100 miles southwest of altona that agreement led 
to the creation of the ganienkeh encampment where about 40 mohawks 
live on 700 acres 
the mohawks claimed the camp was among 9 million acres in new 
york and vermont wrongfully taken from them in the 18th century 
fifteen years ago a 22yearold man and a 9yearold girl were 
shot and wounded while riding in cars near another ganienkeh 
encampment and the indians also refused to cooperate no one was 
ever charged 
the mohawks at ganienkeh which means land of the flint say 
they are trying to protect ancient mohawk traditions and culture by 
living in a community that does not accept aid from federal state 
or county governments 
whites are not allowed onto the core of the settlement though 
ganienkeh spokesmen said the bingo hall was opened in 1988 as a 
means of raising money to build roads a clinic and make other 
community improvements 
mohawks have ignored restraining orders secured by new york 
state authorities to close the 1400seat bingo hall 
one leader said ganienkeh residents will defend their encampment 
if they are attacked or invaded they will readily stand up to 
the defense of their territory said kakwirakeron they do not 
allow new york state to exercise any jurisdiction whatsoever within 
their territory 
kakwirakeron also known as art montour is on trial in federal 
court in syracuse on a charge of impeding fbi agents and new york 
state police during a 1989 casino raid on the st regis mohawk 
reservation along the new yorkcanadian border

an antitax demonstration by 40000 people turned 
into a riot saturday when militants pelted police with rocks and 
bottles set fires to cars and smashed shop windows in a rampage 
through central london 
it was the worst violence in britain since 1985 at least 341 
people were arrested 58 police were hurt and at least 75 civilians 
were taken to hospitals police said many of the injured were 
released after treatment 
the worst of the trouble was over four hours after it began but 
sporadic vandalism and looting continued into the night some areas 
of the west end shopping and theater district looked like 
battlegrounds and sirens and burglar alarms of vandalized stores 
blared up and down the streets 
for most of the afternoon protesters waved their placards 
peacefully in marches and at a rally in trafalgar square 
denouncing the unpopular new socalled poll tax which takes effect 
sunday 
it will be levied by local governments on every adult in a 
household and replaces a single household tax based on property 
values under the new system a duke in a 100room mansion will pay 
as much as a street sweeper in a cottage if they live in the same 
borough 
the tax has aroused anger throughout britain and generated 
widespread hostility toward prime minister margaret thatcher but 
she said saturday she had no intention of retiring and that she 
still had the stomach for the fight ahead 
clashes with police on foot and horseback began at about 3 
pm near mrs thatchers residence on downing street off 
whitehall one of half a dozen streets that lead off trafalgar 
square the large plaza is in the heart of london near parliament 
the thames river and the theater district mrs thatcher was not at 
downing street 
the trouble started when a breakaway group of several hundred 
militants began a protest on whitehall south of the square 
police in riot gear joined 40 mounted officers to stem the 
violence but at least one officer was knocked unconscious as 
protesters hit police lines with rocks from a nearby building site 
other police officers and people in the crowd were hurt 
police on horseback sealed off whitehall so it could not be 
entered from the square and demonstration organizers appealed to 
thousands of people watching the tense situation to disperse via 
the other side of the square 
they refused however and continued to chant and wave antipoll 
tax banners 
as the trouble grew a fire broke out at a sevenstory building 
on trafalgar square and police and a witness said it apparently 
was started by a protester smoke poured out above the building 
undergoing reconstruction before firefighters put it out at about 
730 pm 
a group of about 60 young men ran along regent street north of 
the square hurling trash cans and newspaper racks through the 
windows of shops and arcades shop employees reported looting 
other rioters moved along st martins lane which leads north 
from the square overturning cars near the english national opera 
burning several and breaking windows of restaurants and shops 
on charing cross road which also leads north out of the square 
more cars were overturned and set afire and big garbage containers 
outside restaurants were pushed over spilling the contents into 
the street 
the trouble continued north to leicester square the film 
entertainment and theater center of the city the busiest place in 
london on a saturday evening subway stations in the area were 
closed 
at trafalgar square mounted police pelted with rocks and 
bottles moved in to try to clear out demonstrators at one point 
about 1000 protesters chanting no poll tax gathered in front 
of the national gallery on the north side surrounded by mounted 
police in riot gear and police on foot 
the police tried to crush us from both sides from whitehall 
people were in a panic there were young children there and old 
people but the horses were stepping on anybody said a student 
who gave only her first name lara 
but iain mccallum of surrey said there is no doubt that the 
police were being provoked there were guys throwing bottles and 
cans at them shouting abuse they just wanted to cause trouble 
when police forced the demonstrators out of the square by its 
northwest exit the mob surged up haymarket kicking in shop 
windows a mcdonalds was badly damaged theatergoers and tourists 
ran for cover as the mob used anything they could to smash windows 
david meynell police deputy assistant commisioner at scotland 
yard said the march by 40000 was completely overshadowed by 
the violent actions of about 3000 to 3500 militants he said he 
couldnt name the groups but that there were black flags flying 
which indicated anarchists among the crowd 
legislator george galloway of the socialist opposition labor 
party sitting sadly at the base of nelsons column in trafalgar 
square condemned the violence 
to see sections of the crowd cheering on the rioters it shows 
the depth of hatred of this poll tax and the extent of the 
alienation in the country and that disturbs me said galloway 
whose party opposes the tax 
he said police actions were clearly retaliatory and frankly 
necessary to save their own lives 
it was a wellorganized demonstration but these lunatics 
anarchists and other extremists principally from the socialist 
workers party were out for a rumble the whole time and now 
theyve got it and if they didnt exist the tories would need to 
invent them 
the socialist workers party denied it was responsible for the 
violence and blamed police 
mrs thatcher saturday told cheering supporters in cheltenham 
about 100 miles northwest of london that she had no intention of 
retiring despite growing criticism and her dramatic slump in 
popularity 
she told the conservative party faithful to keep fighting to win 
a shining future and said she was prepared to lead the battle 
i have the stomach for that fight so do you and so i believe 
does britain 
mrs thatchers 11year premiership has seen severe rioting 
mostly by young blacks protesting at unemployment alleged 
discrimination and police raids on drinking clubs and suspected 
drug users 
saturdays london violence was the worst since september 1985 
when crowds of young blacks and some whites clashed with police in 
the northern industrial city of birmingham two ugandanborn 
brothers died there when their post office was burnt out

liquor to social clubs he spoke to the associated press on the 
condition of anonymity 
the retailer said that by friday afternoon he had not heard from 
any of the clubs that normally contact him during the day to place 
orders 
because they are not licensed social clubs cannot obtain liquor 
from wholesalers and must buy from retailers such sales often 
violate state rules limiting the amount of liquor any one person 
can buy retail at one time

at a brooklyn club that was raided thursday night admitted that

west germanys central bank saturday 
recommended a 2to1 conversion rate for east german currency as 
part of a plan to form an economic union between the two states 
however some members of chancellor helmut kohls governing 
coalition immediately attacked the proposal and heavy criticism 
was reported in east germany as well 
critics said a 21 rate exchanging two east german marks for 
every one west german mark would erode the life savings of 
elderly east germans and deny workers a chance to earn decent 
wages a 2to1 rate would mean that the salaries of east german 
workers would be sliced in half 
bundesbank chairman karl otto poehl announced the proposal in 
galway ireland where he was attending a meeting of economic 
community finance ministers he told reporters he had outlined the 
plan in a letter to kohl on thursday 
the monetary union is considered a crucial early step in the 
move toward german reunification some officials have predicted an 
economic merger by the summer 
the central bank proposal made an exception for small savers 
however it specifies that east german accounts up to 2000 marks 
per person the equivalent of about 1175 should be converted at 
a 11 rate 
the concession was made because of promises by kohl during the 
march 18 election campaign in east germany poehl said 
poehl argued that a 12 rate would in fact raise the value of 
the east german mark which currently is exchanged at the official 
east german rate of one west mark for three east marks however 
the currency is officially nonconvertible and in reality has 
little value outside the east bloc 
there had been speculation that too favorable a rate would fuel 
west german inflation but poehl predicted that east germans even 
with west german marks would be moderate in buying consumer goods 
west german finance theodor waigel who attended the meeting in 
ireland said he agreed with the bundesbank proposal 
kohl was asked about it while attending a meeting of his 
christian democratic union in neuss near duesseldorf he said only 
that he did not want to add to speculation about the exchange 
rate 
but the partys social committee chief ulf fink predicted that 
limiting the 11 exhange rate to 2000 marks would cause a new 
exodus of east germans to west germany 
another exodus would be more costly than a general 11 rate 
for all savings he was quoted by the neue osnabruecker zeitung 
newspaper as saying 
the flood of thousands of east germans westward played a big 
part in prompting reforms that ended communist rule in east 
germany however it put tremendous strains on west germany 
east germanys economy is a shambles and experts have predicted 
that billions of dollars must be invested annually for the next 
five to 10 years to modernize its industry transportation and 
other areas of the countrys infrastructure 
west germanys economy based on a freemarket system is the 
most powerful in the 12nation european community many of the west 
european currencies are closely tied to its mark 
in east berlin the official news agency adn said saturday that 
news of the central bank proposal had generated numerous complaint 
calls to the christian democratic union the west german unions 
sister party that won the march parliamentary elections the party 
campaigned for a quick monetary union to shore up east germanys 
economy 
however those calling the party offices saturday said they felt 
cheated after voting for the party on expectations of a 11 
exchange rate under monetary union adn said 
in bonn otto lambsdorff chairman of the junior governing 
coalition partner the free democratic party said that accepting 
the bundesbank proposal would be like breaking a promise made 
to the east germans 
in an interview with the weekly welt am sonntag newspaper in 
bonn lambsdorff said that because of very low retirement pay in 
east germany most elderly people there relied heavily on savings 
accumulated over the years 
lambsdorff was quoted by the newspaper as saying he also 
rejected an overall 11 exchange rate 
however he acknowledged that the free democrats and the 
christian democratic union favored that rate for most savings 
during the east german election campaign

a landslidedamaged petroleum pipeline sent 
an 8milelong slick down the allegheny river on saturday 
threatening water supplies for more than 100000 people 
authorities said 
fumes from the spill forced the evacuation of 100 people 
heavy rain friday apparently caused the landslide that cracked 
the pipeline the same day said ray haase jr of buckeye pipeline 
co 
about 75000 gallons of a 5050 mixture of diesel and heating 
oil leaked into knapp run creek then flowed into the allegheny 
about five miles north of freeport said haase the creek joins the 
allegheny about 30 miles north of pittsburgh 
monitors at buckeye pipelines allentown headquarters detected 
the leak around 11 pm friday when they noticed a loss of pressure 
in the 10inchwide pipe which runs from linden nj to the 
pittsburgh suburb of coraopolis haase said 
they cut off the flow of fuel about 20 minutes later it was 
unknown what time the leak began haase said 
there may have been delays he told an afternoon news 
conference its not always an instantaneous decision to shut a 
valve when the pressure drops 
water intakes in freeport were closed and residents were advised 
not to drink tap water said state department of environmental 
resources spokeswoman betsy mallison three tanker trucks brought 
potable water to the city of 3000 people saturday night 
water intake valves also were closed in south buffalo township 
harrison township brackenridge new kensington tarentum and 
oakmont the 101360 customers in those communities were being 
advised to conserve water ms mallison said 
i wouldnt do my laundry today she said 
a few miles southwest of oakmont the pittsburgh water 
department planned to close its intakes early sunday and rely on 
reserves for water for its 500000 customers said spokeswoman 
donna sagmeister 
she said the intakes could be reopened as early as sunday night 
and said no conservation order would be issued 
its not as serious as it could have been she said 
explaining that the fuel would have to pass over three locks and 
dams before reaching the city treatment plant that mixes it up 
thirty people from two cleanup companies hired by buckeye began 
cleaning up the spill at 4 am saturday state police said they 
set up booms along the allegheny where an oily film covered the 
shore at freeport on saturday night 
crews on docks in the city used absorbent pads to collect fuel 
but workers at the creek were hindered by mud from the landslide 
haase said 
its a nightmare up there he said theres about 200 
yards of road gone the landslide area is so unstable and saturated 
with oil its not physically possible for anyone to get in there 
fumes from the pads during the afternoon forced the evacuation 
of about 100 residents of a riverside apartment building for the 
elderly in freeport to a nearby elementary school mayor bob 
ravotti said 
at a news conference state fish commission officer jerry 
greiner displayed minnows and crayfish killed in the creek a 
popular fishing spot conservation officers were counting dead fish 
and trying to determine if birds were affected greiner said

american francis foecke on friday lost 
his latest bid to clear his name in a fouryear fight against 
charges that he cheated in his final student examination at bristol 
university 
but foecke 33 who comes originally from south bend ind said 
he intends to keep fighting 
if they think they are going to get away with it theyve got 
it wrong he said after the universitys governing council 
rejected his appeal 
foecke who pronounces his name faykey said he will consult his 
lawyers about taking the case to the law lords of the house of 
lords the highest court in the land 
the american reportedly has spent close to 200000 in legal 
fees and other costs contesting the universitys refusal to give 
him a degree in mathematics and computer science 
he lives with his british schoolteacher wife priscilla at 
clifton near the port city of bristol western england 
i will never throw in the towel even if i have to carry on the 
battle for the rest of my life i want my integrity back they have 
not a shred of real proof against me he said 
the university has destroyed my whole life professionally i 
want a huge amount of compensation as well as an apology and a 
degree 
the university refused to give him the degree in 1986 saying he 
must have cheated 
it said then that although he did firstclass work in the 
examination he had been a poor student up to that time it said 
his answers in two exam papers bore a remarkable resemblance to the 
examiners model answers including some of the mistakes 
university secretary michael parry said the council met for two 
hours and resolved to dismiss foeckes appeal after studying a 
100page report by an investigatory panel consisting of two 
professors 
the panel spent 16 days this year hearing foecke lawyers and 
staff at the university which has 7500 students 
foecke on friday dismissed the panels report as a load of 
garbage 
there were similarities to some of the model solutions in my 
answers that is because the university is too lazy to rewrite the 
exam papers sometimes the same questions crop up five years in a 
row he told reporters

retired army chief gen chavalit 
yongchaiyudh became deputy prime minister and defense minister 
friday in a controversial move that students and critics called a 
setback for thai democracy 
chavalit took up the new posts under a command issued by the 
countrys constitutional monarch king bhumibol adulyadej said 
state radio thailand monitored in bangkok 
chavalit retired tuesday as army commander in chief he was 
offered the cabinet posts by prime minister chatichai choonhavan 
who hopes chavalit will help shore up a government destablized by 
allegations of corruption inefficiency and labor disputes 
chatichai yielded his defense ministry portfolio to chavalit 
who also is now one of four deputy prime ministers 
radio thailand said the deputy army chief gen suchinda 
kraprayoon is the new army chief while the armed forces chief of 
staff gen sunthorn kongsompong takes on the post of acting 
supreme commander 
thailand has a long tradition of generals dominating politics 
but hopes for a new course were raised after chatichai in august 
1988 became the first prime minister in 12 years to also be an 
elected official 
chavalits moves to join the cabinet prompted the students 
federation of thailand to renew calls for a constitutional 
amendment requiring all ministers to be elected members of the 
parliament 
members of the federation staged a protest outside government 
house thursday holding up banners that called chavalit a 
destroyer of democratic culture and chastized him for jumping 
the queue to political power 
the thai media usually is timid in criticizing the military but 
the nation an independent englishlanguage newspaper stated its 
views in a hardhitting open letter to chavalit published thursday 
it said many people are suspicious of your motives is this 
your short cut to political power 
your going straight into the government will imply that either 
a top army commander can always demand a seat of political power 
almost at will or that an elected civilian government cannot 
survive without the support of the military or both neither of 
these bodes well for the political future of thailand 
chavalit was appointed army chief in 1986 when the thenprime 
minister prem tinsulanonda fired gen arthit kamlangek for 
publicly challenging the government

savings they contend they were steered into buying the uninsured 
bonds by lincoln and american continental employees who led them to 
believe the securities were as safe as a federally insured savings 
account

exhibit to the paperwork arguing that the lawsuits should be 
combined it was unsigned

a jury will begin deliberating next week 
whether john poindexter did his best to give congress the facts in 
the irancontra affair or engaged in what the prosecution called 
a rampage of destruction to cover up the scandal 
in closing arguments friday that followed three weeks of 
testimony prosecutor dan webb ridiculed the defense case and 
criticized former president reagans bias in favor of his onetime 
national security adviser 
poindexter destroyed a presidential document because it would 
have exposed his alleged lies to congress said webb in november 
1986 he said the document was the one piece of paper that puts 
the lie to reagans assertion then that there had been no trade 
of weapons to iran for american hostages in lebanon 
you dont lie to the american public webb said of reagans

the violently bad blood between greyhound lines 
inc and striking drivers reveals more than just a sense of worker 
desperation in a troubled moneylosing business 
it suggests the government has what amounts to a dualstandard 
on safety for passengers who can only afford to take the bus 
more than 200 incidents of violence have characterized the 
monthold strike against the nations only intercity bus service 
union and management both have deplored the violence which has 
frightened thousands of riders away and left others wondering 
whether theyll get shot bombed or harassed 
but federal officials havent done much to stop it except seek 
to restart contract talks 
that attitude contrasts sharply with the stand on safety taken 
by the government in other strikes where the public interest is 
affected perhaps the most notable recent example is the yearold 
walkout at eastern airlines 
when that strike started the transportation department warned 
it wouldnt tolerate illegal impediments to mass transit much less 
violence some lawmakers urged federal intervention to delay the 
strike fearing the impact on their constituents its not 
coincidental that most of the riders affected were business people 
commuters and vacationers along the affluent eastern seaboard 
the unions protested the limits on their picketing power but 
obeyed passengers waylaid by canceled flights found seats on 
competitors eastern now flies with nonstrikers and replacement 
workers 
greyhound riders on the other hand have little economic 
influence except perhaps on the balance sheet of the company the 
wayward interstate reststop concessions and the bus stop 
candynewspaper stands 
they are for the most part poor or lowincome cashpaying 
customers who cant pay the 120 for the 45minute northeast 
shuttle ride from new york to washington the 300 oneway ticket 
to chicago or the 198 roundtrip excursion fare to miami 
many are going to places the airlines dont even serve any more 
a result of the deregulation era that began more than a decade ago 
that has made greyhound the only public way to reach large swathes 
of americas heartland 
to some labormanagement experts that makes it seem even more 
incumbent on the government to guarantee the safety of greyhound 
riders some fault the transportation department for not taking a 
more aggressive stand 
i think the government position should have been stronger and 
more forthcoming in getting the parties back to the bargaining 
table said jerome rosow president of the work in america 
institute inc a consulting concern in scarsdale ny that 
specializes in labormanagement issues 
this is a public interest strike where transportation is 
affected said rosow an assistant secretary of labor from 
196971 theres a need to keep that flowing in terms of 
passenger traffic so it kind of appalled me as to why the 
government was allowing the strike to continue in the early days 
greyhound president fred currey has taken out fullpage ads in 
newspapers and ridden a few buses himself to at least symbolically 
demonstrate his concern over the passenger safety issue the 
drivers union historically accused by antiunion activists of 
promoting violence has called for prosecution of all 
strikerelated sabotage 
to some extent there is little the government can do to stop 
the violence because of the nature of the bus business itself 
putting police on every bus wouldnt deter people renegade 
strikers or uninvolved bad elements from lobbing rocks or taking 
sniper potshots from isolated overpasses on deserted highways 
even if the strike is settled the greyhound saga has aggravated 
a festering labormanagement dispute that many experts believe lies 
at the heart of the violence the right of employers to hire 
replacements for strikers 
although both sides agreed last thursday to resume talking the 
company has made its position clear on this issue 
the company cannot and will not abandon those who are helping 
it survive this senseless strike currey has said

most radio stations can hire and fire switch ad 
policies and conduct programming experiments without creating an 
uproar but not wfmt 
wfmt has friends and the friends of wfmt wont stand for any 
tinkering with the venerable fine arts station 
the friends are suing to protect wfmts international 
reputation says herbert kraus president of the 400member 
citizens group that was rebuffed in the first round of its court 
fight to prevent tampering with the stations unique character 
but the fm station may have to give up some traditions to 
survive say officials of wfmt whose owners are under fire for 
staff cutbacks a revised ad policy and alleged mismanagement 
wfmt which turns 40 next year has carved out a special niche 
in broadcasting 
the nations first radio superstation in the late 1970s 
wfmt is heard across the country and around the world through 
syndication and satellite relay 
it produces broadcasts of the chicago symphony orchestra the 
citys lyric opera and live performances elsewhere as well as 
instudio concerts talk shows and radio dramas it has won 
numerous awards including more peabody awards than any other 
station 
it also has a weekday talk show by studs terkel peabody and 
pulitzer prizewinning author and broadcaster whos been at the 
station for 27 years 
it is really the best fine artsclassical music station in the 
country probably in the western world said leon despres head 
of the friends legal team 
it never sacrificed quality it never used jingles for 
advertising it was just consistently interesting musically 
aesthetically you just arent bored by anything 
but wfmts not for everybody 
local columnist dennis byrne says you can search the world 
over and not find another station as stuffy 
why does wfmt find it necessary to bore its listeners with a 
saturday afternoon of news from the bbc byrne asked in the feb 
6 chicago suntimes what other station would find it more 
important to tell its morning listeners about a lute recital 
than expressway travel times 
even kraus concedes there are problems their share of the 
audience has gone down so they probably are doing some things 
wrong were just concerned about the general character 
maybe there should be more music and less talk he said a 
little stuffy that could be true also 
wfmts audience is aging and the station needs new listeners 
said alfred antlitz the stations general manager 
were taking something thats very good and saying we need to 
fix a few things to make it much stronger antlitz said 
wfmts programming goes beyond classical music to a fine arts 
mix that our core audience is intensely loyal to though it tends 
to turn off people who just want background music he said 
wfmt owned since 1969 by the chicago educational television 
association ceta which also owns local public television station 
wttw served for years as a model for commercial success in fine 
arts broadcasting 
but lately it has had trouble making ends meet antlitz said 
financial woes this year prompted the firing of eight of its 
more than 40 employees and a decision to accept prerecorded 
advertisements jingles to the friends for the first time in 
wfmt history 
it was the only station left in the country that didnt take 
canned commercials kraus said 
wfmt prefers announcerread ads but the policy cut into 
potential revenues antlitz said adding it was too soon to gauge 
the changes impact 
the friends fear too many changes will reduce wfmts audience 
and revenues prompting a decision to sell fine arts stations 
elsewhere klacfm in los angeles for example have been turned 
into more profitable rock stations kraus noted jazz stations also 
have been scuttled in recent years such as wrvr in new york 
wfmt supporters would try to buy the station if it went on the 
market despres said but 987 fm would be worth easily 25 
million as a commercial frequency 
the friends contend the stations financial problems began in 
1986 when ceta replaced its independent management 
antlitz said ceta just wants us to excel and live within 
our means 
the friends lost the first round of their court fight feb 6 
circuit judge albert green ruled they had no standing to file their 
lawsuit which contends the donation of the station to ceta by wgn 
continental broadcasting co made wfmt a charitable trust 
the 1969 gift agreement notes cetas plans to maintain the 
unique fine arts programming of the station for the benefit of the 
people of chicago 
green ruled that only the state attorney generals office could 
seek a trust designation but gave the friends a month to offer 
additional arguments 
despres said he was not optimistic and the group will appeal 
the lawsuit also contends wfmt was illegally deprived of 9 
million in profits from the 1986 sale of chicago magazine the 
slick lifestyle publication that began as wfmts program guide 
for 17 million 
antlitz said the money is in an endowment fund that can be 
tapped for capital improvements at wfmt 
were very much committed to the fine arts character of the 
station said ceta attorney richard j obrien jr but were 
committed to the stations economic survival as well 
the association denies the friends allegations he said

unself yourself replies a grand old man of 
english letters when asked for his advice to aspiring writers 
try for a moment to be the man you are listening to 
vs pritchett who will be 90 in december has spent a lifetime 
listening to other people and distilling their words into some of 
the finest fiction literary criticism and travel writing of the 
century 
he has published 40 books a new collection of his travel 
writing at home and abroad has just been published as well 
as a paperback of his biography of the russian writer anton chekhov 
honors have flowed from british and us universities including 
harvard a terrific one and im very proud of that he said 
in 1975 he was knighted for services to literature 
chekhovian is a description often applied to pritchetts 
deeply human gently ironic short stories novelist elizabeth bowen 
has called him the most important english practitioner of the short 
story the times of london said of his travel writing everywhere 
he slips unobtrusively into the life of the country and lets it 
speak for itself 
the author himself says of his travel writing i have 
generally liked all the people i have met in every country i did 
not say what i thought i did not reproach or criticize them i 
listened 
in his search for a character hell listen to anybody 
salesmen housewives cab drivers barflies barbers and 
bureaucrats i knew from my own relatives that such people have 
rich imaginations pritchett says 
a passion for walking has helped he never learned to drive and 
in his younger days he walked through france spain ireland north 
america 
he still likes a stroll through regents park near the modest 
home where he lives with his wife dorothy he writes in longhand 
honing his stories through half a dozen rewrites 
in the second volume of his autobiography midnight oil 
pritchett wrote that when he went to live in france 70 years ago 
it was the beginning of a passion for identifying myself with 
people who were not my own and whose lives were governed by ideas 
alien to mine 
victor sawdon pritchett had a chaotic boyhood his father was a 
disasterprone traveling salesman and the family skipped from home 
to home in the horsedrawn cabs of edwardian london to escape 
landlords and creditors thus he called the first volume of his 
autobiography a cab at the door 
it gave me a lifelong love of travel he says with a smile 
i wanted to be a writer my grandfather put it into my head when 
i was about 12 
from his mother he got the eye for detail that carries his 
stories along so artfully she wasnt a welleducated woman but 
she was a tremendous talker and could set a scene 
he left school at 15 wrote essays and accumulated rejection 
slips at 20 he moved to paris to work in the glue trade one 
weekend he set out to walk from paris to orleans his account got 
published in london magazines 
americans are very good at reading everything and when the 
editor of the christian science monitor visited paris he insisted 
on seeing me the monitor sent him to ireland where civil war 
was raging not to write about the war itself but about the state 
of the people 
in enniskillen he met a traveling salesman an undertakers son 
who made his rounds in his fathers hearse it fascinated me and 
when i wrote it i discovered i had a gift for dialogue and a 
feeling for common speech it made me famous overnight when it was 
published by john lehmann in new writing 
the story sense of humor tells of two lovers who are 
pestered by the womans jilted boyfriend when he kills himself on 
his motorbike while pursuing them they are offered a hearse for 
the journey home and drive off with the dead mans body in the back 
pritchett remembers being absolutely bowled over by his 
meeting the irish dramatist and poet william butler yeats in 
dublin he had a marvelous lofty manner floating high above the 
level of the ordinary world and he was very kind to any young man 
he made simply marvelous speeches to me on any subject that came 
into his head he was quite an actor in himself 
between the world wars he did a lot more walking 
i didnt want to see the big cities and normal life he 
says i wanted to see abnormal life i had heard about the poor 
whites in tennessee so i went to see them in the appalachians on 
the border with north carolina 
i found one village which was absolutely incredible because 
the people spoke a very strange english and a lot of them had names 
like those in elizabethan england they were all bible christians 
very very poor and very agreeable you only had to knock on a door 
and ask to stay the night and they would take you in and feed you 
i might sleep in one room with them grandparents parents and 
children in beds all around the room 
one old man of 93 told me his name was pritchett which is not 
so common he told me i fit fought in the civil war 
country people were always surprised to find an englishman on 
their doorstep it was the same along the spanish border with 
portugal when they asked what i did for a living i couldnt say i 
was a writer because they wouldnt have understood as they never 
saw a book as i carried a camera i said i made picture postcards 
and sold them they were so poor they didnt have beds they would 
say have you brought your sack and they would fill it with 
straw 
writing has taught pritchett to suppress his own feelings and be 
open to what other people say 
i said to myself i must observe this man and understand how 
he works why he works what his attitudes and feelings are 
i made a point of believing what i heard even though it was 
fantasy because it is part of a mans nature to have fantasies it 
has been said that too many of my characters are eccentric but they 
are not really they are people who are just speaking to 
themselves

before his first debate with susan molinari 
house candidate bob gigante received an unusual warning from his 
consultants whatever you do dont make her cry 
running against a woman can be a delicate business just ask 
george bush 
remember 1984 i cant forget it bush said recently of his 
vice presidential race against democrat geraldine ferraro 
the subject arose after clayton williams the republican nominee 
for texas governor said hed rather run against state attorney 
general jim mattox than state treasurer ann richards the two 
democrats are in a runoff april 10 
i wouldnt be as comfortable in battling with a woman 
williams said 
i know exactly what he means and i refuse to elaborate on 
it bush sympathized 
and no wonder the political landscape is strewn with faux pas 
by men mostly older ones more accustomed to thinking of women 
in the kitchen than on the campaign trail 
the men are nervous says democratic pollster celinda lake 
women running is just plain different and men sense it 
they are very confused adds republican pollster ann stone 
the rules have changed very quickly over the last 10 to 15 years 
youve got to kind of feel sorry for them maybe their hearts 
now in the right place but their mouths not there yet 
bush got himself in trouble six years ago when he boasted that 
he had kicked a little ass in a debate against ferraro the 
same race featured mississippi agriculture commissioner jim buck 
ross asking ferraro if she could bake blueberry muffins yes can 
you she replied 
a few years later men told women in wisconsin and new hampshire 
that they shouldnt be running for congress because they had young 
children one of the candidates sen gordon humphrey rnh 
later apologized and called his statement just plain stupid 
there are some things you just dont do i think you have to 
be a little bit more chivalric if thats the right word said 
california attorney general john van de kamp who is vying with 
former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein for the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination 
van de kamp offered only one specific he wouldnt punch his 
opponent in the nose but he still is taking a few swings at 
feinstein including an attack ad that ends dianne feinstein 
if she couldnt manage a city how could she manage california 
in contrast martha layne collins was elected governor of 
kentucky in 1983 in part because her opponents never could figure 
out how to run against her they never did point out anything wrong 
with her said democratic pollster harrison hickman 
lesson no 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like 
a candidate and talks like a candidate you treat it like a 
candidate added hickman whose clients include van de kamp and 
sen paul simon an illinois democrat trying to fend off a 
challenge by gop rep lynn martin 
women like martin and richards who have hired two of the 
hardesthitting media consultants in the business are making it 
easier for men to attack by proving that they can be as aggressive 
as the next guy 
they also are coming up with some deft responses to 
genderrelated missteps 
ferraros goodnatured comeback to rosss blueberry muffin 
question was considered ideal richards came up with a good 
oneliner after williams a selfstyled symbol of the 
freewheeling bootwearing texan confessed he wouldnt relish 
running against her even cowboys get the blues she said 
williams 58 has been even bluer since he compared the bad 
weather at his ranch last month to a rape if its inevitable 
just relax and enjoy it he said the incident created a furor 
and williams eventually apologized from the bottom of my heart 
stone attributes williams remarks both on rape and running 
against women to his generation and upbringing in texas his 
lexicon hasnt caught up with the times yet she said 
but while men of williams age may not be used to competing with 
women many younger candidates like gigante 41 consider it 
routine the new york democrat who has four children and a working 
wife was surprised by his coaches advice to be tough on molinari 
without making her cry 
why would she cry gigante asked shes a mature woman 
shes held office she wasnt going to cry when i attacked her on 
an issue just like i wasnt going to cry if she attacked me 
for the record molinari did not cry she won the election and 
was sworn in last week as a republican congresswoman from staten 
island

the government has established three separate 
agencies to persuade people to get married the function in most 
other places of matchmakers aunts and neighborhood busybodies 
the latest is the social promotion section which organizes 
social activities where school dropouts aged 2035 can meet about 
150000 of singapores 26 million people are in that category 
i have to mix around with members and help them break the ice 
between them with my personality said david chua 35 head of 
the new agency 
i want to make them talk to each other i have to see myself 
as a matchmaker i cant just sit back and watch hoping they will 
fall in love 
his agency plans to sponsor dances barbecues group travel and 
courses in personal development 
it joins the social development unit created by dr eileen aw 
in 1984 for single college graduates and the social development 
section run by sam tan which was formed the next year to promote 
marriage among high school graduates 
early skeptics described the social development unit as a 
bureaucratic lonely hearts club for the single desperate and 
ugly with the resources of the ministry of finance behind it 
however the organization made steady progress in singapores 
conservative society 
a declining birthrate and charges of elitism prompted the 
government to widen a matchmaking program that originally served 
only civil servants with university degrees critics say it still 
smacks of of discrimination since the groups served are segregated 
by educational qualifications 
about 9700 members belong to the original agency and it claims 
credit for more than 570 marriages 
at the end of last year the social development section for high 
school graduates had 48000 members and more than 7280 former 
members had married 
married women were caught trying to sneak into that group so 
the new social promotion section will check up on applicants 
the government created the first of its matchmaking bureaus 
after prime minister lee kuan yew said in 1983 that singapore might 
be doomed by a deteriorating talent pool because too many educated 
women remained single and childless 
levels of competence will decline he declared our 
economy will falter the administration will suffer and society 
will decline 
part of the problem was that singapores men preferred to marry 
women less educated than they while women wanted to marry upward 
said goh chok tong the first deputy prime minister 
male college graduates had no difficulty finding wives but 
those with less education remained unmarried he said 
the more educated our people become the fewer people they 
want goh said singapores birth rate has trailed the death rate 
since 1974 
in 1987 the government reversed itself on a successful birth 
control program it now encourages families to have three or more 
children if they can afford it 
a tax rebate of 20000 10695 us is promised to couples 
who have a second child before the mother is 28 similar 
procreation incentives are offered for third and fourth 
children 
tax incentives cannot be taken by themselves said dr paul 
cheung director of the population planning unit the support 
infrastructure must also be provided to lessen the burden of child 
rearing 
he said the number of government child care centers had 
increased to 12330 from the 6086 of early 1987

the financial wars may have produced no decisive 
outcome yet in 1990 but they already have racked up an imposing 
casualty list 
as the first quarter of the year came to a close last week the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials hovered in the low to 
mid2700s right around where it stood at new years 
to describe the januarymarch period as uneventful however 
required a very short memory 
you had to overlook among other things the abrupt collapse of 
a prominent brokerage firm a sharp decline in the supposedly 
unshakeable japanese stock market and some serious disturbances as 
well in the worlds of real estate and banking 
under the circumstances some observers argued the big news 
about us stocks wasnt that they seemed to be napping but rather 
that they hadnt fallen out of bed 
one icon of the 1980s was smashed in february when drexel 
burnham lambert inc the architect and prime tenant of the 
junkbond market disappeared from the scene 
another was battered when the tokyo stock market took a tumble 
reminiscent of the 1987 crash 
a painful reappraisal also continued for residential real estate 
and other properties in some parts of the country where home prices 
had been rising for most of the past three decades 
the real estate correction has dealt a new setback to the 
banking industry even as the financial system was struggling to 
rebound from a series of other disruptions 
regional banking stocks accounted for several of the first 
quarters biggest losers among individual issues traded on the new 
york stock exchange 
in a tabulation of stock performance for the year through the 
middle of last week bank of new england crossland savings 
american savings bank of new york and unionfed financial showed 
losses exceeding 35 percent 
the woes of japanese stocks meanwhile raised new questions 
about the vogue for international investing that made 
singlecountry funds so popular in the late 1980s 
country funds that recorded declines of 30 percent or more 
included the spain fund austria fund korea fund thai fund and 
taiwan fund 
while stars like those were fading traders found some 
opportunities for profit in outoffavor blue chips 
international business machines was up 15 percent and general 
motors 13 percent to rank among the best performing components of 
the dow jones industrial average in a midmarch tally by william 
lefevre an analyst at advest inc 
another of the dows winners was navistar whose price of around 
4 ranks it as by far the lowestpriced stock in the average it 
was helped by conjecture about a possible improvement in the 
depressed truck manufacturing business

digital audio tape recording the home taping 
enthusiasts dream and the music industrys worst nightmare 
finally is here 
with a protracted legal battle over this latest advance in 
highend recording potentially resolved manufacturers are 
promising to roll out their consumer dat machines by summer nearly 
three years later than first expected 
the recording industry aware of statistics showing that four 
out of 10 people over the age of 10 have taped recorded music in 
the past year is holding its breath in dat the big guns in the 
hardware industry are unleashing a product that threatens to do to 
the humble audiocassette what tapes and fancy compact discs did to 
the oncemighty vinyl lp 
it has the potential of doing what cd did in its initial 
introduction into the marketplace or about 35000 units in the 
first year said paul foschino assistant general manager of 
technics the secaucus njbased arm of japans matushita 
electric corp 
matushita plans to introduce a dat recorder in the united states 
under the technics label this summer at a cost of about 1200 to 
1300 foschino said the machines will carry a panasonic label in 
europe and japan 
philips consumer electronics plans to introduce a dat machine 
this year and it also is developing a cassette that could be 
played on both digital equipment and the analog cassette machines 
already in use according to the trade publication audio week 
how well the pricey dat machines fare with consumers is an open 
question but some analysts predict that like cd players the 
prices will come down sharply when the new format gains popularity 
a disturbing blip on the horizon for dat manufacturers however 
is the prospect of recordableerasable cds which tandy corp for 
one is developing 
the imminent arrival of these digital technologies has revived 
the debate over home taping and whether artists should be 
reimbursed for potential lost sales the money most likely would 
come from royalty fees on blank tapes or recorders 
a recent study by the congressional office of technology 
assessment said home taping may be causing as much as a 22 percent 
loss in prerecorded music sales ota said its survey in fall 1988 
showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped recorded music in 
the previous year 
songwriters composers and music publishers claim that with dat 
theyll lose even more royalties as listeners make virtually 
perfect tape copies of their favorite compact discs 
but a bill pending in congress to limit the number of copies 
that dat machines can make has eased concerns of record 
manufacturers and cleared the way for introduction of the machines 
the bill codifies an agreement reached last summer in athens 
between the recording and manufacturing industries 
although the bill by rep henry waxman dcalif does not 
address the royalties question the record industry considers the 
measure to be a major step forward 
david leibowitz senior vice presidentgeneral counsel of the 
recording industry association of america says the group remains 
very committed to royalties 
however we dont believe that royalties are politically 
achievable at the present time which is why we felt that we should 
at least secure some protection he said 
but the artists who create the songs arent satisfied they 
question whether or not the new anticopying technology is 
tamperproof and say that even limited copying cuts into their 
business and will lead ultimately to fewer recordings being made 
we want the technology to move forward but the question is 
will it allow us to make a living and will consumers have product 
available said ed murphy president of the national music 
publishers association 
opponents of fees on blank dat tapes or recorders claim such a 
royalty system would be unfair to those who dont use the tapes to 
record music 
if you want to tape your childs first words why should you 
pay michael jackson for that said ed baxter chief counsel to 
the senate judiciary patents copyrights and trademarks 
subcommittee 
it is still uncertain how the dat bill will fare this year in 
the house in a session shortened by electionyear politicking and a 
major clean air bill that is tying up the energy and commerce 
committee where the bill resides 
i dont think its a terribly controversial issue but its 
just a question of whether theres enough time said one 
congressional aide who would not allow his name to be used 
to the recording industry the scary part about dat which uses 
the 1s and 0s of computer language to make exact duplicates of the 
source material is that as many as 20 generations of digital 
copies can be made without discernible loss of quality 
faced with the threat of runaway home copying which copyright 
law generally has declared to be legal personal use the riaa 
in 1987 threatened to sue any manufacturer that introduced a 
consumer dat model before copyright issues could be addressed 
the athens agreement settled the legal question for now by 
instituting the serial copy management system scms will allow one 
dat copy to be made from a copyrighted cd but the user cannot make 
a copy from the dat copy it would allow a cd to be copied 
indefinitely onto different blank dat tapes 
the system also limits to two the number of generations of 
copies that can be made from a nondigital source such as todays 
analog audiocassettes lps or radio broadcasts one copy of a 
copy could be made from analog sources 
scms uses a silicon chip that will be able to detect an 
electronic antipiracy flag that is placed on a copyrighted 
digital material such as music cds the chip will write this 
flag onto the first dat copy made from the cd if a dat recorder 
detects this flag its record function will not operate 
professional dat machines without scms already are in use in 
the united states in the recording broadcast and computer 
industries at hefty prices ranging from 2500 to 7000 gray 
market consumer models can be had for 1600 to 3000 
automobile dat players have been available for more than a year at 
1500 and up with some prerecorded dat tapes mostly classical 
and jazz available at about 25 
dat tapes which are about half the size of conventional 
audiocassettes can store as much as two encyclopedias worth of 
data much more than conventional cartridges used for backup 
computer storage dat tapes could be useful as backups to hard 
discs on personal computers 
dat machines work something like a typical videocassette 
recorder a mechanism inside the dat machine opens a door on the 
back of the dat cassette and draws the 13inchwide tape around a 
spinning recordplay drum the recording is accomplished at the 
dizzying speed of 123 inches per second 65 times faster than 
todays audiocassette deck

theres still life left in 70 girls 70 a 
starcrossed broadway musical 
a charming song and dance about a group of old theater folk who 
steal furs to save their apartment hotel the musical opened in 
april 1971 and barely lasted one month now nearly 20 years after 
its new york premiere 70 girls 70 is getting a second 
chance 
in february a revised version opened in sarasota fla as part 
of the inaugural season at the opulent new asolo center for the 
performing arts it runs there through april 11 
in july the show will be done at the chichester festival in 
england with british musicalcomedy star dora bryan in the role 
originally played on broadway by mildred natwick other american 
regional theaters have also expressed interest 
the original production had more than its share of problems it 
went through several writers and a director or two 
but there were other factors that contributed to its short run 
the show faced stiff competition that season from more highpowered 
musicals with similiar themes such as follies and from no 
no nanette and two by two which also featured older stars 
and most importantly its leading man suffered a heart attack and 
died during a tryout performance in philadelphia 70 girls 70 
never fully recovered 
i guess every time you fail you like to give it another 
shot said fred ebb who wrote the shows lyrics and collaborated 
on the original book you wish six strikes were out instead of 
three i always harbored a notion to do 70 girls 70 again 
over the years ebb and his partner composer john kander the 
men who wrote carbaret chicago and the upcoming kiss of 
the spider woman have been asked by regional theaters for rights 
to the show 
we were reluctant to do it in the original way since that had 
proven unsuccessful ebb said 
they called on david thompson a young writer who had redone the 
book for flora the red menace another kander and ebb musical 
that resurfaced successfully at the tiny vineyard theater in new 
york and the pasadena playhouse in california 
the changes between 1971 and 1990 in 70 girls 70 were 
mostly in the structure of the show ebb said rearranging story 
and songs the lead character ida became the narrator who 
clarifies the story line and introduces the audience to the various 
characters 
the problem with 70 girls 70 which im sure will be 
constant if were lucky enough to have further productions is 
always in the casting ebb said its very hard to get people 
of the correct age to play this and particularly if its far away 
from their homes if its eight performances a week and if its for 
an extended period of time 
eddie foy jr was to be have been in the original production 
and we were rehearsing in the winter he was staying at the lambs 
club between walking to the theater where we were rehearsing and 
the lambs he would almost get frostbite he was chilled to the 
bone he said fellas i cant do this anymore he would have 
been wonderful 
more devastating was the death on stage in philadelphia of david 
burns the veteran comic actor who had appeared in such shows as 
the music man and hello dolly 
davey died during a scene where everybody on stage is trying 
to act old and a little crazy ebb recalled in fact he was 
having a heart attack it seemed part of the show he fell to the 
floor and it got a laugh it was right in keeping with the style 
of that particular scene 
stagehands came in and dragged him off the audience didnt 
even notice he died in the wings it was an awful experience we 
all just sat around and cried for a couple of hours 
davey was much beloved by the company and i think what 
happened frightened many of our performers of the same age to see 
someone they were friends with and were working with just die in 
front of them was terrible 
after burns death the show had to cut short its engagement in 
philadelphia where it had received very good notices and was doing 
very good business 
we couldnt afford to stay there because we had to come to new 
york and find a replacement ebb said 
in new york the musical opened less than two weeks after 
follies the landmark stephen sondheim musical that received an 
enormous amount of attention 
in many ways follies was about elderly people too or at 
least middleaged ones coming to identity crises and how they dealt 
with it ebb said follies was opulent and beautiful and 
very very expensive we were like a little show that has banged 
together out of spit good will and nails i dont think that 
comparison helped us very much either 
the score preserved on the columbia original cast album always 
has been a favorite among theater buffs and at least two of its 
songs yes championed by liza minnelli and coffee in a 
cardboard cup done by mandy patinkin have had a popularity 
outside the show 
the chichester production will be directed by paul kerryson who 
staged the first british production of the rink kander and 
ebbs last broadway show but he will have an american eye looking 
over his shoulder ed aldridge who was the stage manager on the 
original production of 70 girls 70 will travel to england to 
consult on the show

as they look for potential winners in the 
international investment derby of the early 1990s some analysts 
are touting a recent alsoran by the name of the united states 
the idea isnt exactly a novel one given the sheer size of the 
us economy and its powerful influence on world politics 
but it still represents something of a switch from the trend in 
recent years when investment funds in search of the most glamorous 
growth opportunities often headed for other points around the globe 
until fairly recently the most obvious magnet for money was 
japan and its pacific rim neighbors 
then the rush was on to european markets encouraged by the 
toppling of longtime cold war barriers and the prospect of a new 
economic order in 1992 
if you were in a mood to pick long shots many experts looked 
toward businesses in smaller industrialized countries or the third 
world 
when big players operating on a global scale contemplated us 
investments they most often thought in terms of safety stability 
and liquidity rather than a chance at a big score 
american merchandise meant treasury bills bonds and notes 
still regarded as one of the safest highyielding investments 
available anywhere and bluechip stocks 
in a new decade however some observers argue that events may 
be conspiring to put some glamor back into the image of the 
american markets on the computer screens of trading rooms around 
the world 
japan for its part has seen a wrenching decline in its markets 
amid worries over high interest rates and even higher 
priceearnings ratios 
there are signs as well that stocks in west german and other 
european markets may be undergoing at least a temporary setback 
after soaring on heady expectations there 
developments that cast a shadow of doubt over western europe 
could make the united states the ray of sunshine in a world 
darkened by uncertainty says greg smith analyst at 
prudentialbache securities 
even if the united states does nothing particularly clever 
but simply continues to be viewed as a place of predictable ongoing 
opportunity the us market could become the hot spot later this 
year by default 
american stocks staged a modest advance in the past week 
closing out a generally inconclusive first quarter of 1990 the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials rose 293 to 270721 cutting its 
loss to 4599 points since new years 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 140 at 18685 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market down 171 at 43554 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 014 at 36175 
volume on the big board averaged 13231 million shares a day 
against 15172 million the week before 
over the past couple of months many analysts have been impressed 
with the steady showing of us stocks while the japanese market 
tumbled but not everyone is ready just yet to declare this a clear 
victory for bulls on the united states 
japan inc probably the greatest cartel of the postwar world 
is falling apart and the ramifications both good and bad are 
unknowable said barton biggs at morgan stanley amp co in the 
short run some of the ripples may turn into waves that swamp some 
innocent boats 
added david resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international inc the wealth lost in the plunge in japanese 
share prices is so mindbogglingly large that it is easy to fret 
over a potential spillover into other markets 
consider this the more than 20 percent drop since the 
beginning of the year has erased something on the order of 800 
billion to 900 billion of wealth from that market thats roughly 
double the wealth lost in the us markets during the october 1987 
crash

the question is simple it wouldnt stump a 
child but for the people in this bright room nothing is simple 
what do you call two pieces of bread with something in 
between the therapist asks eight mostly young adults 
a young woman eagerly raises her hand a sandwich she 
answers 
nearby another therapist holds a piece of white cardboard with 
the word january written in large black letters in front of a 
young man in a wheelchair his head is slumped forward as if he 
were dozing 
in a large dining room sam been sits at a baby grand piano 
playing one of the tunes he composed during 18 months at the new 
medico rehabilitation and skilled nursing center which specializes 
in the treatment of head injury victims 
been and the others at new medicos troy facility are among tens 
of thousands of americans who each year suffer debilitating head 
injuries many will need specialized care and rehabilitation the 
rest of their lives 
the federal department of health and human services in 1988 
established a task force to address the needs of people with head 
injuries the task force found most medical legal and social 
systems illequipped to deal with victims of traumatic brain injury 
and its report issued last year said the medical and legal 
costs and related economic losses for head injury victims approach 
25 billion per year 
among the task forces recommendations to the house and senate 
appropriations committees were encouraging the establishment of 
state and local head injury groups to provide leadership and 
coordination and creation of a national network of regional head 
injury research centers 
some of the recommendations are being followed for example 
westchester county medical center is establishing a regional head 
injury care manager program to coordinate services 
the national head injury foundation calls head trauma a silent 
epidemic 
jerry lewis isnt out there pushing for head injury 
children said dr samuel kasoff chairman of the neurosurgery 
department at westchester county medical center in valhalla 
the foundation estimates that more than a million people suffer 
some degree of head trauma each year some 100000 die from their 
injuries of those that survive 70000 to 90000 are left with 
impairments that prevent them from living normal lives 
motor vehicle accidents account for more than half the head 
injuries according to the nhif twenty percent are caused by 
falls 12 percent by violence and 10 percent are suffered during 
sports or recreation activities 
increased use of helmets and seat belts and better emergency 
medical treatment have resulted in more people surviving head 
injuries said trauma surgeon john b fortune 
were a mechanized mobile society we go very fast and get 
into accidents unfortunately one of the organs that gets injured 
a lot is the head said fortune director of the northeastern new 
york regional trauma center at albany medical center hospital 
with more survivors demand grew in the 1980s for rehabilitation 
ten years ago when we were formed there were about five rehab 
facilities like new medico now there are about 600 said silvana 
guercilena spokeswoman for the nhif a southborough massbased 
advocacy group 
for victims of severe head injury rehabilitation can be long 
and painful with no guarantees 
when been arrived at new medico on sept 1 1988 six weeks 
after a car accident he could not walk or talk he suffered memory 
loss and became easily distracted and agitated common symptoms of 
traumatic brain injury 
theres parts of my life i dont remember he said its 
hard i used to cry a lot then i make the best of what it is and 
say thanks lets go on 
about 50 head injury patients ages 16 and older occupy new 
medicos two floors said spokeswoman kathryn rockenstire a nearby 
center opened in 1989 and specializes in treating children 
with 38 facilities nationwide new medico is the nations 
largest provider of head injury rehabilitation costs start at 375 
per day and go as high as 950 per day depending on the extent of 
the rehab program considering the average stay at new medico is 
seven months the total could reach 199500 
a lot of people cant even get into these facilities because 
their insurance doesnt cover them to be there said guercilena 
their insurance covers them to be in a nursing home for the rest 
of their lives 
there are less expensive facilities new medicos rehab centers 
stress gracious living rockenstire said at troy english 
hunting prints and oriental art decorate the walls visitors sit in 
thick leather chairs and sofas in the lobby in a lounge decorated 
with queen anne furniture coffee is offered from a silver serving 
set 
new medicos philosophy to give it a home atmosphere not an 
institution rockenstire said we want this to be a place where 
family members can feel comfortable 
the goal of head injury rehabilitation is to get the patient 
back home back to work and contributing to society though he was 
looking forward to going home been kept his excitement in check 
he knows the bitterness of setbacks 
been whose insurance paid for his new medico stay was 
discharged last month and has returned home to the bronx with his 
wife rockenstire said he has the potential to return to work but 
will need retraining and rehabilitation she said 
before the accident been was a 24yearold security guard none 
of the three other people in the car suffered a scratch 
i didnt even break a nail been said i said to my wife 
later honey didnt i even break something 
five months after he arrived at new medico been was walking 
and uses a crutch he is expected to be able to discard one day but 
like most head injury victims there are memories that are lost to 
him possibly forever 
an avid guitar player before the accident been found he could 
no longer play because of neurological damage to his brain like 
many head trauma victims beens brain messages misfire 
causing muscle spasticity or contraction that can severely twist 
limbs without therapy and braces 
been turned to the piano partly to relieve boredom and also 
because the physical coordination and concentration needed to play 
proved to be good therapy 
been played for some cub scouts his first christmas at new 
medico and they returned last christmas wondering if he would play 
again 
i was like christmas humbug been said i was here i 
wanna get out of here 
so they came and they touched my heart they touched my heart 
so gently he said smiling then they had me saying hey

the downgrading of new york states longterm 
credit rating has shown that the problem of deteriorating credit 
quality isnt confined to the muchmaligned junk bond market 
citing concerns about stalled negotiations to close a widening 
budget deficit standard amp poors corp last week dropped its 
rating on the states longterm general obligation bonds by two 
notches to singlea it also gave a lower rating to a new state 
shortterm financing 
the move left new york with the thirdlowest rating among the 
states ahead only of lowly louisiana and massachusetts 
the longterm downgrade applied only to 39 billion in bonds 
outstanding but the move carried big implications for the 700 
billion municipal bond market 
about 10 percent of the outstanding bonds in the market come 
from new york or various municipalities school districts and other 
entities in the state including new york city most of those 
entities depend on the state for a large portion of their revenues 
so cuts in the state budget could hit them hard 
even if theres some modest adjustment every school district 
in the state theoretically could be affected said bob 
chamberlain head of municipal research at dean witter reynolds inc 
the downgrade didnt have a big initial impact because the 
states problems including a recession in its key financial 
services industry and sluggishness in tax receipts have been 
increasingly evident in recent months 
theres been a downtrend over the past six to eight to 10 
months says neal atterman director of municipal research at 
kidder peabody amp co 
still the rating change forced the state to pay about 10 basis 
points more in yield to sell 775 million in tax and revenue 
anticipation notes to help close its budget gap estimates mike 
delaney a partner in the municipal bond department at goldman 
sachs amp co the firm underwrote nearly half last weeks issue 
the budget pressures facing new york are intensifying across the 
northeast where sluggish economic growth and a weak real estate 
market are crimping state revenue growth 
lawmakers in massachusetts have been struggling to get the 
states finances in order for more than a year standard amp poors 
recently lowered its ratings on connecticuts longterm debt by one 
notch to doublea because of recurring budgetary problems 
hyman grossman managing director in charge of municipals at 
sampp says weakness in the economy has led to shortfalls in personal 
income tax and corporate tax receipts in new york 
his suggestion a 10 percent income tax surcharge that would 
raise about 15 billion perhaps enough to close the budget gap 
for the year that began sunday thats tough medicine in these 
political times 
but grossman says when it comes to basic fiscal integrity 
politics has to be shunted aside 
george leung managing director of state ratings at moodys 
investors service inc says that while the states economy causes 
some underlying concerns the main problem now is getting new 
yorks legislative leaders and gov mario cuomo to agree on real 
measures to cut the deficit 
theres certainly an ability here they just have to deal with 
the problem he said 
although most attention has focused on the northeasts problems 
less severe cash shortages are evident elsewhere including 
southeast states like florida georgia and tennessee says atterman 
of kidder peabody 
many states are suffering from changes in federal government 
policy in recent years that have imposed increased spending 
requirements on the states while reducing federal aid at the same 
time 
the number of states and the variety of states that are 
either expecting a deficit or are having cash difficulties is 
rather startling he sas 
i think very gradually theres been some concern about a 
worsening of credit quality in the municipal market generally says 
delaney of goldman sachs you saw it in the junk market you saw 
it in the corporate market and youre seeing it in the municipal 
market 
the deterioration hasnt pushed up bond yields that much to date 
because of a dearth in the volume of new issues atterman says the 
pace of new issues is off about 20 percent so far this year in 
large part because a rise in interest rates generally has 
discouraged some potential borrowers 
nevertheless if and when we do see more volume in the market 
were going to see increased differentiation in yields between 
different credit risks he says

when natural gas futures begin trading for the first time ever 
on tuesday the focus will be on the trading pit at the new york 
mercantile exchange but the ceremony will be in the cajun prairie 
town of erath 
nymex chose sabine pipe line companys gas interchange center 
south of lafayette in the louisiana bayous as the designated 
delivery site for all futures contracts 
the first contract was to be delivered to sabines facility in 
the town of 2100 during tuesday ceremonies attended by officials 
of nymex and sabine a subsidiary of texaco 
the erath facility is a pipeline that transports gas from 
louisiana texas and the outer continental shelf in the gulf of 
mexico 
louisiana is the leading natural gas producer in the continental 
united states and a majority of the states large pipelines pass 
through the jungle of pipes at erath 
the selection of louisiana as the futures delivery point 
affirms louisianas role as a leader in the natural gas field 
said gov buddy roemer 
natural gas producers hope the move will have the same kind of 
effect on the industry as oil futures trading did once it began in 
1978 since then nymex trading largely has fixed the price of oil 
even in the face pricesetting strategies by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
the oil industry has benefited from futures trading and the 
gas people are hoping for the same thing said ron gomez 
secretary of the louisiana department of natural resources 
a futures contract is an obligation to buy or sell a prescribed 
quantity of goods to be delivered at a future date at a price 
agreed upon in advance 
both producers and consumers use futures as a hedge against 
fluctuating prices buying or selling them to lock in the prices at 
which they buy or sell raw goods eliminating some of their 
financial risk 
it can work the same way for gas said vic tompkins of the 
louisiana mineral resources division but remember the futures 
market involves a lot of gambling the pit can be like a casino 
in addition to those wanting to hedge against price 
fluctuations futures attract speculators who buy contracts 
essentially to gamble on future price movements 
the trading of natural gas futures which first was proposed to 
the commodity futures trading commission in 1984 reflects the 
enormous growth in the spot market for natural gas as federal price 
controls have been lifted 
deregulation of the natural gas market began in 1978 and 
remaining price controls will be lifted by 1993 
nachamah jacobovits of nymex said the exchange doesnt expect as 
much speculative dealing in gas as there is in oil thats why 
sabine is excited about its henry hub center in erath 
the contract with nymex will assist sabine in achieving its 
goal of making the henry hub the premier location for trading 
natural gas in the united states said jagjit s yadav of 
houston president of the pipeline company 
we believe that futures contract trading will encourage the 
development of a more efficient natural gas market and be of 
benefit to the natural gas industry and its customers he said

products that claim to be degradable 
recyclable dioxinfree phosphate free and ozonefriendly now span 
everything from toilet paper to baby food available everywhere 
from mail catalogs to walmart shelves 
but as mobil corp and other manufacturers have discovered 
shrewd environmentalists and government regulators are starting to 
do something about what they see as healthyplanet hype 
mobil announced this past week it was deleting the word 
degradable from labels on its hefty trash bags the company 
took the action because of what it called growing confusion about 
what degradable means 
bils decision came after a task force of 
attorneys general disclosed it was investigating mobi nonetheless mol 
and several 
consumer products companies over allegations of misleading 
advertising 
the investigation stemmed partly from concern raised by the 
environmental defense fund and other activist groups that 
wellmeaning consumers are buying products falsely touted as 
environmentally safe 
in the case of hefty bags mobil had claimed that a chemical 
additive accelerated the bags decomposition when exposed to 
sunlight in landfills but because most bags are buriedr 
image problems in the united states by making corporate charitable 
donations and hiring lobbyists to represent them in washington 
now in response to accusations that tokyo has been buying support 
from us officials and academics some japanese protest what they 
call a japanlobby hunt reminiscent of anticommunist campaigns
