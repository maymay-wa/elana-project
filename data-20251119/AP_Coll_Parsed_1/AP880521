rescuers used a helicopter friday to lift 
the bodies of three climbers from the snowy face of mount ranier 
bringing the death toll on the mountain described as everest 
on a minature scale to 54 in the last 90 years 
the three bodies recovered at the 10000foot level of the 
14410foot mountain were identified as those of craig loyal 
adkison 37 of kirkland david kellokoski 30 of tahoeparadise 
calif and greg remmick 32 of citrus heights calif said 
pierce county coroners spokesman stewart rankin 
the three described as experienced climbers began their trek 
may 9 and were supposed to have completed it last saturday a 
search was begun tuesday and the bodies still roped together 
were spotted from the air thursday 
since 1981 nine people including the three latest victims 
have died on the steep and strenuous liberty ridge on the north 
face of rainier a dormant volcano 
cy hentges mount rainier national park spokesman said the 
ridges appeal has increased since its inclusion in a 1979 book on 
classic north american climbs prior to 1981 there were no 
reported deaths on the ridge 
but the entire mountain is something to be reckoned with 
hentges said 
the american everest team trained on it hentges said 
that should tell you something its on a miniature scale but it 
provides anything and everything that everest does except its not 
that high 
you can walk up sometimes roped with proper equipment but in 
shorts but all it takes is one storm to come in and this has 
happened many times to kill people 
it looks so lovely and so beautiful and yet it can be a devil 
that shows pity on no one he said 
hentges said it was likely the adkison kellokoski and remmick 
hit bad weather and unstable fresh snow and fell 2000 feet to 
their deaths in an avalanche 
because of continued avalanche danger the helicopter did not 
land near the bodies but snagged the rope still connecting them 
lifted them and flew to a safer spot where they could be loaded and 
flown off the mountain 
edward cabelera owner of an exercise equipment company that 
remmick worked for said that not long before his friend left on 
the climb i asked him why he wasnt going on a guided trip he 
told me he didnt want anybody to hold his hand 
if i dont make it thats the way i want to go thats the 
last thing he told me cabelera said 
ironically rangers said the latest deaths will probably 
attract more climbers 
news like this tends to bring more people to the mountain 
chief park ranger bill jensen said its a very dangerous 
hazardous route and thats what attracts people the thrill of 
danger 
about 8000 people attempt to climb rainier each year most of 
them up the south side and about half of them make it

a beached baby whale who had followed his 
dying mother onto a north carolina beach has died at sea world 
where officials blamed stress undernourishment and dehydration 
the complications causing the 5foot pygmy sperm whales death 
friday are common symptoms among stranded marine mammals said 
daniel odell research biologist at the orlando tourist 
attractionresearch center where the whale was taken thursday 
tests showed it was on the verge of kidney failure and other 
things it was a very sick little whale said odell who had not 
expected the 140pound animal to survive 
historically baby whales who beach themselves die within days 
one lasted a month at sea world last year older ones survive a 
little longer odell said 
the baby whale dubbed sophia by its rescuers near wilmington 
nc before it was found to be a male beached itself with its 
mother the mother was dying when they were discovered and 
veterinarians killed it 
odell said the usual reason for adult whale beachings is 
congestive heart failure

ticket scalpers familiar outside rock 
concerts and sports events have invaded unlikely turf a dance for 
middleschool students 
the dance scheduled for friday night was canceled after the 
vernon junior womens club discovered that the 3 tickets were 
being sold for as much as 10 apiece by student scalpers 
the league sponsors dances with the parks and recreation 
department a limited number of tickets are sold because the dances 
are held in a gym that can accommodate only 250 people there are 
about 1100 middleschool students in town 
that situation led to students duplicating tickets and now 
selling them at inflated prices club president peggy jackle said 
she said she hopes the cancellation of the dance will serve as 
notice to the scalpers that the future of the dances depends on 
their conduct

as angelo abbate addressed a golf 
ball with a nineiron at hollywood lakes country club a herd of 13 
buffalo addressed him with wideeyed stares 
i got kind of scared there for a second said abbate 73 
who blames his bogey on the bison 
buffalo have roamed broward and dade counties for two months 
after a horse thief inadvertently freed 250 of them from a ranch 
since then they have surprised motorists on interstate 75 hung 
around farmers fields and even grazed on the greens at golf 
courses last week a buffalo died after it was hit by a 
tractortrailer in dade 
state troopers and wildlife officers say the buffalo problem is 
getting out of hand 
it is just a question of time before someone is going to get 
hurt said cattle farmer george williams what they need to do 
is catch them in a steel pen that can hold them once and for all 
officers from the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
rounded up the bison at the golf course wednesday and put them 
inside a barbed wire fence on williams nearby pasture 
but the freespirited buffalo broke through the fence thursday 
morning and headed to civilization clogging rush hour traffic on 
interstate 75 until wildlife officers chased them off the road 
they were moved to another fencedin field in broward county where 
they remain 
the buffalo saga began march 20 when horse thieves cut a hole 
in the fence surrounding chio ranchero in miami lakes 
while the thieves made off with 26 horses about 250 buffalo 
escaped from the 2000acre pasture said arnold oper a chio 
stockholder 
oper has hired freelance cowboys to track down the buffalo 
valued at 2000 each about 200 of the bison have been rounded up 
so far 
oper and his partners invested in the buffalo with the hope the 
meat would become popular in florida 
wildlife officers charged oper with a seconddegree misdemeanor 
of housing wildlife in an unsafe manner and allowing them to 
escape said jim huffstodt the wildlife commissions information 
officer 
bob harper the golf course superintendent at hollywood lakes 
said buffalo have twice left tracks on the links during the past 
two weeks 
at first nobody believed me when i told them there were 
buffalo out there he said the police thought i was crazy the 
farmer out back thought i was crazy but im from kansas i grew 
up around farms and cattle i know buffalo

senate leaders are expressing growing doubts 
the chamber will ratify the ussoviet nuclear weapons treaty 
before president reagan meets soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in 
moscow eight days from now 
unless the senate speeds up its pace the chance of having 
that little package with the blue ribbon tied around it in the 
presidents pocket by the time he goes to moscow are going to 
diminish daily and hourly senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva said late friday 
the problem is that conservative republicans opposed to the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty have used senate 
rules to delay action according to senate gop leader bob dole of 
kansas 
right now it looks like republicans may be dragging their 
feet dole said im optimistic but less so than i was 
yesterday 
the senate has to approve the treaty itself and then separately 
approve the resolution of ratification it is now considering the 
treaty and opponents have blocked efforts to move on to the 
resolution 
as i see the situation if the senate doesnt complete work on 
the treaty on monday it is going to be increasingly difficult to 
wrap up work on the resolution of ratification by next saturday 
byrd said 
a frustrated dole noted that opponents have refused even to say 
how many amendments they will offer 
there shouldnt be any mystery if you have five amendments or 
10 or 50 or just three my view is that as long as everybody is 
up front we know where we are thats all that i ask when 
nobody will communicate its pretty hard to tell how many 
amendments there are 
the treaty signed dec 8 provides for the elimination within 
three years of all atomictipped missiles with a range of 300 to 
3400 miles 
in votes friday the senate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
rejected 738 an amendment by sen gordon humphrey dnh 
to delay implementing the inf treaty until the president certifies 
that nato has increased its ammunition stocks from the present 
seven days to at least 15 days 
the soviets and their warsaw pact allies have superior numbers 
of nonnuclear weapons 
since i cannot hope to succeed in the adoption of this 
amendment i hope to clarify the effect of this treaty on the 
security of nato and in particular on the 325000 us troops in 
western europe humphrey said prior to the vote 
without nuclear weapons in europe he said our forces 
would be annihilated or at best captured thats why we have 
nuclear weapons there to prevent the annihilation of our troops 
the treaty would remove mediumrange missiles carrying nuclear 
warheads from europe and elsewhere but it would leave thousands of 
battlefield and other nuclear weapons with ranges shorter than 300 
miles in addition to us nuclear warheads on aircraft 
rejected on five votes by overwhelming margins a plan by sen 
steve symms ridaho that would have barred the inf treaty from 
going into effect until reagan certified the soviets were in full 
compliance with five previous arms control agreements although 
reagan has said the soviets violate those agreements the white 
house opposed symms amendments 
all five sections of symms proposal were rejected in 
backtoback roll call votes of 8511 8710 8611 8215 and 898 
dole called the proposal a killer amendment and other 
senators denounced it as an obvious attempt to slow senate 
consideration of the inf treaty

the latest government figures on federal 
spending and tax receipts indicate chances of avoiding 
electionyear budget headaches are growing increasingly dim 
private analysts say 
sharply lower income tax receipts in april and continued 
increases in federal spending left the yeartodate budget deficit 
246 percent higher than in the same month of 1987 the treasury 
department said friday 
private analysts said the april report indicates the government 
will have a tough time avoiding a large jump in the deficit let 
alone achieving the reduction envisioned by the twoyear budget 
deal sealed by lawmakers and the president in december 
the government collected 139 billion more than it spent in 
april helping to hold the deficit for the first seven months of 
the 1988 fiscal year to 105 billion but that was more than 20 
billion higher than the 843 billion gap for the same period a 
year ago 
nevertheless the administration still is officially projecting 
that the tide of red ink will recede from 1502 billion in 1987 to 
1467 billion when the budget year ends sept 30 
now even the 157 billion forecast of the congressional budget 
office appears unreachable analysts said 
i think theyve got problems said john r williams an 
economist with the bankers trust company in new york he warned 
that rising interest rates would increase the cost of financing the 
25 trillion national debt and predicted a deficit of 165 billion 
budget director james c miller iii looking ahead to the 1989 
fiscal year warned tuesday that an acrosstheboard cut in federal 
programs this fall was perilously close under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law if congress continues to spend above the 
limits agreed to in last years budget pact 
in april government revenue totaled 1093 billion 11 percent 
lower than april 1987 spending totaled 954 billion 136 percent 
ahead of the same month a year earlier 
for the first seven months of this fiscal year revenues totaled 
5221 billion up 3 percent over the same period in fiscal 1987 
while spending was 6271 billion up 61 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
it just looks as if we havent been able to corral spending to 
any significant degree yet williams said its not rising as 
rapidly as it had in some previous years but its still charging 
upward 
michael k evans head of an economic forecasting service in 
washington predicted the 1988 deficit will be between 170 billion 
and 175 billion 
aprils the big month after that its all arithmetic 
the belief that it was going to stay below 150 billion was just 
pure fiction he said 
the april surplus bolstered by 533 billion in individual 
income tax payments was about 5 billion less than expected by 
private economists 
some had been hoping the new income tax law would provide a 
small windfall although none expected a balance approaching the 
record 387 billion surplus of april 1987 
individual income tax payments ballooned to 718 billion a year 
ago because taxpayers rushed to sell assets in 1986 before the 
favorable rates on capital gains disappeared under the new tax law 
however no miniwindfall showed up this year 
people who used deductions and shelters paid more than they 
did the year before but the rank and file paid less evans said 
personal income tax collections of 2376 billion for the first 
seven months of this fiscal year are running 27 percent behind 
last year that has been only partially offset by an 84 percent 
increase in corporate income tax collections to 506 billion 
as usual the largest spending categories in april were the 
military followed by social security other programs in the 
department of health and human services and interest on the 
national debt 
military spending totaled 261 billion last month and 1684 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 63 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 163 billion last month 
and 1213 billion for the past seven months up 57 percent from 
the same period in the 1987 fiscal year social security is 
exempted from budget limitations under the grammrudman law and 
most months has been showing faster spending increases than the 
other categories 
the other programs in the department of health and human 
services including medicare and medicaid spent 157 billion in 
april and 932 billion so far this budget year a 65 percent 
increase over 1987 
interest on the national debt totaled 149 billion last month 
and 1201 billion so far this fiscal year an increase of 95 
percent over the same period last year

the financial disclosure forms showed that at least 14 senators 
are millionaires there most likely are more of them but it is not 
possible to tell from the disclosure statements because senators 
are allowed to report income assets and liabilities within broad 
ranges for example a 10 million investment need be reported only 
as exceeding 250000 
on that basis john d rockefeller iv dwva the standard oil 
heir who could be the senates richest member is shown as having a 
net worth that could be as little as 132000 another millionaire 
edward m kennedy dmass put no dollar value on the trusts that 
make up the bulk of his wealth although he reported income of at 
least 596747

a woman opened fire in an elementary 
school killing one child and critically wounding five others 
friday she was found dead when a swat team stormed a nearby house 
where she had wounded a seventh person 
ive just received information that the suspect has been found 
and she is dead police chief herbert timm said nearly nine hours 
after the shooting began at hubbard woods elementary school the 
situation is over 
she shot herself once in the head with a 32caliber pistol 
timm said she indicated in a telephone call to her parents 
that she had shot some people and felt very sorry about that he 
said 
the woman identified as lori dann 30 was carrying three 
handguns around 1045 am when she opened fire inside the 
onestory redbrick school killing a child and wounding five 
others police said 
there was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked 
over as the children panicked during the 15 minutes the shooting 
lasted said glencoe patrolman john ceglieski 
kids were lying around in very serious condition in the 
school timm said kids were hiding under the desk as well as 
well as they could 
she then ran to a nearby house and wounded one of its occupants 
in a struggle hostage negotiators arrived moments later and ms 
dann spoke by telephone to her parents brought to the house in 
hopes of talking her out 
asked why police had not attempted to storm the house earlier 
timm replied weve had seven people shot already were not 
going in there without taking every precaution 
timm said he decided to send the swat team into the house after 
repeated efforts by police and ms danns parents failed to contact 
her the team was accompanied by fbi agents with sound detectors 
probing for movement in the house 
timm said police had yet to establish a motive for the rampage 
ms dann allegedly set a fire earlier friday eight blocks away at 
the home of a couple where she worked as a housekeeper in this 
affluent north shore community 
she reportedly was upset having been told she was losing her 
job because the family was moving police said 
timm reconstructing a day of violence at an evening news 
conference said ms dann set two fires and carried a gasoline can 
to the door of a daycare center before embarking on the shooting 
spree 
before going to the school friday police said ms dann went to 
the home of padraig and marion rushe on forest glen to take two of 
their children 4 and 6 years old to the zoo 
instead of going to the zoo however timm said ms dann took 
the children to ravinia school in neighboring highland park where 
she set off one of several incendiary devices she carried in her 
car friday 
authorities found one of the devices burning there but 
extinguished it before it could cause any damage 
timm said ms dann drove next to a daycare center where she 
went to the front door carrying a can of gasoline but she was 
met at the front door by a staff member who asked what she was 
doing and she took off said timm 
he said ms dann returned to the rushe home talked with mrs 
rushe and the children in a family room in the basement then went 
upstairs and set off another incendiary device 
while the fire raged upstairs mrs rushe managed to push her 
two children through a small window in the basement then crawl out 
herself ms dann meanwhile made her way about eight blocks to 
the school police said 
timm said several other incendiary devices were found in ms 
danns car in the neighborhood near the house where the standoff 
took place 
the fbi said it had an investigative interest in ms dann 
and madison wis police lt william sprague said she had been 
arrested there march 14 on a charge of retail theft he gave no 
further details 
keith wilson told the wisconsin state journal from his home in 
los angeles that he had roomed across the hall from ms dann when 
they attended the university of wisconsin he described her as 
just an absolutely bizarre lady and said sometimes shed 
wander the halls and try to open doors 
timm the police chief said when the woman walked into the 
school around 1045 am her first stop was a boys bathroom 
where she shot a youngster 
she left him and ran into one classroom telling the teacher 
there that a boy had been wounded said timm then she entered 
a second classroom announced she had a gun and opened fire 
police recovered a 357caliber magnum revolver from the school 
for which timm said ms dann had been issued a permit how did a 
woman with that kind of background get licensed to carry a gun 
timm said 
joe sumner director of winnetka police operations said the 
woman then ran through the woods from the school and entered the 
home where four members of a family and their maid were present 
apparently she just walked in and confronted the 
homeowners sumner said the mother came running out and said 
theres a woman in my home with a gun 
then we heard a shot the son came out holding a gun and 
fell over in the driveway sumner said 
the son 20yearold philip andrew apparently struggled with 
the suspect grabbed one of her weapons and was shot in the chest 
sumner said the father maid and grandfather fled by a side door 
leaving her alone inside 
wilmette police sgt michael geier said the woman was believed 
to have set fire to the home where she worked while a mother and 
her children were in the basement doing laundry 
this woman set a fire in the house trapping the people in the 
basement he said they escaped got out apparently without 
serious injury 
eightyearold nick corwin died of his wounds at highland park 
hospital said spokesman mark newtwon 
another 8yearold boy and andrew were in critical condition at 
the hospital said spokeswoman sue masaracchia 
the four children at evanston hospital were reported in critical

the contra guerrillas are leaving nicaragua 
at a high rate because they are hungry and searching for food 
in neighboring honduras the head of the us foreign aid program 
says 
the americansupported contras are moving because they have been 
blocked from receiving supplies at their jungle bases in nicaragua 
said alan woods administrator of the agency for international 
development 
woods told a senate subcommittee friday that there are people 
inside nicaragua who are desperate weve had reports of people 
eating tree roots 
woods declined to estimate how many people were involved but 
other administration officials have said that up to 3000 rebels 
have fled into neighboring honduras in recent weeks to look for 
food 
the administration plans to give cash to the contras to buy 
food at the rate of 1 per day per rebel woods said the money 
which will be sent in by couriers will be in the form of cordobas 
the nicaraguan currency 
we have taken this particular step as a last resort he 
said adding that the united states wants to keep as many contras 
inside nicaragua as possible 
the contras and nicaraguas leftist sandinista government are in 
the middle of peace talks and keeping the contras inside the 
central american nation will keep the pressure on nicaragua us 
officials say 
a march 23 agreement between the contras and the sandinistas 
allows humanitarian aid to go to the guerrillas during the peace 
talks but woods said there has been a dispute over how to 
distribute the aid and the impasse has blocked any help from being 
sent 
direct shipments of food have not begun because the two sides 
cannot agree on a neutral distribution organization a requirement 
spelled out by congress in march when it voted 48 million in 
humanitarian aid 
woods said the international red cross has been rejected by the 
contras as a delivery agency but he didnt know why 
the simple bottom line is that if theyd reach agreement 
wed start delivering food he said 
the cash plan is a substitute he told the foreign relations 
western hemisphere subcommittee 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the subcommittee 
raised a number of questions about the cash plan 
dodd called it a pretty weak accounting system and suggested 
the proposal raises serious questions about compliance with 
existing legislative restrictions 
woods responded that were doing the best we can under the 
circumstances to account for the money 
when congress approved the humanitarian aid it barred using any 
of the money for weapons it would be difficult to use the cordobas 
to buy guns because the currency is not generally accepted outside 
nicaragua woods said 
two republicans on the subcommittee sens rudy boschwitz of 
minnesota and paul trible of virginia praised woods efforts 
boschwitz said it really is a difficult situation 
trible added its very easy to criticize but youre 
operating under very difficult circumstances

vice president george bush was told as early 
as 1983 of allegations that panamanian officials were involved in 
the drug trade but did not follow up on them says bushs top 
foreign policy aide 
the aide donald gregg testified in a deposition friday that 
thenpanamanian president ricardo de la espriella mentioned the 
allegations to the vice president at the close of a december 1983 
meeting in panama but the panamanian official also told bush the 
stories were untrue 
bush then chairman of a task force to combat the flow of drugs 
into south florida said he had not been aware of the charges 
or he would have raised them with de la espriella gregg 
testified in a deposition for a private civil lawsuit 
after returning to washington we did nothing to follow that 
up gregg said it was not yet as clear to us as it has 
subsequently become who was involved 
the meeting also was attended by manuel antonio noriega the 
general who now is panamas de facto leader and who was indicted in 
florida in february on drug charges bush has said he received no 
reliable information connecting noriega to drugs until the 
indictment 
gregg also testified that he was aware in 1983 that the 
government of panama had been helpful to the united states in 
getting military supplies to nicaraguas contra rebels 
the testimony came during a daylong deposition taken for a 24 
million suit by the christic institute a liberal policy group 
charging that a list of defendants some of whom were involved in 
the irancontra affair supplied the contras with weapons in trade 
for cocaine and conspired in a failed attempt to assassinate a 
maverick contra field commander eden pastora 
richard stearns greggs justice department attorney objected 
repeatedly to the questioning charging that it ranged far from the 
subject of the suit and was being done for political purposes 
i think its quite clear you have some other agenda in mind 
he told michael withey an attorney for the plaintiffs 
on thursday another bush aide col samuel j watson had 
invoked executive privilege and declined to answer when asked 
during a similar deposition what bush and the us ambassador to 
panama everett briggs discussed about narcotics at a meeting on 
dec 16 1985 
when withey questioned gregg on friday about the same meeting 
gregg agreed to discuss it but said his recollection was not 
specific 
i think we came away from the meeting with ambassador briggs 
with the sense that noriega was a growing problem politically 
militarily and possibly in the drug area gregg testified but he 
said any drug problems involving noriega were not highlighted 
by briggs 
later in the day withey asked gregg the fact that general 
noriega may have had some involvement in the narcotics problem 
that was coming out of the december 85 meeting at that time isnt 
that correct 
gregg responded it would have been part of the general 
picture of noriega as a political problem as corruption and as a 
general policy problem yes 
but talking with reporters later gregg said he did not recall 
any discussion of noriegas involvement in drug trafficking i am 
saying that narcotics as a problem in panama was part of the agenda 
of the meeting there was no discussion of any direct 
connection between that and noriega 
gregg also testified that a state department briefing paper 
would have been prepared for bushs meeting with briggs outlining 
the background of the ambassadors concerns and that the paper 
would have been placed in bushs briefing book 
that document is among papers sought by the plaintiffs in the 
suit but which have not been turned over by the government

a new government board created to help the 
financially troubled farm credit system has taken its biggest step 
so far by approving 90 million for the federal land bank of 
louisville ky 
eric p thor chief executive officer of the farm credit system 
assistance board said friday the louisville bank will receive 
assistance through the sale of up to 90 million in preferred stock 
to the financial assistance corp which will raise funds for that 
investment by selling 15year bonds 
the board and corporation were created by last years 
agricultural credit act to help bail out the financially distressed 
farm credit system a network of cooperatively owned farm banks and 
associations 
thor said the louisville bank which serves borrowers in ohio 
indiana kentucky and tennessee applied to th board for financial 
help in february he said the board and the bank have reached 
agreement on a number of steps which will continue to strengthen 
the institutions financial management 
although the louisville bank had presented a wellthoughtout 
workable plan for financial recovery its stock had dropped to 65 
percent of par value and the bank was unable to implement the plan 
without federal help he said 
the bank has made substantial progress in resolving its own 
financial problems over the past two years thor said 
programs included an assetliability management program in 1986 
to control interest rate risks and reduce costs and a marketbased 
loan pricing system in 1987 to provide competitive rates to 
borrowers also he said the bank reduced its nonperforming 
loans and inventory of acquired property by 30 percent and 
projects a similar reduction this year 
jeanne kling a spokeswoman for the board said the 90 million 
for the louisville bank was the first fullblown assistance 
designated under the new law 
earlier this year the board approved 25 million in limited 
purpose assistance in shortterm funding to help the federal land 
bank of jackson miss stay in business and 205 million was 
provided to retire stock in six financially troubled production 
credit associations in the omaha neb and spokane wash 
districts 
but this is the first one that weve done under the general 
context of helping the bank in general ms kling said 
the 1987 law gave the board broad authority to work with 
institutions of the farm credit system the board consists of the 
secretaries of agriculture and treasury with a third member still 
to be confirmed by the senate

one reason for an upturn in us wheat exports 
has been bad weather in europe and the soviet union says an 
agriculture department report 
the adverse weather kept competitor production down and import 
demand up the departments economic research service said 
friday as a result us wheat exports are expected be at their 
highest level since 1981 
rail car shortages have plagued grain shippers since june 
1987 but the total distribution system may yet meet domestic and 
export commitments the report said 
the brief report included much information released may 10 when 
usdas new 1988 winter wheat forecast was issued including 
supplyanddemand figures showing that the total wheat carryover on 
june 1 for 198889 may be around 123 billion bushels 
while still equivalent to more than 5 months of anticipated 
use almost 60 percent of the june 1 carryover is expected to be 
in commodity credit corp inventory or the farmerowned reserve 
the report said 
wheat held by the ccc or under price support loan in the 
farmerowned reserve is effectively locked out of the free market 
and doesnt have an impact on price movements 
the 198889 season average market price of wheat is forecast at 
289 to 320 per bushel up from 255 in 198788 and 242 in 
198687 the report said

seoul south korea ap the un command charged today that 
north korea of scheming to disrupt the olympic games in seoul with 
false claims that war could break out on the divided korean 
peninsula 
us rear adm william pendley told a news conference that 
communist north korea is trying to stir up tension to scare other 
nations away from the olympics 
although the north wants the world to believe the dmz 
demilitarized zone is aflame and war is imminent that is just 
not the case at all said pendley a senior official of the 
united nations command 
pendley said north korea has made a barrage of false claims in 
recent months accusing us and south korean forces of preparing 
for war and opening fire with artillery and machine guns on the 
border 
all the north korean charges have been investigated and none 
were substantiated pendley said he said they were clearly 
propaganda and lies to undermine the olympic games scheduled for 
sept 17 to oct 2 
north korea would like to scare off olympic teams and fans 
he said 
the olympics have become a major symbol in the bitter struggle 
between the two koreas the south sees the games as proof of how it 
has outstripped the north in almost every field 
pendley said the un command is making every effort to preserve 
stability on the border and avoid confrontation with the north 
peace is vital to ensure the safety of the olympics he said 
north korea has said it will boycott the games because south 
korea and the international olympic commmittee rejected its demand 
to cohost the event south korea has offered to let the north 
stage up to five olympic events 
on friday opposition leader kim daejung proposed that south 
korea and north korea hold talks on cohosting the games 
he said such an arrangement would benefit the south by ensuring 
the security of the olympics and forcing north to open its closed 
society promoting chances of national unification 
but today kim retracted the call saying i have no intention 
of carrying my point alone if other parties oppose it 
the idea had invited immediate opposition from the government 
which denounced it as a irresponsible political maneuvering 
that would help the north disrupt the olympics 
pendley said he was confident the olympics would be a success 
and the participation of 161 nations including north koreas 
communist allies should discourage any provocation by the north 
the adminiral represents the un command delegation at meetings 
with north korean and chinese delegates under the military 
armistice commission 
the commission polices the ceasefire that ended the korean war 
which ended in 1953 three years after beginning when the north 
invaded the south 
about 42000 us troops are based in the south as part of a 
mutual defense pact against the north the un command consists of 
the united states south korea and other nations that fought 
against the north 
in reply to a question pendley said there were no unusual north 
korean military movements to indicate they expected trouble or were 
preparing for war 
but south korean and us forces based in the south would take 
every security precaution to guard the games pendley said 
you can never be assured as to what the north will do he 
said 
south korea the united states japan and dozens of other 
nations contend north korea was responsible for the nov 29 bombing 
of a south korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board 
a woman who said she was a north korean agent said she had 
bombed the plane as part of efforts to disrupt the olympics

the soviet union is poised to turn its naval 
repair facility in syria into a permanent base in a move cementing 
the military alliance between the two nations janes defense 
weekly says 
the expanded base at tartus would serve as home for the soviets 
mediterranean navy according to todays issue of the respected 
magazine 
janes based its report on diplomatic sources which it did not 
identify 
the report said the development of tartus indicates a 
consolidation of the soviet unions military relationship with its 
key middle east ally 
janes said a number of highranking soviet military officials 
had visited tartus recently port calls had increased and 
deployment of aircraft had been expanded 
it said western analysts were particularly concerned because the 
soviet admiral in charge of tartus supervised the development of 
the soviets cam ranh bay base in vietnam 
cam ranh bay has been described by us intelligence sources as 
the largest soviet naval forward deployment base outside the 
soviet union the report said 
it said the soviets have used tartus about 35 miles north of 
the lebanese border since 1969 as a limited repair and maintenance 
facility but their presence increased markedly in 1976 after they 
were expelled from egyptian bases 
the magazine said tartus is now the soviets primary maintenance 
facility for submarines and the deployment of antisurface warfare 
and reconnaissance aircraft has increased 
janes said the soviets pay no rent for the base

vice president george bush took another step away from president 
reagans controversial negotiations with panamas indicted leader 
manuel noriega on friday democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
said the american people want an explanation of why the reagan 
administration was dealing with noriega 
dukakis campaigning in california said somebody in the 
administration should tell the american people who it was who 
thought it was in the interests of the american people and this 
country that we do business with somebody who was a known drug 
peddler and who was suspected of murder 
he added unless and until we have that explanation im not 
going to be satisfied 
bush said nothing publicly on noriega but his maneuverings came 
two days after he declared that he would not negotiate with accused 
drug runners in this country or on foreign soil at the time he 
did not mention either panama or its indicted leader noriega by 
name 
but following the publication of a story friday in the 
washington post the vice presidents chief of staff craig fuller 
issued a statement saying that the administration sources who 
have suggested that the vice president favors ending the 
negotiations and bringing the envoy back to washington are 
essentially correct 
the statement was issued just hours before sources disclosed a 
tentative agreement for noriega to relinquish power and leave 
panama temporarily in exchange for the reagan administration 
dropping the drug indictment 
the fuller statement was as close as bush has come to publicly 
uttering words of disagreement with reagan over his panamanian 
policy and came after several days of slippage in the public 
opinion polls and with many republican allies urging him to air his 
differences with the president 
the issue of panama and drugs also arose in a court deposition 
given by donald gregg bushs national security adviser 
gregg said in the sworn statement that the president of panama 
told the vice president in december 1983 that allegations of drug 
running among government officials were untrue 
the vice president said he had not been aware of the charges 
or he would have raised them during the session gregg testified 
in a deposition for a private civil lawsuit 
he added we did nothing to follow up the vice president 
was chairman of the south florida drug interdiction task force at 
the time 
spokesman stephen hart had no comment on greggs deposition 
jesse jackson meanwhile repeated his criticism of us 
negotiations with noriega but made no reference to the reported 
tentative agreement 
noriega is not plea bargaining with reagan and bush reagan 
and bush are plea bargaining with noriega jackson told more than 
500 supporters at a san francisco church 
jackson the sole remaining rival to dukakis for the democratic 
nomination said we need to know whats going on send a special 
prosecutor to panama send a congressional delegation to panama 
hear both sides of an ugly story 
dukakis also campaigned in california in advance of the states 
june 7 primary 
he said he and jackson met on sunday and will be meeting 
regularly the massachusetts governor did not say what he and 
jackson would discuss in their talks but his challenger has been 
pressing for a greater share of votes from super delegates to 
the democratic national convention these party and elected 
officials who are automatically entitled to attend the nominating 
convention have largely been lining up behind dukakis 
at home the dukakis administration announced new proposed 
spending cuts efficiency steps and revenue plans designed to 
improve the bottom line of dukakis 119 billion state budget 
proposal for next year by 217 million 
faced with a shortfall in tax collections dukakis is proposing 
to cut 92 million from expansions he had previously proposed in 
dozens of individual programs he also signed off on a hopedfor 
47 million in savings through improved government operations he 
also hopes to raise millions more through bottle deposits and a 
higher tax on cigarettes fridays sobering budget news could hurt 
dukakis attempts to campaign on earlier balanced budgets 
democratic platform writers met in suburban washington where 
sen john glenn of ohio said the public is under the great 
misconception that nuclear arms treaties may allow the united 
states to spend less on conventional weapons 
glenn mentioned as a possible running mate on a dukakis ticket 
said the truth was exactly the opposite we may have to spend 
more instead of less 
rep ron dellums of california representing both the jackson 
campaign and his own views said the democrats should find ways to 
reduce the burden of the pentagons 299 billion budget which has 
doubled since 1980 
dellums said the united states should call home some of its 
325000 troops in europe and scrap a wide range of weapon systems 
from the mx missile the midgetman and trident ii to research on 
star wars 
democratic national chairman paul kirk meanwhile unleashed a 
stinging attack on bush as a quintessential elitist establishment 
republican country clubber 
in a speech before the association of democratic state chairs 
meeting in atlanta kirk said the vice president has been 
applauding in the dark shadows of this republican administration 
as it turns thumbs down on the civil rights restoration act thumbs 
down on a simple 60day notice to working men and women who are 
about to lose their jobs 
he said bush has neither the toughness to govern nor the 
compassion to care

congressional negotiators moved a giant step 
closer to final agreement on catastrophic health insurance 
legislation by reaching a tentative compromise on a new medicare 
prescription drug benefit 
rep fortney h stark dcalif said friday he was hopeful that 
resolution of the complicated drug issue by a housesenate working 
group of eight legislators could pave the way for final votes on 
the overall legislation next week 
although several other differences have yet to be worked out in 
the first major expansion of medicare in its 23year history stark 
said they are not likely to be as sticky as the drug benefit 
both the senate and house versions of the underlying legislation 
contained a prescription drug benefit 
however the house version was more expansive and from the 
senate perspective had far fewer controls to keep the potentially 
unpredictable costs of a new program from outstripping revenues 
collected to pay for it 
medicare does not now cover any outpatient drugs except for a 
handful of particularly costly medications such as antirejection 
drugs for transplant recipients 
the compromise being recommended to the full housesenate 
conference committee by the working group calls for the new drug 
benefit to be phased in starting jan 1 1991 
after a 600 deductible is met medicare would pay half the cost 
of any other prescription drugs in 1991 the medicare share still 
after a 600 deductible would rise to 60 percent in 1992 and to 
80 percent in 1993 and thereafter 
in a costcontrol measure pushed by the senate the premiums 
charged beneficiaries to cover the new drug benefit would be 
indexed each year to cover the cost of the program and to keep a 
special drug payment trust fund solvent 
in the first two years of the program until the indexing 
mechanism could be put in full force the secretary of the 
department of health and human would have broad powers to keep 
costs within projected income 
thereafter the indexing feature would cover additional costs 
the initial level of those premiums and details of the indexing 
are to be worked out in subsequent negotiations of the full 
conference committee 
although the full conference also has several other differences 
to resolve there is broad support for the underlying legislation 
which passed both houses of congress overwhelmingly 
administration sources have indicated president reagan whose 
original proposal did not contain a prescription drug benefit is 
likely to sign the measure if it has adequate safeguards to protect 
against runaway drug costs 
the basic legislation does not make provisions for basic 
longterm nursing home care under medicare but would shield 
medicare beneficiaries against financially crippling outofpocket 
doctor and hospital bills 
while the cap is one of the issues still to be resolved it is 
expected to be between 1043 the latest house offer and 1370 
the latest senate offer medicare would pick up all hospital and 
physician costs for a beneficiary after the cap was met in a given 
year 
medicare now pays full costs for 60 days of a hospital stay in a 
given year minus a firstday deductible and pays 80 percent of 
doctor bills no matter how high they range 
on the cost side the major disagreement is how to distribute 
the additional costs medicare enrollees will have to pay both a 
flat monthly fee that will be imposed on all and a socalled 
supplemental premium that is tantamount to an income tax surcharge 
for the estimated 60 percent of medicare recipients with enough 
income to make them subject to federal income taxes

a california congressman says democratic 
platform writers should be mindful that a significant wing of 
the party shares the jackson campaigns view that pentagon budgets 
should be pared by 200 billion over the next four years 
either were a party advocating peace or were a party 
advocating war rep ron dellums representing both jesse 
jacksons campaign and his own views told the partys platform 
committee friday 
he proposed sharp cuts in military weaponry and calling home 
some of the 325000 us troops in europe fears of a land war 
breaking out with the soviets are a gross absurdity and great 
waste of resources he said 
but two democratic senators who are mentioned as possible 
running mates for frontrunner michael dukakis said the party must 
stand for a strong national defense 
sen sam nunn of georgia said there is some reason for hope 
for an era of improved relations with the soviet union 
but in terms of designing a us defense strategy we must 
acknowledge that under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev soviet 
military power has not gone down it has increased said nunn 
chairman of the senate armed services committee 
we must measure our defense commitment not against soviet 
intentions which can change overnight but against soviet military 
capabilities nunn said 
sen john glenn of ohio said the public was laboring under the 
misconception that breakthroughs in nuclear arms talks will free 
the united states to cut the pentagon budget 
glenn said the truth was exactly the opposite we may have 
to spend more instead of less at least in the short term on 
conventional weapons 
but dellums drew loud applause from the audience of 100 at the 
forum on defense policy with his call for reducing planned

democrats jesse jackson and frontrunner 
michael dukakis are going headtohead on spending in the home 
stretch of the presidential primary season as vice president george 
bush coasts along with a comfortable bank account 
jackson who once had to scrimp along while dukakis surpassed 
all the other democrats in fundraising actually matched the 
massachusetts governor in money from contributors during the month 
of april both men collected 19 million reports filed friday 
showed 
with federal matching funds and a 624000 loan added to his 
receipts jackson raised more than dukakis overall in april the 
reports showed he had a total of 42 million in receipts 
including 17 in matching funds while dukakis took in 34 
million including 11 million in matching funds 
dukakis has borrowed no money and has been the democratic money 
leader since he entered the presidential race the figures show 
continued growth in jacksons fundraising capability which 
started out very weak but has steadily improved 
looking toward the costly battles in california and new jersey 
dukakis and jackson each entered may with 1 millionplus bank 
accounts 
while dukakis is collecting delegates at a pace that will land 
him the democratic nomination jackson still is waging a 
highstakes fight 
jackson actually spent more than dukakis during april but a 
good chunk of it 804570 went to pay off loans according to 
the financial disclosure report he filed with the federal election 
commission jackson spokesman tom schade said the borrowing and 
repayment figures reflected a rotating line of credit for jacksons 
operating expenses 
jackson reported spending 4 million during the month that saw 
costly races in new york and pennsylvania while dukakis spent 37 
million 
jackson ended the month with 11 million in cash on hand and 
548741 in debts dukakis had 14 million on hand and 699906 
in obligations 
on the republican side bush had 4 million in the bank at the 
end of april after raising 2 million for the month including 
12 million in matching funds and spending 17 million bush 
also reported taking out a 20000 loan for general election 
campaign startup costs 
bushs only remaining rival religious broadcaster pat 
robertson suspended his campaign last week robertson reported a 
debt of 14 million at the start of this month he raised 11 
million with 341523 of that in federal matching funds and spent 
11 million during april robertson had 29473 in the bank 
dukakis campaign said he has raised 236 million from the 
start of his campaign through the end of april including 68 
million in matching funds which are based on the amount a 
candidate raises on his own 
jacksons campaign total through april was 117 million 
dukakis campaign has been wearing a tight belt lately in order 
to save enough for the expensive june 7 california primary and 
still be able to spend on its summer convention operations without 
surpassing the 27 million cap on the amount primary candidates are 
allowed to spend 
among the alsorans democrats sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
and rep richard gephardt of missouri each have campaign debts of 
16 million their reports show republican sen bob dole of 
kansas was left with a 12 million debt after he dropped out of 
the race

government regulators are holding out hope of 
an early reopening date for the jackson miss federal land bank 
whose doors have been closed as a result of longrunning financial 
problems 
the bank will reopen under the management of a receiver as 
soon as it is practicable farm credit administration chairman 
frank w naylor jr said friday in a statement 
he announced that the billiondollar farm credit system bank was 
being closed and that ronald e watkins of jackson was being 
appointed as a receiver to manage its strained finances 
officials formally closed the doors of the bank and its 90 
branches in mississippi alabama and louisiana at 530 pm edt on 
friday 
the institution is the most troubled component of the 50 
billion farm credit system a nationwide network of borrowerowned 
banks and lending associations that represents a major credit 
source for american agriculture 
financial woes that have plagued the farm credit system through 
the 1980s prompted congress to pass a major bailout law last year 
the jackson bank earlier received 30 million under the plan to 
raise loan money but had been losing 47 million a month since the 
first of the year 
the loan portfolio totaled 168 billion a years end but 40 
percent of that amount was classified as either nonperforming or 
high risk meanwhile liabilities climbed to 19 billion on march 
31 
in closing the banks doors and naming a receiver authorities 
moved to reassure both borrowers and creditors 
we have taken this prudent action in order to enable the farm 
credit system to continue to provide a full range of credit 
services to the borrowers in the threestate area naylor said 
his agency regulates institutions within the system 
borrower stock is protected by the recently passed 
agricultural credit act of 1987 and will be retired by the receiver 
with funds provided under the act naylor said he said earlier 
legislation provides mechanisms to assure that there will be no 
disruption of payment of principle and interest on the banks 
outstanding securities 
rew enterprises inc headed by watkins issued a letter saying 
that every available effort will be made to continue serving 
all the borrowers 
rep e kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee issued a statement calling it unfortunate 
that the situation in regard to the jackson federal land bank has 
come to this stage 
but i have been assured by fca personnel that the liquidation 
procedure will be similar to the procedure that the federal deposit 
insurance corporation uses when closing a commercial bank de la 
garza said in fact fdic personnel are assisting with the 
liquidation arrangements today 
borrower stock and rights will be protected and operations 
will begin almost immediately under a new bank structure he 
said he added that he had been assured that other banks will 
assist in providing necessary credit so that there will be no 
interruption in providing for the needs of farmers

the second of two reactors at the braidwood 
nuclear plant near chicago should be in full operation by summer 
under a fullpower license granted by the nuclear regulatory

very confident well maintain that kind of the support from the 
nrc

brought up to full power gradually producing 11 million kilowatts 
of electricity a day when fully operational in the summer

southwest of joliet ill was licensed for fullpower operation on 
july 2 1987 
ingram said the time between issuance of lowpower and 
fullpower licenses for the second braidwood unit was somewhat 
longer than usual because of equipment problems that have since 
been resolved

an aging pioneer spacecraft that 
gave scientists their first closeup look at venus continues to 
yield secrets of the cloudshrouded planet 10 years after its 
launch nasa says 
the pioneer orbiter has revealed many previously unknown 
features of venus whose thick veil of sulfuric acid clouds has 
kept earths telescopes from seeing its 800degree surface 
it challenges our thinking to try to understand why did venus 
evolve in such a different fashion than earth project scientist 
larry colin said friday and are there any lessons to be learned 
there in terms of the direction our own climate is evolving 
the probe with some adjustments should continue to send data 
until it burns up in the venusian atmosphere when its fuel runs out 
in the summer of 1992 said colin and project manager richard 
fimmel 
the two nasa officials quietly celebrated the 10th anniversary 
of the probes launch with a news briefing at nasa ames research 
center here 35 miles south of san francisco 
the pioneer orbiter one of a series of space probes developed 
at ames was launched at kennedy space center in florida on may 20 
1978 pioneer originally carried five probes which separated from 
the orbiter and descended into venus atmosphere on dec 9 1978 
studying the atmosphere before they burned up 
radar data from the 200 million probe provided scientists with 
detailed maps of 90 percent of the planets surface the 
information also helped them understand weather patterns in venus 
dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and how the solar wind affects it 
while venus has been called earths twin because it is similar 
in size and density the planet is inhospitably hot because of what 
scientists call a runaway greenhouse effect or overheating 
caused when the atmosphere trapped solar radiation 
pioneer revealed hints of old volcanoes on venus since 
confirmed by radar studies from earth and by the soviet unions 
venera 15 and 16 spacecraft 
but the orbiter is beginning to show its age 
like people spacecraft get old and pioneer venus has its 
aches and pains fimmel said 
the probes solar cells which power the craft and its 
scientific instruments are degrading partly due to a natural 
process partly to bombardment by highenergy sun particles colin 
said 
when the orbiter had full power scientists could run all the 
instruments at once but now they must operate them at different 
times he said 
the probe a cylinder 8 feet in diameter and 4 feet high and 
topped with a yardwide antenna dish is now about 1200 miles 
above the planets surface 
scientists are looking forward to the culmination of the mission 
in 1992 when the probes orbit will bring it within 93 miles of 
venus into the upper reaches of the planets atmosphere 
pioneer has been unable to take measurements in the planets 
atmosphere since its arrival because of a varying elliptical orbit 
during its fatal reentry the probe will be able to detect major 
changes since then colin said 
the orbiter also has studied several comets including halleys 
encke giacobinizinner wilson mcnaught and 
nishikawatakimizawatago 
the venus orbiter is one of six pioneer probes still operating 
sun orbiter pioneer vi launched in december 1965 is the oldest

gen manuel antonio noriega says he 
wants recognition of his president and a reduction of us forces 
in panama before he agrees to end his standoff with washington 
though a white house official said friday that a tentative deal 
had been worked out under which the general would step down as 
panamas military leader noriega stridently repeated conditions he 
has insisted on for weeks 
he spoke friday during a dedication of a grandstand and 
sportcasters and dignitaries box at an athletic complex in this 
workingclass suburb nine miles northeast of panama city 
there cannot be conversation if the us aggression 
continues aggression at whatever level whatever magnitude 
whether it is psychological or economic aggression noriega said 
second there must be respect for the government of the 
president of the republic manuel solis palma and there cannot be 
conversation there cannot be a solution if an exaggerated number 
of troops remain on our territory as psychological aggression he 
said 
neither can there be a solution he said unless the government 
that remains is recognized by panamas military 
about 10000 us troops are normally stationed at 10 us 
military installations along the panama canal about 2000 
reinforcements have been added in recent months as tensions rose 
between the united states and panama 
noriega did not refer to a report in washington that us and 
panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls 
for the general to leave panama for nine months beginning in august 
in return the united states would drop federal drug smuggling 
charges against noriega according to a reagan administration 
official in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
noriega as head of the 15000member defense forces controls 
the civilian government the reagan administration has imposed 
sweeping economic sanctions against the country in an effort to 
force his ouster 
the united states still recognizes eric arturo delvalle who has 
been in hiding as panamas legitimate president noriega 
engineered delvalles dismissal on feb 26 the day after delvalle 
tried to fire noriega 
noriega spoke to supporters in san miguelito from the new 
dignitaries box on the field were several hundred members of the 
socalled dignity batallions volunteers formed to confront what 
the noriega regime says is the danger of a us invasion 
about three dozen volunteers armed with world war iiera rifles 
ran through an obstacle course then battered a dummy dressed in 
olive green during a demonstration of their training skills 
noriega said the militias would fight any invaders 
those powerful ones who think they can come to this territory 
without getting a whipping are mistaken he said 
the master of ceremonies who introduced noriega told foreign 
reporters if there is an invasion you wont be filming 
panamanian cadavers but the cadavers of north american soldiers 
that we will send home to north american mothers 
noriega concluded the list of conditions for a uspanamanian 
solution by saying if i have said nothing it is because i know 
them the americans and because i know them i remain silent 
he also denounced corruption in public administration 
what we need he said is punishment similar to islamic 
punishment he who puts his hand in the till should have it cut 
off we must reach that kind of radicalization 
about 400 militia members were at the combination soccer and 
baseball field scores of panamanian flags fluttered in the slight 
breeze 
a similar number of residents were in the grandstands and around 
the playing field 
several folk groups danced and sang traditional songs one dance 
company featured women in long flowing skirts performing folk tunes 
played on guitars and tamborines

archbishop desmond tutu told 
students that apartheid is so utterly evil immoral unbiblical 
and unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil 
system nazism 
at his installation friday as chancellor of the university of 
the western cape the nations most militant university the black 
anglican clergman also defended his appeals for tough western 
sanctions against south africa 
the onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable 
nonviolent alternative said the prelate who is the anglican 
spiritual leader for all of southern africa and winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize 
tutu said he accepted the position of chancellor on behalf of 
detainees political exiles displaced blacks and other victims of 
this vile and obscene system of apartheid the countrys race 
segregation system under which the black majority has no voice in 
national affairs 
the prelate returned home thursday from a month in europe and 
the united states during which he asked for punitive sanctions 
against this country 
the calls were widely covered here in the news media and 
denounced not only by the government but by white and black 
moderates who say sanctions will increase black unemployment 
without inducing whites to accept reforms 
the problem is not sanctions the problem is apartheid tutu 
said friday i want apartheid destroyed not reformed if it can 
be done away with without sanctions i will sing hallelujah 
tutu was greeted by hundreds of cheering students upon his 
arrival 
as chancellor at the university of the western cape tutu will 
be the honorary leader of a university that the government 
established for mixedrace students in 1960 as part of its 
segregated educational system

china has approved new regulations to give 
foreignfunded businesses greater freedom in hiring and firing 
workers the official china daily newspaper reported today 
the move comes as china energetically seeks to boost foreign 
investment to advance its economic development 
the new rules buck the countrys statecontrolled industrial and 
business enterprises known as work units which have often 
blocked people from changing jobs and resisted dismissals for 
anything short of serious crimes or work violations 
the newspaper said the new rules approved by the state council 
let foreignfunded businesses recruit their own workers and 
managerial staff they will no longer need permission from local 
labor offices to hire workers from outside the area where the 
businesses are located the newspaper said 
workers recruited by such businesses will be able to resign from 
their present jobs even if their work units raise objections it 
said 
the regulations also say foreignfunded ventures can fire 
employees according to their contracts and without being subject to 
outside intervention

the us and panamanian governments are 
weighing a proposed agreement that calls for the temporary 
departure of gen manuel antonio noriega from panama in august in 
return for the dismissal of drug smuggling indictments against him 
an administration source says 
michael g kozak a state department official who has spent much 
of the past several weeks in panama left for washington on friday 
to explain to his superiors the details of his negotiating effort 
with panamanian authorities 
the draft agreement would allow noriega to visit panama for 
holidays and to return permanently following a ninemonth stay 
outside panama that ends after presidential elections are held in 
may 1989 said the official who asked not to be identified 
the official expressed strong objections to the agreement partly 
because it would allow noriega to play a role in the formation of a 
transition government that would assume power before his 
resignation in august as commander of panamas defense forces 
the state department confirmed kozaks departure from panama but 
declined further comment 
the administration source emphasized that no final agreement has 
been struck and this was confirmed by a white house spokesman and 
by an attorney for noriega in florida 
noriega speaking friday at the dedication of a sports facility 
near panama city said that before an agreement is possible the 
united states must agree to recognize manuel solis palma as 
panamas president and must reduce the number of us troops in 
panama 
there cannot be conversation if the us aggression 
continues aggression at whatever level whatever magnitude 
whether it is psychological or economic aggression noriega added 
the proposed agreement is expected to touch off heated debate in 
the administration mostly because of the stipulation that drug 
smuggling indictments against noriega be dropped 
according to the official vice president george bush already 
has registered his objections 
the official said he shared bushs reservations contending that 
if it the agreement gets accepted it gives noriega everything 
he wants 
the official said there were no assurances that noriega was 
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the 
defense chief might have no intention of resigning his post as the 
agreement specifies 
associates of noriega have said in recent weeks that he sees 
aug 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the fifth 
anniversary of his accession as commander of the defense forces 
the state department view is that dropping the indictments 
against noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he 
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in panama 
it contends that if noriegas price for leaving panama is 
dismissal of the indictments this would be a lowcost way of 
resolving the 12weekold crisis which has dropped uspanamanian 
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in panama 
according to a published report earlier this week the united 
states would reserve the right to reinstate the charges once 
noriega returns to panama 
the reagan administration has been calling on noriega to step 
down since the indictments were returned on feb 5 
president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire noriega on feb 25 
but was ousted himself the following day by the pronoriega 
national assembly the united states continues to recognize 
delvalle as the legitimate authority in panama 
bush made known his reservations about the administrations 
negotiating position on wednesday asserting that as president he 
would not bargain with drug dealers whether on us or foreign soil 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller confirmed friday that the 
vice president also favors ending the negotiations and bringing 
kozak back to washington 
reports last week of the administrations willingness to dismiss 
the indictments generated political turmoil here the senate voted 
8610 against that concession 
us apprehensions about noriega were heightened on thursday 
when a progovernment newspaper published photographs of us 
embassy employees and their families so that panamanians will 
know the gringos who are starving us to death a reference to 
us economic sanctions against panama 
the supplement in the newspaper critica a propaganda organ of 
the government said the americans think the walls of their 
embassy are impregnable 
state department spokesman charles redman said the supplement 
has been noted with concern and that appropriate security 
measures have been taken 
he declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any 
americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated

a senate republican study group says the 
united states is developing an underclass of unskilled workers 
because displaced laborers are not receiving adequate job search 
assistance training counseling or benefits 
the senate republican conference task force on education and job 
training in a report released friday said congress should enact a 
980 million education and job training program that consolidates 
two current programs the job training partnership act and the 
trade adjustment assistance act 
the group said the new program would serve an estimated 700000 
workers and seek to eliminate some of the costly duplication of 
effort as well as the delays by the current certification 
process 
the new program would also provide substantially greater 
emphasis on actual retraining the report said workers who are 
unable to find new jobs which utilize their existing skills require 
programs that offer opportunities to update their skills or to 
retrain for new occupations 
the task force report said of the more than one million american 
workers displaced annually more than onethird of them have 
extended periods of unemployment while some never return to the 
work force 
of those who do return almost onehalf take pay cuts according 
to the study group which was chaired by sen john h chafee rri 
the united states is faced with the creation of a growing 
underclass increasingly made up of former manufacturing and 
industrial workers without the skills to enter the work place 
the report said 
the report said projections for the next 15 years indicate that 
millions of americans are not only illprepared for existing jobs 
but will have even more difficulty in the future unless the work 
force is retrained and continuously prepared for marketplace 
change 
the gop conference is an organization made of all 46 republican 
senators

the bahamian government has its own 
ideas about the property of carlos lehder rivas whose conviction 
on us cocainesmuggling charges led to a jury ruling that the 
colombian should forfeit his bahamas assets to the united states 
the bahamas whose leader reportedly is a potential target of 
the lehder trial prosecutor plans to move to confiscate lehders 
property itself according to a statement released friday by the 
bahamas information service 
the bahamas has laws that allow it to confiscate the land of 
those convicted of drug trafficking outside the bahamas and it will 
use these provisions to confiscate lehders bahamian assets the 
statement said 
the statement lauded lehders conviction thursday of charges 
that he smuggled about 33 tons of cocaine from colombia to the 
united states via the bahamas 
a week ago the bahamian government took out fullpage 
advertisements in several major us newspapers rebutting charges 
by some us officials and news media that it hasnt done enough to 
stop drug smuggling and that its officials were bribed by smugglers 
a federal jury found lehder guilty of all 11 counts ranging 
from conspiracy to import cocaine to engaging in a continuing 
criminal enterprise lehder has been identified as a leader of the 
violent medellin cartel of colombia 
the panel deliberated another 10 hours friday on a second phase 
of the trial that resulted in the forfeiture of lehders bahamian 
assets 
the convicted drug smuggler owned a large portion of normans 
cay a bahamian island about 40 miles southeast of nassau his 
holdings included a 3000foot airstrip three homes on normans 
cay and a condominium in nassau lehder 38 paid about 13 
million for the property in the late 1970s and prosecutors said 
lehder used normans cay as his smuggling base us attorney 
robert w merkle called it an aircraft carrier of cocaine 
the island is wrecked but that is not to say it would not be 
of some future value merkle said after the verdict on forfeiture 
assistant us attorney ernst mueller had urged the jury to 
require lehder to forfeit all his bahamian assets 
us district judge howell w melton set sentencing for july 20 
lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and 350000 in 
fines codefendant jack carlton reed who was found guilty on one 
count of conspiracy faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars and 
25000 in fines 
but lehder attorney edward shohat told melton after the jury was 
dismissed that under the uscolombia treaty in existence at the 
time of lehders extradition his client should face a maximum of 
only 30 years in prison merkle disagreed and the judge asked both 
sides to submit briefs on the question 
merkle refused to comment on reports that bahamian prime 
minister lynden o pindling who trial witnesses said received 
milliondollar bribes from lehder is his next target 
pindling and his aides have denied the allegations but have 
said they understand a florida grand jury is investigating the 
matter 
lehder was extradited to the united states last year after a 
firefight and his arrest by the colombian army at a medellin 
mansion 
us drug enforcement officials have warned that while ledhers 
conviction is important it alone will not stop the narcotics flow 
youve got an awful lot of heads on the hydra you have to cut 
off us coast guard lt cmdr jim simpson said friday lehder 
was one of them 
the medellin cartel still ships up to 80 percent of us cocaine 
imports the dea considered lehder one of the four managers of the 
cartel until his arrest early last year the others have evaded 
and sometimes defied colombian and us justice

the reagan administrations dealings with panamanian gen manuel 
antonio noriega continue to attract attention on the presidential 
campaign trail as michael dukakis demands an explanation and 
george bush tries to distance himself from the policies of his boss 
democratic frontrunner dukakis campaigning in california said 
friday that somebody in the administration is going to have to 
tell the american people who it was who thought it was in the 
interests of the american people and this country that we do 
business with somebody who was a known drug peddler and who was 
suspected of murder 
unless and until we have that explanation im not going to be 
satisfied said dukakis who has focused on the reagan 
administration drug policy and dealings with noriega as he 
campaigns in advance of californias crucial june 7 primary 
us and panamanian officials on friday reportedly reached a 
tentative agreement for noriegas departure from the central 
american nation in august in exchange for dropping drug charges 
against him in the united states 
according to an administration source who disclosed the 
tentative agreement bush already has registered his objections to 
the plan 
dukakis democratic rival jesse jackson repeated his criticism 
of us negotiations with noriega but made no reference to the 
reported tentative agreement 
the american people have received too much talk and too little 
information about whats going on concerning dealings with 
noriega jackson said at a church rally in san francisco 
noriega is not plea bargaining with reagan and bush reagan 
and bush are plea bargaining with noriega jackson told more than 
500 supporters at the rally 
jackson was scheduled to appear at a shipyard rally with labor 
groups in the san pedro port of los angeles today 
bush was saying nothing publicly on noriega but the vice 
presidents chief of staff craig fuller issued a statement friday 
confirming published reports that the vice president favors 
ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy back to washington 
fullers statement issued before the latest tentative deal was 
disclosed was the closest bush has come to publicly disagreeing 
with president reagany over the administrations panamanian policy 
two days earlier bush said without mentioning noriega by name 
that he would not negotiate with accused drug runners in this 
country or on foreign soil 
the subject of panama and drugs arose again friday when another 
bush aide donald gregg said in a sworn court deposition that 
during a december 1983 meeting the president of panama told bush 
about allegations of drug running among panamanian officials and 
also told the vice president the stories were untrue 
the vice president said he had not been aware of the charges 
or he would have raised them during the session gregg testified 
in a deposition taken in washington for a private civil lawsuit 
in atlanta the democrats top hired gun opened fire on bush on 
another front calling him a quintessential elitist establishment 
republican countryclubber and a donothing public official 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk said during a 
meeting of the association of democratic state chairs that bush is 
a mere functionary applauding in the dark shadows of this 
republican administration as it turns thumbs down on public ethics 
thumbs down on the civil rights restoration act thumbs down on a 
simple 60days notice to working men and women who are about to 
lose their jobs 
the challenge for democrats is to make sure that when people 
go to the polls in november george bush will have a rendezvous 
with his own record kirk told the party leaders 
democrats also took up the issue of military spending as the 
partys platform committee met friday in suburban washington 
california rep ronald dellums told the panel a significant 
wing of the party shares the jackson campaigns view that 
pentagon budgets should be trimmed by 200 billion over the next 
four years 
i represent a point of view that is a significant wing of the 
democratic party said dellums i dont believe that we can 
tiptoe into the white house i dont believe that we can 
continue to play the game of me too on defense spending 
either were a party advocating peace or were a party 
advocating war dellums added 
but two democratic senators who are mentioned as possible 
running mates r frontrunner michael dukakis john glenn of ohio 
and sam nunn of georgia told the committee the party must stand 
for a strong national defense

an unprecedented soviet newspaper article 
describes life as being so demeaning and dreary in one womens 
penal colony on the volga river that inmates are driven to drugs 
and lesbianism 
a prisoner identified only as kutsyenkova a former college 
lecturer told the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya of the desperation 
among prisoners in corrective labor womens colony no 6515 in 
kuybyshev 620 miles southeast of moscow 
the regime of the colony gives rise to a destructive process 
in a woman says kutsyenkova whose crime leading to her 
imprisonment was not disclosed in the article 
marching in formation ugly clothes banging of iron 
commands meatless diet this makes one insipid dull leads one 
to search for emotional relief at any price 
inmates could fight off a breakdown for five years at the 
most kutsyenkova says in the friday article but then the 
organism catastrophically weakens and convicts seek solace in 
smoking lesbianism and narcotics 
the prisoner experiences an atrophy of will and initiative a 
growing of uncontrollable rage says the woman whose doctoral 
dissertation had been about the family 
according to the article punishment of prisoners often 
backfires causing them to get into more trouble instead of leading 
them to rehabilitation 
some inmates dont want to be freed after serving long prison 
terms because they no longer have families on the outside 
kutsyenkova said the article told of two freed prisoners who slept 
for several nights right outside the colony praying to be taken 
back because they could no longer live on their own 
it was one of the first articles about conditions in womens 
prison camps conditions at the soviet unions notorious penal 
colonies and labor camps for men described in the books of exile 
alexander solzhenitsyn were once taboo subjects for soviet news 
media 
however the policy of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev of 
open discussion of the nations problems has produced reports 
exposing deficiencies in the criminal justice system 
alexander v vlasov who as minister of internal affairs 
oversees the prisons acknowledged in a commentary accompanying the 
article that improvements are needed 
quite a few problems have piled up in the system of corrective 
labor institutions perestroika is needed also in this sphere in 
which the human factor should be made predominant too he writes 
perestroika is gorbachevs term for his overhauling of soviet 
society 
the article said inmates of corrective labor womens colony no 
6515 had murdered husbands and children taken bribes or engaged 
in other forms of corruption sovietskaya rossiya said one woman 
had been an engineereconomist another a chief bookkeeper a third 
the director of a large store several had been senior lecturers at 
colleges 
as prisoners they had to work up to 1012 hours a day in sewing 
shops with poor ventilation the article said 
if a prisoner went out without a shawl smoked in a prohibited 
area or said goodnight too loudly to cellmates the punishment might 
be 1015 days in an isolation cell 
vlasov said his ministry was trying to improve the quality of 
its staff at the colonies and labor camps he said new codes were 
being drafted to make the punishment more appropriately fit a 
convicts crime and to provide in some cases for a reduction of 
sentences 
time off for good work and good behavior is being planned as one 
experiment 
vlasov did not specifically address the problems of lesbianism 
and drug addiction among women inmates 
the official tass news agency carried a report a year ago saying 
life in one camp outside moscow was hard but that prisoners were 
treated fairly and given free time and an opportunity to get an 
education 
soviet officials say the camps are designed to make inmates take 
a conscientious attitude toward work and teach them to live by the 
law 
western organizations estimate the camps hold 1 million people

government and rebel leaders have 
agreed to resume peace talks next week before their tenative truce 
expires but remain at odds over where to meet 
jorge rosales spokesman for the ussupported rebels known as 
contras said from miami on friday that rebel leaders had agreed to 
the governments proposal that the third round of talks begin 
wednesday 
he said contra leaders plan to meet with representatives of the 
leftist sandinista government at the southern frontier post of 
sapoa where the sides signed a 60day ceasefire on march 23 
but foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said in a note to rebel 
official roberto ferrey that the meeting must be held in managua 
to meet outside the capital would be to go back on the 
advances that with great difficulties have been achieved he 
said in the letter released by the presidential press office 
the contras have objected to keeping the talks in managua where 
the first two rounds were held because they said their movements 
were restricted by the sandinista government the rebels said they 
were unable freely meet with domestic opposition leaders 
the sides are trying to forge a lasting peace under the sapoa 
accords which provided for the temporary truce that expires may 30 
and promised the contras a role in the political future of a more 
democratic nicaragua 
but little progress appears to have been made and rebel fighters 
have been reluctant to move into designated ceasefire zones agreed 
to by negotiators 
tinoco told reporters friday that the government had proposed 
halting the fighting for another month but the rebels have not 
responded the sandinistas have threatened to mount a major 
offensive if the truce is not extended 
the contra leadership has in the past month suffered from 
infighting over the military leadership of col enrique bermudez 
but rebel officials now say the rifts have been healed 
on friday a costa rican official said bermudez would attend 
next weeks peace talks he has not previously taken part in the 
discussions 
sources say thousands of rebel fighters have moved toward the 
border with honduras through which the us agency for 
international development is providing them humanitarian aid 
as part of the sapoa accords rebel fighters have been permitted 
to receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization 
the sandinistas have said the insurgents can receive food 
medicine and clothes distributed by the international red cross 
but the contras rejected that saying the organization sympathizes 
with the government 
meanwhile the government on friday temporarily barred 
churchrun radio catolica from airing a news program that had 
broadcast an interview with a rebel chief 
the interior ministry said in a statement that the station 
should have cleared the interview with the government and that the 
news program could not resume broadcasting until tuesday 
radio catolica and two other privately owned radio stations were 
temporarily prohibited from broadcasting news programs earlier this 
month because of their reports on a workers strike

a baby sitter who killed one child and 
wounded five others before killing herself was remembered by some 
as a quiet woman who loved children while others recalled an 
eccentric with deep psychological problems 
she was a sort of a dr jekyll and mr hyde in that she had 
mood swings up and down said john childs whose former 
girlfriend lori wasserman dann was found dead in a barricaded 
house after the shooting spree that began friday at an elementary 
school she also wounded a 20yearold man 
ms dann 30 had her own idiosyncracies said childs 34 
she loved children for example but had little compassion for 
handicapped people he said 
ms danns parents feel absolutely destroyed by this said 
herbert timm the police chief in this affluent chicago suburb 
only a caretaker answered the phone at the home of her parents 
norman and edith wasserman 
ms dann had some very deep psychological problems and had 
been seeing a psychiatrist timm said she also had earlier brushes 
with the police in illinois and wisconsin 
after the shooting rampage she telephoned her parents 
i have hurt some children ive done a bad thing im sorry 
please help me she said according to timm she later shot 
herself once in the head with a 32caliber pistol 
in madison wis where ms dann lived during the past year 
people remembered her as an eccentric 
she was dubbed the elevator woman because she rode the 
elevator for extended periods night and day in the highrise 
residence where she lived earlier this year keith wilson recalled 
in a telephone interview with the wisconsin state journal 
wilson now a los angeles resident lived across the hall from 
her in the building near the university of wisconsin campus 
another acquaintance brian soifer told wmaq radio i never 
really saw her talk to anybody never saw her eat dinner with 
anybody she watched tv all the time

school said 
i had to move out because i couldnt live with her former 
roommate lois wander told the journal from her home in highland 
park she was always very weird

i am terribly terribly shocked its unbelievable said 
childs mother alexandra who recalled that ms dann visited her 
home half a dozen times when she was dating her son often playing 
with her grandchildren 
the wassermans live around the corner from the childs family in 
a large white onestory ranch house in glencoe a north shore 
suburb of about 9000 residents that is the nations 
20thwealthiest suburb with a percapita income of 35632 per year 
she was a pretty girl intelligent but reticent a listener 
more than a talker mrs childs said she might have been a 
little different than average but not in my wildest dreams could i 
have imagined this 
craig bayless of winnetka a realestate broker remembered ms 
dann as a fine baby sitter who looked after his daughter 
several times last summer

an appeals court has reduced the prison 
sentences of three solidarity activists jailed during this past 
months widespread labor unrest the two still being held are to be 
freed on wednesday 
gdansk activists bogdan lis and czeslaw nowak arrested may 4 on 
charges of urging strikes in the baltic port city on friday had 
jail terms reduced from three months to three weeks 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz originally 
sentenced may 7 to six weeks in prison but freed monday pending 
appeal was instead ordered to perform 20 hours of public service 
the three were arrested during more than two weeks of strikes 
and street protests that ended may 10 
the protests triggered in part by steep price increases posed 
the most serious challenge to polands communist leaders since 
their 1981 martial law crackdown on solidarity 
government spokesman jerzy urban said one day after the final 
strike ended peacefully may 10 at the lenin shipyard in gdansk that 
the government would follow a nonrepressive policy toward the 
strikers 
the last of 38 strikers arrested may 5 when police stormed the 
strikebound nowa huta steelworks in southern poland were freed 
monday 
solidarity leader lech walesa said even the shortened sentences 
meted out by the appeals court friday were unjustified 
i dont know what to think about these sentences he said 
from his home in gdansk it is ridiculous 
onyszkiewicz had been charged with spreading false information 
intended to cause public unrest the mathematics instructor at 
warsaw university said he was put on trial as a warning to people 
not to speak to the western press 
this is glasnost polishstyle he said 
solidarity the only independent labor federation ever allowed 
in the soviet bloc was banned in 1982

a jury awarded 15 million to a man 
who claimed his marriage was destroyed by a lesbian nun who seduced 
his wife and that church officials did nothing to prevent it 
steve woolverton sued former sister mary kregar and the catholic 
diocese of brownsville alleging that an affair between ms kregar 
and his wife mary woolverton broke up his 12year marriage in 
1984 
woolvertons personalinjury lawsuit filed in 1986 also 
claimed church officials were negligent by allowing ms kregar to 
serve as a nun in port isabel and continue serving there after 
woolverton told them of the affair 
the jury has returned a verdict finding not only the conduct 
on the part of the nun was negligent as we had stated in our 
lawsuit but also the conduct on the part of the parish priest in 
not attending and responding to this in a timely fashion edwin 
randolph fleuriet woolvertons lawyer said after fridays verdict 
ms kregar came to our lady star of the sea church in port 
isabel in september 1983 and became director of the choir for 
which mrs woolverton played the guitar ms kregar left the 
franciscan order of nuns in august 1984 
the woolvertons who have three children separated in may 1984 
and woolverton claimed in his suit filed two years later that ms 
kregar used her fiduciary position of trust to commence a 
seduction of plaintiffs wife 
jurors deliberated for five hours before awarding woolverton 
500000 in actual damages 500000 in exemplary damages from ms 
kregar and 500000 in exemplary damages from the diocese 
the rev ben verbrugge then parish priest bishop john j 
fitzpatrick ms kregar and sister cecilia rolling a nun at the 
port isabel church were found guilty of gross negligence by 
failing to intervene in the matter after woolverton told the priest 
of the lesbian relationship 
although woolverton had sought 5 million in damages fleuriet 
said he was pleased with the judgment 
defense lawyers never denied that there had been an affair 
between mrs woolverton and ms kregar most of the trial testimony 
took the form of videotaped depositions from ms kregar mrs 
woolverton church officials and a family friend 
darrell barger lead attorney for the diocese contended during 
the trial that the suit was for money money money and that 
when bishop fitzpatrick became convinced of the lesbian 
relationship in march 1984 he acted quickly to remove the nun 
ms kregar left the rochester minnbased order in august 1984 
by a mutual decision primarily because of her inability to 
lead a celibate life said sister mary franchon pirkl executive 
councillor of the franciscan order 
woolverton said he convinced the bishop of the relationship with 
a secretly recorded conversation between his wife and the nun 
described as sexual in nature he also employed a private 
investigator to watch his wife 
woolverton now lives in durango colo his exwife lives 
elsewhere in that city with their children and ms kregar is a 
social worker in pueblo colo 
im glad its over for everybody woolverton said im 
going back with my kids and help raise them

gov rose mofford has defended her 
expenditure of thousands of dollars in state funds on gifts and 
other items including diet food a 530 watch and a jokewriting 
service 
the maricopa county attorneys office said friday it will 
broaden an ongoing investigation into mrs moffords finances while 
she served as secretary of state to include the new disclosures 
mrs mofford declined to answer questions about the disclosures 
friday however in a brief interview with radio station kfyi mrs 
mofford defended the expenditures 
i never misspent a penny mrs mofford told the station 
it was appropriated for vip gifts and i used it for that type of 
purpose i never used anything for personal gain 
as has been the practice to date the items to be purchased 
were also available to the executive legislative and judicial 
branches of government the governors office said in a 
sevenpage statement released late friday 
mrs mofford 65 became governor april 4 when elected gov evan 
mecham was convicted in a senate impeachment trial of misusing 
state funds and obstructing justice mecham was automatically 
removed from office 
her chief of staff george cunningham said he had not found any 
record of who received the gifts but would request a legislative 
staff audit to ensure public confidence 
records examined by the associated press showed mrs moffords 
gift expenditures totaled at least 50000 during her last five 
years as secretary of state 
the governor and her aides said the spending had legislative 
authorization but lawmakers and staff budget analysts said they 
were unfamiliar with the authorization 
the state constitution bars the state from giving anything of 
value to an individual without public benefit and state law makes 
unauthorized expenditures of public funds a felony 
house speaker joe lane who launched the impeachment probe of 
mecham said he would wait to hear from attorney general bob corbin 
and maricopa county attorney tom collins before deciding whether to 
launch a similar investigation of mrs mofford 
since corbin is next in line to succeed mrs mofford he has 
turned over to collins an investigation of her financial disclosure 
practices that investigation stemmed from an ap report that while 
secretary of state she had failed to include a number of her 
business dealings in the staterequired reports 
mrs mofford used state funds to pay for such things as 
paintings watches indian kachina dolls clocks flags and 
knickknacks typically charging them to other operating 
expenses or supplies 
the legislatures official records show 2400 in unspecified 
other expenses for the secretary of state was approved in 1980 
and 2500 in 1981 more recently the legislature provided 
lumpsum allocations for the operation of the secretary of states 
office with little direction as to how the funds were to be divided 
cunningham said mrs mofford believed the legislature had 
granted her giftgiving authority and had actually expanded its 
scope from her original request for visiting dignitaries to 
encompass arizonans as well 
a 1978 protocolfund statute allows the governor house speaker 
and senate president to make gifts that promote state interests and 
encourage public service it does not include the secretary of 
state but cunningham and other aides say the legislatures 
approval of the 2400 was the equivalent of including her 
earlier this month mrs mofford said that when faced with the 
need to present gifts to important visitors as secretary of state 
she took care of it myself 
the gifts resulted in a public benefit because they promoted 
good will for the state cunningham said 
he said the jokeservice helped spice up mrs moffords speeches 
and likened it to a reference book he said the diet food appeared 
to be bee pollen capsules manufactured in arizona that mrs mofford 
was using to promote state agriculture

the dress code at tricounty north high 
school allows miniskirts but requires shorts to extend below the 
kneecaps for both boys and girls 
unfair say some of the schools males so theyve taken the 
only reasonable step as hot weather approaches 
theyre wearing miniskirts too 
more than two dozen young men wore borrowed miniskirts to school 
friday to show their disdain for the code 
we feel that it is unfair that girls can wear miniskirts but 
we are not allowed to wear shorts that come past our knees if 
theyre going to have a school dress code they should make it 
equal said the leader of the protest senior jason gourlas 
whose hot pink miniskirt went past midthigh 
betty hawkins a junior agreed 
if the girls can wear short skirts and show off everything 
they have why cant the guys wear shorts she asked 
principal carl walter said his hands are tied 
the school cannot be run as a democracy theyre here to 
get an education and those guidelines were set by the board of 
education elected by the people since im hired by the board i 
follow the rule he said 
but walter added he had no problem with male skirtwearers as 
long as they did not create disruptions he acknowledged that the 
skirts were shorter than the required length for shorts but said 
rules are rules

a judge has dismissed charges that east 
st louis is endangering its police officers saying the court does 
not have the authority to tell the povertystricken city how to run 
its police department 
the ruling friday by st clair county associate judge robert 
lechien was a setback for county states attorney john baricevic 
who had charged the city with eight counts of reckless conduct for 
not providing police with properly working cars 
baricevic had said it was the first time an illinois city was 
charged with criminal violations 
lechien rejected the charges 
the authority over budgetary priority clearly lies with the 
aldermanic council of the city of east st louis lechien wrote 
in his order for this court to engage in realignment of the 
citys priorities would constitute judicial encroachment of 
legislative power 
baricevic was out of town friday and could not be reached for 
comment 
east st louis alderman clarence ellis said he wasnt surprised 
by the ruling 
being a lawyer i think he should have known he didnt have 
any jurisdiction in this case ellis said but he may have 
helped us he made us more conscious of the importance of having an 
effective police force he was concerned and i want him to 
continue to be concerned 
if convicted on all eight counts the city could have faced 
fines of up to 8000 
during a twoday trial last week east st louis corporate 
counsel sam ross contended no state law requires the city to supply 
its police officers with working radios and cars 
twentysix officers testified they were not assigned police 
radios or cars or received broken equipment 
witnesses also testified that city officials knew about the 
deterioration of police radios and patrol cars and that about 
10000 in city funds was spent on such things as newspaper 
advertisements including a reelection ad for mayor carl e 
officer 
neither officer nor ross could be reached for comment the 
belleville newsdemocrat reported today

rival shiite moslem militias today 
pounded each other with howitzers and mortars in beiruts southern 
slums in a 16th day of fighting ignoring iranian efforts to halt 
the bloodshed 
police said five people were killed and 41 wounded in the 
fighting between the iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or 
party of god and syrias main lebanese ally the amal militia 
by police count that raised the casualty toll to 258 killed and 
855 wounded since the battle for control of the labyrinthine slums 
erupted may 6 
most of the 18 foreign hostages captured in lebanon by moslem 
extremists half of them americans are believed held in the 
slums 
in nearby palestinian refugee camps yasser arafats fatah plo 
faction dislodged syrianbacked rivals of fatahuprising after 
nightlong fighting police said the rival factions have clashed 
several times in recent days for control of the camps 
the fatahuprising fighters led by dissident col saeed mousa 
sought refuge today in syriancontrolled territory on the edges of 
the camps said a police spokesman who by regulation cannot be 
named 
the syrians have made no move to aid faction which opposes 
reconciliation moves between the palestine liberation organization 
led by arafat and syrian president hafez assad to end a 5yearold 
feud 
the thud of exploding shells resounded across beirut today as 
hezbollah and amal arabic for hope battled in the 16squaremile 
southern slums 
efforts to contain the fighting have shifted to damascus where 
acting foreign minister ali mohammed besharati of iran met with 
assad and delivered a message on the crisis from president ali 
khamenei of iran 
the official syrian arab news agency reported on the meeting 
friday night but did not disclose the contents of khameneis 
message 
brig gen ghazi kenaan chief of syrias military intelligence 
in lebanon was also in the syrian capital to consult with his 
superiors a source at the syrian command in beirut said 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said kenaan was 
expected to return to beirut today or sunday to pursue his 
efforts with the warring factions he did not elaborate 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah hezbollahs spiritual guide 
was quoted by beiruts independent annahar daily today as saying 
discussions in damascus may be decisive in determining the next 
step in south beirut 
vernon walters the us ambassador to the united nations was 
also in damascus today waiting to meet with assad 
walters said friday that the visit was not specifically for 
the hostages still he was expected to discuss syrian efforts to 
free the hostages the longestheld being terry anderson 
associated press chief middle east correspondent he was seized 
march 16 1985 
amal claimed friday that it had foiled a plan by hezbollah to 
trade an unidentified hostage for arms and ammunition from the 
lebanese forces the christians main militia 
hezbollah and the lebanese forces denied there had been any such 
deal 
syria has had 7500 troops and 500 tanks massed on the southern 
western and northern edges of the embattled southern slums since 
sunday 
but its officers say a decision to move in to quell the fighting 
has been delayed to give political efforts a chance to arrange a 
settlement 
besharatis efforts to arrange a ceasefire have apparently 
failed but it was not known when the syrians might send in their 
troops 
frances le monde newspaper on friday quoted kenaan as saying 
the entry of the syrian army into south beirut is inevitable 
for the moment we are simply allowing time for the 
negotiators to reach a political agreement which would be the best 
solution for our entry 
syria the main power broker in lebanon is irans principal 
ally in the 7yearold persian gulf war against iraq a longtime 
syrian rival 
the syrians have been alarmed by irans efforts through 
hezbollah to dominate lebanons 12 million shiites the largest 
single sect in this country ravaged by nearly 13 years of civil war 
but diplomatic sources believe neither damascus nor tehran want 
a major confrontation in lebanon right now 
the iranians have suffered a string of military and economic 
setbacks in the gulf and the syrians in trouble economically 
themselves need the free oil that iran gives them

the arrests of three teengers foiled an 
alleged plot to blow up illinois river bridges using 2400 stolen 
blasting caps police say 
lt jerry sample of the peoria county sheriffs department 
said friday he took the threat very seriously and kept the 
information quiet until after the arrests were made to avoid panic 
the kids who stole the dynamite caps were telling other kids 
about it and they made comments about their plans to blow up 
bridges sample said i didnt take it as a joke at the time 
and they certainly didnt tell us it was a joke during 
interrogation 
late last week police arrested the three 17yearolds kenneth 
johnson tyrone gayton and christopher caho all of peoria in 
connection with the may 9 theft of 2400 blasting caps from a rural 
pottstown site 
the caps are owned by a mining equipment and supply company 
some are fused caps which are extremely sensitive to shock and 
others are electric caps that can be detonated by radio 
transmissions police said 
the teens were in peoria county jail charged with burglary and 
theft police said bond ranged from 5000 to 10000 
in an interview from jail johnson said he was joking when he 
told friends he might blow up a bridge he said he planned to sell 
the caps 
sample said its unclear whether the caps would have been 
powerful enough to blow up a bridge 
the experts said that if you take 1000 caps and put them 
together you can make a 10foot crater in the ground sample 
said whether they would hurt a steel bridge we dont know 
all but about 60 of the stolen caps were recovered sample said

former president carlos andres perez 
says the united states would look silly if it were to drop drug 
charges against gen manuel antonio noriega in exchange for his 
stepping down as panamas leader 
it would be a scandal perez said in an interview it 
would make the us look ridiculous 
earlier this year perez claimed he had negotiated a deal by 
which noriega would leave power but that deposed president eric 
delvalle of panama upset the agreement by trying to fire noriega on 
feb 26 
perez said the apparent us effort to negotiate noriegas exit 
after economic pressures to remove him failed leaves us amazed 
but he agreed that noriega leader of panamas 15000strong 
defense forces would have to give up power if democracy is to 
prevail in panama 
to create continuity in panamas democracy it is convenient 
to lower the influence of the military perez said that 
includes noriega 
the former president currently the frontrunner for venezuelas 
presidential election in december says he feels he could still 
help in mediating a solution to panamas political crisis

militant sikh separatists massacred nine 
sleeping hindu laborers in punjab state today as the guerrillas 
kept up their bloody campaign to avenge a police siege on their 
sacred golden temple 
the attack raised to 200 the number of deaths blamed on sikh 
extremists since may 9 when government forces besieged the temple 
sikhisms holiest shrine 
on friday police fanned out across the northern state and 
raided sikh hideouts in an effort to blunt the wave of violence 
prompted by the 10day siege on the amritsar temple that ended 
wednesday 
today the committee of sikh elders that oversees the temple 
agreed to cooperate with government efforts to prevent militants 
from again turning the temple into an armed stronghold on friday 
it had refused to cooperate 
committee member shiv singh khushipuri said the group decided 
today to restrict visitors from bringing weapons into the temple 
complex and prevent people from living in the offices that surround 
the temple 
sikh extremists in the past have used the offices to hide from 
police 
but khushipuri repeated the committees demand that police free 
four militant sikh priests arrested may 12 when they defied a 
curfew and tried to march on the shrine 
he said that only the priests could resume religious rites at 
the temple which have been suspended for nearly two weeks 
at least 42 people mostly sikh guerrillas were killed during 
the siege on the 400yearold temple four sikhs committed suicide 
rather than surrender 
sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for 
more political autonomy or an independent homeland in punjab for 
their minority sect they claim sikhs are discriminated against by 
indias majority hindus 
sikhs comprise less than 2 percent of indias 800 million people 
but are a majority in punjab their religion was founded about 500 
years ago as an alternative to hinduism and islam 
killings of civilians by sikh separatists escalated sharply in 
1987 and 1988 despite efforts by police and paramilitary troops to 
blunt the crusade 
early today about six sikhs armed with automatic rifles opened 
fire on sleeping workers in the village of gujarpura about 18 
miles northwest of amritsar said chaman lal inspector general of 
the border security force 
nine workers were killed and three wounded he said 
it was the third such raid on a hindu migrant workers camp 
since tuesday when 30 workers were slain as they slept at a camp 
near the state capital of chandigarh 
on thursday night sikh extremists ordered hindu migrants at a 
camp in amritsar district to line up against a wall and shot five 
of them to death 
the attacks have prompted an exodus of hundreds of the hindu 
laborers who traditionally migrate from the northern states of 
bihar and orissa to work on farms in punjab indias richest 
agricultural state 
indian newspapers have speculated that the sikh extremists are 
trying to destroy the states economy by driving away farm labor 
the latest killings raised to at least 1136 the number of 
people slain by sikh extremists in punjab this year last year 
1030 people were killed 
punjab has been placed under a police alert on friday 9000 
police and paramilitary troops were sent out across the state to 
protect citizens and raid the hideouts of sikh extremists in three 
border districts 
the order came after at least 38 people were killed during raids 
late thursday and early friday 
attacks friday included numerous bombings in the town of 
pathankot in the northernmost part of punjab several bombs went 
off in buses and five people were killed the town was put under 
curfew after the bombings

nine hijackers who seized a kuwait airways boeing 747 on april 5

authorities in algiers the jumbo jets third stop in the 17day 
drama in return for what diplomats said was safe conduct to an 
undisclosed country

linked to lebanons iranianbacked shiite hezbollah or party of 
god had gone to lebanon but their whereabouts have not been 
officially confirmed 
the paper did not say on which side the alleged hijackers had 
been fighting in beirut

former aides and staff members have said rep 
gerry sikorski dminn expected them to run personal errands and 
to campaign for the congressman sometimes at taxpayer expense 
said published reports today 
the washington post and the st paul pioneer press dispatch said 
in todays editions that former staff members complained about 
personal services they performed for sikorski and his family like 
washing dishes shoveling snow and transporting his daughter to and 
from school 
staffers told the post some of these tasks were done during 
times they were being paid their government salaries 
sikorski contacted early today by the associated press said 
no personal requests were made authorized or approved for any 
of his former or current staff members 
he said some aides were personal friends who had volunteered 
on occasion to take care of personal tasks 
sikorski characterized the reported allegations as 
inaccurate and a firstclass hatchet job 
the threeterm congressman said the charges had been initiated 
by a disgruntled employee who had been terminated from his 
congressional staff 
dennis m mcgrann sikorkskis administrative assistant said 
i do know that the post was informed that the allegations 
innuendos and many outright lies contained in the story came from 
an individual who was terminated from the staff who vowed revenge 
mcgrann identified the former staffer as rick shapiro who he 
said worked in sikorskis washington office for 7 months before he 
was terminated for nonperformance 
shapiro could not be reached for comment 
an unidentified former staffer told the star tribune that 
sikorskis office has had high turnover since the congressman first 
took office in 1983 i only know of one or two people who left on 
good terms the former staffer told the minneapolis paper 
he said sikorski has a reputation as being a perfectionist and 
difficult to work for adding he sometimes criticizes staff members 
in front of others 
sikorski admitted i have lost my temper and said he 
expects much from his employees 
we work hard he said we accomplish a lot we work long 
hours thats the way i was raised but the relationship is 
much more positive and friendly than many people are led to 
believe 
the post reported that several staff members and others familiar 
with sikorskis office most of whom it did not identify said he 
had a member of his staff shovel snow off the sidewalk near his 
capitol hill home last year 
ione yates who worked as an executive assistant in the 
minnesota democrats office in 1983 and 1984 told the post once 
i remember staff was sent over to the house to do the dishes 
i just got tired of feeling like a piece of property yates 
added 
sikorski also sent some employees from his legislative office in 
washington to minnesota to help his 1986 reelection campaign while 
they were paid their regular government salaries the post said 
citing house records and former staffers 
legislative staff people do not give up their right to 
participate in politics as long as they put in their hours in 
their official duties said sikorski he said if his staff 
members did any politicking they did it on their own time 
the st paul pioneer press dispatch also reported that several 
former staff members complained about being asked to complete 
personal tasks for sikorski such as escorting his daughter home 
from school taking her lunch and tending his wifes dogs 
on one rare occasion my daughter was injured at school and a 
staff person without asking and without being asked brought her 
back to the office sikorski told the associated press 
he said one staff member who was a family friend before joining 
the office asked to help care for the dogs and has been 
compensated by susan sikorski

a leading communist party reformer 
today urged a greater voice for hungarians in national affairs in a 
party conference that has become a showdown between reformers and 
longtime party leader janos kadar 
where we have democracy we can really have renewal central 
committee member imre pozsgay told delegates during the second day 
of debate at the first national party conference in 31 years 
pozsgays remarks came a day after kadar delivered a spirited 
defense of singleparty rule and blistering criticism for political 
change that he said would undermine party control 
kadars assault on reformers within the party clearly was aimed 
at pozsgay and other advocates of political change who have 
expressed support for independent political and trade union groups 
that are demanding more of a voice in hungarys affairs 
diplomats have speculated that kadar would be asked to step down 
when the conference concludes sunday 
the consensus is hardening that kadar will go said a 
western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but he said that kadar who turns 76 next week is a wily and 
experienced politician who still could have firm support among 
party conservatives 
earlier today premier karoly grosz a leading contender to 
succeed kadar urged party unity but said it must rid itself of 
ideological prejudices 
while pozsgay did not refer to the proliferation of independent 
political groups directly much of the speech focused on the need 
to allow more grassroots participation in party decisions 
people dont just want to implement party resolutions they 
want to participate in the preparations and policy making said 
pozsgay 
we need greater freedoms to build a democratic socialism 
we must do away with barriers or barriers will destroy us 
pozsgay has said in earlier speeches that he supports 
constitutional changes to guarantee the independence of interest 
groups outside the party 
kadars address indicated he has no intention of yielding to 
such demands and was considered an attack on the recent formation 
of hungarys first independent trade union and efforts by students 
to set up an unofficial democratic youth group 
grosz 57 seemed to defend the oneparty rule saying those who 
demand more parties in hungary do not reckon with the fact that 
this is not a matter of decision but conditional on the real 
social possibilities 
if the party is paralyzed then the country will be paralyzed 
and everyone will be the losers grosz said 
but grosz said the party should break with the practice of 
secretiveness selfisolation and inflexible working style 
kadar and grosz both acknowledged the countrys economic 
problems which include 185 percent inflation in the first quarter 
of this year and an 18 billion foreign debt 
kadar who took power in 1956 after the kremlin crushed a 
popular uprising increasingly has been blamed for the nationss 
economic problems and for resisting political changes 
austerity measures imposed earlier this year have angered many 
hungarians and reformers say economic innovations cannot be 
achieved without sweeping political changes 
the conference meanwhile elected a 34member nominating 
committee to select candidates for the new central committee which 
now has 106 members 
the central committee in turn nominates candidates for the 
politburo where changes are also expected 
politburo member janos berecz said personnel changes will be 
announced in a live radio and television broadcast sunday

secretary of state george p shultz urged prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to accept an international peace conference 
and give up occupied territory for middle east peace 
the agenda as we see it has to be territory for peace 
shultz said in an interview broadcast today by israel radio if 
you say no then there is no arab partner that wants to come and 
negotiate because they say what is there to negotiate 
shultz was interviewed friday in washington 
the army imposed a curfew on parts of gaza city this morning 
after palestinians demonstrated a military spokesman said he did 
not elaborate 
an arab reporter said there was a full general strike throughout 
the gaza strip and scattered stonethrowing clashes between soldiers 
and protesters he said at least three palestinians were beaten by 
israeli troops 
both the military spokesman and reporter spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
since antioccupation unrest broke out dec 8 in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip israeli soldiers have killed 191 
palestinians two israelis also have been killed 
shultz stopped short of directly criticizing shamir but he said 
the united states and the israeli leader disagree on the need to 
give up territory captured during the 1967 middle east war in 
exchange for peace 
disputes remain on the international peace conference and the 
timetable of negotiations 
everybody has views that they hold and which we discuss 
said shultz some of the things that the prime minister feels 
about the proposals weve put on the table of course we dont agree 
with 
shultz urged the israeli government to accept his peace 
proposal which includes a call for an international peace 
conference and negotiations on palestinian demands for selfrule 
the status quo is not stable is not satisfactory shultz 
said 
shultz has visited the middle east twice since drawing up his 
peace proposal and is due back again in june 
israels coalition government is split on the proposals 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes the plan while the leftist 
labor party led by foreign minister shimon peres supports it 
shultz has failed to budge shamir so far egypt is the only 
country to officially endorse the plan but shultz said he would 
keep trying 
its not my initiative or the us initiative thats in 
trouble shultz said its the region thats in trouble and 
thats why i keep coming back 
peres returned friday from washington where he met with shultz 
and president reagan 
in an airport interview he said the soviet union has agreed to 
join an international peace conference on the middle east but 
continues to insist on palestinian selfdetermination 
peres said soviet officials told him they now agreed the 
international conference would not have the power to impose its 
views on israel and its arab negotiating partners 
both shamir and peres reject establishment of an independent 
palestinian state in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
peres met with soviet officials in madrid and washington 
including moscows us ambassador yuri dubinin

a series of political smoke signals from 
dublin and belfast has aroused hopes for a fresh and radically 
different initiative on northern ireland 
if successful it could lead to contacts between irish prime 
minister charles haughey and james molyneaux the leader of 
northern irelands largest protestant party 
a year ago the notion of talks between haughey the proud irish 
nationalist and molyneaux the equally fervent british loyalist 
would have seemed inconceivable 
the mere fact that they sound willing to talk demonstrates how 
much the political atmosphere in both the irish republic and 
northern ireland has changed 
the new departure is rooted in the november 1985 angloirish 
agreement which gave dublin a say in the running of northern 
ireland and a guardianship role over the provinces 40percent 
roman catholic minority 
protestants viewing ireland as a hostile catholicdominated 
state bitterly objected to the agreement fearing the strategy was 
to bring them under dublins rule 
but 2 years later they are conceding failure to topple the 
agreement and are beginning to accept that dublin having gained a 
foothold through the angloirish agreement cannot be excluded from 
any future deal 
i dont think unionists protestants should get themselves 
hung up on this shibboleth that they have created for themselves in 
the past about the relationship with dublin raymond ferguson 
the protestant mayor of the northern ireland town of enniskillen 
said in a television interview 
people like ferguson talk of an irish republicnorthern ireland 
confederation in which catholics and protestants would share power 
in ulster they prefer not to go into detailed proposals at this 
stage dwelling instead on the need for protestants to rethink 
their attitudes toward the irish republic 
irelands and britains membership in the 12nation european 
economic community will take on major significance in 1992 when 
the abolition of most frontier controls will inevitably knit this 
island closer together socially and economically 
the quest for a united ireland is being supplanted by a 
consensus that unity is impossible without protestant consent and 
that this consent does not yet exist 
there is an atmosphere of dialogue john hume leader of 
northern irelands largest catholic faction the social democratic 
and labor party told american correspondents recently 
archbishop robin eames head of the protestant church of 
ireland told a synod tuesday one can sense a new recognition of 
political reality in the air is it just possible that we are 
seeing the first signs of a new and more hopeful chapter in our 
troubled history 
molyneaux 67 gave the cue this spring when he spoke of the 
need for london dublin and northern ireland to start discussing 
irelands future 
haughey responded by saying direct dialogue of this kind 
would be of great significance and would open the way for political 
progress even if only on a limited scale initially 
on may 8 on london weekend television molyneaux suggested an 
exchange of ideas on paper followed by talks between civil 
servants would he meet haughey i dont rule out that at some 
stage it may be desirable molyneaux replied 
the old animosities that used to permeate the language of 
crossborder debate were nowhere in sight 
haughey 62 was at pains to sound conciliatory toward the 
protestants while molyneaux praised haughey as an effective 
politician and castigated those who still harbored a blind 
unreasoning hatred of him 
the overtures have tended to be overshadowed by this years 
upsurge in violence in northern ireland and at this stage few 
will speculate where talks might lead haughey and molyneaux have 
been cautious not to raise any premature hopes 
the irish republican army fighting to drive britain out of 
northern ireland continues to see violent resistance as the only 
answer and hardline protestants may seek to torpedo any 
compromise with dublin 
molyneaux and haughey face a perilous course in undertaking 
any dialogue commented the irish times of dublin but the 
process has to start and soon the alternative is an indefinite 
future of violence

greek divers have plunged 162 feet beneath 
the aegean sea and back into history finding a treasureladen 
turkish warship sunk by greek revolutionaries in 1822 
the remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the 
island of chios in the eastern aegean at a point where historical 
accounts place the sinking of the ottoman ship according to peter 
nicolaides a diver and salvage expert 
the bourloti seimaz or explosives invincible was set 
afire and sunk by greek admiral constantine kanaris in revenge for 
turkish killing and looting on chios 
thousands of islanders died in the turkish raids which shocked 
other nations and swung western european countries behind the greek 
struggle for independence from the ottoman empire greece won 
independence in 1830 
the french painter eugene delacroix produced a famous picture 
the massacre of chios based on the raids 
its an incredible discovery straight out of the history book 
we used to read in school about the war of independence 
nicolaides said in an interview friday with the associated press 
nicolaides who heard about the wreck while teaching an 
underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter started 
querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed 
obstacles 
he pinpointed the wreck on may 3 he said 
when i dived i found ships timbers sticking out of the muddy 
seabed and dozens of objects islamic cooking pots cannon balls 
a candlestick even a chalice from a greek orthodox church he 
said 
the ship was obviously crammed with loot from chios i think 
there may be gold and silver items as well he said i also saw 
what i recognized as human bones he added 
he said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least 100 feet 
in length 
according to historians more than 1000 people including 400 
greek captives were aboard the ship when kanaris staged his 
attack in the early hours of june 7 1822 
the greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of psara towing 
a boat stuffed with explosives its pointed bow was rammed into the 
mouth of a cannon on the bourloti seimaz and a fuse lit 
the ottoman commander admiral kara ali was killed in the blast 
that split the ship kanaris and his crew of greeks escaped 
this is a very significant very emotive find coming from 
this particular period of history said george 
papathanassopoulos the culture ministrys adviser on marine 
archaeology 
papathanassopoulos said the 162foot water depth at the site 
will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology 
rarely is attempted at depths over 113 feet but he said this is 
a ship that must be explored 
nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap american 
and turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international 
project 
american experts from the institute of nautical archaeology at 
texas a amp m university working in cooperation with turkish divers 
have pioneered underwater excavation off the turkish aegean coast 
greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying 
historic wrecks scattered around the aegean and rarely carry out 
excavations

a soviet newspaper painted an unusually 
sympathetic picture saturday of crimean tatars and their attempts 
to return to their ancestral homeland on the black sea 
for tens of thousands of crimean tatars settled today all 
around the country everything connected with their native homes 
the history of the people takes on a special acuteness said 
komsomolskaya pravda the daily of the youth organization komsomol 
while not advocating mass resettlement of the tatars the 
article took a more balanced look than other soviet media at the 
peoples history and problems 
it said authorities in the capital of the crimea simferopol 
were addressing the problems of the crimean tatars and that the 
question of the organized resettlement of part of the tatars in the 
crimea is being settled 
the rights of the soviet unions more than 100 national groups 
is one of the most sensitive issues facing the administration of 
mikhail s gorbachev he has called on the communist partys 
central committee to devote a plenary meeting to the issue which 
includes the recent unrest between the neighboring republics of 
armenia and azerbaijan 
under soviet dictator josef v stalin the crimean tatars were 
deported from their homes on the crimea a peninsula in the 
ukrainian republic that juts into the black sea they were charged 
with betraying their country while the crimea was occupied by nazi 
germany 
according to the article nearly 200000 crimean tatars were 
loaded onto railroad cars and taken to central asia and siberia 
thousands died during the deportation but komsomolskaya pravda did 
not mention this 
the government dropped the collective war crimes charges in 
1967 but the tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the 
crimea 
soviet newspapers usually ignore demonstrations by crimean 
tatars but komsomolskaya pravda recently reported on a meeting in 
midmay of about 100 people outside government offices in 
simferopol 
the group heatedly debated whether the crimean tatars who now 
number about 350000 should be allowed to resettle in their 
homeland 
some of the tatars who met outside the government offices told 
the newspaper they had bought houses in the crimea but that 
authorities refused to recognize their right to reside there 
authorities claim no work is available for the tatars although 
on the wall of the administrative offices are job announcements 
for milkmaids and mechanics the daily said 
according to komsomolskaya pravda nearly 4200 crimean tatars 
have been given permission to resettle in their homeland since 
january shortly before a government commission headed by president 
andrei a gromyko announced new procedures on resettlement 
a government official said march 5 that crimean tatars who are 
the most virtuous and wellproven in work and social life would 
be allowed to return to the crimea crimean tatar activists 
predicted then that only a small number of their countrymen and 
only those who toe the party line would be allowed back 
saturdays article was not the first time komsomolskaya pravda 
reported sympathetically on ethnic issues 
in march the newspaper accused the communist party leadership 
of trying to suppress the sensitive ethnic dispute that continues 
in aremenia and azerbaijan

late last week radical students 
stormed the us embassy in seoul tossing homemade bombs at 
embassy buildings as they sullied american flags the incident was 
not an isolated one 
antiamerican protests are increasing dramatically in south 
korea as radicals blame the united states for everything from 
military rule to dividing the korean peninsula 
radical students and dissidents are singling out the united 
states for harsh criticism as they continue a drive to oust 
president roh taewoo radical leaders demand the expulsion of us 
troops from south korea and an end to all american influence 
drive out the yankees and down with the yankee masters of 
military dictatorship protesters shouted during recent riots in 
seoul and other cities 
they burned us flags and effigies of american leaders 
scattered tens of thousands of leaflets denouncing us policy and 
hurled bombs and firebombs at us diplomatic buildings 
dissidents and radical students who represent a small but 
powerful minority on college campuses portray roh as a front for 
american rule and their antiamericanism has increased as they 
step up their drive to oust the roh government 
it is a fact we cannot ignore that the united states and its 
proxy ruling force roh are primarily responsible for all our 
countrys problems and divisions one radical leader said in a 
speech at a demonstration 
we will never end our struggle until we destroy the roh 
regime a student said during one of the protests 
demonstrators are demanding the removal of about 42000 us 
troops based in south korea under a mutual defense pact against 
communist north korea 
the radicals blame the united states for the partition of the 
korean peninsula and claim that washington is keeping the two 
koreas apart so it can control the south 
protesters have demanded immediate reunification of north and 
south korea they want the two koreas to field a joint team at the 
olympics in seoul as a first step toward unification 
the olympics which should serve as a foundation for opening 
the way for peaceful independent unification has been used by the 
united states to stabilize the military regime and secure its own 
national interests through the permanent partition of the korean 
peninsula said a statement by the hangyore one nation party 
north korea is boycotting the olympics because south korea and 
the international olympic committee will not agree to its demand to 
be a cohost of the games 
radical leaders deny they are pronorth korean they say 
unification is more important then any political consideration and 
insist any problems can be solved after the koreas are reunited 
most koreans are thought to support the us military presence 
and many are appalled at the radicals views 
it torments us to see that many of these selfappointed 
unification promoters seem to ignore the true character of the 
north korean communist clique the korea times said in a may 18 
editorial 
the korean peninsula was divided by us and soviet forces at 
the end of world war ii us forces intervened to help the south 
after the north korean invasion that started the korean war in 1950 
north korea one of the most repressive nations in the world 
has made little secret of its desire to eventually take control of 
the south it has repeatedly launched terrorist attacks against the 
south 
the united states has been the main ally of all south korean 
governments since the korean war washington has tended to push for 
democratic reform while insisting its main concern is defending the 
south against any threat from north korea 
us government leaders have said repeatedly that us forces 
will remain in the south only as long as they are wanted south 
korean leaders say the us troops must stay until the south can 
defend itself alone 
the main south korean opposition parties while rejecting the 
radicals antiamericanism are calling for a smaller us role in 
the country opposition leaders want an end to us command over 
most of the south korean military 
it is nonsense for an american commander to stand above the 
president of korea as far as the operational control over the 
korean armed forces is concerned top opposition leader kim 
youngsam said

seven out of 10 teachers give school reform a 
grade of c or less and half feel that teacher morale has 
declined even though student achievement is up according to a 
nationwide survey released saturday 
overall a majority of the 13500 public school teachers 
surveyed by the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
said that five years of reform had improved the lot of students 
much more than that of teachers 
teaching is a grueling thankless job most people who 
criticize teachers could not long survive in many of the nations 
schools concluded the 85page survey report card on school 
reform the teachers speak 
on the bright side the survey found that 66 percent of teachers 
reported higher math achievement among their students and 64 
percent said reading and writing have improved 
seventysix percent said educational goals at their schools are 
more clearly defined than they were five years ago and 74 percent 
reported that more is expected of students fiftysix percent said 
the leadership role of their principals had improved 
but when teachers were asked if you were to give a grade to 
the education reform movement what would it be 50 percent gave 
it a c 13 percent a d and 6 percent a failing grade 
twentynine percent gave it a b and only 2 percent an a 
fortynine percent said teacher morale had worsened since 1983 
the year a national commission heralded the school reform movement 
with its report a nation at risk twentyeight percent 
reported no change and 23 percent said morale had improved 
ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation and author 
of the latest report said that teachers believe school reform has 
boosted student performance in the basics like reading 
but what the data show is that teachers feel largely bypassed 
in the process regulations have added more paperwork and the 
bureacracy has increased teaching conditions have gotten worse 
and in the process morale has gone down he said in an interview 
a majority of those surveyed reported no improvement or a 
worsening in key issues affecting working conditions such as study 
space for teachers daily teaching load class preparation time 
class size freedom from nonteaching duties teacher awards and 
money to support innovative ideas 
fiftynine percent said the salary picture was better than in 
1983 but only one in four felt that community respect for teachers 
had increased 
in his paid weekly column due to appear in sundays new york 
times american federation of teachers president albert shanker 
said the carnegie survey indicates teachers feel theyve been had 
on the promises of professionalism 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association the nations largest teacher union with 18 million 
members called the carnegie report right on target 
teachers tell me that in essence they do not have the 
authority or the resources to do what is expected of them 
futrell said in a statement 
while teachers nationwide gave mixed marks to school reform the 
survey found more upbeat attitudes in a few states where school 
reform has gotten the most political attention 
the standout in the survey was south carolina which has pumped 
hundreds of millions of dollars into improving its schools and 
where 46 percent of teachers surveyed graded school reform b 
and 6 percent gave reform an a 
the carnegie poll one of the largest ever of teacher attitudes 
was conducted by mail in november by the wirthlin group a national 
polling firm based in mclean va surveys were sent to 40000 
teachers in all 50 states and 13576 teachers completed them the 
survey had a sampling error of plus or minus 084 percent 
reports assessing school reform issued in the last few weeks 
have sharply differed on the role teachers have played 
a report in april by the rand corporation concluded that reform 
has improved salaries but has yet to elevate teaching to 
fullfledged professional status 
education secretary william j bennett followed on may 2 with a 
report chiding teacher unions for obstructing school reforms but 
last week a second rand report financed in part by bennetts own 
department absolved teachers of such blame 
bennett was out of the country until monday and unavailable to 
comment on the latest report

antiforeign and particularly 
antiamerican sentiment is growing here as the nation rides the 
crest of national pride brought about by the ouster of ferdinand 
marcos and the rise of president corazon aquino 
some filipino and foreign observers see the phenomenon as a 
healthy corrective to centurieslong subservience among a people 
dominated by spanish and american colonial power for about four 
centuries 
the filipinos should look to america purely as a market 
instead of engaging in sentimental nonsense such as partners in 
democracy historical ties and special relations wrote columnist 
hector villaneuva in the philippine daily globe 
but the mood may complicate the governments relations with the 
united states and other foreign countries as the philippines seeks 
economic and political support to rebuild after 20 years of ruinous 
administration under marcos 
antiforeign sentiment by no means approaches the level of 
xenophobia in such turbulent societies as iran or lebanon 
tens of thousands of filipinos live work and study abroad 
mixed marriages are widespread in manila and other urban areas and 
foreign goods many of them pilfered from us military exchanges 
are favored by those who can afford them 
but renewed filipino pride which emerged after the ouster of 
the marcos administration in february 1986 has been coupled with a 
deep resentment of foreign influence 
politicians and newspaper columnists routinely blame foreigners 
for the countrys economic problems prostitution in manila and 
for bankrolling the communist new peoples army 
legislation is pending in senate to ban advertising that uses 
foreign models or depicts an alien and unrealistic lifestyle 
many lawmakers have called for repudiating part of the countrys 
29 billion foreign debt 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
believes the ongoing talks between the united states and the 
philippines on the future of us military bases here has 
galvanized latent antiforeign sentiment 
a growing number of filipinos believe the six bases should be 
closed because they see them not as protection from soviet 
expansionism but as an odious remnant of american colonial rule 
last month the two governments began a review of the bases 
agreement which expires in 1991 filipino negotiators claim 
privately that the americans have been stonewalling in the 
talks 
american diplomats complain privately that their philippine 
counterparts are violating an agreement to keep the substance of 
the talks confidential 
several leading politicians and newspaper commentators have 
reacted negatively to reports that washington is putting together a 
multinational aid package for the philippines 
although terms and conditions of the package have not been 
announced critics have accused the united states of using the 
promised aid as leverage to allow its bases to remain here 
resentment of foreign particularly american influence has 
run deep in philippine society for generations in 1898 the united 
states helped filipino insurgents defeat spanish rulers then 
turned against them and took over the country after a twoyear 
guerrilla war 
in 1946 the united states granted independence to the 
philippines but forced the new government to accept a trade measure 
under which american firms had equal rights with filipino companies 
to exploit the nations resources 
us support for marcos including acquiesence of his 1972 
declaration of martial law revived antiamerican sentiment in the 
generation that now wields considerable influence over the nations 
government and mass media 
a new musical written by foreign secretary raul manglapus 
depicts a filipino view of historical relations with the united 
states 
columnist hilarion henares writing in the philippine daily 
inquirer suggested american diplomats attend the musical titled 
yankypanky to see the hypocrisy the deceit the betrayal 
the vicious greed the lovehate that characterize 
philippineamerican relations today 
some western diplomats believe the current freewheeling mood 
may complicate philippine dealings with important foreign 
countries from whom the government is seeking economic aid and 
political support 
last week manila newspapers bannered reports from unidentified 
military sources claiming a television crew from the british 
broadcasting corp paid communist rebels to stage an ambush in 
which 11 soldiers were killed 
some european diplomats said the charge which the bbc denied 
was embarassing because it surfaced two weeks before the planned 
visit of british foreign secretary geoffrey howe 
before thursdays arrival of spanish prime minister felipe 
gonzalez several manila newspapers featured reports of an alleged 
smear campaign against filipinos in spains media 
the reports were based on a letter to mrs aquinos children by 
a 67yearold british resident of spain who claimed newspapers 
there portray filipinos as simpletons and morons 
newspapers featured the claim despite offering no evidence of 
such reportage beyond the letter

the government of sierra leone has 
more than 9000 nonexistent employees on its payroll according to 
a census ordered by president joseph momoh 
momoh who received the report friday described the findings as 
sad news but he said they would help his government end the 
abuse of government funds through phony schemes to hire 
nonexistent civil servants known as die men 
the report said that of the 74699 government workers on the 
payroll only 65514 could be located a difference of 9185 
momoh ordered the census last november after declaring a state 
of economic emergency to prevent the collapse of the national 
currency the leone 
he said then that sierra leone with a population of 37 
million was spending 3 million a month on the salaries of 
government employees 
in west african countries the term die men refers to 
ghost workers whose paychecks are pocketed by corrupt 
employers

though the long complicated trial of 
political extremist lyndon larouche collapsed in the wake of 
complaints from disgruntled jurors legal experts have little fear 
that the episode portends similar problems in future jury cases 
larouches conspiracy trial in boston ended in a mistrial 
earlier this month when the presiding judge excused four jurors who 
complained after six months about its slow pace federal 
prosecutors hope to bring larouche to trial a second time in 
october 
jurorcaused mistrials get lots of attention but they are rare 
say experts who point to lawyer strategy not juror 
irresponsibility as the culprit in most such cases 
a jurys tribulations do not slow the wheels of justice in the 
vast majority of the 300000 jury trials held in state and federal 
courts each year the experts say 
statistics on mistrials caused by hung juries or other problems 
in the jury box are elusive said tom munsterman of the jury 
studies center of the national center for state courts but he said 
the numbers are sure to be negligible 
when a mistrial occurs its usually in a big trial thats 
going to last more than a few days munsterman said it often 
is a publicized case so the public gets the impression that 
mistrials occur more frequently than they do 
he added its when you get a case like the larouche case or a 
big narcoticsconspiracy case where problems can arise 
larouche six aides and five larouche organizations are charged 
with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into 
allegations that his 1984 presidential campaign reaped more than 2 
million through credit card and loan fraud 
the trial which had begun in december was proceeding very 
slowly testimony was all but halted in march for hearings on 
whether prosecutors deliberately withheld evidence from the defense 
when us district judge robert s keeton resumed testimony 
several jurors complained they had been told the trial would last 
only six months they said continuing through the summer would pose 
hardships keeton said he had no choice but to declare a mistrial 
he has set a second trial date for oct 3 but he first will 
hear arguments by defense lawyers that the mistrial was the 
governments fault and a new trial would represent impermissible 
double jeopardy 
joe s cecil of the federal judicial center said the mistrial in 
larouches case cannot be pinned to the jury litigation strategy 
disrupted the flow of the trial he said 
cecil was one of the authors of a survey report last year 
indicating that jurors are willing to tackle complex cases even if 
they result in lengthy trials 
former chief justice warren e burger warned in a 1979 speech 
that juries may not be able to cope with the increasingly complex 
legal issues and the mass of complicated information introduced at 
trials 
burger also voiced concern about the fairness of requiring 
citizens to serve on juries for extended periods of time 
but the federal judicial centers report said a majority of 
jurors from both long and short trials reported that their service 
interfered very little or not at all with their normal life 
and no significant difference emerged on this item between the 
responses of longtrial jurors and the responses of shorttrial 
jurors 
it added that more than fourfifths of jurors who had served in 
both long and short trials said they were willing to serve on the 
case if they had to do it over again 
even among those jurors who said their service had interfered 
a great deal with their normal life more than 60 percent said they 
would be willing to serve if they were called again for jury 
duty the report said 
while the perceptions of jurors in long and short trials may 
differ the differences are not great in magnitude and are offset 
somewhat by the seriousness with which all jurors approach their 
task the report concluded

the first of the air forces 
powerful new 150 million titan 4 space rockets was transported to 
a launch pad saturday under curious censorship 
the 20storytall rocket the largest unmanned booster in the 
us space stable is scheduled to make its maiden flight next 
october boosting a classified military reconnaissance satellite 
development of the titan 4 was accelerated following the 
explosion that destroyed space shuttle challenger in 1986 the 
grounding of the shuttle fleet left several critical national 
security payloads without a way to get into space and many of 
those will be hoisted by the new rocket 
the air force which held a media extravaganza here in january 
when the first rocket was delivered and its launch pad was 
dedicated originally said the news media would be escorted to the 
pad to cover saturdays rollout 
but air force secretary edward c aldrich who presided at the 
january festivity ruled the media out earlier this week with the 
pentagon explaining only that the launch sequence of military 
launch vehicles is not typically an item of public discussion 
but when the decision was made saturday to move the titan 4 air 
force public affairs officials alerted the news media at their 
homes by phone they also made arrangements to release photographs 
film and videotape of the move 
air force lt col ron rand director of public affairs at the 
eastern space and missile center replied absolutely none 
when asked if there were any security or safety reasons for barring 
the press saturday 
a titan 34d predecessor of the titan 4 is being readied on an 
adjacent pad for a secret military launching but rand said that 
had no bearing on the ruling 
the rocket was visible for miles during its 45minute move to 
the launch pad from an assembly building the closest point for the 
public to see it was about six miles away 
the launch pad debuts of previous space rockets have been open 
to news coverage here 
martin marietta is building 23 titan 4s for the air force at its 
plant near denver the pentagon is seeking millions in public funds 
to build an additional 27 boosters 
col lawrence gooch commander of the eastern space and missile 
center issued a statement saying the rollout of the titan 4 is 
another major step toward recovering our space launch capability 
from washington aldrich said the titan 4 program is one of 
the cornerstones of our national security stategy to rebuild 
assured access to space this booster represents the new workhorse 
of space for our nation 
for the next several months a team of specialists from the air 
force and martin marietta astronautics group will check the 
compatibility of the rocket with the new launch pad and prepare the 
vehicle for launch 
the air force plans to launch two titan 4 rockets a year from 
cape canaveral to boost military satellites for such assignments as 
reconnaissance communications and communications intercept other 
launches are scheduled from vandenberg air force base calif 
the titan 4 can boost 32000pound payloads into low earth orbit 
and 10000 pounds to stationary orbit 22300 miles high where most 
military satellites are based

have to be closed later on in order to finish painting it said new 
york state thruway authority spokesman arthur disabel 
traffic in both directions had been carried by the southern span 
of the 13 million bridge since december 
the april 5 1987 bridge collapse has been blamed on erosion 
around the footing of the bridge piers which shifted and caused 
the steel and concrete structure to tumble into the floodswollen 
creek 
the new bridge has pier foundations supported on steel piles 
driven into bedrock solid concrete piers and continuous steel 
girders the creek was widened under the bridge to reduce the water 
pressure on the bridge supports

the leader of the proiranian hezbollah 
group was quoted saturday as saying he would accept syrian troops 
in south beirut to end fighting between his fighters and the rival 
amal militia 
for the safety of residents we have accepted that the syrians 
deploy in the suburbs the barcelona daily la vanguardia quoted 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah hezbollahs spiritual leader as 
saying 
but there is still no decision on the form how and with 
what guarantees the syrian troops are to move into the area 
fadlallah told the newspapers correspondent in beirut 
more than 250 people have been killed and 850 wounded since may 
6 in south beirut fighting between hezbollah or party of god and 
the syriansupported amal both are shiite moslem militias 
most of 18 foreign hostages kidnapped by moslem extremists in 
lebanon are believed held in the slums nine of the hostages are 
us citizens 
asked whether he thought the presence of the foreign hostages 
created obstacles to ending violence fadlallah said i have no 
information to give an opinion on this matter 
fadlallah said his party and syrian troops have gotten along 
together before in the bekaa valley and that the syrian army aids 
hezbollah in its struggle against israel 
but i cant deny that in these moments there is a certain 
feeling of apprehension among our people over entry by syrian 
troops he said 
syria massed 7500 troops and 500 tanks on the edges of the 
embattled southern slums 
asked whether he thought syrian troops would move into the slums 
peacefully or by force fadlallah said there has been no decision 
by any party to the conflict to oppose their entry 
lebanon is a testing ground for all political powers in the 
world foreign influences are so great that no local force has any 
autonomy the peeple of this country are the guinea pigs the 
scapegoats of international politics

two miles north of saragosa the flat 
cotton fields flanking highway 17 begin to resemble a vast dusty 
junkyard crumpled tin roofs and sides of mobile homes along with 
the occasional battered stove litter the countryside 
they are leftovers from the tornado that ripped through saragosa 
a year ago sunday killing 30 people injuring 170 and leveling 
most of this unincorporated cottonfarming town of about 250 
residents 
amid those fields lies saragosas cemetery where 13 victims are 
buried like the memories of the tornados survivors the silk and 
plastic flowers that were put on the graves a year ago have barely 
faded 
its a completely different place all the way the tornado not 
only moved things it scratched things said maria paz candelas 
pronouncing scratched with a growl it scratched the dirt it 
come out like this she said making a vigorous scooping motion 
with her hand 
you know how a strong wind will pick up papers and trash 
well this one picked up rocks it pulled out mesquites we used to 
have a lot of trees mrs candelas said pointing out the kitchen 
window of her new house at the barren back yard once covered by 
stubbornrooted mesquite trees 
at about 830 pm on may 22 1987 the twister dipped from the 
clouds near the davis mountains six miles to the south and skipped 
across the fields before slamming into the community center during 
a preschool graduation ceremony the community center was destroyed 
along with 61 houses the catholic church the candelas familys 
convenience store and pieces of farm machinery 
for a lot of months when you came out here it looked like 
someone elses place another world said tomas martinez living 
in a trailer while he rebuilds his house when i came out here 
after the tornado there were no houses but there were all sorts 
of tv satellite trucks parked up and down the highway 
now new small boxlike houses built by red cross volunteers 
line saragosas streets the new community center boasts a basement 
shelter that can hold up to 300 people a warning siren on a 
30foot pole stands in the centers back yard a new church is 
halfway finished the diocese helped rebuild the candelas grocery 
the tornado drove away a few saragosa families but most elected 
to stay in the tightly knit mexicanamerican farming town despite 
the painful memories 
for starters the people that died we miss them said 
rosario lopez 26 a resident of nearby balmorhea who works as a 
clerk in the trailer that now serves as the towns post office 
every day when wed drive by wed seen them now theyre dead 
its unbelievable 
the rev daniel rojas saragosas parish priest was so taxed by 
the job of counseling survivors that he took a leave of absence and 
only a few people know where to reach him said corina brijalba 
48 who lost seven family members and depended heavily on rojas in 
her grief 
mrs brijalbas son lucas a 28yearold father of three died 
so did her mother amelia carrillo five other relatives two 
aunts and three cousins were killed when the concrete walls of 
the community center caved in mrs brijalba who suffered a 
punctured lung and a fractured skull lost sight in her right eye 
the vision of her husband pat was so impaired that he is legally 
blind 
after being in critical condition for three days mrs brijalba 
was notified of the deaths 
i asked how long did it last she recalled and they 
said five minutes i said five minutes my family was wiped 
out in five minutes 
mrs brijalba who recently was appointed the areas justice of 
the peace said she is impatient with the minority in town who have 
complained of alleged irregularities in the distribution of 
donations there also have been complaints that the replacement 
houses are too small and poorly built 
that irks me she said the people who didnt lose anyone 
seem to be the ones complaining about material things i would have 
taken a small bedroom if my son had been able to sleep in it 
there have been sleepless nights for many of saragosas 
children especially this spring with its brown dust devils 
snaking 200 feet skyward and its rainclouds marching over the davis 
mountains toward the town 
one recent windy rainy night sylvia mendozas 8yearold son 
and 9yearold daughter ran out of their room and jumped into bed 
between their parents 
whenever they see a lot of clouds and whenever they see a lot 
of wind they get scared mrs mendoza said adding that her 
seven children dont range about town as far as they used to and 
are more quick to go inside when it becomes windy and rainy 
mrs candelas said she misses the nightly soccer games children 
used to play near her house 
i used to get mad because they made so much noise she said 
they used to come out at night now theyre afraid theyre 
afraid if they come the tornado will get them here

a few weeks ago nine college students occupied 
the lobby of michael dukakis statehouse office and demanded an 
audience with the governor 
but dukakis was off in pennsylvania campaigning for president 
and the only reception the students got was from the capitol 
police who arrested them why isnt he here in the state when 
there are all these issues to address one of the protesters said 
its a question many on beacon hill have asked some have even 
suggested dukakis take an unpaid leave of absence and turn over the 
reins of massachusetts government to lt gov evelyn murphy while 
he concentrates on his democratic presidential race 
the threeterm governor who has said he will not resign unless 
and until he is sworn in as president has been on the campaign 
trail for more than a year balancing his statehouse duties with 
those of a white house aspirant 
fortunately i have been able to combine the two fairly well 
all things considered he said recently i think i can probably 
continue to do that certainly i am going to work hard at doing 
that 
but critics question how effectively hes handled the dual role 
they point to delays in enacting a 3 billion transportation bond 
in january and in dealing with recently discovered multimillion 
dollar revenue shortfalls in the fiscal 1988 and 1989 budgets 
there also have been charges of presidential politics entering 
into two other major initiatives his administration pushed in the 
legislature a firstinthenation universal health care bill 
which he signed in april and a pending bill to address 
skyrocketing auto insurance rates a hot topic in california and 
new jersey the two large states whose primaries close the season 
on june 7 
house republican leader steven pierce has criticized dukakis for 
management by neglect and other members of the minority gop 
have used similar language to characterize dukakis lack of 
onthespot leadership 
hes spread too thin the minority leader said ive said 
consistently that i have great respect for his energy and his 
stamina 
but even a person with a tremendous amount of those things 
cannot be a chief executive of a state with 70000 employees and a 
12 billion budget and a whole host of problems and also be a 
candidate for president of the united states they are both 
fulltime occupations 
robert behn director of duke universitys governors center 
said the question is more difficult than whether it is harder to do 
two jobs at once the hard question is can you do two things at 
the same time and do them both well he said 
a sitting governor hasnt won the presidency since franklin 
roosevelt as new yorks chief executive did it in 1932 but behn 
said that was a different era when less was popularly expected of a 
governor and less was required of a candidate to win the 
presidential nomination 
the middlesex news in framingham mass has been keeping a 
daily attendance record on the governor fridays tally showed that 
since jan 1 dukakis had been out of state for 121 partial or 
entire days including 31 weekend days 
when the governor is away his acting authority passes down a 
constitutional chain of command lt gov murphy has officially 
filled the bill most of the time although dukakis chief 
secretary hale champion carries out daytoday government duties 
however dukakis aides and democratic legislative leaders say 
that even if the governor isnt actually in the state he is still 
in charge 
the governor is running the government said senate ways and 
means chairman patricia mcgovern 
similarly house ways and means chairman richard voke said 
oh michael dukakis very definitely is the governor and in 
charge and i think certainly knows whats going on here on a 
daytoday basis 
dukakis sets the policy and makes the ultimate decisions for the 
administration champion said he can do that without being in 
boston eight hours a day through daily written briefings and phone 
conversations and group sessions with his cabinet and key 
legislators champion said 
i think this would be difficult to do if you had a governor 
who was relatively new at his job who didnt know the state 
hadnt been around a long time didnt know all the players 
champion said the governor can do it 
but pierce said the governor is obviously here some of the 
time and tries to create the appearance of being in charge no 
matter where he is but the sense is that different people 
dukakis aides and cabinet secretaries are in charge at different 
times and on different issues 
stephen hess senior fellow at brookings institution in 
washington said dukakis has shattered some longheld theories by 
coming as far as he has in the presidential race 
it was said until he showed otherwise that you really had to 
be an unemployed politician to run for president hess said 
that was the history of richard nixon in 1968 it was the history 
of jimmy carter in 1976 it was the history of ronald reagan in 
1980 and it was the history of fritz mondale in 1984 
so he has shown us that it is doable thats the important 
thing the conventional wisdom was otherwise hess said 
how well dukakis is able to fulfill his governors duties during 
this time will be more of a state issue than a national one hess 
said adding that massachusetts residents may be less harsh on the 
governor under the circumstances 
the upside of this for the commonwealth hess added is the 
prospect of possibly having your favorite son in the white 
house

changes in the way medicare reimburses for 
cataract surgery has spawned kickback arrangements between eye 
care professionals and led to shoddy patient treatment a 
republican congressional report said saturday 
the inspector generals office of the department of health and 
human services also has been investigating the referral 
arrangements and says legislation may be necessary to change the 
system 
the problem stems largely from a 7yearold law permitting 
optometrists to be paid by medicare for postsurgical cataract work 
for which medicare had previously only reimbursed ophthalmologists 
according to a report of the republican staff of the special senate 
committee on aging 
ophthalmologists are eye surgeons trained in medical school and 
residency programs optometrists who do not need medicalschool 
training but attend their own training programs examine eyes 
diagnose cataracts and other ailments and prescribe corrective 
lenses 
the new reimbursement policy which was clarified in medicare 
guidelines issued last year has made optometrists and 
ophthalmologists increasingly reliant on each other for business 
and has created the opportunity for highly questionable referral 
arrangements and kickbacks the report said 
some ophthalmologists who depend on optometrists for patient 
referrals are being held hostage by optometrists who refuse to 
refer patients unless they are guaranteed that the patient will be 
returned to them for postoperative care the report said 
it said the kickback arrangements have placed profits ahead 
of medical judgment sometimes encouraging inappropriate surgery or 
poor postoperative care by optometrists performing work for which 
they are not properly trained 
the report was based largely on some threedozen case studies in 
florida new york pennsylvania california utah and other states 
the case examples are to be presented along with the report at a 
hearing in philadelphia on monday with sen john heinz rpa as 
chairman 
also at the hearing bryan mitchell deputy inspector general of 
hhs is to present preliminary findings of an investigation into 
the questionable referral arrangements 
so far the probe has found that 28 percent of ophthalmologists 
interviewed permit optometrists to do cataract followup care 
according to an advance copy of mitchells statement 
those physicians perform a significantly greater number of 
cataract surgeries than their counterparts who do their own 
postoperative work mitchells prepared testimony said 
this year some 13 million americans are expected to have 
cataract surgery in which an artificial lens is placed in the eye 
the american academy of ophthalmology said in a statement to the 
committee that while it was tempting to make deals to surrender 
postoperative cataract care the overwhelming majority of our 
members insist on taking care of their patients from the 
preoperative workup through the postoperative recovery period 
harvey hanlen of the american optometric association told the 
panel there was a very legitimate and natural referral 
relationship between optometrists and ophthalmologists in 
cataract work 
he said his organization believes that referrals motivated 
solely on some quid pro quo economic agreement have no place in 
the system 
a bill signed into law last year prohibits payments made in 
return for steering medicare patients to a specific health 
professional for care however final regulation implementing the 
law have not yet been issued

in blue jeans tennis shoes and a tan 
fishing vest jimmy carter stepped carefully across the partly 
submerged rocks of turniptown creek then snapped several quick 
casts to put a tiny artificial lure in the swift current upstream 
the intensity of the dedicated fly fisherman creased his face 
even if the occasion was a photo opportunity to be repeated 
numerous times at carters cabin among the fern and white pine in 
this cool nook of the north georgia mountains 
at onehour intervals last week reporters and photographers 
were ushered past a secret service guard post to the roughhewn 
cabin 
there above a constant roar from a nearby falls the former 
leader of the western world talked about his fourth and latest 
book a narrative that avoids politics and history to offer a 
picture of the onetime georgia peanut farmer governor and 
president as an accomplished outdoorsman 
an outdoor journal adventures and reflections from bantam 
books at 1895 is going to book stores this week it depicts a 
young jimmy carter learning to hunt and fish in the swamps of south 
georgia under the stern tutelage of his father and absorbing the 
woods lore and occasionally earthy humor of the menfolk in his 
closeknit farming community 
the book is part travelogue part technical manual and part 
philosophical treatise 
in a quest for trophy rainbow trout along alaskas copper river 
carter marvels at the untamed beauty of the wilderness his 
administration helped protect 
he writes in detail of the life cycles the dedicated fly 
fisherman must study to present the proper lure to his quarry 
a strong conservation ethic also comes through in carters 
policy of releasing what he catches 
the outdoors he said in an interview holds many meanings for 
him 
one thing is its a resurrection or recollection of 
adventures or experiences i have known all my life as a farm boy 
so when i went in the navy or when i was in the governors mansion 
or in the white house i had a hunger for the forest the 
wilderness areas streams and fields that were the same or similar 
to the ones i knew as a child 
his love for the outdoors played a part in the camp david accord 
perhaps the most famous achievement of my life was brought 
about because former first lady rosalynn and i were walking 
through the quiet of a camp david trail i was deeply concerned 
about the mideast situation deteriorating and rosalynn said why 
dont we bring israeli prime minister menachem begin and 
egyptian president anwar sadat up here to camp david i think 
that the egyptians and the israelis in this kind of environment 
might forget about war and get to know each other better 
and of course it worked out that way i dont think that we 
ever could have healed the relationship between israel and egypt 
had it not been for the quietness and the contemplative environment 
of camp david 
the reagan administrations stewardship of the environment has 
been abominable carter said i think president reagans 
statement that trees cause pollution has been a kind of a basic 
philosophical characteristic of this administration 
carter makes no mention in the book of the most famous outdoor 
adventure of his presidential years the killer rabbit episode 
i guess i should have just to explain there was nothing to 
it carter said but i dont want to get into another 
altercation with the press about it that was a contrivance of the 
press 
the episode occurred in 1979 while fishing in a pond near his 
home in plains a rabbit also dubbed the banzai bunny swam 
toward carters canoe 
he told reporters at the time that he used a paddle to hit water 
to keep the rabbit away but first reports said the rabbit was 
making straight for carters canoe and that he beat it back with a 
paddle

the attorney for a woman convicted in the 
nations first deathbyproducttampering trial has asked a judge 
to throw out the verdict contending a jurors actions tainted the 
deliberations 
the juror who had been holding out for acquittal told the 
judge she got a telephone call telling her the defendant had 
flunked an fbi lie detector test information which had not been 
allowed in evidence she then changed her vote to guilty 
the same juror later revealed that she had won a settlement in a 
producttampering case a few months before 
stella nickell 44 of auburn was convicted may 9 of five 
producttampering counts including two stemming from the june 1986 
deaths of her husband bruce nickell and a woman she didnt know 
susan snow both died after swallowing cyanidelaced extrastrength 
excedrin capsules 
nickell could receive life imprisonment when she is sentenced 
june 17 
in a motion filed friday public defender thomas hillier ii 
asked us district judge william dwyer to declare a mistrial 
because of juror laurel hollidays actions 
hillier noted ms holliday was the only juror who reported 
receiving an anonymous phone that said mrs nickell had flunked the 
lie detector test 
ms holliday also failed to reveal the fact that she won a 500 
settlement in a product contamination suit about three months 
before the nickell trial began and had discussed the possibility of 
writing an article about her jury experiences hillier said 
ms holliday has said neither the telephone call nor her own 
lawsuit affected her fairness as a juror she has said she did not 
consider her case relevant to the cyanide trial and so did not 
mention it during jury selection 
she sued pepperidge farms inc in june 1987 alleging she bit 
into a cracker in july 1986 that contained an aspirin substitute 
pill pepperidge farms disputed the allegations but agreed to 
settle out of court

a songwriter has filed a libel suit seeking more 
than 11 million from daryl hall of the pop music duo hall and 
oates 
attorney mark guralnick said the suit filed friday in us 
district court stems from a dec 14 1986 music connection 
magazine interview in which hall allegedly defamed songwriter john 
madara best known for the 1950s hit at the hop 
guralnick said hall using an obscene phrase claimed madara had 
taken advantage of him early in his career causing him to become 
disillusioned with the music business 
guralnick said the suit is directed only at hall not the 
magazine it was filed in florida because the federal court here 
adheres to the twoyear statute of limitations of florida libel 
law he said suits against nationally circulated magazines may be 
filed in any state 
a call to halls attorney stephen hayes of new york was not 
answered friday evening and hayes had no answering service 
among the many hits by hall and oates are rich girl

merkle 43 became us attorney for floridas middle district 
covering 32 counties from fernandina beach to fort myers in 1982 
since then the former notre dame running back has obtained the 
indictments of three sitting florida representatives two judges 
three prosecutors and dozens of bankers attorneys and postal 
workers he once called gov bob martinez a liar during a trial 
when some of the states top powers called for his replacement 
in 1987 citizens in conservative central florida rallied to 
merkle a father of nine known for strong profamily positions and 
antidrug activism they spurred what justice department spokesman 
john russell called the first letterwriting campaign in memory in 
favor of a us attorney 
at the time the outspoken prosecutor had his own view of the 
effort to oust him im not sweating it im doing a great job 
if anyone looks at the performance of this office the last 4 
years its not just great its remarkable 
critics acknowledge his legal skills but question his methods 
he obviously has a great deal of talent however there is 
another side he can be rude abrasive and abusive said jose 
quinon one of lehders attorneys if he had been around during 
the constitutional convention a couple of hundred years ago he 
would have said the constitution is not needed 
merkle showed little fear of lehder identified with the violent 
medellin cocaine cartel during one hearing in february 1987 
shortly after lehder was arrested and brought to the united states 
from colombia lehder asked for a courtappointed attorney 
mr lehder responded merkle is that a rolex watch you 
are wearing on your wrist 
do you know that watch is worth approximately 6000 
at the time merkle was in political hot water for his dealings 
with martinez 
two days after martinez the former mayor of tampa was 
inaugurated as governor he was called as a defense witness in the 
mail fraud trial of a tampa insurance agent nelson italiano the 
trial ended in a conviction but the verdict was overturned on a 
technicality 
in closing arguments merkle told the jury that martinez lied on 
the stand when he denied receiving a bribe years earlier in 
connection with the awarding of a tampa cable television franchise 
the governor quickly contacted an aide to president reagan and 
asked that merkle be removed also tired of merkle was threeterm 
democratic sen lawton chiles who denied merkles claim the 
senator told him to ignore reports of hillsborough county 
corruption 
the two major newspapers in merkles tampa base the tampa 
tribune and the st petersburg times called for his dismissal so 
did 48 florida sheriffs 
but the clamor died down as merkle went after lehder jon peck 
spokesman for martinez said recently that the governor had not 
taken any further action seeking merkles removal 
now merkle said he is ready if it becomes possible to 
prosecute the drug indictment he secured against panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
it is also reported though merkle wont comment that he is 
seeking indictment of bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
whose nation was a stopping point for many of lehders cocaine 
shipments 
it wasnt so strange for merkle to quote one of soul singer 
james browns hits in reacting to the lehder verdict a popular 
speaker at civic functions he often brings his guitar and sings 
country songs with lyrics he has written 
mothers dont let your babies grow up to be lawyers is one 
of his adaptations

here is the text of the democrats response to 
president reagans weekly radio address given by senate majority 
leader robert c byrd 
this is senator robert c byrd of west virginia i want to talk 
to you about our national security 
americas great power is being sapped we are in danger of 
becoming a secondrate power why the reason is simple little by 
little we are handing over our economic future to foreign 
competition we are giving away the store we are surrendering our 
economic leadership 
this is wrong if we cannot afford a strong military how can we 
protect americas interests around the world if we do not have a 
strong economy how can we afford a strong military a strong us 
trade posture is fundamental to a strong military and economic 
future 
for years the administration has talked tough about trade but 
done little as a result we have an eroding economic base our 
foreign competition keeps chipping away 
congress has sent the president a good trade bill it has 
bipartisan support the president should sign the bill 
but the president does not like a small section of the trade 
bill the plantclosing provision that gives workers advance 
notice if they are about to lose their jobs the issue really is 
one of common decency and justice 
today congress and the american people are still waiting on the 
presidents answer as we began this weekend the trade bill still 
sat on the presidents desk unsigned american workers do not know 
whether they will get a fair shake mr president keep america 
strong sign the bill keep america number one 
all across america people are worried they see dark clouds on 
the economic horizon they are worried about their childrens 
future they know our current prosperity is fragile 
the president says the economy is booming the economic future 
is bright there is no need to worry if that is true why is the 
stock market so jumpy why are economists worried about a future 
recession or a sudden inflationary spiral the reason is simple 
the big boys are not willing to bet the farm on the rosy 
predictions of the administration 
it is time to rethink how we look at our economy and our 
national security if we surrender our economic leadership we 
surrender our economic future and our national security to foreign 
hands 
our real strength is measured in competence and stability not 
just in warheads and bombers smart students are just as important 
as smart weapons a welltrained work force is just as important as 
welltrained army in this era of competition 
not long ago the united states was the worlds largest creditor 
today we are the worlds largest debtor our treasury is forced to 
do the tin cup two step in one financial capital after another we 
have put the power of our own purse in foreign hands 
foreign investors are buying everything from our bonds to our 
businesses to our real estate how much longer will we be in 
control of our own house the question of debt has become a 
question of national standing national security and national pride 
in one industry after another we are losing our position of 
leadership good jobs are at stake so is our security ten years 
ago we led the world in the memory chips that are the building 
blocks of computers and the weapons of war today we are 
struggling just to keep up with the japanese 
the machine tool industry is a critical defense industry but 
foreign machine tools are flooding the american market this is 
alarming because without machine tools we cannot build the ships 
submarines tanks guns and missiles needed to protect the united 
states and our interest abroad this is dangerous 
but something can be done we can remain strong we can remain 
number one but seven and a half years of borrow and debt a 
policy of national neglect have led to an increasing dependency 
on foreign capital it is time of change course the trade bill on 
the presidents desk is one step in the right direction 
the president has the trade bill on his desk if he signs it he 
makes america stronger if he vetoes it he weakens america at 
stake is nothing less than our economic future and security mr 
president the future is in your hands sign the trade bill

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address as delivered saturday from the white house 
my fellow americans you may have heard me say before that one 
of the things i like most about my job as president is visiting and 
talking with our young men and women in uniform 
ive met them all over the world at our army outposts along the 
demilitarized zone in south korea on board the uss constellation 
in the hangars of tempelhof air base in west berlin at parris 
island in south carolina and at the coast guard academy a few days 
ago 
and everywhere ive seen that their commanders are right 
theyre the best weve ever had i mention this because today is 
armed forces day yes this is the day for all of us to salute the 
soldiers sailors marines and aviators who stand sentry on the 
frontiers of freedom all over the world 
we say thanks to the patriots who whether under the midnight 
star or the noonday sun are always alert so that americas peace 
and liberty will always be safe seven years ago when we came to 
washington we found that our armed forces had been badly neglected 
we found airplanes that could not fly and ships that could not 
sail for lack of trained people and spare parts the military 
couldnt recruit enough good people or hold on to those they had 
today thats changed the men and women in the services are well 
trained and well equipped almost all new recruits have a high 
school diploma never before in peacetime have we had a military 
that is as well prepared 
just last month the world saw that those who serve america on 
freedoms front what they can do when the chips are down im 
speaking of the story of the uss samuel d roberts a guided 
missile frigate and part of our task force to help protect passage 
through international waters in the persian gulf 
the roberts was on patrol when it hit a submerged mine the mine 
blew a huge hole in the ships hull set a fireball shooting up the 
exhaust stack and 150 feet in the air and almost tore the roberts 
in half luckily no one was killed some might have said that 
she was doomed head for the life rafts 
well thats not what the men of the roberts said they were 
determined to show what they could do acting fast they held the 
roberts together with bolts and wire took care of their injured 
escaped the mine field and with the help of other navy ships got 
safely to harbor 
the captain summed up the spirit and determination of the entire 
crew when he closed his report saying of the roberts we saved 
her well fix her and well fight again and he signed off with 
their motto no higher honor 
thats the spirit skill and dedication that has been rebuilt 
in all our armed services today no higher honor could be the 
motto of every american in uniform 
yesterday to show the nations gratitude again i signed into 
law three bills expanding veterans benefits in education job 
training health care and other areas the men and women on duty 
today should know that well still be behind them when their 
service is done 
they also deserve to know that like them were all doing our 
part to keep the peace this week i was pleased that the senate 
began floor debate on the intermediaterange nuclear forces or 
inf treaty this treaty has had a thorough and useful examination 
in committee 
now the senate can join with me and show both our allies and 
adversaries that it too wants to help build a brighter peace and 
better world i hope the senate will provide its consent to 
ratification of the inf treaty in time to bring it into force 
during my meetings with the general secretary in moscow 
on this armed forces day lets also remember the important role 
the armed services have been playing in supporting law enforcement 
agencies in the fight against drugs i asked the secretary of 
defense this week to find even more ways to use military resources 
against drug smugglers i also called for a joint task force the 
executive branch and congress to draw up a unified plan to fight 
drugs 
i hope the leaders of congress agree with me that the campaign 
against illegal drugs must not be hostage to headlineseeking and 
partisan politics 
this week we had another sign of americas strength its 
economic strength which undergirds all of our national security 
efforts trade figures came out for march america exported in 
march more than ever before 
against this background of good news on trade im going to veto 
the illadvised trade bill congress has sent me once my veto is 
sustained well work hard to get a responsible trade bill one 
that will strengthen not weaken our economy 
one last thought for armed forces day and every day if you see 
someone in uniform would you go up shake their hand and thank 
them 
until next week thanks for listening god bless you

the government saturday freed seven 
female members of the former royal family imprisoned since a 1974 
marxist revolution ended the 44year rule of emperor haile selassie 
the women were greeted by relatives in a tearful reunion in the 
courtyard of the police headquarters said an east bloc journalist 
who witnessed the release 
the governmentowned ethiopia news agency announced the release 
in a short statement 
the state council of the peoples democratic republic of 
ethiopia today granted amnesty to seven members of the former royal 
family of the defunct feudal regime the agency said 
freed saturday were selassies 79yearold daughter 
tenagnework haileselassie her four daughters aida hirut seble 
and sofia her daughterinlaw sara gizaw and zuriashwork 
gebereegziabher identified only as a relative of the princess 
no ages were available on the other royals 
the release of the seven princesses leaves three grandsons of 
haile selassie still behind bars all are sons of tenagnework 
haileselassie they are believed to range in age from 27 to 40 
years 
in addition to his daughter haile selassie claimed three other 
children all sons two of the sons have been dead for more than 20 
years 
the crown prince merid azmatch asfawossen haile selassie 71 
lives in london he had been in london for nearly two years 
undergoing treatment for diabetes when his fathers reign ended 
they princesses spent nearly 14 years of detention in the 
womens section of the central prison in addis ababa 
over the years a number of ethiopians living in the west have 
passed themselves off as the crown prince or a princess of the 
ethiopian royal family 
the government kept the jailed royals under tight wraps and it 
was only in 1986 that they were permitted outside their cells to 
receive regular medical and dental treatment in hospitals in addis 
ababa before then physicians were taken to the prison to treat 
the royals 
the 10 relatives were never brought to trial amnesty 
international the londonbased human rights group listed them 
among its prisoners of conscience in ethiopia and the government 
had ignored appeals for their release 
in britain conservative members of parliament had led an 
international campaign to win the royals freedom 
this has come about because of the buildup of international 
pressure in which we played our part said david harris one of 
the leaders in the campaign 
it was an act of great inhumanity that they had been locked up 
without trial and without charge he said this is wonderful 
news and brings to an end one of the worst cases of imprisonment 
without trial in modern history 
harris said the princess were held under appalling 
conditions he said princess tenagnework suffers from stomach 
ulcers and chronic rheumatism one of her daughters is partially 
paralyzed another has skin cancer and a third has hepatitis 
press association britains domestic news agency reported 
that if the princesses wanted to come to britain no bar will be 
placed in their way the agency did not attribute those comments 
to any government official 
haile selassie who received worldwide attention in the 1930s 
when italy occupied his country ruled ethiopia for 44 years as 
head of one of the worlds last feudal states he was deposed on 
sept 12 1974 by a military clique that established a marxist 
government 
the emperor who had made ethiopia the united states strongest 
ally in africa was last seen alive climbing into the back seat of 
a volkswagen beetle parked outside his main palace in the center of 
addis ababa 
he died under obscure circumstances 11 months later while in 
detention and the government buried his body in a secret location 
the military leaders who dethroned haile selassie led by col 
mengistu haile mariam swung ethiopia into the soviet unions camp 
and made the east africa country moscows closest ally in africa

cambodias provietnamese government 
has ended an unprecedented national conference in which top leaders 
urged that militias be strengthened to prevent guerrilla 
infiltration and living conditions improved 
officials of 500 model communes nationwide discussed local 
defenses in the may 1619 conference in phnom penh also attended 
by top party and state leaders including president heng samrin and 
prime minister hun sen the official spk news agency said in a 
report seen saturday 
an earlier official radio broadcast said hun sen exhorted the 
commune leaders to increase cooperation between military and police 
forces strengthen the propaganda campaign and grant clemency to 
those who abandon the guerrilla movement 
the local militia in particular must be strengthened he said 
hun sen and heng samrin also called for efforts to improve 
villagers livelihoods by increasing rice production in the coming 
rainy season 
the phnom penh government was installed by vietnam after it 
invaded the country in late 1978 and is backed by thousands of 
vietnamese troops in fighting three main guerrilla groups 
the conference was convened in response to increased attacks and 
undercover operations mounted by the largest guerrilla group the 
khmer rouge 
vietnamese forces wiped out all guerrilla bases along the 
thaicambodian border in 198485 but since then the rebels have 
reestablished their positions 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 until the vietnamese 
invasion and were responsible for the deaths of millions during 
their radical communist regime 
in a preview of the conference phnom penhs official communist 
party paper pracheachon the people said the partys ruling 
politburo considers the localities as a matter of life and death 
to the revolution as the core battlefield and the work of 
building and consolidating the localities villages communes 
units and army bases as the key task in 1988 
khmer rouge guerrillas the paper said were spreading 
propaganda in the villages planting secret agents and 
preparing for 1990 when vietnam has said it will withdraw the last 
of its troops from cambodia 
it said while phnom penh was able to counter pyschological 
warfare in the interior of the country the guerrillas were 
infiltrating a number of remote villages and communes along the 
cambodianthai border and intimidating people there with 
impunity 
in these areas it said living conditions are primitive 
security forces dont support the people in attacking the 
guerrillas and some villagers are even helping the guerrillas

the death of three mountain climbers in an 
avalanche on mount rainier will probably attract even more 
thrillseekers to a peak that looks lovely but sometimes acts like a 
devil that shows pity on noone national park officials say 
news like this tends to bring more people to the mountain 
said bill jensen the parks chief ranger its a very dangerous 
hazardous route and thats what attracts people the thrill of 
danger 
the bodies of craig loyal adkison 37 of kirkland david 
kellokoski 30 of tahoeparadise calif and greg remmick 32 of 
citrus heights calif were recovered by helicopter friday from 
the 14410foot mountain 
they had been scheduled to finish their climb of the treacherous 
liberty ridge route up the mountains north face on may 14 the 
search began for the three tuesday and their bodies were spotted 
from the air thursday 
the deaths brought to 54 the number of climbers who have died on 
the dormant volcano since 1898 and another 24 have perished on 
lesser peaks and slopes nearby said cy hentges a spokesman for 
mount rainier national park 
officials at mount rainier national park stressed the mountains 
perilous unpredictable nature and worried that the latest deaths 
would attract thrillseeking climbers to it 
lets realize that the american everest team trained on it 
hentges said that should tell you something its on a miniature 
scale but it provides anything and everything that everest does 
except its not that high 
you can walk up sometimes roped with proper equipment but in 
shorts but all it takes is one storm to come in and this has 
happened many times to kill people within half an hour of a road 
system it has killed children on what seems like a gentle slope 
its something that can become very angry 
it looks so lovely and so beautiful and yet it can be a devil 
that shows pity on no one 
hentges said bad weather and unstable fresh snow probably caused 
the three to fall 2000 feet to their deaths in an avalanche their 
bodies were recovered from an avalanche chute at the 10000foot 
level by a helicopter equipped with a grappling hook that snagged 
the rope connecting them and carried them to a safer spot 
about 8000 people attempt mount rainier each year most of them 
up the less steep and glaciated south side and about half make it 
to brave the liberty ridge route climbers must be very strong 
and wellprepared for bad weather hentges said 
everest veteran lou whittaker who has run the only guide 
service on the peak for decades and that on the southerly route 
made six attempts on liberty ridge before making it to the summit 
hentges said 
if weathers coming in you have to say its not safe and turn 
around he said 
there is a point of no return hentges added when you 
must continue to the top and if you hit bad weather you can get 
in real trouble

three out of five new england women had jobs or 
were seeking work last year as the influx of females into the 
regions labor force continues to outpace men by a threetoone 
margin a us bureau of labor statistics report says 
yet almost a third of working women in new england hold 
traditional female occupations such as clerical jobs or 
teaching while womens median earnings were only 70 percent of 
their male counterparts last year according to the report being 
released sunday 
however the growing number of women and their increased 
commitment to the labor force have consistently narrowed the 
earnings gap between men and women said anthony j ferrara 
regional commission of the bureaus boston office 
womens recordhigh 60 percent participation in the regions 
labor force last year rose from 518 percent in 1977 compared with 
56 percent nationwide last year and 484 percent in 1977 
for the period between 1982 and 1987 353000 women and 102000 
men joined the labor force in the sixstate new england region 
according to the report 
although increases were noted in all womens age categories the 
greatest gains since 1982 were registered among 25 to 
44yearolds the highest percentage in the regions labor force 
last year was women 2024 years old at 786 percent 
only divorced widowed or separated women and black or hispanic 
women experienced a slight decrease in the labor force since 1982 
in general new england womens employment figures were higher 
than the nationwide statistics new england men and women however 
had slightly lower average work hours in 1987 than the national 
average and womens average work week in new england last year was 
343 hours compared to 419 hours for men 
ferrara attributed the shorter work hours to womens prominence 
in the retail and service industries where parttime work is 
common 
new england woman have participated more fully in the labor 
market and have benefited from an extended period of economic 
growth said the report 
the data in the report indicates mothers across the country are

the gendergap problem that plagued president 
reagan could become an even greater liability for george bush 
whose standing among women is deteriorating as the fall campaign 
approaches 
the vice president who used his close identification with 
reagan to clinch the republican presidential nomination appears to 
have inherited reagans relative weakness among women voters 
without picking up the presidents strength among democratic 
bluecollar and ethnic voters polling data suggests 
the prospect that bush may have a problem winning support among 
women in november has campaign aides worried and has sent political 
analysts searching for explanations 
clearly i think that if youre 16 or 18 points behind its 
not an enviable situation to be in said bush spokesman peter 
teeley obviously theres a gender gap there and its probably 
related to certain issues that women particularly single women 
are interested in 
i think once bush begins to talk about various issues there 
will be some benefit to him and that gap will close teeley 
said 
republican consultants interviewed by the associated press were 
nearly unanimous in saying that bush needs to do something quickly 
and that the gendergap problem not only affects him but all gop 
candidates this year 
the current gender gap is not just george bushs problem it 
is an institutional problem for all republican candidates said 
roger stone a republican consultant 
bush has got to recognize that women are a target group for 
him and hes got to lay out his own views of parental leave child 
care and stress his own theme that his experience in foreign 
policy is best to lead us to peace stone said 
if he does those things i think he will close the gap by 
election day just as reagan closed the gap with carter 
a cbsnew york times poll last week put bush 10 points behind 
michael dukakis with the massachsetts governor at 49 percent and 
the vice president at 39 percent in a fall matchup it also showed 
that while the two candidates ran about evenly among men dukakis 
held a 5435 percent lead among women 
recent internal polls for bush and the republican party show a 
similarly wide deficit in the vicinity of 20 points in support 
among women voters according to gop sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
these polls also disclose that women are far less optimistic 
about the economy than men suggesting that the current 65month 
economic recovery usually viewed as a major campaign asset for 
bush may be of little help in persuading many women voters to 
vote republican 
and while pollsters caution that polls 5 months before an 
election are not to be taken too seriously the recent results 
suggest that bushs current gender gap problem is about twice as 
deep as it was in the reaganbush 1984 landslide reelection 
victory that ticket won a narrow majority of womens votes 
an election day poll in 1984 by nbc showed that men backed 
reagan and bush by 64to36 while women backed the ticket by 5545 
in the 1980 election an apnbc poll showed that men backed 
reaganbush by 5636 percent women by 4745 percent 
why should bush score more poorly than reagan among women 
reagan has far more charm than bush ever will have i think 
that helps in politics said molly yard president of the liberal 
national organization for women 
but she said the reagan administration has had a negative image 
among many women all along bush like reagan is antiera 
antireproductive rights those are kind of bottom line issues for 
an awful lot of women 
republican pollster linda divall said bush did not have a 
gender gap when he ran for president in 1980 he has one now 
because hes part of the reagan team it is a problem in that we 
need to recognize it exists and we need to determine the kind of 
issues that can be targeted to certain types of women to minimize 
the gap 
it provides a good case for naming a woman as vice 
president she added some bush advisers have suggested that a 
moderate woman candidate such as kansas sen nancy kassebaum 
might be a good choice 
irene natividad leader of the national womens political 
caucus said that bushs poor polling among women doesnt 
surprise me this vice president has flipflopped on womens issues 
as he changed from a fairly moderate republican to a very 
conservative one 
the other reason there is a serious gender gap is that he 
hasnt shown a sensitivity to the concerns of the modern women 
through statements and gestures hes been showing an attitude 
toward women thats frozen in the 50s she said 
aides note that despite the apparent gender gap bush has 
stressed issues that are important to many women such as day care 
but bush spokesman teeley conceded one or two trips to day 
care centers is not going to solve it it has to be done on a more 
consistent basis 
rep jim leach riowa a moderate republican who is a bush 
supporter said the gender issue is also a problem for the 
democrats but in the reverse why do they have a problem with 
males shouldnt that issue be treated as seriously as the 
republican problem with females 
however he said bush has got to be far more in tune with 
younger peoples concerns and far more compassionate than reagan on 
issues like day care if he expects to narrow the gender gap

curriculum as the most important element in schools

sen joseph r biden jr ddel plagued with 
health problems since february was released from the hospital 
saturday about three weeks after he underwent surgery to repair an 
artery near his brain 
i am happier than you can possibly believe to be out of the 
hospital biden said at a news conference outside walter reed 
army medical center i am in good shape and anxious to go back to 
work 
he also said that though his health problem didnt come to light 
until after he dropped out of the race for the democratic 
presidential nomination ending his campaign may have saved his 
life 
i think getting out of the race was quite frankly a 
godsend he said if he had stayed in the race the percentages 
are i might not have made it down here he said 
the 45yearold senator withdrew from the race after 
acknowledging he plagiarized a law school exam and exaggerated his 
achievements 
biden appearing thin but relaxed and in good humor said he 
planned to recuperate at his home in wilmington del before 
resuming his duties in the senate where he is chairman of the 
senate judiciary committee and a member of the foreign relations 
committee he left the hospital in a car driven by his wife jill 
and accompanied by his 6yearold daughter ashley and his mother 
jean 
there is no reason why i cannot resume all of my senate duties 
with the same vigor that i have before biden said noting that 
he routinely worked 15to18hour days in the past 
i feel like i could go back now but they doctors wont let 
me until i build up my strength biden said he said he hoped 
to resume his schedule in the senate between now and september 
but its kind of hard to tell 
biden said he had generally followed developments in the 
judiciary foreign relations committees although he had not kept up 
with the daytoday events 
to gain strength biden said he follows a regimen that includes 
lifting weights and riding a stationary bicycle he plans to return 
to the hospital in about a month for a checkup 
peter esker a spokesman at walter reed said a team of 
neurological surgeons headed by dr eugene george is extremely 
pleased with bidens progress his overall health is 
excellent he said 
doctors have found no additional aneurysm or other problems 
that would interfere with his complete recovery 
biden who dropped out of the democratic presidential race last 
september first underwent surgery on feb 12 to repair an aneurysm 
in an artery supplying blood to the left side of his brain 
at that time doctors discovered but were unable to fix a 
second smaller aneurysm in an artery on the right side of the 
brain doctors repaired the second aneurysm during a 4 12 hour 
operation on may 3 
an aneurysm is a weakened area in an artery the pressure of 
blood causes the area to balloon forming a blisterlike flaw on 
the side of the artery 
to correct the problem doctors perform microscopic surgery 
inserting a metal clip into the head that locks at the base of the 
flaw the clip remains in the head 
further complicating bidens recovery was a blood clot that 
doctors found in his lung on march 13 the clot was absorbed into 
the body without any damage but to prevent further problems 
doctors inserted a tiny filter into a major vein to prevent other 
clots from reaching the lungs 
biden said he never feared for his life despite the severity of 
the operations particularly the first one in which he said doctors 
told him his changes of surviving were a little better than 
even 
the odds improved dramatically for operation on the second 
aneurysm with only about a 1 percent change of dying he said 
biden said he planned to seek reelection to the senate in 1990 
asked whether he thought attorney general edwin meese iii should 
resign biden said he was one of the few people who argued 
strenuously against meeses appointment from the start i stand 
by my remarks he said 
meese has been criticized for a number of actions including his 
association with e bob wallach a lawyer indicted in the wedtech 
case

of talking 
the boys principal betty meares said his father came to 
school that same day to pick up omars report card because he 
apparently had failed to take it home the may report card is only 
a progress report for parents and does not determine whether a 
student is passed or failed

nathan sharansky the human rights activist 
who was freed from the soviet union in february 1986 after nearly a 
decade in captivity says prison doctors once pried his mouth open 
with a metal device to forcefeed him during a hunger strike 
the forcefeeding was intended to feed my body the torture to 
save my soul sharansky writes in his new book fear no evil 
excerpts were published in the may 21 edition of us news amp world 
report 
sharansky 40 spent from 1977 until 1986 in soviet prisons 
charged with spying and other offenses which he denied he was 
allowed to emigrate to israel in 1986 after his case attracted 
international attention 
in his book sharansky recalls how he embarked on a hunger 
strike in 1982 because soviet authorities refused to allow him to 
see his family or correspond with them 
before they resorted to metal pincers authorities tried a 
number of methods to feed sharansky whose weight dropped from 143 
pounds to 77 pounds finally they arrived with more reliable 
methods he said 
the handcuffs were clicked on and the guards held me by the 
feet head and shoulders he said somebody pressed pincers on 
my cheeks and pushed down very painfully while rotating the 
pincers 
as soon as i opened my mouth a metal object was inserted 
between my teeth the turning of the screw to which two plates 
were attached began to separate the plates which make my mouth 
open wider and wider the complicated task of introducing a tube 
into my mouth had been completed 
the forcefeeding continued for three days until prison 
officials relented and allowed sharansky to correspond with his 
mother his hunger strike lasted 110 days 
sharanskys book also relates other episodes from his 
imprisonment as well as his flight to freedom in germany

festival describes parkers dependence on drugs and alcohol 
it is based largely on a book by parkers widow chan life in 
eflat many of the films sequences are shown from her point of 
view 
she helped me a great deal said diane venora who plays 
chan in the film she explained how life with him degenerated 
parker got the nickname yardbird later shortened to 
bird at the reno club in kansas city 
too young to gain entry he would hang around outside trying to 
hear the music of count basie basies musicians compared him to a 
chicken always hanging around in the yard the name stuck 
we didnt cover much of his early life though said 
eastwood because thats another story 
forest whitaker who appeared in oliver stones platoon and 
the color of money by martin scorsese plays the adult parker 
the composer and musical director of bird lennie niehaus 
taught whitaker to play the saxophone

police sweeps of ganginfested neighborhoods 
seem to have lowered dramatically the number of driveby 
shootings this spring even though most of those arrested have 
quickly been released officials say 
authorities concede that many of the 1456 people nabbed during 
last months sweeps were back in their neighborhoods within days 
but they insist there are indications the streets are being retaken 
by officers 
while the news media focus on almost nightly gang violence 
often involving innocent victims deputy chief robert rathburn 
notes the drop in driveby shootings since his task force 
roundups began 
we have been averaging 26 drivebys a month in 77th division 
a south central gang hotbed and we only had seven in april and 
two so far this month rathburn said last week 
his task force was applauded by vice president george bush who 
observed youre up against the rotten little cowards who shoot 
innocent people 
rathburn the citys gang czar defended last months highly 
publicized sweeps which involved 1000 officers 
i think there has been a reduction in gang violence since the 
sweeps began rathburn said the task force is having an 
effect im optimistic that things are going in the right 
direction 
civil libertarians have raised questions 
attorney r samuel paz chairman of the hispanic advisory 
council to the police commission and a local american civil 
liberties union chapter board member said the sweeps remind him of 
the zoot suit roundups of the 1940s when hispanics were 
singled out for arrest primarily because of their clothing 
people are willing to say let them stop all the kids 
thats my real concern he said that could be my kid 
raymond johnson branch president of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people has urged police to keep 
civil liberties in mind and not take in people based on hunches or 
for minor offenses that would normally go unpunished 
make good arrests dont use excessive force he said at a 
news conference 
police couldnt determine how many were of the 1456 arrested in 
the huge gang sweeps of april 8 and 9 were still in jail because 
we dont have a system that could track that down said capt 
dennis conte spokesmen for the district attorney and city attorney 
also said those arrests werent flagged and theres no easy way 
to trace the cases 
but the police department did study a sampling of 276 of the 
1456 arrests and found that 79 were felony arrests and the rest 
were for trafficrelated misdemeanors and lesser crimes conte said 
of the 79 felony arrests prosecutors ultimately brought felony 
charges in 24 cases including charges such as murder assault 
rape and armed robbery said conte sixteen others in that group of 
79 eventually were charged with misdemeanors he said 
seventyone percent of the 197 arrested for misdemeanors 
meanwhile were eventually charged with misdemeanor crimes conte 
said adding that many of those were released on the monday 
following their weekend arrest 
conte explained how most of the arrested street thugs are 
quickly back on the streets 
it is the policy of the city attorneys office that if they 
stay in jail for the weekend and it comes to arraignment on monday 
and the penalty is three days they wont file and they are 
released on time served conte said 
officers estimated initially that about half those arrested in 
the sweep were affiliated with gangs 
rathburn said eradication of street thugs may take years the 
problem didnt develop overnight and its not going to be solved 
overnight he said 
the big sweeps serve a number a purposes it shows the gangs 
we are committed to the battle and more importantly it shows the 
community we are there too that its not just a public relations 
show rathburn said 
taking aim at known gang leaders is another police tactic 
day in and day out we are being more selective in removing 
the hard core gang leadership from the streets we are going to see 
the gangs collapse from lack of leadership rathburn said 
asked if the streets have become safer since the police sweeps 
rathburn said its hard to gauge the important thing in the 
long term is affecting the perception of residents 
people live in fear in south central los angeles i want to 
change that fear transfer it from the resident to the criminal

a 14yearold boy afflicted with a rare 
disease that makes his arteries resemble those of a 70yearold is 
recovering well from quadruple heart bypass surgery doctors said 
gilbert bowers underwent the operation at memorial hospital here 
may 13 after suffering a massive heart attack while playing 
basketball doctors who disclosed details of the case friday say 
that they know of no patient younger to have had that type of 
operation 
its ok really said gilbert i didnt know i was the 
youngest i never thought about it doctors say he should 
eventually be able to resume playing basketball he said 
in bypass surgery blood vessels from elsewhere in the body are 
grafted around the blood vessels leading to the heart to get around 
blockages doctors said the boy would have died without the 
operation 
to the best of our knowledge we have searched around and 
not found anyone of this age to have this kind of surgery said 
dr silvio sperber a cardiologist at memorial this is a very 
rare case 
the 7hour operation however was only a stopgap measure to 
cure a rare disease that gilbert was born with which robs his body 
of its ability to rid itself of cholesterol within a couple of 
years gilbert will need a liver transplant doctors said 
the genetic disease called hypercholesterolemia familial is 
found in about one in a million people doctors said 
the cholesterol has clogged gilberts arteries to the point 
where they could easily be mistaken for those of a 70yearold man 
doctors said he had been under treatment for the problem 
previously but doctors didnt realize the extent of it 
all he can do is accumulate cholesterol sperber said the 
heart itself is that of a 14yearold its the fuel lines that run 
into the heart that are clogged

a puerto rican separatist accused of 
masterminding the 7 million robbery of a wells fargo depot has 
been released on 1 million bail after being held for 32 months in 
pretrial detention 
filiberto ojeda rios alleged to have helped plan the september 
1983 robbery in order to finance a violent separatist movement in 
puerto rico was allowed to leave prison friday after a federal 
judge certified that title to three pieces of real estate on the 
island was being transferred to the government securing his bail 
i have read it i understand it i agree to it voluntarily 
ojeda said of the terms of his release a packed gallery burst into 
applause as he was pronounced free 
its good to breathe fresh air he said moments later 
outside the courthouse holding a fullsized puerto rican flag in 
front of him while family and friends waved smaller plastic 
versions of the flag behind him i think its a victory of the 
people 
while awaiting trial with 15 other defendants ojeda must wear 
an electronic ankle bracelet that authorities will use to monitor 
his movements he will live in a hartford apartment and wont be 
able to leave the city 
us district judge t emmet clarie set ojedas trial date for 
sept 6 pretrial hearings began in january 1987 asked outside 
the courthouse if he planned to appear for the trial ojeda said 
i do 
but he said i do not recognize the jurisdiction of the court 
and principles will be my line of guidance for future conduct 
principles honor and particularly the honor of my people and my 
country are the elements that will serve as guidance as to whatever 
action i take in the future 
authorities allege that the 55yearold ojeda is a cuban agent 
who helped mastermind the robbery of the wells fargo depot in west 
hartford to finance activities of los macheteros a violent group 
seeking puerto rican independence 
other wells fargo defendants are free on bonds ranging as high 
as 15 million clarie had previously denied bond for ojeda five 
times prosecutors contend ojeda is a risk to flee the country 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york last week 
ordered that bond be set and that ojeda be released further 
detention would violate his constitutional rights

communist party authorities on saturday fired the 
leaders of the southern republics of armenia and azerbaijan in an 
apparent effort to prevent more of the ethnic turmoil that has 
killed at least 32 people this year 
the official tass news agency said karen demirchyan first 
secretary of armenias communist party was ousted during a meeting 
of his republics central committee in the capital city of yerevan 
azerbaijani party first secretary kyamran bagirov was fired 
during a meeting in baku the azerbaijani capital tass said 
both meetings were attended by politburo officials in charge of 
party organization ideology and propaganda a sign of moscows 
concern about events in the two southern republics and its direct 
involvement in the changes 
the kremlins no 2 man yegor k ligachev addressed the baku 
meeting politburo member alexander n yakovlev party propaganda 
chief and a key adviser to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
spoke to the meeting in yerevan tass gave no details about what 
either man said 
tass said demirchyan and bagirov were retired for health 
reasons but their replacement likely reflected dissatisfaction in 
moscow with their failure to contain the dispute over control of 
the mountainous nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan 
armenians are demanding that the armeniandominated region be 
annexed to their republic 
after a period of quiet following riots in the azerbaijani city 
of sumgait in which at least 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis were 
killed mass meetings were reported again last week by armenian 
activists and the official baku radio 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said thursday that there was a 
constant danger of an explosion in nagornokarabakh and that 
the region was surrounded by soldiers 
bagirov 55 was replaced in the job he had held since 1982 by 
58yearold abdul rahman vezirov the soviet ambassador to pakistan 
the 56yearold demirchyan who had been communist party leader 
since november 1974 was replaced by 49yearold suren arutyunyan 
armenias first deputy prime minister 
dissident journalist sergei grigoryants who is half armenian 
and has followed events there closely said armenians despised and 
distrusted demirchyan for corruption 
the party must have someone who can command at least a minimum 
of trust thats the only way to quiet armenia grigoryants said 
in a telephone interview from his moscow home 
telephone calls to the official media and activist sources in 
armenia and azerbaijan either did not go through or went unanswered 
saturday 
grigoryants said the firing of bagirov also indicated that 
communist authorities recognized they could not control the unrest 
until he was removed 
armenians have accused azerbaijani leaders of encouraging the 
rioting in sumgait selection of a diplomat to be party leader 
indicated a deep distrust by moscow of officials in baku 
the rioting in sumgait began feb 28 about two weeks after 
massive demonstrations in yerevan and in nagornokarabakh 
nagornokarabakh was joined to azerbaijan in 1923 in the early 
days of soviet power 
central authorities in february rejected armenias demands to 
change jurisdiction over the region instead they announced a 
longterm program of social and economic development for the region 
the first of more than 80 people brought to trial in the sumgait 
riots azerbaijani metalworker talekh salekh ogli ismailov was 
found guilty monday of murder and sentenced to the maximum 15 years 
in prison 
armenian sources said 150000 people gathered in yerevan tuesday 
to stress that such convictions were not a solution to the areas 
ethnic problems 
about 30 armenians gathered across the street from the soviet 
supreme court in moscow on friday to demand the trial of the other 
suspects in the rioting be open to armenian observers and broadcast 
on television 
gorbachev had singled out demirchyan for personal criticism for 
the republics poor economic performance 
tass said vezirov the new azerbaijani party leader graduated 
from an industrial institute and worked in the republics young 
communist league from 1951 to 1970 he was involved in other party 
work until 1976 when he entered the diplomatic service 
he was consulgeneral in calcutta india ambassador in nepal 
and then in pakistan 
arutyunyan graduated from a veterinary school and joined the 
communist party at the age of 22 tass said 
he graduated from the vi lenin militarypolitical academy in 
moscow and obtained a degree in philosophy it said 
arutyunyan was a secretary of the young communist organization 
and began working in the communist party central committee in 1978

a journalist who nicaraguan 
authorities said infiltrated the cia denied being a paid spy for 
the sandinista government or infiltrating the us agency the 
newspaper barricada reported saturday 
the newspaper also quoted the interior ministry as saying that 
it wanted to clarify that the journalist undertook relations of 
cooperation with intelligence organisms of the nicaraguan 
government but was not an agent for them and was not infiltrated by 
the interior ministry into any foreign intelligence agency 
the statements from the ministry and from journalist maria 
lourdes pallais checa contradicted earlier statements by both 
on thursday barricada which belongs to the ruling sandinista 
national liberation front quoted interior minister tomas borge as 
saying ms pallais was a counterintelligence agent who worked in 
enemy ranks 
she carried out missions in the heart of the cia borge was 
quoted as saying 
at the time ms pallais lawyer ron kuby said in new york 
my client has instructed me to confirm the accuracy of mr 
borges statement 
in an interview published saturday ms pallais said she never 
did become what you might call an agent within the cia but only a 
collaborator of the nicaraguan government during a period that 
cultiminated towards the end of 1985 
kuby said saturdays article was meant to clarify that ms 
pallais was not a hired gun working for profit for nicaraguan 
intelligence 
kuby said initial reports in the american press implied that ms 
pallais was a fullfledged sandinista agent 
that was not the case he said she was never paid by the 
sandinistas or the cia but she worked with sandinista intelligence 
against the cia 
kuby said he spoke with ms pallais on saturday morning and said 
she told him the purpose of the barricada article was to show that 
she had never been a paid agent 
ms pallais a graduate from columbia university in new york is 
a niece of the late anastasio somoza the nicaraguan dictator 
overthrown by the sandinistas in july 1979 
she worked for the associated press in new york from august 1978 
until november 1979 first on the editing desk of the latin 
american service and then in the new york city bureau 
her brother marcel a supporter of the sandinista national 
liberation front was killed by somoza loyalists in october 1979 
ms pallais resigned from the ap in 1979 saying she wanted to 
investigate her brothers death and help care for her ailing mother 
the sandinista victory in july 1979 ended 42 years of rule in 
nicaragua by the rightist proamerican somoza family 
kuby said ms pallais is currently writing a book but said he 
did not know what it is about

it may sound like udder bull but a dairy 
specialist says a computer dating service that matches compatible 
bovines can yield a herd thats the cream of the crop 
michael tomaszewski a dairy expert with the texas agriculture 
extension service in dallas developed the program called herdmate 
any farmer who has a personal computer can use it to match cows 
with bulls to improve a dairy herd tomaszewski told the dallas 
times herald last week 
tomaszewski says his purpose is not to bring romance to the 
bovines but to help dairy farmers produce the best offspring they 
can 
for instance a farmer owning a cow with a particular weak trait 
can find a bull with a strong offsetting characteristic by using 
herdmate to locate available mates he said 
the software program debuted in late 1986 after development by 
tomaszewski and other agricultural specialists this year theres 
been more interest than in the past he said 
next in the evolution of tomaszewskis service will be version 
2 he says it will allow farmers to scrutinize bulls even more 
than now 
just like a stockbroker will analyze a portfolio of stocks 
farmers will be able to do the same thing with bulls he says

the swiss supreme court on saturday 
announced it has ordered a swiss bank to allow investigators to 
examine the bank account records of former philippine president 
ferdinand e marcos 
the court in a ruling made may 16 denied a request filed by 
the credit suisse in march to bar swiss investigators from 
examining the records 
the ruling was made to give swiss judicial authorities the 
possibility of locating any funds that might have been embezzled by 
the ousted leader or his family according to justice minstry 
spokesman joerg kistler 
the government of philippine president corazon aquino has 
accused the marcos family of corruption fraud embezzlement and 
other offenses and has asked switzerland to help it recover funds 
deposited in swiss accounts 
but the ruling does not mean that credit suisse must return the 
marcos fortune to philippine authorities kistler said he said a 
request by the aquino administration for a return of the money was 
still blocked by appeals and that the accounts have been frozen 
the manila government has estimated that 1 billion of the 
deposed leaders money was in swiss banks most of it in credit 
suisse but swiss bankers have said the amount is exaggerated

illinois bell is using the mail to reach 
thousands of customers in six western suburbs to make sure service 
is back after a twoweek disruption by a fire at a switching 
station 
illinois bell spokesman dick hill said that as of saturday 
almost all of the 35000 customers who lost dial tones after the 
may 8 fire have had partial service restored although there were 
still some spotty problems with about 200 to 300 lines still 
not working 
those people should have limited service restored by the end of 
the weekend 
to make sure they didnt miss anyone illinois bell officials 
took the unusual step of mailing postcards thursday to all 35000 
customers in the hinsdale area asking those still without phone 
service or with phonerelated problems to contact the company 
we thought this was about the fastest and the most 
effective way we could think of to get the message out hill 
said the postal service has been very helpful giving it special 
handling we couldnt possibly have called all 35000 of them 
the service disruptions have caused millions of dollars in 
business losses throughout the western suburbs 
hill said there were still problems restoring normal access to 
longdistance lines routed through the hinsdale switching station 
there is longdistance service available but its not up to 
the normal levels hill said normal longdistance service should 
be restored to the region during the upcoming week 
now its settling down to be a job to finish the installation 
of the new switching equipment he said 
about 250 bell employees were working around the clock through 
the weekend to install new stateoftheart switching equipment at 
the hinsdale center hill said 
were down to the very last ones hill said but were not 
sure how many of the 35000 lines we restored are working 
properly

points that the more you heat it and the more you beat it the 
sharper and the tougher it gets blanton said 
ive been that route and i hope it works the same way on me as 
it did on that hot steel 
blanton was convicted of extortion and mail fraud in 1981 and 
spent two years in federal prison but the mail fraud conviction 
has since been overturned and he is appealing the extortion and 
conspiracy charges 
in announcing his candidacy for the democratic nomination from 
the 8th congressional district blanton painted himself as a victim 
of a republican justice department lusting to bring down a 
democratic governor 
i want to show that because i have been mistreated falsely 
accused been made a political prisoner in the country i love that 
i dont give up on my love for this country he said 
blanton 58 is running for the congressional seat being vacated 
by rep ed jones a popular democrat who has represented the 
largely rural west tennessee district since 1968 
tennessees governor from 1975 to 1979 blanton was convicted of 
taking part in a scheme to sell state liquor licenses and his 
administration was rocked by allegations that prison inmates bought 
their way to freedom 
two former blanton aides also went to prison in the liquor 
license conspiracy and two other aides and a third man went to 
prison in the socalled clemency for cash scandal 
the former governors mail fraud conviction was recently 
overturned because of a supreme court decision restricting the 
definition of that offense blanton is appealing his conviction on 
extortion and conspiracy charges and his citizenship rights were 
restored by a federal court last fall 
i believe that the people of this district this state and 
this nation realize that what happened to me was purely 
political he said 
will jerry pillow a gibson county farmer who joined about 50 
blanton supporters for the campaign announcement at a jackson 
motel described the former governor as honest and humble 
this state owes him an apology and a vote for him for 
congress would be a step in the right direction pillow said 
blanton who represented tennessees 7th congressional district 
from 1967 to 1972 lives in nashville where he sells prefabricated 
industrial buildings he said he plans to move soon to madison 
county in west tennessee

secretary of state george p shultz called on the israeli 
government to accept an international peace conference and be ready 
to yield warwon territory 
in an israel television interview broadcast saturday shultz 
said israel must negotiate territory for peace if you say no 
then there is no arab partner that wants to come and negotiate 
because they say what is there to negotiate 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has rejected the proposal for an 
international peace conference on the grounds that israel would be 
isolated in a hostile forum and forced to make dangerous 
concessions he opposes giving up any of the occupied territories

haiti has joined panama as a growing drugsmuggling 
center and members of its dreaded secret police are muscling into 
crack cocaine distribution in florida witnesses told a special 
us senate hearing saturday 
the drug connection reaches high into the haitian government 
including interior and defense minister gen williams regala and 
his liaison officer to the us drug enforcement administration 
two haitians testified 
our intelligence indicates that major colombian trafficking 
organizations are using haiti as a base of operations tom cash 
head of dea in miami told sens alfonse damato rny and bob 
graham dfla 
haiti sits astride a natural drugsmuggling route from colombia 
providing planes and boats with a staging area for the last leg of 
the run into the bahamas and florida he said 
damato compared haiti to panama as a drug menace and noted 
that the military of the two nations had close communications 
birds of a feather flock together the senator said 
cash said the investigation that led to the miami indictment of 
haitian col jeanclaude paul in march for allegedly flying cocaine 
into florida is continuing but refused to say if higher haitian 
officials were implicated 
other witnesses said the army took in the secret police called 
tonton macoute after the overthrow of presidentforlife 
jeanclaude duvalier in 1986 and that soldiers and secret police 
now trafficked drugs in both haiti and the united states 
roger biamby director of the haitian american community 
association of dade testified that the haitian liaison to the new 
dea office in portauprince was a drug dealer who personally 
supervised cocaine loading operations on one us bound freighter 
regala paul and other officers have created an effective 
drugsmuggling network in haiti and the united states biamby 
said 
we must find out whether the people we are working with are 
the devils themselves damato demanded after the testimony 
fritz pierrelouis a former lieutenant in the haitian army who 
later defected said he personally turned over cocaine confiscated 
in raids to paul only to have it disappear he estimated that 70 
percent of pauls powerful dessalines barracks forces are involved 
in the trafficking 
earlier this year paul even raided an army jail to free some of 
his soldiers arrested for receiving cocaine at an airstrip said 
pierrelouis 
this incident indicates that col paul has if not the 
support at least the acquiescence of army headquarters in his drug 
operation he testified 
florida department of law enforcement spokesman michael 
lanfersiek said the haitian connection continued into street 
distribution in florida 
an informant stated that much of haitian crack cocaine 
distribution in this country was being directed by corrupt military 
officers and the former secret police of the duvalier regime the 
tonton macoute lanfersiek said 
haitian immigrants now control distribution of the potent 
cocaine derivative crack throughout south and central florida he 
said 
eduoard piou charge daffaires of the haitian embassy in 
washington disputed the testimony saying his country supported 
any effort to end drug trafficking 
piou acknowledged that haitian law does not allow paul to be 
extradited to the united states and said charges against him by a 
miami federal grand jury are under review by his government 
after paul was indicted in march the government of haitian 
president leslie manigat vowed to redouble its efforts to fight

president reagan met with his top advisers 
saturday to discuss policy on panama but an administration 
official said the 2hour session produced no deal to get gen 
manuel antonio noriega out of power 
there is no definitive deal or agreement or understanding 
with noriega said the official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified in response to a question he said also that it is 
safe to assume there is no tentative deal either at this 
stage 
roman popadiuk deputy white house press secretary for foreign 
affairs said there were no immediate plans for deputy 
assistant secretary of state michael g kozak who returned from 
panama on friday after talks with noriega to return to panama 
he will remain in washington for consultation popadiuk 
said kozak attended the meeting with the president and reported on 
his negotiations the spokesman said he added that no further 
meeting between kozak and the president had been set 
popadiuk said the president and his advisers met in the 
residential quarters of the white house the president left the 
meeting for a few minutes toward its end to deliver his weekly 
radio address 
popadiuk said the president convened the meeting to review the 
panama situation and hear deputy assistant secretary kozaks report 
on his discussions in panama 
also attending were vice president george bush secretary of 
state george p shultz secretary of defense frank c carlucci 
secretary of the treasury james baker iii white house chief of 
staff howard h baker jr attorney general edwin meese iii deputy 
white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein national security 
adviser colin powell deputy national security adviser john 
negroponte cia director william webster under secretary of state 
michael h armacost and elliott abrams the assistant secretary of 
state for interamerican affairs 
howard baker in an interview with cable news network that was 
taped friday for broadcast saturday said i believe in the final 
analysis that gen noriega will leave will leave power and leave 
the country but that is not a done deal 
baker said the indictment of noriega was a useful part of the 
technique to try to get noriega so that he can no longer use the 
government of panama the armed forces of panama to advance the 
cause of his own drug trafficking and trading 
bush and james baker were asked as they left the meeting whether 
a deal had been made neither man responded to the questions called 
out by reporters 
under an arrangement described by a us official on friday 
noriega would transfer power to an interim government that he would 
have a hand in selecting then noriega would leave the country for 
nine months returning after presidential elections are held in may 
1989 said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states would drop federal drug trafficking charges 
pending against noriega 
dismissing the drug indictment and giving noriega a role in 
setting up the transition government were said to be the elements 
that some administration figures were having the most difficulty 
swallowing 
that difficulty was reflected earlier in the week by an 8610 
senate vote against any concession that would lead to dismissal of 
the drug smuggling indictments 
the state department view is that dropping the indictments 
against noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he 
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in panama 
the reagan administration has been urging noriega to step down 
since the indictments were returned on feb 5 and has since 
refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government headed by a 
noriegaapproved president 
the united states imposed massive economic sanctions against 
panama hoping to break noriegas grip on power but the strategy 
so far has failed

defrocked tv evangelist jimmy swaggart 
plans to return to the pulpit sunday three months after he made a 
tearful confession of sin and was accused of hiring a prostitute to 
pose for him in a motel room 
the ensuing fight in the assemblies of god over the length of 
swaggarts punishment led to his dismissal from the pentecostal 
denomination april 8 
it has been nearly three months since i stepped down from the 
ministry and now we feel that it is in gods timing for us to come 
back swaggart said in the may issue of the evangelist the 
magazine of jimmy swaggart world ministries 
he said his return to his ministrys family worship center 
sanctuary which is not scheduled to be televised live will be a 
glorious time as the choir starts to sing the beginning song and 
the 7000strong congregation joins in 
his return comes amid financial problems for his ministry the 
resignations of several key administrators and a report that 
several toplevel officials will leave jimmy swaggart bible

pictures 
a prostitute has said that swaggart paid her to pose nude for 
him the woman debra murphree is scheduled to be the subject of a 
photo spread and interview in penthouse magazine next month 
swaggarts hiatus is in accordance with a threemonth suspension 
ordered by the louisiana council of the assemblies shortly after 
his confession 
national leaders of the denomination however overruled the 
state council and ordered swaggart out of the pulpit and off 
television for at least a year swaggart refused and the 
denomination dismissed him after he submitted his resignation 
swaggart who has avoided preaching on television during his 
exile recently appeared on a telethon in which he said the 
ministry needs 6 million much of it to pay stations that carry 
his programs 
we are scraping the bottom swaggart said on the telecast 
ministry officials refuse to say how much was raised however 
swaggarts appearance led three cable television outlets the ptl 
network the christian broadcasting network and black entertainment 
television to cancel his programs the three networks reach a 
total of about 70 million homes 
on friday the baton rouge statetimes reported that a number of 
toplevel administrators plan to leave the bible college 
several weeks ago at least six highranking officials of 
swaggarts ministry left their posts including two who started 
their own churches in the baton rouge area 
ministry officials have been silent about the reports but the 
ministrys magazine makes it clear there are financial problems an 
advertisement boosting seven crusades scheduled by swaggart for the 
rest of the year notes that one in june in toronto has been 
postponed 
in the back of the magazine a fourpage spread notes that such 
items as a videotape of the best of jimmy swaggart and record 
albums of swaggarts songs are available at cutrate prices 
weve slashed prices on overstocked ministry items save up to 
50 percent the advertisement proclaims 
despite the problems swaggart said he is confident his ministry 
will survive and prosper 
speaking to about 300 people at a prayer meeting wednesday 
night swaggart described himself as an unworthy vessel and a 
crippled preacher but said he still carries gods word 
he god does not abrogate calls he does not call and 
change his mind swaggart said god will allow many things to 
happen that will bring things to pass that he wants to come to 
pass

smiles handshakes and summit meetings aside good 
feelings toward americans engendered by the upcoming visit of 
president reagan have their limit soviets still dont care much 
for rambo 
a correspondent for the soviet government newspaper izvestia got 
a sneak preview of the movie rambo iii in new york recently 
he didnt like it any better than his colleagues liked any of 
the previous rambo movies 
a shalnev wrote in saturdays edition of izvestia that rambo 
iii scheduled to be released may 25 could be considered 
entertainment only if the definition included a torrent of blood 
and the crunch of broken bones 
shalnev said a representative of the film company told him the 
movie had no political intent but he wrote the thought of the 
film its goal is politics the politics is of very evil very 
militaristic antisovietism 
the dialogue is minimal when the heroes want to speak they 
talk not in words but in slogans he said 
shalnev said the film takes sylvester stallone in the title role 
to afghanistan to teach antigovernment rebels how to use stinger 
antiaircraft missiles 
soviet soldiers began withdrawing from afghanistan on may 15 
under an agreement reached in geneva april 14 and guaranteed by the 
united states and the soviet union they must be totally out of the 
country within nine months 
the united states and reagan who once called the soviet union 
an evil empire are receiving more positive treatment as 
relations gradually improve and the us president prepares to 
travel to moscow for his fourth meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
but shalnev questioned why the film was being released the day 
reagan leaves washington for helsinki finland on his way to 
moscow 
soviet media bitterly criticized previous rambo movies and 
other similar films that they said made enemies of reds who 
should be killed killed killed 
writers attributed such films to a cult of violence in the 
united states and an effort to erase the memory of the vietnam war

a leading communist party member on 
saturday defended his plan to allow independent trade unions and 
political groups in a spirited attack on the ideals of aging party 
boss janos kadar 
imre pozsgay a central committee member and leading reformist 
in the party called for a broadening of civil law to give 
hungarians more of a voice in national affairs 
pozsgay made his speech to a national communist party conference 
amid speculation that kadar would be replaced by premier karoly 
grosz 
there was also speculation that kadar who has run the party for 
31 years would be appointed party president a ceremonial post 
created to ease him into retirement the 75yearold hungarian 
leader has been under pressure from many reformists to resign 
he no longer has the support of the party said one 
prominent official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
janos berecz the partys chief ideologist told reporters late 
saturday he heard talk of creating a new post of party president 
and that if it is proposed it will meet with the support of the 
conference 
on friday kadar lauded the benefits of singleparty rule and 
condemned demands for political change that he said would undermine 
party control 
kadars conservative assault was clearly aimed at pozsgay and 
other advocates of political change who have expressed support for 
independent political and trade union groups in hungary 
pozgay launched his defense 
we need a new socialist pluralism so that we can work to make 
socialism more attractive a socialism based on individual 
responsibility pozsgay said 
we must do away with barriers or barriers will destroy us 
hungarys first independent trade union was formed last week 
and a growing number of other groups are seeking official 
recognition outside the umbrella of the communist party 
pozsgay on saturday reaffirmed his support for changes to the 
constitution that would guarantee the independence of interest 
groups outside the party 
he also said saturday that hungary was considering merging the 
posts of party general secretary and premier in a move that could 
lead to kadars ouster 
this could happen provisionally although i am not certain 
that it will pozsgay said we have gone further than than we 
expected 
earlier saturday grosz 57 told the delegates that the party 
should break with the practice of secretiveness selfisolation 
and inflexible working style 
while he affirmed the role of the communist party leadership 
grosz said the party must rid itself of ideological prejudices 
if economic and political reforms are to succeed 
kadar pioneered economic reforms that led hungary to relative 
prosperity in the late 1960s and 1970s but is increasingly blamed 
for recent economic setbacks and for resistance to political change 
a western diplomatic source who spoke to the associated press 
on condition of anonymity said there appeared to be a growing 
consensus within the party that kadar would be asked to step 
dowen 
but the diplomat said kadar who has led the party since the 
kremlin crushed an antisoviet uprising in 1956 may still have 
considerable support among the partys old guard 
personnel changes are not expected to be announced until after 
the conference concludes sunday 
reformists say economic reforms will fail without sweeping 
political changes 
inflation in hungary reached 185 percent in the first quarter 
of this year and its gross foreign debt has mounted steadily to 
18 billion 
austerity measures implemented earlier this year to curb 
inflation and economic stagnation have hurt many hungarian 
pocketbooks

the fbi knew about laurie dann so did 
prosecutors in three states so did her neighbors and her former 
husband and inlaws 
prosecutors were trying to track her down for making harassing 
telephone calls and threats as she became increasingly disturbed 
but they were losing a race with time 
after awhile you start to develop a sixth sense for these 
things said lake county states attorney fred foreman said i 
had a feeling that this person was about to explode 
on friday the 30yearold woman set fire to the house where she 
worked as a babysitter went to an elementary school and shot six 
children killing one then wounded a 20yearold man in a nearby 
house and barricaded herself there 
the ninehour ordeal ended friday night when police discovered 
that ms dann had shot herself to death 
authorities said saturday they believe ms dann also tried to 
deliver poison to several families she once worked for gave 
arseniclaced snacks to two northwestern university fraternities 
sickening several people 
laurie dann left a long trail that led to fridays rampage 
among other things she had harassed an old boyfriend for two 
years with telephone calls and she was known for her odd behavior 
at an apartment complex in madison wis where she was found last 
week lying on garbage bags 
her former husband woke up one night in may 1986 to find himself 
bleeding from a stab wound made with an ice pick he suspected his 
wife 
ms dann was charged about a year ago with misdemeanor 
harrassment by telephone after authorities traced harassment calls 
to a place where she had lived said assistant lake county states 
attorney michael waller charges were dropped after authorities 
found out others had access to the same telephone 
the evidence that she was violent was thin and proper 
procedures had to be followed her old boyfriend a doctor in 
tucson ariz refused to press charges and some families ms dann 
worked for as a babysitter praised her work 
if only we had known said dan knauss an assistant us 
attorney in tucson ariz but you cant anticipate things like 
this 
herbert timm police chief of this affluent chicago suburb said 
that ms dann had been seeing a psychiatrist 
we know she had been undergoing some psychiatric care the 
full extent we are not privy to yet and i dont know if we ever 
will be because of the confidentiality factor 
at some point timm said she obtained a firearms owners 
identification card allowing her to possess the three guns she 
used friday 
anyone can get one by filling out a form and basically sending 
in 5 to the state police this allows you to buy weapons and 
purchase ammunition timm said 
it is supposed to be some kind of control mechanism but 
obviously it isnt sufficient 
authorities in arizona said saturday they had been ready to 
indict ms dann for making a threatening phone call to a man she 
had dated at the university of arizona in the late 1970s 
but janet johnson another federal prosecutor in tucson said 
the man feared retaliation and asked officials to look for evidence 
that she also had threatened others so he would not be the only one 
to bring charges 
ms johnson refused to identify the man but said he had received 
harassing phone calls on and off since 1985 and on may 9 ms dann 
threatened his life ms johnson said 
we were not planning to dump the case just trying to get some 
telephone calls from other jurisdictions ms johnson said you 
need time to get those records to prove an interstate connection 
the fbi had looked for her in madison but she had 
disappeared we knew we were going to try to follow up leads but 
she was lost so there wasnt much we could do 
in madison where she sometimes lived ms dann also was known 
for her strange behavior police went to her apartment one day last 
week and found her lying on some trash bags said fbi agent john 
wendet she also had been arrested there in march in a shoplifting 
incident 
she was dubbed the elevator woman because she rode the 
elevator for extended periods night and day in the highrise 
residence where she lived according to former neighbor keith 
wilson she was a loner never seen sharing a meal with a friend 
ms dann the daughter of a glencoe ill accountant came to 
the attention of illinois authorities after she filed for divorce 
in 1986 from russell dann a highland park insurance man stabbed 
with an ice pick the same year 
russell danns family also reported he had received threatening 
phone calls from the woman foreman became convinced she would 
explode after he talked to her former inlaws in april but he felt 
he didnt have enough evidence to make an arrest 
russell dann went to bed at night and woke up with a puncture 
wound in his chest foreman said but there was no one around 
his wife wasnt living there what police came up with was a guy 
waking up with a puncture wound in his chest if youre a 
prosecutor you know a judge wont issue a warrant based on that 
but we were very concerned and we continued to work on the 
complaints about harassing phone calls when the fbi came into the 
case in arizona we thought we had finally put something 
together 
complicating their case authorities said was that along with 
all the reports of bizarre behavior they also received praise 
about ms dann from families who continued to use her as a 
babysitter 
we had no real problems at all said craig byless of 
winnetka who recalled that ms dann looked after his daughter last 
summer he called the woman a fine babysitter and a nice 
quiet girl 
foreman and knauss noted that in most such cases people charged 
with making harassment threats are released on bond after 
misdemeanor charges 
a prison term is rarely given knauss said a lot of these 
things arise out of personal or business disputes 
if you think about it how were we going to control her i 
dont know how she got licensed with a gun said foreman we 
dont create evidence we just cant walk out and point at somebody 
and say hey you dont look good youve got to go to jail

democratic presidential candidate jesse 
jackson told shipbuilders and homecare workers to fight for their 
jobs as he attended two labor rallies saturday and quickly denied 
reports he had been hospitalized 
you dont need icantremember bush or a palmreading 
stargazing president you need someone who is alert jackson 
told about 700 people at a shipyard labor rally 
when i become president you workers will have a friend in the 
white house 
the rally in a parking lot across from todd pacific shipyard 
began an hour late after a speaker announced from the podium that 
the delay was due to jackson being hospitalized in san francisco 
with a stomach ailment 
rick roberts his local campaign spokesman also confirmed the 
hospitalization report but jackson immediately denied it when he 
took the platform at noon 
let me set the record straight this morning in san francisco 
we sat on the runway for nearly an hour and it threw our plane 
late jackson said 
there was some rumor about my health my health is fantastic 
aint nothing wrong with me feel so good i want to jump off the 
stage feel so fine he said 
he was not hospitalized thats not true he was late because 
we couldnt get off the tarmac said national jackson campaign 
spokeswoman delmarie cobb 
cobb said somehow there was miscommunication between san 
francisco and los angeles and the report of hospitalization should 
not have been announced 
she said jackson had received no medical attention in san 
francisco and did not know how the report originated or how why it 
was announced 
we dont know the genesis of it all cobb said 
apparently from what i heard someone stood up on the stage and 
said that 
cobb said she learned of the announcement when she was met by a 
rush of reporters when she arrived with jackson after eating 
dinner in oakland friday night jackson and the staff returned to 
their hotel she said 
we were up bright and early this morning and nothing happened 
in between she said 
at san francisco general hospital a nursing supervisor who 
refused to identify herself said saturday that a man named jesse 
jackson was admitted to the hospital friday evening but it was not 
the candidate 
its not the presidential candidate he is not here and has 
never been here our poor gentleman just happens to have the same 
name the nursing supervisor said refusing to release additional 
details 
parents hoisted children on their shoulders to see jackson and 
there was enthusiasm despite the smallerthanexpected turnout 
organizers had predicted that thousands would attend the rally 
i wish there would have been more people said ej march 
36 a 10year veteran of todd hes always supported labor and 
weve never had anyone whos supported labor 
according to speakers and flyers handed out at the rally the 
workforce at todd has decreased from 5000 to 900 in less than 
three years mainly due to business going to cheaper yards overseas 
in the afternoon jackson appeared at a rally of 1500 homecare 
workers at the los angeles trade technical college 
the mostly minority and female crowd of workers who care for 
elderly and disabled people in their homes yelled jesse jesse 
and clapped their hands as jackson told them he identified with 
them 
i stand with working people jackson said at the plant 
gate i stand with you at the bus stop i stand with you in the 
kitchen i stand with you at the hotel i stand with you pushing 
other peoples babies down the street trying to make a living i 
stand with you raising other peoples children cant raise your

americans and nine other foreign hostages being held in lebanon 
and the imminent deployment of syrian troops in south beirut 
walters said that during the talks there was a recognition of 
the fact that this the deployment could work two ways 
in one way it could work to endanger the hostages and in 
another way it could work such that it would not endanger them and 
would make the hostages safe he said 
most of the hostages are held in the slums by 
hezbollahaffiliated kidnappers 
i dont want to go into the detail im sure that the 
president assad is very much aware of the possible dangers and 
the possible advantages of such an action walters said

or the other 
irana proxy force hezbollah or party of god has wrested 
control of beiruts southern slums from the syrianbacked amal in

dominate lebanons 12 million shiite moslems through hezbollah at 
the time efforts are focused on eliminating lebanons sectarian 
feuds to establish a secular system of government

have and i am still working on exerting pressure to reach a 
humanitarian solution to this problem he said without 
specifying who he was exerting pressure on

he said he wanted to keep the americans name secret to avoid 
putting him or mccarthy in danger

he was by the hostage issue 
i am stirred by this issue which is a humanitarian one 
although it has been placed within a political framework he said 
in an earlier interview saturday barnett had said he did not 
know how the petition with 40000 signatures from various 
countries would be delivered 
an aide to barnett said the petition was not actually delivered 
to fadlallah but that the shiite leader considers it as good as 
done 
he said fadlallah showed deep concern and thanked all those who 
made this great effort 
barnett 50 has met fadlallah twice on previous trips to west 
beirut over the last two years

roman catholic priests and nuns led 
about 1000 demonstrators in a march to the senate building 
saturday to press for comprehensive land reform 
the demonstrators carried signs which read land to the 
tillers and our land our life they snarled traffic as they 
blocked off the road in front of the senate office building for two 
hours the senate was closed for the weekend 
this is to show that the church is all the way behind a truly 
comprehensive agrarian reform that is propoor and that will 
promote social justice said manila auxiliary bishop teodoro 
bacani 
negotiators are trying to reconcile differences between two 
versions of a reform bill passed by both houses of the 
americanstyle legislature 
many people view land reform as a solution to the 19yearold 
communist insurgency since a majority of the marxist rebels are 
peasants 
also saturday a news report said a guerrilla commander denied 
allegations communist rebels accepted money from foreign 
journalists in exchange for staging ambushes against the military 
the communist new peoples army commander ernesto bergola made 
the statement friday to filipino journalists at his mountain 
hideout about 30 miles north of manila the manila chronicle 
newspaper said 
the nationally circulated newspaper said bergola admitted 
guerrillas accept donations from anybody without strings 
attached but denied collecting money from journalists to stage 
ambushes 
two weeks ago the military said it had evidence showing foreign 
journalists were present during an ambush on feb 27 which killed 
11 soldiers a rebel who surrendered said the ambush was staged 
after a group of foreign journalists paid guerrillas about 20000 
to film it 
manila newspapers quoting military officials earlier 
identified the film crew as members of the british broadcasting 
corp but the military has since denied having identified the crew 
and the bbc denied it had a crew in the area at the time 
the armed forces announced friday it had invited a hong 
kongbased american reporter of newsweek to shed light on the 
incident after the magazine reported details of the ambush in its 
april 4 issue

shell oil co has doubled its size 
estimate for last months crude oil spill that soiled hundreds of 
boats and killed 200 birds and animals in a wildlife habitat 
under orders from state investigators shell reexamined its 
figures and said friday that about 365000 gallons spilled during 
the april 23 leak of san joaquin crude into environmentally 
sensitive peyton marsh 
since may 2 shell has insisted that only 175000 gallons leaked 
from the 125milliongallon storage tank at its martinez refinery 
after a drain hose broke 
in the days following the accident shell insisted less than 
4000 gallons of the thick petroleum had escaped 
independent consultants working for the state bay regional water 
quality control agency will review the new estimate state 
regulators ordered the review of shells spill estimate because 
cleanup crews appeared to be recovering far more oil than shell had 
admitted leaked 
the revision came after shell discovered that refinery employees 
working on the spill estimate erroneously used a formula commonly 
employed when extracting oil from a drilling mixture of oil water 
and sand shell spokesman bill sharkey said 
technicians subtracted from the percentage of the oilwater 
mixture recovered by cleanup workers a set percentage used in 
drilling for determining sediment and water 
as for the cleanup theres still an awful lot of oil in 
sensitive wildlife areas said michael rugg a state fish and 
game department biologist 
under guidance from the wildlife agency shell is draining the 
100acre marsh grasses will be mowed to remove the stickiest oil 
and the marsh will be flooded again in october

rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre on 
saturday confirmed reports he and the vatican have reached an 
agreement allowing him to consecrate new bishops 
lefebvre confirmed the reports after ordaining 26 deacons at his 
traditionalist seminary in econe he said he signed the agreement 
may 5 with cardinal josef ratzinger head of the congregation for 
the doctrine of the faith or the vaticans guardian of theological 
orthodoxy 
lefebvre did not give details of the agreement he said it did 
not specify the date and number of bishops he could consecrate but 
he said he wanted to go ahead with his plans to consecrate bishops 
on june 30 in econe 
the archbishop said he was traveling to rome sunday to hold 
further talks with ratzinger 
in 1976 pope paul vi suspended lefebvre 82 from his priestly 
duties including saying mass because he refused to recognize the 
results of the second vatican council in the 1960s 
in defiance of the vatican lefebvre has ordained priests and 
celebrated the tridentine mass a banned 16th century liturgy in 
latin he claims millions of followers and sympathizers around the 
world and much enthusiasm for the latin mass 
without vatican permission his consecration of bishops would 
lead to excommunication from the roman catholic church and set the 
stage for a possible schism

democratic rivals michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson were continuing their dialogue saturday while vice 
president george bush was making his strongest move so far away 
from president reagan 
dukakis aiming to lock up the democratic presidential 
nomination in the final primaries on june 7 completed a california 
campaign swing with a visit to a community health clinic and then 
planned to attend a fundraiser in st louis before flying home to 
boston 
jackson appearing at a rally at a shipyard in san pedro denied 
reports circulated by a campaign staff member earlier in the day 
that he had been hospitalized friday night in san francisco 
possibly for a stomach ailment 
there was some rumor about my health jackson told the 
crowd my health is fantastic aint nothing wrong with me feel 
so good i want to jump off the stage feel so fine 
dukakis during a stop at a community clinic told the mostly 
hispanic crowd that if elected president he would put basic 
health insurance for all of our citizens at the top of the national 
agenda 
dukakis said he would build coalitions with representatives of 
business labor and politics to enact legislation that would 
require businesses to provide health insurance for their employees 
he recently signed such an insurance plan into law in his home 
state 
dukakis received a loud round of applause at the clinic when he 
lapsed into spanish which he speaks fluently 
bush who attended a 2hour meeting at the white house had no 
response when reporters called out questions to him as he left the 
session on us policy on panama 
meanwhile cbs news citing unnamed republican sources saturday 
said treasury secretary james a baker iii would take over running 
the bush campaign next month but baker told cbs that he was not 
preparing to leave his cabinet post to go to work for the campaign 
in an interview on his campaign plane late friday the 
massachusetts governor said he had talked earlier in the day by 
telephone with jackson 
he did not say what they talked about but described his contacts 
with jackson as routine 
what we try to do is arrange things so that when our paths 
cross we spend some time together said dukakis 
he rejected the notion that he was negotiating with jackson 
we respect each other we like each other he said we 
agree on some things we disagree on others its a good 
relationship and it will continue to be 
jackson told the shipyard crowd which heard earlier that the 
candidate had been hospitalized that flight delays not an illness 
was the reason he was late 
let me set the record straight this morning in san francisco 
we sat on the runway for nearly an hour and threw our plane late 
he said 
but rick roberts a spokesman in jacksons los angeles office 
said earlier he was hospitalized we dont know for sure what it 
was 
it was a possible stomach ailment we dont want to speculate 
until the national campaign people get here roberts said 
jackson was appearing at the rally and then attending three 
fundraisers in the los angeles area 
there are 466 democratic delegates at stake in the partys final 
four primaries on june 7 california is the biggest prize with 314 
while new jersey has 109 the other two primaries were new mexico 
with 24 delegates and montana with 19 
in colorado backers of dukakis on friday withdrew their 
challenge of a decision to add 198 jackson representatives to the 
democratic state convention the states democrats are meeting this 
weekend to finalize delegates to the national convention in 
atlanta july 1821 
evelyn davidson representing 18 denver democrats who challenged 
the expanded convention delegation on may 2 said that although 
party rules were violated the jackson delegates would not change 
the final outcome 
mike dukakis will clearly win the nomination one or two 
delegates from denver will make no significant difference ms 
davidson said 
in vermont republicans and democrats also held their respective 
state conventions this weekend to determine the delegates to the 
national convention 
dukakis was sounding increasingly certain of getting enough 
delegates on june 7 to top the 2081 needed for a convention 
majority 
during his latest campaign swing through california he often 
made only passing reference to the primary while tailoring his 
rhetoric to his anticipated confrontation with bush in the fall 
dukakis is heavily favored to defeat jackson in california and 
new jersey 
the massachusetss governor stopped in missouri on his way back 
east and was introduced at a fundraiser in creve coeur by former 
democratic rival rep richard gephardt 
because of dukakis thousands and millions of people who voted 
for ronald reagan in 1984 are going to vote democratic in 1988 
the missouri congressman said 
bush with the republican nomination already locked up appeared 
to have found the issue on which to separate himself from the 
president the controversial negotiations with panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega 
the administration according to a state department source was 
considering a deal in which noriega would leave panama for nine 
months in exchange for the united states dropping drug charges 
against him 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said friday that 
administration sources who have suggested that the vice president 
favors ending the negotiations with noriega and bringing the 
envoy back to washington are essentially correct 
in an interview with cable news network white house staff chief 
howard h baker jr said bush had stated his differences with the 
noriega negotiations persistently and enthusiastically 
george bush must stake out his position as a candidate for 
president of the united states said baker 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas who made an unsuccessful 
bid for the gop presidential nomination said republican candidates 
could suffer if the reagan administration drops charges against 
noriega 
i dont want the administration to make a mistake dole said 
at a news conference at mississippis republican state convention 
in jackson were in quicksand if we start dismissing 
indictments political quicksand 
at a news conference in sacramento on friday dukakis demanded 
that the administration explain its past dealings with noriega 
i and the american people want an explanation of what this 
administration has been doing doing business with noriega said 
dukakis 
the massachusetts governor has made denunciations of us 
dealings with noriega a standard part of his stump speeches 
jackson also denounced administration dealings with the 
panamanian 
noriega is not plea bargaining with reagan and bush said 
jackson reagan and bush are plea bargaining with noriega we 
need to know whats going on 
send a special prosecutor to panama send a congressional 
delegation to panama hear both sides of an ugly story

georgias republican convention adjourned in 
chaos saturday after supporters of pat robertson shouted down 
speakers and promised to hold their own meeting to pick delegates 
to the gop national convention 
the business of this convention cannot proceed said john 
stuckey chairman of the state republican party the 18 delegates 
at large cannot be elected 
several hundred of the state delegates left the albany civic 
center after stuckeys announcement which he based on the 
recommendation of the credentials committee about 750 state 
delegates remained for the dissidents convention 
party dissidents quickly took control of the convention hall and 
selected 
18 delegates and then considered a party platform and debated 
changes to party rules 
supporters of the television evangelist who suspended his bid 
for the republican nomination last week marched through the 
convention hall and shouted down speakers on friday they won a 
court order saturday ordering the admission of delegates previously 
denied because of missed deadlines for filing paperwork 
party leaders had disqualified more than 900 delegates to the 
state convention claiming they were chosen in improperly conducted 
district conventions many of them were robertson backers 
stuckey said the several court orders issued in the delegate 
battle made it impossible to conduct business in an orderly fashion 
he did not say how the party would select the 18 delegates but 
said the 30 national delegates already named at district

an 11month investigation into reports of 
sexual abuse at a daycare home has triggered fears that a satanic 
cult may have preyed on children a denver newspaper reported 
no criminal charges have been filed and the daycare home 
operator denies the charges 
the denver post said in a story in its sunday editions that 
seven children who attended the home have recently received 
therapy five continue with therapists paid for through the 
states victim compensation fund 
authorities believe at least two other children could be 
victims the post reported but their parents have refused to 
cooperate with investigators 
these are by far the most severely disturbed children i have 
ever seen an unnamed childcare expert told the newspaper the 
emotional impacts are astounding entire families are thrown into 
chaos over this 
one youngster described vivid details involving a ceremonial 
decapitation of a young boy named bobby washington county 
undersheriff steve vosburg says he regards that report very 
seriously although no body has been found and no local children 
have been reported missing 
other children told of rape and sodomy inflicted by masked and 
hooded adults during ceremonial torture sessions one 4yearold 
identified a pentagram a common satanic symbol and associated 
it with the daycare home the post said 
during therapy or as told to parents the post said the 
children have described adults who frightened them with guns 
knives swords power saws and cattle prods 
the daycare home was operated by hazel riggs 67 who 
surrendered her license sept 15 10 weeks after she was 
questioned by vosburg and a social worker 
i completely deny all these charges and hope you look into 
this case thoroughly because this is not true she wrote in a 
sept 15 response to a letter from elizabeth kester the states 
licensing administrator i do not wish to do any more daycare 
vosburg says the case remains open 
a search of the daycare home on may 5 turned up no evidence 
vosburg said his investigation is further harmed he said by 
parents who refuse to allow their children to be interviewed 
district attorney doyle t johns who is responsible for filing 
charges refused to comment saying he does not discuss active 
investigations 
although he is skeptical of any links to devil worship vosburg 
adds id like to know where the children are getting these 
stories if theres nothing to them 
therapists parents and social workers are less willing than 
vosburg to dismiss a satanic link we know it is going on an 
unnamed county official told the post we just cant prove it 
disturbances among the children who range from preschool age to 
about 12 include depression and suicidal feelings nightmares 
regressive development outbursts against other children spells of 
fear and terror and general distrust the newspaper said

a federal judge was shot and killed at his 
home in this wealthy new york city suburb saturday by an assailant 
who then committed suicide police said 
it was believed to be only the second slaying of a federal judge 
this century 
richard j daronco 56 was in a garden at the side of his home 
when a man approached with a handgun about 215 pm police chief 
anthony m quatroni said 
the judge fled to the back yard where he was shot several 
times he said 
daronco then ran into the house followed by the attacker 
inside another shot was fired apparently that of the gunman 
committing suicide quatroni said 
daroncos wife a daughter and her boyfriend were in the house 
when the attack occured and alerted neighbors who called for 
police according to a police officer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
quatroni said only that family members were home at some point 
during the day and that police were investigating whether there 
were any witnesses 
police arrived within a few minutes and found a man on the 
ground floor with a gunshot wound to the head and a 38caliber 
revolver near his hand quatroni said 
daronco was found in a study a few feet away his sweatshirt and 
sweatpants soaked in blood he said 
daronco died of multiple gunshot wounds to various parts of the 
body said dr louis roh deputy medical examiner for westchester 
county who pronounced both men dead at the scene about 4 pm 
roh said the other man who he described as white and in his 
late 60s died of a single gunshot wound to the head apparently 
from the same gun 
quatroni said police were checking the name on a pistol permit 
found on the attackers body but had been unable to identify the 
assailant 
the attacker arrived at the scene in a car quatroni said but 
he would not say where the car was he also said he did not know of 
any words having been exchanged by the judge and his assailant 
he said police were investigating whether any threats had been 
made against the judge 
it was shocking because he daronco was a man respected by 
the entire community said quatroni 
westchester county district attorney carl a vergari said 
investigators would try to determine whether the killing was 
connected with a case daronco handled 
obviously when you have a judge who sat on courts with 
criminal jurisdiction that would be the first place to look would 
it not where hes killed in this manner vergari said at the 
scene 
the judge and his wife joan orourke were married in 1957 and 
have five grown children 
he was a family man he was a churchgoer he was always out 
working on his house said william hynes a neighbor 
another neighbor joseph kish who said he had known daronco for 
14 years called the judge a wonderful person a beautiful 
neighbor a great family man hes gonna be missed its a terrible 
tragedy 
daronco was appointed in 1987 as a federal judge for the 
southern district of new york 
his brother paul is the supervisor in this affluent town of 
about 5000 people just north of new york city in westchester 
county 
daronco was born and reared in pelham and attended providence 
college in rhode island and the albany law school of union 
university 
daronco began his judicial career in 1971 when gov nelson a 
rockefeller appointed him to westchester county family court in 
1984 daronco was elevated from a state judgeship in white plains 
to deputy chief administrative judge of the states office of court 
administration

christians must overcome the rubble 
along the road to christian unity the general secretary of the 
national council of churches told religious and lay leaders 
saturday 
the rev arie r brouwer gave the opening sermon in a fiveday 
meeting sponsored by the national council of churches that 
includes seven worship services 53 workshops and 26 forums 
an estimated 1500 religious and lay leaders from around the 
world were attending what sponsors called a religious 
smorgasboard a broadly ecumenical meeting of protestant 
catholic evangelical and orthodox christians 
the event called a gathering of christians runs through 
wednesday 
brouwer compared the rubble obstructing christian unity to 
stones 
we need to pick our way around them we need to climb over 
them we need to sprint ahead in those places where the road is 
clear that is the task of christian unity 
the obstacles to christian unity are mostly isms 
traditionalism racism sexism nationalism classism 
triumphalism sectarianism ecumenism he said 
the problem is in the ism when love of nation becomes an 
america first movement giving second place to love justice 
peace and truth brouwer said 
when concern for personal renewal becomes privatism when zeal 
for the public order leads to the sacrifice of personal wellbeing 
when unity is sought at any price these are a few of the things 
that divide the human community and the christian community 
brouwer added 
later in the week the councils 260member governing board will 
consider whether to endorse an international boycott of shell oil 
which operates in south africa to protest apartheid

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told us 
journalists this week he is optimistic about prospects for a 
ussoviet agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic 
nuclear weapons before president reagan leaves office 
gorbachev in an interview in moscow with the washington post 
and newsweek magazine also said he will ask reagan to approve a 
joint sovietus unmanned flight to mars when the two men meet in 
moscow for the may 29june 2 summit 
details of the interview and gorbachevs answers to written 
questions submitted in march were released saturday by newsweek and 
published in sunday editions of the post editors from the two news 
organizations interviewed gorbachev for 90 minutes on wednesday 
asked about his answer to a written question on the 50percent 
reduction in strategic offensive weapons gorbachev said we want 
to have that signed 
he said if the agreement comes to be drafted under the present 
us administration i see no reason why president reagan and i 
should not sign it i would certainly welcome that 
asked to evaluate reagan gorbachev responded im not 
particularly fond of giving personal character references but 
since you ask i would like to say that realism is an important 
quality in president reagan as a politician 
by this i mean the ability to adapt ones views to the 
changing situation while remaining faithful to ones convictions 
in maintaining a positive tone in advance of the upcoming 
summit gorbachev referred to the alreadysigned ussoviet treaty 
to reduce mediumrange missiles and said who would have thought 
in the early 80s that it would be president reagan who would 
sign with us the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in history 
gorbachev cautioned that he has no plans to set aside unresolved 
disputes in order hasten a treaty on strategic weapons 
in our assessment we have covered together a long road in the 
search for conclusions to all questions gorbachev said but i 
think you would agree with me that if i say that if we sign with 
one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive forces in one area 
and at the same time launch an arms race in space or at sea what 
would be the point that would be senseless 
he said the soviet position was not capricious but fully thought 
out and responsible and he reiterated opposition to the reagan 
administrations planned star wars missile defense program known 
formally as the strategic defense initiative 
if we just replace one kind of arms race with another 
particularly in space where the arms race would take a 
particularly dramatic turn we would undermine the trust that has 
begun to be built we would make worthless all the experience that 
we have accumulated at the geneva negotiations he said 
this new kind of arms race new sphere for an arms race new 
criteria it would take decades to reach some kind of agreement 
and come to an agreement 
gorbachev said the leader who promotes an escalation of the arms 
race in space is committing a crime against the people his own 
people and others that must be said with all responsibility and 
with clarity 
such an approach such an idea is a road to destabilization 
to unpredictability on matters of security he said this must 
be condemned the initiator of such an approach must be pilloried 
as for sealaunched cruise missiles gorbachev said this 
would also be a roundabout maneuver that could become a new avenue 
for the arms race and therefore we are linking all those 
questions together and we believe that this is a fair approach 
what is more i have to say that we see genuine possibilities 
to resolve all those questions to resolve all of them together and 
to have a treaty on a 50percent reduction of strategic offensive 
arms and then to continue farther he said 
on his proposal to reagan for a joint mission to mars gorbachev 
said why shouldnt we work together we have great experience 
you have great experience let us cooperate to master the cosmos 
to fulfill big programs and whatever is being done in outer space 
and whatever is being done in sdi to achieve new technological 
breakthroughs 
as a result of a joint project to study halleys comet we 
have been able to develop dozens of new materials we have been 
able to make major advances in electronics and mathematics this 
resulted really in major scientific breakthroughs this is a field 
of cooperation that would be worthy of the soviet and american 
peoples and i will make that proposal to president reagan 
said gorbachev

the 30year prison sentence imposed on 
former marine sgt clayton j lonetree in a moscow embassy 
sexforsecrets case was cut by five years friday by the commander 
of the quantico marine base 
lt gen frank e petersen also lifted the 5000 fine imposed 
on lonetree after his aug 24 espionage conviction in a 
courtmartial at the northern virginia installation 
petersen acted after a review of lonetrees case because of 
his total cooperation and conduct during his voluntary posttrial 
debriefings by counterintelligence specialists 
gunnery sgt dean chamberlain said lonetree would be eligible 
for parole after serving onethird of his sentence which means he 
would have to spend 8 13 years instead of 10 years behind bars 
before being considered for release 
lonetree also was sentenced by the eightofficer courtmarital 
to a dishonorable discharge reduction to private and forfeiture of 
all pay and allowances those penalties were unaffected 
chamberlain said lonetree has been held at quantico since his 
trial 
lonetree was convicted on 13 counts including allegations that 
he turned over cia identities and floor plans of the us embassies 
in moscow and vienna to the soviets 
prosecutors alleged that lonetree became a spy after falling in 
love with a soviet translator violetta sanni 
his defense lawyers contended lonetree gave nothing of value to 
the soviets but was trying to string the kgb along by providing 
them with nonvital secrets in an effort to be a double agent 
lonetrees case unleashed concern over security at american 
embassies world wide and led to a secret presidential study that 
criticized the state department and the marines for neglecting 
security 
lontree who served as a guard at the moscow embassy in 1985 and 
1986 also was charged along with marine cpl arnold bracy with 
allowing kgb agents to roam the embassy at will those charges were 
dropped by the government for lack of evidence 
another member of the detachment sgt robert stufflebeam was 
convicted at quantico on minor counts of dereliction of duty 
the state department and the marines later minimized the 
security report that more than 500 instances of possible wrongdoing 
by guards at embassies worldwide had occurred 
in a statement the marines said many of the socalled 
infractions were minor such as curfew violations insubordination 
and misuse of telephone that could have no tie to espionage 
activities

the latest government figures on federal 
spending and tax receipts indicate chances of avoiding 
electionyear budget headaches are growing increasingly dim 
private analysts say 
sharply lower income tax receipts in april and continued 
increases in federal spending left the yeartodate budget deficit 
246 percent higher than in the same month of 1987 the treasury 
department said friday 
private analysts said the april report indicates the government 
will have a tough time avoiding a large jump in the deficit let 
alone achieving the reduction envisioned by the twoyear budget 
deal sealed by lawmakers and the president in december 
the government collected 139 billion more than it spent in 
april helping to hold the deficit for the first seven months of 
the 1988 fiscal year to 105 billion but that was more than 20 
billion higher than the 843 billion gap for the same period a 
year ago 
nevertheless the administration still is officially projecting 
that the tide of red ink will recede from 1502 billion in 1987 to 
1467 billion when the budget year ends sept 30

twenty years ago last month hair brought 
the age of aquarius to broadway and the american musical theater 
was never quite the same 
the show with its contemporary sound and freewheeling almost 
nonexistent book ran for more than 1700 performances spawning 
countless touring and foreign companies as well as a successful 
movie now it is back in new york for one night only this time in 
a unique concert version at the united nations that will be a 
benefit for children with aids 
the concert to be held may 26 at the un general assembly 
hall will reunite the musicals creators james rado jerome 
ragni and galt macdermot as well as many performers who appeared 
in various companies of hair or the film version 
the hair alumni include melba moore paul jabara heather 
macrae treat williams nell carter andre de shields and donna 
summer among the other performers scheduled to appear are bea 
arthur frank stallone jay leno rex smith and chuck mangione as 
well as a large cast of young unknown singers 
after 20 years the anniversary came up and we said what are 
we doing to do with it ragni said the other day people told 
us to do a big reunion of hair kids and make it just a hair 
celebration we didnt want to do that in a way hair was always 
used as a rallying point 
they found a new rallying point in the plight of children with 
aids and the money raised from the concert ticket prices are 
scaled from 250 to 5000 will go to the united states committee 
for unicef and the creo societys fund for children with aids 
hair was the most influential of the rock musicals that hit 
broadway and offbroadway during the late 1960s and early 70s 
more than any other rock show it integrated the pop music sound of 
the day into the broadway musical 
tim rice lyricist for such hairinspired musicals as 
jesus christ superstar and evita calls it one of the 
best broadway scores ever written 
hair was also one of the most popular it spawned four top 
four singles on the american pop record charts each was sung by a 
different artist incredibly one song got to the no 1 spot 
aquarius by the fifth dimension another to no 2 hair 
sung by the cowsills a third to no 3 good morning 
starshine by oliver and a fourth to no 4 easy to be hard 
by three dog night 
the musical first opened in new york offbroadway in october 
1967 at the new york shakespeare festival public theater the 
following april it was remounted recast and redirected and moved 
to broadways biltmore theater 
rado and ragni were in the cast rado played a young man named 
claude who was about to be drafted and spends his remaining free 
hours with a tribe of firstspirited individuals on the outskirts 
of conventional society 
when the show is done today and it still has revivals around 
the country its done as a period piece rado says 
theres nothing from that era that really showed what went on 
with the hippie movement what that time was about ragni said 
it touched on the antiwar movement racism the ecology movement 
and a lot of other things all this was going on at the same time 
the title of the concert is hair for the next 
generation and for the show the trio has composed 18 new songs 
including several with such titles as plant love ozone and 
sweet american that sound like they will fit right into the 
show twelve of the new numbers will be used in the concert as well 
as most of the original songs 
we thought what would hair be like now so we wrote 
those kinds of songs said ragni whats the difference between 
now and then 
the children of today are ready to embrace this show again its 
creators say and the concert may be the first step toward a new 
edition of the show that may play the west coast and work its way 
east 
there is such a revival of the 60s going on right now 
ragni said what was that era about a lot of them are asking 
these kids are wondering what their parents were like or what 
the kids in those days were like said rado this show still 
gives them a good idea

president reagan leaves this week for a summit 
in moscow that under a diplomatic code of reciprocity will be 
amazingly similar to soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs visit in 
washington late last year 
begin with their cars gorbachev shipped his zil limousine to 
washington instead of relying on his host for transportation so 
reagan will follow suit sending his armored cadillac to moscow 
gorbachev met in washington with american writers actors news 
executives and businessmen reagan will meet in moscow with monks 
dissidents students writers artists and filmmakers 
gorbachev gave an interview in moscow to nbc anchorman tom 
brokaw reagan sat down at the white house with moscow television 
correspondents valentin zorin and boris kalyagin for an interview 
that will be broadcast may 27 in the soviet union 
the two leaders gave dinners for each other in washington 
theyll do the same in moscow 
white house planners even counted the number of meetings the two 
leaders had in washington and checked the time they spent together 
that provided the basis for planning the moscow summit 
i would expect that the actual formal meeting times will 
closely reflect the meeting times here maybe a little bit more 
but not an awful lot said tom griscom the white house 
communications chief and a key architect of reagans trip 
you can blink your eye and see a difference here or there but 
it is set up so that there is a commonality to what were doing 
griscom said 
reagan will arrive in moscow on may 29 a sunday after a 
fournight stop in helsinki finland he will be the first american 
president in 14 years to visit the soviet capital 
officials in both countries say there is no chance the summit 
will produce a new arms treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons 
however they are expected to sign a variety of other agreements 
dealing with issues such as ocean pollution search and rescue 
missions at sea fishing and cultural programs 
moreover minor agreements on providing notice of missile tests 
and on nuclear testing also are expected to be ready for signature 
reagan will see gorbachev on sunday in st georges hall in the 
kremlin palace the first of five official summit meetings 
two rounds of talks are planned at the kremlin on monday 
another meeting is planned on tuesday and the fifth and final 
official session is set for wednesday after which time has been 
set aside for a signing ceremony 
in washington gorbachev held a news conference after the 
summit reagan is slated to meet with reporters june 1 the day 
before he leaves moscow for an overnight stop in london on his way 
back to washington 
there will be some small twists in the schedule in moscow 
for example gorbachev has invited the reagans to the bolshoi 
theater for a special ballet presentation wednesday evening 
followed by an intimate dinner at a country cottage outside moscow 
nothing like that occurred in washington 
moreover reagan will arrive on a sunday and depart on a 
thursday visiting with gorbachev formally or informally on each of 
the five days 
on his trip to washington last december gorbachev arrived on a 
monday but did not see reagan until tuesday they held three days 
of talks with the soviet leader departing on a thursday 
the planning for reagans trip actually started when the soviets 
were here last fall arranging gorbachevs visit in december 
what we tried to do was to recognize last year that whatever 
we did in washington would probably have an impact on what we were 
going to do in moscow and that reciprocity is very important 
griscom said 
and so in looking at this schedule coming up we used the 
washington summit schedule as the model to build from particularly 
for the official part of the schedule the number of meetings 
dinners and things like that 
unlike gorbachev who received his visitors at the soviet 
embassy reagan will go out to his audiences instead of bringing 
them to him 
the major speech of his trip will be delivered on may 31 before 
students at moscow university a question and answer session also 
is planned 
reagan also plans to visit a monastery on the outskirts of 
moscow to watch monks restore icons and to have lunch with 
writers artists and filmmakers at the house of writers 
reagan is known as the great communicator and griscom said 
part of his communication is not just the spoken word but where 
its delivered how its delivered i think the fact that this 
president will go to moscow university to speak to the students 
will have an impact on them 
i tend to think that they will appreciate that fact that he 
came to them that he was willing to take his time out to come to 
where they were rather than to lift them up and move them where he 
might be griscom said

the charging soybean futures market has attracted many new 
investors who are betting on a continuation of this springs dry 
weather to drive prices even higher 
but weather markets are risky and experts warn that a sudden 
shower could wash profits away 
where we try to be careful with our investors is to let them 
know just that that a weather scare can just as easily turn around 
with tomorrows forecast said penny wydominic a marketing vice 
president at merrill lynch pierce fenner amp smith inc in new york 
the combination of diminishing soybean stockpiles and unusually 
dry conditions during the spring planting period has pushed soybean 
futures prices to fouryear highs on the chicago board of trade 
amid mounting fears of tight supplies 
even though planting is only about half finished and despite 
the fact that growers in the south can safely delay planting of 
fastgrowing soybeans until early july trading of soybean futures 
has reached frenzied proportions at times during the past two weeks 
the wheat corn and oat markets have also been strong but the 
gains in soybeans have been dramatic 
prices have soared more than 25 percent since midmarch the 
contract for may delivery of soybeans expired thursday at 777 a 
bushel compared to 611 on april 16 soybean trading volume has 
nearly tripled 
the openinterest figures tell another part of the story 
soybean open interest the tally of outstanding orders and a rough 
indicator of the number of new players in the market has jumped 
about 30 percent since midmarch 
were getting phone calls from people whove never been 
involved with this stuff before looking to get in said walter 
spilka an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york 
i would say that what youre seeing first is people who 
speculate in other commodities moving easily into the grains 
spilka said then youre probably also seeing people who have 
been for instance in the stock market or the bond market who 
again are speculative by nature making more inquiries about the 
prospects for commodities and grains 
ms wydominic agreed what youre seeing is people looking for 
alternative places to earn a good rate of return 
people who have been involved in the stock market are looking 
for another good story she said the grains and soybeans have 
certainly presented a good story and its a relatively easy thing 
for investors to understand the weathers not good soybean 
supplies are short and it provides a good weather market 
opportunity 
the soaring prices and increasing talk of drought have longtime 
traders recalling previous soybean rallies including the one 15 
years ago in which soybean futures hit an alltime high of 1290 a 
bushel on june 5 1973 
but experienced observers also recalled that in a weather 
market the change can come as suddenly as a summer storm 
it has at times dropped faster than it went up said robert 
wisner iowa state university extension economist in ames iowa 
in times past we have seen bull markets like this end with as 
much as three days of limitdown moves 
for soybean futures in which prices are permitted to fluctuate 
no more than 30 cents a day that would translate into a loss of 90 
cents a bushel or 4500 per 5000bushel contract 
the person whos trading these markets needs to be well versed 
in charting techniques and indicators like the relative price 
index which shows the soybean market is overbought and due for a 
correction wisner said it could come down sharply in the 
event of rain 
wisner said investors attracted by the strong soybean market but 
looking to limit their exposure should consider options which 
allow players to set their maximum risk exposure in advance

the golden leaf of tobacco is offering little 
shade from the heat generated by us surgeon general c everett 
koops declaration that nicotine in cigarettes is addictive 
his report lumping nicotine with heroin and cocaine as 
physiologically addictive drugs underscored the seeming 
contradiction between the governments support of tobacco prices 
and its warnings about using the product 
but at the agriculture department where cafeteria patrons have 
nosmoking or smoking areas banthebutt crusades are viewed with 
a certain cynicism the attitude is that congress makes the laws 
and if congress wants the farm price of tobacco supported at 
minimum levels its usdas job to do it 
careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes 
and other forms of tobacco are addicting koop said last week in 
the surgeon generals annual report on smoking and health an 
extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in 
tobacco that causes addiction 
the usda has run federal price supports for tobacco since the 
early 1930s basically in return for going along with controls on 
plantings and marketings growers are assured a floor price on what 
they produce 
the antismoking campaigns have affected cigarette use although 
its hard to be precise about their impact says verner grise of 
the departments economic research service price increases by 
cigarette manufacturers and rising taxes have boosted retail costs 
sharply prompting some smokers to quit or cut down 
since 1981 total us cigarette consumption has dropped more 
than 10 percent and last year americans consumed 575 billion 
cigarettes or pieces the fewest since 1972 
grise said the decline in domestic cigarette use isnt over and 
the surgeon generals report last week will add to the downturn 
i dont know that well see any accelerated drop in 
consumption but certainly it the report will be a factor in the 
continued drop in consumption of onehalf to 2 percent a year 
grise said in an interview 
grise said he thinks that there will be a push for an 
additional warning label on cigarette packages to indicate 
nicotine is addictive and i suppose that a push for prohibition 
or restrictions on where minors can buy cigarettes is going to 
be stepped up he said 
more than 40 states and the district of columbia have laws that 
either ban smoking in certain places or segregate smokers from 
nonsmokers at least 10 states regulate smoking in workplaces 
the rate of smoking cigarettes by adults 18 years and older 
peaked at 4345 cigarettes a year more than 217 packs of 20 each 
in 1963 and has generally declined since then last years 
average was 3201 cigarattes or 160 packs the lowest since world 
war ii 
the figures are used statistically to compare yeartoyear 
changes and include both smokers and nonsmokers 
meanwhile us cigarette exports are up sharply a record 
1002 billion pieces last year a 56 percent jump from 1986 
with domestic use declining the export market grows in 
importance to the cigarette industry an additional boost could 
have been provided if a proposal by tobaccostate lawmakers had 
succeeded 
the senate agriculture committee at the urging of sen jesse 
helms rnc last year inserted in the trade bill a move to make 
tobacco exports eligible for export enhancement program subsidies 
with any resultant losses to be borne by the usdas commodity 
credit corp 
the panel acted without much fanfare and major debate did not 
come until the measure moved to the senate floor 
the senate last july 10 killed 5143 an attempt by sen john 
chafee rri to delete the plan from the bill 
chafee claimed the 39 million cost estimated by the 
congressional budget office represented a violation of the 1982 
nonetcost agreement governing the tobacco program 
sen wendell ford dky and other tobaccostate lawmakers 
retorted that the agreement was never supposed to have affected 
export programs and that in any case it was not a smoking issue but 
an economic one 
no similar measure however was contained in the house version 
of the legislation and when the trade bill went to a housesenate 
conference committee the tobacco provision was quietly dropped 
the 1982 nonetcost tobacco program act required that growers 
had to pay through assessments the costs of operating the federal 
support program to be eligible producers of most kinds of tobacco 
are required to go along with federal production controls 
in 1986 additional legislation changed the quotasetting 
procedure price support levels and the nonetcost assessments for 
fluecured and burley tobacco the main types produced by us 
growers the changes were aimed at making us tobacco more 
competitive in world markets and to bring supplies into balance 
with demands 
grise said the nonetcost law has worked and combined with the 
1986 changes has put the governments tobacco program on a much 
sounder basis 
except for 10 million to 15 million of administrative costs 
the tobacco program in recent years hasnt cost the taxpayer any 
money grise said 
even before the 1982 law tobacco support operations were 
relatively small compared with those for some other farm 
commodities that piled up huge crop surpluses and then cost a lot 
to dispose of he said 
according to usda in the 1986 fiscal year for example net 
outlays by the commodity credit corp were a record 258 billion 
of that tobacco support operations cost 253 million compared 
with 121 billion for feed grains 344 billion for wheat 234 
billion for dairy and 214 billion for cotton 
since then there have been no net outlays by ccc for tobacco 
according to department figures 
the tobacco industry says more than 700000 americans earn at 
least part of their incomes from tobacco and that retail sales of 
more than 30 billion a year generate 9 billion in federal and 
state tax revenues 
at the producer level grise says the 1982 census of agriculture 
showed about 179000 tobacco farms in the country but he says those 
probably have declined to fewer than 170000 in 1954 there were 
about 512000 
last years tobacco harvest came from 601700 acres in 16 
states total output was around 123 billion pounds with 65 
percent produced in north carolina and kentucky in all according 
to usda the 1987 crop had a farm value of 193 billion making 
tobacco the sixthranked us commodity in terms of value corn led 
at 121 billion

the continued buildup of inflation anxiety this 
past week has left many bond traders wondering if the federal 
reserve has wimped out on its interest rate policy 
fears have been mounting in recent weeks in financial markets 
that robust economic growth could ignite high inflation the 
tension has driven down bond prices and pushed up interest rates to 
their highest levels since last december 
many traders have been expecting the fed to nudge interest rates 
still higher in an effort to cool inflationary pressure but the 
central bank which did respond earlier this month is apparently 
reluctant to tighten credit any further for now 
the fed governors are resting on their monetary oars said 
william sullivan director of moneymarket research for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
some market observers much less flatteringly referred to the 
feds inaction as wimping out 
the fed is suffering from an extreme bout of 
electionyearitis said robert brusca chief economist and 
senior vice president of the fixedincome division of nikko 
securities co international inc he reflected the feeling in some 
quarters that the fed is buckling under pressure from the reagan 
administration not to raise interest rates since that could hurt 
the chances of republican presidential contender george bush 
the perception that the central bank is staying the course and 
not pushing rates higher helped bond prices recover thursday from a 
threeday selloff most observers believe that the feds 
policymaking arm its federal open market committee decided at a 
meeting last tuesday not to tighten rates 
traders said bond prices also were cushioned during the week by 
a flight to safety by investors fleeing the eroding stock 
market into the relative security of bonds or more liquid 
investments like moneymarket accounts among bonds the trend 
mainly helped shortterm issues such as threemonth treasury bills 
since they offer greater liquidity to jittery investors 
people are definitely leaning toward more marketable 
investments said jack baker the head of block stock trading at 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
the markets inflation anxiety was aggravated last tuesday when 
the commerce department reported that the nations trade deficit 
was sliced by more than 4 billion in march to 97 billion the 
lowest monthly shortfall since march 1985 
the seemingly positive trade report was taken as bad news by the 
stock and bond markets traders saw the big boom in exports in 
march as another sign the economy could be overheating dangerously 
fridays report that consumer prices rose a modest 04 percent 
in april a level that had been widely anticipated failed to 
dispel the markets inflation worries investors remained fearful 
that the economy is growing so quickly that inflation may 
eventually accelerate 
the yield on the treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped 
to 922 percent tuesday the day of the trade report from 911 
percent late monday the long bond traded friday at around 933 
percent its highest level since it hit 940 percent last dec 14 
the rate on threemonth treasury bills which apparently 
benefited strongly from the flight to safety out of wall 
street fell to 614 percent late thursday from 630 percent on 
tuesday but it moved up on friday to 642 percent

computers would be easier to use if the 
companies that make them would stop their bickering something that 
became clear this past week in a bitter battle over a 
simplification plan 
the fight over unix a base layer of computer software is 
reminiscent of the days when railroads laid tracks of different 
gauges and couldnt agree who should rip theirs up 
railroad museums have pictures showing that stevedores once had 
to lug freight between trains that couldnt run on the same tracks 
most railroads overcame their differences decades ago but 
computer makers are still at each others throats 
there are few pure hearts in the fight over computer standards 
which pits american telephone amp telegraph co and the upstart sun 
microsystems inc against international business machines corp 
digital equipment corp hewlettpackard co and four others 
customers are clamoring for unix the prize in this battle 
because it allows them to run the same programs on different kinds 
of computers 
as things are now its as if someone had to buy one kind of 
television to watch dallas and another kind to watch monday 
night football 
atampt made the telephone easy to use and says it can do the same 
for computers atampt invented unix and wants to continue controlling 
its development with suns help 
but by the end of the week some people were saying that atampt 
had miscalculated alienating not only its rivals but some 
customers as well 
william h anderson the computer chief for prudentialbache 
securities inc said atampt had performed a disservice to 
customers by altering unix to make it more dependent on a computer 
chip designed by its partner sun microsystems 
atampt denies it has doctored unix for its own purposes the 
company says unix is in good hands and questions the motives of 
some of its rivals which want to turn over development of unix to 
an open software foundation 
the foundation announced tuesday is backed by 90 million over 
its first three years its mission is to create a computing 
environment that would include a unified version of unix 
atampt is refusing to join the foundation and there is a 
possibility that unix will split in half just as it reaches the big 
leagues 
i think that atampt has not learned that it is no longer 
possible for a single company to control standards said marvin 
sirbu a computer standards expert at carnegiemellon university 
who takes the side of the open software foundation 
the stakes are high computer systems that primarily use unix 
are likely to make up 22 percent of a 120 billion world market by 
1991 up from 6 percent of an 87 billion world market in 1986 
international data corp estimates 
some atampt executives are hinting that ibm and digital might 
impede progress toward a unified unix for selfish reasons 
it is indisputable that computer makers such as ibm and digital 
benefit when they can lock customers into their own private 
operating systems that way they can charge more for products 
because there is less competition customers cant afford to switch 
to another supplier because they would have to junk all their 
existing equipment 
but like it or not ibm and digital are being pushed to support 
open operating systems such as unix because customers are demanding 
them 
prudentialbache is insisting on unix for many uses because it 
allows the company to choose computers with the best combination of 
price and performance without worrying that they wont be able to 
run the companys software anderson said 
anderson dismisses the theory that ibm and digital would try to 
fragment unix to keep customers using their own private operating 
systems ive listened to talk like that for the last 30 years 
he said 
other observers are more willing to attribute ulterior motives 
to ibm and digital but they say any impulses by those companies to 
undermine unix would be checked by hewlettpackard apollo computer 
inc and other members of the new foundation 
by thursday realizing it was losing ground in the 
publicrelations battle atampt said it was willing to cooperate with 
the foundation and might some day put unix development into a 
separate atampt group at arms length from the data systems division 
forty years after the first computers visionaries are still 
waiting for the day when word processing will be as easy as food 
processing and searching a data base will be as simple as thumbing 
through an encyclopedia 
standardizing on unix is a step in that direction as are 
setting standards for the ways computers hook up in networks and 
achieving some uniformity in the look and feel of computer 
software 
unfortunately each move toward standards seems to involve a 
fight apple computer inc for example is suing hewlettpackard 
for copyright infringement over the similar appearance of their 
software

a history of conflict between computer makers has left customers 
wondering whether their interests are being slighted 
peter marx a boston lawyer said he would try to build a united 
front of computer users to give customers more clout with groups 
such as the open software foundation 
some people in the industry preferred to declare a plague on 
both of the warring groups 
the polarized posturing of these companies cannot help the 
real headway that was being made towards openness in operating 
systems standards as such this is a great pity and a disregard of 
customers real interests fred wang president of wang 
laboratories inc said in a statement 
in other business and economic news this past week 
a record level of export sales reduced the us trade deficit 
in march to 97 billion lowest in three years the news although 
good depressed the stock market by reviving fears of increased 
inflation in reports for the month of april the government said

program trading a prime target of wall streets 
postcrash scapegoat searchers received two key defenses this past 
week one from federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and the 
other from the markets own behavior 
greenspans endorsement of the computerized trading strategy 
convinced one major brokerage to reconsider the voluntary ban it 
had placed on the most controversial form of program trading index 
arbitrage 
bear stearns amp co suspended index arbitrage earlier this month 
partly in response to a growing public outcry that the practice had 
injected volatility into the market devastating investor 
confidence and scaring away business 
salomon brothers inc morgan stanley amp co painewebber inc 
and kidder peabody amp co also suspended index arbitrage for their 
own accounts although they have said they would continue to use it 
for clients if asked 
in index arbitrage brokerages use computers to instantly sell 
big baskets of stocks in new york while simultaneously buying the 
equivalent stockindex futures in chicago or vice versa to profit 
from price discrepancies 
this strategy devised about five years ago has been credited 
with helping sustain the 198287 bull market that preceded the 
october collapse but some studies have suggested that index 
arbitrage also played a role in the wild price swings that 
accompanied the crash and the markets spasms since then 
testifying before congress greenspan argued that index 
arbitrage isnt the destructive influence critics claim but 
instead helps stabilize the market by keeping the prices of index 
futures and stocks from varying too widely 
it is a mistake to single out one segment of the broad 
marketplace as the culprit for large and rapid price movements 
said greenspan who is a member of a special presidential panel 
that has studied the causes of the crash the panel has recommended 
no major changes in any professional trading techniques 
some prominent critics of index arbitrage program trading were 
stunned by greenspans statement 
as much as i admire and respect mr greenspan i almost fell 
off my chair when i read that said robert kirby head of capital 
guardian trust co in los angeles which had threatened to boycott 
brokerages that use index arbitrage for their own accounts 
i just think computerdriven program trading is a disruptive 
influence kirby said he could be right and i could be wrong 
but i sure dont agree with him 
perhaps a more significant defense of index arbitrage than 
greenspans remarks was the markets action itself this past week 
although the biggest users of the technique were absent it did 
little to calm investor anxiety or bring back the disenchanted 
on the contrary many traders said another excuse was found to 
dump stocks fear of inflation and higher interest rates despite 
the best monthly trade news in three years the dow jones 
industrial average hit its lowest point in more than three months 
last wednesday closing at 195109 
the key index of 30 industrial stocks finished the week barely 
above that level at 195259 bringing its loss for the week to 
3795 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 2 to 14330 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market fell 
645 to 36603 and the american stock exchange market value index 
fell 610 to 29184 
volume on the big board averaged 15680 million shares a day vs 
15307 million the week before 
despite the thin volume and falling prices some trading 
strategists said they believed the absence of index arbitrage as a 
force in the market had caused a noticeable and welcome change 
for one thing they said fewer speculators were taking positions 
in advance of computerized buy or sell programs and investors were 
basing their decisions more on the longterm merits of stocks 
rather than quickprofit opportunities 
the market isnt as jerky said james cramer an outspoken 
critic of index arbitrage and president of a small investment firm 
that bears his name buyers come in because stocks are 
attractive were not seeing the shortterm hot money and fast 
traders

irving bank corp has amended it poison pill 
takeover defense to prevent hostile suitor bank of new york co 
from carrying out its threat to buy up irving stock and operate the 
bank as a subsidiary 
irving announced friday that in a special meeting its board of 
directors rejected bank of new yorks sweetened takeover bid the 
board refused to rescind its poison pill a condition under which 
bank of new york had proposed to slightly raise the stock portion 
of its 11 billion hostile offer 
instead irving said the directors amended the defensive 
provision so that it would be activated should someone acquire at 
least 20 percent of irving shares on the open market the poison 
pill previously would have gone into effect in the event of a 
takeover not supported by management 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said the action taken 
by irvings board is clearly invalid 
the company said it asked the new york state supreme court on 
friday to act quickly to invalidate irvings poison pill a hearing 
was set for may 24 
bank of new york had threatened to proceed with its orignal 
tender offer by tuesday and run irving separately provided at 
least twothirds of irvings 185 million outstanding shares were 
tendered 
irvings management meanwhile supports a friendly merger with 
banca commerciale italiana spa a major staterun italian 
institution 
a lot depends now on what the court rules said michael 
alpert a banking analyst with bear stearns if it the poison 
pill is ruled valid it will make it more difficult for the bank of 
new york to acquire irving unless theres a negotiated settlement 
poison pill defenses are designed to discourage takeover bids by 
greatly increasing the cost of an acquisition in irvings case 
existing shareholders would be permitted to buy stock in an 
acquiring company at about half price 
brady said that as of monday bank of new york held about 50 
percent of irvings stock including shares it owned or had been 
tendered to it 
also friday irving filed suit in us district court against 
the bank of new york alleging its unwanted suitor was in violation 
of federal securities laws by failing to notify shareholders of the 
financial ramfications of its amended offer it said bank of new 
york also failed to disclose the effects of its proposal to operate 
irving as a subsidiary 
bank of new york which holds a 49 percent stake in irving and 
had received conditional regulatory approval for an irving merger 
had offered to raise the stock portion of its bid to 1675 bank of 
new york shares from 1575 shares adding 320 per share to the 
deal and pushing its value to around 12 billion the 15 cash 
portion would remain the same 
the proposal came after irving announced a preliminary proxy 
count showed its shareholders reelected its board of directors 
rejecting a rival slate put forward by bank of new york the 
hostile suitor has since questioned the results and says it may 
file a formal challenge 
banca commerciale italys second largest bank is offering 75 
a share for 95 million irving shares or about 51 percent of the 
stock outstanding for a total of about 707 million the bid is 
part of a complex restructuring plan that would include asset 
sales costcutting measures and a 10ashare special cash 
dividend 
irving said in a statement friday that it was in active 
discussions with bci concerning improvement in its offer 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange irving 
closed down 375 cents friday to 6012 while bank of new york 
rose 25 cents to 3012

news that big increases in food energy and clothing costs sent 
consumer prices up 04 percent in april has gotten a gloomy 
reception from wall street and the bond market 
fridays government report of the april rise in inflation works 
out to an annual rate of increase of 53 percent 
inflation which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six 
years is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight 
labor markets high factory operating rates and a weak dollar 
analysts said 
stock and bond prices which had been weighed down through the 
week by fear of inflationary pressures and concern over higher 
interest rates finished the week with uninspiring performances 
the 04 percent inflation rise a level that had been widely 
anticipated nonetheless deepened the markets anxiety 
stocks ended mixed the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
closed with a 613 point decline at 195259 bringing its net loss 
for the week to 3795 broader market indices were little changed 
bond prices fell after an equally traumatic week driving 
interest rates higher the treasurys closely watched 30year bond 
declined point or 625 for every 1000 in face value the 
yield on the bond jumped from 927 percent late thursday to 934 
percent its highest level since it hit 940 percent last dec 14 
in another report friday the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation rose 09 
percent in april as the 04 percent rise in inflation was offset by 
increases in hourly pay and number of hours worked 
the april consumer price increase followed a 05 percent may 
advance which had been the sharpest monthly gain since january 
1987 analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two 
months is worrisome because it reflected price increases in a 
variety of areas 
in april grocery store prices shot up 08 percent the biggest 
increase in 20 months while gasoline costs which had fallen from 
september though february jumped 11 percent 
clothing costs which had surged a record 2 percent in march 
posted another 2 percent rise in april reflecting higher costs of 
imports 
we have an unacceptably high rate of inflation that is 
widespread said allen sinai chief economist of boston co 
this is the consequence of both the strength in the economy and 
the effect of the weaker dollar on imported goods prices 
seven months after the october stock market crash raised fears 
of a recession analysts have now switched to worrying that the 
economy is growing so strongly that inflationary pressures are 
building they cite the fact that factories are now operating at 
the highest level in eight years while unemployment has fallen to a 
14yearlow of 54 percent 
the federal reserve already has boosted interest rates twice in 
the past two months in an effort to dampen demand and head off 
further inflationary pressures 
but the tightening has done little to reassure financial 
markets which have been in a tailspin in recent days driven down 
not only by inflation concerns but fears that interest rates will 
go higher 
top reagan administration officials including treasury 
secretary james a baker iii have contended that the markets 
inflationary fears are overblown 
in a statement friday presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said inflation remains under control with no significant 
acceleration from recent years 
but private economists disagreed david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer predicted 
consumer prices would rise by 55 percent this year
