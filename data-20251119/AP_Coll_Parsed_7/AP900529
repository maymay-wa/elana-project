perhaps nowhere in europe will there 
be as much interest in this weeks summit meeting between george 
bush and mikhail gorbachev as in the two germanys east and west 
with 380000 soviet troops stationed in east germany and 250000 
us troops in west germany the two nations that are about to 
become one have the keenest interest in superpower negotiations to 
drastically reduce foreign forces stationed on their soil 
along with the troops some of the worlds deadliest weapons are 
kept on german soil hightech jet fighters nucleartipped 
shortrange rockets and thousands of atomic artillery shells 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said earlier this 
month that it was up to germans to decide the internal aspects 
of unification on troop levels baker said outsiders could become 
involved in the discussions but here too the germans were in 
charge of their future 
the troop negotiations being conducted in vienna austria by 
nato and the warsaw pact have been flagging and will be one of the 
prime topics when bush and gorbachev meet for four days in 
washington beginning thursday 
bush himself said last week that the talks havent gone as far 
or as fast as i would like to see maybe we can find some way 
at the summit or before the summit to move cfe the talks 
forward 
us officials have said they feel moscow is reluctant to 
conclude a conventional forces in europe treaty unless there are 
assurances that the large west germany army will not pose a threat 
after unification 
one us official who requested anonymity said recently that 
it would be difficult to complete a treaty this year because of the 
german issue and also because of soviet concerns about the 
steadfastness of the east european allies 
the day before bush spoke however soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze said after meeting with his west german 
counterpart hans dietrich genscher that moscow advocates an 
acceleration in the vienna negotiations 
west german officials were quoted in geneva where the two men 
met as saying the us perception of soviet hesitancy on the 
treaty might be a misunderstanding 
shevardnadze himself asked if could confirm the purported 
soviet position on the german military replied no 
in december the two superpowers agreed to slash their central 
european forces to 195000 each with the united states allowed to 
keep an additional 30000 troops in britain and southern europe 
there are now 305000 us troops and an estimated 565000 soviet 
troops in europe 
looking toward the summit capt stefan lang a spokesman for 
the west german defense ministry commented recently we hope 
important signals in the direction of arms controls come out of the 
summit but what exactly they will be we dont know 
no one is more eager for major superpower cutbacks than the 
germans 
west german chancellor helmut kohls government says it wants 
the eventual complete removal of soviet and us shortrange 
nuclear weapons from german soil 
we believe that the lance missile and nuclear artillery have 
lost most of their significance and therefore there should be 
thoughts about how these rockets can be negotiated away lang 
told the associated press 
he stressed however that the lance missiles should be removed 
only in negotiations because the soviets still have a huge 
superiority in this area this should occur in a balanced way 
an agreement to reduce conventional forces would open the way to 
negotiations on the superpowers nuclear arsenals in europe 
washington and the other nato allies have said they are ready 
for talks with the soviets on the shortrange nuclear weapons most 
of which are based in germany 
but nato has not taken a clear stand on negotiating the numbers 
of these weapons down to zero 
a feud could break out within nato if attempts are made to 
replace shortrange nuclear weapons in west germany with 
airlaunched rockets 
i am warning against a new atomic arms race new weapons are 
not needed genscher said recently 
the future of nato and of american troops in europe could 
become a bone of contention as well 
some west german politicians including genscher have warmed up 
to the soviets idea of creating new european security 
structures to take the place of nato and the warsaw pact 
but washington and other nato partners say they are vehemently 
against replacing nato 
the social democrats kohls main political rivals have also 
said nato and the warsaw pact should be transformed into a new 
europewide security arrangement 
the social democrats are pressing nato to make major changes 
that would better reflect the rapid waning of the oncemighty 
sovietled warsaw pact 
it would be very good if the americans prepared the way for 
this with constructive proposals during the summit horst 
ehmke disarmament expert for the social democrats said

on a windswept hill fragrant with 
prairie sage the daughter of a utah sheep rancher passed 
photographs of nuclear bomb blasts to the kazakhs crowded around 
her eyes widened 
we have seen such mushroom clouds from here too said a 
grizzled man in this central asia ranch town 
just like janet gordons hometown of cedar city utah karaul is 
125 miles downwind from the spot where the government routinely 
tests nuclear bombs underground 
mrs gordon 300 other foreign antinuclear activists and the 
people of karaul on sunday shared stories of death and disease they 
blame on radiation caused by the testing they were taking part in 
a fourday conference of antinuclear activists from 21 countries 
atmospheric testing was conducted by the americans and soviets 
until it was banned under a bilateral treaty in 1963 some 
radiation may have drifted across the border from aboveground 
testing in china until 1980 
my father died one kazakh in an embroidered moslem cap said 
to mrs gordon 
under the old mans banner which read we are nuclear 
victims too a young mother grasped her little boys shoulder 
my son was sick until he was four years old she said he 
could not walk without falling down 
i came to kazahkstan to meet people like you mrs gordon 
replied 
on the central asian steppe similar to areas of nevada near the 
us test zone activists traded fears research and political 
strategy with local residents who in just one year have been 
transformed from silent victims to successful protesters 
soviet activists formed the nevadasemipalatinsk antinuclear 
movement named for test sites in the two countries they exerted 
enough pressure that the soviet government has not conducted an 
underground nuclear blast at semipalatinsk since october 
soviet authorities have not agreed to a moratorium but the 
activists meeting apparently had toplevel approval since the 
zone next to the test range is normally closed to foreigners but 
police and security officials kept the group under tight control 
this is my brother mrs gordon 53 told the kazakhs 
crowded around her photographs he was watching our sheep when 
the cloud of radiation came over in 1954 he got burns on his arms 
and his hair fell out the sheep died his horse died 
four years later her teenage brother had cancer of the 
pancreas he died after four years mrs gordon said the kazakhs 
told stories of relatives crippled retarded or sickly 
in the 1950s historian amantai isin recalled his family lived 
in a village within the boundaries of the test site officials 
would take them away during a blast but bring them back home the 
same day no one ever suggested not drinking the milk from the 
family cows 
after one great blast in 1954 isins 5yearold brother came 
down with a terrible headache and died his father and another 
brother both died in their 30s he said isin is 39 
the activists traded grisly statistics 
mrs gordon said 13 of 17 children born in one year in the 1950s 
in cedar city utah had birth defects 
dr mayra zhangelova director of the semipalatinsk medical 
institute said birth defects per 10000 births in the soviet areas 
nearly tripled from 118 in 1980 to 292 in 1985 
foreign scientists in the group said the evidence of correlation 
to nuclear testing is strong but cannot be proved because of the 
time lag 
mrs gordon pulled out another photo showing a plume pouring 
from the earth in 1970 the kazakhs were shocked this was long 
after both the united states and the soviet union agreed to keep 
all blasts underground 
it was an accident she explained but accidents can 
happen 
we also fear this the crowd chimed in 
do you think there will be action on this at the summit 
asked one kazakh woman referring to wednesdays meeting between 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush in 
washington 
mrs gordon replied that a us ambassador had told her no 
she said she infuriated the official by calling for nuclear tests 
underneath the pentagon 
thats great beamed a kazakh woman reaching out to shake 
her hand

for some students of history the sense of deja vu 
is chilling weakening central power faces discontent among ethnic 
groups disgruntled workers and mutually suspicious intellectuals 
arrayed in myriad political parties 
a cumbersome and ideologyladen bureaucracy finds it easier to 
stick to its old ways than to reform 
with some vital differences mikhail s gorbachev in 1990 faces 
many of the same bewildering problems that caused the czarist 
empire to come crashing down around nicholas ii in the spring of 
1917 and the provisional government of alexander kerensky to fall 
to the bolsheviks that autumn 
for gorbachev the warning is sounded in the official press 
over tea at the kitchen table and in the congress of peoples 
deputies where 84yearold scholar dmitri likhachev warned against 
a nationwide presidential election 
i remember the revolution of february 1917 very well and i 
know where emotions can lead likhachev told parliament in march 
understand our conditions direct election of the president will 
lead to civil war 
writer andranik migranyan said in the weekly literaturnaya 
gazeta really you can come to despair from the thought that in 
this country everything repeats itself 
gorbachevs most stubborn problems are ethnic disputes and 
economic dislocation familiar problems for prerevolutionary 
leaders 
the fringe areas of the russian empire that escaped during the 
turmoil of the revolution only to be patiently gathered in again by 
stalin are asserting their independence lithuania latvia and 
estonia are leading the way 
the economy is in disarray industrial production fell 12 
percent in the first three months of 1990 strikes last summer by 
thousands of coal miners finally broke the long communist 
prohibition against job actions 
regardless of legality 130000 people were on strike on any 
given day in the first quarter of the year store shelves are empty 
and people are angry 
strike committees still are active in many cities at a recent 
meeting representatives of about 50 of them declared a lack of 
confidence in the governments ability to reform the economy 
just as the bolsheviks agitated for the overthrow of the czarist 
government and then kerenskys provisional government dozens of 
new political parties now are pressing to push the communists out 
of power 
the soviet leaders opponents hark back to 1917 to argue that 72 
years of communist rule has brought the country little but ruin 
in 1917 all power to the soviets was the slogan under which 
lenins legions took power in 1990 protesters march with the same 
banner demanding that the communist party bureaucracy turn power 
over to an elected parliament 
the goal of a new party must not be to work within the system 
but to break up the system nikolai travkin a former communist 
told supporters of his drive to form an anticommunist group 
repeating the experience of the past the new parties often 
cannot agree on their own program much less a common front russian 
social democrats meeting in moscow in early may spent much of their 
time debating whether local chapters would have to obey central 
authority 
such disputes paralyzed the russian political system before the 
bolshevik revolution and gave lenins highly disciplined minority 
the opening it needed to seize power 
but there are important differences between 1917 and 1990 
many historians argue that czarist russia despite its archaic 
political system could have been transformed peacefully if not for 
world war i which began in 1914 
the russian economy was expanding rapidly farm output was 
growing and expenditures for education were increasing 
the war exposed fatal weaknesses in political and economic 
administration which led not only to military losses but severe 
food shortages in the cities they argue 
gorbachev has resolutely avoided military conflicts he has 
pulled soviet soldiers out of afghanistan concluded arms control 
agreements with the west and started pulling soldiers out of 
eastern europe in order to spend more of the countrys resources on 
the domestic economy 
in contrast to nicholas ii and kerensky gorbachev is a 
consummate inside politician master of the system in which he has 
worked for more than 30 years 
he has patiently isolated and eliminated his communist party 
foes and stands alone now atop both the government and party 
apparatus 
nevertheless critics charge that he is dangerously late in 
making key reforms and that he does not fully understand the 
country he governs 
vyacheslav shostakovsky rector of moscows higher party school 
and a leading party reformer said gorbachev is isolated by the 
partys inability to give him a real understanding of what people 
are feeling 
his rare trips dont give him the emotional coloring 
shostakovsky said in an interview thats why he was shocked by 
the may 1 events when protesters marched past him in a may day 
parade and shouted their criticisms 
if gorbachev had understood the mood of the people he would 
have been able to anticipate the angry reaction shostakovsky said 
but gorbachev consistently has shown a strong streak of realism 
in february less than two months after rejecting the idea he 
led the party into accepting a multiparty system at the same time 
the party adopted the principle of private property and a new law 
going into effect on july 1 will allow soviet entrepreneurs to hire 
labor 
speaking to reporters last week at a moscow parliamentary 
session gorbachev indicated he sees in his reforms a comparison 
with lenin in the first years of soviet power 
take any sphere everywhere we are hindered by complexes he 
said people are saying chaos chaos collapse collapse when 
lenin watched a similar revolutionary process he said you know 
this chaos will crystallize a new form of life 
we remain committed to the choice made in october 1917 the 
socialist idea gorbachev told the communist party central 
committee in february but we are moving away from its dogmatic 
interpretation refusing to sacrifice the peoples real interests 
to rigid schemes 
in 1990 once again the communists opponents are split the 
19million member party is by far the largest and best organized 
force in the country it controls most media has experienced party 
workers and owns buildings and bank accounts 
but the communists face a split themselves conservatives 
forming a russian communist party declared in a manifesto published 
may 13 that during the time of perestroika the economic situation 
in the country has been so aggravated that the existence of 
socialism and the sovereignty of our government have been placed 
under threat 
shostakovsky said that unless gorbachev pushes the party to 
radically reform itself at its 28th congress this summer he and 
many other progressives will quit 
the partys dilemma is largely its own fault shostakovsky said 
in an interview with the newspaper soyuz despite the unpleasant 
analogy with 1917 the party acts as though times have not changed 
he said 
the communist party first and foremost has remained a 
semimilitary organization he said but outside the window 
its not 1917 any more

voters in the taxrevolt state are 
being asked to double gasoline taxes to keep highway traffic moving 
california voters face june 5 ballot topics ranging from 
mountain lion hunting to legislative ethics with the gas tax hike 
aimed at raising 185 billion topping the list 
proposition 111 would double the 9centsagallon tax on fuel 
over five years to finance the largest transportation investment in 
state history the 185 billion would pay for new highway and 
railway construction aimed at thwarting freeway gridlock 
a companion ballot measure sponsored by gov george deukmejian 
would authorize a 1 billion bond issue just for rail transit 
construction environmentalists are pressing a similar but more 
generous measure that would provide 199 billion 
also on the ballot 
a proposal to rewrite ethics guidelines for the legislature 
which has been rocked by a federal corruption probe critics call 
it a lawmakers pay raise in disguise 
a proposed mountain lion hunting ban pushed by 
environmentalists but criticized by opponents who say the 30 
million a year it would set aside for wildlife protection would 
divert money from more deserving programs 
a plan to alter state justice system guidelines that critics 
call an attack on abortion rights 
a pair of measures that would change how legislative district 
boundaries are drawn 
in all the seven bond measures on the california ballot total a 
record 5 billion in addition to the two rail transit bond issue 
proposals voters are being asked to approve bonds for lowincome 
housing public schools state universities and prisons and to 
make state and local government buildings earthquake safe 
the tax hike proposition 111 is backed by a bipartisan 
coalition of government business and labor interests who forged 
the plan to combat deepening transportation woes 
with less than two weeks before voting the tax hike backers 
internal polls showed a 7point lead compared with a 13point 
margin in an independent poll taken in early may according to 
published reports 
supporters say the gas tax increase is needed because road and 
rail construction have lagged in face of rising population drivers 
statewide waste more than 400000 hours a day because the average 
urban highway speed has fallen to about 20 mph during commute hours 
planners fear future growth could broaden daily gridlock in the 
next decade the number of licensed drivers is expected to rise 18 
percent 
strategists have been cheered by the lack of organized 
opposition but the measure asks voters to raise their own taxes in 
a state that revolted against taxes beginning with landmark 
property taxslashing proposition 13 in 1978 
proposition 11 is the measure that has been criticized by 
abortion rights activists supporters say it is aimed at limiting 
the rights of accused criminals to those stipulated by the 
constitution they say it would speed up prosecution and increase 
punishment powers 
but foes say the proposition would erode a womans right to 
abortion by eliminating privacy assurances in the state 
constitution 
the state supreme court has interpreted the state constitution 
to give defendants greater rights than those granted in federal 
courts 
proposition 117 would ban the sport hunting of mountain lions 
and create a new program funded with 30 million a year over the 
next three decades for buying and restoring wildlife areas 
some environmental groups say it is needed to protect wildlife 
and wouldnt increase taxes but opponents including hunters 
groups say the animals arent in danger and the bill would take 
money away from existing programs 
propositions 118 and 119 address reapportionment the boundary 
remapping is required by the state constitution every 10 years to 
balance populations among districts 
critics of the existing reapportionment system in which 
legislatureapproved plans are submitted for gubernatorial 
approval say it has allowed democrats to maintain their dominance 
democrats counter that the proposals would unfairly enhance 
republican interests 
proposition 118 would require that plans approved by the 
legislature be submitted to voters proposition 119 would require 
that redistricting plans approved by an independent citizens 
commission go before the electorate 
proposition 112 the ethics reform law would form a commission 
to set lawmakers salaries taking that task away from legislators 
the measure was prompted in large part by an fbi undercover 
corruption probe that led to the conviction and resignation of one 
senator a former senator remains under indictment 
supporters argue that it would reduce the influence of special 
interests but foes say the measure would make it easier for 
legislators to get a pay raise without voting on it 
propositions rounding out the ballot would give the governor 
more time to consider bills after legislative sessions would 
exempt the severely disabled from property tax increases when they 
move into a new home would change chiropractor licensing 
procedures and would expand instances in which the death penalty 
could be imposed for murder of peace officers

people caught by hurricane hugo last 
year might disagree but forecasters here say the deadly storm may 
have had a positive side effect it got the publics attention 
and one forecaster says hurricane seasons may be getting worse 
hugo which caused an unprecedented 10 billion in damage 
killed 28 people in the lesser antilles islands and an additional 
29 in south carolina 
but it would have been much more deadly if it had hit almost 
anywhere else says bob sheets director of the national hurricane 
center 
at the advent of the atlantic hurricane season which runs from 
june 1 to nov 30 sheets and other hurricane experts are using 
hugos example to get the attention of complacent coastal residents 
whove never experienced such fury 
well take advantage of the fact that there was a hugo last 
year and raise peoples awareness said sheets the 
consequences of not being prepared are too great 
early warnings about hugo last september allowed 350000 people 
to evacuate safely and in south carolina the worst of the 
hurricane struck the francis marion national forest between 
charleston and myrtle beach sheets said 
it heavily damaged the fishing village of mcclellanville and 
several small rural communities but the population there is sparse 
if hugo had struck a major coastal population center the 
destruction would have been greater than most americans have ever 
seen according to computer simulations known as slosh models for 
sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes 
with slosh forecasters can predict the height of the storm 
surge the mass of water piled up by the storm that is a 
hurricanes most destructive component anywhere along the us 
coast by punching in a storms speed size and intensity sheets 
said 
the population density in south carolina is a lot different 
from the florida coast new jersey or galveston texas sheets 
said compare that situation to the miamithroughpalm beach area 
all of dade broward and palm beach counties would have been 
destroyed 
hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern us 
coast since betsy hit the florida keys in 1965 killing 74 before 
it went on to missisippi and louisiana since then the population 
of areas such as south florida has ballooned and most residents 
have never directly experienced a hurricane 
according to one of the nations leading hurricane experts hugo 
may have been the first in a new era of killer storms 
no one knows for sure but the odds are florida and the east 
coast are going to get it william gray professor of atmospheric 
science at colorado state university told a national conference of 
weather experts this month 
gray came to this conclusion after his usually accurate 
predictions for hurricane activity were off the mark last year he 
had figured the 1989 season would be relatively mild with only 
four hurricanes instead seven hurricanes and four tropical storms 
killed a total of 84 people 
he blew it pretty bad sheets said but then he looked at 
the rainfall over africa and found an amazing correlation between 
rainfall there and hurricane activity over florida 
gray realized the 30year drought in africas sahel region 
corresponds almost exactly to the years when no major hurricanes 
have struck the southeastern coast 
whether one causes the other is uncertain they both may 
reflect largerscale events but the sahel is now getting up to 
nearnormal rainfall sheets said 
gray plans to release his predictions for 1990 on june 5 
tropical storms have been recorded in the atlantic in every 
month except april but are rare outside the june 1 to nov 30 
season last week a preseason tropical depression brought heavy 
rain to cuba 
a tropical depression becomes a tropical storm and is given a 
name if its sustained winds reach 39 mph it becomes a hurricane if 
winds reach 74 mph 
the names for atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms this year 
are arthur bertha cesar diana edouard fran gustav hortense 
isidore josephine klaus lili marco nana omar paloma rene 
sally teddy vicky and wilfred

the start of the atlantic hurricane 
season this week is a time of anxiety for many victims of last 
years hurricane hugo 
a lot of people are just barely back on their feet if they 
are at all and the thought that something like this could happen 
again is just frightening to them said veronique aniel a 
counselor with the statewide hurricane hugo outreach program 
the hurricane season begins friday and runs through nov 30 
hurricane hugo smashed ashore last sept 21 with 135 mph wind 
and a 19foot storm surge that caused an estimated 59 billion 
damage and killed 29 people in south carolina while most 
structures in charleston have been cleaned and repaired recovery 
in outlying areas has taken longer 
officials of the state department of mental health which 
operates the outreach program say as many as 20000 south 
carolinians suffering posttraumatic stress syndrome are expected 
to develop longterm psychological problems as a result of the 
storm 
were anticipating stress because of the anniversary coming up 
and because of the hurricane season starting said linda lane a 
counselor in berkeley county one of the outlying areas hardhit by 
the storm 
we have children who are having difficulty in school when the 
rain or wind is blowing more than normal she said 
some people will experience fear when the weather is similar to 
those before the storm said dr michael foxworth a psychiatrist 
who is medical director at charter hospital of charleston 
i think the emotional damage a person suffered in hugo 
probably relates primarily to the duration of time their lives 
were totally out of their control he said 
the person who had time to evacuate and get to a safe place 
and then pretty quickly returned to their normal environment 
suffered less psychological impact than those who were totally 
without resources he said 
foxworth said people will be watching weather reports and 
tracking hurricanes more closely this year 
before hugo there was a sense of denial about hurricanes a 
feeling that it cant happen here he said 
now that it has things swing the other way and it becomes a 
sense of expectancy that it will happen again even though the 
odds are probably no greater this year than before hugo he said 
some people say they will leave charleston and never return if 
another storm hits ms aniel said others deny another storm could 
even happen 
some people dont even want to talk about it they want to 
ignore the fact if another one comes this way what will these 
people do she said 
but the fact charleston has recently been hit by a storm would 
make a future evacuation easier 
youve experienced a bad hurricane and its fresh in peoples 
minds said mark zimmer of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla there wont be any difficulty convincing people its 
a real threat

west berlin plans to require visiting 
poles to obtain visas in an attempt to curb the citys burgeoning 
black market a spokesman for the federal government says 
roland bachmaier an interior ministry spokesman said monday 
that the western allies the west berlin government and the west 
german government have been discussing the idea but no date has 
been set 
on sunday the west berlin morgenpost newspaper said the 
requirement would take effect july 1 and also apply to other 
eastern europeans 
the paper said west berlin authorities were concerned about the 
growing black market in the city for which they blame visitors 
from poland and other east european countries 
a large west berlin supermarket chain last week started 
restricting sales to poles limiting the amount of goods they can 
buy in each store 
about 120000 poles flock to west berlin every week authorities 
say many seeking jobs and trade on the black market 
berliner morgenpost said poles and other eastern europeans 
wishing to stay in west berlin longer than one month would have to 
give convincing reasons for their stay and prove they have 
enough money to fund their visit

he is at 59 the oldest astronaut 
to ever fly in space and thats too old he says to get back in 
line and wait hope for one more flight 
as a result vance brand expects the upcoming mission aboard 
shuttle columbia to be his last journey into space 
brand will command the sevenman crew four of whose members are 
astronomers and will operate a 150 million observatory called 
astro liftoff is scheduled for 1238 am edt wednesday 
ill probably move on to a management job a second career if 
you will at this late date but frankly there isnt anything that 
beats flying in space brand said in a recent interview 
being an astronaut is a great job i suppose a lot of people 
would do it until they were 90 years old if they could but at the 
same time why ive had a lot of enjoyment out of being an 
astronaut and ive had four flights so i guess ill maybe look at 
some other work 
the trim silverhaired brand was chosen as an astronaut in 1966 
after serving in the marines as a naval aviator and later working 
as a test pilot 
brand made his first spaceflight in 1975 on the apollosoyuz 
mission in which the crews of the american and soviet spacecraft 
docked in space he was commander of the first fully operational 
flight of the shuttle system in 1982 and returned to space as a 
crew commander in 1984 
his decision to make this flight his last is a matter of 
practicality 
the big thing is it would be too long to stand in line to get 
the next flight he said 
nasa has 86 active astronauts two of whom are older than brand 
but have not flown for five or more years and are involved in 
management john young 59 and william thornton 61 a class of 
23 will be added to the rolls this summer 
the oldest astronaut to fly prior to brand was karl henize who 
was 58 when he flew in 1985 aboard challenger he is now a senior 
scientist at johnson space center in houston 
there is no mandatory retirement age for astronauts the average 
age is 41 
its about like any other job it depends on the persons 
capabilities brand said 
for about a year brand served as systems project manager for 
the proposed space station freedom at johnson space center he 
stepped down last fall to devote all his time to the shuttle 
mission 
that may be one of his roles within the national aeronautics and 
space administration once columbia returns to earth he said 
there are a lot of challenges in management brand said 
so its just that ill have to put one switch off and put another 
one on

pro football veteran phil mcconkey compares 
himself to the new presidents of czechoslovakia and nicaragua in 
sizing up his chances of being elected to congress 
neither czechoslovakias vaclav havel nor nicaraguas violeta 
barrios de chamorro had prior elected experience says the gop 
candidate from new jersey 
these people have what it takes to lead their people to better 
times he says political experience has nothing to do with 
it 
mcconkey who describes himself as a skinny street kid from 
buffalo is running an outsiders race against two veteran 
republicans for the chance to face democrat marguerite chandler in 
november they are vying for the house seat being vacated by 
republican rep jim courter who is retiring 
ive got energy to burn i cant be outworked or outhustled by 
anybody mcconkey says 
mcconkey 33 began his national football league career as a 
wide receiver with the new york giants who he helped to a 1986 
super bowl victory he most recently was with the san diego 
chargers but has not signed a contract for 1990 
he models himself after housing secretary jack kemp the onetime 
buffalo bills quarterback and former new york congressman and puts 
forth a combination of energy fiscal conservatism and patriotism 
although kemp has made no endorsement in the gop primary he 
says he has offered a helping hand to encourage mcconkeys 
nonewtaxes righttolife bid 
polls show mcconkey trailing state assemblyman rodney 
frelinghuysen and state sen richard a zimmer in the gop primary 
but richard roper director of the council on new jersey affairs 
at the woodrow wilson school in princeton nj said its possible 
mcconkey could win if the other two candidates split the moderate 
gop vote 
rutgers university political scientist steve salmore was more 
pessimistic about mcconkeys chances noting that few issues 
distinguish the three candidates other than abortion where 
frelinghuysen and zimmer are prochoice 
mcconkey however is his own cheering squad 
im always the underdog and up against insurmountable odds 
he said as an example of his determination mcconkey cites his 
decision to return to football at age 27 after five years as a navy 
helicopter pilot 
mcconkey a 1979 graduate of the naval academy proceeds 
undaunted against frelinghuysen whose father once held courters 
house seat and zimmer whose state legislative district dominates 
the congressional district 
pressure is landing a 10ton helicopter on the back of a 
rolling pitching deck at night or standing under a punt in front 
of 80000 people in the stands and millions on tv with 11 maniacs 
foaming at the mouth ready to decapitate you he said 
mcconkey who has put 40000 of his own money into the 
campaign has postponed his planned june wedding and is focusing 
solely on the upcoming primary 
my life goes from here to june 5 if you start worrying about 
things that arent in line with your goal its taking away from 
your energy and enthusiasm he said 
mcconkey talks about attracting minorities to the party 
although roper describes the congressional districts voters as 
overwhelmingly white moderate to middleincome republicans 
its an issue of bringing the party back to a lincoln party a 
party of the people mcconkey said he echoes the politics of 
inclusion philosophy of kemp and former new jersey gop gov 
thomas h kean 
mcconkey wont discuss plans for his pro football career except 
to say retirement from the chargers has been on his mind 
football is an avocation not a vocation he said 
his campaign has relied heavily on radio and cable television 
advertising as well as oldfashioned community campaign 
appearances he also involves sports colleagues including former 
nfl teammates lawrence taylor phil simms and mark bavaro 
former new york knicks guard earl the pearl monroe joined 
former washington redskins quarterback joe theismann in cohosting 
mcconkeys only washington fundraiser a 150aperson cocktail 
party last week 
besides his political and athletic pursuits mcconkey also has 
several business ventures pending he is partowner of mcconkeys 
restaurant in his home town of flemington and also is developing a 
shopping center and awaiting a patent on an electronics timekeeping 
device for sporting events

the united states and the soviet union enter 
this weeks summit with renewed momentum toward clinching a treaty 
that for the first time would require each side to reduce the 
number of longrange nuclear weapons 
while a treaty wont be ready for formal agreement when 
president bush begins four days of meetings with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev on thursday the two men are expected to issue 
a joint statement this weekend declaring the main provisions of the 
pact to be settled the details on the other hand could be months 
away 
bush and gorbachev are expected to agree to drastically reduce 
their stockpiles of chemical weapons and to end production of those 
weapons in addition they are expected to call for ratification of 
two existing pacts limiting nuclear tests us and soviet 
officials met during the weekend in an effort to settle arms 
control issues 
the administration has said bush also will press gorbachev for a 
commitment to speed up natowarsaw pact negotiations to reduce 
tanks troops and other conventional armaments in europe progress 
in these talks has slowed recently 
these will be the main arms control features of the summit 
which comes almost exactly eight years after us and soviet 
negotiators met in geneva to begin the strategic arms reduction 
talks 
yet to be settled before a start treaty can be formally signed 
are anticheating provisions and the question of whether to limit 
mobile landbased missiles such as the soviet ss24 and the 
proposed american midgetman plus a number of other relatively 
minor points of disagreement 
aides to bush and gorbachev are set to work throughout the 
summit on disputed start issues and negotiating teams in geneva 
plan to press ahead this summer in hopes of pulling the final 
pieces together in time for a yearend summit signing ceremony 
analysts say the chances of success are high 
bush and gorbachev are expected to announce an agreement 
probably not in the form of a treaty to destroy all but 5000 tons 
of each sides chemical weapons arsenal this would be intended as 
a catalyst for concluding a global ban on chemical arms in the 
conference on disarmament in geneva terms for ensuring compliance 
with the ussoviet deal have yet to be settled 
the summit also is to declare the two sides agreement on a 
ussoviet protocol for verifying compliance with 1974 and 1976 
treaties that limit the size of underground nuclear tests bush and 
gorbachev are expected to say the agreement will permit both sides 
to push for legislative ratification of the treaties 
the proposed start treaty if completed and ratified would 
represent an important step in disarmament it would require about 
a onethird reduction in numbers of longrange nuclear weapons and 
also may lead to followup negotiations to cut strategic nuclear 
forces even further 
previous treaties on strategic arms including the unratified 
1979 salt ii accord limited the growth of longrange weaponry but 
did not actually reduce their numbers 
the proposed new treaty would reduce the combined us and 
soviet strategic nuclear warhead totals from about 23500 now to 
about 16000 by the late 1990s 
start makes good sense for the united states secretary of 
state james a baker iii told reporters last week in defending the 
administrations negotiating record 
yet the proposed accord is being attacked by critics at both 
ends of the us political spectrum conservatives say it concedes 
too much to the soviets while liberals say it doesnt go far enough 
in forcing a shift away from nuclear confrontation 
baker has come under heavy attack for dropping a longstanding 
us demand that the start treaty prohibit all soviet upgrading of 
its ss18 landbased intercontinental ballistic missile the 
backbone of the soviet strategic arsenal 
its a travesty said frank j gaffney jr director of the 
center for security policy a washington think tank he contends 
that ss18 qualitative improvements that may be permitted under 
start would offset the effects of moscows agreement to reduce the 
number of ss18s by 50 percent over a sevenyear period 
the treaty as now drafted would not require such drastic 
reductions in any element of the us strategic arsenal the 
proposed cut in us ballistic missiles would be about 35 percent 
while the total number of warheads for strategic forces including 
bombers and seabased weapons would be 25 percent according to 
stan norris of the private natural resources defense council 
norris sees only limited value in the treaty he argues that it 
would merely codify arms cuts that both superpowers were planning 
anyway because of budget pressures and aging systems 
as with many past treaties this will be arms control without 
pain or sacrifice he said 
the actual size of the reductions is difficult to calculate 
because no one is sure what political and financial forces will 
bear on each countrys military between now and the end of the 
treatys proposed sevenyear implementation period its unclear 
for example how many more of the new b2 stealth bombers the 
pentagon will buy at the going rate of 815 million each 
jack mendelsohn deputy director of the private arms control 
association and a former member of the us delegation to the salt 
ii and start negotiations calculates that the cut in american 
strategic nuclear warheads may be as little as 6 percent he 
figures the soviet reduction may be less than 15 percent

its a con artists dream after years of 
learning to lock doors and install burglar alarms americans are 
being told its their patriotic duty to open their homes to 
strangers 
its the us census 1990 and some swindlers are taking 
advantage 
an 80yearold north carolina woman was tied up and robbed by 
two men she thought were census workers 
people claiming to be census employees charged houston 
residents 50 after helping them complete their forms 
census officials say such scams have to be expected 
when you do something this massive theres someone who will 
figure an angle to get money from it said noe balli of the 
census regional office in dallas he warned anybody who wants 
money theyre obviously not census employees 
there are 200000 to 230000 official census enumerators combing 
the countryside knocking on doors of those who failed to complete 
the form sent out this spring according to mark mangold of census 
headquarters 
each worker is armed with a red white and blue badge 
identifying the holder by name and id number as a us census 
enumerator in addition each worker carries a large black 
satchel with a red white and blue patch that says us census 
1990 said ray bancroft of the census promotion office 
to keep from becoming the victim of an imposter people should 
demand to see identification and if they have questions they 
should call the local census office for verification or call the 
police before allowing the person inside their home census 
officials said bancroft noted that impersonating a census worker 
carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a 1000 
fine 
there have been isolated incidents of con artists during every 
census bancroft said and this year is no different however fbi 
spokeswoman kelley cibulas said there is no reason for panic 
because the impostors have been few in number 
but some people have not been wary enough 
in the north carolina case the woman initially allowed only one 
man into her home and was having a nice conversation with him 
when the doorbell rang and the man told her it was his partner 
said tom smith jr of the charlotte nc office 
they tied her up and commenced taking some valuable things 
from the house as well as her car smith said they tied her 
hands and feet and she sat on the couch and watched them take the 
things she was not injured he said 
in houston people identifying themselves as census workers went 
to homes and helped the occupants complete the questionnaires then 
they charged them 50 for the help balli said the socalled 
census workers didnt even have copies of the questionnaire but 
used those sent to the residents he said 
another houston resident complained meanwhile that someone 
identifying himself as a census worker telephoned seeking credit 
information and credit card numbers balli said 
in colorado a woman identifying herself as a census worker 
asked an elderly woman resident for money the request was refused 
and the elderly woman called officials said ron ritschard of the 
denver census office there were no other reports of similar 
incidents he said 
nevada residents complained about a mailing that said official 
census form on the envelope but actually was sent by a clothing 
manufacturer said bob clingman of the regional census office in 
seattle 
there are some innocuous questions and they say if you send 
it in on time you can get a special price on two pairs of our new 
jeans for only 2995 clingman said the case was not pursued 
because the manufacturers name was included on the mailing 
envelope he said 
not everything that appears to be a scam is a scam noted bj 
welborn of the regional census office in boston 
for example people shouldnt necessarily be suspicious if a 
person identifying himself as a census worker seeks someones 
social security number she said while the census under way this 
year does not require the number it is needed for some surveys 
being conducted by the census bureau 
however welborn warned people to be alert if the person asks 
for bank account numbers as no census survey seeks such 
information 
sometimes its the census workers who are victimized officials 
said 
about two months ago a fearful homeowner shot an enumerator 
who survived said balli of texas 
the assailant was an elderly gentleman in mississippi who had 
been vandalized so many times and he saw this fellow on his 
property balli said 
the tires of one census workers car were slashed in northern 
new jersey said stephanie lowe of the bureaus philadelphia office

an auto accident victim died on the operating 
table after sheets covering her caught fire and filled the room 
with smoke officials say 
an autopsy was ordered to determine whether angela hernandez 
26 died of her accident injuries or was killed by the blaze monday 
at ucla medical cener 
engineers checked oxygen lines electrical circuits and other 
equipment for the cause of the fire said rich elbaum a medical 
center spokesman 
no other injuries were reported but the smoke forced the 
closing of all 16 operating rooms for the day so they could be 
sterilized 
ms hernandez had been in critical condition with heart and 
liver injuries after being crushed in an accident late sunday in 
santa monica police said 
she apparently was trying to warn motorists of her disabled car 
when another car struck her vehicle which in turn hit ms 
hernandez police said 
surgeons had finished operating on the los angeles woman and 
were about to take her out of the room on a gurney when the sheets 
and blankets ignited said fire department spokesman pat marke 
staff members tried to put out the fire but were forced out of 
the room by smoke said campus spokeswoman vicki beck by the time 
firefighters arrived some five minutes later the blaze had mostly 
burned itself out marek said 
the fire wasnt even hot enough to set off the sprinklers in 
the ceiling said battalion chief chuck merriman he estimated 
damage at 40000 
in 1988 a 15dayold boy was fatally burned at cedarssinai 
medical center when the spark from a cauterizer a penlike 
instrument used to stop bleeding from an incision ignited the 
highoxygen atmosphere in the room 
ucla medical center officials declined to say whether doctors 
monday had been using a cauterizer 
in february a man described as a disgruntled hospital worker 
walked into a office at the medical center and fatally shot a

agriculture department forecasters are 
projecting an increasingly narrow gap between wheat and corn prices 
that they say could mean a shrinkage of as much as 3 million tons 
in us corn exports over the year ahead 
that is because feedquality wheat priced at increasingly 
competitive levels is likely to take over some sales from corn 
the united states the european community eastern europe korea 
and the soviet union are all expected to use more wheat for feed 
raising the total to 105 million tons worldwide the department 
says 
usdas foreign agriculture service is thus forecasting the 
volume of us corn exports in the 199091 trade year down 3 
million tons from the current level the department has been 
estimating corn exports in the current year at 55 million tons 
lower wheat prices also are likely to send some countries into 
the market to look for additional wheat notably the soviet union 
and south korea the department said 
the main reason for the projected lowering of wheat prices is a 
sizeable crop in sight for next year estimated by usda recently at 
almost 27 billion bushels plus beginning stocks of 442 million 
bushels 
a recent usda report saw farm prices for wheat falling from a 
current 371 a bushel to the range of 290 to 330 a bushel 
corn prices were projected to be in the range of 225 to 265 
a bushel

red meat and poultry production this year may 
rise about 2 percent over 1989 according to agriculture department 
economists 
usdas latest livestock and poultry situation and outlook report 
says however that poultry meat is expected to be up about 7 
percent while red meat production is more likely to drop 1 percent 
from last year 
it said returns would be positive for broilers and eggs near 
the breakeven point for turkey producers and favorable for pork 
producers 
the report said that corn prices may rise from recent levels of 
230 to 240 a bushel even with a projected 1990 crop of 81 
billion bushels 
the price of corn is crucial for livestock and poultry producers 
because it is a prime source of feed 
usda forecasters say broiler production could increase 7 percent 
this year reflecting a healthy market over the last three years 
turkey production also could climb in the 7 percent range the 
department said 
total egg production was forecast up 1 percent 
but usda economists said commercial pork production is expected 
to be done about 2 percent this year because of poor returns in 
1989 they said beef production may rise slightly

usda researchers expect to introduce 30 new 
varieties of landscape plants over the next three years including 
a hybrid elm variety designed to be resistant to dutch elm disease 
these hybrids could mean that american elms reappear on the 
scene says geneticist alden m townsend of usdas national 
arboretum 
the arboretum splashed with color much of the year and spread 
across 444 acres in the nations capital is a world center for 
developing trees shrubs grass and other ground covers 
it has introduced 150 varieties of landscape plants since it was 
established by congress 63 years ago according to an article in 
the may issue of usdas agricultural research magazine 
arboretum researchers have fanned out across the world in quest 
of uncataloged varieties with financing help from the friends of 
the national arboretum a private group staffers have visited 
china korea the british isles and other farflung spots 
the arboretum provides magnificent spectacles an array of 
colorwashed gardens and a great meadow where visitors can see 
standing against the sky like ancient grecian ruins 24 white 
sandstone corinthian columns that once graced the east portico of 
the capitol 
replaced with marble columns three decades ago the huge columns 
were rescued by friends of the national arboretum from the muddy 
banks of the anacostia river where they had been deposited in 1973 
but the most important task at the arboretum may be breeding new 
plants among its most impressive contributions have been three 
ornamental pear trees 
former director john creech first spotted the bradford pear 
marked by snowy blossoms and a resistance to fire blight disease 
in the arboretums glenn dale md nursery 
a seed collected in china in 1917 by usda plant hunter frank 
meyer had produced the tree which had grown largely unnoticed 
over the last 30 years millions of bradford pears have been 
planted across the country including two placed in front of the 
white house by lady bird johnson in 1966 
when bradford pears proved too tall to be practical on some city 
streets the arboretum developed more compact varieties the

it was in the 10th grade that the unusually 
outspoken student was sent to the principals office for arguing 
about government with his teacher 
even today mikhail s gorbachev remembers the incident that 
underscored for him the need for free thought and expression he 
told the story with relish to two american educators who visited 
him at the kremlin shortly after he became president of the soviet 
union in 1989 
we agreed that the most important thing is to teach students 
to think said mary v bicouvaris a government and international 
relations teacher from hampton va and the 1989 teacher of the 
year 
students need more than just information and facts we agreed 
he gorbachev said that every time he meets american students he 
is impressed with their spontaneity ms bicouvaris said 
ms bicouvaris and darlene pierce director of the american 
association of school administrators national superintendent of 
the year program had been invited to the soviet union by a weekly 
newspaper owned by the communist party and circulated to teachers 
throughout the soviet union 
the 13day trip included visits to creative schools where an 
interchange of ideas between teachers and students is allowed and 
to the more typical schools where teacher lectures are the rule 
it was amazing to understand the similarities in our problems 
low esteem for teachers low salaries for teachers problems 
getting people to enter the teaching profession ms pierce said 
ms bicouvaris added a lot of the schools are in crisis they 
have problems with students not studying and just watching 
television and students being materialistic 
the soviet curriculum which runs through the 11th grade has 16 
required courses they are algebra geometry physics physical 
education army training english english literature computer 
literacy although there are virtually no computers in the schools 
interpreting russian literature chemistry history biology 
geography ethics and family life and psychology 
the newspaper uchitelskaya gazeta initiated its own teacher of 
the year program last year and sought advice on expanding it 
officials pressed for a meeting between gorbachev and the two 
americans to give their program credence 
gorbachev who ms bicouvaris said talked quietly with a 
wonderful voice like a southerner told of how he was sent to 
the principals office for arguing an idea 
he would lean back in his chair as if he had nothing to do 
said ms bicouvaris he talked about his feelings about teachers 
he thinks that teachers are important in making changes in the 
soviet unions education system 
he clearly feels that the soviet system needs to do some 
changing added ms pierce

kay fishburn gets some snickers when she 
asks people to donate money to erase the national debt now at 
more than 3 trillion but she claims to have collected nearly 11 
million 
were people of modest means but were getting a phenomenal 
response for the effort we put forward said mrs fishburn 50 a 
suburban milwaukee housewife who formed citizens for a debtfree 
america in 1983 
mrs fishburn is under no illusions about how much her group can 
accomplish not when the national debt is growing by about 20 
million every 34 minutes but she said were planting an idea 
paying the debt is a matter of honor she said 
the looseknit group has enlisted 600 volunteers nationwide the 
donations which last week neared 11 million have been forwarded 
to the us treasury 
donations included 1 million from former president reagan 
under whose administration the national debt more than tripled 
excess funds were donated from his 1985 inauguration committee 
the groups volunteers send out 10000 invitations annually to 
addresses taken from telephone books club rosters and whos 
who they receive 800 to 900 gifts each year from housewives to 
business leaders 
the invitation reads you are invited to participate in a 
historic endeavor to honor our predecessors to restore a legacy 
of liberty and initiative for future generations citizens of the 
united states of america have begun to voluntarily retire the 
public debt of the federal government 
thats the one thing we didnt anticipate was the degree of 
ridicule we would face mrs fishburn said people say 
theyll spend it faster than well send it in its the pervasive 
cynicism we call it the snicker factor we ignore the skeptics 
were going for the others 
those include an ohio man who sends his social security checks 
although the average gift is 50000 and many citizens included the 
treasury as a beneficiary in their wills the fund also receives 
envelopes containing pennies 
they get a lot of 2cent gifts people putting in their two 
cents its such a cynical negative thing to do mrs fishburn 
said 
mrs fishburn who coordinates the effort from her new berlin 
home donates 3 percent of her familys income 
the us treasury manages a debt reduction fund created by 
congress in 1961 after sara vaughan clayton of texas willed annual 
income from a 20 million trust fund for use in retiring the 
national debt 
the taxdeductible contributions to mrs fishburns group are 
used to pay off treasury bonds notes and bills the government 
sells to finance its debt treasury spokesman pete hollenbach said 
by and large most if the contributions are small its a way 
for many americans to express their patriotism and the love for the 
country hollenbach said the fund has received more than 17 
million he said 
the national debt stood at 3061 trillion on april 30

congress only psychiatrist hasnt minded the 
shrink jokes since a political opponent took out a fullpage 
newspaper ad asking voters do you want a liberal seattle 
psychiatrist to be your next governor 
that was 1980 when ronald reagan won so liberal was not a 
good tag to have recalls rep jim mcdermott dwash 
and there is always the issue of big city versus small town 
so seattle wasnt a good place to be from he threw in my 
profession for good measure im not sure which of the three was 
the worst 
mcdermott said the voters answered the campaign question with a 
resounding hell no awarding him only 17 percent of the vote 
in the 1980 election 
eventually he left his private practice and took his 17 years of 
state legislative experience to africa where he worked as a us 
state department psychiatrist in zaire responsible for the mental 
health of american officials in 26 embassies 
elected to congress in 1988 the chicago native who first 
entered politics because of his opposition to the vietnam war has 
found his colleagues curious about his medical work 
when people approach me they always tell jokes about 
psychiatrists i think they do that in part to get to know me i 
usually respond with a joke or humor he said 
most people if they have not had direct contact with a 
psychiatrist are a little put off by the idea that you could read 
minds or look into peoples thoughts some say to me that they 
have to be careful what they say in front of me i always tell them 
i never mix business with pleasure he said 
mcdermott 53 said the mind is of great interest to people 
because it is the most complex of all human aspects however he 
said congress and the public continue to shy away from addressing 
mental health issues 
most people would rather think that everything is rational and 
everything is going to be okay they like to avoid thinking about 
it because of that it is a hard issue to get money for we dont 
like to think there are a lot of mentally ill people he said 
being in congress has given mcdermott a chance to observe his 
colleagues 
if you look at them they are an amazingly accurate 
crosssection of the united states in terms of interests 
abilities reputations and economic status they are quite 
reflective of the general population he said 
mcdermott said during his years in the state legislature he 
developed a level of trust with his colleagues that would prompt 
them to share family medical history and talk about family 
psychological problems he even made referrals for some 
mcdermott said he gets the impression that every successful 
politician has a bit of psychiatrist in him or her 
a good psychiatrist understands people and thats what this 
business is a people business every single one of them congress 
members got elected for many they cant explain how they did it 
but instinctively they understand people the only advantage i have 
over them is i spent a long time studying it

gov bill clinton hoped to avoid a runoff in todays democratic 
primary in arkansas and us rep romano mazzoli of kentucky 
sought an 11th term in a bid handicapped by his refusal to accept 
money from political action committees 
also in arkansas blacks were guaranteed greater representation 
in the legislature because 31 districts were redrawn seats in five 
of 10 newly created blackmajority districts are being sought by 
only black candidates 
clinton must get more than 50 percent of the vote to win the 
nomination outright for another term otherwise the top two 
votegetters will meet in a runoff 
a poll released friday gave clinton 55 percent to 22 percent for 
tom mcrae former president of a charitable foundation with 19 
percent undecided three other contenders had 3 percent or less 
clinton 43 was the nations youngest governor when he was 
first elected in 1978 he was defeated in 1980 but was elected 
again in 1982 1984 and 1986 the first year the governorship was 
made a fouryear term 
the republican gubernatorial race pits us rep tommy robinson 
a former police chief and sheriff against sheffield nelson a 
former utility executive 
robinson and nelson may pick up some traditional democratic 
voters because they switched parties last year arkansas voters may 
participate in either primary without making a commitment for the 
november general election 
in kentucky the closest contest for congress may be the 
democratic primary in mazzolis louisville district former tv 
newsman jeffrey hutter who got 39 percent of the vote against 
mazzoli two years ago is trying again the other candidate is 
louisville alderman paul bather 
mazzolis opponents have questioned whether he has done enough 
for louisville since he was first elected in 1970 hutter has 
criticized mazzoli for voting to repeal the catastrophic health 
care act raise the salaries of members of congress and severely 
restrict abortions 
but mazzolis decision not to accept pacs may be his downfall 
as of may 18 mazzoli said he had raised 133370 from individual 
contributors hutter had raised 172550 by may 9 including 
40000 from pacs 
mazzoli 57 decided in december to set an example by becoming 
one of only about two dozen members of congress who reject pac 
contributions pacs had contributed to about half of his past 
campaigns 
ive always felt politics belongs to the people not to the 
large special interest groups mazzoli said instead of 
leveling the playing field pacs have become a force to keep 
incumbents in office

a major early painting by peter paul rubens 
will go on permanent display at the national gallery of art 
tomorrow on the 350th anniversary of the death of the 17th century 
flemish master of the baroque 
the gallery last year purchased the 3by4foot oil the fall 
of phaeton from a private collection in london for a sum 
director j carter brown described as in the multimilliondollar 
range 
the painting which depicts a dramatic scene from greek 
mythology was cleaned to restore its colors to their original 
brilliance it joins the eight other works from rubens later 
period in the national gallerys permanent collection 
except for its inclusion in an exhibition in cologne west 
germany in 1977 before it was cleaned the fall of the 
phaeton had never been displayed publicly 
little is known of its ownership since rubens painted it in 1605 
while studying in italy 
brown and arthur wheelock the gallerys curator of northern 
baroque painting said the painting is important because of what it 
tells about rubens in the early formative stage of his development 
as the greatest baroque artist

more than 200 house democrats are asking 
president bush to ask congress for more money to investigate and 
prosecute fraud in the worsening savings and loan crisis 
the democrats sent a letter to bush last friday saying the 50 
million appropriated to the justice department to investigate and 
prosecute sampl fraud isnt enough to handle the backlog of thousands 
of potential criminal cases 
an additional 100 million is needed said the democrats led by 
rep charles e schumer of new york and joined by some lawmakers 
who last week accused the justice department of dragging its feet 
on prosecuting thrift fraud 
sean young a white house spokesman said over the weekend that 
bush had not received the letter yet and would have no immediate 
comment on it 
bush said last thursday that the savings and loan crisis 
causes me great concern and that policymakers first priority 
is protecting depositors against losses

administration estimates of how much new borrowing the government 
needs to clean up the savings and loan mess from 50 billion 
forecast a year ago to between 90 billion and 130 billion 
including interest the cost to taxpayers is expected to exceed 
325 billion over the next 30 years

health experts often have disagreed about what 
are the healthiest foods for a long life but after holding a 
food summit last year 10 health agencies have now come up with 
a list of jointly recommended dietary guidelines 
the five private and five public agencies call it the healthy 
american diet with six general diet principles for everyone over 
the age of 2 
eat a nutritionally adequate diet consisting of a variety of 
foods 
reduce consumption of fat especially saturated fat and 
cholesterol 
achieve and maintain a reasonable body weight 
increase consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber 
reduce intake of sodium 
consume alcohol in moderation if at all children adolescents 
and pregnant women should abstain 
the health organizations ranging from the american academy of 
pediatrics to the u s department of agriculture also recommended 
that some segments of the population take additional measures 
to avoid dental cavities the groups recommended fluoride in 
drinking water and limited betweenmeal snacks containing sugar 
adolescents and young women should eat more highcalcium foods 
such as lowfat dairy products 
children adolescents and women of childbearing age also should 
include ironrich foods such as red meat fish and cereals in 
their diets to avoid anemia 
many of the groups such as the american heart association 
already had recommended diets but the experts diets often 
differed slightly from organization to organization 
dr alan chait of the university of washington in seattle who 
is chairman of the heart associations nutrition committee said a 
common message on diet recommendations should help reduce 
confusion among the public

a new guerrilla movement has emerged 
in this former dutch colony and seized a hydroelectric dam cutting 
off power to the capital and key bauxite smelters the government 
said 
deputy prime minister willy soemita said monday that the group 
sprang to life from breakaway followers of ronny brunswijks jungle 
commando which had been battling the military in the isolated 
south american republic since 1986 
soemita said the government received word from the new group 
that it wanted to meet with president ramsewak shankar and armed 
forces commander desi bouterse 
he said he didnt know what its demands were but said a 
government delegation was to meet with the rebels at an unspecified 
time 
he said the group seized control of the brokondo region in 
central suriname over the weekend and overtook the afobaka 
hydroelectric about 60 miles south of the capital 
paramaribo was without power over much of the weekend but most 
electricity had returned on monday 
the deputy prime minister said he didnt know if the rebels were 
still controlling the dam 
the situation is very unclear he said 
he said the new leader of the group is barrabas as a former 
notorious leader of the jungle commando is known 
bouterse a former military ruler who came to power in a 1980 
coup had opposed a tentative peace agreement the new civilian 
government reached last july with the jungle commando saying it 
gave brunswijk too much power 
bouterse returned the country to civilian rule in november 1987 
but the army still retains the real power in the country 
the jungle commando is made up mostly of bush negroes 
descendants of runaway slaves who make up about 60000 of the 
countrys 400000 dutch speaking population

the hoover institution a conservative think tank at stanford 
university has been dropped from mikhail gorbachevs itinerary 
but a visit to a typical middleclass minneapolis family is still 
on the agenda at least for his wife 
soviet officials decided gorbachevs schedule was just too 
tight for a tour of the hoover institution when the soviet leader 
visits the university 25 miles from san francisco next week 
stanford spokesman bob freelen said monday 
gorbachevs tentative plans had included a meeting with scholars 
at the institution which was founded by future president hoover in 
1919 and boasts one of the worlds biggest collections of material 
from the russian revolution 
gorbachev after summit talks this week with president bush 
will visit minnesota on sunday and the san francisco bay area on 
sunday and monday 
in minnesota paul ridgeway lead advance coordinator for the 
visit said gorbachev will stop at the governors mansion and meet 
with midwest business and agricultural leaders at a hotel 
a visit to the home of steve and karen watson also remained in 
the planning but probably only raisa gorbachev will take part 
ridgeway said 
the gorbachevs have said they would like to visit a typical 
middleclass family with at least three children and a dog the 
watsons have four children and a dog 
georgiy markosov a counselor with the soviet embassy said no 
proposals by the governors office had been eliminated but 
ridgeway said gorbachev will not address the public from the 
capitol steps as gov rudy perpich wanted 
stops expected to be in the final itinerary include the 
cathedral of st paul and the sculpture garden at walker art center 
in minneapolis ridgeway said perpich has suggested an ecumenical 
service at the cathedral 
in san francisco gorbachev is to meet with former president 
reagan for breakfast at the soviet consulate on june 4 
during visit to stanford the soviet leader will deliver a 
speech meet with former secretary of state george shultz now a 
professor of international economics at stanford and talk with 
other faculty members and students 
scholars at the hoover institution a longtime bastion of 
anticommunism had planned to show gorbachev the collection from 
the russian revolution and offer papers suggesting ways of solving 
the soviet unions economic problems 
charles palm an associate director of the institution said he 
was disappointed by the change in plans 
thousands of items including mug shots of revolutionaries and 
secret czarist police files are at the institution 
hoover scholars have included alexander kerensky premier of the 
provisional government that followed the downfall of czar nicholas 
ii in the spring of 1917 only to be toppled in the bolshevik 
revolution months later

lithuanian authorities say the soviet economic 
embargo has forced sharp cutbacks in electric power to industries 
and idled 40000 workers but a new poll shows the hardships have 
not weakened support for the republics independence drive 
in neighboring latvia on monday the parliament approved a 
resolution rejecting president mikhail s gorbachevs may 14 decree 
declaring independence moves by latvia and estonia to be illegal 
and unconstitutional 
after sharp debate latvian legislators approved a resolution on 
monday that called gorbachevs decree illegal interference in 
the republics affairs the soviet tv news program vremya 
reported 
antiindependence legislators did not participate in the vote 
it reported 
the three baltic republics forcibly annexed by the soviet union 
in 1940 are all seeking to restore independence while latvia and 
estonia have adopted a more gradual approach lithuania declared 
its independence on march 11 
gorbachev cut off all oil and most natural gas supplies to 
lithuania on april 18 for its refusal to rescind proindependence 
laws 
electricity is being generated at only two power plants in 
lithuania a nuclear plant at ignalina and the oilburning 
elektrenai station and neither is operating at full capacity 
according to radio vilnius reporter audrius braukyla 
braukyla said homes were unaffected by the power cutbacks 
according to a government communique reported monday by radio 
vilnius power supply to industrial enterprises is being severely 
limited affecting nearly 200000 workers at those plants 
the lithuanian news agency elta said the power cutback would 
affect 300 factories and enterprises 
the communique said 40000 workers have become jobless since the 
soviet economic embargo was imposed 
nearly 2000 people have registered at the republics 
unemployment office and 500 have been given new jobs mostly in 
the farming sector braukyla quoted the communique as saying 
he quoted lithuanian legislator antanas karoblis as saying 
factories under moscows control were receiving supplies of oil and 
raw materials 
braukyla said recent motor traffic seemed greater than early in 
the oil cutoff a taxi driver told him lithuanians are striking 
deals with residents of the neighboring republic of byelorussia 
who are bringing in hundreds of gallons of gasoline in cars and 
small trucks 
some were even trading lithuanian chocolates for gasoline he 
added 
despite the hardships the lithuanian radio station said a 
public opinion poll conducted this month of almost 1000 people in 
vilnius the republics capital indicated a strengthening of 
support for the declaration of independence 
asked do you think the lithuanian supreme council parliament 
should revoke the decision about the restoration of the statehood 
of lithuania 72 percent said no and 19 percent said yes the 
radio station said in april 21 percent said the declaration 
should be revoked 
the poll was conducted by the lithuanian branch of the allunion 
public opinion poll center which gave no margin of error

the dollar rebounded against the yen today and the 
weaker japanese currency helped push down share prices on the tokyo 
stock exchange after a fiveday rise 
the dollar closed at 15070 yen up 125 yen from mondays close 
of 14945 yen after opening at 14902 yen it ranged between 
14900 yen and 15075 yen 
presumably there was an exhaustion of dollarbearish 
sentiment and people took profits on the downside said masato 
nakamura of sumitomo bank he said the dollar could go back above 
151 yen this week 
the dollars turnaround was initiated by the west german marks 
rally in cross trading with the yen he said the dollar generally 
has been falling since april 18 when it closed at 15987 and it 
fell below 150 yen on monday for the first time in tokyo in nearly 
three months

nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues said john courtney a 
broker with wi carr the nikkei index fell 37394 points closing 
at 3281767 
its strange but within the market it seems to matter more 
what happens in germany or the united states than what happens 
here he said the market is ultrasensitive to changes in 
exchange and interest rates he said 
profittaking after a fiveday surge contributed to todays 
decline brokers said the nikkei had gained 173544 points or 
535 percent over the preceding week 
many institutional investors sold shares when the index passed 
the 33000 target level said wataru watanabe a trader with daiwa

former mayor kevin h white has acknowledged what 
prosecutors couldnt prove almost a decade ago that a planned 
birthday party for his wife was a scheme to put money in his pocket 
in an interview sunday on whdhtv white said the party was an 
idea artificially hatched to make up for a problem the problem was 
i could barely survive on my salary but he said establishing the 
fund was not improper 
after a great deal of publicity the 1981 party was canceled and 
about 122000 in donations was returned at the time white 
angrily denied allegations of corruption no evidence was produced 
to link him to organizing the party and no charges were filed 
white did not seek reelection in 1983 after 16 years as mayor 
he now teaches at boston university 
the state ethics commission and the us justice department 
looked into the birthday party for whites wife kathryn in an 
attempt to prove it was a scheme to put money in whites personal 
account 
the commission censured white for conflict of interest by using 
his office to gain unwarranted privileges the two investigations 
are closed 
his position and the position that was expressed for him by 
his attorneys was that the birthday party was for kathryn said 
former assistant us attorney robert j cordy former counsel to 
the ethics commission 
now it seems it was a scheme to raise money for himself to 
supplement his income that was exactly the danger the ethics 
commission was concerned about 
its an extraordinary confession said former assistant us 
attorney daniel i small 
whites salary was raised by 25000 to 65000 less than four 
months before the party was to take place

a shipping company hired to supply milk powder 
to the famineravaged sudan is under federal investigation because 
the powder was unfit for human consumption the new york times 
reported today 
court papers filed by the government allege that the company 
amg services promised to deliver highquality milk powder to the 
sudan but substituted an undrinkable diluted powder 
amg president martyn merritt said the inferior powder was 
supplied by a sri lankan subcontractor 
merritt warned us government officials about the switch but 
was ignored he said 
i didnt want this stuff to get sent off and have people get 
sick from it he said 
under an agency for international development program the 
united states buys food for the sudan one of the worlds poorest 
countries 
amg received 936000 to ship hundreds of tons of milk powder in 
january 1989 the court papers said but the sudanese never 
received a shipment the cargo apparently got mixed up in sri 
lanka where an amg subsidiary was supposed to forward it 
sudanese government investigators went to sri lanka found a 
substitute shipment of the lowquality milk powder and rejected it 
erwin shustak an attorney for merritt said he believed amg was 
under investigation because of a dispute years ago between merritt 
and a government investigator 
prosecutors would not comment

moderate leaders at the arab summit 
appeared today to have persuaded hardliners to take a balanced 
and prudent approach to the united states under fire for its 
support of israel conference sources said 
but despite their reported acquiescence plo chairman yasser 
arafat and iraqi president saddam hussein made belicose speeches 
against the united states and israel at mondays opening session of 
the twoday summit 
in another development today a senior plo official said saddam 
and president hashemi rafsanjani of iran could meet in the next few 
weeks to formally end the persian gulf war which was halted by a 
ceasefire in 1988 
the conference sources said that as the heads of state met for a 
second day today moderates headed by egypt and saudi arabia seemed 
to gain ground despite often heated debates over taking washington 
to task 
they said on condition of anonymity that saddam and king hussein 
of jordan who have favored a tough antius line agreed to take 
a more moderate approach they did not say what instigated the 
change 
president saddam has switched to a balanced and prudent 
approach that will placate hardliners and satisfy the moderates 
said one top persian gulf official its now up to the united 
states to accord the arabs due respect and handle the middle east 
more maturely and constructively 
the conference was called as a show of arab unity against what 
saddam has said is a western and israeli campaign against iraq it 
was also sought ways to stem the largescale emigration of soviet 
jews to israel 
the arab leaders met behind closed doors in baghdads heavily 
guarded conference center today sources said they were to complete 
a memorandum on issues related to the arabisraeli conflict that 
will be sent to the ussoviet summit which convenes in 
washington on thursday 
hardliners such as libyas leader col moammar gadhafi were 
maintaining a low profile sources said syria and lebanon have 
boycotted the arab summit while morocco algeria and oman sent 
senior government officials 
the turnout was seen as a clear sign of discord between 
hardliners and the moderates over how tough a line they should 
take against the united states 
sources said arab leaders were incensed by a 16page us state 
department note sent to the 21member arab league last week urging 
iraq to moderate both its action and its rhetoric and advising 
the heads of state to avoid excessively ardent language 
the memorandum also called on the arabs to recognize israel and 
uphold the right of soviet jews to emigrate to israel if they want 
the arabs particularly the hardliners viewed the state 
department document as an attempt by washington to dictate policy 
palestinian officials complained the bush administration is 
treating us like schoolchildren 
many arabs have been angered by the united states policy 
regarding the emigration of soviet jews to israel expected to 
reach 750000 over the next years they say washington has driven 
away many from the united states by tightening american immigration 
restrictions 
arabs states contend israel plans to settle many of the soviet 
jews in the israeliheld west bank and gaza strip land the 
palestinians declared part of a palestinian state in 1988 
the arabs also say washington has not done enough to pressure 
israel into agreeing to peace talks with arafat 
speaking to the 15 kings sheiks and presidents at the summit 
monday arafat reviled washington for indirectly encouraging the 
soviet jewish emigres to settle in israel 
we are duty bound to use all weapons including sanctions 
economic boycotts and political and psychological pressures 
against states establishment and companies that participate in 
aggression against arab territory arafat said 
he berated the us congress for describing jerusalem as 
israels capital in recent nonbinding house and senate 
resolutions this illegitimate declaration amounts to aggression 
on arab dignity arafat shouted 
he said arab sector of jerusalem conquered by israel in 1967 
is part of the palestinian territory under israeli occupation it 
is the capital of the state of palestine 
also monday saddam warned again that iraq will use weapons of 
mass destruction against israel if the israelis used similar 
weapons against iraq or any other arab country 
he did not spell out what weapons he had in mind but he was 
apparently referring to israels nuclear bombs and iraqs 
burgeoning arsenal of longrange missiles and chemical weapons 
the united states bears a basic and primary responsibility for 
the policy of aggression and expansion practiced by the zionist 
entity against the arabs saddam declared

mayor marion barry who faces trial on drug 
charges next week isnt ruling out a reelection campaign despite 
advice that he give up on seeking a fourth term some mayoral aides 
say 
there were meetings this week and everything was very 
forwardthinking one of barrys top political aides said monday 
everything hinges on this trial and what we are hearing is that 
he will make no firm decision or announcement until after that 
a report published today however quoted unnamed barry friends 
as saying the mayor would consider a plea agreement provided he was 
allowed to plead guilty only to misdemeanor charges 
the washington post report said the friends stressed that no 
talks were under way and that any deal would have to involve the 
sealing of all evidence against barry including a videotape 
allegedly showing the mayor smoking crack cocaine 
law enforcement sources told the associated press that no talks 
between prosecutors and barry had begun 
the direction of the legal case should become clearer later 
today when a federal judge is scheduled to rule on a defense 
motion to split the charges against barry into two trials 
the comments by barry political aides indicating the mayor has 
not ruled out seeking reelection were at odds with a monday report 
on wrctv that said barry has told close advisers he will not seek 
reelection 
barry 54 is scheduled to go to trial june 4 for a variety of 
drug and perjury charges stemming from his jan 18 arrest in a fbi 
sting operation and a separate 15month federal probe into this 
ties to a convicted drug dealer 
the mayor who entered seven weeks of substance abuse treatment 
following his arrest faces 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three 
felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use 
if convicted of a felony barry would be barred from holding 
office or running for reelection however a washington post poll 
released friday showed that the mayor has held onto core supporters 
since his arrest the survey showed that barry and city council 
member john ray lead a field of six with each receiving 23 percent 
support 
barry has not publicly disclosed his reelection plans but has 
been making a series of campaignstyle appearances around the city 
in recent weeks in addition barry campaign officials on friday 
picked up petitions for a potential reelection bid the first 
formal step to a possible candidacy 
the mayor was pleased with the poll and both he and others 
have said in he last few days that it the poll is another 
indication that he should keep his options open said a top 
political aide who met with him in recent days 
however there are plenty of people who are urging him not to 
put himself and the city through this trial and to seek a deal 
said an aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
some city officials and personal associates of the mayors have 
been encouraging barry to seek a plea bargain agreement in hopes of 
preventing their names from coming out during the trial city 
government sources said 
many of those urging barry to avoid court proceedings seek to 
avoid being put in the position of having to testify on whether 
they ever saw barry use drugs or if they were aware of his alleged 
drug problem one source said 
its a question of loyalty said one city official 
regardless of what they may or may not know they dont want to 
be put in the position of testifying against their boss 
for the time being aides familiar with barrys campaign plans 
say that volunteers will concentrate on gaining the 2000 
signatures needed to place his name on the ballot and then wait for 
the trial 
prosecutors and r kenneth mundy barrys attorney have 
estimated that the legal proceedings could take at least a month 
to run in the citys sept 11 democratic primary the mayor must 
submit his petition signatures by july 5

all three cities are in dade county the densely populated area 
of about 2 million people that includes miami 
since his appointment two years ago us attorney dexter 
lehtinen a former republican state senator from dade county has 
made corruption in public office his no 1 priority 
some people question his motives 
there is a major suspicion in this town that dexter has 
politicized the us attorneys office said miami attorney 
jeffrey weiner vice president of the national association of 
criminal defense lawyers 
the scandals in hialeah and miami beach threaten the political 
careers of two democratic stars both coming off landslide 
reelections in november 
in hialeah raul martinez mayor of floridas fifthlargest city 
since 1981 was indicted in april on charges of extorting nearly 1 
million in cash and real estate from developers for zoning 
approvals he was suspended along with a city councilman who 
allegedly traded his vote for 24000 in cash 
martinez emerged as a potential challenger to lehtinens wife 
ileana roslehtinen in last years us house race but he stayed 
out and ms roslehtinen won the seat for the republicans 
the us attorneys office said lehtinen disqualified himself 
from the investigation into martinez who has been under federal 
scrutiny for years two other council members in the city of 
200000 have pleaded guilty to federal charges in the last three 
years 
no trial date has been set for martinez who faces up to 180 
years in prison and 225 million in fines if convicted martinez 
41 has denied all charges and his supporters say the case is 
politically tainted 
in miami beach thirdterm mayor alex daoud has not been charged 
but is being probed by federal and state authorities and by the 
florida bar 
among items being investigated are 35000 daoud received from 
centrust companies before the thrift was taken over by federal 
regulators tens of thousands of dollars in renovations to his home 
and thousands of dollars in gifts from miami beach socialites 
daoud a popular and mediaconscious mayor has become 
tightlipped about his troubles except to make periodic denials of 
any wrongdoing 
on friday city inspectors found more than 235000 in 
improvements to daouds sunset island home the miami herald 
reported daoud lacked city permits for most of the work did not 
pay all required fees failed to get final inspections and

a federal grand jury has subpoenaed thousands of pages of city 
documents as part of its investigation of daouds dealings with 
david paul former head of centrust 
in sweetwater mayor irain gonzalez and five of seven council 
members were named jan 25 in an extortion indictment 
two pleaded guilty and the mayor and two council members are on 
trial another council member named as an unindicted 
coconspirator testified against them in a case involving a 
10000 bribe allegedly made by a developer for a zoning variance 
jury deliberations began friday and were recessed until today 
miami mayor xavier suarez a lawyer said the accumulation of 
scandals doesnt mean that city government in the booming miami 
metropolitan area is suddenly for sale i guess its just 
circumstance he said 
he added one of my partners is from a state in the northeast 
where theyve had a lot of corruption and he said some of the 
stuff that hes been reading about here sounds pretty minor 
compared to what he was used to

less than three years ago boris n yeltsin was 
reviled in the soviet press attacked by top party officials and 
rebuffed by his former mentor soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
somehow he turned it all to his advantage 
yeltsin a burly 59yearold siberian won election today to a 
powerful and visible post the presidency of the russian 
federation by far the soviet unions largest republic 
it wasnt a quick and easy victory it took three strenuous 
rounds of balloting in the russian congress gorbachev opposed 
yeltsins candidacy 
but once again yeltsin showed his talent for overcoming odds 
for seizing the moment for using popular support to get what he 
wants 
and as usual if powerful higherups stood in his way it only 
seemed to strengthen him and his populist message of radical 
economic and political reforms and less power for the central 
government 
in 1985 yeltsin a construction engineer by trade was an 
obscure official in the ural mountains industrial city of 
sverdlovsk not far from his native village of butka 
then gorbachev brought him to moscow to take over the capital 
citys communist party organization and gave him a nonvoting seat 
on the ruling communist party politburo 
it didnt take yeltsin long to start making waves 
he showed little reverence for the party hierarchy he 
campaigned in stores and on trolley buses to improve food supplies 
and public services he spoke out against special privileges for 
the government and party elite 
the gravellyvoiced whitehaired yeltsin quickly won a 
following 
people identify with yeltsin the weekly moscow news wrote 
last year in a fullpage story headlined the boris yelsin 
phenomenon 
muscovites were tired of watching their leaders rocket by in 
sleek limousines while they stood in line to buy soap sugar and 
other scarce items yeltsins borshchtineverypot message had 
immediate appeal 
like millions of other soviet citizens yeltsin became 
increasingly impatient with the pace of gorbachevs reforms 
characteristically he did not hesitate to say so and 
characteristically he went too far 
in 1987 he made a stinging speech to a closed meeting of the 
communist party central committee criticizing the slow pace of 
reforms 
that earned him a sharp reprimand from his former mentor 
gorbachev and brought vitriolic attacks from the party officials 
who accused him of dealing a stab in the back to economic 
reform 
the criticism of yeltsin was published in the press he was 
stripped of his post as moscow party chief and hospitalized for 
heart trouble the word went out that he was finished politically 
gorbachev and yeltsin never did patch things up and yeltsin 
remained on the outs with top leaders 
but he made that rift work for him the open disdain of the 
communist party apparatus enhanced yeltsins populist image and 
helped him win the backing of millions of supporters 
gorbachev actively campaigned against yeltsins bid for the 
russian presidency he told the russian congress last week that 
yeltsins call for russian sovereignty was an attempt to cut 
russia off from socialism 
yeltsin in turn spoke against the soviet governments program 
for gradually transforming the countrys crippled centrally planned 
economy to a partial market economy 
that program which will eventually double the cost of food 
caused panicbuying in moscow some congressional deputies said 
yeltsins candidacy got a boost from public anxiety over the plan 
although yeltsins win today seemed like a sudden triumph his 
comeback didnt happen all at once 
after his fall from political grace in 1987 he began rebuilding 
his power base that led to a landslide victory in march 1989 in 
direct popular elections to the soviet congress of peoples 
deputies the national parliament 
yeltsin was swept into office with almost 90 percent of the 
vote crushing his apparatusbacked opponent 
later that year he carried out a deft procedural maneuver to 
win election to the supreme soviet the national legislature 
and early this year he was elected a deputy of the russian 
federation congress which today chose him president he also 
remains a member of the partys policymaking central committee 
now his image as a man who can take on the system and win is 
stronger than ever

the supreme court today refused to let states 
require stockbrokers to give investors the option of suing rather 
than seeking arbitration over alleged broker fraud 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that barred 
massachusetts from requiring brokers to make arbitration clauses 
optional not mandatory in brokerage contracts 
the massachusetts appeal the court acted on today was supported 
by 30 other states whose officials said a federal appeals court 
ruling leaves them powerless to protect consumers from being 
coerced to enter arbitration agreements 
but the bush administration told the justices the massachusetts 
appeal should be rejected 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals in boston ruled aug 31 
that the massachusetts regulations are preempted by federal law 
the brokerage industry customarily requires customers to agree 
to arbitrate all disputes as a condition of opening an account 
but in 1987 the justices ruled by a 54 vote that if such 
arbitration clauses are in the contracts signed by investors 
disputes over alleged fraud are to be resolved in arbitration not 
in lawsuits 
massachusetts secretary of state in 1988 imposed regulations 
prohibiting brokers from making arbitration agreements 
nonnegotiable conditions for opening accounts the regulations 
also required brokers to tell customers about the legal effects of 
mandatory arbitration clauses 
the states action immediately was challenged by the securities 
industry association and 10 brokerage firms affiliated with it 
a federal judge ruled for the brokers and the appeals court 
upheld that ruling 
the long and short of it is that we can find no evidence of a 
clear congressional command to override the unambiguous 
proarbitration mandate of the federal arbitration act in the 
securities field the appeals court said 
in the states appeal massachusetts attorney general james m 
shannon said the august ruling has national implications for 
state regulation of mandatory arbitration agreements in banking 
health care the automobile and many other industries 
shannon said the federal arbitration act does not preempt all 
state regulation of arbitration 
lawyers for the securities industry and the justice department 
urged the justices to reject the states appeal government lawyers 
said federal law does preempt such state regulation

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
two ku klux klan groups and four men ordered to pay more than 
800000 for organizing a demonstration that turned into a violent 
attack on civil rights marchers in georgia 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
punitivedamages award did not violate the freespeech rights of 
the kkk and its sympathizers 
the civil rights demonstration in forsyth county ga was led 
by state legislator hosea williams on jan 17 1987 the birthday 
of the rev martin luther king jr 
the kkk staged a counterdemonstration intended to convince 
blacks to stay out of the county 
a halfhour before the civil rights march began grand dragon 
david holland of the southern white knights of the kkk addressed 
the counterdemonstrators 
holland who later denied he was inciting a riot told his 
followers we need to let them know that were going to keep this 
place white lets disperse and go greet those filthy halfape 
niggers brothers 
the invisible empire knights of the ku klux klan was the second 
group helping lead the counterdemonstrators 
klan members and sympathizers climbed fences and headed for the 
marchers throwing rocks and bottles and shouting obscenities and 
racial epithets 
as the counterdemonstrators surrounded the marchers and their 
bus law enforcement officials loaded the marchers onto the bus to 
protect them and moved the bus away the counterdemonstrators 
pelted the bus with debris as it withdrew 
the next day holland said in a speech in raleigh nc the 
ku klux klan sent that nigger hosea williams and his busload of 
race traitors back to atlanta with three or four windows busted 
out of that bus 
he said any future march should be met with similar tactics 
the marchers sued and a federal jury decided that the kkk 
groups and 11 individuals violated the marchers civil rights 
the jury awarded 2500 in compensatory damages more than 
700000 in punitive damages against the kkk groups 43859 
against holland and 26316 each against edward stephens daniel 
carver sr and franklin shirley stephens and carver were kkk 
officers and shirley said he is a white supremacist 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld the awards last 
year 
there is ample evidence the kkk groups and the individuals 
plotted not only to avail themselves of the opportunity to 
express views contrary to those held by the marchers but also to 
disrupt and stop the brotherhood march by violent means the 
appeals court said 
a jury may award punitive damages in a civil rights action 
upon its determination that the defendant was motivated by an evil 
motive or intent or where the defendant was recklessly or callously 
indifferent to federally protected rights the appeals court 
added 
lawyers for the counterdemonstrators said holland in 
addressing the group prior to the march was urging his listeners 
to jeer and to verbally abuse the marchers but not to attack 
them 
the attorneys also said the size of the punitivedamages awards 
shows the demonstrators were punished for their unpopular 
political and social views in violation of their freespeech 
rights 
the case is stephens vs mckinney 891558

dutch police alerted all border 
guards offered a reward and investigated dozens of tips today but 
they were unable to determine the identity of the ira killers of 
two australian tourists 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility for sunday 
nights shooting of the two australians saying it tragically 
mistook them for british servicemen 
the victims were driving a britishregistered car and the 
attack took place in a district of this southern dutch city 
frequented by british soldiers stationed in nearby west germany 
investigators said up to 20 people witnessed the shootings but 
no one had been able to give them a good description of the killers 
of stephen melrose and nick spanos australian citizens who lived 
in london 
national police spokesman louis steens said about 40 tips had 
come in since police offered a 52000 reward late monday for 
information leading to arrests in the slayings 
in australia prime minister bob hawke today condemned the 
killings and denounced the iras description of the two as 
accidental victims of war 
this sort of warped logic of war casualties adds insult to a 
mortal injury hawke said 
although dutch police immediately alerted border guards it is 
only a 10minute drive from roermond to the nearest belgian and 
west german border crossings and the belgian border is virtually 
unguarded 
steens told reporters at national police headquarters that 
investigators believed it was sheer coincidence that the 
australians arrived just as an ira hit squad was seeking a target 
roermonds cafe district was the site of another ira attack in 1988 
melrose 24 was shot as he was preparing to take a picture of 
the floodlit town hall spanos 28 was shot inside their car 
melroses wife lyndal 29 and spanos girlfriend vicky coss 
24 were uninjured they fled screaming for help according to 
eyewitnesses 
steens said the two women had returned to london and their 
condition is still very bad 
they are in heavy shock he said 
he refused to provide certain details about the attack such as 
the number of bullets fired or the weapons used 
roermond residents laid a wreath and attached white and pink 
carnations to police fences surrounding the shooting site in their 
historic market square a chalk outline of melroses body was still 
visible 
there are far more eyewitnesses of the shooting than in 1988 
when the ira killed three offduty british servicemen in 
coordinated attacks here and in nieuwbergen 30 miles to the north 
said steens but witnesses to this attack disagree on the number 
and description of the ira gunmen he said 
the almost exclusively catholic irish republican army is 
fighting to push the british out of protestantdominated northern 
ireland join it with the republic of ireland and set up an 
allireland socialist state

the supreme court today increased the federal 
governments power to keep some criminal defendants behind bars 
while they await trial even if a key bail law was violated 
the justices by a 63 vote spared the government from having 
to free on bail some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to 
flee before trial 
the decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that said 
pretrial release is required even for a defendant who could have 
been held in custody if a pretrial detention hearing is not held 
the first time that person appears in court 
the safety of society does not become forfeit to the accident 
of the noncompliance with statutory time limits where the 
government is ready and able to show release on bail is not 
feasible justice anthony m kennedy wrote for the court 
neither the timing requirements nor any other part of the 
bail reform act of 1984 can be read to require or even suggest 
that a timing error must result in the release of a person who 
should otherwise be detained kennedy said 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall dissented 
writing for the three stevens said that in writing the bail law 
congress required prosecutors to turn square corners 
the court today however permits federal prosecutors to 
violate the law with impunity 
the justices in 1987 upheld the federal law allowing denial of 
bail before trial to people deemed dangerous to the community even 
if accused of nonviolent crimes 
before the 1984 law pretrial bail generally would be denied 
only if a judge determined the defendant was likely to flee 
in practice however federal judges could get around the old 
law by setting very high bail ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing the 
defendants appearance in court but effectively keeping the accused 
in custody while awaiting trial 
a provision in the 1984 law states that a hearing to determine 
whether pretrial detention is justified must be held immediately 
upon the persons first appearance before the judicial officer 
unless that person or the attorney for the government seeks a 
continuance 
a federal trial judge and the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the first appearance provision of the law had been 
ignored in the case of guadalupe montalvomurillo charged with 
possessing nearly 1 million worth of cocaine 
montalvomurillo a mexican legally living in this country was 
stopped in february 1989 while driving a pickup truck near the 
mexican border at orogrande nm 
us customs service agents found 72 pounds of cocaine with a 
wholesale value of almost 1 million in the truck 
at a feb 16 1989 proceeding a federal magistrate put off a 
detention hearing until feb 21 after that hearing the magistrate 
decided to release montalvomurillo on 50000 bail 
government prosecutors appealed to a federal judge who ruled 
that montalvomurillo posed both a danger to the community and a 
risk to flee 
but the judge ruled that the new mexico magistrate in 
postponing the detention hearing for five days violated the 
federal bail laws first appearance rule the judge said the 
only appropriate remedy was the defendants release on bail 
montalvomurillo was freed on 88500 bail and has been a 
fugitive from justice ever since he is believed to have fled to 
mexico

burmas main prodemocracy party is 
claiming an overwhelming victory in the national election and said 
today it would start setting up a constitutional government as soon 
as its win is official 
but kyi maung of the opposition national league for democracy 
said his party would be patient in seeking the transition to 
civilian rule 
the current military government seized power after a bloody 1988 
crackdown on prodemocracy forces 
a final official tally in sundays vote may take weeks due to a 
ng process in votecounting so far the 
militarybacked party had yet to win a single parliamentary seat 
kyi maung said his party was certain it had won at least 322 
seats in the 492seat national legislature the htutlaw 
official results reslow handcountileased so far indicated victories 
by wide 
margins for the national league for democracy in burmas first 
multiparty elections in 30 years in races already decided league 
candidates were winning by an average of 72 percent of the vote to 
about 15 percent for the promilitary national unity party state 
radio said 
of the 43 parliamentary races decided the league won 41 
official radio reported the other two seats went to other 
prodemocracy parties 
the leas personally responsible for 
paying the owed taxes 
the controversy stemmed from the two types of federal taxes owed 
by employers trust fund and nontrust fund taxes and 
the differing consequences of nonpayment 
trust fund taxes are those withheld from employees paychecks 
representing those employees personal income tax unemployment 
insurance and social security taxes 
should an employer fail to pay any trust fund taxes the 
government can collect an equivalent sum directly from the 
officials who were responsible for collecting and paying them 
an employer also may fail to pay its ordinary corporate income 
taxes or other nontrust fund taxes those to be paid directly by 
the corporation and not withheld or collected from someone else 
the government generally cannot impose personal liability on 
corporate officials if a corporations nontrust fund taxes go 
unpaid 
a massachusetts corporation called energy resources co filed 
for bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 while owing about 1 million 
in federal taxes most of which were trust fund taxes 
as part of its courtordered reorganization the taxes owed by 
energy resources were to be paid over four years in making the 
first payment the bankruptcy trustee told the internal revenue 
service to apply it to trust fund taxes owed 
but the irs refused contending the payment could be applied to 
the corporations tax debt as the government agency chose 
the same sequence of events occurred after a rhode island 
corporation called newport offshore filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization in 1985 
court documents did not indicate the business in which either 
corporation was engaged 
federal judges in both states ruled that the irs had to apply 
the tax payments as specified and those rulings were upheld by the 
bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court acknowledged that having the trust fund taxes 
paid off first hurts the governments chances of collecting all the 
money owed 
if the reorganized corporation were to run out of money with 
trust fund debts still owed the government might collect them from 
the people who were to collect and pay that money but if all the 
trust fund taxes have been paid when a reorganized corporation runs 
out of money the government could not go after the corporations 
officers 
todays decision upheld the two corporations legal victories 
writing for the court justice byron r white said a bankruptcy 
court may order the irs to apply tax payments to offset trust 
fund obligations where it concludes that this action is necessary 
for a reorganizations success 
justice harry a blackmun was the courts lone dissenter his 
vote was not accompanied by a written opinion 
the case is us vs energy resources co 89255

the supreme court in a ruling broadening the 
protection against double jeopardy said today that a motorist who 
pleads guilty to drunken driving in a fatal accident may not be 
prosecuted later for homicide 
the 54 ruling in a case from new york extends socalled double 
jeopardy protection against multiple prosecutions for some criminal 
defendants the court said someone convicted of a relatively minor 
offense generally may not be retried on more serious charges based 
on the same alleged conduct 
drunk driving is a national tragedy justice william j 
brennan wrote for the court prosecutors offices are often 
overworked and may not always have the time to monitor seemingly 
minor cases as they wind through the judicial system but these 
facts cannot excuse the need for scrupulous adherence to our 
constitutional principles 
the court barred a new prosecution of thomas j corbin in an 
oct 3 1987 accident on route 55 in lagrange ny 
corbin was accused of crossing a double yellow line and striking 
two other vehicles headed in the opposite driection brenda dirago 
who was driving one of the other cars was killed 
corbin pleaded guilty 24 days later to drunken driving and 
driving on the wrong side of the road he was fined and his 
drivers license was suspended for six months 
the local judge who sentenced corbin apparently was unaware 
someone had died in the crash no one from the dutchess county 
district attorneys office appeared in court when corbin pleaded 
guilty or was sentenced for the traffic violations 
two days after the january 1988 sentencing the district 
attorneys office learned what happened and won an indictment on 
various criminal charges including negligent homicide and reckless 
assault 
the new york state court of appeals threw out the indictment and 
the prosecutors appealed to the supreme court 
groups that favor stricter laws against drunken driving had 
called the appeals court ruling an outrage that tramples on the 
rights of victims 
brennan said today the double jeopardy clause bars any 
susbsequent prosecution in which the government to establish an 
essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution will 
prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant 
has already been prosecuted 
he noted that prosecutors intended to introduce new evidence in 
trying corbin on homicide charges but brennan said the test of 
double jeopardy is not whether the evidence at a new trial is 
different but whether the alleged offense is based on the same 
conduct 
joining brennan were justices byron r white thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
justice antonin scalia in a dissenting opinion said the ruling 
could hamstring prosecutors

the leafdevouring gypsy moth is coming in 
numbers never before seen on the continent scientists and federal 
officials say 
you can almost take that to the bank said charles p 
schwalbe a us department of agriculture expert 
in 1981 the last time the gypsy moth population exploded the 
pest stripped the leaves from 12 million acres of trees and other 
plants in the northeast 
gypsy moth populations rise and fall in cycles averaging about 
seven years now scientists say the region is due for another 
boom and a huge one 
since 1981 the moth infestation has been expanding by about 10 
miles a year from new england and the moths now are stripping 
foliage as far south as virginia and maryland and as far west as 
ohio and michigan 
smaller outbreaks also have been spotted in california oregon 
washington and colorado where the larvae apparently were 
unwittingly transported by humans on the move said schwalbe 
director of usdas animal and plant health inspection service 
those smaller outbreaks however were more easily controlled 
and are being eliminated said vic mastro an entomologist with the 
usda 
the gypsy moth actually is a danger in its caterpillar stage 
eating more than a square yard of foliage by the time it matures 
the attack against the pest has primarily involved spraying of 
baccillus thurigiensis a bacterium known as bt that attacks the 
moths digestive tract and use of diflubenzuron a chemical but 
they havent stopped the pest 
scientists are looking to other methods including release of 
sterilized males to interrupt the moths breeding cycle and use of 
the pests natural enemies including the whitefooted mouse and 
nine kinds of parasitic insects 
a japanese fungus is credited with protecting large sections of 
western massachusetts last year 
the most promising development some say are viruses such as 
gypchek which attacks the gypsy moth from the inside 
martin shapiro a scientist at usdas insect pathology 
laboratory in beltsville md developed and is testing a virus he 
nicknamed abby for the town of abington where it was isolated 
that apparently kills more moths faster but it works best in a 
large moth population and loses effectiveness in sunlight 
coming soon shapiro said is the potion that will make abby the 
gypsy moths nightmare he said laboratory policy bars him from 
disclosing details 
even with all guns blazing against the gypsy moth however 
humans can hope only for a stalemate scientists say 
you can control it but when youre talking about eradicating 
the gypsy moth there aint no such animal shapiro said we do 
a good job with dodo birds and passenger pigeons but theres 
virtually no insect thats been eradicated 
a french political exile etienne leopold trouvelot imported 
the pest from france to produce a diseaseresistant strain of 
silkworm in 1868 or 1869 the moth escaped into trouvelots back 
yard in medford by 1923 the moth had spread throughout new 
england 
the us forest service which fights the largest infestations 
has spent since 1979 an average of 61 million a year to fight the 
moth said ken knauer the agencys assistant director of forest 
pest management 
in the fiscal year ending in september the forest service will 
spend 136 million knauer said officials are telling congress 
they will need about 153 million in the next fiscal year 
with the expanding area of the gypsy moth we doubt that ever 
again will we be spending less than 6 million knauer said

president patricio aylwin has ordered 
former military ruler augusto pinochet to hand over records of the 
disbanded secret police and told the general to keep the army out 
of politics 
after the meeting monday pinochet told reporters he would 
provide the necessary information but later denied holding any 
such records 
what files i dont have any said pinochet who still 
commands the countrys 60000man army 
he was summoned to the government palace monday and then forced 
to face taunts from demonstrators and shouts of murderer when 
his armored car was denied entrance at the palace gate and he had 
to walk inside 
visibly angry he complained about the treatment to a police 
guard there was no immediate explanation of why pinochets car was 
turned away 
he met with aylwin and defense minister patricio rojas for an 
hour 
a statement issued later by aylwins office said he asked 
pinochet for details on the dissolving of the national information 
center a secret police agency that human rights groups say were 
involved in the torture and killing of dissidents during pinochets 
16year military rule 
the rightwing general took power in a 1973 coup and his 
administration was marked by harsh repression of leftists and 
accusations of human rights abuse 
aylwin won democratic elections in december and took office 
march 11 
according to the government statement aylwin ordered that 
secret police files but put at the governments disposition to 
help prevent and combat terrorism the national information 
center was legally disbanded shortly before pinochet relinquished 
power 
in recent weeks however there have been newspaper reports that 
former secret policemen have been caught conducting surveillance of 
officials of the new government 
the general described the meeting as very cordial very 
friendly and said aylwin asked for his help in fighting 
terrorism the government is hunting for leftist guerrillas 
involved in the recent shootings of some formerly highranking 
military officers 
it was such an agreeable meeting that he invited the armys 
generals to dine with him in june pinochet said speaking to 
reporters as he left his offices in the defense ministry building 
aylwin also complained about the political connotation of an 
army statement that expressed concern about the creation of a 
special commission to investigate human rights abuse during 
pinochets rule 
aylwin told pinochet the army had no authority to question the 
panels creation and should be trying to cooperate with it 
according to the statement 
pinochet replied he didnt mean to question aylwins authority 
although he had reservations about the investigation the 
presidents statement said he expressed the armys willingness 
to cooperate the statement said 
pinochet left the meeting by a private underground exit 
avoiding reporters he told reporters later however that the army 
statement on the human rights panel was not politically motivated 
it was the first time aylwin had summoned pinochet to a meeting 
the two met at the palace three weeks ago at the request of 
pinochet who then complained about the human rights commission 
pinochet called the december elections after a national 
referendum in 1988 rejected extending his rule to 1997 
however a clause in the 1980 constitution written by 
pinochets administration allows him to remain army commander 
until 1998

soldiers and antigovernment 
demonstrators battled today for control of this oilproduction 
center and at least five people were reported injured including a 
soldier 
initial reports from witnesses said the soldier died after he 
was severely beaten by protesters but according to later 
accounts he was evacuated to libreville the capital in critical 
condition 
gunfire from soldiers backed by armored cars wounded at least 
four demonstrators witnesses said automatic rifle fire and 
explosions of hand grenades could be heard in lowincome areas of 
the city 
soldiers also used tear gas against supporters of the opposition 
gabon progress party and arrested at least 20 people including 
three party leaders trying to negotiate the release of several 
children witnesses said they saw them driven in away in military 
vehicles 
the fighting began last week with the death of an opposition 
leader and oil companies drastically cut production gabon earns 
80 percent of its income from oil and would quickly run out of 
money without it 
president omar bongos government imposed a state of siege 
monday night throughout port gentils province and sent troops in 
today to restore order 
in paris today the stateowned oil company elfaquitaine 
announced it would gradually resume production on its 60 offshore 
rigs production was expected to reach half of the 101000 barrels 
normally produced per day and climb to 80 percent wednesday a 
company spokesman said 
security forces began moving into port gentil at dawn sweeping 
away barricades set up by protesters initially there was no sign 
of resistance from opposition party supporters whose leaders urged 
them to put away their weapons mostly hunting rifles 
the trouble began may 23 with the stillunexplained death of 
joseph rendjambe secretarygeneral of the opposition gabon 
progress party in the capital libreville his party members rioted 
in several cities and took control of much of port gentil burning 
the french consulate and taking some expatriate oil executives 
hostage for several hours 
the french government sent reinforcements to its garrison in the 
former french colony when the troops arrived in port gentil the 
hostages were freed 
bongos government had been reluctant to use military force 
against the opposition supporters despite destruction of government 
and private property 
but it acted when elf gabon and shell gabon shut down oil 
production 
before the gabon security forces began their push to take over 
the city french soldiers gathered 1000 expatriate oil workers 
into special centers where they could be protected or evacuated if 
necessary nearly all wives and children of the workers already had 
been evacuated and a further 40 to 60 reportedly were flown out 
today 
most of the expatriates were french but their numbers also 
included british belgian dutch and american workers 
oil company executives said they had been forced to shut down 
oil production because of threats from the opposition party 
supporters the decision angered bongo who threatened to look for 
other oil companies if production wasnt resumed

the justice department today asked the 
independent counsel investigating former housing secretary samuel 
r pierce jr to investigate fresh allegations of political 
favoritism at the agency 
attorney general dick thornburgh made the request in a may 25 
letter to independent counsel arlin m adams a copy of the letter 
was released today by the justice department after it was received 
by adams 
in his letter thornburgh asked the courtappointed independent 
counsel to review allegations of favoritism in the operation of the 
department of housing and urban developments urban development 
action grant program and the secretarys discretionary fund for 
technical assistance and special projects 
the request for adams to broaden his inquiry was based on a 
review of testimony recently given to a house subcommittee by 
dubois gilliam former deputy assistant hud secretary for program 
policy development and evaluation according to the letter 
gilliam who is serving an 18month sentence for conspiracy and 
accepting illegal gratuities told a house subcommittee that pierce 
told him on several occasions to award hud grants to projects that 
were supported by influential republicans 
gilliam who operated the udag program said pierce ordered him 
to ordered to approve a 23 million grant for an apartment complex 
and shopping center on land owned by hampton university where 
pierce was a trustee 
gilliam told the house government operations subcommittee in 
testimony earlier this month that pierce told him to intervene in 
projects in cleveland miami and nashville 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian said gilliams 
testimony about the operation of hud during the reagan 
administration was reviewed by prosecutors in the criminal division 
in his letter to adams thornburgh said gilliams allegations 
concerning how the funding decisions in these programs were made 
are related to the allegations you are already investigating 
concerning huds moderate rehabilitation program 
adams said in a statement that it would appear that in light 
of gilliams testimony it may be appropriate to redefine the 
mandate of the independent counsel 
i shall of course carefully consider this letter from the 
attorney general during the next few days and take action 
promptly said adams who noted he received the letter today 
adams was appointed by a special court earlier this year to 
investigate allegations that pierce and top aides defrauded the 
government by awarding moderate rehabilitation program grants on 
the basis of political favoritism between 1984 and 1988 
the narrow jurisdiction was sought by thornburgh following 
hearings last year by the same house subcommittee chaired by rep 
thomas lantos dcalif 
democrats in congress have repeatedly asked thornburgh to expand 
the scope of adamss jurisdiction 
gilliams testimony given under a grant of limited immunity 
from prosecution conflicts with pierces sworn assertions to the 
subcommittee that he never ordered aides to approve specific grants

candidates supported by the solidarity 
trade union held a strong lead over the communists in community 
council elections across the nation according to unofficial 
returns reported today 
preliminary results from the national general election 
commission indicated that solidarity candidates swept 59 of 60 
seats in the baltic port of gdansk where the union was founded 
nearly a decade ago 
candidates backed by the union also were reported to be doing 
well in the large cities of warsaw krakow katowice and 
czestochowa in the first free elections for local councils since 
world war ii 
there were 52000 individual races for seats on more than 2000 
councils and the official results were to be announced wednesday

won two seats in the cities of kielce and czestochowa four in 
opole six in lodz and 15 out of 341 seats in warsaw according to 
the unofficial returns

stayed away because of confusion over the large number of parties 
running candidates 
nearly 80 new parties have been formed in the last six months 
but many have not presented clearly defined programs 
the most organized political force in the country is the local 
citizens committees founded a year ago by solidarity supporters to 
contest elections 
they faced competition in some areas 
a group representing ethnic byelorussians won a majority of the 
vote in the town of bialowieza and about 25 percent of the vote in 
two other towns in the northeastern province of bialystok not far 
from the soviet border 
the confederation for an independent poland a small 
anticommunist group that has been politically active for a decade 
won three council seats in the city of lublin one in katowice and

pimamaricopa indian community in arizona of the authority to 
prosecute a california man accused of fatally shooting a

to prosecute nonindians for crimes on reservations when the tribes 
accepted the federal governments protection 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented

parsimonious view of the sovereignty retained by indian tribes 
albert duro a member of the torresmartinez band of cahuilla

east berlins mayorelect said today he wants 
three city council members from west berlin in his government a 
move that would strengthen new ties between the longdivided cities 
tino schwierzina said there were no legal bars to his plans 
even though the four victorious world war ii allies still have 
ultimate control over berlin the united states soviet union 
france and britain are expected to relinquish that power as the 
german states proceed with unification plans 
schwierzinas plan would be one of the most significant steps 
toward reuniting the berlins since the berlin wall was opened on 
nov 9 
however the plan may face trouble in east berlin where 
schwierzina a social democrat has agreed on a governing coalition 
with the conservative christian democratic union 
the christian democrats are expected to object because 
schwierzina wants two officials from west berlins social 
democratic party and one from the leftist alternative list 
the christian democrats are the opposition party in west berlin 
and have tight links with their counterparts in east berlin 
likewise the social democrats in both cities also have close 
ties 
schwierzina named as possible candidates west berlin finance 
sen norbert meisner construction sen wolfgang nagel and 
education sen sybille volkholz 
the three have already said they are ready to work for both city

evoking the image of londons bobbies the interior 
minister has suggested that most french police officers do not need 
to carry guns police unions are aghast saying french crooks dont 
share the english sense of fair play 
why not demand the disarmament of the whole planet asked 
bernard deleplace leader of the largest police union at a news 
conference tuesday 
in our latin countries the criminals are betterarmed than 
the police he added 
interior minister pierre joxe ignited the controversy monday 
with a spontaneous comment during a discussion about proposed 
legislation affecting frances 10000 municipal police 
joxe said he not only agreed with a proposal to disarm these 
officers but also believed that a vast majority of the 120000 
members of the national police force had no need to carry arms 
to back his argument joxe cited the example of london where 
only 2552 of the 26800 police officers are authorized to carry 
guns 
all major police unions responded to the comments with surprise 
and alarm 
when the crooks have learned english fair play then maybe 
well see said a spokesman for a union of detectives crime 
isnt going to decrease and we mustnt disarm the police 
roger chaix former director of the national intelligence 
service rejected joxes comparison with london 
crime doesnt have the same characteristics in britain as in 
france where unfortunately there is extremely violent crime he 
told the newspaper le figaro 
according to union estimates weapons are carried by most of the 
80000 uniformed officers in the national police force and 95 
percent of them would oppose disarmament

called the segeneyti front 30 miles from asmara 
the broadcast gave no details referring only to a strong 
offensive that also routed enemy soldiers who arrived in 
support

government victory over tigrean rebels in central ethiopia the 
newspapers said government soldiers killed 1450 rebels of the 
tigre peoples liberation front in fighting for control of a 
strategic mountain pass 
there was no way to verify either of the claims 
the eritreans seek independence for the northern province of 
eritrea a former italian colony they captured the red sea port of 
massawa on feb 8 and cut off all but air access to asmara

tigre rebels around debre lebanos 50 miles north of the capital 
a large number of terrorist bandits was captured and sizeable 
caches of heavy and light arms and equipment seized the 
newspapers said

sources said the battle was friday and saturday it was in the same 
area where the tigreans said they annihilated two government 
battalions earlier in the week 
debre lebanos lies on a pass through a mountain range and 
controls the main road from addis ababa northwest to gojam the

education and business including a controversial stand against a 
movement for total divestment of the universitys holdings in 
stocks of companies doing business in south africa 
among his challenges he headed the school during sometimes 
violent antivietnam war demonstrations and negotiated with black 
students and professors arguing over the years for better minority

scenes to maintain traditions at harvard which celebrated its

tortoises tend to move rather slowly 
but the brookfield zoos was so slow on its annual trek to its 
summer quarters that its keepers had to call a cab 
the 450pound tortoise named peter has taken the quartermile 
walk from the reptile house to an outdoor yard every memorial day 
for at least 17 years 
peter and its keepers set out monday at about 1030 am 
but by 1245 pm peter had covered only about 30 yards said 
zoo spokeswoman hannah jennings 
some plants distracted him and he stopped to eat them 
at 115 pm the keepers gave up loaded peter onto a truck and 
hauled him the rest of the way 
the tortoise from aldabra island in the indian ocean was 
brought to the zoo as an adult and is estimated to be 40 to 60 
years old said joyce peterson senior keeper at the reptile house

radical reformer boris n yeltsin triumphed over 
opposition from mikhail s gorbachev to win the presidency of the 
largest soviet republic today in what he called russias social 
economic and spiritual rebirth 
after three hardfought ballots in the 1060member russian 
congress of peoples deputies yeltsin won 535 four more than the 
majority he needed russian premier alexander vlasov received 467 
ballots 
yeltsin now poses a substantial challenge to gorbachev who 
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country president of the 
soviet union and general secretary of the soviet communist party 
however gennadi gerasimov spokesman for the soviet foreign 
ministry said yeltsins election could strengthen gorbachevs 
campaign for economic reforms 
yeltsins victory is an expression of general discontent with 
how things are going in the soviet unions biggest republic 
gerasimov told reporters at the united nations in new york 
the soviet union is a democracy so we accept what the russian 
parliament has decided it may be a blessing in disguise president 
gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right and 
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the 
left he said 
igor malashenko foreign policy advisor to the communist party 
who accompanied gerasimov at the news conference agreed 
this victory of yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem 
for gorbachev malashenko said yeltsin is also a reformer 
although he reflects concepts which are different from gorbachev 
in this respect i believe it the election can strengthen the 
cause of reform in the soviet union today many people blame 
gorbachev for problems and now they have another person to blame 
after the election result was announced in the grand kremlin 
palace the burly 59yearold yeltsin strode to the podium 
received warm applause and cheers from fellow lawmakers and was 
handed a bouquet of flowers 
yeltsin said he felt a certain satisfaction but at the same 
time i have much more a feeling of responsibility at this turning 
point for russia and the country 
i pledge not to spare anything health or time to do 
everything to get out of this crisis and lead russia to better 
times yeltsin said in his victory speech 
he called the day the beginning of the road to russias 
social economic and spiritual rebirth the way out of the crisis 
and toward the blossoming of russia as a sovereign independent 
government in the framework of our union 
gorbachev actively opposed yeltsins election telling the 
russian congress last week that his platform of moving political 
and economic power from central to local authorities would lead to 
a breakup of the union 
the russian federation is by far the largest of the 15 soviet 
republics stretching from the baltic sea in the west to the 
pacific ocean in the east it is home to onehalf the countrys 285 
million people and includes moscow 
as the president of russia yeltsin will have a highly visible 
platform from which to wage his campaign for more radical reforms 
than those pursued so far by gorbachev 
the victory marks an amazing comeback for yeltsin less than 
three years ago he was reviled in the soviet press attacked by 
party officials rebuffed by his former mentor gorbachev and 
considered finished politically gorbachev had brought yeltsin to 
moscow to head the citys communist party but he was fired in 1987 
after showing little reverance for party hierarchy 
yeltsin however made his rift with gorbachev work for him 
the popular and outspoken yeltsin had lost the second round of 
voting on saturday by just 28 votes he lost the first round friday 
with 497 ballots to 473 for krasnodar regional communist party 
chief ivan polozkov 
he was nominated again monday and faced vlasov who had 
gorbachevs support and valentin tsoy a littleknown businessman 
from the soviet far east who received 11 votes 
after his election yeltsin walked through the kremlin grounds 
with reporters and wellwishers after passing through the spassky 
gate he was joined by more supporters 
thank you thank you for our future one man shouted 
yeltsin mounted the steps of an embankment below the kremlin wall 
for an impromptu speech to supporters who rushed across the 
cobblestone street to shouts of victory yeltsin pledged to 
work for a renewed russia the crowd pledged support 
were prepared to go together with him into tough times 
everyone says that one crowd member nadezda matveyeva said 
during his campaign yeltsin called on the congress to reject 
the kremlins new program for gradually transforming the countrys 
crippled centrally planned economy to a partial market economy 
the congress must take the citizens of russia under its 
defense he said the reform program which would triple the 
price of bread on july 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs 
starting jan 1 caused panic buying that prompted moscow city 
authorities to bar sales to nonresidents of the capital 
gorbachev who left moscow today for a washington summit went 
on national television sunday night to try to calm fears but 
anxiety is high and the list of items being rationed is on the rise 
yeltsin has broadly outlined a plan that would more rapidly seek 
a transition to a marketbased economy giving more freedom to 
enterprises and entrepreneurs 
lawmakers said monday they believed yeltsins offer of a 
coalition government in the republic bolstered his chances to win 
todays round 
discontent over the governments economic program also boosted 
yeltsins campaign said one of his backers lawmaker leonid 
gurevich of murmansk 
some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people 
could lose their jobs as a result of the central governments 
reforms expected to drive many inefficient businesses into 
bankruptcy 
under the threestep reform plan to be implemented through 
1995 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public 
sector and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices

a soviet admiral tuesday confirmed that a 
nuclear submarine suffered a mishap near norway in december but he 
denied reports that it leaked radiation 
the soviet youth newspaper komsomolskaja pravda reported in 
february that a mikeclass submarine spread radioactive 
contamination after a reactor or atomic missile accident 
i can confirm that a nuclear submarine was involved in a 
mechanical failure situation but it made it to land under its own 
power there was no danger for the crew or of a radiation leak 
said adm aleksi sorokin at a news conference in the soviet embassy 
our youth newspapers sometimes sensationalize things said 
sorokin who was in norway visiting military bases and meeting with 
government leaders 
he said the accident occurred 345 miles from land in an area 
between the barents sea and the norwegian sea but gave no 
details 
norway a member of the nato alliance has complained that the 
soviets failed to issue adequate warnings in three other accidents 
aboard nuclear submarines last year 
in the worst previous accident a mikeclass submarine sank in 
the norwegian sea on april 7 1989 killing 42 soviet sailors 
foreign ministry spokeswoman sigrid romundset said the december 
incident was probably not serious enough that we would expect to 
be informed

house speaker thomas s foley received 32000 
in speaking fees last year according to house financial disclosure 
forms made public today 
foley dwash donated 5000 of the honoraria to charity in 
1988 when he was house majority leader foley accepted 34750 in 
speaking fees 
foley also got a healthy boost in salary when he was elected 
house speaker to succeed rep jim wright dtexas a year ago after 
wright was forced to resign foleys salary half a year as 
majority leader and half as speaker was 107034 he also 
reported receiving 26462 on the sale of various stocks managed by 
a blind trust 
all house members were required to submit the financial 
disclosure forms which listed assets and liabilities as well as 
income from salaries and outside sources and gifts senate 
financial disclosure forms will be made public wednesday 
the house democratic leadership last year underwent a traumatic 
shift as a result of the resignations of wright and rep tony 
coelho dcalif both of whom were caught up in allegations of 
financial irregularities 
but the scandals that brought about the leadership changes 
prompted no differences in attitudes toward accepting speaking fees 
from various groups 
rep richard gephardt of missouri catapulted into the majority 
leaders post last year accepted 34500 in honoraria and donated 
7500 to charity 
but the speaking fees accepted by foley and gephardt were 
dwarfed by their leadership colleague rep william h gray iii of 
pennsylvania the assistant majority leader gray received 164098 
in speaking fees and gave 139098 to charity 
house members are allowed to keep honoraria totalling up to 30 
percent of their congressional salaries the base salary for house 
members was 89500 
not all benefits that went to house members came from their 
speaking ability 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo received 14000 in 
income from designing jewelry most of it for people in colorado 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee can see all the baseball games he wants he received an 
american league baseball pass from bud selig owner of the 
milwaukee brewers and a national league pass from the late a 
bartlett giamatti who was national league commissioner at the time 
among republican leaders rep newt gingrich of georgia the 
assistant minority leader saw his speaking rise sharply from a 
total of 28550 in 1988 to 67491 last year 
gingrich who came under criticism last year for the royalty 
arrangement on a book he wrote gave 40704 of his honoraria to 
charity 29304 of that to the atlanta zoo 
minority leader bob michel rill received 49300 in speaking 
fees and donated 21540 to charity 
as usual michel an avid golfer listed items received from his 
participation in various charity tournaments including shoes golf 
balls jackets and shirts 
the categories for assets and liabilities were in ranges that 
made it impossible to precisely calculate the wealth of some 
members 
for example amory houghton jr a new york republican who is an 
heir to the corning glass works fortune listed his assets as a 
range from at least 5046937 to more than 7460000 but there 
was no way of estimating how much more than the second figure 
houghton was worth 
rep julian c dixon dcalif chairman of the house ethics 
committee included the income and holdings of his wife betty in 
his form 
mrs dixons dividend income was listed as exceeding 100000 in 
1989 it came from her interest in mir kanonpeideau an airport 
stores partnership and the value of her stock was listed as 
exceeding 250000 
according to previous financial disclosure forms dixons wife 
invested between 5000 and 15000 in the partnership in 1986 
last year dixon listed the value of his wifes investment in the 
partnership at between 100000 and 250000 
as usual rep patricia schroeder dcolo was one of the 
leaders in speaking fees 
schroeder reported accepting honoraria on 72 occasions in 1989 
for speeches writings and television appearances she reported 
keeping 26313 of her total honoraria 500 less than the maximum 
allowed

a freight train derailed near fairbanks 
and spilled more than 100000 gallons of jet and diesel fuel state 
officials said 
the southbound train with more than 50 cars derailed at about 
130 pm monday said arnold polanchek vice president of 
operations for the stateowned alaska railroad corp 
no one was injured in the derailment and the company still was 
investigating the cause polanchek said 
railroad cleanup crews and state department of environmental 
conservation officials were on the scene about 40 miles south of 
fairbanks near dunbar station polanchek said 
the fuel probably would have run into nearby goldstream creek 
were it not for some beaver dams nearby that held it back a state 
environmental official said there were no immediate reports of 
whether any beavers or other wildlife were harmed 
polanchek estimated the spill at 60000 to 80000 gallons but 
paul bateman fairbanks program manager for the state environmental 
department said tuesday that more than 100000 gallons was a more 
accurate estimate 
weve got cars upside down sideways holed on both ends 
theyre in all shape and condition its a mess said bateman 
who spent monday night at the scene he said at least 14 cars were 
leaking polanchek earlier had said 18 tank cars left the track and 
eight or nine were leaking fuel 
by early today pumps and hoses had begun pumping the fuel off 
the ground bateman said broken tanker cars were scattered on both 
sides of the track 
a bulldozer was used to build a temporary earthen dike around 
the spill polanchek said 
it should all be contained it hasnt gotten to any moving 
water he said 
the fuel was on its way to anchorage from the mapco alaska 
petroleum inc refinery in the town of north pole near fairbanks 
the alaska railroad was purchased by the state from the federal 
government in 1985 it runs one freight train northbound and one 
train southbound daily 
passenger trains also make the run between anchorage and 
fairbanks serving the denali national park and preserve where 
mount mckinley is located

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may impose mandatory life sentences without 
possibility of parole for people convicted of possessing large 
amounts of drugs 
the justices said they will study the appeal of ronald harmelin 
convicted in oak park mich of possessing more than 650 grams of 
cocaine 
harmelin contends that his life sentence without possibility of 
parole violates the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual 
punishment 
michigan courts rejected that contention 
the justices were told michigan is the only state that imposes 
such a mandatory sentence but if the state sentencing law is 
upheld other states might follow michigans lead in their fight 
against drug use 
oak park police stopped harmelins car for going through a red 
light may 12 1986 police found more than a pound of cocaine when 
they searched the cars trunk 
the appeal acted on today attacked harmelins conviction as well 
as his sentence but the justices said they were limiting their 
review to the sentence 
in other words they left intact harmelins conviction 
the appeal said there is no other crime in michigan for which 
the punishment is mandatory life without parole except for 
firstdegree murder 
a person with a long criminal record could commit the foulest 
of atrocities hacking off limbs or poking out eyes of children or 
attempting to assassinate public officials without even the 
possibility of receiving a sentence as high as ronnie harmelin 
the appeal said 
the appeal added this mandatory sentence law does nothing to 
deter the real drug kingpins nor does it help protect society from 
drugs 
but michigan prosecutors defended the sentence as they urged the 
justices to reject harmelins appeal 
while the defendant portrays himself as an innocent and 
misguided individual with no prior record it is clear that he 
possessed well over 650 grams of cocaine some of which was 
individually packaged for apparent resale the state prosecutors 
said 
they noted that he also possessed other drugs a gun and a 
beeper 
but harmelin was not convicted of distributing drugs or of 
possession of drugs with intention to distribute 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a michigan appeals court spent two sentences rejecting 
harmelins constitutional challenge to his sentence 
defendants last claim is that the mandatory sentence of life 
imprisonment is entirely out of proportion to the seriousness of 
his crime and constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment proscribed 
by the us constitutions 8th amendment and the state 
constitution we disagree the appeals court said 
it cited a previous state appeals court ruling for that 
conclusion 
the michigan supreme court refused to hear harmelins appeal 
last jan 29 
the case is harmelin vs michigan 897272

the supreme court agreed today to review 
federal regulations that bar governmentfinanced family planning 
clinics from counseling about abortion 
critics of the regulations issued by the reagan administration 
in 1988 allege they violate freespeech and abortion rights 
at stake is the future scope of a federal program with a 200 
million yearly budget the program funds over 4000 clinics serving 
some 5 million lowincome women nationwide 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide whether states may impose mandatory life 
sentences without possibility of parole for people convicted of 
possessing large amounts of drugs 
the justices said they will study the appeal of ronald harmelin 
convicted in oak park mich of possessing more than 650 grams of 
cocaine 
broadened the protection against double jeopardy saying that 
a motorist who pleads guilty to drunken driving in a fatal accident 
may not be prosecuted later for homicide 
the 54 ruling in a case from new york extends socalled double 
jeopardy protection against multiple prosecutions for some criminal 
defendants the court said someone convicted of a relatively minor 
offense generally may not be retried on more serious charges based 
on the same alleged conduct 
rejected an appeal by two ku klux klan groups and four men 
ordered to pay more than 800000 for organizing a demonstration 
that turned into a violent attack on civil rights marchers in 
georgia 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
punitivedamages award did not violate the freespeech rights of 
the kkk and its sympathizers 
increased the federal governments power to keep some criminal 
defendants behind bars while they await trial even if a key bail 
law was violated 
the justices by a 63 vote spared the government from having 
to free on bail some defendants deemed to be dangerous or a risk to 
flee before trial 
refused to revive a lawsuit in behalf of a child abused after 
illinois officials placed her isn the home of her aunt and uncle 
the court without comment turned away arguments that public 
officials should not be shielded from federal suits when they 
knowingly expose children to abuse in foster homes 
a federal appeals court in new york upheld the ban on abortion 
counseling but other federal courts ruled it is unconstitutional 
the high courts decision expected sometime in 1991 should 
resolve the conflicting rulings 
the family planning program enacted by congress as title x of 
the public health service act pays for creating and operating 
family planning clinics the 1982 law forbids clinics to use the 
federal money to perform abortions but initial regulations let the 
clinic staffs tell women about the abortion option 
after those regulations drew fire from antiabortion groups the 
government barred clinics from using federal money to advise women 
that abortion is an option or to refer them to abortion clinics 
the newer regulations say federally funded clinics may not 
encourage promote or advocate abortion as a method of family 
planning or distribute written materials on abortion 
the regulations also require a family planning clinic that 
receives federal money to keep physically and financially separate 
any abortion clinic it might operate without federal money 
if a woman visiting a federally funded family planning clinic 
asks about abortion doctors and counselors are barred from saying 
more than that the program does not consider abortion an 
appropriate method of family planning and to offer help in 
obtaining prenatal care 
new york state and new york city officials the directors of two 
family planning clinics planned parenthood and other organizations 
challenged the 1988 regulations in federal court the same day they 
were issued 
the lawsuit contended the regulations go far beyond the 
restrictions imposed by the 1982 law and that they impermissibly 
interfere with freedom of speech and womens choice to obtain 
abortions 
us district judge louis l stanton in new york city upheld the 
regulations and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals agreed by a 
21 vote last nov 1 
after stating that the regulations are consistent with the 1982 
law the appeals court ruled that the regulations do not violate 
any constitutional right of pregnant women or family planning 
clinic staff members 
the government has no constitutional obligation to subsidize 
an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally 
protected the appeals court said the government may validly 
choose to favor childbirth over abortion and to implement that 
choice by funding medical services relating to childbirth but not 
those relating to abortion 
n the appeal acted on today challengers said the federal 
regulations represent a kind of viewpoint discrimination 
because these regulations require the provision of 
misinformation they do more than encourage childbirth rather they 
constitute a direct interference with a protected activity the 
appeal said 
women who have come to rely on title x for medically sound 
advice will be misled the silence of a trusted doctor on the 
subject of abortion will lead many women to believe that abortion 
is not an appropriate or medically indicated option for them the 
appeal added 
bush administration lawyers although contending that the 2nd 
circuit court was right urged the justices to review the case to 
resolve conflicting rulings 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled last 
march that the regulations are unconstitutional so did a federal 
judge in colorado 
the cases are rust vs sullivan 891391 and new york vs 
sullivan 891392

an agreement to expand and possibly 
quadruple commercial air travel between the united states and the 
soviet union is ready for signing at the summit while negotiators 
are still working on deeper cuts in nuclear weapons 
the agreement concluded on sunday will expand the travel route 
to involve more carriers and cities and inaugurate regular cargo 
flights between the two countries it represents closer ties 
between the superpowers as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
tries to get a grip on his troubled economy 
in another sign of ussoviet cooperation us officials said 
monday that the soviets had informed the bush administration that 
they would begin dismantling the longdisputed krasnoyarsk radar 
facility in eastern siberia 
the arms negotiations meanwhile resumed today at the state 
department after more than nine hours of talks over the holiday 
weekend they are dealing with projected cutbacks in longrange 
nuclear missiles bombers and submarines as well as a stalemate in 
negotiations to cut troops tanks and other conventional weapons in 
europe 
any announcement will be withheld until the summit margaret d 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
however another us official said none of the strategic arms 
issues had been settled but there was some progress on methods of 
verifying cutbacks in conventional weapons thats good news 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a brief press notice late monday gave no indication whether any 
progress was made any announcement of a breakthrough is expected 
to come from president bush or secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
in any event the two sides already have reached agreement on 
many of the main points of a new treaty to reduce their strategic 
nuclear weapons arsenals a declaration will be issued by bush and 
gorbachev at their fourday summit meeting which opens in 
washington on thursday 
the air travel accord will add four us cities and six soviet 
cities to current airliner routes under an agreement to be signed 
at the summit 
us officials said monday the agreement could quadruple air 
travel between the two countries and for the first time would 
provide regular cargo service it will allow six additional us 
airlines to operate as well as a planned new soviet airline to 
participate in service between the two nations 
only pan am and the soviet airline aeroflot now fly ussoviet 
routes serving new york washington moscow and leningrad 
additional us cities to be provided service are anchorage 
alaska chicago san francisco and miami the new soviet cities are 
kiev minsk magadan khabarovsk tbilisi and riga in latvia 
in addition the two sides agreed to allow at least 100 annual 
charter flights over the north atlantic route and to consider up to 
100 charters across the pacific 
us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
final details involved a compromise on the percentage of rubles 
paid by soviet travelers that moscow will guarantee to convert into 
us dollars 
the united states originally insisted on 15 percent while the 
soviets only wanted to guarantee 65 percent negotiators settled 
on a compromise that 875 percent of the space on us airliners 
flying out of the soviet union would be purchased with rubles 
convertible to dollars 
a number of us carriers have expressed interest in competing 
with pan am for the expanded service including delta united 
alaska air and northwest 
the soviet decision to begin dismantling the krasnoyarsk radar 
facility would overcome one obstacle in the way of the strategic 
arms treaty both the reagan and now the bush administrations have 
said they would not sign a strategic arms reduction treaty until 
the giant radar facility is dismantled 
we recently saw signs that this is going on said one 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the reagan administration had contended the installation 
violated the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which imposes 
strict limits on radar after protesting initially the soviets 
eventually relented and said they would dismantle the facility 
the two countries arms control negotiating teams met in three 
sessions sunday totaling 6 hours and then for 2 hours on monday 
the us delegation was headed by undersecretary reginald 
bartholomew and the soviet group by deputy prime minister viktor p 
karpov an experienced arms control negotiator 
gorbachev sent the negotiators initially to take up a halfdozen 
unsettled strategic weapons reduction issues 
but a us official declining to be identified said the talks 
also dealt with cuts in us and soviet troops tanks artillery 
and airplanes in europe

the people who live in the hillside 
slums of this central asia city have little faith in the latest 
kremlin plan to salvage the economy 
honestly i dont believe anyone anymore said valentina 
bludova 57 she said she was fired from the nearby slaughterhouse 
after she was struck on the head by a falling piece of machinery 
and knocked out 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov last week announced a plan for 
a painful transition to what he called a regulated market in 
which the state will surrender much of its control over the economy 
when muscovites heard they could expect food prices to double 
and widespread layoffs they began buying out the stores 
halfway across the country in kazakhstan near the mountains 
separating the soviet union from china shoppers have not panicked 
however residents expressed little hope in the future they 
predicted the government would have a hard time winning support for 
a program that officials say will entail a twoyear recession 
i dont think it will be any better for me said tamara 
sukhikh 37 who earns 243 a month as a janitor in a packaging 
factory i fear higher prices how can i take care of my family 
mrs sukhikh lives with her husband and two children in one of 
many tworoom shacks built from wooden scraps and tar paper the 
hovels are privately owned but the land beneath them belongs to 
the state 
the rain pours through plywood ceilings of the home built by 
mrs sukhikhs parents just after world war ii half the family 
sleeps on the floor 
a young mechanic lounging along polezhayeza street smoked 
cigarettes with friends in front of his weathered wooden shack that 
houses his wife two children his mother and three other families 
the toilet is outside water is hauled from a communal faucet 
down the steet residents say in the nearly 50 years since the 
shacks were built the authorities have never even mentioned the 
possibility of plumbing 
the mechanic says he gets promises promises promises when 
he asks city authorities for an apartment they take our 
documents and later they give them back he said refusing to 
give his name 
if they would let me buy land i would build a house and a 
garden he said 
one of the governments announced reforms would allow the people 
of this slum and those in millions of shacks and slums throughout 
the country to buy a building lot 
i dont believe it the mechanic said the bureaucrats 
will just take my documents and keep them and do nothing 
as it is he doesnt even dare repair the leaky roof of his 
shack if i did they would ask where did you get the material 
and give me a fine he said 
mrs bludova the former slaughterhouse worker ran afoul of the 
bureaucrats when she took the housing situation into her own hands 
a widow who says she was abandoned by her second husband when 
she was unable to bear children she bought a shack just big enough 
for a stove and a table she paid 10000 rubles thats 16600 at 
the official rate or roughly six years salary not including the 
land 
scrounging a board here and there she gradually added 2 rooms 
herself i lived well she said proudly 
she soon discovered however that she needed permission for 
each improvement and she found that the woman who had sold her the 
house who is now dead had not transferred the documents into her 
name 
the bureaucrats discovered this and yelled and yelled at me 
and i broke down in tears and ran away she said 
now she fears any attempts to better her living conditions will 
bring her back to the attention of the authorities 
after decades of promised reform the slum dwellers arent the 
only ones in alma ata who have grave doubts about the governments 
economic plan 
if the economists cant make up their minds what to do how 
can i decide if their are right asked murlan zhanobilov a 
lawyer with the kazakh supreme court 
legalization of private land would help he said but nobody 
believes that without a guarantee that if we build a threestory 
house it wont be taken away nobody will believe it he said 
shaking his head 
soviet citizens remember the millions who died in the 
collectivization drive of the 1930s for the crime of being owners 
of private farms in kazakhstan memories are fresher 
five million of the republics 16 million people came to its 
remote steppes when stalin forcibly deported whole nationalities in 
the 1940s zhanobilov said 
alma ata authorities confiscated homes as recently as three 
years ago he said 
bureaucrats said it was part the campaign against unearned 
income and converted the houses to kindergartens and other 
institutions he said they told residents prove where you got 
each brick 
since many of the houses were 20 and 30 years old zhanobilov 
said how could they

cbs fall schedule features a revamped prime 
time lineup with seven hours of new programming and a firstrun 
movie package the networks top entertainment executive said today 
this is a strong first step in the process of rebuilding our 
prime time lineup said jeff sagansky president of cbs 
entertainment introducing his first full schedule since taking 
over the job last year 
cbs has been in third place for three consecutive seasons but 
came close to beating frontrunner nbc in the justcompleted may 
sweeps although it did so with a mix of specials and movies that 
preempted its regular programs 
cbs offers four new halfhour situation comedies family 
comedies with breakout star potential and five hourlong dramas 
aimed at attacting more family viewing in the 8 pm to 9 pm time 
period sagansky said 
fox broadcasting co was expected to announce its fall schedule 
late today 
sagansky said cbs will have new shows in the 8 pm to 9 pm 
slots on five nights the firstrun precable movie package 
includes such hits as born on the fourth of july and field of 
dreams he said 
the new sitcoms are the movie spinoff uncle buck the nbc 
castoff hogan family the bluecollar lenny burt reynolds 
in evening shade as a former pro football star who coaches a 
high school team and a widower firefighter raising four children 
in four alarm family 
the five hourlong series include the flash adventures of 
the highspeed superhero wiou about the cutthroat world of 
local television the hammersmiths a comedic and poignant

cbs news shows 60 minutes and 48 hours return to the 
fall schedule along with what was saturday night with connie 
chung 
miss chungs show was given a new format and shifted to monday 
night as face to face with connie chung the show in that 
incarnation got two testruns during the may sweeps and scored high 
ratings 
sagansky played down suggestions that the cbs schedule is not as 
unconventional as that of its two major rivals each of which have 
musicdrama shows and in abcs case the return of the quirky cult 
favorite twin peaks 
what makes a show unconventional is the way its executed not 
cops singing or whatever is behind twin peaks sagansky told 
reporters at a news conference at the cbs broadcast center

soviet pollution is choking finnish 
lapland threatening what is considered europes last wilderness 
scientists say 
some experts predict ecological death for the pristine pine 
forests and arctic tundra in a decade unless quick action is taken 
we are used to drinking water from the lakes and streams in 
lapland but if the pollution continues at current levels i give 
the region 10 years said satu huttunen professor of botany at 
the university of oulu in north finland 
finnish lapland makes up about a third of the country and is 
largely uninhabited by humans home to bears wolves moose and 
other animals it also provides a recreation area for skiers and 
canoeists 
finnish officials say the problem begins with large soviet 
nickel and apatite plants in the kola peninsula that spew out 
770000 tons of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere each year 
most of it falls into soviet territory but foresters in 
northeast finland have reported increasing levels of pollutants 
some of the sulphur concentrations are three times higher than 
the vulnerable arctic nature can tolerate in fact concentrations 
in some finnish cities are lower than in the isolated corner of 
lapland mrs huttunen told the associated press 
last week prime minister harri holkeri visited the soviet 
industries in the region with soviet deputy prime minister stepan 
sitaryan 
it was just plain devastation everywhere you looked for 
kilometers around the trees and vegetation were dead the whole 
place was polluted under heavy black dust said jyrki 
myllyvirta holkeris special assistant 
myllyvirta said sitaryan was visibly shocked by what he saw 
but was unsure how fast the soviets would begin to clean it up 
the two countries have signed an agreement to halve 
transboundary air pollution measured by 1980 levels in the next 
five years 
but we have experienced in the past that there are many 
problems in the soviet union when it comes to applying new 
technology myllyvirta said in an interview 
mrs huttunen and other researchers say that to save lapland 
sulphur emissions must be cut by at least 90 percent without delay 
otherwise there is no hope the pollution levels are much 
higher than any of us believed said researcher jaana 
reinikainen who recently returned from northeast lapland 
we knew of totally destroyed forest areas of some 10 hectares 
25 acres but now we found areas as big as 400 hectares 1080 
acres which were badly damaged mrs reinikainen said 
the finnish outokumpu mining company is negotiating the sale of 
new flashsmelting technology to the soviets that it says would 
reduce sulphur emissions by more than 97 percent 
an outokumpu official said the new technology could be running 
at full capacity in the kola peninsula within three years at a cost 
of 375 million 
press reports said the soviets had rejected outokumpus 
technology in favor of their own myllyvirta denied the reports

two senate committee chairmen on tuesday 
proposed revamping us foreign aid to make it more supportive of 
american business interests overseas 
sens david boren dokla and lloyd bentsen dtexas said a 
larger portion of us economic aid should be tied to purchases of 
american goods and services they proposed legislation to boost the 
figure from the current 7 percent to 40 percent by 1996 
competitors such as japan west germany and france already make 
heavy use of such tied aid they said 
more and more we have come to understand that competition in 
the world today is primarily economic rather than military boren 
said at a news conference he said polls show americans are 
increasingly disenchanted with foreign aid spending 
boren chairman of the intelligence committee said he and 
finance committee chairman bentsen were being joined in the effort 
by sen robert byrd dwva chairman of the appropriations 
committee 
their suggestion is likely to join various ideas for revamping 
foreign aid as congress seeks to adapt a decadesold aid system to 
the new realities of eastern european democracies and collapsing 
centrally planned economies 
many of the ideas reflect a need for aid to be aimed less at 
military security for friendly nations as it has been through the 
cold war era and more at economic warfare 
boren called it a tragic waste that the united states gave 
most of its recent 800 million in aid to poland in cash with no 
strings attached while west germany and japan gave nearly 3 
billion that could be spent only to buy goods from those countries 
i think it is time we adjust to what our economic competitors 
are doing boren said we should offer american goods when 
developing nations are cleaning up their environment and building 
their infrastructure transportation systems communications 
networks and new plants with new technologies 
boren proposed as a safeguard that the shift of aid money not 
penalize the poorest countries particularly those in africa which 
now receive direct grants for programs like public health 
population control and agricultural development 
the proposal also included a 15 percent increase in the ceiling 
for direct loans by the exportimport bank to finance purchases of 
us goods by overseas buyers increases in other credit programs 
tied to purchase of american products and a new 1 billion loan 
guarantee program for eastern europe to encourage an aggressive 
us presence in that new market

the us edition of a private soviet business 
weekly is making its debut this week to coincide with the 
bushgorbachev summit 
the idea is to give practical information and objective 
information which is more or less unusual for the soviet press 
said vladimir yakovlev creator and editorinchief of commersant 
the paper aimed at the soviet and foreign businesses in the 
soviet union started publishing in russian and english in january 
it has a domestic circulation of 350000 and the new 
sovietamerican edition is expected to attract up to 60000 
subscribers at an introductory rate of 165 a year 
commersant covers topics such as the launch and failure of joint 
ventures the accurate but unofficial dollar exchange rate and 
soviet government decisions affecting business 
it was the first to report on the governments planned economic 
reforms 
the paper advises readers about how to start a business where 
in the country it is risky to invest how to attract foreign 
capital and how to invest rubles it will also list stock prices 
when the soviet stock market opens in september 
the front page of a special summit issue says commersant has 
been published since 1908 but was suspended from 1917 to 
1990 for reasons beyond its control 
one piece in the summit issue of commersant compares the soviet 
economy to a cramped leg you can move it neither forward nor 
backward nor can you remain still because of the pain 
asked if he had any competitors yakovlev laughed and said 
not yet but he said he hoped someone would start a daily 
soviet business newspaper allowing him to publish less news and 
more analysis 
yakovlev 31 is founder and chairman of fact his countrys 
largest business databank it employs more than 400 people

the supreme court today effectively extended 
the long arm of the law in the case of a couple who split up and 
now live on opposite coasts 
the justices voting 90 said new jersey resident dennis 
burnham must answer to courts in california in a divorce suit by 
his wife francie burnham 
the court ruled that someone who visits a state may be sued 
there by a state resident even if the visitor has only minimal 
contacts with that state the ruling is likely to have significant 
impact in other divorce and custody cases 
burnham was greeted by a process server in january 1988 when he 
went to california to spend some time with the couples children 
who live with their mother in the san francisco area 
the supreme court said today that burnhams presence in 
california although brief was enough for the california courts to 
have authority over him in the divorce proceeding 
justice antonin scalia in the courts main opinion said 
burnhams due process rights are not violated by forcing him to 
contest his wifes divorce claim in california 
jurisdiction based on physical presence alone constitutes due 
process because it is one of the continuing traditions of our legal 
system that define notions of fair play and substantial 
justice he said 
joining his opinion were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white and anthony m kennedy 
the other five justices agreed that burnhams rights were not 
violated but in separate concurring opinions declined to go along 
with scalias reasoning they supported a casebycase approach 
precluded by scalias broader pronouncement 
the burnhams were married in 1976 and lived in new jersey until 
they separated in july 1987 when mrs burnham took their two 
children to california 
burnham sued for divorce in 1987 in new jersey accusing his 
wife of desertion she said the suit violated their agreement that 
they were splitting up over irreconciliable differences 
when burnham visited his family in january 1988 he took one of 
the children on an outing to san francisco when he returned to his 
wifes home in nearby mill valley he was served with a summons and 
a copy of her divorce petition 
the california courts denied his motion to quash the service of 
process rejecting arguments that he only had minimum contacts with 
the state 
court papers did not specify where burnham lives in new jersey 
the case is burnham vs superior court of california 8944

burmas first competitive election in 30 
years may have given this impoverished nation a chance to start 
anew in building a democratic government 
but skepticism and anxieties persist about how the powerful 
military which has held authoritarian power since 1962 will react 
to the turn of events 
to the surprise of many analysts the countrys leading 
opposition party the national league for democracy appears to 
have scored a huge victory over conservative promilitary forces 
final results from sundays general election may not be in for 
weeks but in votecounting through tuesday the party backed by 
the military had yet to win a single seat in the 492seat 
parliament 
the national league for democracy had won 41 of the 43 
parliamentary seats decided and said it was certain it would hold 
at least 322 seats when counting was finished 
the mood in this city of crumbling british colonialera 
buildings has changed dramatically since the vote 
saturday people dared not take the leaflets i was handing out 
now they talk freely said a party organizer tuesday 
but the future appears unclear the military has promised to 
turn over power after the new parliament writes a constitution and 
a strong civilian government is in place there is no indication 
when this will be achieved 
its still a very murky situation it has never happened 
before and i think the army is still scratching its head and 
wondering how to handle it said one senior western diplomat 
if you look back in history the armys attitude is not firm 
they often change their color do you see the point said an 
official of the national league for democracy who requested 
anonymity 
it was the army that killed several thousand mostly unarmed 
civilians when the country rose up against authoritarian rule in 
1988 
a group of military leaders led by gen saw maung crushed the 
uprising in september 1988 imposed martial law and carried out 
widespread arrests it did call for general elections and for a 
time allowed relatively free political activity 
but when opposition leader aung san suu kyi the charismatic 
daughter of independence hero aung san criticized the military and 
gathered mass support last summer she was put under house arrest 
the coleader of the national league for democracy tin oo was 
also jailed former prime minster nu also remains under house 
arrest 
other political prisoners remain in detention and arrests 
continued until just before the election five days before 
balloting zagana a popular comedian who took part in the 1988 
uprising was sentenced to five years in prison by a military 
tribunal 
given this prelude diplomats human rights organizations and 
others branded the elections fraudulent yet from all available 
accounts including observation by foreign correspondents the 
balloting was free and fair 
the united states praised the burmese for the election and said 
tuesday that from the early results it is apparent the burmese 
people want to return to a multiparty political system 
some analysts speculate that the military miscalculated the 
burmese peoples dissatisfaction with their situation 
they simply did not realize how deeply unpopular the 
promilitary national unity party and by extension they 
themselves were said a rangoonbased western diplomat 
the opposition is taking the election at face value the 
military called an election prodemocracy forces won and now have 
a mandate from the people 
people who until recently did not dare approach foreigners in 
public are speaking freely although they do not always want their 
names printed 
im very happy to see fresh new faces in parliament and im 
glad to see those old cronies who had devastated the economy leave 
the scene said one retired civil servant this election has 
turned a page in burmese history 
this is not the first effort at democracy in modern burmese 
history after independence from great britain in 1962 a 
parliamentary democracy was established 
it scored some successes but factionalism rebellions by ethnic 
groups and other problems plagued the fledgling experiment the 
army stepped in on several occasions and finally seized power in a 
1962 coup led by gen ne win 
ne win and his oneparty state led the country to economic ruin 
isolationism and political stagnation 
ne win retired in 1988 and some say his withdrawal from the 
political arena contributed to the election triumph of the league 
for democracy others believe he is still pulling strings behind 
the scene

a marching band and the cheers of thousands 
of residents created a rousing homecoming today for frank reed who 
spent 3 years as a hostage in lebanon 
the noontime procession officially welcomed reed back to this 
suburb just north of boston where residents never lost hope during 
his 44 months of captivity 
reed and his family led the citys high school band through 
downtown to city hall to the tune of tie a yellow ribbon the 
song that inspired the idea of festooning trees with yellow ribbons 
as reminders of us hostages 
reed 57 was freed by his shiite moslem kidnappers april 30 he 
underwent medical treatment at andrews air force base md until 
the holiday weekend which he spent relaxing with family members in 
malden later he was to return to maryland for continued treatment 
on monday reed recalled in an interview that fellow hostage 
terry anderson once suggested reed would get through the experience 
because he was a realistic optimist anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press has been held captive 
since march 1985 
ive never been a person to go through super highs or super 
lows reed said in an interview ive never been a person to 
get depressed that may have sustained me during the whole ordeal 
bob woolf reeds spokesman repeatedly stopped him from 
answering questions about the six americans and 10 other westerners 
held in lebanon 
on sunday reed said some of the hostages were in ill health 
mentioning anderson 42 and thomas sutherland 59 but giving no 
details 
those comments contradicted statements he made at a news 
conference may 6 when he said anderson and sutherland look 
physically wonderful he said he last saw anderson between a year 
and 18 months ago and sutherland 14 months ago 
asked about the contradiction reed said there is something 
to say and there may be some clarifications to be made before 
he was stopped by woolf 
appearing fit and heavier than when he was released reed said 
his anemia is moving in the right direction he was prevented 
from answering detailed questions about his condition but did say 
doctors had been surprised by how quickly he had regained his 
health he said he had regained almost 20 pounds 
everythings supposed to be wrong with me but the doctors 
keep saying gee it aint there reed said they keep making 
up these superlatives to describe my health 
he attributed his seeming good health to a strong constitution 
inherited from his 91yearold mother leota sprague he saw her 
for the first time in eight years when he arrived at bostons logan 
international airport on sunday 
he said he hopes to complete his doctorate continue his career 
as an educator and perhaps write a book about his experiences 
the thing about suddenly being released is thank god im 
free reed said put me anywhere where i can get my life 
started

president bush and his advisers went over 
final preparations today for a ussoviet summit that a top aide

agreements to sign 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will likely issue 
a statement of progress on nuclear arms reductio as 
sign various cultural and economic agreements when they meet this 
week said a senior admin talks as wellnistration official who briefed 
white house 
reporters 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity cast doubt 
on prospects for a ussoviet trade agreement before gorbachev 
leaves 
were in a rather uncertain state about what exactly will 
happen on the trade agreement the official said citing us 
unhappiness over soviet actions in lithuania and the soviets 
failure to enact legislation allowing free emigration 
still the official said this is not a summit devoted to the 
celebration of agreements that we can sign it is a summit designed 
to do the hard work of trying to overcome the remaining obstacles 
that stand in the way of transforming eastwest relations

arab leaders tuesday decided against 
sending a memorandum on the middle east conflict to the superpower 
summit after moderates failed to temper criticism of washington in 
the draft 
the memorandum mostly on the influx of soviet jews to israel 
had become a focus of discord on how hard a line the arab league 
summit should take against the united states 
there will be no letter iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
said as he emerged from a closeddoor meeting he refused to 
elaborate 
the conference was called as a show of arab unity against what 
president saddam hussein has said is a western and israeli campaign 
against iraq it also sought ways to stem the emigration of soviet 
jews to israel 
little unity however has been apparent so far in the summit 
syria and lebanon boycotted the meeting and morocco algeria and 
oman sent senior government officials 
in bellicose speeches monday iraqi president saddam hussein and 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat blasted 
the united states and israel 
but moderates led by egypt and saudi arabia appeared to have 
persuaded hardliners to take a more balanced and prudent 
approach on the summits second day sources said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the arab 
nations were unable to agree on the wording of a memorandum to be 
sent to the superpower summit which begins thursday in washington 
iraq and the plo drafted an 18page document which focused 
mainly on the emigration issue and called for economic sanctions 
against countries that facilitate the influx it urged western 
nations especially the united states to absorb soviet emigrants 
but egypt and saudi arabia rejected references to sanctions and 
the criticism of us policy 
with the moderate and hardline blocs arguing over every word 
in the 18page draft memorandum they decided to scratch it 
altogether a conference source said 
about 750000 soviet jews are expected to emigrate to israel in 
the next few years and arab states contend many will settle in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip land the palestinians 
consider their own 
many arabs are angry at the united states saying it has added 
to the influx by tightening immigration restrictions and driving 
soviet jews to israel 
the arabs also believe washington has not done enough to 
pressure israel into agreeing to direct peace talks with the plo 
at a closeddoor session tuesday arafat alleged that israel was 
conducting military exercises in the negev desert in preparation 
for an attack against iraqs military installations 
iraq has often said accusations it was producing chemical 
weapons and building a socalled super gun were a prelude to a 
strike similar to the 1981 israeli air raid on a nuclear reactor 
near baghdad 
on monday saddam told the conference he would use weapons of 
mass destruction against israel if the jewish state deployed its 
nuclear arsenal against any arab nation 
he accused the united states of fostering the policy of 
aggression and expansion practiced by the zionist entity against 
the arabs 
iraq is said to have binary chemical weapons britain italy 
greece and turkey recently have confiscated iraqbound shipments 
allegedly containing components of a super gunarab states 
claim israel has 200 nuclear bombs 
the arab summit was originally scheduled to end late tuesday 
but conference sources said the closing session would not be held 
until wednesday

one congressmans life was saved by a 
newspaper a senators marriage gave some midwesterners their first 
look at a democrat and a new president rated a unique greeting at 
the capitol 
while reports of washington street violence seem to abound 
lately its apparently not a new phenomenon 
in 1861 muggers attacked rep charles van wyck rny on a 
street near the capitol one assailant tried to stab the 
congressman but the knife was deflected by the folded pages of a 
newspaper in van wycks pocket 
van wyck decked one mugger then pulled out a pistol to ward off 
others 
most members of congress arent armed these days and few would 
expect their lives to be saved by newspapers 
but many may find similar experiences in a new book 
congressional chronicles the collection of anecdotes compiled 
by anthony s pitch was published by mino publications of potomac 
md 
in it pitch recalls sen j allen frear ddel who had what 
may have been a tense experience 
shortly after his marriage frear went to wisconsin to visit 
friends and relatives of his wife esther who was from a town 
where nearly everyone was a republican 
in the middle of the party frear was asked to stand in the 
middle of the room and his fatherinlaw told those present i 
want you to see and know what a democrat is you probably have 
never seen one before but here is one 
when ronald reagan headed for the capitol after his first 
inauguration the new sergeantatarms howard liebengood asked 
majority leader howard baker rtenn how do you greet these 
people 
watch nordy he knows said baker referring to nordy 
hoffman the retiring sergeantatarms 
but hoffman a 300pound former tackle on knut rocknes 1929 and 
1930 notre dame football teams recalled that actor reagan once 
portrayed george gipp another member of that team 
when reagans limousine pulled up and the door opened hoffman 
extended a hand and said hiya gipper 
many members of congress admit that their staff wields plenty of 
influence getting things done that the members dont have time to 
supervise 
rep norman dicks dwash saw the difference when he was 
elected to the house in 1977 after eight years as an aide to sen 
warren magnuson 
i never thought id give up that much power voluntarily 
dicks said when asked about his new job 
rebecca latimer felton dga holds three senate records set in 
a very brief 1922 career 
appointed before the winner of a special election was seated 
she served the shortest senate term one day the 87yearold also 
was the first woman senator and the oldest person to become a 
member of that body 
rep john taber rny was famous for his impassioned oratory 
particularly when it was about saving money but his voice may also 
have had some medical applications 
taber reportedly bellowed so loudly one day in the spring of 
1940 that rep leonard schuetz dill tottered dazed into the 
cloakroom a few minutes later schuetz recovered his equilibrium 
and realized that he could hear perfectly having suddenly 
recovered from lifelong deafness in his left ear 
george washington bridges was elected to congress as a unionist 
from tennessee in 1860 but was captured by confederate troops 
before he could get to washington bridges eventually escaped and 
was sworn in just a week before his term expired 
a visit to a naval vessel by women is nothing special these 
days but it wasnt the case at the close of world war ii 
reps chase woodhouse dconn reva bosone dutah and a 
female aide surprised the pentagon by accepting an invitation for 
an overnight stay aboard the aircraft carrier midway 
woodhouse asked adm william halsey if the guard posted outside 
their quarters had been there to protect the women or the crew 
youve got to know said halsey that you three are the 
first ladies who ever spent a night on the ship legally 
rep john allen dmiss joined the house in 1895 and said he 
was mighty impressed with the other members 
in a house in which everybody is either a judge or a general 
or a colonel it is quite a distinction to be a private remarked 
allen 
from then on he was known as private john

president bush has given iran information 
supporting his earlier assertion that four iranians missing in 
lebanon since 1982 are dead the white house said on tuesday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the swiss 
government had passed the report on to tehran bush at a news 
conference on may 3 promised to provide the information as a 
gesture of goodwill 
we have made a major effort of collecting information 
fitzwater said essentially the conclusions are the same the 
four individuals they are concerned with are dead 
the four iranians two diplomats a journalist and a driver 
disappeared from beirut during the 1982 israeli invasion of 
lebanon iran in the past has suggested lebanese christian 
militiamen had a role in the abductions 
fitzwater told reporters he had no new information on the 
circumstances of the killings or on the identity of the 
perpetrators the contents of the report were not disclosed 
he said that the united states conferred with the international 
red cross other countries and a lot of private sources that we 
developed in compiling its report to iran 
at his may 3 news conference bush said he hoped providing iran 
with information on the fate of the four missing iranians would 
satisfy tehrans request for a gesture of thanks for its role in 
the freeing of two us hostages at the same time bush said he 
remained firmly against negotiating for the release of the six 
american hostages still being held in lebanon 
we dont put any conditions on giving iran the new 
evidence on the fate of the four missing iranians fitzwater said 
he said the material was turned over to iran within the last 
several days

the legislature confirmed a top general as 
premier during a raucous session tuesday and hundreds of opponents 
fought in the streets with police burned buses and tossed 
firebombs at government buildings 
at least 40 people including 10 officers were reported 
injured police detained 10 people in the rioting which paralyzed 
downtown traffic for more than 12 hours 
two policemen were hospitalized with serious burns from 
firebombs police said 
at the height of the clashes about 600 demonstrators many 
wearing headbands with the slogan oppose military intervention in 
politics fought roving battles with about 5000 riot police near 
the legislative yuan building police used water cannons to try to 
subdue the protesters witnesses said 
what touched off the unrest was the approval of defense minister 
hau peitsun as the next premier legislators approved him by a 
vote of 186 to 27 
the vote was delayed seven hours as 21 members of the opposition 
democratic progressive party stormed the podium kicked their seats 
in disgust and grabbed microphones from lawmakers of the ruling 
nationalist party 
the opposition lawmakers all wearing vests with chinese 
characters reading oppose a soldier leading the cabinet 
occupied voting booths for an hour to prevent nationalist lawmakers 
from casting ballots several voting booths set up as replacements 
were torn down 
at one point legislature speaker liang sujung called in 100 
police officers to restore order 
hau 70 the nations only fourstar general was selected by 
president lee tenghui earlier this month to head the cabinet 
opposition politicians and intellectuals called the decision a 
step backward for democracy on this island 
the nationalists have dominated politics since they fled the 
chinese mainland in 1949 after losing a civil war to communist 
forces in recent years however the nationalists have eased their 
authoritarian grip lifting martial law and allowing the formation 
of opposition political parties 
hau has promised to distance himself from the military once he 
becomes premier but his critics dismiss the claim hau gave up his 
fourstar ranking saturday 
opposition lawmaker chen shuipien called tuesdays vote 
ridiculous and said it ran counter to public opinion 
after the vote about 200 students staged a sitin outside the 
legislative building witnesses said 
the clashes began when about 600 demonstrators tried to break 
through barricades and a wall of police guarding the building 
police with shields surged into the crowd and beat several 
demonstrators with clubs before opening up with water cannons 
witnesses reported 
the crowd dispersed but quickly regrouped and attacked the 
officers with rocks they said 
dozens of protesters then attacked the nearby cabinet building 
where a room was destroyed by firebombs they said 
some protesters ransacked the lobby of the nearby lai lai 
sheraton hotel smashing chandeliers windows and security monitors 
and overturning furniture the hotel closed briefly because of the 
violence 
about 500 protesters later surrounded a police station and 
demanded the release of the detainees witnesses said the 
protesters smashed windows and that the demonstrators and police 
threw rocks at each other 
about 1000 riot police marched in to disperse those protesters 
but many returned later and burned a bus the witnesses said

populist reformer boris n yeltsin won the 
presidency of the largest soviet republic tuesday overcoming 
opposition by mikhail s gorbachev and declaring the start of 
russias social economic and spiritual rebirth 
yeltsins election after three hardfought ballots in the 
congress of peoples deputies of the russian federation poses a 
substantial challenge to gorbachev and may spur more radical 
reforms across the country 
gorbachev who arrives wednesday in washington for a summit 
retains the two most powerful jobs in the country president of the 
soviet union and general secretary of the soviet communist party 
but as president of the largest of 15 soviet republics yeltsin 
will have a highly visible platform from which to wage his campaign 
for more radical reforms yeltsin and other soviet officials said 
they believe his election will help gorbachev push more radical 
reforms 
it may be a blessing in disguise foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady gerasimov told reporters at the united nations in new york 
gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the right and 
possibly it is better to have the election of a critic from the 
left 
yeltsin said at first president gorbachev will react very 
unhappily but then hell gradually get used to this 
inevitability 
the strapping whitehaired yeltsin told reporters that he would 
seek reconciliation with gorbachev and avoid confrontation with 
him so long as it did not hurt russias interests 
gorbachev had brought yeltsin to moscow to head the citys 
communist party but the two men had a falling out in 1987 after 
yeltsin publicly criticized the pace of kremlin reforms they have 
been at odds since then 
after the vote result was announced in the grand kremlin palace 
yeltsin strode to the podium to warm applause and pledged to 
spare nothing health or time to get out of this crisis and 
lead russia to better times 
his bass voice echoing through the hall he called the day the 
beginning of the road to russias social economic and spiritual 
rebirth the way out of the crisis and toward the blossoming of 
russia as a sovereign independent government in the framework of 
our union 
he left through the kremlin gates later to the tumultuous cheers 
of a small crowd of wellwishers chanting victory victory one 
man yelled thank you thank you for the future 
gorbachev strongly opposed yeltsins election he told the 
russian congress last week that yeltsins platform of moving 
political and economic power from central to local authorities 
would lead to a breakup of the union 
the russian federation stretches from the baltic sea in the west 
to the pacific ocean in the east it is home to half the countrys 
285 million people and includes moscow the soviet capital 
as president of the russian congress a newly created body that 
holds the russian federations highest government authority 
yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic and took office 
immediately as the first president of a newly reorganized 
legislature he will play a major role in shaping his powers and 
duties which as yet are unclear 
after three votes in the 1060member russian congress yeltsin 
won 535 votes four more than the majority needed 
russian premier alexander vlasov received 467 votes valentin 
tsoy a littleknown businessman from the soviet far east received 
11 votes 
lawmakers said tuesday they believed yeltsin gained the last few 
votes he needed by offering to form a coalition government with 
members of the conservative communist party bloc and other groups 
yeltsin said he believed he gained several votes because of a 
lastminute push by gorbachev to block his election gorbachev 
reportedly urged delegates at a meeting monday night not to vote 
for yeltsin 
russian deputy alexander liubimov a wellknown tv commentator 
said yeltsins election would force gorbachev to start dealing with 
another strong leader instead of shadows willing to defer to 
him it will be a lesson for him maybe a hard one liubimov 
said 
vitaly churkin a spokesman for foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze said on nbc that yeltsins election might actually 
help gorbachev because gorbachev is for radical reform and he 
needs more popular support for that 
some also said yeltsin may have benefited from the adverse 
reaction to the kremlins proposed program for making the crippled 
soviet economy a partial market economy 
the reform program which would triple the price of bread on 
july 1 and double the cost of other foodstuffs starting jan 1 
caused panic buying that prompted moscow city authorities to bar 
sales to nonresidents of the capital monday 
the national legislature postponed a decision on the reform plan 
tuesday raising the possibility of compromise with yeltsin and 
others demanding more radical measures it also rejected a motion 
for a noconfidence vote in premier nikolai i ryzhkov who 
presented the reforms last week 
yeltsin has proposed a more rapid transition to a marketbased 
economy that would grant more freedom to enterprises and 
entrepreneurs

summertime is tough for jean brissette 
who longs to give her kids the backyard barbecues and baseball 
outings she knew while growing up in an affluent suburb 
today the divorced mother of four is scraping by on 100 a 
week making sure her children have new sneakers means months of 
scrimping 
i figured id have everything my mother had the nice home and 
all that brissette 42 said recently but im robbing peter 
to pay paul and still barely getting by how can i hope to get 
ahead 
she is part of a suburban secret 95 million poor people 
scattered among the nations manicured lawns and backyard 
basketball hoops 
they wont be evident to first ladies barbara bush and raisa 
gorbachev who are coming to this town about 10 miles outside 
boston to deliver a commencement address this week at wellesley 
college 
they are the invisible poor said sheldon danziger a 
university of michigan poverty researcher they are seldom 
discussed 
these people live on the edge of bankruptcy foreclosure and 
life on the streets many have already been pushed off the 
precipice by new englands brokendown economy and inflationary 
cost of living 
like brissette fellow wellesley resident frank g who spoke on 
condition that his familys name not be used measures his life in 
checks paychecks unemployment checks checks from relatives 
lending a hand 
jobs are scarce so the 31yearold construction worker and his 
wife are raising three children on about 600 a month in a town 
where the median home price is about 340000 
im two paychecks away from getting thrown out on the 
streets he said i was treated better in the inner city at 
least there you were on the same wavelength 
his family and brissette and her children live in barton road a 
faded housing project for financially strapped families 
franks wife has to walk two hours round trip with children in 
tow to a supermarket because they have no car and there is no 
public transportation 
residents of wealthy communities are beginning to face pockets 
of despair camouflaged by country clubs and in wellesleys case a 
prestigious womens college 
since 1986 suburban welfare cases have jumped 12 percent 
compared with a 5 percent increase in the number of urban poor 
officials estimate the state has 44000 suburban welfare cases 
just 4000 fewer than in the cities 
more than 28 percent of the 520000 people living below the 
poverty line in massachusetts now reside in suburbia where about 
80 food pantries have sprung up to feed them 
the poverty has been masked for a long time said westy 
egmont executive director of the boston food bank but social 
service providers are documenting the reality 
frank found himself homeless after leaving the navy in 1980 
weve been dirt poor but were a family and thats what its 
all about he said 
franks family moved to wellesley from boston five years ago 
when their number was called for the lowcost housing project but 
the cost hasnt turned out to be that low 
each time frank gets a decent job the rent is adjusted upward 
it has climbed as high as 700 
jobs have been hard to come by and welfare is not for frank who 
is built like a football player and more than ready to work he 
never gives up but being broke gets him down 
its tough when friends say lets go to see the bruins play 
and your priority is in diapers said frank 
living on the edge takes its toll on everyone but its perhaps 
hardest for the children whose schoolmates are dressed in the best 
and riding brand new 10speed bikes 
sometimes they say mean things like your mothers on 
welfare said franks 10yearold daughter janelle 
brissette with two young sons still at home had a stormy 
marriage that ended in a divorce seven years ago 
when the money runs out she joins the line of people seeking 
help from the local food bank things arent at all the way she 
planned 
its a story of incredible pain because of the contrast 
between being poor and living in wellesley said egmont we 
cant escape the fact that we are all marginal

a big bunch of people with big guns will 
protect mikhail s gorbachev during his summit visit a soviet 
spokesman said tuesday saying ethnic protesters could keep the 
kremlin leaders guards busy 
dozens of protests by groups ranging from lithuanianamerican 
war veterans to afghans and turkestanianamericans might become 
a headache for gorbachevs security soviet press spokesman 
vladimir ustimenko said 
neither the us secret service nor the kgb which will work 
together on summit security furnished details of protection 
arrangements on the eve of gorbachevs arrival for his second 
washington summit 
but the soviet leaders freewheeling style in public already 
has been in evidence here and his security detail wants to be 
ready if officials knew of any gorbachev surprises a day before 
his arrival however they werent saying so 
the last time he was here to hold a summit with thenpresident 
ronald reagan in december 1987 gorbachev halted his motorcade to 
take an impromptu walk to meet the local citizenry thenvice 
president george bush riding in the same motorcade jumped from 
his limousine to join gorbachev on the busy washington street 
corner 
the soviet leader also has been known to wade into crowds of 
protesters to carry on political discourse and there will be 
plenty of opportunities for that if he chooses to do so 
they include protests by those representing people in various 
soviet states as well as people favoring a unified korea with a 
south korean leadership there also will be palestinians seeking a 
homeland vietnamese seeking democracy in vietnam and those 
pushing for a cure for aids said maj carl holmberg of the us 
park police 
other demonstrations are scheduled to follow gorbachev as he 
travels to minneapolis and northern california on sunday and 
monday estonians latvians and lithuanians plan a peaceful show of 
their flags in minneapolis and in northern california armenians 
and eritreans plan protests the latter are fighting for 
independence from sovietbacked ethiopia 
the demonstrations have been announced but details of 
gorbachevs stay in washington still were not in the hands of the 
soviet press center or the secret service on tuesday 
all of the roughly 500 us park police officers in the 
washington area were to work through the summit sunday to ensure 
control over the myriad protests planned for lafayette park and the 
ellipse by the white house as well as at the capitol reflecting 
pool holmberg said 
no days off and extended shifts he added 
holmberg expressed confidence that while gorbachev might see 
some protesters they wont get out of control 
weve got some groups to keep an eye on but i dont think 
theyre a grave concern he said 
the number of agents was a state secret on both sides it will 
be a big bunch of people with big guns ustimenko declared 
richard adams of the secret service like ustimenko had no 
specifics to give out 
we have a good idea of what hes going to do but not all of 
the details adams said as far as an impromptu stop thats not 
out of the question 
any sudden decision by gorbachev to get out of his limosine to 
shake hands with the public probably works to our advantage 
adams said 
if we dont know and his staff doesnt know where hes going 
to stop that means someone meaning him harm wont know either 
adams said impromptu stops are not necessarily a negative thing 
to us 
washington dc has been the nations murder capital for the 
past two years but the soviet embassy where gorbachev will stay is 
in a relatively safe part of town near the white house 
there have been no slayings in recent memory in that area said 
metropolitan police department spokeswoman shannon cockett 
to ensure that no untoward events occur there this week the 
entire block will be closed to all traffic through sunday she said 
us security agents and the kgb apparently are working well 
together 
sovietamerican friendship starts with the friendship between 
the soviet kgb and the american secret service ustimenko said 
its hard sometimes for the folks on the outside to understand 
this said adams but from a security point of view we have 
the same goal here the protection of gorbachev 
we have to work closely with them so they understand what 
were doing and we understand what theyre doing adams said 
if our president decides to travel to moscow we would be asking 
for the same cooperation from them and they would provide it

in a decision that will severely restrict 
assistance to 15 million refugees worldwide the united nations 
high commissioner for refugees agreed tuesday to a sharp cut in its 
1990 budget 
the agencys executive committee agreed that expenditure on 
general programs should be limited to 341 million in 1990 in order 
to tackle a financial crisis overwhelming the organization 
in a speech on the opening day of the emergency meeting monday 
deputy high commissioner douglas stafford said a deficit of 82 
million was forecast for 1990 he said overall spending needs were 
estimated at 672 million 
last years general budget was 389 million and in october the 
executive committee proposed a 414 million budget for 1990 
high commissioner thorvald stoltenberg said in an 11page report 
to the meeting that the revised budget was a reasonable balance 
between the needs of refugees and income expected from donor 
governments 
he said said education and support programs were being slashed 
as a result of the financial crisis and that 10 percent to 15 
percent of the 2400 agency employees would be cut 
supplies of food clothing blankets and fuel are being cut to 
inadequate levels in many refugee camps while lack of resources 
for transport and road repairs is imposing further limits on 
supplies according to the report 
the report said refugee protection was also suffering it cited 
insufficient staff to monitor vietnamese boat people in southeast 
asian countries to separate genuine refugees fleeing political 
persecution from those escaping economic hardship 
stoltenberg said cuts in programs to repatriate refugees or 
integrate them into local economies meant people would have to 
remain in camps at great expense 
in 1980 unhcr had twice as many resources for each refugee 
than it has in 1990 stoltenberg said 
the meeting in geneva was held to fix spending for the rest of 
1990 and to make an initial assessment of needs in 1991 all agency 
money is based on voluntary contributions from governments

clintons main challenger tom mcrae former president of the

governor hoped to gain a majority vote and avoid a june 12 runoff 
the other democratic candidates were joe holmes of pine bluff 
jerry tolliver of north little rock cyrus young of fayetteville 
and oo woodrow wilson of north little rock

sen david pryor an arkansas democrat had no primary 
opposition and will face only a writein foe in november 
arkansas republican campaign for governor focused on a business 
deal between arkla inc and arkoma production co owned by 
nelsons friend jerry jones the dallas cowboys owner who grew up 
with robinson in north little rock 
in 1982 arkla sold a halfinterest in gas drilling leases to 
arkoma for 15 million after arkoma spent 35 million more on 
drilling and other costs arkla bought back its leases in 1986 
along with the rest of arkoma for 1748 million 
robinson 48 called the deal sleazy and severed his financial 
ties and friendship with jones jones 22yearold daughter 
charlotte quit her 60000 a year job as administrator of 
robinsons congressional office after robinson began criticizing 
her father 
nelsons feud with his mentor at arkla wr witt stephens 
spilled over into the campaign stephens sisterinlaw mary anne 
stephens managed robinsons campaign her husband jack stephens 
and stephens inc the investment firm run by the brothers were 
major contributors to robinsons campaign 
clinton 43 was the nations youngest governor when he was 
first elected in 1978 he lost his bid for reelection in 1980 but 
was elected again in 1982 1984 and 1986 when the twoyear term 
for governor was doubled 
clinton frequently mentioned as a potential presidential 
candidate became the object of jokes in 1988 because of his 
meandering speech introducing another candidate for that office 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis clinton was supposed to talk 
for 15 minutes but spoke for more than twice that long 
in kentucky gov wallace wilkinson backed brock but 
disagreements between the two surfaced last week when brock decided 
not to follow wilkinsons advice to borrow 250000 for a 
lastminute television blitz wilkinson said that all but dashed 
brocks chances and disassociated himself from the campaign 
alexander 52 claimed that rich landowners in his native 
mississippi county and big oil companies bankrolled gibson 
campaign in a whirlwind push the last two months of the campaign 
the incumbent portrayed himself as a child of the delta and 
boasted of bringing 100 million in federal aide to the 24county 
district 
gibson 43 derided what he said was the incumbents 
ineffectiveness in congress he noted that alexander had never 
chaired or cochaired a major congressional committee 
the main issue in mazzolis district was whether the incumbent 
first elected to the seat in 1970 had done enough for louisville 
in his two decades in office mazzoli was coauthor with sen alan 
simpson rwyo of the 1986 immigration reform law

the united states said tuesday it hoped any 
joint statement emerging from the arab league summit would 
contribute to peace in the middle east 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also said that 
antiisrael statements by iraqi president saddam hussein were 
outrageous 
saddam repeating an april warning told the summit in baghdad 
that iraq would use weapons of mass destruction against israel 
if the israelis used similar weapons against iraq or any other arab 
country 
our view of these statements remains as it was several weeks 
ago theyre irresponsible theyre inflammatory theyre 
outrageous ms tutwiler said 
no one should be trumpeting such weapons meaning chemical 
weapons we should be trumpeting their destruction she said 
repeating messages sent privately and publicly to arab leaders 
ms tutwiler said the united states hoped any resolutions coming 
out of the summit will contribute to peace not raise tensions 
further 
any summit document should support ussponsored efforts to 
bring israelis and palestinians to the negotiating table so 
violence such as that that killed a 72yearold jewish man in a 
jerusalem explosion sunday can be stopped she said 
the conference was called as a show of arab unity against what 
hussein has said is a western and israeli campaign against iraq it 
also sought ways to stem the emigration of soviet jews to israel 
but little unity has been apparent so far in the summit with 
several arab states boycotting the gathering and a decision tuesday 
by the participants to send a memorandum critical of the united 
states to the superpower summit in washington this week

the presidents of iran and iraq may hold 
their first direct meeting in the next few weeks for peace talks to 
formally end the iraniraq war a senior plo official said tuesday 
if the talks take place they would be the first direct 
negotiations between the countries since 1988 when a 
unsponsored ceasefire halted eight years of fighting 
peace negotiations began five days after the truce took effect 
in august 1988 but they quickly deadlocked 
arab officials in baghdad said they believe the threat from 
israel perceived by arab leaders is acting as a catalyst to push 
the foes toward a peace treaty 
the palestine liberation organization official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said plo chairman yasser arafat will fly to 
tehran this week in an effort to set up talks between iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani and president saddam hussein of iraq 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus quoted iranian parliament 
speaker mehdi karrubi also as saying that the two leaders may meet 
but karrubi gave no time estimate he made the comment after saddam 
proposed direct talks in a letter to tehran 
arafat in baghdad for an arab summit that began monday will 
go to tehran immediately after the conference which is expected 
to end by wednesday the plo official reported 
barring lastminute complications direct summit talks between 
saddam and rafsanjani will be under way after a month the 
official added 
according to soviet sources in the iraqi capital saddam sent a 
letter to tehran in april suggesting direct talks soviet envoy 
vladimir petrovsky carried that letter to tehran they said 
the plo official said arafat had sent two messages to iranian 
leaders ayatollah ali khamenei and rafsanjani in recent days 
urging them to respond quickly and positively to saddams offer 
speaking at a news conference in tehran karrubi stressed that 
any talks between rafsanjani and saddam must be within the 
framework of united nations security council resolution 598 which 
resulted in the ceasefire 
the resolution calls for the withdrawal of both sides to 
internationally recognized borders an exchange of prisoners and 
dredging the shattalarab waterway of war debris 
the waterway forms the southern boundary between the two 
countries and is iraqs main outlet to the persian gulf 
iraqs claim over the strategic waterway was the main stumbling 
block in earlier peace talks but according to press reports in 
tehran and kuwait saddam has now conceded that sovereignty over 
the shattalarab is negotiable 
both leaders are under pressure to formally end their war 
iran needs stability to carry out reconstruction and revitalize 
its economy since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini died last june 
tehran has quietly dropped its demands for huge war reparations and 
for an iraqi admission it started the war 
iraq meanwhile needs to reopen its major port at basra on the 
shattalarab which has been closed since the war began it also 
is under domestic pressure to get back its 50000 prisoners of war

new orleans and new york are the finalists in 
the competition to host the 1992 democratic national convention 
party sources said tuesday 
the 46member site selection committee will recommend the two 
cities wednesday to party chairman ronald h brown who will make 
the final decision the sources said 
the convention is scheduled to open july 13 1992 and run for 
four days 
brown plans to visit both cities possibly as early as next 
week and announce his decision in midjune 
the 1988 democratic convention was held in atlanta 
new york was the site of the 1976 convention when the democrats 
nominated jimmy carter for president the last time the party won a 
national election 
new orleans hosted the 1988 republican convention that nominated 
george bush 
in addition to the two finalists the site selection committee 
also considered bids from cleveland and houston 
while cleveland impressed committee members with its 
enthusiastic presentation the city was unable to overcome its 
shortage of hotel space the city planned to house some convention 
participants on boats docked on lake erie 
the democrats insisted on access to the hall for six weeks prior 
to the opening of the convention and also asked for a commitment of 
15 million in support services to include police protection and 
rental of the facility 
those two requirements proved too much for several cities that 
were invited to bid but later declined to enter the competition 
the convention is expected to attract 35000 people to the host 
city and millions of dollars in economic benefits atlanta was 
estimated to have gained about 70 million from the 1988 convention 
that nominated michael dukakis for president 
new york made the strongest financial bid of any city offering 
the democrats 22 million in upfront money and services but 
madison square garden was regarded as only marginally adequate for 
the convention city officials offered a plan to provide additional 
seating but several selection committee members were skeptical 
in addition the media workspace in new york would be in the 
javits center half a mile from the convention site 
new orleans had trouble meeting the financial requirement and is 
located in a state that is considered a stronghold of the 
antiabortion movement placing it at odds with the prevailing 
sentiment of the democratic party but its superdome offered more 
than enough space for the delegates plus the thousands of news 
media needing room to work 
both cities were able to guarantee plenty of hotel rooms and are 
home to some of the nations best known restaurants 
the republicans also have begun their site selection process and 
plan to announce the gop convention site in january

the supreme court said tuesday it will decide 
whether a ban on governmentfinanced family planning clinics 
counseling patients about abortion violates freespeech and 
abortion rights 
at stake is the future scope of a federal program with a 200 
million annual budget the program funds more than 4000 clinics 
serving about 5 million lowincome women nationwide 
a federal appeals court in new york upheld the counseling ban 
but other federal courts ruled it is unconstitutional the high 
courts decision expected sometime in 1991 should resolve the 
conflicting rulings 
in other action tuesday the court 
said it will decide whether states may impose mandatory life 
sentences without parole for people convicted of possessing large 
amounts of drugs 
the court must determine whether such a michigan law the only 
one of its kind in the nation amounts to unconstitutionally 
cruel and unusual punishment 
gave criminal defendants new double jeopardy protection 
against multiple prosecutions as it voted 54 to bar homicide 
charges against a drunken driver in new york 
ruled 72 in a pennsylvania case that convicted criminals may 
avoid making restitution to their victims by declaring bankruptcy 
ruled 72 in a case from arizona that indian tribes may not 
prosecute any member of another tribe for crimes committed on their 
reservations 
let stand a ruling in an illinois case that shields public 
officials from being sued in federal court for placing children in 
foster homes where they are sexually abused 
rejected an appeal by two ku klux klan groups and four men 
ordered to pay more than 800000 for organizing a demonstration 
that turned into a violent attack on civil rights marchers in 
georgia three years ago 
the newest abortion controversy tackled by the court involves a 
family planning program enacted by congress as title x of the 
public health service act it pays for creating and operating 
family planning clinics 
the law forbids clinics to use the federal money to perform 
abortions but initial regulations let the clinic staffs tell women 
about the abortion option 
after those regulations drew fire from antiabortion groups the 
reagan administration in 1988 barred clinics from using federal 
money to advise women that abortion is an option or to refer them 
to abortion clinics 
the newer regulations say federally funded clinics may not 
encourage promote or advocate abortion as a method of family 
planning or distribute written materials on abortion 
the regulations also require a family planning clinic that 
receives federal money to keep physically and financially separate 
any abortion clinic it might operate without federal money 
if a woman visiting a federally funded family planning clinic 
asks about abortion doctors and counselors are barred from saying 
more than that the program does not consider abortion an 
appropriate method of family planning and to offer help in 
obtaining prenatal care 
new york state and new york city officials the directors of two 
family planning clinics planned parenthood and other organizations 
challenged the 1988 regulations in federal court the same day they 
were issued 
the lawsuit contended the regulations go far beyond the 
restrictions imposed by the 1982 law and that they unduly 
interfere with freedom of speech and womens choice to obtain 
abortions 
us district judge louis l stanton in new york city upheld the 
regulations and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals agreed by a 
21 vote nov 1 
after stating that the regulations are consistent with the 1982 
law the appeals court ruled that the regulations do not violate 
any constitutional right of pregnant women or family planning 
clinic staff members 
the government has no constitutional obligation to subsidize 
an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally 
protected the appeals court said the government may validly 
choose to favor childbirth over abortion and to implement that 
choice by funding medical services relating to childbirth but not 
those relating to abortion 
in the appeal acted on tuesday challengers said the federal 
regulations represent a kind of viewpoint discrimination 
we are hopeful the supreme court will overturn the appeals 
courts very harmful ruling said eve paul planned parenthoods 
vice president for legal affairs 
the regulations would force many clinics to go out of business 
because they could no longer provide medically ethical advice to 
their patients fewer women would get contraceptive advice and the 
result would be more women would seek and obtain abortions she 
said 
diana gurieva president of planned parenthood of new york city 
said as policy the regulations are both shortsighted and 
selfdefeating 
bush administration lawyers although contending that the 2nd 
circuit court was right urged the justices to review the case to 
resolve conflicting rulings 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled in 
march that the regulations are unconstitutional so did a federal 
judge in colorado

improved teaching wont mean better schools 
until curriculum changes are coupled with broader early childhood 
health screenings advocates said tuesday 
we need to be dealing with the whole child youre not going 
to have an educated child until you have a healthy child said 
lawton chiles a former senator from florida and chairman of the 
national commission to prevent infant mortality 
his comments came at a news conference that kicked off a twoday 
symposium designed to persuade health and education professionals 
to work more closely 
nobody is looking at the whole child said william s 
woodside a new york city businessman who chairs the board of the 
institute for educational leadership weve got programs out 
there but nobody asks how are all these programs dealing with 
the children 
the organizations headed by chiles and woodside form the 
national healtheducation consortium 
chiles said a third of the nations schoolage handicapped 
children have problems that could have been corrected in their 
early years part of the problem he said is that existing 
programs are under funded and serve too few 
were talking about doing something about curriculum but if 
you dont do something on the front end none of that will make any 
difference he said 
while expanded programs might require greater financial 
commitments from federal state and local governments chiles said 
the net result is a shifting of costs because children who remain 
in school are more likely to pay taxes and less likely to need 
public assistance or end up in prison 
woodside said the longterm savings could be five times as much 
as the cost 
conference participants discussed how a childs learning 
potential is affected by factors ranging from premature birth low 
birth weight and substance abuse by the expectant mother to 
perinatal preschool and schoolage health screenings

boris n yeltsin has embarrassed president mikhail 
s gorbachev again by transforming popular support into a political 
office despite a highlevel campaign against him 
the prize this time was the presidency of the soviet unions 
largest republic the russian federation 
yeltsins victory tuesday in the republics congress of peoples 
deputies presents a formidable political challenge for gorbachev 
who invested his own political clout last week in a rare public 
browbeating of yeltsin 
the 59yearold yeltsin confronted gorbachevs program of 
moderate reforms with a sweeping call for a more radical steps 
including devolution of political and economic decisionmaking from 
central to local authorities 
gorbachev told the russian parliament last week that yeltsins 
call for russian sovereignty was an attempt to cut russia off 
from socialism 
those words may have slowed the rise of yeltsin who passed the 
531vote majority he needed only after three ballots but they did 
not prevent his ascendancy into a leadership position from which 
gorbachev cannot fire him 
gorbachev who retains the top kremlin jobs of soviet president 
and general secretary of the soviet communist party left moscow on 
tuesday for canada and the united states where he is to meet 
president bush on wednesday 
yeltsins victory stood in contrast to gorbachevs foreign trip 
a showcase of the soviet leaders foreign policy success at a time 
of sagging popularity at home 
his election also coincided with a nationwide wave of panic 
buying triggered by the governments plan to raise prices in a 
transition to a partial market economy 
yeltsin was born feb 1 1931 in the village of butka in the 
sverdlovsk region of the urals he was educated as a construction 
engineer for several years he worked in building organizations in 
sverdlovsk in 19761985 he was head of the sverdlovsk regional 
party committee 
shortly after gorbachev came to power in 1985 he summoned 
yeltsin from sverdlovsk to take over the communist party 
organization in moscow gorbachev also gave yeltsin a nonvoting 
seat on the ruling communist party politburo 
yeltsins populist style soon won him the affection of 
muscovites 
he chopped the capitals party apparatus campaigned in stores 
on trolley buses and on television to improve food supplies and 
public services and spoke out against special privileges for the 
government and party elite 
for many muscovites who watch their leaders rocket by in sleek 
limousines while they stand in line to buy soap and other scarce 
items yeltsins borschtineverypot message has immediate appeal 
yeltsin along with millions of soviets became increasingly 
impatient with gorbachevs perestroika or economic reform 
program he called for faster changes and became an outspoken 
public figure 
then he went too far in a speech to a closed meeting of the 
communist party central committee in 1987 yeltsin criticized the 
slow pace of gorbachevs reforms he also lashed out at 
conservative forces led by politburo member yegor k ligachev 
that speech brought yeltsin a scathing reprimand from gorbachev 
and vitriolic attacks from other party officials who accused him 
of dealing a stab in the back to economic reform 
the criticism of yeltsin was published in the press he was 
stripped of his post as moscow party chief then hospitalized for 
heart trouble 
the word went out that the siberian politician was broken in 
his own biography published this year yeltsin said he felt 
demoralized and beaten but not defeated 
now after two years adversity and the open opposition of the 
communist party apparatus has only swelled yeltsins reputation 
millions of supporters relish his open battles with party leaders 
and cheer his calls to ease the brutal grind of soviet daily life 
he carries a simple message in simple style using his throaty 
bass to boom out accusations and demands in simple phrases his 
square doughy face set in a characteristic snarl his strapping 
erect figure topped by a smooth sweep of silver hair 
people identify with yeltsin the weekly moscow news wrote 
last year in a fullpage story headlined the boris yelsin 
phenomenon 
hes a victim of dislike on the part of higherups who of us 
hasnt been in the same position the weekly said and he is 
being slighted for refusing to seek their approval who hasnt 
dreamed of doing that 
the first big step in his political comeback was a landslide 
victory in march 1989 in direct popular elections to the soviet 
congress of peoples deputies the national parliament yeltsin was 
swept into office with almost 90 percent of the vote obtaining 
approval from more than 5 million muscovites and crushing his 
apparatusbacked opponent 
later that year he carried out a deft procedural maneuver to 
win election to the supreme soviet the national legislature and 
early this year he was elected a deputy of the rssian federation 
congress which tuesday chose him president 
he still is a member of the partys policymaking central 
committee

1947 partition of the subcontinent 
the group is demanding recognition as pakistans fifth 
nationality along with the pathans punjabis baluch and sindhis

retroactive payment of night shifts for the past three years

the election tuesday of populist reformer 
boris yeltsin as president of the russian republic was an 
expression of discontent that could aid reform soviet officials 
said 
it may be a blessing in disguise said foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady gerasimov after hearing of yeltsins victory 
president mikhail s gorbachev has his critics from both the 
left and the right and possibly it is better to have the election 
of a critic from the left he said 
gerasimov and other soviet officials were at the united nations 
to brief reporters before the ussoviet summit on wednesday in 
washington 
igor malashenko foreign policy adviser to the communist party 
told reporters at the same news conference that this victory of 
yeltsin has been misinterpreted as a problem for gorbachev yeltsin 
is also a reformer although he reflects concepts which are 
different from gorbachev 
in this respect i believe it can strengthen the cause of 
reform in the soviet union today many people blame gorbachev for 
problems and now they have another person to blame 
however yuri golik chairman of the supreme soviet committee on 
law said through an interpreter i am not very happy with the 
election of mr yeltsin but it is a fact speaking through an 
interpreter he quoted a russian proverb only when chicks grow 
up to be chickens can we see the results so when the autumn 
comes we will see the results from mr yeltsins election

the worlds newspapers trying to battle 
illiteracy and boost future readership by getting schoolchildren to 
read papers face growing competition from television international 
publishing spokesmen said tuesday 
even among young readers in japan with its low illiteracy 
rates disenchantment with newspapers is proceeding at a 
frightening pace said kazuo ichiriki owner of the newspaper 
kahoku shimpo in sendai 
japanese high school students spend an average of just six 
minutes a day reading newspapers and 20 percent of university 
students dont read newspapers daily ichiriki told participants at 
a international literacy conference sponsored by the american 
newspaper publishers association foundation 
the conference focused on anpas 25yearold newspapers in 
education program aimed at promoting use of newspapers in schools 
worldwide to help youngsters develop lifelong reading habits 
the international gathering which drew 165 participants from 20 
nations was a prelude to a threeday conference in new york 
beginning wednesday 
among the topics to be discussed later in the week classroom 
newscasts by cnn and channel one by whittle communications 
some publishers fear such programming could squeeze newspapers 
out of the curriculum 
we are in a war in fighting for resources and recognitiion in 
schools said uzal h martz jr president and publisher of the 
pottsville pa republican 
japanese publishers began an nie program 4 years ago said 
ichiriki because people from that nation were spending just 30 
minutes a day reading and two hours a day watching tv about 85 
percent of japanese schools now make use of newspapers in classroom 
lessons 
but nie is not just to protect our selfinterest as newspaper 
publishers but because the future of japan could be adversely 
affected he said 
representatives of several other foreign language newspapers 
published in the united states and abroad issued similar warnings 
that newspapers needed to make a more concerted effort to regain 
students attention in the face of growing competition from 
television 
in sweden newspaper readership among 9to14yearolds recently 
has declined after a decade of stability largely because of 
increased television viewing said birgitta pahlen newspapers in 
education manager for the swedish newspaper publishers association 
in stockholm 
in less developed countries poverty or indifference pose the 
larger threat to literacy efforts employing newspapers in india 
for example with 280 million illiterates only one nie effort 
exists according to john ryan coordinator for unescos

more than half the states are responding to 
unexpectedly sharp increases in food prices by cutting back on a 
federally funded program that provides food for women infants and 
children authorities said tuesday 
it means we wont have as many healthy children and mothers as 
we wanted because all of these people are medically at risk for 
malnutrition and anemia rep tony p hall dohio said 
youve got to be in trouble to be in the program in the first 
place 
the changes are being made in the 21 billion special 
supplemental food program for women infants and children known as 
wic which in february provided groceries to an alltime high 455 
million individuals 
hall chairman of the house select hunger committee has been 
calling for a 150 million increase in the program for each of the 
next five years but he said that even with that money in 1991 if 
we stay even well be lucky 
the program provides needy women and children with vouchers 
redeemable at the grocery store for food including milk infant 
formula juice cheese and cereal 
price increases for milk and to a lesser degree orange juice and 
cereal have been named as the prime sources of the budgetary strain 
the department of agricultures food and nutrition service 
which runs the program had figured on inflation in food prices 
this year of a little more than 4 percent 
but the costs of food staples have risen about double that 
straining state programs 
dennis bach head of the iowa program and president of the 
national association of wic directors said 36 of the 44 states 
that responded to a recent survey said they were cutting benefits 
under the program hall said a hunger committee study found similar 
results 
only about half of those eligible are receiving benefits 
according to bach many states are not able to provide food to 
individuals who fall into the lowest priority categories 
there are literally millions of young children who would 
qualify for wic who are not getting served bach said 
weve talked to the states about the first measure being to 
find less expensive ways to provide the same nutrition without 
cutting volume of food or nutritional value of food said f 
philip shanholtzer a spokesman for the food and nutritional 
service 
texas has cut the cereal allowance for 1yearolds and 
2yearolds from 36 ounces a month to 24 ounces a month and will 
drop 27000 program participants those receiving benefits reached 
a peak of 357000 in january 
when prices go up on food items that means our budget wont 
go as far and we have to serve fewer people said ray krzesniak 
chief of staff services for the health departments bureau of 
women infants and children 
texas receives 148 million from usda under the program as well 
as 55 million in state funds plus a hefty rebate on each can of 
infant formula 
iowa which has a much smaller program is nonetheless planning 
to end benefits for postpartum women who are not breast feeding a 
low priority on the usda scale that would drop an estimated 4000 
participants and reduce the total of individuals receiving benefits 
to 45000 for a 400000 savings 
california which currently serves 470000 individuals is 
planning to cut the monthly juice allowance for children three to 
five years old for an expected savings of 12 million it also is 
hoping to save 6 million by eliminating vouchers for cheese

old etonians thronged ye distant spires 
ye antique towers that crown the watry glade and queen 
elizabeth ii came for lunch tuesday to mark the 550th anniversary 
of eton college 
the queen praised the school as second to none though she 
sent her three sons to gordonstoun in scotland she told students 
she had asked the headmaster to give them an extra holiday each 
october 
why october because the actual 550th anniversary of the 
foundation of eton college by king henry vi falls on oct 11 
eton celebrated tuesday a school official explained because it 
was the day before the annual june 4 holiday in honor of king 
george iii which eton chose to celebrate on may 30 
etons calendar like its modes of speech and dress is all its 
own 
the school long ago disposed of top hats flogging and the 
humiliating bum freezer jackets for its shortest boys but it 
remains its own world 
masters are still beaks classes are divs rowers are 
wet bobs cricketers are dry bobs and students are either 
tugs kings scholars or oppidans feepaying students 
students wear longtailed black coats white ties and stiff collars 
in class 
the myth of eton is that the school nestled in the shadow of 
windsor castle inculcates superiority of mind grace and social 
status 
the thing eton majors in is arrogance so deeprooted it is 
totally unselfconscious its ugly and unappealing and ive spent 
the past 30 years trying to unlearn it said mark fisher a labor 
party lawmaker 
lord longford says he once was interrogated by king george vi 
about why he an old etonian became a socialist it came down to 
the conviction that we are all equal in the sight of god 
longford said well i think eton stands for something far 
removed from that 
fisher and longford were among 50 old boys interviewed by 
danny danziger for his recently published book eton voices 
george orwell percy bysshe shelley henry fielding aldous 
huxley the economist john maynard keynes and the poet thomas gray 
who wrote about ye distant spires all attended eton so did a 
score of prime ministers and three members of the current cabinet 
the old etonian association had hoped to lure 8000 old boys for 
the festivities including fireworks and a supper box priced at 
about 105 but sold half that many tickets 
john butterwick chairman of the old etonians blamed an out of 
date mailing list and a computer that couldnt deal with titles or 
the strings of honors behind some former students names 
derek malcolm film critic of the guardian newspaper left eton 
feeling equal to any occasion i mean theres no higher you can 
go socially he told danziger 
pish and tosh says philip howard literary editor of the times 
of london you should see some of the diffident insecure 
boring etonians i meet if i dont see them coming first he 
wrote in the newspaper 
i do get irritated by people who think that because we look 
traditional and oldfashioned the establishment is hidebound and 
backwardlooking the headmaster eric anderson told the daily 
express 
underneath all that its a very modern school 
nine out of 10 etonians go on to universities a quarter to 
oxford or cambridge the school has two dozen science labs a 
beak for every 95 students and even a golf course among the 
famous playing fields where as its said the battle of waterloo 
was won 
the school has at least three applicants for each of its 1260 
places and parents pay 14450 a year for an education plus those 
incomparable intangibles 
being known as an etonian is a handicap because of false 
expectations of snobbery and wealth it arouses wrote howard who 
said one of his old school companions wound up managing a bus 
station

attorney general dick thornburgh asked independent counsel arlin 
m adams to review allegations by one of pierces former top aides 
dubois l gilliam that politics was an important criteria for 
awarding grants through two additional programs operated by the 
department of housing and urban development 
adams who is already investigating whether pierce and top aides 
illegally dispensed political favors in managing the moderate 
rehabilitation program said he would act promptly on thornburghs 
request 
it would appear that in light of gilliams testimony it may 
be appropriate to redefine the mandate of the independent 
counsel adams said in a statement after the justice department 
released a copy of thornburghs letter 
thornburgh based his request on testimony that gilliam who is 
serving an 18month sentence for corruption gave a house 
subcommittee about the operation of the urban development action 
grant program and the secretarys discretionary fund for technical 
assistance and special projects 
mr gilliams allegations concerning how the funding decisions 
in these programs were made are related to the allegations you are 
already investigating concerning huds moderate rehabilitation 
program the attorney general said 
accordingly i consider it proper and appropriate to refer 
those allegations to you for investigation thornburgh wrote 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said thornburghs 
request for a wider investigation was based on a review of 
gilliams sworn testimony by criminal division prosecutors 
paul perito pierces attorney called gilliams testimony 
scurrilous allegations and denounced the congressional 
committee that called him as a witness 
pierce perito said has nothing to fear by an impartial 
review by a group of dedicated and responsible prosecutors as 
opposed to the hysteria and insatiable thirst for publicity of a 
congressional inquiry gone awry 
gilliam testified that during the reagan administration hud was 
the best domestic political machine id ever seen we dealt 
strictly with politics there 
if you were well connected in political circles your 
application got strong strong consideration said gilliam who 
was deputy assistant secretary for policy development and 
evaluation 
gilliams testimony given under a grant of limited immunity 
from prosecution contradicts pierces own sworn assertions to the 
same subcommittee last spring that he never ordered aides to 
approve particular grants 
i know for a fact the secretary made decisions on specific 
projects gilliam said during his congressional testimony earlier 
this month 
in one case gilliam said pierce ordered him to approve a 23 
million grant for an apartment complex and shopping center on land 
owned by hampton university where pierce was a trustee 
gilliam said that pierce ordered the approval of a 56 million 
udag grant to a project in florida because his former executive 
assistance lance h wilson was a private consultant for the 
developer 
gilliam told the subcommittee that pierce ordered him to 
intervene in projects in nashville cleveland and miami that were 
supported by influential local republicans 
adams was appointed by a special court earlier this year to 
investigate allegations that pierce and top aides defrauded the 
government by awarding moderate rehabilitation program grants on 
the basis of political favoritism from 1984 to 1988 
the special prosecutor law allows adams to accept a broader 
jurisdiction at the request of the attorney general 
the original jurisdiction was defined by thornburgh in his 
request to the special court for the appointment of adams 
democrats on capitol hill have repeatedly called for a wider scope 
of the independent counsels inquiry 
gilliam who told lawmakers he took 100000 in bribes and 
gratuities while working at hud from 1984 to 1987 pleaded guilty 
last year to conspiring to manipulate the award of a grant and 
accepting 8000 in illegal gratuities 
rep charles schumer dny one of several house judiciary 
committee members who spearheaded the call for an independent 
counsel last fall welcomed the move but called for even wider 
jurisdiction 
i still do not understand however why perjury is not 
included in the independent counsels jurisdiction it would be 
best if the attorney general issue a broad mandate and let the 
independent counsels investigation go where the evidence 
warrants schumer said in a statement 
thornburgh found there was insufficient basis to investigate 
pierce for allegedly lying to the subcommittee saying the former 
secretary was asked ambiguous questions

a suburban community is toasting the upcoming 
visit of mikhail s gorbachev by slashing the price of soviet vodka 
a libation banned by another municipality when eastwest 
relations werent so merry 
we felt it was an opportunity to extend a greeting to the 
soviet president said bob erickson city administrator of 
lakeville 
erickson said the sale of stolichnaya vodka by the three 
municipal liquor stores at 5 percent above the wholesale price 
discounted from 1499 a liter to 1165 was designed to 
counteract a now defunct advertising campaign for minnesotamade 
karkov vodka 
before the karkov campaign was dropped last week billboards 
featured the soviet president as a pitchman beside the caption 
the partys over a reference to the communist partys problems 
the billboards were up before gorbachevs visit to minnesota was 
announced in their place is a message in russian toasting his 
health 
lakeville has advertised its stolichnaya promotion under the 
slogan the partys just beginning said judy perron lakeville 
liquor manager 
she perron found the karkov billboards somewhat offensive 
erickson said she felt that as a liquor retailer we wanted to 
counteract that 
the vodka promotion at the municipal liquor stores began monday 
and will continue through saturday perron said 
but the drinks havent always flowed this freely 
the small town of hutchinson for example banned the drink from 
its municipal liquor store in 1983 following the downing of a south 
korean jetliner by a soviet fighter pilot the ban was lifted in 
december in recognition of a thaw in the cold war

a judge refused tuesday to overturn john m 
poindexters five irancontra convictions ruling that the former 
national security adviser had presented a weak defense against 
strong evidence 
us district judge harold h greene denied defense motions for 
a judgment of acquittal on the five felony convictions of 
thenpresident reagans national security adviser 
a review of this evidence reveals that proof of defendants 
guilt of the charges is compelling greene said of the 
conspiracy obstruction of congress and false statement convictions 
that were returned april 7 by the jury in the case 
jurors found poindexter guilty of lying to congress and 
destroying documents to conceal covert reagan administration 
assistance of the nicaraguan rebels and the us role in a 1985 
israeli shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
the judge rejecting defense arguments that prosecutors did not 
prove their case against the retired navy rear admiral found that 
poindexters defense was neither broad nor particularly 
convincing 
other than to attempt to weaken the testimony of the 
governments witnesses through crossexamination poindexter simply 
did not have a defense of his own the judge said 
poindexter who did not testify at his trial is scheduled to be 
sentenced 
june 11 when he could be given up to 25 years in prison and 
fined as much as 125 million 
the judge noted that neither reagan who gave a videotaped 
deposition that was played to the jury nor former national 
security council aide oliver l north was willing to relieve 
defendant of culpability in their testimony 
the judge found that reagan may have helped generate an 
atmosphere at the white house which led subordinate officials to 
conclude they were carrying out the presidents wishes by 
repeatedly stressing his commitment to freeing us hostages in 
lebanon and helping the nicaraguan rebels after congress cut off 
aid 
but greene said there is no evidence to contradict the former 
presidents testimony that he warned his subordinates against 
acting outside the law 
the judge also dismissed a defense contention that irancontra 
prosecutor dan webb improperly argued to jurors in his final 
summation that reagan had lied to the american public when he 
denied selling arms to iran for hostages 
poindexters lawyers argued this was an improper expression of 
personal opinion not based on the facts 
while the language regarding a former president of the united 
states should perhaps have been more delicate the prosecutors 
assertion was nevertheless a fair inference from the evidence 
greene said

the world bank approved a 300 million loan 
for china on tuesday the banks largest loan to china since tanks 
suppressed the prodemocracy movement there last june 
approval came despite protests in congress and from chinese 
student groups in this country 
the united states contributes more than any other country to the 
bank which is the biggest source of aid to the third world 
patrick coady the us executive director is one of the 22 
members on the board that met tuesday and approved the loan behind 
closed doors 
until last year china was one of the banks two biggest 
borrowers along with india it borrowed 135 billion in the 12 
months that ended last june 30 since then it has borrowed 140 
million 
the new loan will go largely for planting trees in 15 chinese 
provinces china can take 40 years to repay it at less than 1 
percent interest a year 
within a week after tanks went into tiananmen square bank 
president barber conable delayed loans to china worth 780 million 
though he continued disbursing loans granted previously president 
bush then asked that new loans be withheld but later said they 
should be granted only for basic human needs 
robert levine a spokesman for the treasury said after 
tuesdays board decision that the forestry loan qualified under 
that definition because it provides jobs fuel and housing material 
for lowincome farmers it is part of a 500 million project for 
which china itself will provide the other 200 million 
conable has said repeatedly that the bank makes its loans only 
on economic grounds with no attention to politics 
the bank spokesman peter riddleberger said another loan 150 
million for roads and waterways in china was indefinitely 
postponed at tuesdays meeting he added that the postponement was 
asked by one of the 22 executive directors whom he declined to 
identify except to say he was not the us representative 
the prospect of the two loans brought a sharp protest from 
congressmen including rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of 
the house banking committee in a letter last week to treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady gonzalez said granting the loans would 
endanger the prospect of new money for world bank help to the 
poorest countries and for eastern europe 
we expect that the political atmosphere in the congress will 
be poisoned to the point of making thorough analysis and 
consideration on the merits of these important initiatives 
extremely difficult gonzalez wrote 
he said that under us law coady should vote against the loans 
and try to persuade other governments directors to do the same 
the letter was also signed by rep david r obey dwis who 
chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the appropriations 
committee and delegate walter fauntroy ddc head of gonzalez 
subcommittee on international development bodies

the state department said tuesday it has 
received numerous reports of torture by chinese authorities in 
tibet and it called on china to take effective measures to guard 
against such abuses 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the reports 
received by us officials were similar to those contained in a 
study by asia watch a privatehuman rights group 
the report said the incidence of serious torture in tibet is 
at least as bad as it has been for years and in some cases worse 
some officials have suggested chinas decision to lift martial 
law in tibet a month ago was aimed at encouraging the bush 
administration not to revoke trade privileges for china 
ignoring appeals from some members of congress president bush 
announced last week that chinas mostfavorednation trade status 
would be retained 
about two weeks after martial law was lifted a us consular 
official visited tibet to review the human rights situation there 
it was the first visit of its kind since martial law was imposed 
and ms tutwiler expressed hope that such visits will be permitted 
in the future 
renewed diplomatic access will enable us to monitor the 
situation in tibet more directly and to raise human rights concerns 
with officials there she said 
the administration also hopes the lifting of martial law will 
lead to further easing of tensions and the release of those 
imprisoned for peaceful expression of political views she added 
the asia watch report said there is no indication that the 
lifting of martial law has led to the release of any political 
prisoners 
china regards tibet as an integral part of chinese territory but 
many tibetans favor independence

soviet president mikhail gorbachev may be 
eager to play lets make a deal when he meets with west coast 
executives next week but hes likely to be confronted by plenty of 
skepticism 
gorbachev beleaguered at home by rising prices and bare 
shelves is going west in search of hightech products 
entrepreneurial expertise and longterm business relations after 
his summit talks with president bush 
gorbachevs june 4 luncheon with executives of 150 businesses 
based in california oregon and washington state is more than a 
public relations gesture said bill johnston palo altobased 
hewlettpackard cos director of international planning and 
administration 
he is clearly wooing the west and certainly this area hes 
trying to get his economy squared away and attract us 
manufacturing expertise to the soviet union 
hewlettpackard has had an office in moscow for 18 years and 
last week joined four other us companies in a consortium with 
three soviet health and medical research ministries 
there are a lot of problems johnston said the currency 
is a major issue there is still considerable political and 
economic uncertainty and the two are interlocked they have a mess 
on their hands 
but despite worries about doing business in the soviet union 
gorbachevs visit has charged the bay area with a super bowl 
atmosphere sending corporate executives scrambling for a chance to 
dine with him at a business luncheon some willing to pay 
thousands of dollars for a ticket 
fifteen companies cosponsoring the event are paying 2000 for 
two seats each and up to 500 for additional seats labor leaders 
are complaining they may be left out 
phone lines are jammed at the soviet consulate stanford 
university the san francisco chamber of commerce and city hall 
tshirts with gorbachevs image and tackier souvenirs a 
communist party animal tshirt already are on sale and 
billboards are planned to welcome the soviet leader in the city and 
on the highways 
this may even exceed the super bowl predicted stanford 
spokesman joel shurkin who said the university had been bombarded 
with requests by 5000 reporters to cover gorbachevs speech at the 
1700seat memorial auditorium 
a lottery is planned to determine who gets to go with 
preference to stanford faculty and students 
silicon valley is experiencing a gorbasm said mark muchnik 
president of global development corp who has organized a soviet 
silicon summit to encourage hightech trade between the countries 
raisa gorbachevs planned visit to an oaklandbased program that 
helps soviet children doomed by heart defects and the possibility 
that shell visit some of the areas big tourist attractions has 
sparked more excitement 
lots of people have invited her institutions hospitals 
homes said charlotte mailliard swig san franciscos chief of 
protocol 
armenians latvians estonians and lithuanians are planning 
protests some coming from hundreds of miles away to register 
complaints about soviet policies 
at gorbachevs request the companies at the business luncheon 
will represent a variety of industries telecommunications 
computers agribusiness food processing construction oil 
banking hotels and tourism 
gorbachevs aides chose the companies from a list submitted by 
the chamber of commerce which is cohost of the luncheon with 
mayor art agnos and california gov george deukmejian 
the soviets have an interest in positioning the asian part of 
their country as a pacific rim player said carol piasente 
spokeswoman for the chamber of commerce the purpose of this 
luncheon is to build a relationship between the west coast 
companies and the far eastern part of the soviet union 
in addition to hewlettpackard other companies with 
longstanding ties to the soviet union who will be represented at 
the luncheon are atampt bankamerica and chevron 
rep tom campbell rcalif said the soviets have a desperate 
need for computers fax machines modems and other hightech 
office equipment that are attracting them to silicon valley and 
the interest is mutual 
we are very concerned about losing one of the largest markets 
well ever see said campbell who fears european and asian 
companies will swoop in on the soviets if american firms move too 
slowly 
i dont see any risk to our defense and i do see economic 
benefits one of the great dreams is well be so integrated 
economically that nobody would benefit from an attack he said 
at stanford gorbachev had been expected to visit the hoover 
institution a campus think tank and longtime bastion of 
anticommunism with ties to the reagan and bush administrations 
stanford officials said tuesday that gorbachev would skip hoover 
because he felt his schedule was too tight others speculated 
that the visit was simply too controversial 
the russian ambassador made it very clear that the president 
really wanted to spend time with students and faculty and that 
gorbachev could not do that if he also stopped at hoover said 
robert freelen stanfords vice president for public affairs

the mayor of bucharest announced 
tuesday that authorities would clear the citys main square of 
anticommunist protesters by morning one demonstrator urged 
friends and relatives to come to the square 
about 150 protesters remained in university square on a cold and 
rainy night continuing a 38dayold protest that demands former 
highranking communists be banned from holding public office for 10 
years 
the government led by president ion iliescu a former communist 
official has rejected the demand 
in a statement read on state television mayor dan predescu said 
his office decided to take due measures to open traffic in 
university square because the lengthy blocade has blocked one of 
the citys main thoroughfares and because of the numerous requests 
from local people 
he said the area would be cleared by morning 
one protester urged friends and relatives of those remaining to 
come to square to maintain the blockade 
octavian radulescu a member of the association of former 
political detainees said he would use his car to ram the first 
security vehicle that approaches 
the government earlier said it would do everything possible to 
stop the hunger strike by 11 anticommunist demonstrators living in 
a tent camp on the square some have been fasting for four weeks 
demonstrators have remained split on ending their occupation 
six key groups in the square concerned the hunger strikers 
might die have decided to switch to weekly protests the group for 
social dialogue romanias leading intellectuals backed them 
saying the demonstrators had won a moral victory and they 
didnt want the hunger strikers to suffer any more 
but other groups have vowed to remain in the square because the 
government has rejected their proposed ban on excommunists in 
office 
the demonstrators say the first to be banned should be iliescu 
an excommunist party politburo member who they accuse of rigging 
the general election may 20 in which he won a landslide victory 
since the protest started april 22 several attempts to start a 
dialogue between the protesters and government officials have 
failed the government has called the protest unacceptable 
iliescu announced he wanted to clear the square before the 
election but prime minister petre roman later said the 
demonstrators could remain 
iliescu is leader of the national salvation front a broad group 
that served as an interim government following the ouster of 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in a popular uprising in 
december iliescu fell from favor with ceausescu and became a 
critic of the dictatorship 
ion neamtiu president of an association named for the dec 
1621 uprising pledged to keep his members in the square until 
the final victory 
our democracy is like a frail baby and needs somebody to take 
care of it he said sunday our retreat from the square would 
mean we are renouncing the fight for a real democracy im asking 
all the western governments not to help romanias new neocommunist 
leaders who have stolen our revolution and the elections

angry israeli youths shouting death to the 
arabs stoned palestinians cars tuesday after the funeral of a 
72yearold israeli killed in the bombing of a jerusalem market 
prime minister yitzhak shamir appealed for calm 
two palestinian groups claimed responsibility for mondays bomb 
attack in telephone calls to news agencies 
the stone throwing occurred despite a heavy police presence 
aimed at preventing antiarab violence during the funeral police 
dispersed the protesters after about 90 minutes 
about a dozen arab cars were stoned and some had their windows 
shattered but there were no reports of injuries 
the stonings began about 15 minutes after a procession of 
several hundred israelis went to the cemetery to bury the victim of 
the pipe bomb attack 
six of the nine israelis injured in the bombing remain 
hospitalized israel radio said 
shamir visiting the injured appealed for calm it has to be 
a concern of all the people living in this area to see to it that 
reason prevails he said 
one victim miriam dadya 57 struck in the chest and legs with 
shrapnel told shamir repeatedly i want to see peace let there 
be peace 
shamir replied so do we all 
since the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation began 
29 months ago 712 palestinians have been killed by israelis 
fortyfour israelis also have died 
in one anonymous call to a western news agency in jerusalem a 
man who spoke in arabic claimed responsibility for mondays bombing 
in the name of the islamic jihad fundamentalist group 
the caller said the bombing was in revenge for the may 20 
massacre of seven arab laborers by an israeli gunman who 
authorities said went berserk 
israel still doesnt understand any other language except fire 
and steel the caller said 
islamic jihad also claimed responsibility for the feb 4 attack 
on a tourist bus in egypt in which nine israelis died and 21 were 
wounded 
on monday a syrianbacked palestinian guerrilla group that 
broke with the palestine liberation organization also claimed 
responsibility for the bombing 
plo chairman yasser arafat demanded last week that a un force 
be stationed in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip to 
protect the 17 million palestinians living there 
an israeli foreign ministry official requesting anonymity left 
open the possibility that israel would allow a un delegation to 
visit palestinians in the occupied territories but only if it did 
not deal with security issues 
foreign ministry officials told reporters monday that israel had 
in the past accepted personal envoys of the un secretarygeneral 
if there will be a request for a secretarygeneral envoy who 
will not deal with security then it will be judged on its 
merits said the official we are not saying yes not saying 
no

three companies use their nearly total control 
of the infant formula market to keep prices high and rebates to 
staterun programs for poor children low two federal lawmakers 
said tuesday 
industry officials said their prices were fair 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio accused the companies that 
control the market of participating in a followtheleader 
system of matching a competitors price increases 
american women may have been paying millions of dollars more 
than they should for infant formula because there is no price 
competition he said at a hearing of the antitrust monopolies 
and business rights subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee 
mead johnson ross laboratories and wyeth laboratories make 
about 90 percent of the infant formula sold in the united states 
representatives of stateoperated women infants and children 
programs which provide formula for babies of poor women said most 
additional federal money meant to add participants is being spent 
on expensive formula 
the funds that congress intended for helping more infants are 
contributing to healthy profits for manufacturers said betsy 
clarke director of oregons wic program 
wic mothers receive monthly vouchers to buy a particular brand 
of formula from a grocery store which is reimbursed by wic the 
state contracts to receive a rebate from the manufacturer 
more than 13 million women participate in the 16yearold 
program 
advocates complained that the companies are offering lower and 
lower rebates but rolland eckels of bristol myers in evansville 
ind whose mead johnson subsidiary manufactures enfamil said his 
company paid more than a halfbillion dollars in rebates last year 
he said companies submit rebate offers in sealed bids based on 
the states population and other factors 
john kane president of columbus ohiobased ross laboratories 
said hed like to see additional incentives for breast feeding 
built into the program and development of a number of 
administrative controls to help ensure its effectiveness 
ross markets similac 
sen patrick leahy dvt said in a written statement that 
infant formula price increases over the last 10 years have been 10 
times more than increases for groceries 
eckels whose company was not represented at the hearing said 
its unfair to compare rises in formula and grocery costs 
infant formula is manufactured under conditions that are 
health industry standards he said in a telephone interview 
infant formula is not just something that is thrown together 
both kane and eckels said their companies put much of the profit 
from formula back into research 
he said ross spent more than 500 million last year on research 
and product development with much of the money invested in special 
formulas for extremely premature babies and those born with 
rare metabolism problems 
officials of wyeth laboratories did not return calls seeking 
comment

current safety requirements of both the department of defense and 
the department of energy bob hall told reporters

concerns experts at the three us nuclear weapons laboratories 
only one trident submarine the uss tennessee has been deployed 
with the d5 missiles that carry the w88 warheads 
the report said experts are concerned about a possible missile 
explosion that could result in the release of plutonium the 
experts have been using computer studies to see if their fears have 
foundation the report said but so far their studies have found 
no firm basis for such a possible accident 
the report said the concern lies in the design of the missile 
which has threestages the missile contains its most explosive 
rocket fuel in a cylinder at the center of its uppermost stage and 
the fuel is surrounded by eight thermonuclear warheads 
because of the need for continued study energy secretary james

president fw de klerk said 
tuesday that he has delayed his visit to the united states after 
complaints by black nationalist groups that he would be upstaging 
nelson mandela 
neither the white house nor the south african government had 
announced a date for the meeting with president bush but it had 
reportedly been set for june 18 
the african national congress and others complained a meeting 
with de klerk would be a snub to mandela the anc leader who is 
due to arrive in the united states on june 20 
de klerk in a statement said due to a controversy that has 
arisen in the united states as regards the possible timing of my 
visit in june and also because certain important matters would 
require my personal attention during the next few weeks i have 
decided to postpone my visit to the united states 
in washington presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said de 
klerk notified us officials who are ready to see him whenever 
he wants 
he said the change of schedule will have no impact on 
mandelas visit 
fitzwater said he was aware of the controversy over whether de 
klerk or mandela visits first but said the white house had not 
tried to guide them we are willing to see either gentleman 
at any time he said 
de klerk and mandela have said they dont care which one meets 
with bush first but many anc representatives and some black 
american leaders have said bush should not meet with de klerk at 
all until south africas apartheid system is dismantled it has 
been more than 30 years since a south african head of government 
has visited the united states 
in the province of natal south african police on tuesday 
reported a renewed outbreak of violence 
they said 16 people had died the previous 24 hours including a 
a 14yearold girl reported to have been dragged from her home by a 
mob and raped before being beaten to death 
fighting between black factions in natals townships has killed 
more than 4000 people since 1986 
mandela has criticized de klerks handling of natal saying the 
government has not done enough to stem the violence 
the south african president returned saturday from an 18day 
visit to nine european nations where he met with leaders and

lagging ussoviet talks to cut troops and 
tanks in europe got a presummit boost tuesday but a halfdozen 
tough strategic weapons issues remained unsettled as negotiators 
pressed against a fastapproaching deadline 
the talks held for a third day under tight secrecy at the state 
department focused on the two main arms control areas us and 
soviet conventional forces in europe and the two superpowers 
arsenals of globegirdling nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
two days before opening his summit with mikhail s gorbachev 
president bush met with leaders of the pentagon state department 
and cia for an update on deep economic and political troubles in 
the soviet union 
the only nonsummit appointment on bushs schedule was the 
presentation of diplomatic credentials from new ambassadors 
including aleksandr bessmertnykh of the soviet union 
gorbachev meanwhile arrived in ottawa for a 29hour visit and 
talks with canadian prime minister brian mulroney this is a time 
of dramatic change in the world the soviet president said after 
escorting his wife raisa from their ilyushin 62 aircraft 
the soviet leader appearing tired after a long flight 
expressed hope for a new level of cooperation 
commenting on political developments back home gorbachev told 
reporters he was somewhat concerned by boris n yeltsins 
victory over gorbachevs own candidate in parliamentary elections 
for the presidency of russia but he also said yeltsin had had to 
adjust his position quite seriously over the past few days and 
has adjusted to the better 
on capitol hill in washington senate republican leader bob dole 
said gorbachev was in a much weaker position than when he last 
visited 2 years ago 
bush has 1000 points of light and gorbachev has 1000 
problems dole said alluding to shortages of consumer goods 
ethnic unrest and yeltsins political ascent well be watching 
closely dole quipped if gorbachev brings more than two bags 
he may be staying 
gorbachev will arrive in washington wednesday evening and begin 
three days of talks on thursday 
thousands of demonstrators already are on hand ready to express 
anger over soviet coercion of lithuania and to voice demands for 
causes ranging from a palestinian homeland and democracy in vietnam 
to a unified korea and a cure for aids 
security forces were beefed up to keep control 
no days off and extended shifts said maj carl holmberg of 
the us park police the number of security agents was kept 
secret but soviet spokesman vladimir ustimenko said it will be 
a big bunch of people with big guns 
while there was no announcement from the arms negotiations us 
officials reported progress on one front and continuing 
difficulties on the other 
the good news a us official told the associated press 
was that the two sides had agreed on definitions for such 
conventional weapons as tanks and armored personnel carriers the 
issue is one of several holding up a treaty to cut most weapons by 
at least 50 percent and to set new and lower ceilings on us and 
soviet troops 
the bush administration had accused the soviets of footdragging 
before gorbachev sent deputy prime minister viktor p karpov and 
other experienced negotiators here for presummit talks that began 
on sunday 
the agreement on defining the weapons not only will facilitate 
cutting weapons stockpiles but will make it easier to verify that 
terms of the treaty are carried out the officials said 
on the other hand the two sides remained in disagreement over 
several longrange nuclear weapons the officials said those 
weapons may be excluded from a declaration bush and gorbachev are 
expected to make 
the issues include whether to ban ballistic missiles with 
multiple warheads and the number of flight tests the soviets could 
conduct of their heavy ss18 missiles the arsenal of such missiles 
is to be halved from 308 to 154 but there is no agreement 
restricting improvement in the missiles that remain 
secretary of state james a baker iii in talks two weeks ago in 
moscow proposed two flight tests a year but the soviet 
negotiators led by karpov did not accept the quota in their talks 
with the us group headed by under secretary reginald bartholomew 
the us officials said 
the lack of progress in the current talks will not keep bush and 
gorbachev from a declaration at the summit pledging wholesale 
cutbacks in longrange nuclear arms 
bakers trip to moscow produced a breakthrough on sea and 
airlaunched cruise missiles setting the stage for a summit 
announcement that most major issues had been resolved 
yet a senior administration official played down the importance 
of arms agreements saying the real significance of the meeting 
would be facetoface discussions on disputes over germany unity 
and soviet action against lithuania 
id urge you to put away your scorecard on this one about 
whos winning and whos losing about what agreements are signed 
and trying to enumerate them the official told a 
standingroomonly briefing at the white house he commented only 
on condition of anonymity 
there were conflicting signals about movement toward the signing 
of a ussoviet agreement on trade a condition for moscow 
receiving mostfavorednation trade status 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater refused to rule out 
the possibility of an accord although the senior administration 
official said an agreement was linked to a us demand for a law 
protecting jewish emigration as well as to us unhappiness over 
soviet pressure on lithuania 
details on a new trade agreement were completed last week but 
bush may delay signing the accord 
we would like to go ahead the state department said in a 
brief press notice the situation in lithuania however 
cannot help but influence the final decision on the subject 
the statement referred to the partial economic boycott the 
soviets have imposed on lithuania to try to force a slowdown in a 
drive for independence in the baltic republic 
on another front margaret d tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman said a new commercial air travel agreement was 
initialed on monday and could be ready for signing at the summit 
it will more than triple air service between the two countries 
vastly increasing soviet ticket purchases she said

navy base in yokosuka the justice department said tuesday 
the unprecedented order from the kawasaki district court freezes 
16 million in assets of hosaka engineering co the department

under japanese law the granting of the order indicates that the

leaders of the baltic republics tuesday challenged 
mikhail s gorbachevs authority to negotiate their fate during his 
talks with president bush and said they would not be bound by 
decisions made at the summit 
also tuesday lithuania asked soviet officials to restore fuel 
supplies to a power station connected to a nuclear power plant 
saying the cutoff could lead to an accident at the nuclear plant 
vilnius radio reported 
gorbachev is scheduled to meet with bush on thursday at the 
white house 
we do not want anything signed behind our backs or at our 
expense president edgar savisaar of estonia told a news 
conference in stockholm sweden he said the baltic republics will 
not be bound by the outcome 
the baltic foreign ministers announced the same policy after a 
meeting in the latvian capital of riga they also restated their 
rejection of the 1939 sovietnazi pact that divided central europe 
into spheres of influence 
their declaration appeared in part to be an effort to ensure 
that the baltic issue is not overshadowed at the summit by talks of 
arms control and gorbachevs political and economic problems 
the declaration reported by the lithuanian news service elta 
and by telex from the baltic foreign ministries said that as a 
result of the sovietnazi pact the three baltic states came 
under soviet military occupation during june 1517 1940 and 
subsequently were forcibly incorporated into the ussr 
soviet authorities say latvia lithuania and estonia violated 
the soviet constitution with their steps toward independence and 
gorbachev imposed a partial embargo of oil and natural gas against 
lithuania 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene asked soviet 
authorities to restore fuel supplies to a thermal power station or 
shut down a nuclear power plant to which it is linked vilnius 
radio reported 
she outlined the problem in a letter to gorbachev and premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov vilnius radio said 
as a result of the soviet unions blockade on supplies of 
petroleum products to lithuania reserves of fuel have run out at 
the lithuanian thermal power station which is a component part of 
the ignalina nuclear power station she wrote 
the ignalina plant supplies much of lithuanias electricity and 
is controlled by moscowbased ministries 
the situation at the thermal power station could lead to an 
accident at the atomic power station it will therefore be 
necessary to halt the operation of the atomic power station she 
said 
lithuanian officials did not say how the thermal plant is 
connected with ignalinas safety system 
most nuclear power plants depend on a separate power source to 
run their control rooms and safety systems in the event the nuclear 
reactors have to be shut down without independent power operators 
might not be able to control or monitor the nuclear reactors 
a shutdown of iganlina prunskiene said would cut electricity 
not only to lithuania but to kaliningrad a region of the russian 
republic that can be reached only across lithuanian territory 
electricity is being generated at only two power plants in 
lithuania a nuclear plant at ignalina and the oilburning 
elektrenai station neither is operating at full capacity said 
radio vilnius reporter audrius braukyla he said homes were 
unaffected by the power cutbacks

more than 200 bridge players shuffled 
their cards tuesday at romanias first international bridge 
festival since communist dictator nicolae ceausescu banned the game 
seven years ago 
over the weekend about 800 players from romania bulgaria the 
soviet union poland and france are expected to gather at 
bucharests main exhibition hall scene of the citys annual 
national fair for the may 26june 3 festival 
dragos paun who helped organize the event said he thinks 
ceausescu banned bridge in 1983 because it brought too many smart 
brains together hinting at the former dictators fear of 
opposition of any kind 
but bridge referee victor marculetiu said he thought ceausescu 
banned the game to separate his oldest son valentin from other 
players 
he used to play a lot and was an intelligent guy he was ok i 
think he does not deserve his fate he said valentin his 
brother nicu and sister zoe were arrested and jailed following the 
december revolution in which ceausescu and his wife elena were 
deposed and executed 
bridge fans founded the romanian bridge federation in january 
just weeks after the uprising and began organizing the first 
competitions for its almost 4000 members 
since january romanian players have disputed the european 
championship in bordeaux france placing among the top third they 
also played in a tournament of onetime communist nations in riga 
soviet union and placed second 
marina alart of france said she came to bucharest for the 
festival 
i have found out that the romanians play better than the 
french they like to attack neither the spanish nor the belgians 
are so strong only the germans do better she said 
theodor chimion a former romanian who now lives in france and 
also came to play said i left the country in 1972 then i 
returned to romania to work here for an austrian company until 
ceausescu forced me out in 1982 by that time i had already played 
100000 games 
organizers said the festival was a dress rehearsal for the 
national bridge festival which is to resume this summer at mamaia 
on the black sea 
we actually never stopped playing said marculetiu even 
under the ban we had our championships although we had to meet in 
the players homes illegally we were about 200

yugoslavia soon will form a 
coalition government dominated by noncommunists prime minister 
ante markovic said in an interview published tuesday 
his comment was a significant step in efforts to resolve a 
political crisis that has paralyzed the country and eroded the 
fragile federation that unites its six ethnically and economically 
diverse republics 
the daily borba also quoted markovic as saying he might quit the 
communist party which has ruled yugoslavia since 1945 
markovic was named prime minister in march 1989 by the 
oneparty communist parliament but now hopes to keep his post in a 
free ballot his popularity has grown as his government has moved 
to halt fourdigit annual inflation and make the yugoslav currency 
the dinar convertible 
his suggestions of turning his government team into a separate 
party have drawn fierce criticism from hardline communists in 
serbia yugoslavias largest republic who fear losing their 
authority if markovic forms a new power base 
borba quoted markovic as saying the government will join 
democratic elections and is offering a coalition of all 
parties dozens of noncommunist parties have emerged in 
yugoslavia in the past two years 
the zagreb daily vjesnik commenting tuesday on markovics 
recent maneuvers noted the premier has shrewdly entered the 
empty political space which has been created by the definite 
collapse of the communist party 
the partys authority has deteriorated since the 1980 death of 
communist yugoslavias founder josip broz tito leaving 
yugoslavias diverse ethnic and political groups battling for power 
over the weekend the communist party formally renounced its 
monopoly on power and agreed to multiparty elections 
borisav jovic a hardline serbian communist who recently began 
a oneyear term as president said tuesday he is sure democratic 
parliamentary elections will take place by december 
free elections already have taken place in the northern 
republics of slovenia and croatia and are scheduled in all 
republics except serbia by years end 
slovenia and croatia are now dominated by centerright parties 
which advocate a looser confederal alliance for yugoslavias 
republics they threaten to secede altogether if their demands are 
not met

prime minister eugenia charles the 
caribbeans first female leader expressed disappointment tuesday 
after winning a third consecutive term with a sharply reduced 
parliamentary majority 
i do not call this a victory the 71yearold conservative 
and staunch us ally said in an interview at her home outside the 
capital of roseau there is no joy to it 
final but unofficial returns from mondays parliamentary 
elections gave charles dominica freedom party 11 of the 21 elected 
seats in the house of assembly the minimum required for a 
majority government 
going into the election the party had 17 seats 
during the campaign charles said she hoped to win all 21 
parliamentary seats she said tuesday she did not know why the 
party had done so poorly 
maybe we did not put in enough campaign work thats all 
she said 
despite her nowslim majority charles said she expected to 
carry out the governments development program including the 
planned construction of an international airport to boost tourism 
and trade 
the united workers party formed in 1988 and headed by edison 
james finished a strong second winning six seats in its first 
electoral outing 
james a former manager of the banana marketing corp replaces 
the dominica labor partys michael douglas as parliamentary leader 
labor won four seats unchanged from the previous election 
about 50800 voters of the 82000 residents of this 
289squaremile eastern caribbean island between guadeloupe and 
martinique were eligible to vote 
the election focused on personalities rather than issues ms 
charles opponents accused the prime minister of becoming 
increasingly authoritarian 
the prime minister is a leading proponent of economic and 
political integration of the englishspeaking islands of the 
caribbean 
her tough anticommunist stance and allegiance to former 
president reagan during the 1983 us invasion of grenada earned 
her the nickname iron lady a reference to british prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
she won her first fiveyear term in 1980 and was reelected 
with an increased parliamentary majority in 1985

highway fatalities dropped last year after 
three straight years of increases from 47087 to 45454 and the 
nations top highway safety officer credits tighter laws 
advertising campaigns and greater public awareness 
the death toll represented the lowest ever in terms of miles 
traveled 
most of these regulations went in about two years ago but they 
really didnt take effect until last year jerry ralph curry the 
head of the national highway traffic safety administration said 
tuesday all of these things working together have dumped them 
down 
deaths involving passenger cars dropped from 25808 to 24929 in 
the united states last year as part of the overall decrease in 
highway fatalities the national transportation safety board 
reported highway fatalities account for 95 percent of all 
transportation deaths 
before all the figures were in the safety administration in 
february estimated 1989 fatalities at 45500 and said this figure 
was 22 deaths per 100 million miles traveled the smallest death 
rate on record the 1988 figure was 23 per 100 million miles and 
the 1980 rate was 33 per 100 million miles 
this was not an accident curry said we worked very hard 
along with the rest of the nation to make that happen 
he said seat belt use is up 
the leader of the nation is hawaii 78 percent belt use he 
said puerto rico is second with 70 percent new york state big 
as it is is next with 60 percent the national average seat belt 
use is 46 percent a total of 35 states now have seat belt laws 
he said 
curry also cited three million cars equipped with air bags now 
in use an ad campaign featuring two talking crash dummies and new 
state laws permitting administrative license suspensions for 
driving while drunk or drugged he said vermont connecticut 
maryland florida and california all passed such laws bringing the 
total number of states that have them to 29 
the number of people killed in alcohol and drugrelated 
accidents on the highway is still totally unacceptable said jim 
kolstad chairman of the ntsbalcohol and drug abuse continues to 
be one of the greatest threats to transportation safety facing our 
nation 
aviation deaths were practically unchanged 1160 in 1988 and 
1158 in 1989 general aviation deaths dropped from 796 to 763 and 
fatalities involving airlines from 285 to 277 but those decreases 
were offset by a rise in air taxi deaths from 58 to 86 and commuter 
airline deaths from 21 to 32 
grade crossing accidents invlolving trains and highway vehicles 
accounted for 791 fatalities in 1989 up nearly 15 percent from the 
689 the previous year rail fatalities increased from 563 to 601 
the grand total of all transportation deaths decreased from 
49904 in 1988 to 48243 last year the ntsb said

hydrogen jukebox 21 poems by 
beat poet allen ginsberg set to music by philip glass was 
splendidly sung but difficult to understand in its staged premiere 
at the spoleto festival 
its presented as an acted song cycle with much arm moving 
walking and rolling around the stage by six splendid singers 
few words are understandable far fewer than in most new operas 
in english in an opera when words arent understood the audience 
can get the gist of whats going on from the plot but in 
ginsbergs poems of free association symbolism fanciful 
happenings inside allusions and non sequiturs abound and one line 
of poetry often has no relation to the line before the work 
desperately needs surtitles 
we saw monday nights performance the third in the sottile 
theater we were able to realize there are antiwar poems many 
references to india nature politics and industry with 
appropriate backwall projections 
glass music was usually a melody which the singers james 
butler richard fracker suzan hanson thomas n potter linda 
thompson and darynn zimmer sang over repetitive figures instead 
of chords 
each singer has a fine distinctive voice and they blended 
beautifully 
following the spoleto festival usa hydrogen jukebox will 
be performed at the festival of two worlds in spoleto italy june 
27 through july 15 a year from this fall there are plans to tour 
hydrogen jukebox to 40 or 50 american cities 
in great contrast was mozarts the marriage of figaro from 
1786 in the dock street theater gian carlo menotti artistic 
director of spoleto festival usa staged it it became the hit 
of last years festival and was repeated eight times this year 
quickly selling out 
the production is warm and friendly spiros argiris conducted so 
briskly that some singers especially hilda harris as cherubino 
had difficulty renee fleming from indiana pa is probably the 
best countess weve ever heard also fine were erich parce figaro 
young ok shin susanna and christopher trakas the count 
menottis grandson claudio nearly 3 made his stage debut 
saturday night as the son of the count and countess with notable 
stage presence 
our biggest surprise at the festival was the soldout birth of 
an american avant garde concert at the college of charleston 
host composer john kennedy said that no piece on the program had 
been played more than a handful of times 
the hit was william russells four dance movements three 
written in 1933 and one in 1990 and his 1936 made in america 
first performed in 1990 the concert which included playing a 
suitcase was at its most fun when kennedy donned goggles and one 
glove and hammered a bottle to bits over a metal garbage can 
peter garland was inspired by indians and johanna m beyer by a 
onestring instrument called a lions roar both at too much 
length a 1971 james tenney early minimalist piece completed the 
program 
old festival hands were saying there was the most 
experimentation ever this year a soldout chamber music concert at 
the dock street theater hosted in laidback knowledgeable 
amusing style by charles wadsworth sandwiched the premiere of 
frazelles string trio between bach and vivaldi 
the memorial day weekend streets of charleston were crowded with 
people walking among 11 theaters some going to concerts morning 
afternoon and evening 
menotti said tuesday that his greatest joy is introducing the 
arts to people whove never experienced them before

the government has ordered special 
police protection for an amazonbased rubber tapper who is leading 
the fight against the destruction of the rain forest 
police and farmers said they fear osmarino amancio now in 
hiding faces assassinated by landowners who oppose his 
environmentalist policies 
there have been five attempts on amancios life this year 
the former head of the rubber tappers union chico mendes was 
shot and killed on dec 22 1988 outside his home in the amazon 
town of xapuri near the bolivian border 
in brazil mendes is revered as a man who died protecting the 
rights of peasants against powerful ranchers who often hire gunmen 
to do their bidding in the jungle us producers are planning a 
movie based on mendes life 
landowners have cleared huge tracts of amazon forest to provide 
grazing land for their cattle cleared jungle land is initially 
fertile but quickly loses its nutrients 
poor peasants and rubber tappers who make their living 
collecting rubber from the trees oppose destruction of the forest 
amancio is one of the leading activists of the rubber tappers 
union the union is led by julio barbosa who took over after 
mendes assassination 
mendes was the most prominent of almost 1000 people most of 
them peasant farmers killed at the order of large landowners the 
past decade according to amnesty international only two of the 
gunmen responsible for the crimes have been punished 
osmarino has suffered a number of death threats and police 
will now accompany him and also be posted at his home joao 
martins a federal police spokesman in brasilia said tuesday he 
said police were acting at the request of justice minister bernardo 
cabral 
rosa a director of the national council of rubber tappers in 
rio branco 2600 miles northwest of rio said the protection is 
welcome but it is not enough landowners have gunmen who circulate 
freely in the region and they must be locked up 
rosa who refused to be further identified said amancio may 
still refuse to emerge even with police protection 
the police were guarding chico mendes and that didnt prevent 
his death she said 
amancio 33 was based in the small town of brasilea 93 miles 
southwest of rio branco on bolivias border 
if the government doesnt take serious action there will be a 
bloodbath rosa said 
in a recent interview amancio vowed to continue his fight to 
protect the amazon despite the threats on his life 
i know my life is in danger he said but if we want to 
stay on the land and protect the rain forest all of us must be 
prepared to run that risk

a reputed highranking member of the 
medellin drug cartel convicted in a sevenyear conspiracy to 
import marijuana and cocaine into the united states was sentenced 
tuesday to 30 years in prison 
the term was the maximum allowable under a colombian extradition 
decree 
jose abello silva extradited from bogota in october and 
convicted may 19 on two drug conspiracy counts also was ordered to 
pay 5 million in fines before he can be released 
rod baker head of the us probation office in tulsa said 
abello would be eligible for parole in 10 years 
for 10 years of your life you were a major player in 
trafficking hundreds of thousands of pounds of marijuana and 
thousands of pounds of cocaine us district judge thomas brett 
told abello 
your smuggling network was large and sophisticated the 
quantity of drugs imported into the united states by your 
organization has been responsible for immeasurable human 
suffering 
in a 1989 decree allowing the extradition of accused drug 
smugglers then colombian president virgilio barcos declared that 
no colombian national could be extradited unless the requesting 
state guaranteed it would not impose a prison sentence exceeding 30 
years 
us attorney tony graham sought consecutive life sentences and 
8 million in fines for abello 
but brett ordered a 30year term for each count to run 
concurrently citing the barcos decree 
graham who said he may appeal the sentence said he believed 
brett could have imposed any term he wanted on abello as long as 
he is not incarcerated in excess of 30 years 
defense lawyer richard hayne said he was delighted brett 
followed the decree 
abello stood at bretts bench with his arms crossed during the 
hearing 
asked if he had any comment abello said i am innocent he 
also questioned whether his extradition to the united states was 
legal 
he was convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine and marijuana 
into the united states and conspiracy to possess drugs with the 
intent to distribute 
the conspiracy ran from july 1980 to july 1987 and included a 
transportation network from clandestine airstrips in northern 
colombia through islands in the bahamas 
abello was indicted in tulsa because of a series of phone calls 
and money exchanges between parties in oklahoma and florida about a 
plan to import 500 kilograms of cocaine into the united states 
the plan originated at a february 1987 meeting in aruba at which 
abello agreed to supply the cocaine 
prosecutors called 23 witnesses during the eightweek trial 
many of them convicted drug smugglers who linked abello to 
extensive drug trafficking 
abello testified that he was a legitimate cattle rancher farmer 
and imported car salesman who walked away from the 1987 meeting in 
aruba when cocaine was mentioned

moving slowly under its own power after 
being shoved off a sand bar and minus 885 passengers it had 
brought from jamaica the luxury liner regent star docked in 
philadelphia tuesday evening 
the ship still carrying about 400 crew members arrived at 
penns landing on the delaware river about 7 pm 
the 642foot ship had been heading for philadelphias pier 84 
after a sevenday cruise from jamaica when a fire early sunday 
knocked out its steering and the ship ran aground in the delaware 
bay 
it was stuck in 22 feet of water for nearly two days leaving 
some passengers partying while others were frustrated angry and 
even a bit afraid on monday night the passengers were ferried to 
the delaware shore no one was hurt 
i was scared admitted dorothy klausmeyer of baltimore after 
the liner struck the sandbar couldnt get off and temporarily lost 
lights and power 
the trip was wonderful even running amok it was wonderful 
said marjorie ponder trenton nj another passenger any 
traveler knows you can expect anything at any time 
the crew did the best they could agreed lynn harris of new 
york city but once the coast guard took over everything seemed 
to happen faster 
she said there were some passengers who talking about suing 
but for me the overall experience was interesting i like 
adventure 
some passengers complained about the 15aminute charge to call 
worried relatives from the ship 
the passengers were finally ferried to lewes del where 23 
buses took them to their cars parked at airports and bus stations 
in the philadelphia baltimorewashington and new york city areas 
ferry terminal manager gerald hitchens said the passengers were 
quite understanding 
i didnt see that many people upset they understood the 
situation he said 
ms harris said the end of the adventure was memorable 
as the ferry pulled away from the ship the entire staff and 
crew was on the deck waving goodbye to us and the band playing 
when the saints go marching in it was a beautiful moment she 
said 
mary poniatowsky baltimore said i had a beautiful time 
even though she is a teetotaler and didnt drink any of the free 
booze cruise officials offered 
the regent star got off the sandbar with the help of high tides 
several tugboats and power from the ships own engines 
before the refloating fuel was transferred to upper tanks the 
coast guard had feared the ships anchor could rupture the lower 
fuel tanks 
coast guard petty officer david oney said the liner will undergo 
further inspection by the coast guard and the national 
transportation safety board at philadelphia 
a preliminary inspection tuesday morning at big stone beach in 
lower delaware bay found no serious damage he said 
engineering controls were ok oney said that was when

a surgical tool capable of releasing a spark 
was in use when fire and smoke engulfed a car accident victim on an 
operating table at ucla medical center the fire department said 
tuesday 
an autopsy was scheduled to determine if 26yearold angela 
hernandez of los angeles died of the injuries for which she had 
just undergone surgery or from the fire that started early monday 
in the bedclothes covering her said coroners spokesman scott 
carrier 
among other things doctors planned to check if she had inhaled 
smoke 
the surgical tool a penlike cauterizer used to stop bleeding 
from an incision was present in the operating room along with pure 
oxygen which raises the danger of fire said fire department 
inspector ed reed 
in the presence of oxygen even something like steel wool can 
catch fire pretty easily reed said 
fire chief william burmester of the arson squad said no official 
word on the fires cause was expected until wednesday 
were investigating a cauterizer as well as other tools that 
might have ignited the fabric he said were not quite ready 
to make a final call yet 
the accident grimly recalled an operating room death in october 
1988 at nearby cedarssinai medical center where a 15dayold boy 
was fatally burned when a cauterizer spark ignited a high 
concentration of oxygen in the room 
ucla medical center at the university of california campus 
here is owned by the university regents 
cornelius l hopper a doctor who is vice president of health 
affairs for the state university system noted that ucla 
authorities fire officials and state health regulators were all 
investigating he said the regents would take no action until those 
probes are completed 
no other injuries were reported but the smoke closed down all 
16 operating rooms for the day so they could be sterilized 
the fire broke out about 530 am in an underground level of 
the ucla hospital 
surgeons had finished operating on ms hernandez and were about 
to take her out of the room on a gurney when the sheets and 
blankets ignited said fire department spokesman pat marke 
blinding smoke forced the medical team to leave the operating 
room and kept out university police by the time firefighters 
arrived a few minutes later the blaze had mostly burned itself 
out officials said 
ms hernandez arrived at the medical center in critical 
condition late sunday with heart and liver injuries sustained in 
the automobile accident in santa monica shortly before midnight 
police said

nasa scrubbed columbias launch 
tuesday when an apparent leak in a hydrogen system was detected as 
workers were pumping a halfmillion gallons of propellant into the 
shuttle 
the postponement came about six hours before the scheduled 
launch at 1238 am edt wednesday no new date was set 
immediately and engineers evaluated the problem through the night 
the shuttle holds a 150 million observatory called astro that 
will monitor unseen radiation and provide astronomers with 
unprecedented views of distant stars and galaxies 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said tuesday night that the leak 
appeared to be in the shuttles main propulsion system or in the 
liquid hydrogen systems ground support equipment 
the vehicle was never in an unsafe position at any time she 
said 
none of the seven astronauts were on board at the time 
malone said a new launch date would be set as soon as the 
problem has been identified and corrected 
engineers continued pumping hydrogen late tuesday in an attempt 
to isolate the source of the leaking gas malone said the leak 
could be anywhere in the maze of plumbing that carries the 
supercold propellant into the spacecraft she said 
about 5 percent of the liquid hydrogen or nearly 20000 
gallons had been pumped into the external tank officials said 
less than 25 percent of the liquid oxygen or 35800 gallons had 
been loaded it later was drained 
the cylindrical tank contains two separate vessels one for 
143351 gallons of liquid oxygen and the other for 385265 gallons 
of liquid oxygen the 528616 gallons are pumped separately into 
the engines where the two gases meet and burn to provide thrust 
for columbias three main rockets 
engineers in the launch control center at 515 pm noticed 
indications on their consoles that concentrations of hydrogen were 
building in the rear section of the shuttle 
at that point it didnt look good for launch malone said 
the scrub was announced one hour and five minutes later 
earlier the countdown had proceeded despite a problem with a 
loose connector on one of two communications units in the shuttles 
middeck 
the bad connector was unhooked and nasa planned to use the 
second unit for synchronizing data gathered and transmitted within 
columbia and between the shuttle and ground stations 
the nine to 10day flight is to be the first in five years 
devoted entirely to scientific research astro will probe radiation 
that is invisible from earth and from the hubble space telescope 
deployed last month 
we humans look at the universe in visible light said 
lennard fisk chief scientist for the national aeronautics and 
space administration but the universe is in fact bright in 
many other kinds of radiation and astro will allow us to see the 
universe in ultraviolet light and in xrays 
the crew commanded by vance brand includes four astronomers 
who will operate astros three ultraviolet telescopes an xray 
telescope will be managed from computer commands sent from goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md 
astros four telescopes will make nearly 1000 observations of 
up to 230 sources of ultraviolet and xray radiation while columbia 
orbits 218 miles high the targets will include comet austin 
believed to be making its first trip through the solar system and 
stars and galaxies some as hot as 10 million degrees fahrenheit 
astros observing schedule has changed repeatedly over the years 
due to delays the mission originally was scheduled for march 1986 
and included halleys comet as a target but the challenger 
explosion changed that 
a twoweek delay this month because of repairs to the shuttles 
cooling system resulted in further changes fewer observations are 
planned of comet austin which is receding rapidly from the solar 
system jupiter and some stars are now too close to the sun to be 
seen by the instruments 
but a quasar 10 billion light years from earth is now in a 
better position than a month ago and will be astros faintest 
target said arthur davidsen principal investigator of astros 
hopkins ultraviolet telescope 
nasa expects the first observation to be made 15 hours into the 
mission after the instruments are checked and calibrated 
it is the first time since 1985 a shuttle is taking along 
components of spacelab although the pressurized module normally 
carried in the payload bay is being left behind the astronomers 
will use spacelab computers while working in the rear flight deck 
once the mission gets under way it will mark some other firsts 
too 
it will be the first shuttle flight to offer lessons from 
space tentatively scheduled for the fifth day of the mission 
fortytwo middle school students at two nasa centers will question 
the astronauts through a twoway audio and video link the exchange 
will be taped for distribution to schools nationwide 
it also will be the first time direct radio communication is 
made between a us and soviet spacecraft columbias astronauts 
plan to talk by ham radio to two cosmonauts aboard the soviet space 
station mir 
payload specialist ron parise a licensed ham radio operator 
also will contact amateur radio stations around the world 
the other crew members are pilot guy gardner mission 
specialists mike lounge robert parker and jeffrey hoffman and 
payload specialist samuel durrance

harvard university president derek c 
bok announced his resignation tuesday after presiding over two 
turbulent decades of sweeping changes at the nations oldest and 
richest university 
it is time for me to step down and allow a new president to 
provide fresh energy and continuity of leadership through the next 
decade bok said in a statement 
bok 60 became the universitys 25th president in 1971 he said 
he will step down at the end of the next school year and had no 
immediate longterm plans 
theres no perfect time to leave a job like this which ive 
loved bok said at the end of a hectic day after the 
announcement but ive felt 20 years was the outside limit i 
thought of leaving around the 350th anniversary of harvard but 
the harvard corporation asked me to stay on for a couple of years 
its time for me to look for a new challenge 
his presidency began amid student demonstrations against the 
vietnam war it comes to a close as women and minorities argue for 
greater representation at the school most recently a black law 
professor drew publicity by taking an unpaid leave to pressure the 
law school into giving tenure to a woman from a minority group 
in recent years bok also was the target of protesters seeking 
total divestment of university stock holdings in companies doing 
business in south africa and by clerical staff who formed a union 
after a 13year fight 
through it all the school has expanded in all directions 
a core curriculum of basic studies was instituted women gained 
equal access to the previously allmale college and the school 
became more accessible to parttime students by expanding the 
extension and summer schools 
also under his direction the john f kennedy school of 
government was developed into a major professional school two art 
museums were added and athletic facilities were expanded 
gifts to the university rose from 50 million at the start of 
his presidency to more than 200 million this year a new 
investment organization harvard management co was created to 
manage the universitys endowment and the endowment rose from 1 
billion in 1971 to approximately 5 billion the nations richest 
most of boks efforts at the 17500student school were lowkey 
he worked behind the scenes to maintain traditions at harvard 
which celebrated its 350th anniversary in 1986 
but he was a ready defender of ideals 
when thenus education secretary william bennett blasted 
harvards core curriculum of required courses such as moral 
reasoning as not rigorous enough bok shot back 
instead of pursuing these questions in an informed and sober 
manner bennett has followed his penchant for delivering highly 
publicized polemics against educational practices which he has not 
studied in detail said bok 
bok spoke out in 1982 about professors pursuing commercial 
profit in biogenetic research risking a loss of academic integrity 
bok often ranked among americas most influential educators 
drew wide praise as word of his resignation spread 
hes absolutely one of the leading presidents not simply 
because its harvard but he has provided outstanding leadership 
said robert hochstein of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching 
the university said a committee was being formed to find a 
successor for bok who had been the subject of wide speculation 
that he would step down 
bok a stanford university graduate earned a law degree from 
harvard in 1954 he joined the harvard law school faculty in 1958 
and became dean of that school in 1968 
he is the author of several books including one on labor law 
with watergate prosecutor archibald cox and three on higher 
education 
he has served as chairman of the american council on education 
and the association of american universities and as a member of the 
board of the national association of independent colleges and 
universities

the governing procommonwealth 
party unanimously passed a resolution on tuesday condemning the 
repeated intervention of president bush in favor of statehood 
for puerto rico 
the 100member general council of the popular democratic party 
passed the measure presented by senate leader miguel hernandez 
agosto after an allday meeting 
legislation before the us congress would allow puerto ricans 
to hold a referendum in 1991 on whether to remain a us 
commonwealth with increased autonomy become the 51st state or form 
an independent nation 
the new progressive party has favored statehood for the 
commonwealth 
the resolution said the popular democratic party energetically 
repudiates any attempt by the government of the united states to 
manipulate puerto rican public opinion in the proposed plebiscite 
the repeated intervention by president bush as statehoods 
leading advocate in the plebiscite process represents a misuse of 
presidential power it said 
answering previous charges of outside interference bush 
wrote gov rafael hernandez colon last friday and said as president 
he had certain responsibilities for all the territory under the 
american flag he said he had the right to favor statehood for 
this caribbean island 
hernandez colon leader of the procommonwealth party said bush 
had a right to his personal opinion but that he felt bush was 
abusing his power as president 
earlier he said bush was treating puerto rico like a baltic 
republic by sending two white house officials to the island to 
attend prostatehood rallies and meet with statehood party leaders 
spain ceded puerto rico to the united states in 1890 at the end 
of the spanishamerican war it became a us commonwealth in 1952 
an arrangement under which its 33 million residents are us 
citizens and can be drafted but dont pay federal taxes and are 
ineligible to vote for president

an explosion blasted a natural gas well 
tuesday in southeastern mississippi killing at least one worker 
and critically burning four others authorities said 
a twomile area around the well was evacuated affecting about 
145 people 
authorities initially evacuated only those within a halfmile 
but expanded the plan after the fire went out by itself and then 
reignited for fear that winds would scatter poisonous hydrogen 
sulfide gas 
the gas is naturally associated with some gas fields 
experts at capping gas wells were to fly in tuesday night the 
explosion occurred at about 2 pm authorities said 
the rig collapsed in the initial burst of what sounded like four 
successive explosions said alex thomas who lives within a 
halfmile of the rig others said there was another explosion later 
in the afternoon 
jim maher director of the mississippi emergency management 
agency in jackson said officials intended to keep the gas escaping 
from the well afire to burn off the poison 
what they are going to do is bring a flame throwertype device 
to keep the well burning maher said 
roads were closed leading to the well which is about 75 miles 
southeast of jackson as was a fivemile stretch of us highway 11 
until we get a firm handle on this and somebody that can tell 
us with absolute certainty what is going on there we will continue 
to take extreme precautions said mississippi emergency 
management agency spokesman dusty perkins 
perkins said the rig was known as travis no 3 and was owned by 
ramph oil and gas inc of tickfaw la 
city clerk debbie logan identified the dead man as dwayne 
kennedy of heidelberg his age and exact job were unavailable 
the four burn victims were in critical condition and would be 
moved to burn units in greenville and in mobile ala said lafe 
jones a spokesman for the south central regional medical center in

mikhail s gorbachev expressed confidence tuesday 
on the eve of a superpower summit that he and president bush will 
agree on a formula for permitting german unification without 
upsetting the balance of power in europe 
the soviet presidents comments came tuesday evening in the 
canadian capital where he made a stopover en route to washington 
for his second summit with bush 
asked if he was optimistic about reaching agreement with the 
united states over germany and its membership in nato gorbachev 
replied i am sure of that and tell that to the american 
people 
gorbachevs remark to reporters during a walking tour of a 
downtown ottawa mall marked a sharp turn from the gloomy 
assessments of bush and his senior advisers in recent days and 
gorbachevs own warning that us insistence on a new united 
germany retaining west germanys seat in nato could stall the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern europe 
the soviet union which lost more than 20 million people to nazi 
forces has moved from outright opposition to german unification to 
acceptance of the concept under some formula that would provide 
assurances a new german giant would never again pose a military 
threat to its neighbors 
gorbachev left behind worsening domestic problems including 
panicbuying attempts by the baltic republics to secede from the 
soviet union and clashes between troops and militants in armenia 
as he arrived tuesday in ottawa 
after talks with prime minister brian mulroney gorbachev was 
cheered by thousands as he strolled through a downtown mall 
for gorbachev the 29hour stopover marked his second trip to 
canada which he first visited in 1983 when he was in charge of 
soviet agriculture policy and was gaining notice as a rising star 
in the communist party hierarchy 
on this visit he was not accompanied by alexander yakovlev a 
former ambassador to canada who now advises gorbachev on 
international affairs and has accompanied gorbachev on other trips 
to the west 
yakovlevs absence was seen as an indication gorbachev felt 
compelled to leave at least one member of his inner circle in 
moscow to oversee events in the troubled country during his travels 
during his walk gorbachev shook hands and talked with people 
lining police barriers and chanting gorby gorby gorby 
gorbachev accompanied by his wife raisa and at least 20 
bodyguards spoke with one man who asked him about lithuania one 
of three baltic republics seeking independence from moscow 
gorbachev said he was confident the impasse with the baltic 
republic could be resolved politically and a system of federalism 
could provide a framework for soviet republics pushing for greater 
sovereignty 
look at canada gorbachev said through a translator 
referring to a separatist movement in frenchspeaking quebec 
province you have so many nationalities if we show some good 
will these problems can be solved 
gorbachev told reporters after talks with mulroney that they did 
not discuss lithuania but the subject was mentioned in separate 
talks between joe clark canadas minister for external relations 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze clark said they 
hoped the lithuanian matter would be resolved by negotiation 
clark said he and shevardnadze were in general agreement during 
their talks about the importance of using the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe as a mechanism for building a 
new europe both countries will work toward a conference summit 
later this year clark said 
across the street from the soviet embassy a handful of youths 
appealing for independence for the baltic republics spent the day 
pacing on the sidewalk carrying flags and waving to motorists who 
honked their horns 
leaders of the three republics which were forcibly annexed by 
the soviet union in 1940 and are trying to secede challenged 
gorbachevs authority to negotiate their fate during his talks with 
president bush they also said tuesday they would not be bound by 
decisions made at the washington summit 
addressing another domestic topic gorbachev told reporters he 
was somewhat concerned by the election tuesday of radical 
reformer boris n yeltsin as president of russia the largest of 
the 15 soviet republics 
yeltsin narrowly defeated gorbachevs candidate in the 
parliamentary elections in moscow 
the victory gives one of gorbachevs most vociferous critics a 
new platform to criticize his economic reforms which yeltsin 
contends have not gone far enough to salvage the country from 
severe economic decline 
gorbachev called the protracted voting that yeltsin won a kind 
of confrontation 
gorbachev looking tired with deep creases in his brow arrived 
at the uplands canadian forces base outside ottawa and was greeted 
by governor general ray hnatyshn and mulroney 
snipers were posted on rooftops at the airport and security was 
tight along gorbachevs route to downtown ottawa 
one house along the route proudly displayed a large homemade 
sign in russian hello mr president come and have a beer 
gorbachev heads to washington on wednesday for the summit with 
bush expected to focus on german unification arms reduction and 
trade on sunday he plans to leave washington for minneapolis 
followed by a trip to san francisco

mikhail s gorbachevs motorcade all 70 cars 
slowed down on the way from the airport to the canadian capital on 
tuesday as it passed spike wormingtons handprinted sign 
to wormingtons chagrin however the soviet president did not 
stop apparently gorbachev wasnt thirsty enough 
hello mr gorbachev drop in for a beer the sign said in 
russian 
he always makes an impromptu stop said wormington 25 a 
parttime high school math teacher and land surveyor i thought 
this might be it 
he did stop tuesday but it was hardly impromptu 
a halfdozen limousines flanked by police cars swung into the 
heart of a downtown mall at 715 pm and gorbachev emerged from 
his limousine to the cheers of thousands who gathered after tv news 
programs announced he was about to make one of his trademark 
walkabouts 
with his wife raisa at his side gorbachev shook hands and 
stopped often to talk with people lining police barriers 
one of those he charmed was diane carter 30 a legal secretary 
from ottawa who said he told her she didnt look her age 
that was the most important thing she said he wanted to 
know how old i was he wanted to know what i worked at and how much 
i made 
the crowd burst into cheers when he signed a copy of his book 
perestroika for one man 
there were intermittant chants of gorby gorby gorby 
and people stuck their heads out of windows to catch a glimpse of 
gorbachev as surrounded by at least 20 bodyguards he made his way 
leisurely along the mall spending 45 minutes strolling and 
chatting amiably with spectators 
canadians had reason to expect a stop by gorbachev on almost 
every trip gorbachev takes into the soviet countryside or abroad 
he finds time for at least one more or less spontaneous encounter 
with the public 
he caused a paralyzing traffic jam and a media sensation in 
decmber 1987 when he ordered his limousine to a sudden halt on 
connecticut avenue in downtown washington and plunged into a crowd 
shaking hands and engaging in goodnatured banter the move was so 
unexpected that part of his motorcade cruised on ahead and got 
separated from him 
when gorbachev takes a stroll however the crowds and confusion 
can ruin even the bestlaid plans in belgrade the capital of 
yugoslavia security men got nervous about the crush of people and 
hustled gorbachevs entourage back into limousines for a quick 
departure it all happened so fast they left the local mayors 
wife behind 
camera crews are always particularly eager to know where to set 
up in time to capture gorbachevs smile and friendly gestures as he 
and his wife raisa charm a crowd 
at about 5 pm as gorbachev neared the end of his first day of 
meetings with prime minister brian mulroney and other officials 
mulroneys office said gorbachev might appear at the downtown 
sparks street mall two hours later 
thousands of residents flocked to the pedestrian shopping area 
i want to see his aura said dan creed 23 as he jogged 
from ottawa university to the mall hes gone to great lengths to 
craft his image so we might as well see it in person 
not everyone had a pleasant message for gorbachev 
free the baltic states its their right said richard 
calendra 23 of toronto who was waving a yellow green and red 
lithuanian flag to signal his support for the breakaway baltic 
republic 
calendra and about a dozen other protesters waving estonian and 
latvian flags as well as the lithuanian banner lined the mall 
a larger demonstration was scheduled at parliament hill on 
wednesday before gorbachev leaves canada for washington for his 
second summit with president bush

crews scrambled tuesday to contain 
120000 gallons of fuel that spilled after an alaska railroad train 
derailed and scattered cars on both sides of the track 
seven of the 19 cars that derailed were leaking fuel railroad 
spokeswoman vivian hamilton said at the scene each of the tanker 
cars held 20000 gallons and two of them were totally drained 
a spokesman for the state department of environmental 
conservation earlier had erroneously said in juneau that all 19 
derailed cars were leaking 
the southbound train with 68 cars derailed at about 130 pm 
monday said arnold polanchek vice president of operations for the 
stateowned alaska railroad corp 
the fuel was en route to anchorage from the mapco alaska 
petroleum inc refinery in the town of north pole near fairbanks 
by early tuesday pumps and hoses had begun siphoning the fuel 
from the ground said paul bateman fairbanks program manager for 
the state environmental department 
weve got cars upside down sideways holed on both ends 
theyre in all shapes and condition its a mess said bateman 
who spent monday night at the scene 
railroad crews were also on the scene about 40 miles south of 
fairbanks near dunbar station polanchek said the crews worked to 
rebuild nearly 300 feet of track and remove the tanker cars they 
also laid absorbent boom and began trying to skim oil off the 
surface of a nearby creek 
no one was injured in the derailment and the company was trying 
to determine its cause polanchek said 
hundreds of tourists scheduled to visit denali national park and 
preserve and the mount mckinley area by train tuesday were to be 
bused around the wreck tour officials said 
the fuel had drained into two beaver ponds and into goldstream 
creek which flows into a wildlife refuge about 40 miles south of 
fairbanks it appeared to be at least several inches thick on a 
small stream that fed the creek 
more of the fuel probably would have run into the creek had it 
not been for some beaver dams that contained it a state 
environmental official said 
workers used a bulldozer to shore up one of the dams and used 
plywood and absorbent pads to strengthen the other said chuck 
kleeschulte of the state department of environmental conservation 
the beavers are very helpful he said 
railroad officials initially estimated the spills size at 
60000 to 80000 gallons but dale nelson an environmental 
engineer for the railroad later revised the estimate upward to 
120000 gallons of jet and diesel fuel 
this is a major spill one of the most major ive seen at the 
railroad nelson said 
the alaska railroad was purchased by the state from the federal 
government in 1985 it runs one freight train northbound and one 
train southbound daily

the louisiana house tuesday passed a 
bill banning affirmative action programs that was sponsored by 
state rep david duke a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan 
the 6628 vote crossed party lines 13 people abstained the 
bill was sent to the senate 
some are going to call this bill racist said duke a 
republican this bill simply prohibits racial discrimination in 
hiring promotion scholarships 
it prohibits affirmative action programs that discriminate on 
the basis of race there is no justification to discriminate 
against someone who works hard who is qualified for a job 
duke said his bill would outlaw the use of racial quotas in 
promotions or hiring 
id love to see the day that everybody is treated fairly 
thats not what is going on said democratic rep diana bajoie 
many of you see me as a black woman before you see me as a member 
of this house 
she went on you would think we never had discrimination we 
have tried to right some wrongs perpetrated on our people for 100 
200 years since they entered this country its too early to stop 
that its only been 25 years since we passed the civil rights 
act 
duke countered you dont eradicate discrimination by putting 
in a policy of discrimination young people coming up were not part 
of past discriminatory policies 
democratic rep cd jones warned such a law would be 
unconstitutional 
you can camouflage things but racism is racism said jones 
who is black what we just passed is an attempt to try to set 
black people in this state back onethird of the population in 
this state you still must understand that we live in the united 
states and federal law takes precedence over the louisiana 
legislature and thank god for that 
duke left the kkk in 1980 accused of trying to sell a 
membership list to a rival faction and formed the national 
association for the advancement of white people 
elected to the louisiana house from a nearly allwhite district 
in 1989 he says his racism and nazi sympathy were youthful errors 
now duke 39 is running for us senate although the state gop 
has endorsed another candidate

rights plan designed to discourage unsolicited takeover attempts 
john j curley chairman president and chief executive of 
gannett said may 21 the rights were not being distributed in

percent of gannetts stock up for sale 
douglas mccorkindale vice chairman and chief financial officer 
of gannett said in a telephone interview the share rights plan had 
nothing to do with the foundations plans to sell its stock 
we have been considering it for a couple of years he said 
adding that the board felt it would an appropriate time to put it 
into effect because acquisition activity had fallen off in recent 
months 
gannett based in arlington va said its board declared a 
dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding 
share of gannetts common stock the right entitles stockholders to 
buy a fraction of a share of a new series of junior preferred stock

common stock each right would entitle holders to buy a number of 
gannett common shares having a market value of twice the exercise 
price the gannett board also could convert each right into one 
share of common stock 
the company said the rights would not prevent a takeover but 
should encourage anyone seeking to acquire the company to 
negotiate with the board prior to attempting a takeover

jay harris a vice president of 
knightridder inc sees a bright future for newspapers that can 
adapt to change while maintaining traditional journalistic values 
delivering the university of oregon school of journalisms 
annual ruhl lecture on may 22 harris said four great changes have 
swept over the newspaper business increased competition from other 
news media a drop in readership major societal changes and the 
rise of a business imperative 
to succeed newspapers will have to continue their role as the 
publics watchdog with hardhitting investigative reporting and 
aggressive coverage of government at all levels he said 
but we need to do more harris said we will need to 
publish newspapers that are a pleasure to read and far better 
organized we will need to make our papers helpful to readers as 
well as informative a complement to the full range of activities 
and situations they encounter in their daily lives 
newspapers also must reach out to blacks hispanics asians and 
indians he said 
but the trend that poses the greatest threat to the industry is 
the tendency by some newspaper owners to allow concerns about 
business matters to overwhelm all other considerations harris said 
he said the rise of publicly held newspaper groups has more 
often than not brought higher quality news staffs and newspapers 
but he added there have been instances where the ascendancy of 
the business imperative has not been positive instances in which 
papers have been stripped down too far instances in which the 
interests of local communities have been subordinated almost 
entirely to the interest of owners instances in which the high 
standards of modern newspaper journalism have been cast aside all 
with the sole purpose of squeezing out evergreater profits

a former editor for the wall street journal sued 
the newspaper for 1264 million may 22 claiming he was fired and 
his reputation smeared by a false charge of plagiarism 
jonathan kandell the journals assistant foreign editor prior 
to his dismissal may 2 also demanded the return of notes and other 
documents that he contended the papers editors had kept knowing 
they would support his position 
the journal fired kandell after accusing him of lifting 
uncredited material from another writers book for a page 1 article 
about three private entrepreneurs in eastern europe 
roger may a spokesman for dow jones amp co inc owners of the 
journal said dow jones believes the suit is utterly without 
merit and the company intends to defend itself vigorously 
kandell quoted paul steiger deputy managing editor of the 
journal as having said his alleged offense was the most serious 
transgression to take place at the journal since the foster winans 
case 
r foster winans was convicted in 1985 of using his position as 
a wall street journal columnist to profit from insider stock 
trading information he was sentenced to 18 months in prison a 
5000 fine and five years probation 
in his federal court lawsuit kandell contends he was libeled 
and his professional reputation destroyed by the journal he 
demanded 10 million in punitive damages and 264 million in 
compensation for willful wanton and reckless disregard of the 
truth and actual malice on the papers part 
he said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that the 
newspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the same 
subject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper village 
voice about kandells case the voice was not named as a defendant 
in the suit 
kandells article in the march 30 edition of the journal 
profiled a soviet machine tool maker a czechoslovak inventor and a 
hungarian banker as examples of individuals succeeding in the 
private sector 
kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three 
individuals in their countries after hearing them speak at a 
meeting in new york sponsored last november by the council on 
foreign relations 
he said that at the same meeting he also learned of a book 
communist entrepreneurs and met the author john w kiser iii 
he said he later read the book once and put it aside

station ketv for 15 million may 21 alleging one of its reporters 
slandered him in comments to police officers and reporters in 
illinois 
ketvs general manager david summers said the suit filed by 
robert wadman had no merit 
in a lawsuit filed in state court here wadman alleged reporter 
frank brown told members of a crowd at the kane county ill 
courthouse on may 18 that wadman is the subject of an 
investigation by a grand jury in omaha 
some of the information provided by brown was broadcast later 
that day on chicago television station wls the lawsuit said 
it said browns statements along with discussion of them by 
rankandfile police officers and the wls broadcast damaged 
wadmans reputation and his ability to act as police chief in the 
chicago suburb of aurora ill 
summers said i dont see anything untruthful that he said 
the lawsuit names ketv as the sole defendant saying brown was 
acting as an agent and employee of the station 
brown traveled to aurora to report on a controversy involving 
wadmans disciplining of a police officer there who had been 
indicted on felony charges for allegedly using excessive force 
against a person being held in a jail booking area 
as omahas police chief in 1986 wadman was fired by the 
administration of thenmayor mike boyle for refusing to sign 
disciplinary orders against three police officials a court ruling 
gave wadman his job back but he lost it again last year in an 
appeal to the nebraska supreme court

cincinnatis police chief must pay 4365 
in lawyers fees resulting from a television stations legal battle 
to obtain records in a police shooting the ohio supreme court 
ruled may 23 
the court ruled 61 that the fees should be awarded because 
there was a public benefit in the disclosure of police records in 
the shooting of a suspect by a police officer during a scuffle last 
oct 9 
chief lawrence whalen had cited executive privilege in 
withholding the records but the states highest court ordered 
whalen on jan 10 to turn over the records to wlwttv 
the station had sought a tape recording of radio transmissions 
from an open microphone in officer george millers patrol car while 
he struggled with donnie roberts miller said he shot roberts after 
roberts tried to strangle him 
in its latest ruling the supreme court said whalen should pay 
the fees to wlwt and its parent company multimedia inc because 
his decision to withhold the records was unreasonable it also said 
whalens argument that the station could have sought the records 
from his superiors was baseless because whalen had admitted he had 
responsibility for keeping the records 
the court called whalens decision not to release the documents 
an unreasonable attempt to avoid the clear mandate of the state 
open records law

the willingness of the press to accept 
unskeptically the word of businesses critics has turned 
reporters into patsies time and again a philip morris 
executive says 
reporters and editors treat the president the senator the 
congressman the mayor and companies with great skepticism which 
is as it should be guy l smith iv said may 23 but let a 
critic of business come along and the media turn over their 
typewriters to him 
smith vice president for corporate affairs of philip morris 
companies inc said the news media often become loyal to one side 
in a dispute and lazy and uncritical of the side they support 
to make his point smith attacked news accounts about a 
forthcoming environmental protection agency study which sources 
have said will report that secondhand smoke inhaled by 
nonsmokers causes more than 3000 cases of lung cancer annually 
he said the epa assessment was based on 23 studies 18 of which 
found no link the other five he said were conducted in greece 
japan and china and may be invalid because they did not consider 
lifestyle questions such as the effect of oils or charcoal used in 
cooking 
the problem here is what always happens when editors and 
reporters take sides smith said they start running not news 
reports but morality plays and any fact that does not fit is 
transformed to fit or slides down the memory hole 
this doublestandard journalism is a particularly strong 
temptation in reporting on science where the usual tentativeness 
complexity and ambiguity of scientific discussion simply does not 
make a good story 
reporter lewis cope of the star tribune of minneapolis 
presidentelect of the national association of science writers 
said smith has a right to his opinion but there is a need to 
report contrary views from reputable scientists particularly on 
matters that are so important to peoples health 
offering another example smith said the press often cites a 
figure first published by the american automobile associations 
foundation for traffic study saying the average child sees 100000 
beer commercials between age 2 and 18 he said a youngster would 
have to watch 14 hours of television a day or five or six hours of 
sports television to see that many 
but the press keeps using the figure as established truth 
never bothering even to devote the two minutes of critical 
thought it would take to realize its preposterous nature he 
said

while sales of a newspaper sold by the homeless 
continue to rise turmoil on the papers staff has begun to attract 
as much attention as the unique publication itself 
as many as eight salaried staff members at street news left 
their jobs in midmay accusing the papers editor and publisher 
hutchinson persons of erratic and irresponsible behavior 
for the paper where some staff members have worked 16hour days 
and viewed their work more as a mission than a job it is the 
latest in a series of blows 
street news began publishing in november with a tiny sales force 
of homeless people who gave up begging in the citys subway system 
to sell papers that give them 45 cents of the 75centpercopy 
price 
as word spread of the creative way of turning those who were 
down on their luck into working people again the number of sellers 
and buyers expanded dramatically persons estimates distribution at 
300000 monthly 
it was great it was happy said wendy koltun who helped 
found the paper we were helping so many people 
but in january koltun quit 
things started to happen that made me realize that i could not 
trust his decisionmaking or his behavior she said of persons 
and i could no longer represent street news operational 
integrity as something that reflected my views 
at one point an anonymous complaint was made to the state 
attorney generals office and an inquiry was begun into its 
management and allegations that it had misrepresented itself the 
irs began reviewing the designation of street aid the newspapers 
parent organization as a taxexempt charity 
other more established organizations to benefit the homeless 
began complaining that street news and persons were only providing 
the homeless with money not widerranging help 
amy connors who joined the staff in february and quit several 
weeks ago said persons frequently fired people abruptly changed 
plans and mistreated the homeless 
three months at street news is like three years anywhere else 
i had a job for 12 years and it seems like i worked at street news 
as long she said 
as soon as anyone asked him any questions he would at first 
be extremely evasive and very condescending they would press him 
further and hed become enraged and very abusive 
persons dismisses the complaints saying that in any company 
employees are going to be disgruntled and think they can do a 
better job 
weve lost a lot of employees some couldnt keep up he 
said im pretty demanding to work for everybody comes in 
saying wow this is really great after a few months they say

with the demise of communism in eastern 
europe the white house is wondering why the united states should 
continue broadcasting radio programs to those countries 
a review by the national security council recommends that the 
broadcasts by radio free europe be reduced accordin to a source 
familiar with the preliminary report scheduled for completion may 
30 
radio free europe based in munich west germany broadcast to 
eastern europe throughout the cold war and was much reviled and 
jammed by the communist governments in those countries 
although the changes in eastern europe have given radio free 
europe unprecedented reporting and broadcasting opportunities they 
also have called into question the need for its existence 
the network announced may 24 that it was opening offices in 
prague and warsaw at the invitation of the leaders of 
czechoslovakia and poland czech president vaclav havel attended 
the bureau opening in prague and praised radio free europe for its 
programs that contributed to the fall of communism 
but the nsc review is expected to call for radio free europe to 
eventually cut its programs to czechoslovakia hungary and poland 
the source said the money saved would be channeled into other 
foreign broadcasting services possibly the voice of america or the 
us information agencys television network said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the board for international broadcasting which controls radio 
free europe argues that eastern europe needs radio free europe 
during its transition to democracy that its audiences are far 
greater than those of voa and that its functions are completely 
different

the general manager of radio station wow 
denied allegations by the naacp that the station discriminated 
against minorities in its hiring practices 
ken fearnow said may 21 that the allegations in a petition filed 
recently with the federal communications commission were 
absolutely ridiculous 
the petition calls for the fcc to refuse renewal of operating 
licenses for five midwest radio stations including wow because of 
allegedly poor minority hiring records it was filed by the naacps 
nebraska kansas and oklahoma state conferences 
weve been completely in compliance with the fcc 
requirements on hiring fearnow said 
the station has gone beyond fcc regulations on equal employment 
practices by specifically contacting minority employment programs 
in search of employees fearnow said 
were looking for a qualified person to do the job that needs 
to be done and it doesnt matter what color that person is 
fearnow said 
weve had a hard time hiring minorities he said we 
havent had the applications 
the naacp petition alleges the stations have employed only token 
minorities and do not appear to operate meaningful equal employment 
opportunity programs

the chairman of the federal communications 
commission says an era of increased competition is imminent in the 
cable television business 
alfred sikes said may 22 at a meeting of the national cable 
television association that it should accept government action to 
open the marketplace the cable industry has been deregulated since 
1984 though both congress and the fcc currently are considering 
steps to reimpose some regulation 
you cannot expect government to continue sanctioning indeed 
protecting and promoting cable as a solesource provider of video 
services while at the same time forgoing the regulation that 
historically has been placed on monopoly operations sikes said 
the american people in short will not tolerate an unregulated 
monopoly indefinitely 
though cable tv has soared in popularity over the last decade 
it is now received in 571 percent of all us homes with 
television the industry has been beset recently by complaints 
from consumers about poor service and rising rates 
the fcc is scheduled to take up cable issues at its july 26

a halfdozen accordions stand on lawrence 
shine moutons kitchen table the result of hundreds of hours 
of work and decades of experience 
my daddy was a musician amadia breaux he composed jolie 
blonde i tried to learn to play but didnt learn to play as 
well as he did said mouton 63 i said if i couldnt play id 
learn to make em 
moutons name is now as well known among cajun musicians as his 
stepfathers his accordions are played by such performers as the 
popular zydecajun musician wayne toups and jimmy basile of 
cajun tradition the mamou group nominated for a grammy award this 
year 
as cajun music and its spinoffs have become more popular so has 
moutons craft about 45 people now make the little germanstyle 
squeeze boxes most of them in little backyard sheds 
i figured i wasnt any dumber than the next fellow i figured 
if he could make it i could make it too said john elton doucet 
whose workshop is in his grocery store the first one wasnt too 
too good but then the second one was good 
doucet makes six to 10 accordions a year its painstaking work 
the flat metal reeds and the bellows are imported from italy but 
everything else is made by hand 
or at least adapted for instance many people make the big 
silver buttons on the left end of the accordion from chromeplated 
chair glides they snip off the little prongs solder a wood screw 
onto the back and fill in the curve with lead 
you drill a hole and its all threaded and ready to go 
said larry miller who makes accordions only for his family but 
makes and sells cajun triangles spoons set in wooden blocks so 
theyre easy to use as a rhythm instrument and the 
overtheshoulder style metal washboards used by zydeco bands 
the four wooden stops used to close off the four sets of 
accordion reeds are made from cabinetwork spindles and tiny coiled 
screws inside the accordion were made to put tension on stereo 
tuning knobs 
some people paint their accordions others varnish them to show 
off finegrained woods the long curved halfdowels which open or 
close the reeds often are covered with gold mylar tape which gives 
even more glitter than the once traditional gold paint and is a lot 
easier to apply 
miller said he began learning to play the accordion because of a 
lecture from cajun music great dewey balfa after an assembly at 
the school where miller was principal miller told balfa that his 
father had made triangles and played accordion but none of his 
brothers or he had kept it up 
he said if youre concerned about it dying in your family 
itll probably be your fault you were the one that broke the 
chain recounted miller it hit me like a ton of bricks three 
days later i went and bought an accordion and commenced to 
learning 
about seven years later he started thinking about making the 
instruments he was influenced by stories he had heard about mouton 
and a few other men who had loved the instrument so much that 
after repairing and rerepairing german instruments made before 
world war ii they started making their own 
strictly speaking the cajun accordion is a melodeon or diatonic 
accordion a very different instrument from the big piano 
accordion popular shortly after the turn of the century 
for one thing the cajun accordion is much smaller its about 
11 inches high and six inches deep and will squeeze down to 14 
inches across it weighs about eight pounds less than a third the 
weight of its big cousin 
its held on with a strap around the back of the left hand and a 
smaller strap for the righthand thumb and played like a 
handdriven harmonica each of the 10 righthand buttons gives two 
notes one when the accordion is squeezed the other when its 
pulled out 
the 28pound piano accordion cant be held up without heavy 
padded shoulder straps its twooctave keyboard is twice as long as 
the cajun accordions little row of buttons each key always plays 
the same note 
since it does have all 12 notes of the chromatic scale it can 
play in any while the cajun accordion is limited to four if a 
player is particularly adept and plays every note of the scale 
only in one 
however cajun accordion makers say that their instrument can 
overpower the bigger one because it has four sets of melody reeds 
german accordions began showing up in cajun country around the 
1890s and quickly upstaged the quieter fiddle as lead instrument 
world war ii stopped imports and the factories were destroyed or 
converted to other uses 
factories resumed making accordions later but the style popular 
in louisiana four sets of reeds controlled by one set of buttons 
wasnt used much elsehwere 
mouton charlie ortego and sidney brown and marc savoy are 
generally considered the pioneers of modernday accordion building 
mouton began making accordions in 1961 opening up his fathers 
old germanmade sterling accordion and using it as a reference 
in 1970 heart trouble forced him to choose between a transfer 
and retirement from work as a civil engineer for conoco his hobby 
became his fulltime job 
not to say a living i dont make that much money making 
accordions because the cost of reeds and bellows is so high he 
said 
those two parts are ordered from italy and cost hundreds of 
dollars reed makers dont give any discounts miller said but he 
and about 25 other accordion makers recently began ordering bellows 
together 
i remember when you could buy reeds for 5 a set said 
mouton now the cheapest reeds are 90 and bellows start at 150 
and those are for a brand scorned as vastly inferior to those 
made in italy 
importing presents other problems i ordered some reeds oct 
19 1989 they have my money i still dont have the reeds said 
mouton 
mouton still works in a little backyard shed though his heart 
problems have cut back to six or seven hours a day and about 20 
accordions a year a friend has begun cutting out the wooden parts 
for him to put together 
photographs of his father and his wife betty stand on a shelf 
over his workbench on the walls are a plaque naming breaux to the 
cajun musicians hall of fame in 1984 musicians signed promotion 
photographs and several wayne toups posters one of them 
inscribed to mr shine thanks for being a special friend 
mouton opens a corner cabinet 
this is my daddys old accordion he bought it in 1918 for 
750 i dont know what it would cost today but i turned down 
2500 for it

pia zadora tired of fighting her image as a 
cinema sex tart was ready to call it quits five years ago 
finally she returned to her musical roots 
the result was pia and phil an album of nightclub standards 
backed by the london philharmonic orchestra 
critics who had berated zadora for everything from her movies 
to her marriage to multimillionaire meshulam riklis suddenly 
remembered her musical background 
it was really a big victory for me emotionally and otherwise 
that was my lastditch effort my last bag of tricks thank god it 
singing was something i had done all my life zadora said in a 
telephone interview from her los angeles home 
in the background her children kady 5 and kristofer 3 
could be heard playing in the bathtub zadora 34 said she took an 
18month break from touring so she could be with them 
during that time she recorded her new album pia z 
however she wont perform any of the songs from that lp at her 
concerts with the phoenix symphony orchestra on june 12 because 
the orchestra did not have enough time to learn the new music she 
goes to atlantic city nj for a short stint following her 
phoenix appearances 
zadora a child of a violinist was 6 when she appeared in the 
broadway production of midgie purvis after several other 
musicals she attended the juilliard school of music in new york 
zadora jumped into films with butterfly in 1981 earning a 
golden globe for best new actress but in 1982 her career took a 
turn for the worse with the release of lonely lady a critical 
and boxoffice flop 
i must have been stupid zadora said it was something 
that was offered to me it was a universal picture and there were 
a couple of reasons i liked it it was a serious role about a 
writer but i had to live with it i had to live with it when it 
was a movie of the week on television the week it was on i went 
out of the country and wouldnt return my phone calls 
zadora also released a few danceoriented poprock albums that 
flopped in the united states in the early 80s she scored a 
european hit with jermaine jackson on when the rain begins to 
fall but she refers to her early musical releases as novelty 
records 
i really was in a tough position she said i got caught 
in one mousy project after another from lonely lady to all 
those silly records 
but zadora rebounded with pia and phil and then i am what 
i am the albums followed the path paved by linda ronstadt in 
1983 with her classicsfilled whats new album 
zadoras orchestrally backed works included such tested songs as 
it had to be you and smile 
pia z released in february is more poporiented it was 
produced by grammy winner narada michael walden who has worked 
with whitney houston and barbra streisand 
zadora said she is apprehensive about returning to the screen or 
stage and feels her golden globe in butterfly has been 
tarnished by critics who said her husband bought the trophy by 
wining and dining voters 
being married to a millionaire sometimes makes it hard for 
people to believe she is a legitimate artist zadora said 
certain people dont think im serious she said they say 
why should she bother to do it with all that wealth those people 
dont understand that it doesnt matter how much luxury or wealth 
you have you still have to be productive

the heroin business has rarely been 
better for chang chifu alias khun sa who seems more concerned 
about the rival wa tribe than a us government indictment 
the united states has branded chang the prince of death and 
the billiondollar drug kingpin of the golden triangle 
it has charged him with importing or trying to import more than 
3500 pounds of heroin into new york between september 1986 and 
february 1988 and has threatened to go after him if he can be 
located 
sources who were with khun sa when he learned of the indictment 
announced march 15 in washington described the chainsmoking 
warlord as angry but not particularly worried 
he has not for example made noticeable changes in his 
operations and there is no indication the flow of heroin from his 
area of control in burma has decreased 
the united states did manage to arrest four members of his drug 
ring in hong kong on may 20 they are to be tried in new york on 
charges of smuggling 46 pounds of heroin into the united states on 
may 9 
one of them sai yeung ng was described as a brotherinlaw of 
khun sa a federal complaint filed in us district court in 
brooklyn identified the others as dunshun yeung wirote tankirdkit 
and yushing lam 
a warrant is out in thailand for the arrest of szewah yeung 
another defendant in the case 
the united states has been vague about its plans to seize khun 
sa but has ruled out largescale military action analysts note 
that the jungle and mountain terrain would make military operations 
difficult and costly 
thai officials say there has been no substantial pressure on 
them from washington to move against khun sa 
burma is unlikely to cooperate given washingtons denunciation 
of the military junta that seized power after brutally crushing a 
prodemocracy uprising in 1988 washington stopped its 
antinarcotics aid program to rangoon in protest 
khun sa now is engaged in one of the perennial conflicts of the 
triangle the rugged largely lawless territory where the borders 
of burma laos and thailand converge 
this time khun sas army is trying to stop the potentially 
powerful wa tribe from muscling in on his territory 
the wa one of burmas multitude of ethnic minorities broke 
away from the outlawed burma communist party which had emerged as 
a major narcotics producer and trafficker in the 1980s 
khun sa has general control of areas near the thai frontier 
which allows opium transported from deeper inside burma to be 
processed into heroin at border refineries 
from these border refineries the heroin is smuggled through 
thailand to the united states australia western europe and asian 
points 
according to official us estimates the triangles opium crop 
in the 198889 growing season amounted to 2600 tons about 85 
percent of it from burma a similar amount is expected this year 
washington has focused on the drug deluge from latin america and 
the socalled golden crescent of pakistan and afghanistan which 
had supplied much of the heroin to us addicts 
at least 40 percent to 50 percent of heroin imported into the 
united states now originates in the triangle much of it bearing 
khun sas imprint 
some knowledgeable observers speculate the us indictment was 
not so much a prelude to direct action against khun sa as a message 
to thailand and burma 
melvyn levitsky the top state department narcotics official 
has criticized corruption in thailand which allows drugs to cross 
the country in vast quantities and burmese government connections 
with drug warlords 
khun sa believed to have been born in 1932 emerged as a 
narcotics trader in the 1960s he claims to be a freedom fighter 
for burmas shan minority who must use narcotics to finance his 
rebellion 
on several occasions he has offered to sell the opium crop to 
the united states and keep it off the illicit market 
he has survived numerous battles and five years in prison in 
1982 he was driven out of his thai stronghold complete with 
swimming pool and plush quarters and into burma 
the thais have a 19000 reward on his head but his links with 
thailand remain 
he buys weapons on the thai black market for his army of 4000 
to 10000 men his aides openly operate businesses in tungsten 
jade and timber across northern thailand and he is known to have 
close ties to many provincial officials 
thai narcotics sources acknowledge privately that corruption 
among police army and government officials facilitates the 
trafficking 
maj gen chavalit yodmani who heads the office of the 
narcotics control board said the key to eradicating drugs in the 
triangle is solving burmas ethnic minority problems 
khun sa is just one person chavalit said in an interview 
you can indict twenty khun sas but another one will simply 
spring up to take their place

the huge production costs and star salaries 
of the summer films have aroused fears that the film industry is 
headed down the same road as americas savings and loans 
dont worry advise the makers of the 50 million total 
recall which is set for release in 2000 us theaters tdoay 
says arnold schwarzenegger whose salary was reportedly 10 
million as long as you can bring the money back thats the key 
thing in hollywood if someone would pay me 100 million in salary 
and they would get back 400 million they would do it with 
pleasure wouldnt you i would 
the numbers dont matter the only thing that matters is can 
you return this money twice or three times over sometimes studios 
make a movie for 5 million then they put 10 million in for 
promotion and they lose it all because its a bad picture this is 
how studios eventually go bankrupt 
adds director paul verhoeven we made it pretty cheap by going 
to mexico city shooting in los angeles im sure that the movie 
would have cost 70 million or something like that we started the 
budget at 43 million and i think i went over 15 percent so its 
probably up to 50 million i always go over 15 percent even in 
europe where i made films for half a million 
i always seem to go over a bit more than the producers want to 
give but its all on the screen its not something that fell in 
the water or disappeared into somebodys pocket its all there 
i dont think you feel the fiscal responsibility as a 
director you know that you cant make it for 5 million or even 
40 million the decision is economic the producers must decide 
can we do this movie with all the special effects and by adding 
arnold schwarzenegger make our money back if that possibility 
exists they go for it 
a company like carolco makes a lot of presales with a name 
like arnolds and my name which is pretty well known in europe 
they can say look what we have the director of robocop and 
arnold schwarzenegger can we please sell this movie to you so 
they get a lot of money already from the presales then they can 
say we can do it 
total recall has been in the works for 10 years originating 
in a short story by phillip k dick we can remember it for you 
wholesale dino de laurentiis developed the script which 
intrigued schwarzenegger in the mid1980s 
it was the best script i had read in years he recalls 
when i picked up the script the first time i couldnt put it 
down i read it all the way through then i read it again the 
whole business of memory being erased and another memory implanted 
was fascinating 
set in the year 2084 total recall depicts schwarzenegger as 
an earth laborer who enrolls for a memoryimplant vacation and soon 
finds himself enmeshed in a civil war on mars de laurentiis was 
unable to find a director for the film and sold the project to the 
enterprising carolco maker of the rambo films schwarzenegger 
agreed to the choice of verhoeven as director he has the right 
mentality for it the discipline the knowhow 
the martian world was created on the stages of churubusco stdios 
in mexico city with the designs of william sandell included is the 
tawdry redlight district of venusville with its glaring neon and 
an occasional touch of whimsy such as a jackinthebox sign 
mexico city itself provided the locations for earth 100 years from 
now 
we used the mexican style called new brutalism with all the 
concrete stuff very threatening with little windows 
aztecstyle said dutchborn verhoeven 
there will be new things in the 2080s but there will be 
things that you can compare with today especially when you come 
from europe where in every city you can see buildings that are 
four five 600years old so there is always a combination of 
the old and new 
generally i dont think the world changes that much it will 
be a bit larger the style will change a little bit buildings of 
egypt 4000 years ago are not much different from what you see 
today people still need a roof if its raining

its midaugust youre too hot to go out 
grab a glass of something cool park in front of the tube and 
consider the choices 
a third repeat of i married dora the second showing of that 
fabulous manimal episode in which the lead character turns into 
a tiger or wait hold onto your sun visor what about the fourth 
special encore presentation of that moonlighting episode where 
maddie sleeps with mark harmon 
theres been a cure for the summertime rerun blues its called 
flipping the dial to a network where there are myriad firstrun 
programs to chose from and that means not flipping to abc cbs or 
nbc 
it took the big three a couple of years to swallow this little 
pill it went down only after fox broadcasting co stole 
significant numbers of viewers last year while the big boys over at 
the mondonetworks took their usual summer naps 
the alternative fox network not asleep at the wheel has taken 
to calling last years coup the summer of opportunity 
this year they plan to maintain yearround original 
programming two new shows have been announced for the summer as 
well as more fresh episodes and specials of shows such as cops 
americas most wanted and the critically acclaimed in living 
color 
cable networks such as home box office like to take credit too 
for increasing their viewership by running original programming 
during the summer 
the networks are definitely reacting to cable television 
said hbo spokesman richard licata cable is definitely eroding 
their ratings shares 
the sleeping giants have stirred and this summer abc cbs and 
nbc are pumping more money into summer programming than ever before 
but its not a whole lot and even though the big three are 
making a big deal out of their summer programming with few 
exceptions its still pretty meager fare 
abc will show unseen episodes of the recently canceled 
brewster place starring oprah winfrey and capital news 
starring lloyd bridges its few new summer shows include new 
attitude about a beauty salon and the game shows super 
jeopardy and monopoly 
rather than produce a large slate of fresh shows abc instead 
has spent between 10 and 20 million increasing episode orders 
of existing shows said network spokesman jim brochu 
over at the no 1 peacock network which barely held on to its 
toprated status during may sweeps nbc programming gurus have some 
interesting ideas for summer 
entertainment president brandon tartikoff announced this week 
that repeats of quantum leap one of his favorite shows would 
be shown at 10 pm edt for five consecutive nights beginning june 
25 new programs include singer and sons starring esther rolle 
and the seinfeld chronicles starring comedian jerry seinfeld 
because there are so many choices no longer can you just 
simply go away and not come back until the fall said nbc 
spokeswoman sue binford putting that into practice is very very 
tough were not going to get there completely this summer 
at bottomrated cbs executives have little to say about the 
summer season theyre too busy trying to figure out their fall 
schedule and how to get out of last place 
but the battered eye is the only broacast network to have an 
executive in charge of nothing but summer programs so far cbs has 
announced three new programs for the hot months to come 
one is war room about white house speech writers another 
is northern exposure about a new york doctor forced to work in 
alaska to pay off his medical education in manhattan nights 
which still is in production summer viewers will peek at the lives 
of residents in a fictional new york apartment building 
by having original programming on in the summer were trying 
to attract viewers back to cbs said mike eisenberg network vice 
president of research were trying to reduce viewer erosion 
it is a simple fact that less people watch television in the 
summer according to eisenberg the number of prime time viewers in 
july 1989 was 18 percent less than in january of the same year 
there are several reasons the weather is nicer and people take 
vacations 
might it also be that summer tv was lousy to begin with 
dont run to the lodge without reservations just yet but as the 
networks pay more attention to hot weather programming could an 
august sweeps period be far behind

the diehard karen rebels have been 
squeezed into shrinking frontier enclaves and may be down to the 
last battles of their 41yearold fight for autonomy 
it has been a long hard march for one of burmas many ethnic 
minorities most of it backward at the beginning in the late 
1940s karen troops swept through burmas major cities and even 
penetrated to the outskirts of rangoon the capital 
in the past two years the army has overrun most of the karen 
bases along the thai border and sent 28000 refugees fleeing across 
the frontier 
thailand eager to exploit burmas rich forests has struck 
deals with the government at the expense of the rebels hundreds of 
fighters have died on both sides in fierce jungle combat sometimes 
handtohand 
the opposition won the burmese national elections last weekend 
but it is not certain how that will affect the karen war or when 
the military government will relinquish power 
among the last karen strongholds is the border town of 
manerplaw capital of territory the karen call kawtoolei 
manerplaw probably one of the worlds most idyllic guerrilla 
bases sits on the moei river at the foot of miststreaked hills 
its neat woodandthatch buildings house 12 government 
departments of the karen national union including foreign affairs 
fisheries and mining karen leaders claim to command 10000 troops 
and govern 1 million civilians 
the karen fighters and a dozen other rebellious ethnic 
minorities with which they are allied do not seek independence but 
greater political and cultural autonomy 
if you consider it historically it is the worst situation we 
have faced but it doesnt mean the end of the karen revolution 
said ba thein general secretary of the karen national union 
he said the karen were switching to more classicstyle guerrilla 
warfare and would have little trouble operating in areas of eastern 
burma dominated by the karen minority a mobile headquarters 
would be organized if manerplaw fell to the burmese he said in an 
interview 
ba thein also expressed hope for internal political change in 
burma 
we are not alone he said all the people in burma are 
struggling for freedom we believe that if democracy comes all 
the ethnic minority problems with be solved 
burmas military which brutally crushed a prodemocracy 
uprising in 1988 has shown remarkable tenacity 
the loss of border bases has greatly reduced the karen national 
unions income from taxes levied on frontier smuggling which was 
used to buy weapons 
in contrast the 200000member burmese military has restocked 
its arsenal with funds from teaklogging concessions granted to 
thai businessmen 
burmese control of the border is now in the interest of powerful 
thais and rebel officers say some thaiburmese military 
cooperation has occurred 
the logging has been the death knell of the karen said a 
knowledgeable western observer in bangkok he noted that earlier 
friendly and mutually advantageous ties between the thais and karen 
had helped sustain the insurgency 
what some sympathetic westerners and thais have called the 
sellout of the karen fits a historical pattern 
although the karen have lived in what is now burma at least as 
long as the burmans they have been suppressed and looked down upon 
as savages and wild cattle of the hills 
the karen fought bravely alongside the allies in world war ii 
while a projapanese government sat in rangoon but promises of 
some autonomy were broken when burma gained independence from 
britain in 1947 
after the early successes of their insurgency the tide turned 
against the karen rebels and they were gradually forced into the 
border region 
there has been incompetence and some corruption among the aging 
rebel leaders who have not conducted a real guerrilla war and 
disparities in power and education between the christian leaders 
and their followers most of whom are buddhist or animist 
in 1984 the government stepped up its campaign and three years 
later announced it would destroy the karen national union within 
two years that has not happened but two words often heard when 
the rebels discuss the future are dark and bleak 
i am 63 and have fought all my life ba thein said my 
children have now joined the revolution perhaps the next

how can surveys show no credit crunch on a 
national scale when so many businesses complain about financing 
restrictions 
it will be a year before enough hard data are available and 
analyzed to say whether or not a national credit crunch exists 
today which means of course that the answer will be too late for 
practical purposes of policy 
meanwhile anguished shrieks of pain can be heard from operators 
of startup companies from those involved in any way with real 
estate or building from companies with little collateral to offer 
and from otherwise solid outfits 
have their complaints fallen into that nomans land that 
intellectual desert where economists debate equivocate qualify 
and toss questions from one hand to the other and never reach even 
a tentative conclusion 
some help in resolving the apparent contradiction between 
those who rely on economic statistics and see no credit crunch and 
those small companies that complain of being squeezed almost to 
death can be found in phrasing 
most surveys for example make a distinction between a general 
credit crunch and regional ones a key phrase in this distinction 
is national credit crunch to many economists anything 
regional doesnt qualify 
surveys also tend to look at business in general whereas most 
complaints seem to come from small or mediumsize businesses which 
often use real estate as collateral some economists tend to think 
only in bigbusiness terms 
and it has been argued those companies that indeed are hurt 
even when they represent only a small fraction of the whole squeal 
so loudly there is a tendency to think the entire barnyard is in an 
uproar 
one of the most cogent explanations offered is that of economist 
william k macreynolds who makes a sharp distinction between a 
general credit crunch which he says may not exist and a 
specialized one which he says does exist 
macreynolds thesis developed for the us chamber of commerce 
is not a copout but an explanation while stating that to date 
there is no conclusive evidence that a general credit crunch 
exists he provides this observation 
however there is a clear sense from published economic data 
credit market behavior new credit availability bank examiner 
actions bank reactions and anecdotal evidence provided by bankers 
and smallbusiness people in more than half the states in the 
country that a credit crunch is underway 
in short and without awaiting statistical conclusions he 
declares there is indeed a problem out there 
he observes that larger companies with access to various credit 
markets have suffered the least even though many of them have had 
their credit ratings lowered and as everyone knows the junk bond 
market has collapsed 
smallbusiness credit providers he says are burdened by 
targeted bank examinations especially since the spate of bank and 
thrift failures and these examiners are especially critical of 
real estate collateral 
real estate is a primary source of collateral for small 
business bank examiners says macreynolds are asking banks even 
wellcapitalized community banks to get new appraisals and to 
write down the value of these loans 
if banks do not seek new appraisals or adjust existing loans 
with new collateral they are forced to write down the value of 
loans and report large losses he explains adding 
and while bank examiners and government regulators would not 
claim they wish to discourage good loans the pressure on banks is 
to withhold new loan approval 
even performing loans from longstanding bank customers whose 
ability to repay debt goes unchallenged can be classified as 
troubled because new appraisals have not been made 
that situation is exacerbated says macreynolds when small 
banks are taken over by larger ones then he suggests the 
smallbusiness customer might almost automatically lose its credit 
even with a good payment record 
conclusion in a general slowdown everyones capital tends to 
erode and asset values stop rising 
regulatory actions on top of a slowdown that discriminate 
against a class of borrowers regardless of their proven ability to 
repay loans make the situation worse to the point where a crunch is 
unavoidable

is dance in america alive and well 
its alive but not well says richard philp editor in chief 
of dance magazine 
no its isnt says choreographer agnes de mille its 
suffering from malnutrition there isnt any money 
and thats a catastrophe in her view because the wellbeing 
of the arts is a direct thermometer of our countrys spiritual and 
emotional wellbeing 
the function of art in our lives i think is vital its next 
door to food we have to have something 
in recent years dance companies throughout the united states 
like other organizations in the arts community have suffered from 
cuts in financing and reorganization some companies have virtually 
gone out of business 
in general what youre seeing is true throughout the arts a 
decline in funding due to the economy the mergers and acquisitions 
phenomenon and to a change in priority in some companies who now 
have an emphasis in the environment education and social causes at 
the expense of the arts said betsy hopkins executive director 
of the fundraising organization corporate fund for dance 
hopkins said that in general the nations 400 or so dance 
companies were healthy and not any worse off than other arts 
organizations 
theres a heightened interest in dance in this country she 
said but dance companies just dont tend to have big 
endowments 
the most recent upheaval in the world of dance has been at the 
joffrey ballet gerald arpino cofounder of the company with 
robert joffrey and artistic director since joffreys death in 1988 
resigned may 1 and said the company on the eve of a los angeles 
season couldnt perform his or joffreys creations 
arpino later said the company could dance his works starting may 
25 he resigned after the joffreys 55member board voted to 
establish a ninemember operating committee which would virtually 
eliminate his power and the boards power ten board members 
resigned immediately the vote came after the board learned that 
the company beside its 1 million deficit owes 800000 in 
payrollwithholding taxes 
negotiations continued and on may 23 an agreement was reached 
arpino whose resignation was never accepted continues as artistic 
director he will license his and joffreys ballets to the company 
an executive committee of 10 board members plus arpino will run 
daytoday operations 
during may board cochairmen david murdock in los angeles and 
anthony bliss in new york vice chairman frank lynch board 
president david holbrook and executive director penelope curry 
resigned 
earlier in the month murdock the millionaire who was 
instrumental in the joffrey adopting los angeles as a second home 
in 1983 offered to lead a threeyear drive to erase the joffreys 
deficit murdocks resignation may mean he rescinds that offer 
also the joffreys contract with the los angeles music center 
expires june 30 
last november the board defeated a proposal to name bliss 
wife sally a former dancer who headed the young joffrey ii 
company as artistic head of the company to whom arpino and curry 
would report 
the joffreys july 1729 engagement at the university of 
california at berkeley has been canceled however four 
performances june 79 at the spoleto festival in charleston sc 
remain booked 
american ballet theaters big upheaval came last year when 
mikhail baryshnikov abruptly resigned as artistic director 
baryshnikov had brought in jane hermann from an administrative 
job at the metropolitan opera to become executive director of 
american ballet theater she cut the seasons budget to 18 million 
from 23 million and instituted costcutting measures intended to 
reduce a 1 million deficit this led her to clash with and then 
remove charles france baryshnikovs personal assistant in support 
of france and citing artistic standards baryshnikov resigned in 
september from the company he had headed since 1980 
the dance theater of harlem danced a season at the kennedy 
center for performing arts in washington in march having canceled 
its may season here it laid off dancers technical personnel and 
some administrative staff saying 12 million could be saved 
cancellations in domestic and european tours had made the years 
projected deficit 17 million 
americas most renowned modern dance troupe the martha graham 
dance company also had to lay off dancers through february and 
march there was no money to pay them dancers returned in april to 
prepare for appearances in the united states spain and japan from 
may through august 
personality conflicts and power struggles may play a part but 
most observers agree the basic cause of turmoil in the dance world 
is lack of money 
i think the problem comes right down from the presidency and 
the national council on the arts they dont give enough money and 
they dont give it regularly enough theyre stingy said agnes 
de mille 
dance cannot support itself never did and never will the 
fine arts arent designed to pay for themselves in the early days 
lucia chase footed the bill for ballet theater lincoln kirstein 
still foots the bill for the new york city ballet rebecca harkness 
helped what became the joffrey ballet 
dancers are very special they have to be cared for very 
carefully and its expensive now theyre getting reasonable 
salaries before they starved 
money sources are drying up while operational costs continue to 
soar 
i dont know what the dance theater of harlem is going to 
do said philp the editor of dance the joffreys philosophy 
has been to present the best of 20th century dance historical as 
well as contemporary they may have to adapt 
after the dance theater of harlems shutdown became known it 
received nearly 150000 a third each from chase manhattan bank 
the new york state council for the arts and individuals so that 
its school could remain open the shubert foundation made a 
200000 challenge grant to the company a fundraising event will 
be held this month 
at ballet theater works by experimental moderndance 
choreographers and expensive new productions of russian ballets 
often were mounted during baryshnikovs tenure philp says of the 
latter the dancers didnt have the maturity thats necessary to 
project the heart and soul of certain roles 
in the future american ballet theater apparently intends to 
emphasize antony tudor and agnes de mille dancedramas and to 
develop stars wholl be boxoffice draws a fundraising 50th 
anniversary gala with top ticket price at 1250 was held in 
january 
while de mille praises the efforts of dance companies to pull 
themselves up by their own bootstraps she believes the government 
should see the need for vigorous interest and help i think our 
lives are terribly starved we have enough electrical gadgets but 
our brains are empty in large measure our spirits are empty if 
they werent we wouldnt have so many snarling people on the 
streets 
i think our government doesnt lead us she said i think 
they reflect what they think is the common will and they think the 
common will is for more soap operas and more crack 
we were blessedly fortunate with those men in philadelphia 
the founding fathers they were knowledgeable and they sat down and 
really deliberated and didnt have people telling them how many 
votes theyre get here or there

the members of dance theatre of harlem see 
themselves as different from those in other toptier ballet 
companies united on a mission to bring the fine arts to people too 
long out of their reach 
but this summer the dancers have found themselves thrown apart 
laid off for six months by a combination of bad luck and economic 
reality 
losing 15 of the minimum 40 weeks theyre accustomed to working 
each year the dancers worry about paying their rent meeting other 
bills and keeping in shape and they worry whether their company 
can come out of this in one piece 
im very concerned that this interuption is so long that its 
going to be hard to rebuild suddenly said virginia johnson a 
principal ballerina and the companys star who has been with the 
troupe for 21 years 
i am very worried about the individual dancers and if the 
company as it was is going to be able to survive will they be 
able to leave what they found in the interim 
johnson considers herself lucky having quickly lined up guest 
performances with the garden state ballet in newark nj and the 
washington ballet in washington dc she also plans to continue 
work on her college degree she took a leave of absence 20 years 
ago from studying history 
the lithe delicate dancer thinks about modeling or maybe 
working as a receptionist she takes dance classes when youre a 
dancer and youre used to dancing eight hours a day you just dont 
feel like the same person if youre not taking class 
she insists however that she has not considered quitting the 
troupe its not just a job its not just a place that we go to 
dance its a place that we feel we make a contribution to solving 
some of the worlds problems 
arthur mitchell a former principal dancer with the new york 
city ballet cofounded dance theatre of harlem in 1969 as a 
commitment to the harlem community after the assassination of the 
rev martin luther king jr 
from the start the troupe challenged racial stereotypes and 
proved that blacks can dance classical ballet the company prides 
itself on preserving american dance repertory demonstrating a 
variety of styles and moods from the classical swan lake to 
george balanchines neoclassical allegro brillante to 
mitchells modern holberg suite to the folk ballet john 
henry 
in 1988 the troupe captivated audiences in the soviet union 
with its magical retelling of john taras firebird set to the 
original igor stravinsky score 
now considered among the countrys top professional ballet 
companies dance theatre of harlems commitment to its mission 
remains as strong as ever 
when not doing regular performances the dancers conduct 
workshops for disadvantaged youths introducing them to the arts 
and the discipline they require and particularly to classical 
ballet one such audience included members of rival los angeles 
street gangs 
were trying to be positive role models to all the youth 
in the united states says eddie j shellman a principal dancer 
who joined the company in 1975 and plans to stay even after he 
stops dancing 
were very close were all related because were all going 
for the same thing which is a sense of pride giving the best that 
we can give just raising the companys selfesteem which happens 
at every performance he said 
shellman is spending the layoff teaching ballet working on a 
license to teach dance as a substitute in new york public schools 
and preparing for his wedding to fellow dancer endalyn taylor he 
is living partly off his savings 
lowell smith a principal dancer whos been with the troupe for 
13 years is trying to break into acting as hes always planned to 
do 
he intends to dance full time again when the company resumes 
but at 36 hes also realizing he may soon be seeking a more 
permanent alternative 
mitchell felt dance theatre of harlem was somehow safer than 
other nonprofit arts companies partly because it earns a 
relatively high 50 percent of its budget 
but the middle fell out of the companys scheduled european tour 
when an arts festival in leeds england was canceled after its 
artistic director died and its london booking was lost because the 
venues regular occupant had a schedule change then an american 
sponsor had to cancel the companys dates in san diego for 
financial reasons 
facing a potential 2 million deficit and a spring new york 
season that traditionally loses money the only way the company 
could show fiscal responsibility was to curtail activities 
mitchell said 
the company laid off about 80 fulltime dancers technicians and 
administrative members of a full and parttime staff that totals 
140 cutting the budget for the fiscal year that ends sept 30 to 
53 million from 76 million special grants from chase manhattan 
bank and the new york state council on the arts allowed the 
companys school to keep going 
performances were canceled from april except for one 
fundraiser the company plans to resume oct 1 provided the board 
sees the fiscal year end without red ink and sees a significant 
start toward 2 million in the bank 
mitchell is optimistic but some dancers especially younger 
ones worry he wont be able to bring everyone back 
andre levitt 26 who joined the corps last year reluctantly 
admits hes been auditioning for other dance troupes 
i dont want to but you have to be careful he said im 
too young to guest now for the rest of my career i should be in a 
company learning things 
meanwhile he tries to make ends meet on what he says is the 
bottom salary rung levitt normally earns 495 a week unemployment 
brings him 225 a week 
a threeweek guest appearance with a virginia company brought 
him 500 total 
it was really frustrating levitt said of the layoff i 
guess i thought that with a bigger company like dance theatre of 
harlem that things like this just dont happen 
sophia cannonier feels even more vulnerable shes still a 
probationary apprentice not yet under regular contract still a 
student and on a stipend the layoff cost her half her check 
but still a citizen of bermuda she has no work permit and 
still a student she has had to spend at least four hours a day in 
class and rehearsing for an open house leaving little time to work 
even off the books 
it keeps me busy it keeps me in class she says it keeps 
my hopes and just my adrenaline going 
cannonier 20 plans to go home and live with her parents this 
summer shell guest like some other members of the company with 
the bermuda civic ballet a former beauty queen she plans to do 
some modeling 
and she says she will return 
i ultimately want to be in dance theatre of harlem 
cannonier said i love what they do how they perform and i want 
to be a part of that just the way they move their rapport 
their style

in the world of tutus and toe shoes red is 
particularly hot this season barely a week seems to pass without a 
mention of some dance companys financial woes 
the problems arent particularly new to nonprofit organizations 
everybodys always been struggling said stephanie french 
vice president for corporate contributions and cultural affairs at 
philip morris companies inc but somehow it seems that theyre 
more severe now 
giving budgets havent gone up so much but everybodys 
operating budget has all the requests are for more money 
trouble comes to all sizes and all regions 
at the joffrey ballet which has homes on both coasts 
longsimmering artistic vs administrative conflicts were brought 
to a head this spring by a deficit growing toward 2 million 
in a power struggle artistic director gerald arpino resigned 
taking his works and those of the late robert joffrey with whom he 
founded the company in 1956 numerous board members including 
french also left arpino and the works have returned the deficit 
didnt leave 
at the cleveland ballet fast growth helped cause an 
accumulation of red ink particularly in the last five years that 
is hard to wash out 
american interest in dance blossomed in the 1960s and 70s 
thanks largely to the ford foundation fostering ballet training and 
companies nationwide headlinegrabbing defections of glamorous 
soviet dancers such as rudolf nureyev and mikhail baryshnikov also 
helped 
but now audience growth is leveling while costs are not and 
companies find themselves in an increasingly competitive fight for 
money 
douglas sonntag senior program specialist in the dance program 
of the national endowment for the arts notes that many companies 
of various sizes are flourishing artistically and financially 
such as the new york city boston houston and pacific northwest 
ballets 
if a dance company earns more than 30 percent to 40 percent of 
its income thats really quite good sonntag says 
but it isnt always enough 
dance theater of harlem has been earning 50 percent of its 
budget says cofounder and artistic director arthur mitchell but 
this year emergencies unrelated to the company cost it three 
scheduled appearances two in the middle of a european tour 
that erased 12 million then an anticipated 150000 in grants 
turned out to be 50000 
seeing red mitchell the executive director and the board took 
emergency evasive action they called a sixmonth layoff canceling 
the remaining european dates as well as the companys new york 
season that though important for prestige traditionally loses 
money 
the 14yearold cleveland ballet has been growing by leaps and 
bounds its budget for the fiscal year ended last june 30 was about 
7 million more than double that of five years before its deficit 
was 13 million this year also is expected to close in the red 
the cleveland ballet earns 65 percent of its income spokeswoman 
christine patronikholder says the rest is contributed and as is 
the case with many other dance companies the cleveland ballet has 
no endowment 
the company has found its niche in fulllength theatrical 
ballets that are expensive to mount even though it makes most 
costumes and scenery inhouse 
but ticket sales have gone down patronikholder says rent for 
theater studio and office space is 600000 a year 
growing pains have been costly in 1988 the cleveland ballet 
presented itself in chicago to good reviews and a 600000 loss 
now it performs only in cleveland and its other home city of san 
jose calif unless assured of at least breaking even 
philip morris french believes the answer lies in arts companies 
finding a broader donor base especially among individuals but 
its not a good time for donations 
at the national endowment for the arts the dance program budget 
has remained at about 9 million for several years sonntag says 
about twothirds of that goes to dance companies grants range from 
10000 to 400000 but they have to be matched 
in the private sector where profits have been sagging 
corporations that sponsor the arts are demanding more marketing for 
their money he said that poses problems for arts groups that 
cant afford to give disproportionate credit to any single source 
today individuals corporations and foundations with any money 
to give face a devastating array of causes that address fundamental 
social needs such as homelessness aids and crackaddicted babies 
they are hitting at a much more basic level of need in our 
society than cultural improvement says sonntag we have to 
have homes before we have theaters

in turin italy the roman catholic church has 
six official exorcists to cast out demons magicians seers faith 
healers mind readers astrologers and others dabbling in the 
occult advertise regularly on television has satan established a 
stronghold in the ancient city famous for its religious icons 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
real or imagined the devil is tormenting 
this sober industrial city in northwestern italy 
some believe a sinister presence lurks in the shadows along the 
citys broad arcaded boulevards and haunts the medieval squares in 
the nearby mountain hamlets of the piedmontese alps 
the city likes to be remembered as the former seat of the house 
of savoy dynasty the first capital of a unified italy the resting 
place of saints and religious relics the home of the fiat auto 
empire 
its also the home of the shroud of turin which some believe 
was the cloth with which joseph of arimathea wrapped the body of 
jesus christ after his crucifixion 
but turin has a darker reputation as a haven for satan and his 
disciples 
there is no proof of course but what is certain is that the 
city has six official exorcists an underground core of devil 
worshipers and thousands of people dealing in the occult 
specialists in the occult maintain that turin forms part of two 
magic triangles representing good and evil 
along with prague czechoslovakia and lyon france the city is 
reputedly a center of white magic a positive force turin is 
also said to join london and san francisco as a stronghold of 
black magic which is considered harmful or diabolic 
turin has always been a place of great spiritual and magical 
ferment says giuditta dembech a journalist and author of the 
book torino citta magica turin magic city it has some of 
the qualities of places like mecca jerusalem and lourdes 
the city first attracted widespread notoriety as a devils 
playground four years ago when turins archbishop at the time 
cardinal anastasio ballestrero appointed six official exorcists 
exorcism the process of casting out demons is an accepted 
practice in the catholic church pope john paul ii has frequently 
stated that the devil is a pervasive reality in todays world 
the naming of the six exorcists in turin followed a directive 
from cardinal joseph ratzinger prefect of the vaticans 
congregation for the doctrine of the faith for churches to 
exercise greater control over exorcisms 
unfortunately some of our priests had gone a little too far 
and were performing exorcisms too hastily says canon giuseppe 
ruata who heads turins pool of official exorcists 
two events in 1988 further contributed to the citys satanic 
image 
first the pope spoke of the devil during a visit to turin 
saying from the history of salvation we know that where there 
are saints there is also another person who presents himself not by 
his name but the name of others he is called the prince of this 
world the demon 
then a month later turin hosted a weeklong conference on 
demonology that bitterly divided local politicians churchmen and 
academics 
church officials deny turin has a greater problem with the devil 
than any other cities pointing out that milan tops italy with 
eight exorcists of its own milan has a population of 15 million 
compared with turins 1 million 
turin has an image it doesnt deserve ruata 74 said in an 
interview at the archdiocesan offices i wouldnt make turin out 
to be the capital of the demonic empire 
most agree however that turin has an unusually high number of 
magicians seers faith healers mind readers astrologers and 
others dabbling in superstition and witchcraft they advertise 
continuously on private television and radio 
there are more than 100 of these types of agencies in turin 
ruata says they charge 400 as the initial fee for removing a 
spell its a huge form of trickery

ruata says he is approached every day by people who believe they 
are possessed by the demon nearly all he says are people with 
psychological problems or are superstitious 
actual demonic possession occurs in perhaps 2 or 3 percent 
of the cases ruata says he says he has personally performed only 
one real exorcism 
real diabolical possession involves a great aversion for the 
sacred he says the possessed will spew out terrifying curses 
and speak foreign languages which they never learned sometimes 
levitation occurs they rise up then fall back like a sack of 
potatoes its horrible then the phenomenon goes away and they 
dont remember anything 
while there are people in turin who turn to the church to combat 
demons there are others who pay devotion to satan in secret 
ritualistic ceremonies 
ruata says devil worshipers have robbed churches of hosts the 
bread consecrated for the eucharist and other objects for use in 
black masses 
gianluigi marianini a turin television personality political 
figure and demonologist claims the city has 40000 satanic 
followers 
the ones ive known are everyday people says marianini 71 
stroking his white goatee they dont give any outward sign of 
anything they just have this dark corner of their lives they are 
usually people who are frustrated with their lives and choose this 
parallel religion out of disillusionment 
dembech the author disputes the 40000 figure 
its already hard enough to find 40000 perfect christians 
she writes the real satanists in this city can be counted on one 
hand 
turins devil worshipers have sometimes left behind signs of 
their activities 
last year for example a satanic cult was blamed for 
desecrating an ancient church in the suburb of pianezza plundering 
the tombs of clerics buried there centuries ago and using the bones 
for some macabre ritual 
the bones were found scattered around the church and some 
tombstones were crushed 
marianini says several young girls found murdered in the 
countryside south of turin in recent years have born signs of 
ritual sacrifice the girls were killed by sword or dagger their 
money and jewelry were untouched and there was no sexual assault 
he says 
marianini says hes seen basement temples used for black masses 
they are equipped with a black marble altar an upsidedown 
crucifix black candles and wooden balls which are said to 
contain pieces of human hearts he says 
during black masses according to eyewitness accounts 
participants at times show up hooded and the ritual sometimes ends 
in sexual orgies 
an example of the undeserved attention given the devil occurred 
in 1988 when the murders of a young turin couple were blamed on a 
satanic ritual drawing such lurid headlines in the normally staid 
local newspaper la stampa as fear of the devil killed them 
last month a court put an end to the hysteria ruling they were 
victims of a cocaine ring the devil acquitted said la stampa 
the rev john navone an american theologian at the pontifical 
gregorian university in rome believes satanism is no more 
prevalent in turin or italy than in other modern industrial 
societies 
what about los angeles or miami or seattle he asks i 
think there is probably more satanism in the united states than 
italy the fact that it is a scandal in italy is perhaps a sign of 
the societys health

more than 35 million adults with mental and physical handicaps 
it would help people like bill and myra when they confront old 
stereotypes such as the common assumption that parents with 
disabilities will necessarily bear similarly disabled children 
dr pasquale accardo coauthor of when a parent is mentally 
retarded says it depends on the individual whether retarded 
parents are able to give their children a wellrounded upbringing 
but he says his studies indicate that less than onethird of their 
children are born retarded 
people still have irrational fears says accardo a 
professor at st louis university school of medicine 
bill and myra are helping educate the public 
they are familiar fixtures in their hometown just outside 
boston meeting people while on their weekly trip to the 
supermarket standing in line to catch a batman matinee or 
having a hamburger at the brighams coffee shop 
a lot of people look at someone like myra and bill and think 
its nice they can do for themselves barbee says but others 
think differently 
some people underestimate what bill and myra can do for 
themselves they think they have to speak louder or gesture wildly 
some people dont understand that retarded adults are not exempt 
from the human range of emotions 
disabled people can be scary even to each other 
bill much like myra had reservations when they first met in 
1974 at a supervised workshop after four decades of living in his 
parents home he wanted to prove he could live on his own 
but he also harbored memories of a previous girlfriend who had 
whipped him across the face with a belt and threatened his one good 
eye with a lit cigarette 
i wanted to know why she was in the hospital for all those 
years and she explained how she used to be really nervous and did 
damage to her mother and friends he says 
i just looked at her and thought should i or shouldnt i 
he says and then i said to myself im going to try it 
again 
soon they were sharing cokes at a nearby holiday inn listening 
together to the songs of elvis presley or taking the bus to spend 
sunny days at salisbury beach sometimes they would take drives 
with myras parents up to vermont or maine 
they were growing closer and soon they became lovers 
when i was growing up i figured i would never move out on my 
own and always be a burden myra says reaching for bills hand 
id never know how to cook or sew im dumb im stupid 
thats what i thought now i know some other things and billy 
does too

its the last wish of hundreds of terminally ill 
children to visit walt disney world or one of the other tourist 
attractions in central florida now they can thanks to the efforts 
of a death camp survivor and a lot of other individuals and 
corporations 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as a boy of 13 in a nazi concentration 
camp henri landwirth learned what its like to wait fearfully for 
death at an early age 
at 63 he believes hes been living the past 45 years on 
borrowed time 
so feeling a need to give something back hes now helping 
make dreams come true for terminally ill children 
the slim whitehaired landwirth a survivor of the infamous 
death camp at auschwitz is the founder of a vacation village 
called give kids the world a special retreat for children whose 
last wish is to visit walt disney world sea world or one of the 
many other tourist attractions in central florida 
because of his efforts combined with the generosity of some 
major corporations and individuals hundreds of terminally ill 
boys and girls come here every year with their families all it 
takes is for the sick child to ask a local group in his or her 
hometown 
they spend a week at the complex each family in one of the 32 
villas at the yearold village 
seventyfive percent of the dying children want to see mickey 
mouse landwirth says citing statistics compiled from visitors 
eighty percent of the families never left their home state and 
just as many will never travel again as a family so this trip is a 
lifetime vacation 
families can do all the major theme parks or whatever they 
want each kid gets a gift every day we have a big party local 
restaurants provide food the disney and sea world characters visit 
and entertain we have volunteers working with the kids 
the village is located in the rural countryside less than a mile 
from busy us highway 192 near disney world it has a playground 
a pool designed for the handicapped a fishing lake a mock pirate 
ship and a large cafeteriafamily center 
we never turn anyone away and we can accommodate a family on 
very short notice because the greatest enemy of these kids is 
time says the softspoken landwirth 
landwirth came to his role as benefactor through the 
determination he acquired as a youth to survive the jewish 
holocaust 
he and his twin sister margot were separated from their 
parents and sent off to separate concentration camps in 
germanoccupied poland in the early days of world war ii their 
father max was killed soon after his imprisonment their mother 
fanny was among more than 1000 female prisoners herded aboard a 
ship that was blown up at sea just weeks before the nazis 
surrendered to the allies 
after five years of imprisonment young henri managed to escape 
and spent about a month hiding and wandering homeless sick 
hungry and scared finally three days after the war ended he was 
taken in by a family in a small czechoslovakian village 
after his recovery landwirth hitchhiked back to a small town in 
poland where he had learned his sister was living after her 
repatriation together they returned to belgium where they were 
born and he emigrated to this country in 1949 
soon after his arrival in new york where he worked briefly as a 
diamond cutter landwirth was drafted by the us army during the 
korean war 
after his discharge he went to hotelmanagement school under 
the gi bill got married and eventually got a job in a miami beach 
hotel as a bellboy 
hard work paid off in better jobs and soon he was manager of the 
starlite hotel in cocoa beach at the time the nations space 
program was gearing up in nearby cape canaveral 
landwirth became innkeeper to the nations original crew of 
astronauts the mercury seven virtually the entire space hierarchy 
and journalist corps moved into first one and then another hotel he 
operated during those early years 
he became friends with astronauts john glenn alan shepard and 
scott carpenter and media personalities such as walter cronkite 
all of whom would later serve on the advisory board of give kids 
the world foundation

we were like a family says landwirth recalling the 
exciting infant days of the space program 
glenn now a us senator from ohio went into partnership with 
landwirth in the hotel business in the orlando area in 1970 soon 
after disney world began operating the two were franchise holders 
for three large holiday inn motels for years 
they still own one in kissimmee and are planning to build a new 
hotel at the disney community of lake buena vista 
landwirth and the astronauts also became founding members of the 
mercury seven foundation which provides annual scholarships for 
upperlevel college students specializing in aerospace science and 
engineering fields 
landwirth who has a long history of philanthropy first became 
interested in helping terminally ill children when as a hotel 
operator he provided free rooms for some of the kids and parents 
who were brought here on an occasional basis by volunteer groups 
around the country 
i remember two kids died while waiting for arrangements to be 
made for a visit to disney world landwirth says it took so 
long to coordinate efforts for airline transportation lodging 
free tickets at the attractions food and all of the other things 
i decided something had to be done 
landwirth used a foundation he had created in his mothers name 
as financial backing for his idea to act as a clearinghouse to make 
all local arrangements for the lastwish trips 
he first contacted disney officials three years ago and they 
enthusiastically agreed to help 
they were fantastic he says to this day theyve never 
said no to anything and they are our biggest supporters and 
contributors from money to services and people and all the 
special things that they do and do not publicize 
after that sea world cypress gardens and other attractions got 
into the picture on a permanent basis along with holiday inn and 
some 40 other businesses and groups large and small area hotels 
continued to furnish accommodations until the village was built and 
dedicated last year 
the 35 million in construction costs came from donations with 
17 million coming from holiday inns corp and its employees and 
18 million in labor and materials from area businesses and the 
community said julia h wylam director of development 
landwirth calculates the value of the goods services tickets 
gifts and other items provided directly to the kids and their 
families last year at 3 million 
there are some 150 wishgranting foundations around the world 
that identify the children provide administrative and medical 
assistance and roundtrip transportation for their visits here 
many of the kids write landwirth and the village staff after 
their return home 
you are a wonderful man wrote teenager amy johnson from 
phoenix shortly before she died of leukemia 
children are supposed to be our future but kids like me dont 
have futures we just have memories memories of our past youre 
in my prayers for remembering us little people 
lisa and jack mcdonald of lewiston maine who brought their 
5yearold daughter kristin to the village in march wrote 
our visit to the kids village allowed us as parents to share 
our experiences hopes and fears with other parents who are 
undergoing very similar actions and emotions in their respective 
lives 
landwirth now devotes most of his time to the village 
this is my life now im fulfilling a spiritual need he 
says 
i love this country i love whats happened to me here this 
is more rewarding than anything i have ever done

in the 40 years since arthur miller first 
adapted henrik ibsens enemy of the people as a protest against 
mccarthyism he has reverted back to the secondary theme of the 
centuryold play a warning about environmental pollution 
miller has moved the play from a 19th century norwegian village 
to a turnofthecentury health spa in maine in a new staging for 
american playhouse on pbs it will have its premiere on 
wednesday 
its really a prophetic play says miller who is in los 
angeles to help with the taping of the play by kcettv 
jack obrien directs this version which stars john glover and 
george grizzard as brothers who end up on opposite sides of an 
issue 
glover plays a doctor who discovers that a tannerys faulty 
waste disposal system is polluting the towns water supply and is 
causing an epidemic of health problems when he makes this public 
the townspeople led by grizzard the mayor turn on him for fear 
it will harm the towns reputation as a health spa 
in 1950 when miller adapted the play for broadway it spoke out 
against sen joseph mccarthys campaign against domestic communism 
but the times have changed and the play is now seen as a cautionary 
tale about pollution 
i saw the ibsen play in london last year and realized why the 
ecology theme had such an impact miller says but that wasnt 
why ibsen wrote the play ecology was hardly important in norway in 
the last century it was the right of someone to speak the truth 
against the will of the majority 
ibsen wrote an enemy of the people in 1881 after reading a 
newspaper account of a scientist who was vilified for reporting the 
pollution of a towns water supply 
the tourist dollars theme also was used by peter benchley in 
jaws it told of a police chief who faced opposition from the 
mayor and townspeople when he tried to close a seaside resorts 
beaches because of attacks by a great white shark 
one of the reasons i chose to adapt this play in 1950 was that 
fredric march asked me to do it at the height of the mccarthy 
era miller says in that same period i wrote the crucible 
which is a parable of the mccarthy era 
miller is also discussing an adaptation of the crucible with 
executives of the arts amp entertainment cable channel 
obrien artistic director of the old globe theater in san 
diego says what miller has done is give enemy of the people an 
american spin 
bringing the play to america figures only obliquely in the 
story because arthur has such respect for ibsen obrien says 
arthur has written the dialogue in quintessential american 
cadence but the relevance of this play written so long ago is 
scary 
i just did anton chekhovs uncle vanya which was written in 
1892 it has a huge speech about conservation and ecological 
disasters you would absolutely believe that play was written 
today the same thing with arthurs adaptation so why shouldnt we 
take advantage of it 
obrien at the globe theater since 1981 puts on 12 to 15 shows 
a year enemy of the people is the fifth play hes directed for 
the american playhouse

playwright peter barnes recalls that about 10 
years ago critics were complaining about the length of his plays 
in frustration he tried radio he liked it 
barnes is not alone in writing regularly for both stage and 
radio the list includes such names as tom stoppard arnold wesker 
and harold pinter 
not only does radio offer exposure it attracts big names 
barnes wrote for radio one of the late laurence oliviers last 
roles no end to dreaming his radio work has enjoyed the 
luxury of talent such as dame peggy ashcroft paul scofield and sir 
john gielgud 
with the notable exception of david mamet few major playwrights 
in the united states bother with radio drama but several 
expatriate american writers have found a hospitable environment on 
the british airwaves 
craig warner a 25yearold american based in london has had 
three radio dramas produced by the british broadcasting corp he 
says he has now written more radio plays than he ever heard 
broadcast when he was in his native los angeles 
warners by where the old shed used to be won a giles cooper 
award as one of the five best radio dramas of the past year 
for many the bbc and radio drama are synonymous besides 
serials and soap operas the network produces an average of 500 
radio plays a year 
two commercial stations radio clyde in scotland and lbc 
crownfm in london also program radio drama 
finlay welsh drama producer at radio clyde acknowledges that 
audiences and financial returns are small 
however he said in an interview its very important that an 
independent radio station not simply produce news and music 
programs but also make a definite and deliberate contribution to 
writing and acting 
radio dramas heyday dates back to dylan thomass under 
milkwood perhaps the bestknown radio play ever it lasted until 
the mid1960s 
those were the days when the theater was under censorship there 
was no alternative fringe theater to pick up the slack 
the very important thing is to nurture writers says john 
tydeman head of the bbc radio drama department pinter still 
writes tom stoppard is writing a pla for us they can say things 
in a certain way on radio and we are discovering new people all 
the time 
some are first surprised then delighted to find themselves 
writing for radio 
peter barnes series barness people began on bbc radio 3 in 
1980 
radio was a ball because they just asked i delivered and 
they put it on he says 
barnes notes that radio plays are made in three or four days 
compared with the eight years it took for his awardwinning 1985 
play red noses to get produced at the royal shakespeare company 
arnold wesker the noted british playwright of roots and 
chips with everything was commissioned to write his first 
radio play bluey in 1984 it was about a judge on the verge 
of a nervous collapse 
i got my education from radio but i never really thought 
about writing for radio he recalls 
wesker found he enjoyed the genre 
i was using sound in a way that couldnt be used so 
effectively elsewhere the sound of wind and rain the sound of 
building sites the sound of words echoing through the judges head 
which finally assemble and tell him what had led to his 
breakdown wesker says 
a second radio play yardsale was later performed as part 
of a double bill on stage 
wesker says he would write more if the money were better even 
the most successful radio dramas pay a fraction of the 35000 to 
50000 or more that a hit play can generate for its writer 
david zane mairowitz an american writer based in france says 
hes one of the few people in the world who can live off radio 
drama his plays are produced first in britain then translated and 
sold on the continent 
mairowitz 47 says he was drawn to the imaginative demands of 
radio 
a radio listener is someone who has to produce the images in 
his mind in his head whoevers listening is responsible for 50 
percent of the input of whatever hes listening to 
mairowitz like warner also received a giles cooper award this 
year for the stalin sonata about a female pianist imprisoned 
during stalins 1937 purges 
sometimes radio is a steppingstone to the stage agatha 
christies longrunning the mousetrap began on radio as three 
blind mice tom stoppard wrote his 90minute artist descending 
a staircase for radio only to have it turn up last december on 
broadway where it flopped 
simon gray whose quartermaines terms and the common 
pursuit have been hits offbroadway used radio as the medium to 
revise his london play melon 
i found myself changing a few scenes and suggested we should 
give it a whirl on radio he says 
gray rewrote it for bbc radio 3 under the title the holy 
terror a name it will retain for its broadway bow next january

it won the velvet revolution 
runs the government and smiles on every village from its happyface 
symbol but civic forum has tough competition in the nations first 
free elections since 1946 
polls show it leading but with less than a quarter of the total 
vote civic forum appears likely to lose to the christian democrats 
in slovakia the more rural and roman catholic of the two 
constituent republics 
campaigning began officially april 29 with rallies posters on 
practically every available surface and endless spots on radio and 
television each of 23 parties fighting for seats in the federal 
parliament and the czech and slovak legislatures gets four hours of 
time 
czechoslovaks will vote friday and saturday 
few differences are evident among the parties all reject the 
communist past including the communists all favor a market 
economy and parliamentary democracy 
civic forums membership cuts across the political spectrum it 
claims to be neither left nor right and emphasizes its wellknown 
personalities including president vaclav havel experience and 
authority as leader of the november revolution 
in the din of conflicting election claims muddied further by 
accusations of past connections between leading figures and the 
communist secret police polls show one in four voters undecided 
and have the the communists running third 
as elsewhere in eastern europe the communists are under fire 
from all the others despite the partys new advocacy of democratic 
principles 
civic forums competition comes from a flock of new or remodeled 
parties chief among them the christian democrats buoyed by recent 
centerright victories in east germany and hungary 
we shall win but i dont know how big it will be said 
jana ryslinkova a mathematician who speaks for civic forum i 
think it wont be less than 30 percent 
havel civic forums biggest asset with voters is officially 
setting himself apart from organization he helped found on grounds 
his office requires impartiality 
the immensely popular president does help indirectly by 
participating in events organized by civic forum he opened its 
indooroutdoor exhibit on recent czechoslovak history which draws 
large crowds 
under a new proportional system a party whose candidate list 
gets 5 percent of the vote nationally is guaranteed representation 
in parliament up to six parties could qualify forcing civic forum 
to make a powersharing arrangement 
parties variously describe themselves as right center or 
centerleft but the main distinctions involve economic control and 
social benefits 
leftist parties such as the communists socialists and social 
democrats favor slower conversion to capitalism and some retention 
of benefits the christian democrats reject any degree of 
socialism empasizing their identification with christian values 
and tradition 
some civic forum leaders want to retain elements of socialism 
a survey released by the state polling organization may 20 said 
civic forum was supported by 269 percent of voters while the 
christian democrats had 164 percent and the communists and greens 
98 percent each in slovakia christian democrats led civic 
forums slovakian arm by 291 percent to 131 percent 
in november civic forum seemed to be the countrys only 
authentic political force its rallies attracted hundreds of 
thousands of people and persuaded communist leaders to step aside 
peacefully 
since then the government it dominates has improved 
czechoslovakias image abroad negotiated a deal for withdrawal of 
soviet military forces by june 1991 and erased myriad symbols of 
the old order 
radical overhaul of the economy must wait until after the 
election however in part because of divisions in the government 
over how fast to go 
ms ryslinkova the civic forum spokeswoman said the edge goes 
to civic forum over parties offering similar programs because 
what we have more than the other parties is the people able 
to lead 
hoping to overcome it is the christian democratic alliance of 
the peoples party formerly allied with the communists the 
christian democratic party in in the czech republic and the 
christian democratic movement in slovakia 
the alliance has joined forces with associations of wouldbe 
entrepreneurs and farmers and appeals to those with christian 
values said miroslav bartos a peoples party candidate and one of 
the parliamentarians appointed in december to replace resigning 
communist deputies 
communist spokesman josef hora said his party which ruled from 
1948 until last year might get 10 percent to 12 percent of the 
vote the party claims a membership of 900000 in the population of 
155 million 
hora complained that critics dont take the partys renewal 
seriously and still blame it for the repressions of the past

dick tracy the movie opens in nearly 
2000 theaters june 15 amid a media megablitz that rivals last 
summers batman 
but will warren beattys film about the squarejawed flatfoot 
with the yellow fedora match the 252 million domestic gross 
amassed by the caped crusader 
fingers crossed walt disney co is tossing a huge premiere at 
disney world in florida with 3000 journalists expected to attend 
following trailers that have appeared in 2000 theaters since 
christmas tv commercials will be unleashed on the nations 
networks merchandise including tracys wristwatch radio will 
flood the market 
but skeptics point to some negatives 
the comic strip dick tracy once featured in 500 newspapers now 
appears in 150 and is little known by todays young moviegoing 
audience and whats worse the young crowd hardly knows beatty 
53 who has made only two films in nine years the last being the 
quintessential bomb ishtar his other was the critically 
acclaimed reds in 1981 he costarred with diane keaton and 
received an academy award for best director 
another problem is that although dick tracy costar madonna 
may be a megastar in pop music her last few movies were 
megadisasters shanghai surprise and whos that girl 
however barrie osborne executive producer of dick tracy 
takes an upbeat view 
the picture should attract a wide audience because it can be 
appreciated on different levels he said in an interview the 
younger audience can enjoy the prosthetic characters pruneface 
flattop etc lots of action and beautiful color and they 
certainly know madonna 
the older audience can appreciate the wit and the appearance 
of the film much of it was derived from postexpressionist 
paintings a three penny operabertolt brecht look and 
warren can bring that older audience as well 
disney plans to issue graphic novelizations sprucedup comic 
books of dick tracy to bring some sort of awareness to the 
movie and character 
dick tracy was the creation of chester gould who drew 
cartoons for chicago papers he began submitting comic strip ideas 
to joseph patterson publisher of the new york daily news gould 
finally clicked with plainclothes tracy a hawknosed 
straightarrow detective who patterson renamed dick the strip made 
its debut in the detroit mirror on oct 4 1931 and the daily news 
eight days later 
the comic strip featured blood bullets and a menacing menagerie 
of villains with memorable names flattop flyface measles 
mumbles and more have threatened the intrepid twofisted tracy for 
nearly 60 years 
tracy his sweetheart tess trueheart and his grotesque enemies 
became american icons in the 1930s and 40s lowbudget movies and 
serials and a shortrun tv series helped fill the countrys 
fascination with goulds denizens of the underworld 
dick tracy according to beatty had its beginnings in 1977 
when producers art linson and floyd mutrux bought film rights from 
the tribune syndicate they made a deal with paramount pictures 
which enlisted universal pictures to coproduce various packages 
were proposed including projects with directors steven spielberg 
john landis richard benjamin and walter hill and stars harrison 
ford clint eastwood richard gere tom selleck and mel gibson 
beatty became involved in 1983 but paramount reportedly balked 
at his pay demands five years later michael eisner and jeff 
katzenberg had moved from paramount to disney and they revived 
tracy with beatty adding certain fiscal restraints ishtar 
cost 40 million 
no one at disney is saying how much dick tracy cost reports 
range from 23 million to 30 million considerably less than other 
summer epics such as total recall a reported 50 million 
die hard 2 60 million plus and days of thunder 55 
million plus 
it was a modestly budgeted film insists executive producer 
osborne a veteran of such bloated budgets as apocalypse now 
and the cotton club both made by francis coppola 
it was all filmed on the back lot and on sets that were 
constructed the film was made on budget within the contingency 
the contingency according to reports was that beatty would 
have to sacrifice part of his take for exceeding the budget 
osborne 46 who began in films as a directors guild trainee 
joined dick tracy in september 1988 he had not worked 
previously with beatty but he soon learned how the 
producerdirectorstar operated 
warren acts as a conductor said osborne he is very 
collaborative likes to get people together and listen to their 
ideas then he selects what he wants 
the look of the film was his idea he wanted to achieve the 
same quality of the sunday comic strip when there was a red it 
was the same red throughout the same green etc it took some 
convincing when cinematographer vittorio storaro and production 
designer richard sylbert came on board 
the limitedcolor pallette was hard on costume designer 
milena canonero she came in with cloth samples in 10 shades of 
blue 10 shades of green warren told her he wanted one shade only 
it was a tough challenge but it helps the film the production 
design of most films is anchored in reality because of the 
grotesque characters in dick tracy we needed devices to tell the 
audience that it was not reality 
a major attraction of dick tracy is the appearance of 
wellknown stars in wild makeups osborne believes they go 
unbilled but their identities are an open secret al pacino as mob 
boss big boy caprice dustin hoffman as mumbles james caan as ribs 
among those who are billed glenne headly tess trueheart mandy 
patinkin 88 keys charles durning police chief brandon william 
forsythe flattop dick van dyke the district attorney paul 
sorvino lips manlis estelle parsons mrs trueheart 
beatty considered several actresses for the role of the 
seductive moll breathless mahoney before deciding on his close 
friend madonna who argued that the role was similar to her own 
onstage persona beatty agreed eschewing the usual readings and 
tests 
madonnas biggest challenge she says in publicity material was 
singing the five stephen sondheim songs it was a great learning 
experience for me because when i first heard the music i panicked 
i cant sing these songs theyre too difficult i said 
but stephen was very helpful and generous and gave me a lot of 
encouragement they are great songs i wish i could write songs 
like that 
beattys challenge says osborne was directing the actor warren 
beatty it is actually not impossible to direct yourself warren 
was able to watch a video playback after each scene but mostly he 
relied on the reaction of people around the camera like richard 
sylbert and vittorio storaro 
dick tracy was tested before audiences away from major film 
centers in large cities and the reaction was great said 
osborne only a few cuts were made to tighten the film to its 
100minute running time 
then the labs started turning out the 200 70mm sixsoundtrack 
prints that will play major theaters and hundreds of 35mm 
twotrack versions that will appear in the rest of film houses in 
the united states and canada 
all that remains to be seen is whether or not dick tracy will go 
from funnies flatfoot to big screen scream

the warren beattymadonna movie may be 
attracting a lot of hoopla but dick tracy is no newcomer to the 
screen 
tracy purists may prefer dick tracy meets gruesome circa 
1947 in which the fabled flatfoot does battle with the great boris 
karlorff or maybe dick tracy vs cueball a lowbudget 1946 
flick in which the detective takes on a bald smuggler 
then there are two other rko features of the mid1940s that 
starred ralph byrd or morgan conway as the steeljawed hawknosed 
sleuth or see dick tracy as an fbi agent in dick tracys 
gmen a 1939 yarn with byrd chasing the evil zarnoff 
if you have the patience you could watch four serials dating 
from 1937 to 1941 with byrd as chester goulds comicstrip hero 
beattys rediscovery of dick tracy follows the pattern of recent 
hollywood times filmmakers have been exploiting longestablish 
characters of comic strips and books giving them a modern look for 
todays audiences batman is the biggest success story thus far 
created by bob kane in 1939 batman flew onto the big screen 
with serials in 1943 and 1949 the sensation of the 196567 
television series led to a 1966 feature also starring adam west 
and burt ward last year a hypedup batman starring jack 
nicholson and michael keaton proved a huge moneymaker 
superman dates back to 1940s serials a 1951 quickie 
superman and the mole men and the subsequent tv series starring 
george reeves christopher reeve took over the cape in the 1978 
epic superman it was a huge hit followed by three sequels 
with diminishing results 
little orphan annie first hit the screen in 1932 with mitzi 
green as the carrottopped waif then gloryoskee annie 
became a hit broadway musical in the 1970s its success was 
repeated in a 1982 movie directed by john huston of all people 
and starring albert finney carol burnett and bernadette peters 
not all comic heroes and heroines have done as well in recent 
years flash gordon was an expensive failure in 1980 helping 
along the eventual collapse of dino de laurentiis american 
enterprise popeye bombed in 1980 despite the best efforts of 
robin williams to imitate the oneeye spinach fancier brenda 
starr with brooke shields as the resourceful reporter remains 
on the shelf after three years partly because of legal tangles 
brenda starr was made by new world pictures which has since 
gone out of business there are disputes over new worlds assets 
and whether or not the movie will be released depends largely on 
how the disputes are resolved but the film has appeared in some 
overseas countries 
motion pictures and comic strips were born at about the same 
time and almost immediately began their association hearst 
cartoonist winsor mccay drew his little nemo for the screen in 
1911 and followed with gertie the dinosaur in 1914 krazy 
kat bringing up father and the katzenjammer kids were

would any hip teen be caught dead wearing a 
tshirt plastered with the profile of a forgotten comic strip cop 
warren beatty may still cause some female fans to swoon but the 
star and director of dick tracy faces a far more difficult 
seduction in the youthdriven movie merchandise business 
young shoppers are starting to inspect goods decorated with the 
likeness of madonna who costars as breathless mahoney in dick 
tracy but beattys title character has remained an elusive sale 
some retailers and manufacturers say 
and while the film itself continues to generate much 
anticipation dick tracy wares are lagging behind retail 
products linked to the simpsons teenage mutant ninja 
turtles and other tv shows and movies 
dick tracy will in no way come close to batman said 
nancy overfielddelmar manager of special event and merchandise 
publicity for jc penney the movie may do very well in 
theaters but there is no awareness in stores right now 
john green president of dick tracy tshirt licensee village 
mews said walt disney co has been slow to promote the film with 
little expenditures for billboards television spots and posters 
from a retailers point of view thats not very good green 
said the batman hype was going a year before the movie came 
out a lot of kids still dont know who dick tracy is 
marketing evaluations a research firm that studies the appeal 
of celebrities and fictional characters found in a study last year 
that dick tracy ranked below average his popularity was below 
wonder woman howdy doody and archie 
larry carlat the editor of toy amp hobby world believes young 
shoppers will be more interested in barbie and nintendo video games 
than beatty and madonna but playmates a leading toy manufacturer 
thinks dick tracy will outsell batman 
as movies batman and dick tracy share several common 
elements both are based on longstanding comic strips both have 
been adapted into liveaction films and both feature recognizable 
central characters 
yet the merchandising of the two films is wholly different 
jack morrow vice president of licensing for applause inc 
makers of dick tracy dolls figurines mugs and key chains 
said warner bros positioned its batman as a fad not just a 
movie the logo thus became a statement unto itself 
tracy didnt have the same warmup that batman had and i 
attribute that directly to fashion that yellow and black design 
was cool and tracy doesnt have that morrow said 
dick tracy merchandise retailers and licensees say will 
live or die on the films performance if the movie soars so too 
will the products if it bombs then you can look for dick 
tracy products on the discount shelf 
willow could have sold a lot of merchandise if the movie was 
good said gary caplan a licensing consultant howard the 
duck could have sold a lot of products too if the movie had 
played well 
according to trade estimates batman merchandise so far has 
claimed retail sales of 650 million a studio typically enjoys 10 
percent of the wholesale revenues generated by the merchandise to 
which it holds the copyrights 
in 1980 licensed products had retail sales of 99 billion by 
1989 that figure had surged to 646 billion about 3 billion 
worth of merchandise inspired by movies and television programs was 
sold last year 
even if dick tracy produces wholesale receipts of 100 
million disney will collect 10 million for doing essentially 
nothing but negotiating deals and approving artwork and if kids 
wear tshirts bearing the films logo disney has walking 
billboards touting the movie 
among the estimated 100 merchandise licenses are yellow fedoras 
wrist walkietalkies stretch satin evening wear as worn by 
madonnas breathless mahoney character shower curtains drapes 
backpacks jewelry and a variety of watches there also will be 
three movierelated record albums 
will dick tracy be able to get his man at the cash register 
so far it looks like a tough case

triumph of the spirit rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 
8995 rated r 
 
triumph of the spirit is as subtle as a right to the jaw 
and at times just as powerful 
at other times it swings and misses 
a holocaust film that came out late last year triumph of the 
spirit was nearly forgotten thanks to the nearsimultaneous 
releases of the acclaimed enemies a love story and the 
costagavras drama music box 
but triumph couldnt be more different while those films 
are about memory with the holocaust a nightmare lurking 
offscreen triumph shot on location in auschwitz dares to 
show the unshowable 
the film is based on the true story of salamo arouch the 
middleweight boxing champion of the balkan countries in 1938 after 
the nazis occupied greece he and his family and friends were 
deported to auschwitz arouch used by the nazis to box with other 
prisoners survived and now lives in israel with his wife children 
and grandchildren 
triumph is relentless deliberately hard to take with no 
time for the soulsearching of enemies or music box 
they promised us a new life in poland arouch willem dafoe 
recalls as he speaks nazis are squeezing greek jews into cattle 
cars and shipping them off to their new life in auschwitz 
blows big and small rain down the nazis take their valuables 
shave their heads and make men and women wear the same drab 
uniforms prisoners are kicked literally out of bed each morning 
and drag themselves back at night beaten down by a day of marching 
and lifting 
screaming matches break out over a pair of shoes a woman breaks 
down and cries as she begs her friend for a few drops of broth 
when arouch steals a moment with his girlfriend allegra wendy 
gazelle he embraces her as if he were a starving man sniffing a 
loaf of warm bread 
the final solution is never far away gas chambers hangings 
commanders coolly selecting the next round of victims 
arouch however is spared he kos a guard who pushed him down 
a hill and becomes a valuable commodity to the commanding officers 
who bet on him in boxing matches with other prisoners arouch wins 
every fight 
so triumph becomes a story of triumphs physical moral 
and spiritual arouch is bloodied but not defeated 
all i have left is my love for allegra he says after the 
camp has been liberated and his family killed shoulders slumped 
arouch exits down a long and empty road walking gingerly under an 
endless gray sky 
if this video comes up short dont blame dafoe excellent as a 
man who learns to duck punches in and out of the ring costars 
robert loggia as arouchs ailing father and edward james olmos 
the camp gypsy are both solid 
but dafoe has to keep a straight face with such lines as you 
still taste like apricots and how can we do this to our 
brothers 
the direction by robert young dominick and eugene is 
unimaginative and worse the music soars and swells like the 
soundtrack of an old bette davis movie a symphony seeming to rise 
with every tear that falls 
how many rounds arouch asks when offered the chance to 
fight 
rounds the commander responds no rounds you fight until 
one cant get up 
triumph of the spirit lasts a full 15 give it a split 
decision

laredo mca steve wariner 
 
steve wariners easygoing laredo travels over some familiar 
country ground but comes up a winner on the strength of 
aboveaverage songs and the singers ability to convey that he 
clearly enjoys the material 
using three producers wariner shifts comfortably from midtempo 
ballads to lite swing maintaining a pleasant groove that 
falters only when he indulges in the sappy sentimentality of i 
wanna go back a needless lament for the good ol days 
wariner a staple on the country charts knows what makes a hit 
and almost everything else on laredo sounds groomed for the 
radio precious thing a bluesy love song the tearjerkers 
shes in love and there for awhile and the clever the 
domino theory appear likely candidates to receive airplay 
the band is tight the piano playing is superb throughout four 
keyboardists are credited and the digital recording is clear and 
uncluttered but not cold 
all in all a safe likable album if you have to go down the 
middle of the road steve wariners not a bad guy to have along as 
a rider

dog city grudge crack the sky 
 
with dog city crack the sky is guilty of one of rock n 
rolls deadly sins wrapping politically charged messages in dull 
plodding music 
this band has a lot to say but who can pay attention to the 
words when the music is putting them to sleep and despite the 
bombast here who can stay awake through this set 
this from a band that knows better 
never a household name crack the sky does enjoy some cult 
status largely on the strength of its 1975 debut which 
successfully mixed john palumbos delightfully bizarre songwriting 
with quirky imaginative guitarbased rock 
none of that here palumbos lyrical sights are on the nations 
social ills the homeless drug abuse violence but his words 
are lost in a mix of leaden hardrock cliches even if you agree 
with what hes saying you may find yourself wanting to join the 
other side 
only on mr president in which a childrens choir makes a 
plea for the government to do something about the homeless does 
the music break away from the muck its not nearly enough though 
to salvage this dog of an album

jump for joy alligator records koko taylor 
 
the queen of the blues meets the king of gonzo talk about 
strange bedfellows but in proving again that shes no pretender to 
the crown koko taylor rips into ted nugents hey baby as if it 
were one of her own maybe its not so strange after all rock n 
roll has its roots in the blues 
taylors 12th album jump for joy is a strong follow to 
1987s live from chicago an audience with the queen if 
history repeats itself taylor could be up for her second grammy 
award her last three releases have been nominated 
this is standard fare from taylor marked by tough fromthegut 
vocals and a solid band that boogies lonnie brooks slides in for a 
duet and some sixstring work on its a dirty job taylor mixes 
five originals with five covers 
the bulk of taylors blues are in the goodtime vein on time 
will tell however she sings with raw emotion that makes her 
loss from the death a year ago of richard pops taylor her 
husband of 30 years nearly palpable

schooled since birth in the discipline of the 
theater amy irving sought interviews to promote her new movie only 
days before delivering her second child 
she already was the mother of one of the most famous and 
richest boys in the world max spielberg whose father is her 
former husband film tycoon steven spielberg irving and spielberg 
were divorced last year 
max now has a halfbrother gabriel davis baretto born may 4 to 
amy and bruno baretto director of her new film max also has 
another halfsibling since spielberg and kate capshaw became the 
parents of a daughter sasha on may 14 but thats a different 
story 
like spielbergcapshaw barettoirving are not married but we 
plan to be declares irving 
her new movie is a paramount pictures release a show of 
force based on anne nelsons book murder under two flags it 
delves into the political intrigue surrounding the murder of two 
young men in 1978 in puerto rico the alleged coverup caused a 
government scandal that apparently still has reverberations 
the script is very close to the facts of the case irving 
said there was some license that we took in telling the story 
and there were some demands that we do not use real names there 
were rumors that the american government is trying not to expose 
this film too much because it does come down pretty heavily on them 
the fact that the two boys were set up to look like 
cubanbacked terrorists and then murdered in cold blood has been 
proven how high up the influence goes and who was involved is 
still under investigation 
the actress admitted her own ignorance of puerto rico before 
making the film i even asked what currency they used her 
stay there provided an education and she concludes with 
understatement i dont think that the situation there is one 
that america has helped 
like many of todays film heroines irving plays a television 
reporter a widow with two children her investigation puts her 
life in jeopardy puts her familys life in jeopardy and makes her 
question her own vision of what america was she seeks the truth 
and comes into her own strength in seeking the truth 
her role as kate ryan de melendez is the mainstay of the plot 
which also involves andy garcia as the prosecutor lou diamond 
phillips as an undercover agent and robert duvall as the television 
station manager also in the cast is irvings mother priscilla 
pointer 
with an actress mother and a father who was a distinguished 
stage director amy irving grew up in the theater the late jules 
irving was artistic director of san franciscos american repertory 
theater when amy was born in palo alto calif 37 years ago she 
made her stage debut at 9 months in rumplestiltskin trained at 
her fathers theater and later at the london academy of music and 
dramatic art 
over the years irving has divided her time between stage 
amadeus heartbreak house and screen carrie 
yentl crossing delancey daughter of one director and 
former wife of another it seemed inevitable she would fall under 
the spell of her a show of force director 
i met bruno before the film she related he flew up from 
brazil about a year ago march and we talked about the film i had 
seen his dona flora and her two husbands and he showed me other 
of his brazilian films he has made nine there all of his films 
have a central character of a very strong woman a woman who 
travels through some kind of journey in life in each one the 
performances were so impressive that i couldnt wait to be directed 
by him 
we had a wonderful experience making the film and afterward 
more happened it turned out to be a grand experience in my life 
after their marriage she says they plan to make their home 
here she also has a house in new mexico and he will keep his base 
in brazil 
a show of force is brunos first englishlanguage film and 
he plans to come to america and pursue his career here irving 
said he got tired of people reading his films all his films 
are subtitled outside brazil and portugal to be able to have 
people watch the faces as the story unfolds is something that hes 
wanted for a long time 
well go to brazil weve spent some time there and im 
learning portuguese his 13yearold daughter lives with us and 
our life is pretty international now max has already learned how 
to ask for a chocolate cookie in portuguese

grace lai stumbled into her artistic passion but 
she cant afford to stumble now 
lai spends much of her time 30 stories or more above the ground 
sometimes near open walls and elevator shafts just to get the 
right perspective for her paintings 
hardhat on head she totes her studio on a handcart painting 
watercolors of chicagos changing skyline and the workers who 
change it 
shes been working at the north state street site of the 
american medical associations new headquarters for about two 
years watching excavators welders steelworkers cement workers 
plumbers electrical contractors carpenters tilesetters 
pipefitters and more 
no one has ever tried to document what they do lai says 
this is something they can take home and show their wives and 
say look i really do work 
lai 62 and her husband harry operated acme studios at 
various chicago locations for 25 years until his death in 1985 she 
then decided to return to school and try to support herself with 
her art 
she sketched her first construction site in 1985 it was on her 
first day back in art school when her bus dropped her at the 
42story office tower at 190 n lasalle the first chicago building 
designed by the architect philip johnson 
transit schedules forced her to arrive two hours early for class 
at the american academy of art and she filled the time sketching 
several weeks later the chief site inspector noticed her liked 
her work and made her the official artist for the construction 
site 
the current building is the third site shes painted between 
johnsons building and her current site she climbed and painted 
the 50story tower at 35 w wacker drive that houses the leo 
burnett co advertising agency 
before she found her passion for painting construction sites 
she used the only subject of which she could think 
i used to just sketch people on the buses back and forth from 
visiting my father in the nursing home she says but it was a 
chancy thing if people found out you were sketching them and 
didnt like it you took your life in your hands but most of them 
were delighted 
her original watercolors sell for 400 to 500 she has 8by 
10inch prints made of each one and sells the prints to workers for 
15 to 40 she sells enough to get by she says 
she leaves space around the construction scenes in many of her 
works which she fills with portraits of individual workers or 
crews the workers often pose briefly during their coffee breaks 
when are you gonna do me gracie one worker asks any 
time she says they agree on a painting and a time and part 
company each expressing thanks 
john buck co and millerklutznickdavisgray co partners in 
the building plan to show her works at the buildings grand 
opening tentatively scheduled in august 
lai will have 25 to 30 fullsize watercolors ready all showing 
different phases of construction she hopes the show will bring 
recognition and a wider audience 
it will be her first show outside the pallet and chisel a group 
of chicago artists with a studio in the downtown loop who combine 
their efforts to promote local art her paintings now are available 
only at her inhome company advertising art and at the city of 
chicago store in the loop 
success for me would be being respected by fellow artists 
this may end up affording me a living but i dont want to turn out 
garbage she says 
most importantly i want to be an artist it doesnt have to 
be in construction id like to go into a paper mill or an atomic 
plant things people hear about and never see you have to be 
halfinsane to do it but my gosh can you find anything more 
exciting 
the excitement and potential danger of being hundreds of 
feet above the ground has never caused her any trouble says lai 
who signs a release at each site a contractor involved with each 
site has insured her under his company policy 
my only problems are off the site last year i spent four 
months on crutches because i was doing aerobics and i landed wrong 
so aerobics can go ill walk she said 
however the time on crutches was even helpful 
after i came back my painting changed entirely i became a 
lot more thoughtful i did whole scenes instead of just throwing 
things together i think it was being away for so long it made me 
realize what i was missing 
construction workers help her stay out of the way she says 
you kind of sense when things are starting to move and 
usually somebody will come by and say gracie scat she 
laughed again 
lai worked in december when she had to add alcohol to her paints 
to keep them from freezing and had to cut the fingers out of her 
gloves on her drawing hand to handle her pens and brushes 
and she didnt quit when her friends told her she wouldnt 
finish art school or when her classmates began placing bets on 
when shed drop out she graduated last year 
her tenacity has provided her with a living experience and 
friendships 
i know so many of my friends who say nobody ever comes to 
see me youve got to out and meet the world

after 35 years bo diddley wants his payday 
its nice to be called a legend it was fun playing the white 
house induction into the rock and roll hall of fame was 
flattering and telling center fielder bo jackson that he didnt 
know diddley was a laugh 
but now bo wants more bo wants cash 
i feel like america owes me something more than just saying 
oh the great bo diddley the 61yearold artist said in a 
recent interview 
elvis presley copied me and i used to wouldnt say anything 
about it when they found the white boy who could do what i was 
doing then they shoved me back in the corner and he went on to las 
vegas where all the money was but bo diddley never got a chance 
to get involved he says 
i have no bitterness against elvis or any other white 
entertainer that records black music but i think there should be 
some recognition as to where he got the stuff from dont come up 
and steal my stuff and say you wrote it because thats a lie 
its not just elvis who rode the bo diddley beat to success the 
trademark guitar sound that hes played during six decades anchors 
the whos magic bus bruce springsteens shes the one 
buddy hollys not fade away johnny otis willie and the hand 
jive elvis costellos lovers walk and george michaels 
faith 
diddley like other rhythm and blues artists in the late 1940s 
and 50s was paid a flat fee for his recordings and received no 
royalty payments on record sales but over the years hes found 
his music on records around the world in places i aint never 
heard of in my life 
but wheres the money he says the thing that hurts me so 
bad is that every time i come up with something it looks like 
somebody jumped on it they make money with it and i cant get 
arrested with it 
everybody says oh youve got such a negative attitude 
guys can always tell bo you shouldnt be hollering about that 
thats water under the bridge yes its water under the bridge 
but my kids were deprived of a lot of things because the water went 
under the bridge and im not at all happy about that 
diddley has been entertaining almost from the day he was born 
otha ellis bates on dec 30 1928 in mccomb miss he was later 
adopted by his mothers cousin and took on the name ellis mcdaniel 
which his wife calls him to this day 
when he was 5 the family moved to chicago where he learned the 
violin at the ebenezer baptist church he learned the guitar at age 
10 he entertained passersby on street corners taking inspiration 
from the rhythm and blues bands playing in local clubs 
in his early teens he played on chicagos maxwell street and 
acquired his stage name a moniker derived from a bo diddley 
a onestringed guitar for four years beginning in 1951 he played 
at the 708 club on the south side 
in july 1955 he was signed to the checker record label and his 
first single bo diddley was a success he appeared on the 
ed sullivan show shortly thereafter radio disc jockey alan 
freed called his music rock n roll 
i was first to be called rock n roll not little richard 
not elvis presley not buddy holly none of them i was the first 
one diddley says 
he stood out on stage with his homemade square guitar 
darkrimmed glasses black leather jacket and black hat with a 
diamondshaped turquoise pinned to the front 
im an entertainer im a showman im not a guitarist says 
diddley when youre dealing with cats like myself youre dealing 
with a real entertainer a person who knows what the stage is built 
for 
its not the same at home where hes ellis to his wife and bo 
pop to his grandchildren hes also no rebel off stage serving a 
stint in the 1970s as a sheriff in new mexico he considers himself 
patriotic 
im here baby im a piece of this dirt or whatever it is i 
didnt come from no africa he says 
sometimes he can be found building a porch in deboe fla for 
his 70by 24foot trailer home surrounded by rose bushes fruit 
trees and grass 
he says the home is so big it makes him feel like nobility 
but he knows what it can connote to some people 
its comfortable it doesnt bother me what people think 
because theres so many people that live in those trailers that got 
more money than bo diddley i am a regular person he says 
he is still paying for a large home in hawthorne fla which he 
moved away from when a previous marriage ended someone he says 
should do a benefit for bo diddley to clear him of his 300000 
debt 
at 55 i couldnt retire i couldnt even think about it he 
says 
meanwhile hell keep touring the country playing here and 
there and mostly near his home in the same sort of venues where 
hes been displaying his act for parts of five decades 
with all his business failings one of diddleys greatest 
achievements came last year when he was in the nike sneaker 
commercial 
the nike commercial did more for me than anything done for me 
in the last 20 years everybody knows bo diddley now just because 
i said you dont know diddley thats all i said i aint done 
nothing else i dont understand this part of it

the tall stranger rode into town and 
stayed because he found whats left of the code of the west was 
still alive in las cruces 
he packed no gun he had a typewriter 
a recent stanford university graduate school alumnus in 1966 
mark medoff drove into las cruces in a black 62 volkswagen beetle 
with no idea that he would become one of americas premier 
playwrights 
floridaborn medoff just turned 50 is a westerner now he 
teaches screenwriting playwriting acting and directing at new 
mexico state university and writes on his computer in the 
woodpaneled library of his spanish colonial home 
the author of the tonywinning children of a lesser god and 
obiewinning when you comin back red ryder says many of his 
plays are about old west values and the fall of the hero as medoff 
recalls from growing up in miami beach 
i think we dont have heroes in this country particularly 
anymore medoff said during an interview at his home we have 
demystified all our heroes we dont have people we look up to 
hes not particularly optimistic about what has replaced them 
his new play stumps is the second sequel to red ryder 
in it vietnam amputee stephen ryder and a wheelchairridden 
comrade try to sell a screenplay to a pornography producer a 
sociopath in clergymans clothing who brutalizes them and ryders 
vietnamese wife lin 
after two new mexico productions stumps is ready for larger 
venues and medoff has started sending it out 
the challenge of stumps was to create an educated 
articulate character without a conscience the rev calvin rhodes 
whod be seen as human not allegorical 
i guess my greatest fear about calvin rhodes is that hes not 
simply an aberration but that hes a kind of character we may see 
proliferate around us in our lives medoff says 
ryders luck has been lousy with sociopaths in when you 
comin back red ryder a gunman holds patrons of a desert diner 
hostage and wounds one the plays roots were westerns 
the bad guys ride into town they go into the saloon and they 
start tormenting the guy who drinks milk he says 
in the first sequel the heart outright we learn the gunman 
later was killed by state police 
but the author has met such bad guys only in his head ive 
always maintained that i have all the worst of my worst characters 
in me and i think we all do 
he recalls a happy childhood listening to the real red ryder on 
the radio along with the lone ranger and straight arrow 
my fathers a doctor my mothers a psychologist my father 
was a superb pianist my mothers a very fine painter the house 
was always full of music and art and books and it was a very nice 
upbringing a very civilized congenial upbringing and yet i 
think that in a way we in my generation all bridled against our 
very civility 
the wild one with marlon brando impressed him as a 
teenager in that film biker brando halfterrorizes 
halfmesmerizes a smalltown diner 
i was about 15 and looking at my uppermiddleclass jewish 
welleducated self thinking god i wish i had the guts and 
the wherewithal to put on black leather and get on a hog and go out 
and make trouble 
instead the 6foottall medoff channeled his aggressions into 
sports tore up a knee and had to quit football he now has a 
passion for golf 
he was also 15 when he started writing prose with support from 
his parents but with their warning about the vagaries of literary 
life he studied creative writing at the university of miami one 
of his stories was published by random house in prize college 
stories of 1963 he got his masters degree at stanford and 
accepted a position at first reluctantly at new mexico state 
it worried him that it was an agricultural school with cows 
right on campus but he soon found it a more diverse barnyard 
the first people he met were involved in the las cruces community 
theater 
one was actor bill frankfather who suggested medoff write a play 
and theyd put it on so i did and they did and that was the 
beginning 
frankfather played rhodes in the new mexico repertory theatre 
production of stumps this winter in santa fe and albuquerque 
the nurturing and support from campus and community and the 
spirit of the old west keep medoff in new mexico he likes his 
plays to succeed in new york but he prefers to stay here 
i have an affinity for the old west and i think theres still 
a residual civility here theres just something about the 
warmth of the people 
he met his wife stephanie in one of his literature courses 
they have three children debra 22 rachel 15 and jessica 11 
parenthood changed medoff as a writer 
the world is so much with us and the world is so full of 
violence and seems to be so much fuller today than it was yesterday 
of a lack of conscience that for my children i know im trying to 
write material that brings people face to face with that lack of 
conscience in hopes of fostering change he said 
when a brother of one of medoffs students was murdered several 
years ago medoff created the homage that follows which was to 
have been his statement on sociopaths 
but he became sympathetic to the killer even though what he 
did was unforgivable it became clear he was not without 
conscience 
so stumps was summoned up from the depths of his anger

keith whitley and lorrie morgan seemed 
the perfect pair when they married 
they were both singers with blossoming careers when she was 
away from home singing in concert he always sent flowers or called 
to ease the separation he planned to adopt her 8yearold daughter 
by a previous marriage 
morgan was the precocious child of a grand ole opry star and was 
so beautiful and talented she had been voted runnerup in the miss 
nashville pageant 
some people called them mr and mrs country music 
then whitley died last may of an accidental alcohol overdose 
morgan became a widow at age 29 losing her husband just as her 
career took off 
she recently talked about the past year a year filled with a 
lot of highs and lows in an interview in the conference room at 
rca records a room named in memory of her husband 
i finally have something ive waited for all my life the 
success of this career she said but i also lost part of my 
life that i had lived for and that was a fairy tale marriage with 
keith it was every womans dream to have a fairy tale marriage 
if i had to take my choice id rather have him than anything 
but its not my decision to make 
morgans album leave the light on was certified gold in 
may for sales of a half million placing it ahead of dozens of 
others including dolly partons highly promoted white 
limozeen morgans five minutes was a no 1 country music 
single in april dear me was another hit single last summer 
just weeks after whitley died 
at a time she should be exhilarated because of career 
achievement morgan finds herself searching to explain her frame of 
mind in a year of tragedy and triumph 
i dont know that im bitter she said you know that old 
saying god never puts anything on you that you and he cant 
handle theres a reason for all this ill probably never know 
the reason until i go up to heaven and ask 
confused is probably a better word as to why it happened 
the way it happened when it happened 
the night after her husband was buried she sang on the opry as 
a tribute to him 
it was real difficult she recalled it was difficult just 
to breathe to open my eyes it was something i felt i had to do to 
get on with life it would have been very easy to sit home and mope 
and cry and stay shut up in a room but i needed to be around 
friends not closed in 
within two weeks she was back on the road traveling to 
concerts she used her late husbands bus 
it was an eerie feeling i could picture him coming out of the 
back any minute 
five months after whitleys death she tearfully accepted his 
award on network tv for single record of the year from the country 
music association for his im no stranger to the rain 
this year it may be her own award she accepts her leave the 
light on has been in the top 10 of the country music charts 
she will have performed live before an estimated 12 million 
people by years end as part of a lengthy concert tour with country 
superstars alabama and the hottest country act in four years clint 
black 
two duets she recorded with whitley before he died will be 
released soon by rca 
morgan now is reaping the rewards of a singing career that began 
when she performed on the opry at age 13 at just 14 she was 
singing on the road with her father opry star george morgan at 
16 she had her own band and was a touring act 
ive paid a lot of dues learned a lot seen people come and 
go what to do and what not to do i think im ready for the 
success im having i guess this is the big final test when you 
have your exams morgan said 
im not sure i can point to the one thing for my success but 
a lot of years has helped 
whitley 33 has remained in the public eye because of the 
continued release of his songs 
hes going to be one of the greats morgan said there may 
be someone come around who will have more success than keith did 
but there never will be another better singer never

recent sharp increases in the prices of food 
staples have led several states to cut food allotments or drop 
people from welfare rolls 
the cost of milk orange juice cereal eggs and infant formula 
has risen 8 percent in the first half of this fiscal year four 
times the rate predicted by the federal food and nutrition service 
the new york times reported today 
the price increases have stretched the 21 billion that the 
federal women infants and children program spends on 45 million 
new and expectant mothers 
as a result the states which administer the program have had 
to either reduce the food allotment reduce the number of 
participants or both 
federal officials said they did not know how many people had 
been affected by the cuts the times said 
f phillip shanholtzer spokesman for the food and nutrition 
service said the inflation has outstripped everyones 
predictions 
officials blamed the price increases such as a 133 percent 
rise in the cost of orange juice and 59 percent for cereals on 
natural effects such as the drought of 1988 and the december freeze 
in florida 
texas and missouri are not accepting new cases both states said 
children who show no signs of clinical malnutrition will be cut 
from the program 
new york will try to cut its caseload by 20000 to 360000 
while connecticut no longer allows use of federal funds to buy 
orange juice suggesting instead that mothers buy apple or 
pineapple juice which cost less 
illinois officials however say their state is an exception to 
the national problem and will not have to cut any of its 162000 
recipients according to the chicago tribune which also reported 
on friday on cuts in the wic program 
congress has proposed a 150 million increase in the program for 
next year that money was meant to strengthen the program but now 
officials hope it will be enough to stay even 
the wic program provides poor families with food vouchers it is 
open to pregnant women those who have just given birth and 
children 
it serves 1 million women 14 million infants and 21 million 
other children under age 5 or about onethird of all babies born 
in the united states 
during the 1980s when other welfare programs were cut wic was 
spared because federal studies said it saved lives reduced infant 
mortality and prevented illness thereby sparing future expense to 
medicaid

concentrate on its flagship bottled water interests because it 
expects that market to expand dramatically in coming years

officials from 40 nations on tuesday signed a 
treaty creating a 12 billion development bank to finance eastern 
europes conversion to a market economy 
the european bank for reconstruction and development will be a 
catalyst between the capital and knowhow of the west and the 
businesses of the east french president francois mitterrand said 
at a signing ceremony 
mitterand proposed creating the bank last november as communist 
regimes crumbled across eastern europe he said the 42 founding 
nations would not reduce their individual support to third world 
countries 
the bank is expected to become operation in april 1991 the 12 
european community nations hold a controlling 51 percent interest 
in the bank although the united states is the single biggest 
shareholder with 10 percent interest 
eastern european countries will hold 135 percent interest 
under the banks statutes twothirds of the founding members 
must ratify the treaty before the bank can start lending money to 
countries in eastern europe that have embraced democratic 
principles 
the bank will allocate at least 60 percent of its loans to the 
private sector in eastern europe and the rest to public projects 
the fivemonth negotiations to create the bank were punctuated 
by disputes over the soviet unions membership and the choices for 
a venue and president 
early in the talks the united states raised objections to 
accepting the soviet union as a full member the dispute was 
resolved by allowing the soviets to join but limiting borrowing 
for three years to the amount of capital they contribute 
the netherlands led a rebellion by six other small western 
european countries against plans to locate the banks headquarters 
in london under the presidency of jacques attali of france one of 
mitterrands top aides 
dutch officials saying the big european powers were too 
dominant in multinational instituions lobbied in vain to have the 
bank based in amsterdam or to have former dutch finance minister 
onno rudding picked as president 
in paris last month attali was elected 328 over rudding the 
banks two institutional members the european commission and the 
european investment bank abstained 
london received 23 votes as the venue for the banks 
headquarters while amsterdam and copenhagen got five votes each 
the dutch kept their finance minister at home tuesday and sent a 
lowlevel delegation to the signing ceremony instead

a top us trade official on tuesday appealed to 
other rich nations to give a push to trade talks stalled by a 
dispute between the united states and european nations over 
government payments to farmers 
a window of opportunity is now us trade representative 
carla hills said a day before the opening of highlevel discussions 
by trade and finance chiefs of two dozen industrialized nations 
the possibilities are profound she said it just is going 
to take the political will to do it 
the officials are attending the annual meeting of the 
organization for economic cooperation and development they were 
expected to focus on the uruguay round talks an ambitious effort 
to revamp the world trading system 
the negotiations which involve about 100 nations are designed 
to reduce barriers to trade in agriculture textiles and other 
manufactured goods and in services such as banking and investment 
the bargaining began in uruguay in 1986 and is due to end in 
december but a fight between the united states and the 12nation 
european community over agricultural subsidies has raised concern 
the talks could end in failure 
the united states wants the ec also known as the common market 
to end import barriers and domestic and export farm subsidies that 
distort trade us officials estimate that ending the costly 
subsidies could boost us farm exports by 11 billion annually 
the common market give its farmers subsidies through guaranteed 
prices for many crops it also assists exporters so more expensive 
european farm products can compete with lower prices on the world 
market 
the community argues it has begun trimming farm aid but contends 
it cannot scrap the program entirely in 1988 european leaders 
adopted a plan limiting the maximum annual amount of expenditure on 
price guarantees over five years 
us officials have said the measures were not enough to fix 
what they deem a fundamentally flawed system 
agriculture is a key to the success of the round so that the 
europeans are going to have to decide whether they want a 
successful round mrs hills said 
she said about 1 trillion worth of commerce was not covered by 
international rules without regulations countries can use a 
variety of tactics some considered unfair by trading partners 
to sell their goods or protect them from competitors 
mrs hills said that if we dont get a deal in agriculture 
were not going to build the rules we need in these areas where 
there are no rules at all 
its just time that we do have rules for without rules we are 
a lawless international trading community she said 
the flow of textiles for instance is controlled by a network 
of tariffs and quotas not by the multinational trading system 
the uruguay round talks are held under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt is a forum and an 
agreement for promoting freer trade 
officials want to move talks along so lowerlevel negotiators 
can reach preliminary agreement in at least some of 15 areas under 
discussion at a july 23 session in geneva switzerland 
oecd members are australia austria belgium britain canada 
denmark finland france greece iceland ireland italy japan 
luxembourg the netherlands new zealand norway portugal spain 
sweden switzerland turkey the united states and west germany

the supreme court agreed monday to decide 
whether state laws that interfere unconstitutionally with 
interstate businesses also may violate federal civil rights law 
at issue in the nebraska case is whether states can be forced to 
pay lawyer fees and other legal expenses for businesses that 
challenge a states discriminatory taxes 
the case stems from an ohio truckers challenge of a nebraska 
truck tax mark dennis the owner of dennis trucking in royalton 
ohio sued the nebraska department of motor vehicles in 1984 over 
taxes imposed on truckers from states that imposed certain types of 
taxes on nebraskabased trucking businesses 
the taxes which are no longer in effect were imposed on trucks 
from arizona arkansas idaho nevada new york ohio oregon 
pennsylvania and wyoming 
nebraska courts ruled that the state tax interfered 
impermissibly with interstate commerce state officials were barred 
from collecting the taxes but the courts refused to treat dennis 
suit as a civil rights case which would have entitled him to 
recoup lawyers fees and other expenses 
the case is dennis vs higgins 891555

gov michael dukakis may try to make massachusetts 
the first state in the nation to divest its stock in tobacco 
companies a spokeswoman said tuesday 
right now were taking a serious look at it dukakis aide 
mari sullivan said 
dukakis last week asked aides to determine whether he can order 
the state to divest through an executive order or if the 
legislature needs to pass a bill according to a report in 
tuesdays boston globe 
antismoking activists say massachusetts would be the first 
state to take such action 
activists have mounted a nationwide effort to push states 
universities and hospitals to divest of tobacco holdings but 
tobacco industry officials have said they foresee little trouble 
for their stock although they do not completely dismiss the 
efforts 
harvard university last week announced a policy against using 
any of its nearly 5 billion endowment fund to invest in tobacco 
companies the city university of new york has a similar policy 
massachusetts holds 31 million in tobacco stocks as part of a 
29 billion pension fund managed by pension reserves investments 
management about 246 million is invested in philip morris co 
other holdings include us tobacco lowes corps and american 
brands inc 
in addition the state treasurers office has invested millions 
of dollars in tobacco stocks as part of a retirement fund for 
teachers and state employees as of april 30 the investment in 
tobacco stocks totaled 269 million 
the antitobacco drive had its genesis in a may memo in which 
secretary of human service philip johnston and public health 
commissioner david mulligan argued against the investments on 
health grounds

east germany plans to speed 
privatization of its industry as the nation lays foundations for a 
switch to capitalism its economics minister said tuesday 
economics minister gerhard pohl said only 180 of about 8000 
stateowned industries have been converted into publicly held 
companies so far 
if things continue like this it will take five years to 
reach total privatization pohl told reporters in bonn after 
meeting with west german economics minister helmut haussmann 
pohl said the east german parliament is to approve a legal 
framework by october to quicken the process he said incentives 
were planned for potential investors in now stateowned 
enterprises but he did not elaborate 
west germany has been pressuring east germany to quicken 
privatization as a source of revenue for economic reconstruction 
the two german states are to become a single economic entity as of 
july 2 
west germany will provide massive financial backing to start the 
possibly painful transformation of east germanys centrally planned 
economy into one based on freemarket principles 
for its part east germany has pledged to start selling off 
stateowned property to produce its own contributions for economic 
reconstruction there are fears privatization could result in 
eliminating many ailing businesses unable to withstand competition 
pohl and haussmann discussed plans to build a layer of small and 
mediumsized companies to form the backbone of the newly 
restructured east german economy 
pohl said his government plans legislation to increase fivefold 
the number of trainee positions available in industry starting in 
september 
he said it is too soon to say how many people will lose their 
jobs as uncompetitive industrial companies go out of business in 
the economic merger pohl said about 1 million people will have to 
be retrained under the new order

treasury secretary nicholas brady said tuesday 
that debtstrapped third world countries must reform their 
economies quickly to compete with emerging eastern european 
democracies for investors 
the incentive for the developing countries to move ahead 
vigorously with reform efforts has taken on additional urgency 
since the emergence of eastern europe brady said 
in the aggressive worldwide competition for foreign 
investment countries which fail to create an attractive investment 
environment run a real risk of lost opportunities and falling 
behind he said 
brady said the competition was for not only investment capital 
put up by commercial banks and other private interests but also for 
support from governments such as the united states 
we are committed to providing maximum possible support for 
marketoriented reforms in both regions of eastern europe and 
latin america brady said but lets face it the world is 
short of capital and governments are shorter still 
brady said the bush administration was channeling its aid both 
on a countrybycountry basis and through multinational lending 
organizations such as the world bank and the international monetary 
fund 
bradys remarks were made in a speech to the american chamber of 
commerce in london a text of the comments was released in 
washington 
brady praised the progress made under his 15monthold debt 
initiative in which commercial banks are provided incentives to 
forgive a portion of the 13 trillion debt being carried by third 
world countries 
so far six nations mexico venezuela costa rica morocco 
the philippines and chile have reached debtreduction agreements 
using guidelines of the brady plan 
brady said the commercial bank debt of the six nations accounts 
for nearly half the debt of the 16 largest debtor countries and 
that negotiations are underway to reach debt agreements with 
several other countries 
the crumbling of communist domination in eastern europe has 
grabbed the headlines but brady said revolutionary change has also 
been underway in latin america 
democratic elections in many latin american nations have 
produced a new generation of leaders committed to marketbased 
economic reforms he said brady addressed business leaders in 
london before traveling to paris for a ceremony establishing the 
new european bank for reconstruction and development aimed at 
providing assistance for eastern europe 
he also was leading the us delegation to the annual meeting of 
the 24nation organization of economic cooperation and development

copper futures prices plunged tuesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange as traders reacted to a labor accord reached last week 
between kennecott corp and its workers 
on other markets grain and soybean futures were mostly lower 
livestock and pork futures were higher energy futures gained and 
precious metals futures dropped 
last weeks agreement between kennecott and the united 
steelworkers union which represents the mining companys workers 
proved to be a drag on copper futures 
copper settled 210 cents to 410 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in may at 11585 a pound 
there had been been fears that a dispute over wages and benefits 
could result in strikes in the copper industry said jim steel an 
analyst with refco inc in new york 
the union settlement reduced the possibility of supply 
disruptions had a contract agreement failed to materialize before 
the june 30 expiration of the previous contract steel said 
the agreement makes it more likely that the other copper 
producers will reach accords with their unions he said 
grain and soybean futures were mostly lower on the chicago board 
of trade 
soybean prices fell sharply as professional selling set in 
during late trading the demand for soybeans and soybean products 
has been negligible said analyst joel karlin of research 
department inc 
what demand there has been is being supplied by sales in south 
america karlin said 
he said soybean futures also were pressured by continued wet 
weather in the midwest that has delayed corn planting forecasts 
have called for more rain later this week 
karlin said traders are concerned that the longer corn planting 
is delayed the more likely the acreage given over to soybeans will 
increase corn takes longer than soybeans to mature 
the weather outlook offered some support to corn futures as did 
scattered export business karlin said 
wheat prices gained on ideas among traders that wheat had been 
oversold in recent sessions analysts said 
wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents higher with july at 335 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with july at 
284 a bushel oats were 7 cents to 8 cents lower with july at 
146 cents a bushel soybeans were 8 cents to 14 cents lower 
with july at 606 a bushel 
thestrength of meat futures sent livestock and pork prices 
higher on the chicago mercantile exchange 
frozen pork belly futures closed up the 200 point limit in the 
wake of the us agriculture departments monthly cold storage 
report released friday which showed light movement of pork 
bellies into cold storage 
hog futures were higher gaining support from bellies and higher 
cash prices 
cattle futures were boosted by spillover buying from the pork 
pits 
live cattle were 10 cent lower to 55 cent higher with june at 
7407 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 20 cent higher 
with august at 8390 cents a pound hogs were 43 cent to 130 
cents higher with june at 6725 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 70 cent to 2 cents higher with july at 6785 cents a pound 
energy futures were higher on the new york mercantile exchange 
after rallying from a steep selloff in earlier trading analysts 
attributed the early selloff to an oversupply of crude oil 
however unleaded gasoline led a comeback on revived buying 
interest by major oil companies in the us gulf coast region and 
the firming of the european gasoline market said jim ritterbusch 
an analyst with painewebber inc in chicago 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 6 cents to 28 cents higher 
with july at 1798 a barrel heating oil was 32 cent to 58 cent 
higher with june at 5024 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 85 
cent to 238 cents higher with the june contract at 6579 cents a 
gallon 
precious metals futures were lower on the comex with 
followthrough selling of silver futures from fridays weak close 
pulling gold lower 
gold was 80 cents to 110 lower with june at 36740 a troy

chairman william jovanovich resigned tuesday 
from textbook publisher harcourt brace jovanovich inc three years 
after orchestrating a recapitalization that kept the company 
independent but left it heavily in debt 
fortythree years is enough the 70yearold jovanovich said 
in stepping down from his last major corporate assignment at the 
company he joined as a textbook salesman and editor in 1947 
he had been disengaging himself from the company over the past 
two years stepping down earlier as president and chief executive 
jovanovich will be succeeded as chairman by former us energy 
secretary john s herrington 51 who has been on the board of 
directors for a year 
his son peter jovanovich 41 was named president and chief 
executive late last year and was named tuesday as chairman of the 
executive committee another post the elder jovanovich is leaving 
analysts said they expect no major shifts in direction for the 
company which is grappling with how to handle a debt burden that 
is expected to become a more serious problem over the next few 
years as cash dividends come due 
i dont see where this makes a whole lot of difference said 
andrew herenstein who follows the company for the investment firm 
delaware bay co in new york there still has to be some kind of 
restructuring 
wall street also shrugged off the change in trading on the new 
york stock exchange harcourt finished unchanged at 312 a share 
william jovanovich joined harcourt brace amp co as a book 
salesman and editor in 1947 and built it into one of the nations 
leading publishers of textbooks as well a premier medical and 
professional publisher 
when he became president and chief executive in 1954 the 
company had annual sales of 8 million and employed 125 people 
last year it posted revenue of 13 billion and employed 6000 
people 
although he owned less than 2 percent of the companys stock 
jovanovich exercised unusually strong control over the company it 
added his name to its own in 1970 when jovanovich added chairman to 
his list of titles he was seen within the industry as a maverick 
moving the company to orlando fla from new york in 1983 and 
shunning the usual trade associations 
fortythree years is enough especially since i now can devote 
my time to editing books and writing them he said in announcing 
his resignation 
but jovanovich leaves the company with 16 billion in debt 
incurred in a 1987 recapitalization undertaken to avoid a takeover 
bid from british publisher robert maxwell 
many analysts say the company generates enough cash to meet its 
interest obligations over the next two years but they warn that 
trouble could develop in 1992 when cash payments start coming due 
on preferred stock and debt which now are issuing additional 
securities as dividends 
in an effort to pare its debt harcourt sold its theme park 
business to anheuserbusch cos for 11 billion last year but the 
price disappointed some analysts 
that sale helped the company post a profit of 721 million or 
17 cents a shsre in 1989 on revenue of 134 billion compared 
with a loss of 534 million or 203 a share on revenue of 127 
billion a year earlier 
more recently hbj was reported to have been in talks on selling 
more assets to thomson corp the canadian publisher the company 
never confirmed who it was talking with but announced may 9 that 
it had terminated talks on selling assets and public debt to a 
third party 
in addition to its publishing operations harcourt has interests 
in the insurance business which accounted for onethird of its 
1989 revenue 
herrington 51 has served as a member of the harcourt board 
since may 1989 and has served on its executive and finance 
committees 
he served as energy secretary in the reagan administration from 
february 1985 to january 1989 and was assistant secretary of the 
navy from 1981 to 1983 
herrington called jovanovich an american publishing legend a 
pioneer in educational technology and an industry giant who built 
the best independent publishing house in america 
in a telephone interview herrington said he became a candidate 
for the job after the elder jovanovich asked him to run for it i 
think its going to be a team effort between peter and i he 
said adding he brings management experience honed in overseeing 
the sprawling energy department to the job 
we are looking at all options we are interested in keeping 
this company viable independent and american he said

cents to 6579 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange 
on top of fridays 018 cent increase the july contract increased

major oil companies in the gulf coast market

line for routine maintenance would not return to full production as 
fast as originally expected 
gasoline outputs just a little behind where we thought it 
would be he said the refineries are coming back on but 
theyre coming back on a little more slowly than we anticipated 
among other refined products traded on the merc the june 
contract for home heating oil rose 058 cent a gallon to 5024 
cents after dropping 015 cent on friday later months showed 
slightly smaller increases 
bob baker senior energy analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc said the price rose on the coattails of the increase in 
unleaded gasoline 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil rose 18 cents to 1798 a 42gallon barrel 
on the mercantile exchange following a 3cent drop friday later 
contract months showed small increases

week that were spurred by renewed concerns of a worldwide oil glut 
natural gas prices declined the july contract fell to 1585 
per 1000 cubic feet from 1592 friday

a stockholder of adobe systems inc has 
sued the computer software company and its top officers over a 30 
percent plunge in its stock price claiming fraud and stock 
manipulation it was disclosed tuesday 
the us district court suit was filed friday after the price of 
adobes stock which is traded over the counter dropped by 1525 
a share to 3525 in reaction to the previous days report by the 
company that secondquarter earnings would be 27 to 35 cents a 
share far below previous projections 
adobe closed at 37875 a share tuesday in continued heavy 
selling 
stockholder donald a wells jr said in the suit that adobes 
top officers knew in march that the companys stock price was 
inflated but issued a series of misleadingly optimistic statements 
to the public 
wells cited a may 2 statement by john e warnock adobes 
chairman and president that the company would continue to 
demonstrate solid rates of growth and had maintained its leadership 
position in its industry adobes software is used to control 
computer printers 
warnock also stated that sales to apple computer inc adobes 
leading customer had not slowed despite knowing that apple 
planned to use a competitors product in its future laser printers 
and that sales to apple would plummet wells charges 
the suit said warnock and four other officers sold 316000 
shares of adobe stock between march 6 and last thursday at prices 
they knew were inflated meanwhile wells and other members of the 
public relied on the alleged misstatements by the company in buying 
the stock the suit said 
wells who said he and his retirement plan owned 500 shares of 
adobe seeks to sue on behalf of all who bought company stock 
during the period no specific amount of damages is claimed but 
the suit says the stocks aggregate value dropped by more than 300 
million during fridays selloff 
adobe based in mountain view issued a statement tuesday saying 
it was not unusual for companies having announced a drop in their 
income as we did to receive one or more similar complaints 
we also believe the lawsuit is completely without merit and we 
intend to vigorously contest the action the company said

a soviet health official said tuesday 
that consumers in his country are demanding safer food after the 
accident at the chernobyl nuclear power station 
in the last few years there has been a lot of discussion as to 
the information given to people as to what they eat drink and 
breathe and it has produced a lot of interest and activity in 
ecology alexander kondrusev vice minister of health said at a 
conference 
people do not want to eat the contaminated foods and they 
express it forcefully he said 
kondrusev and victor tutelyan an official with the soviet 
academy of medical scientists spoke at the opening of the 
international conference on food safety at michigan state 
university 
tutelyan said some meat milk and potatoes from a 
6200squaremile area near chernobyl are still contaminated with 
radiation he said 4 million people live in the area 
it will be a long time before it will be possible to obtain 
milk that meets current safety standards and is acceptable for 
use he said 
high radiation levels began showing up in soviet milk two or 
three days after the april 26 1986 explosion at the nuclear power 
station in chernobyl about 80 miles north of kiev 
two jetlike emissions of radioactive material spewed into the 
air followed for 10 days by a cloud of radioactive gases tutelyan 
said 
he said soviet officials attempted to protect the public by 
moving cattle into barns so that they would not graze in pastures 
contaminated by the fallout 
some citizens rejected the governments countermeasures nearly 
30 people mostly elderly farmers insisted on leaving their milk 
cows outdoors to graze on contaminated grass tutelyan said the 
farmers who were 70 or older decided not to worry about 
developing cancer in 20 years 
meat contaminated with radiation was buried in a 20mile zone 
around chernobyl but tutelyan said new technology has been 
developed to decontaminate meat 
he also said milk can be made into butter because the 
radioactive contaminants are concentrated in the water portion of 
the milk and can be separated in 1986 20 percent to 30 percent of 
milk meat greens and fruits produced near chernobyl had to be 
discarded he said

shearson lehman hutton inc continuing a major 
overhaul on tuesday named an executive from parent american 
express co to run the troubled firms retail brokerage and asset 
management units 
the move is the latest step by american express to reshape the 
nations secondlargest securities firm which has stumbled badly 
following a huge expansion in the 1980s 
shearson is expected in coming days to announce a reorganization 
that could split its investment banking business from its retail 
brokerage network possibly including the resurrection of the 
venerable lehman brothers name 
in what analysts called a precursor to the division 
shearsonsaid tuesday that jonathan s linen would become president 
and chief executive of the firms retail brokerage and assest 
management businesses starting next week 
linen 46 currently is president and chief executive of 
american express direct marketing and travelers checks group 
which includes investment products life insurance merchandising 
and publishing businesses 
linen was described as a close associate of american express 
chairman james d robinson iii who has led the restructuring at 
shearson 
shearson also said that hardwick simmons a respected industry 
figure who had run the firms brokerage division had resigned 
simmons former head of the securities industry association the 
industrys main trade group could not immediately be reached for 
comment 
american express in recent months has infused more than 1 
billion in capital into shearson and is buying all of the 
brokerages remaining common stock american express now holds 61 
percent of shearson 
robinson earlier this year installed howard l clark jr then 
american express chief financial officer as shearsons chairman 
and chief executive after ousting peter a cohen a wall street 
whiz who led shearsons growth 
the firm expanded in the last decade during a period of great 
deal making activity and unprecedented profits shearson in 1984 
took over the respected lehman brothers kuhn loeb inc investment 
bank in 1984 
shearson lost an industry record 915 million in the first 
quarter partly because of expenses to pay for a restructuring tht 
included about 2000 layoffs most wall street firms have been 
forced to cut back because of an industry slowdown since the 1987 
stock market crash 
linen has no direct experience in the securities business but 
is viewed as an effective troubleshooter during 21 years at 
american express he will be responsible for running shearsons 
retail network of about 10000 brokers second in number only to 
merrill lynch amp co 
shearsons retail network had about 180 billion of assets held 
in private accounts at the end of the first quarter and about 93 
billion under management for pension funds corporations and 
institutional clients 
analysts said they did not necessarily believe linens lack of 
experience on wall street would be a handicap they said his first 
task would be to renew confidence at the firm among its retail 
brokers 
linens marketing background also could help in assessing what 
financial products the firm is selling and their cost they said 
the primary focus right now is to get shearson straightened 
out said lawrence eckenfelder an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in san francisco some people say why bring in 
another person from the outside on the other hand the guys that 
had been running it hadnt been doing a very good job 
linen came to shearson in 1969 as assistant to the chairman who 
was then clarks father howard clark sr he held various 
positions including president of the us travel services division 
from 1980 to 1986

drexel burnham lambert inc on tuesday joined 
its parent company and filed for bankruptcy court protection 
saying it hoped to come back as an operating entity on wall street 
drexel said the filing under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
law was a step to enable the firm to emerge from court protection 
alive but it did not specify what kind of business it would 
operate 
as part of the plan drexel named john f sorte as chief 
executive he succeeded frederick h joseph who led the firm 
through its rapid rise in the 1980s under the growth of junk bonds 
pioneered by michael milken 
sorte 42 who will take over drexels daytoday operations 
was cohead of the firms corporate finance department and a member 
of its executive committee joseph will remain as president of the 
firms parent drexel burnham lambert group inc which sought 
bankruptcy protection feb 13 
previously it had been expected the drexel would simply 
liquidate all of its operations even though most of its 
subsidiaries were never covered by the parents bankruptcy filing 
in tuesdays filing made in us bankruptcy court in manhattan 
drexel said it is anticipated that a viable reorganized entity 
will emerge drexel said 14 other smaller subsidiaries of the 
parent company also filed for bankruptcy protection 
the company said the filing would allow the units to utilize 
and realize the full value of their respective assets 
the filing allows all of drexels operations to reorganize under 
court protection a move that would have been difficult had only 
the parent been in bankruptcy proceedings it also freezes 
outstanding litigation against any of the subsidiaries 
federal guidelines generally prohibit investment firms that do 
business with the public from seeking bankruptcy protection but 
drexel officials said the firm was able to make the filing because 
it no longer had any client accounts 
a revived drexel would not be expected to deal with the public 
but could seek to manage its existing stock and junk bond holdings 
and advise clients including companies that issued junk bonds 
under drexels auspices 
drexel said in a statement that it now has 500 employees down 
from 5400 when the parent filed for bankruptcy and more than 
10000 at its peak in the mid1980s 
in a court filing earlier this month drexel said it had total 
assets of 326 billion and liabilities of 28 billion as of april 
30 that was down from 54 billion at the time of the parents 
bankruptcy filing 
drexel said tuesday it has sold off 874 percent of its 
securities portfolio spokesman steven anreder said the firm still 
holds about 1 billion in securities mostly hardtosell junk 
bonds that have been battered by a downturn in that market since 
last fall 
drexel made millions in the 1980s in large part because of its 
prowess issuing risky highyield bonds used by expansionminded 
companies and for hostile takeovers 
but the firm last year pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed 
to pay 650 million to settle widespread securities law vioilations 
following a lengthy government investigation milken admitted to 
six felonies and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties last month

a recently formed pilots association at eastern 
airlines moved tuesday for an election that it hopes will make it 
the pilots bargaining agent replacing the union that struck the 
carrier last year 
the eastern pilots association said it represents 93 percent of 
the airlines 1775 flying pilots while the air line pilots 
association the current bargaining agent represents less than 5 
percent 
thomas cooper chairman of the epa steering committee said alpa 
has lost touch with easterns working pilots after leading them off 
the job in sympathy with striking machinists last year 
our organization better represents the real interests of the 
men and women who are flying easterns planes every day cooper 
said in a statement the fairest way for the pilots of eastern to 
determine the destiny of their own careers and the future of 
eastern is to have an election 
the epa is seeking immediate action on its application for an 
election to the national mediation board in washington 
alpa called off its walkout late last year but most of its 
members remain without jobs eastern is flying with pilots who 
crossed picket lines and with nonunion pilots who were hired 
during the strike 
alpas membership includes an estimated 1200 to 1400 eastern 
pilots who are not working 
under the railway labor act alpa is the legal bargaining 
agent for all eastern pilots and the actions taken today by the 
epa do not in any way affect that representation alpa spokesman 
lou baldwin said in a statement 
the airline had no comment an eastern spokesman said 
meanwhile eastern said tuesday it will offer special discount 
fares during june ranging from 49 to 99 each way for youngsters 
12 to 21 and people 62 and older 
the mileagebased fares are 49 one way for flights up to 300 
miles 69 for 3011200 miles and 99 for trips over 1200 miles 
rates are 10 more each way during peak travel times 
eastern said the fares are available in all domestic markets and 
good for travel beginning may 30 travel must be completed by june

the longdelayed seabrook plant lit up 
homes with nuclear power for the first time tuesday night as 
operators began gearing up toward full operation officials said 
the plant was operating at 15 percent capacity and producing 
about 75 megawatts of electricity enough to supply 65000 homes 
when it was connected to the new england power grid just after 8 
pm officials said 
the hookup occurred as part of a series of tests to ready the 
plant for full operation by midsummer spokesman ron sher said

toward making a major contribution to new englands longterm 
energy supplies edward brown president of plant operator new 
hampshire yankee said in the news release 
sher said the plant would produce electricity into the early 
morning hours and then be disconnected from the power grid so 
equipment can be tested operators will connect and disconnect the 
generator from the grid repeatedly during the next several weeks of 
testing 
at full power seabrook will generate 1150 megawatts enough to 
supply 1 million homes new hampshire yankee has said 
the plant first produced electricity during tests in november 
1985 before it received an operating license but that was 
nonnuclear power generated by the systems heater and pumps 
the 65 billion plant was licensed in march after years of 
delays opponents who claim the plant is unsafe and that the 
surrounding area cannot be evacuated in an emergency have fought 
the reactor in the courts through the regulatory process and in 
mass demonstrations since construction began in 1976 
the long delays and rising costs the original cost was 
projected at less than 1 billion forced its lead owner public 
service co of new hampshire into bankruptcy court in january
