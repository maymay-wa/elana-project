american and soviet negotiators completed a 
presummit agreement to expand commercial air travel between the 
two countries while working monday to expand an accord to cut 
longrange nuclear missiles 
the negotiators also were trying to revive slumping talks on 
reducing tanks and troops in europe 
a brief press notice at days end said simply they had met for 
2 hours and would continue the discussions on tuesday there was 
no word on the outcome 
the weekend talks at the state department were aimed at 
providing president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
with a solid basis for declaring a reversal in the ussoviet 
weapons competition at their summit meeting that opens in 
washington in three days 
four us cities and six soviet cities will be added to current 
airliner routes between the two countries under an agreement 
reached sunday and to be signed at the summit 
us officials said monday that the agreement could quadruple 
air travel between the two countries and for the first time 
provide regular cargo service it will allow six additional us 
airlines to operate as well as a new soviet airline to participate 
in service between the two nations 
only pan am and the soviet airline aeroflot now fly ussoviet 
routes serving new york washington moscow and leningrad 
additional us cities to be provided service under the new 
agreement are anchorage alaska chicago san francisco and miami 
the new soviet cities are kiev minsk magadan khabarovsk tbilisi 
and riga in latvia 
in addition the two sides agreed to allow at least 100 annual 
charter flights over the north atlantic route and to consider up to 
100 charters across the pacific 
us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
final details involved a compromise on the percentage of rubles 
paid by soviet travelers that moscow will guarantee to convert into 
us dollars 
the united states originally insisted on 15 percent while the 
soviets only wanted to guarantee to 65 per cent negotiators 
settled on a compromise that 875 percent of the space on us 
airliners flying out of the soviet union would be purchased with 
rubles convertible to dollars 
a number of us carriers have expressed interest in competing 
with pan am for the expanded service including delta united 
alaska air and northwest 
the two countries arms control negotiating teams met in three 
sessions sunday totaling 6 hours while the soviets awaited 
further instructions from moscow the us delegation headed by 
under secretary reginald bartholomew met separately monday 
the soviet delegation led by deputy prime minister viktor p 
karpov an experienced arms control negotiator initially was sent 
here to take up a halfdozen unsettled strategic weapons reduction 
issues 
but a us official declining to be identified said the talks 
also were dealing with cuts in us and soviet troops tanks 
artillery and airplanes in europe there was no word from officials 
on either side on the results 
a threesentence notice to the press sunday night said the 
delegations had met from 11 am to 130 pm resumed at 330 pm 
for two hours and met a third time from 730 pm until 930 pm 
meanwhile in another sign of ussoviet cooperation us 
officials said on monday the soviets had recently informed the bush 
administration that they would begin dismantling the krasnoyarsk 
radar facility in eastern siberia 
we recently saw signs that this is going on said one of the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the reagan administration in two reports to congress said the 
installation violated the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which 
imposes strict limits on radar 
after protesting initially the soviets eventually relented and 
said they would correct the infraction by dismantling the facility 
the treaty limits us and soviet antimissile defenses on the 
theory a potential aggressor would hesitate to launch a first 
strike rather than face devastating retaliation 
bush and gorbachev are due to make a declaration at the summit 
that us and soviet longrange missiles bombers and submarines 
will be reduced as part of a treaty scheduled for completion by the 
end of the year 
the holiday weekend talks were designed to expand the 
declaration to cover weapons still in dispute and to determine how 
to verify compliance with the pact 
among the issues are whether restrictions are to be imposed on 
soviet backfire bomber and whether to bar the soviets from 
modernizing their ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles 
under the proposed treaty the soviets would cut their arsenal of 
the heavy groundbased missiles from 308 to 154 however secretary 
of state james a baker iii tentatively agreed in talks may 1619 
in moscow to permit some new flight tests and limited production of 
replacement missiles under the numerical ceiling 
the trip by baker involved concessions on both sides while 
settling longstanding disputes over airlaunched and sealaunched 
cruise missiles 
last friday gorbachev warned at a news conference in moscow 
that he might review his arms control policies if the united states 
and its allies insist that a unified germany belong to the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
us officials demanding anonymity said gorbachev gave a 
similar warning privately to baker to explain a slowdown in 
negotiations over another treaty to cut us and soviet troops 
and tanks in europe 
however gorbachev sent the delegation headed by karpov here in 
an apparent effort to maintain the momentum of bakers talks in 
moscow 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said friday 
he had been told by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
that the soviets were keen on concluding these negotiations 
soon 
the soviets are apprehensive about a stronger germany 
especially since their allies in the warsaw pact have been showing 
signs of easing away from the soviet orbit

breaking a long silence former boston mayor kevin 
white said an aborted 1981 birthday party for his wife was designed 
to raise funds to supplement his salary 
the party was ostensibly organized to honor whites wife 
kathyrn but white said sunday during a television interview it 
was an idea artificially hatched to make up for a problem the 
problem was i could barely survive on my salary 
the exmayor said the establishment of the party fund was not 
improper but when the process appeared to be abused and it 
was wrong he called it off 
white a democrat angrily denied charges of corruption at the 
time but they played an important role in his decision not to run 
for reelection in 1981 he had served 16 years as mayor 
the party was investigated by the states ethics commission and 
the us attorneys office white was censured but not fined 
whites statements on whdhtvs boston common program 
contradicted the testimony by carolyn galvin connors mrs whites 
sister who said the idea for the birthday party came from their 
mother 
connors eventually received more than 100000 checks from 
people she did not invite the boston globe reported monday 
theodore v anzalone the former mayors chief fundraiser was 
charged in connection with a moneylaundering scheme which 
prosecutors claim was linked to the party anzalones conviction 
for currency law violations was later overturned 
white said sunday he was making 40000 a year as mayor i was 
living on 40000 a year for 10 years with no raise he said 
he said being mayor was my life so this was an artificial way 
in which some kind of fund probably could be established 
whites salary was increased by 25000 to 65000 less than 
four months before the date scheduled for the april 1981 party

a schism developed in new yorks troubled 
republican party on the eve of todays convention to nominate a 
challenger to democratic gov mario cuomo 
only last week did gop leaders find a candidate in littleknown 
economist pierre rinfret then on monday conservative republican 
herbert london handed the party a new problem by refusing to be 
rinfrets running mate 
instead the new york university professor said he hoped to run 
for governor as the candidate of the states tiny but influential 
conservative party 
i think this is a year for a crusade this is a year to attack 
both the republican and the democratic parties london said 
normally republicans and conservatives agree on a ticket a 
split would make it easier for cuomo to win his expected 
reelection bid for a third fouryear term 
michael long state chairman of the conservative party welcomed 
london im tickled pink he said this is not going to be a 
campaign but a crusade for the middle class the working taxpayer 
to retake new york 
londons decision came one day before the start of the 
republicans threeday convention in this community north of new 
york city 
cuomo is considered a potential 1992 presidential contender if 
hes not upset in his bid for reelection democrats meet next week 
to nominate him 
the governors advisers have taken delight in the republicans 
problems in finding someone to challenge cuomo 
theyve made it so clear that theyre reaching to the bottom 
of the barrel said andrew cuomo the governors son and chief 
political adviser why should anyone give them credibility 
london admitted he has little chance of winning but said his 
candidacy is a way of putting the republican party on notice 
he has maintained that his conservative views including his 
antiabortion stance are unacceptable to the state gop leadership 
rinfret is reported to be prochoice as is cuomo rinfret has 
refused interviews 
everyone has to do what they have to do elizabeth deltorto 
a spokeswoman for state gop chairman j patrick barrett said of 
londons move 
rinfret 66 heads an economics consulting firm and has never 
run for office he was an unpaid adviser to presidents kennedy 
johnson and nixon 
london 51 ran a brief and littlenoticed campaign for the gop 
nomination for mayor of new york last year 
barrett said a major factor in his support for rinfret is his 
willingness to spend his own money on the race up to 500000 by 
one report and his ability to raise money on wall street

a year after the massacre that left their friends 
dead and bloodied on tiananmen square the fervor of last june has 
faded and many chinese students in the united states have put away 
their protest signs and reopened their books 
chinese students here still push for democratic reforms but 
many are split over what road the movement should take and some 
former activists even suggest their counterparts in china pushed 
the government too far and are partly responsible for the infamous 
crackdown 
xu chenggang 38 a graduate student in economics at harvard 
university watched the televised images of the tanks rolling into 
the gates of heavenly peace as the square is called in chinese 
he saw his friends maimed and killed like many others he was 
roused to action 
in that time in my mind the most important thing was to stop 
the killings so i got very active and emotional xu said for 
two months i went to rallies and meetings 
then came a change of heart xu returned to his studies 
i realized it was impossible to overthrow the government he 
said i think i thought it would be better to view this as a long 
historical movement 
the 7weekold democracy movement was crushed the night of june 
34 when the chinese government ordered troops to capture tiananmen 
square hundreds perhaps thousands were killed in the ensuing 
chaos 
xu admires the courage and persistence of the students in the 
democracy movement he thinks however their influence is limited 
and he lays part of the blame for the deaths at their feet 
they were too uncompromising they were not organized and they 
pushed the government too far xu said the fault is the 
governments but the students should have foreseen what would 
happen 
pei minxin 32 a doctoral student in political science at 
harvard who remains politically active said perhaps 80 percent of 
the 40000 chinese students in the united states took part in 
protests against their government after the tiananmen massacre 
now he admits that number has dropped by at least half 
they have to be students first not activists first pei 
said chinese students work in labs they teach and all that 
takes away time from activism 
but while the democracy movement has lost steam it has not 
stopped 
student dissidents who escaped china after tiananmen continue 
their work prominent activist wuer kaixi for instance has moved 
from the boston area to paris where he works with a prodemocracy 
organization pei said 
some protest groups begun last spring have become going concerns 
with its phone bank fax machine and computers the studentrun 
china information center in newton mass served as the main 
communications link between protesters in this country and in 
tiananmen during the uprising 
now the centers staff is busy creating an archive with 
artifacts and video footage from chinas democracy movement as 
well as a computer database for student activists in this country 
last fall the center incorporated 
people still think demonstrations are the only way to go 
forward we dont believe that said liu yuan its president 
we want to open a debate we think this is what we can do 
in chicago students produce a halfhour radio show each day 
with news otherwise censored by the chinese government the show is 
broadcast from stations near china and reaches up to 70 percent of 
the country said li sanyuan ones of the shows founders 
the broadcast gets its news from us newspapers and from 
sources inside china a typical show recently carried a report of a 
factory strike in the city of chongqing in southcentral china 
the government wants to tell people all the good things but 
they might not be true li said in certain places people 
dont have food anymore that information could trigger 
prodemocracy movement 
a prodemocracy newspaper set up by chinese journalists and 
students in los angeles has a circulation of 30000 and is 
published every 10 days it is distributed in china and several 
western nations 
we get into china three ways fax mail and smuggling said 
editorinchief ben tang we are in at least 20 major cities 
there 
many students however continue to be frightened to speak up 
both because they want to return home someday and because they fear 
reprisals against loved ones in china pei said 
the students fears were heightened recently by reports from a 
chinese bureaucrat who defected to the united states he said the 
communist party planned to send officials to us college campuses 
to court sympathetic students and intimidate the chinese activists 
they saw what happened in china they know politics is a risky 
business pei said we lost quite a large number of people 
especially after the new revelations 
pei said students no longer believe change will take china by 
storm as it has eastern europe so their concerns are less urgent 
than last spring and their goals have become longterm 
key issues now are economic sanctions against china and whether 
the country will continue to enjoy favorable trading status with 
the united states he said 
here there is disagreement some students said they support 
strong economic sanctions against china for the crackdown xu 
however said sanctions would hurt fledgling entrepreneurs and 
joint business ventures with the west 
joint ventures are really good things xu said removing 
those things would remove the seeds of the revolution 
pei said student emotions have cooled a little bit since last 
june some people say tough sanctions others say less people 
differ on how the movement should proceed 
the students do agree that the long march toward democracy in 
china began in earnest last june 4 
before last spring democracy as a goal was illegitimate 
pei said now its been branded by blood into the national 
consciousness 
the gains made they also note sadly came at a high price both 
for the students who stood in the square that night and those who 
stood with them from afar 
im one of the socalled extreme counterrevolutionaries 
said pei whose parents sisters and brother are back home in 
shanghai it would be suicidal to go back

the partys over for some 1000 passengers on 
a luxury liner that ran aground in the delaware bay 
the cheering passengers arrived on land by ferry monday night 
their luxury cruise nearly two days late and 100 miles short of its 
destination 
it wasnt a bad party said a female passenger who was met 
by friends and family at dockside 
the ferry delaware brought the passengers from the stranded 
642foot regent star to shore at 1017 pm the luxury liner was 
originally scheduled to dock in philadelphia at 8 am sunday 
the cheering subsided quickly when officials informed the 
passengers that transferring them to buses would take another two 
or three hours 
dorothy klausmeyer and mary poniaoski of baltimore were able to 
leave quickly because friends and family met them 
they said the adventure was a bit frightening at first but said 
passengers quickly adjusted with help from free food and drink 
other passengers were not immediately available to a group of 
waiting reporters because buses drove onto the ferry and boarded 
people while on the ship 
buses were standing by to take passengers back to their cars 
which were at airports and bus stations in washington dc 
philadelphia and the new york city area 
the ship got stuck on the sand bar early sunday after a small 
fire knocked out power it was carrying 1360 people about 300 of 
whom were crew members 
nobody was in danger during the two days atop the sand bar said 
coast guard spokesman lt james weakley 
ann burguieres a spokeswoman for regency cruises said ship 
officials had described the mood on board as jovial with free food 
and drinks being served 
its more of an inconvenience factor she said theyre 
always well stocked there is always plenty of food and drink on a 
cruise 
coast guard spokesman dave oney confirmed the ship had plenty 
of food and water and also party conveniences 
when the lights went out in the disco passenger kathleen 
hopkins said everybody was singing hot hot hot and later 
sang christmas carols and played an improvised version of the 
newlywed game 
people started chanting drinks drinks drinks and free 
mimosas started flowing hopkins said 
another passenger barbara sowden of wilmington del said by 
phone it just gave us a great opportunity to party hardy a 
little longer we dont need a band we make our own music 
the regent star sitting a mile off fortescue nj had been in 
the final leg of a sevenday cruise from montego bay jamaica when 
it ran aground 
the ferry delaware which normally runs between lewes del and 
cape may nj was pressed into service during the busy memorial 
day weekend when the coast guard determined that pushing the regent 
star off the sand bar would increase the risk of a fuel spill 
oney said the ships anchor was believed to be under the hull 
and could puncture the fuel tanks the ship carried 30000 gallons 
of diesel fuel and 240000 gallons of fuel oil he said none had 
leaked as of monday evening 
the fuel would have to be transferred to higher tanks before 
another effort could be made to free the ship oney said 
tugboats had tried to move the liner sunday but failed 
it was the ships first trip up the delaware bay the regent 
star usually stays in the carribbean burguieres said but was 
brought north for a series of summer cruises between new york and 
montreal

soviet troops sent to armenia to quell ethnic 
unrest killed at least 20 people in gun battles with armenian 
nationalists in and around the republics capital an interior 
ministry spokesman said today 
the violence exploded in yerevan as additional interior ministry 
troops arrived in the city 
a mass rally was scheduled for today by the armenian national 
movement to commemorate armenias 1918 declaration of independence 
said satenik paramadjan a spokesman for the movement armenia was 
annexed by the soviet union in 1920 
the armenian government and the republics communist party 
declared tuesday a day of mourning radio yerevan said in a report 
monitored by the british broadcasting corp in london 
rafael popyan a leader of the armenian national movement said 
there were several clashes in yerevan and its outskirts late sunday 
and this morning 
soviet soldiers just came into the city shooting he said 
the first clash occurred sunday when soviet troops returning 
from a patrol were fired upon by armenian militants at yerevans 
main railroad station said soviet interior ministry spokesman yuri 
makarov 
the soldiers returned the gunfire killing five of the 
attackers makarov said a sixth militant died later at a hospital 
makarov said 20 soviet soldiers were wounded in the shootout 
the official tass news agency said one civilian bystander was also 
hospitalized with bullet wounds 
an armenian national movement spokesman disputed the official 
version of the clash saying the soviet soldiers had started it by 
opening fire on a group of armenians 
after the railway station shootout unrest continued throughout 
the day in yerevan as crowds in the thousands roamed the streets 
according to a duty officer at the armenian national movement 
headquarters in yerevan contacted by telephone 
the bloodiest clash occurred as a convoy of 15 armored personnel 
carriers headed toward the city center from a nearby base popyan 
said he said soviet troops opened fire on a crowd of people who 
attempted to block the road the convoy was traveling on with a 
barricade of parked cars 
according to a preliminary report 14 civilian gunmen were 
killed and more than 30 injued in the clash at the barricade 
makarov said 
a busload of soviet soldiers also fired on the headquarters of 
the armenian national movement early this morning killing a person 
sleeping in a car outside members of the movement said in a 
telephone interview 
no one inside was injured but an activist who was sleeping in 
his parked car was shot dead paramadjan said 
there was no immediate confirmation of the death from soviet 
authorities 
the clashes were the latest outbreak of violence in the tense 
caucasus republic but the incidents marked the first time the 
clashes spread to a public place in yerevan 
tass said the railway station shootout began after the soldiers 
were attacked by about 15 armed men as they were returning from 
escorting a passenger train to kafan 120 miles southeast of 
yerevan 
the southeastern corner of armenia near kafan has become one of 
the tensest areas in the dispute between armenians and azerbaijanis 
over control of the nagornokarabakh region 
armenia has been locked in a bitter dispute for more than two 
years with azerbaijan over control of nagornokarabakh that region 
is predominantly ethnic armenian but legally belongs to azerbaijan 
several hundred people have been killed and hundreds of 
thousands forced to flee their homes in more than two years of 
ethnic attacks and clashes involving civilians and soldiers 
soviet soldiers are stationed in both republics to quell 
violence but militants on both sides see the troops as an 
occupying force 
sundays violence came three days after militants fired on 
soldiers at military checkpoints and on a patrol in 
nagornokarabakh killing one serviceman and wounding four tass 
said soldiers killed one attacker and wounded six in the incidents 
on friday the general commanding the interior ministry troops 
told tass that he was trying to end the strife in armenia by 
political means 
but col gen yuri shatalin warned the interior ministry 
troops were ready to carry out the responsible task of disarming 
armed detachments in the republic

populist boris n yeltsin renewed his bid for the 
presidency of the russian republic today and offered to create a 
coalition government with his conservative opponents 
yeltsin speaking to the 1060member russian congress which 
will choose the republics president invited members of the 
communist party bloc and others to work out a deal that would 
please the majority of russian deputies 
russia the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
stretches from the baltic to the pacific and includes moscow and 
many major cities its language predominates in the soviet union 
and it contains much of the soviet unions wealth of natural 
resources 
yeltsin also called on the congress to reject the central soviet 
governments program for a transition to a partial market economy 
which was announced last week 
the congress must take the citizens of russia under its 
defense he said 
the plan which will double food prices has set off widespread 
panic buying and soviet president mikhail gorbachev went on 
television sunday night to try to calm fears 
gorbachev who opposes yeltsins plan to give the republic more 
autonomy has urged the russian congress not to elect yeltsin 
yeltsins main rival is krasnodar regional communist party chief 
ivan polozkov neither received the required majority of 531 votes 
in rounds of voting on friday and saturday 
polozkov was among the nominees again today as was russian 
premier alexander vlasov who had dropped out during last weeks 
nominations 
some lawmakers said yeltsins coalition offer might give him the 
votes he needed to win election 
discontent over the central soviet governments economic program 
also boosted yeltsins chances said one of his backers lawmaker 
leonid gurevich of murmansk 
i think he has even more support because during the break on 
sunday many deputies had a chance to talk to their voters and saw 
the greater tension resulting from price rises and empty stores 
said gurevich 
some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people 
could lose their jobs as a result of the reforms expected to drive 
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy 
under the threestep reform plan to be implemented through 
1995 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public 
sector and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices other 
prices would remain under state control

a stillunexplained problem has 
developed with a computerized display unit in space shuttle 
columbia but it is not expected to delay this weeks launch a 
nasa official said today 
technicians replaced the socalled headsup display which 
projects data used by the shuttles commander during landing on 
sunday night but that did not fix the problem nasa tried to 
determine today what was wrong with the display units related 
equipment 
thats really our only real problem everything else is going 
very smoothly nasa test director al sofge said at a morning 
briefing 
columbia is scheduled to lift off at 1238 am edt wednesday 
after the unit was removed it tested normally and the 
replacement unit was not working prompting nasa officials to 
suspect a related piece of equipment the display units 
electronics package sofge said 
sofge said officials should know by midday whether the problem 
indeed lies with that electronics package if necessary 
technicians will replace the device about the size of a 
videocassette recorder and located in the middeck 
it will take about eight hours to replace the electronics 
package and another eight hours to test it sofge said that work 
can be performed while other countdown procedures continue he said 
there is a very remote possibility the problem could lie 
with yet another part the display units power control assembly 
but even that wouldnt necessarily delay the launch sofge said 
if it turns out that it is the pca we still think we can go 
ahead and change that out and make the launch date he said 
the mission already has been delayed two weeks because of 
repairs to the shuttles cooling system at the launch pad 
columbias seven astronauts meanwhile say they are eager to 
get started on a mission to explore highenergy ultraviolet light 
and xrays emitted from stars and galaxies 
everythings big on this mission columbia commander vance 
brand said sunday we have a big crew we have a lot of days on 
orbit nine or 10 and we think a lot of good and important things 
to do 
the crew the biggest since the 1986 challenger explosion 
arrived late sunday morning in five trainer jets from johnson space 
center in houston the countdown began as planned at 1 am sunday 
we know we have a great ship and were ready to go brand 
said 
air force forecasters were predicting an 80 percent chance of 
favorable weather at launch time 
columbia will be carrying a 150 million observatory called 
astro that will be operated roundtheclock by four crew members 
who are astronomers astros three ultraviolet telescopes and one 
xray telescope will scan space from columbias payload bay as the 
shuttle orbits 218 miles above earth 
because of the flights duration five sets of fuel storage 
tanks will be used instead of the customary three to provide power 
to the orbiting shuttle leinbach said 
the national aeronautics and space administration loaded the 
onboard tanks with liquid oxygen and hydrogen this morning 
technicians on sunday finished restocking the xray telescope 
with argon needed to keep its heatsensitive instruments cold 
columbia has six days in which to lift off after which the flight 
will be delayed a week so more argon can be added 
it will be the first mission since 1985 to use components of 
spacelab a research facility designed for orbiting shuttles 
crewmen will use spacelab computers in the rear flight deck to 
operate astro anchored in the payload bay 
no spacewalks are planned although astronauts mike lounge and 
jeffrey hoffman are prepared to venture outside the cabin if one of 
the telescopes needs repairs or readjustment 
astro will probe ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from 
stars the comet austin and other matter in space little is known 
about those kinds of radiation because the wavelengths cannot 
penetrate the atmosphere and thus cannot be studied from the ground

masked gunmen shot and killed two 
australian tourists traveling in a britishregistered car in what 
appeared to be a case of mistaken identity by the irish republican 
army authorities said today 
the attack sunday apparently was targeted at british military 
personnel based in nearby west germany but the victims had no 
military connections said alan patterson a spokesman for the 
british army on the rhine 
the two men the wife of one and girlfriend of the other had 
just dined at a nearby italian restaurant when three masked gunmen 
sped up in their car and attacked with automatic weapons said 
roermond police chief j kuijpers 
one of the slain men was standing outside the tourists car and 
the other was sitting inside it with the women who escaped injury 
police said 
in canberra australia the department of foreign affairs 
identified the men as nick spanos of sydney and stephen melrose of 
brisbane both 24 the women were identified as melroses wife 
lyndal and spanos girlfriend vicky coss 
this has all the hallmarks of an ira attack britains armed 
forces minister archie hamilton said in a statement released in 
london today 
my deepest sympathy is with the families of those who have 
been killed in this despicable act upon defenseless people this is 
typical of the iras total lack of regard for human life 
national police spokesman louis steens also said the style and 
location of the assault pointed to ira gunmen who have carried out 
other attacks on british troops in the area frequented by british 
soldiers stationed at bases in nearby west germany a 10 to 
15minute drive away 
weve had it confirmed by the dutch police that the victims 
were not british service personnel but may have become targets 
because of their britishregistered car patterson said from 
british army headquarters in moenchengladbach west germany 
australian embassy spokesman john monfries said the two couples 
were just driving through roermond perhaps on a weekend trip 
the shooting ccurred in the citys historic market square 
police immediately alerted all crossing points on the relatively 
open west german and belgian borders steens said

president saddam hussein warned israel 
today that iraq will use weapons of total destruction against 
the jewish state if it attacks iraq with similar weapons 
saddam spoke at the opening session of an emergency arab league 
summit to muster support for what he says is a western and israeli 
campaign against his country the summit will also seek ways to 
stem the largescale emigration of soviet jews to israel 
we declare that if israel commits aggression and attacks then 
we will hit back strongly saddam said 
if israel uses weapons of total destruction then we will use 
weapons of total destruction against it and we will never give up 
palestine he said 
he did not specify what weapons he was talking about but the 
arabs claim the israelis have up to 200 nuclear weapons iraq has 
been building an arsenal of longrange missiles capable of hitting 
israel 
saddam has said baghdad has stocks of binary chemical weapons 
and in march he threatened to use them against the jewish state if 
attacked 
today he accused the united states of financing and encouraging 
israeli aggression and expansionism 
the united states bears a basic and primary responsibility for 
the policy practiced by the zionist entity against the arabs 
he said speaking in baghdads ornate conference center 
king hussein of jordan one of saddams closest allies appealed 
to arab leaders to help his hashemite kingdom revive its wavering 
economy and buttress its military power 
the arab league meeting comes days before the summit in 
washington between president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the arab leaders were expected to draft a letter to 
the superpower leaders 
conference sources said arab foreign ministers appeared in 
agreement that the letter should urge gorbachev to block the 
expected emigration of as many as 750000 soviet jews to israel 
over the next few years 
the arabs fear many soviet jews will settle in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip which the palestinians 
proclaimed their homeland in 1988 jordan which neighbors the west 
bank is concerned largescale jewish settlement in the region will 
drive palestinians into jordan and destabilize the kingdom 
the summit was intended to be a show of arab unity but 
divisions and rivalries were apparent 
there was disagreement between the hardliners led by saddam and 
the moderates including egypt and saudi arabia over how tough a 
line they should take against the united states 
the conference was boycotted by syrian president hafez assad 
saddams archrival in the arab world and by president elias hrawi 
of lebanon syrian troops control twothirds of hrawis wartorn 
country 
morocco algeria and oman were represented by senior government 
officials 
assad said he would not attend the summit held in the capital of 
his arab rival because it was too hastily convened without a proper 
agenda addressing the myriad problems facing the arab world 
the opening of the summit was delayed by an abortive lastminute 
attempt by libyan leader col moammar gadhafi to persuade assad to 
attend the conference in the name of arab unity 
gadhafi arrived in baghdad on a flight from damascus the syrian 
capital at midday today without assad or any other syrian 
representative libyan diplomats reported 
syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the arab socialist 
baath party assad has stonewalled arab bids to end his 11yearold 
feud with saddam a major obstacle to arab efforts to forge a new 
unity 
contrary to tradition the opening statements by the 15 kings 
sheiks and presidents attending the conference were not broadcast 
a 16page us state department memorandum delivered to the 21 
arab league foreign ministers last week touched off an uproar by 
urging the leaders to avoid excessively ardent language focus 
on direct arabisraeli peace talks and avoid denunciations of 
soviet jewish emigration 
the memorandum also accused iraq of violating international 
conventions banning the use of chemical and biological weapons 
in jerusalem israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs aide avi 
pazner quoted shamir sunday as saying he hoped the summit would 
not pour fuel on to the fire but to the contrary will also 
contribute to improving the atmosphere maybe by agreeing to 
negotiations with israel

burmas military government conceded today 
that the leading opposition party appeared headed for victory in a 
nationwide election and promised to relinquish power once a new 
constitution was approved 
but observers have said that process could take years and one 
government official indicated the military government might 
restrict the actions of the new parliament 
officials at the national league for democracy headquarters said 
unofficial returns from sundays election showed they won 230 of 
the 485 seats in the national legislature the vote was the first 
multiparty election in 30 years 
in an earlier statement col ye htut a spokesman for the 
military junta told reporters that unofficial returns showed the 
league carrying 100 of the 485 constituencies by a twothirds 
majority 
the latest official tally announced by state radio said the 
league had won 18 constituencies while the promilitary national 
united party had yet to win any two smaller prodemocracy parties 
each won one constituency 
final results will take up to three weeks to compile 
the military rulers called sundays elections but banned the 
leagues two top officials from participating one is under house 
arrest the other in jail the party says hundreds of other members 
are also imprisoned 
diplomats and other analysts have said the governments main 
goal in holding the elections is to attract foreign investment to 
the impoverished country and to obtain foreign aid 
most foreign aid to burma was suspended to protest the bloody 
1988 military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement that left 
thousands dead 
western diplomats contacted in rangoon said reaction to the 
early election results was tempered with caution 
there is euphoria in the party but it is not so evident in the 
streets one diplomat said on condition of anonymity burmese 
have had too many shocks in the past few years and they are waiting 
to see what is the final result i think 
prior to the voting critics pointed to arrests intimidation 
and detentions of major opposition figures and expressed skepticism 
about the prospects for a fair election 
but there was relatively little violence on election day 
the working peoples daily said 15 people were hurt in a grenade 
attack sunday in thanbyuzayat 80 miles southeast of rangoon it 
blamed the attack on unscrupulous destructive elements 
attempting to disrupt the elections 
some dissidents from burmas many ethnic minority groups 
fighting the central government had called off earlier plans to 
disrupt the polls 
ye htut said the military rulers would step aside after 
lawmakers draft and enact a new constitution and a new government 
is elected under that documents laws 
the army will abide by the new constitution he told 
reporters 
it is totally up to the elected members of the new 
legislature they can move as quickly as they like and take 
power said another military spokesman kyaw sann 
however deputy foreign minister ohn gyaw told reporters the 
military council may establish temporary ground rules for the 
parliament he declined to elaborate 
victory celebrations by prodemocracy forces were reported in 
several large cities 
officials of the national league for democracy expressed hopes 
for the release of their leaders barred from participation in the 
elections aung san suu kyi the popular daughter of independence 
hero aung san is under house arrest and tin oo is in jail 
it is an excellent day for burma we are making a new history 
i hope said bahan a executive committee member of the league 
we had expected a win but not so much of a landslide as this 
we hope with this mandate by the people we can go on to change 
to a democratic system very easily and peacefully he said 
myint u another league official said the party wanted to 
temporarily adopt the constitution burma had after its independence 
from britain in 1948 from then until a military coup in 1962 
burma had been a democratic multiparty state 
sundays election contested by 93 political groups and 2297 
candidates was to fill the national legislature which is to draft 
the new constitution

president bush said today he will 
welcome soviet president mikhail s gorbachev with open arms to 
this weeks summit but he promised to stand firm on americas 
principles about how to keep europe stable and the world at peace 
the president reviewed a colorful ragtag parade of fire 
engines school bands and a veterans brigade through dock square 
in this seaside resort where he has spent nearly every summer of 
his life eight veterans fired a 24gun salute and two buglers 
from kennebunk high school played taps 
bush basking in the sunshine and surrounded by his wife 
children and grandchildren called it a little piece of 
americana and said he was going home this afternoon to prepare 
for the summit refurbished by this beautiful four days right here 
in our beloved kennebunkport 
looking to thursdays opening meeting with gorbachev bush said 
theres no question that we have a better chance now for a 
lasting world peace but theres still some enormous problems out 
there and this country must remain strong we must remain 
committed to the values that have made us great over the last 
200plus years 
i go to the summit with open arms to welcome the president of 
the soviet union but we must stand for our principles when we 
discuss world peace we must stand on our principles when we 
discuss the stability in europe or the future of the countries 
around the world that yet are not free he said thats exactly 
what i plan to do 
earlier bush told reporters he believes gorbachev is pretty 
darn strong despite the widening economic crisis in the soviet 
union 
bush before teeing off for a final round of golf on his 
fourday weekend vacation said he has enormous problems but 
its not our business to sort out the other persons economic 
problems weve got some of our own 
asked about the possibility of gorbachevs being overthrown 
bush said i dont think thats my business to sort that out i 
deal with the soviet leader thats there in place coming to the 
united states to discuss these matters 
this man has survived ive given him i think appropriate 
credit for the dramatic changes in eastern europe bush said 
my own personal opinion is that hes pretty darn strong 
there the president added 
gorbachev went on soviet television sunday night to appeal to 
his countrymen for calm in the face of panic buying triggered by 
moscows plans to double the prices of food and other goods 
asked if he was ready for the summit bush leaning against a 
golf club smiled and said ive got some more work to do but 
im been reading my briefing books 
bush said he was almost through the first one and ill get 
the second one done tonight and then well have two days of 
intensive consultation to bring us up to date on where we go but i 
think i know the issues 
bush said he wasnt expecting any surprises form gorbachev and 
had none of his own to bring to the table 
on a separate matter the president was asked if he thought 
sailor clayton hartwig was owed an apology by the navy which has 
reopened its investigation into the explosion last year aboard the 
uss iowa that killed 47 seamen the initial navy report said 
hartwig who was killed in the explosion probably triggered it 
intentionally because he was upset over the breakup of a friendship 
with another sailor 
if the man is proved innocent of these allegations clearly 
there should be a statement to that effect but i cant judge it 
said bush 
bush was flying back to washington in midafternoon with his 
wife barbara and their weekend house guest transportation 
secretary samuel skinner and his wife honey skinner also was in 
bushs earlymorning foursome as they got in their last 18 holes at 
the cape arundel golf club with local pro ken raynor and bush 
friend spike heminway 
bush teed off last after the three others hit long drives the 
president predicted his own swing would be like a fine 
bordeaux but then topped the ball and hit it only 30 yards he 
took a second swing and lofted that ball far down the fairway 
bush and gorbachev are to sign an agreement friday to destroy 
chemical weapons and outline limits on cruise missiles which have 
been an obstacle to agreement on a strategic nuclear weapons pact 
us and soviet negotiators met in washington on sunday to try to 
expand the agreement 
bush acknowledged that gorbachev may be mad with me over some 
things but he called the soviet leader the kind of man you can 
talk very frankly with i want to narrow the differences 
bush said soviet pressure against the breakaway republic of 
lithuania is an issue that is troubling that i dont want to 
sweep under this rug 
bush was interviewed thursday by soviet television journalist 
valentin zorin 
if we argue well do that pleasantly hes a tough guy 
bush said listen ive been around him enough to know that he 
drives his point home well i can do the same thing

youve heard it all before to live long eat 
right sounds simple but the experts all seemed to have different 
ideas about what was right 
after holding what amounted to a food summit last year 10 
health agencies five private and five public have now come up 
with a list of jointly recommended dietary guidelines 
they call it the healthy american diet with six general 
diet principles for everyone over the age of 2 
eat a nutritionally adequate diet consisting of a variety of 
foods 
reduce consumption of fat especially saturated fat and 
cholesterol 
achieve and maintain a reasonable body weight 
increase consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber 
reduce intake of sodium 
consume alcohol in moderation if at all children adolescents 
and pregnant women should abstain 
the health organizations ranging from the american academy of 
pediatrics to the u s department of agriculture also recommended 
that some segments of the population mostly women and the young 
take additional measures 
to avoid dental cavities especially for children the groups 
recommended fluoride in drinking water and limited betweenmeal 
snacks containing sugar adolescents and young women should eat 
more highcalcium foods such as lowfat dairy products 
children adolescents and women of childbearing age also should 
include ironrich foods such as red meat fish and cereals in 
their diets in order to avoid anemia 
many of the groups such as the american heart association 
already had recommended diets but the experts diets often 
differed slightly from organization to organization dr alan chait 
of the university of washington in seattle thought it was possible 
people didnt know which to follow 
chait who also is chairman of the heart associations nutrition 
committee said a common message on diet recommendations should 
go a long way to reduce confusion among the public 
the groups joint report said nutritional deficiencies such as 
not enough vitamins used to be the nations top dietary problem 
now it is eating too much food of the wrong kind variety and 
moderation the groups said is the key to healthy eating 
other groups that helped develop the guidelines are the american 
cancer society the american diabetes association the american 
dietetic association the centers for disease control the national 
cancer institute the national heart lung and blood institute and

the fabled loch ness monster is worth 42 million 
in annual tourist revenues to scotland a published report said 
monday 
half a million tourists visit the highlands lake each year in 
hopes of seeing the creature although there is no scientific proof 
it exists said the times of london 
it quoted mackay consultants of inverness as saying the monster 
myth is also good for about 2500 touristindustry jobs 
we were amazed by the results of our research which certainly 
puts the monster forward as one of the main attractions of 
scotland said a director of the firm tony mackay 
he said reports of monster sightings help keep up tourist 
interest the latest was last month when a visitor from glasgow 
claimed to have caught a glimpse of the creature affectionately 
known as nessie 
the legend of large creatures living in 750footdeep loch ness 
has been around since the sixth century 
one theory holds that the monster is actually a dinosaur species 
called the plesiosaur known from fossil remains as a large water 
reptile with a small head long neck short tail and four 
paddlelike limbs 
but no such remains have been found at loch ness

greece and the united states on monday 
opened a final round of talks expected to lead to a pact permitting 
the continued operation of us military bases here 
government spokesman vyron polydoras said the talks were 
expected to last until the end of the week 
he refused to provide any details about the expected content of 
the agreement but said it would cover eight years rather than five 
as the previous pact did 
that accord expired in december 1988 
the new agreement will need the approval of the 300member greek 
parliament but the conservative government of premier constantine 
mitsotakis controls enough seats to win the vote 
the previous round of talks ended in washington on friday 
the united states has four bases and 20 smaller facilities 
around the country

university researchers have developed 
an airconditioning system they say is so sensitive it can adjust a 
buildings temperature according to the type of clothes the 
occupants are wearing 
the adelaide university research team hopes the system will 
revolutionize building climate controls by ensuring that office air 
will never be too cold or too warm 
the team leader professor sam luxton also believes the system 
will stop the spread of respiratory infections because it 
eliminates the circulation of stale bacteriaridden air in air 
conditioning 
three world patents have been taken out on the technology which 
is being installed in a shopping mall in central melbourne and a 
50story building in perth 
luxton said the new technology could result in energy savings of 
15 percent to 40 percent 
the problem with most airconditioning systems is that air 
must be cooled too much to remove moisture luxton said the 
result is that you either have people shivering saying its too 
cold or else saying its stuffy and they feel they cant breathe 
the research teams solution involves varying the size of 
components in the cooling system and in doing so eliminating the 
need for stale air to be recirculated to keep rooms warm 
recirculated air which bypasses filtering systems is thought 
to be a major carrier of bacteria that cause respiratory infections 
another feature of the new technology is a computer program that 
allows the system to adjust the temperature according to the season 
the way it works is a closely guarded secret but luxton said it 
involved a sensing system which calculates the amount of 
clothes people are wearing 
he said many airconditioning systems are programmed to maintain 
a constant temperature yearround or are adjusted manually each 
season but the set temperature may be too cold or too warm 
depending on the type of clothes being worn he noted 
luxton said the technology took more than 20 years to develop

message to washington hostesses dont invite 
caspar weinberger and robert mcfarlane to the same party 
the two prominent personalities of the irancontra period have 
been engaged in unusually strident personal attacks on each other 
for their respective roles during the reagan administration 
mcfarlane is a man of evident limitations weinberger 
writes he could not hide them but he attempted to do so by 
means of an enigmatic manner featuring heavily measured 
pretentious and usually near impenetrable prose 
mcfarlane in turn derides weinbergers newly published memoirs 
as an astonishing antiintellectual ad hominem tract a 
meanspirited assemblage of distortions and falsities of which i 
am the chief though not the only target 
at issue are the recollections of both officials of the 198586 
period when weinberger was secretary of defense and mcfarlane was 
national security adviser and later a diplomatic trouble shooter on 
iran for president reagan 
weinberger has written a book fighting for peace on his 
years at the pentagon a chapter of the book was excerpted by 
national review magazine which also published mcfarlanes response 
weinberger portrays mcfarlane as obsessed with mcfarlanes plan 
to try to improve relations with iran mcfarlane was able to use 
his easy access to reagan to distort reality and to override the 
objections of weinberger and secretary of state george p shultz to 
the iran initiative weinberger says 
to the best of my knowledge mcfarlane kept these matters as 
secret as possible talking only about the advantages of a new 
working relationship with iran when that is he discussed these 
initiatives at all weinberger wrote 
mcfarlane plunged ahead even though there was nothing to 
indicate a significant change in irans attitude on the american 
hostages in lebanon or any shift in irans virulently 
antiwestern antiamerican attitude the former pentagon chief 
says 
weinberger implies that mcfarlane in september 1985 approved the 
israeli transfer of american arms to iran without reagans approval 
mcfarlane responds by saying the independent commission headed 
by former sen john tower and the joint congressional committee 
both concluded that reagan did approve the transfer 
mcfarlane dismisses as an outright lie weinbergers 
assertion that mcfarlane passed intelligence on iraqi positions to 
iran during the gulf war he accuses weinberger of a tilt 
toward iraq ridiculing the former defense secretarys suggestion 
that iraq had rational limited aims 
mcfarlane accepts responsibility for the error of the iran 
initiative but says weinberger was too passive in his opposition 
there is no doubt that if mr weinberger had expressed the 
depth of his apparent conviction by an offer to resign or by 
resigning the operation would have come to a halt he wrote 
he also blames weinberger for the inability of the reagan 
administration to develop a coherent politicomilitary strategy 
that he says was a direct consequence of secretary 
weinbergers personal animus toward secretaries of state alexander 
haig and george shultz and his ambition to succeed them 
in a brief rebuttal to mcfarlanes response weinberger says he 
finds absurd and breathtakingly wrong mcfarlanes assertion 
that weinberger was a party to our getting into this iran 
quagmire 
the quotes that weinberger says mcfarlane manufactured cannot 
change what really happened weinberger says 
no diversionary dust in the form of easily refutable charges 
about the record of others can change the history i set forth in 
fighting for peace he writes

burmas main prodemocracy party said 
monday it was assured of an absolute majority following national 
elections and the military regime pledged to return power to the 
people after 30 years of authoritarian rule 
officials of the national league for democracy said the party 
had won 241 of the 485 national legislature seats contested sunday 
they said an absolute majority was certain when final official 
results were compiled in about three weeks 
the vote was burmas first free election in three decades 
results of 20 district races were announced on state radio and 
the league for democracy had won 18 of them 
in most districts the prodemocracy party won about 75 percent 
of the votes while the promilitary national unity party managed 
only 10 percent to 15 percent the radio said 
the ruling military junta conceded that the league for democracy 
had scored a major victory in both urban and rural areas and it 
promised to relinquish power as soon as a new constitution is 
approved 
any government that is formed according to the constitution 
will be strong and stable it is totally up to the elected members 
of the new legislature they can move as quickly as they like and 
take power said spokesman kyaw sann 
but officials of the regime said they believed the drafting of 
the document would take time they refused to speculate on how long 
it could take 
several hundred people gathered in front of the ramshackle 
headquarters of the league for democracy which was festooned with 
strings of lights and red posters 
it is an excellent day for burma we are making a new history 
i hope said bahan an executive committee member of the national 
league contacted in rangoon we hope with this mandate by the 
people we can go on to change to a democratic system very easily 
and peacefully 
we came to pray for an nld victory said one young woman 
visiting the shwedagon pagoda an ancient edifice with soaring 
golden spires overlooking the city 
sundays election was contested by 93 political groups and 2297 
candidates it was to seat a 492seat national legislature which 
will draft a constitution balloting was carried out in 485 
constituencies and postponed for security and other reasons in 
seven 
burmas rulers called the election after suppressing a 
prodemocracy uprising in 1988 in which thousands of people were 
killed 
western diplomats contacted in rangoon said some peoples 
reactions to the results were tempered with caution given the 
militarys past record 
there is euphoria in the party but it is not so evident in 
the streets there is a certain buoyancy perhaps but people arent 
exactly drinking themselves blind drunk in the streets or anything 
like that yet said one diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
burmese have had too many shocks in the past few years and 
they are waiting to see what is the final result i think he 
said 
the leagues gains came despite the house arrest of aung san suu 
kyi who helped form the party during the dramatic events of 1988 
and the imprisonment of party coleader tin oo 
one gets the impression that although she was not able to 
contest this election her influence her aura her persona have in 
fact been a very dominant factor australian ambassador geoff 
allen said of ms suu kyi 
first of all we are going to release all the political 
prisoners including aung san suu kyi and tin oo myint u a 
league official said when asked what the party would do if it 
scored a commanding victory 
before the election some critics charged the vote would not be 
free and fair they noted widespread arrests intimidation and the 
detentions of major opposition figures 
there was no official turnout given but some unofficial 
estimates in rangoon said the turnout in the capital was more than 
60 percent 
some observers are skeptical the military will easily hand over 
control after more than a quartercentury of almost total power 
the australian ambassador said in an interview that the polling 
had gone off much better than most people had anticipated but 
that the election as a whole had been flawed by the detentions 
and other past events 
what has been very encouraging is the way the burmese people 
have come out and shown in a dramatic way that they are not really 
happy with the status quo and are basically looking for a very 
different future he said in that way it has been a most 
dramatic outcome

boris n yeltsin on monday renewed his bid to 
become president of russia the soviet unions largest republic 
after failing to muster enough votes in the first two rounds of 
balloting 
in the last round of voting saturday yeltsin fell 28 votes 
short of the 531 votes he needed in the russian congress on 
friday yeltsin captured 497 votes 
the populist politician told the 1060member congress on monday 
he was willing to form a coalition with his opponents 
he invited members of the communist party bloc and others to 
work out a deal that would please the majority of russian 
deputies 
yeltsins opponents in tuesdays contest will be the republics 
current premier alexander vlasov and valentin tsoy a 
littleknown businessman from the soviet far east 
vlasov has the support of president mikhail s gorbachev who 
has urged the deputies not to elect yeltsin 
russia the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
stretches from the baltic to the pacific and includes moscow and 
many major cities its language predominates in the soviet union 
and the republic has more than half the countrys population 
yeltsin called on the deputies to reject the central soviet 
governments program for a transition to a partial market economy 
which was announced last week 
the congress must take the citizens of russia under its 
defense he said 
the economic plan which will double food prices has set off 
widespread panic buying and gorbachev went on television sunday 
night to try to calm fears 
discontent over the economic program has boosted yeltsins 
chances said one of his backers lawmaker leonid gurevich of 
murmansk 
i think he has even more support because during the break on 
sunday many deputies had a chance to talk to their voters and saw 
the greater tension resulting from price rises and empty stores 
said gurevich 
some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people 
could lose their jobs as a result of the reforms expected to drive 
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy 
under the threestep reform plan to be implemented through 
1995 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public 
sector and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices other 
prices would remain under state control

with the summer fun season under way fewer 
lifeguards dirtier restrooms pricier parking and litter pileups 
threaten to mar outings in the northeast as state recreational 
areas feel the bite of budget cuts 
final budget figures are not yet in but service cutbacks are 
being considered in several states including new york connecticut 
and new jersey in massachusetts even an ersatz henry david 
thoreau was in danger at one point of being laid off 
most parks will remain open but with reduced hours and staffing 
the grass is going to get a little longer and the restrooms 
are going to get a little dirtier said anthony cantele a 
connecticut department of environmental protection official 
most states in the region have been grappling with budget 
difficulties in the past couple of years because of an economic 
slowdown in fields such as real estate and finance 
last year connecticut decided to close 13 of its 92 state 
parks but public opposition spurred gov william oneill to 
overrule the order park funds instead were cut by 8 percent a 10 
percent cut was imposed for 1990 
the massachusetts department of environmental management which 
oversees state parks and beaches has been tentatively allocated 
29 million for overseeing state recreation facilities this year 
down from 332 million just two years ago said spokesman peter 
oneil 
along the 38milelong salisbury state beach fewer than than 
20 lifeguards will oversee waters previously covered by 50 to 55 
guards 
could that be dangerous absolutely oneil said adding 
that the department was checking with attorneys about the 
situations possible liability problems 
there have been no drownings when lifeguards are on duty since 
1980 oneil said there are 50 to 60 documented saves each 
summer 
massachusetts has 146 forests and parks seven ocean beaches 20 
swimming pools and seven historical parks 
about 80 jobs vacant through attrition probably will not be 
filled and oneil said only about 800 seasonal employees would be 
hired down from the usual 1300 
new jersey which has an extensive state park system also faces 
staff cuts because of a possible 1 million reduction in the 
departments 234 million budget 
greg marsh new jersey director of division of parks and 
forests said a proposed 2 increase in parking fees would 
eliminate the need for layoffs 
some officials warn that reductions in park maintenance may harm 
the envirnoment 
what were really concerned about is illegal dumping oneil 
said in the past folks would see someone in uniform and keep on 
going now they might not keep on going 
marsh also fears increased litter problems a small pile of 
trash at the side of a road attracts a large pile quickly he said 
adding that park rangers will urge campers to carry their own trash 
from campsites 
new yorks 150 state parks which include 65 campgrounds will 
be open but with reduced hours said parks department spokesman 
robert arnold 
budget woes almost forced massachusetts to halt a walden pond 
summer program that hires a tour guide to play famed naturalist 
henry david thoreau oneil said 
the guide is henry david thoreau always speaking in the 
present tense when he tells visitors about the life of the famous 
philosopher oneil said we now think hes going to be back

a major early painting by peter paul rubens 
the fall of phaeton will go on permanent display at the 
national gallery of art on wednesday the 350th anniversary of the 
death of the 17th century flemish master of the baroque 
the 3by4 oil which depicts a dramatic scene from greek 
mythology was bought by the gallery last year from an undisclosed 
private collection in london for a sum that director j carter 
brown described only as in the multimilliondollar range 
the painting was cleaned to restore its original colors to their 
former brilliance and joins the eight other works from rubens 
later period in the national gallerys permanent collection in the 
west building 
except for its inclusion in an exhibition in cologne west 
germany in 1977 before it was cleaned the fall of the 
phaeton had never been displayed publicly 
little is known of its ownership since rubens painted it in 1605 
while studying in italy 
brown and arthur wheelock the gallerys curator of northern 
baroque painting said the painting is important because of what it 
tells about rubens in the early formative stage of his development 
as the greatest baroque artist 
this was the springboard of his career into fullblown 
baroque said brown who praised the paintings extraordinary 
command of threedimensional space and a sophisticated 
composition that conveys swing and power and grandeur 
the painting shows a scene from ovids metamorphoses in 
which apollos son is thrown from his horsedrawn chariot in the 
heavens by a blinding thunderbolt hurled by jupiter 
wheelock said the cleaning revealed pink hues not previously 
seen in the painting and an xray examination by gallery 
conservators showed that rubens had painted over one figure in the 
lower righthand corner of the scene 
brown also announced the acquisition of the gallerys first work 
by the 17th century dutch painter aert van der neer a nocturnal 
landscape titled moonlit landscape with bridge that was painted 
in 1650 
both the rubens and van der neer paintings were bought with 
income from the gallerys permanent acquisition fund

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will go 
into his meetings with president bush in a strong position 
despite political turmoil at home a soviet veteran of recent 
superpower summits said monday 
nikolai shishlin an adviser to the central committee of the 
soviet communist party spoke at a soviet embassy news conference 
called to discuss cultural and other issues in advance of the 
summit 
gorbachev is due to arrive on wednesday and begin talks with 
bush on thursday 
in moscow the soviet leader made a hastily scheduled television 
appearance sunday night to appeal for calm in the face of a wave of 
panic buying caused by government plans to triple bread prices on 
july 1 
bush speaking to reporters near his home in kennebunkport 
maine before returning to washington after a memorial day weekend 
break said he believes gorbachev is pretty darn strong despite 
the economic crisis 
shishlin spoke in response to a question about how the summit 
might be affected by the outcome of elections in the soviet 
republic of russia in which boris yeltsin a critic of gorbachevs 
policies was a leading candidate 
speaking through a translator shishlin said i believe that 
for all the tumultuous political process that has developed in 
soviet society for all the posturing and emotion that is building 
up inside the country for all the painful and critical nature of 
the moments we are living through the expansion of perestroika is 
proceeding 
regardless of the result of elections in the republic of 
russia the position of gorbachev at present is a strong position 
and a position of authority he said

history and a journalist who has been on the faculty of various 
higher educational institutions in moscow and taken part in recent 
sovietamerican summits he was also described as host of a

president bush is being asked by 170 house 
democrats to step into the worsening savings and loan crisis more 
and request additional funds from congress to investigate prosecute 
fraud in the industry 
the democrats led by rep charles e schumer of new york sent 
a letter friday to bush saying the 50 million appropriated to the 
justice department to investigate and prosecute sampl fraud isnt 
enough to handle the backlog of thousands of potential criminal 
cases 
an additional 100 million is needed said the democrats 
including some lawmakers who last week accused the justice 
department of dragging its feet on prosecuting thrift fraud 
sean young a white house spokesman said over the weekend that 
bush had not received the letter yet and would have no immediate 
comment on it 
bush said at a news conference last thursday the savings and 
loan crisis causes me great concern and that policymakers 
first priority is protecting depositors against losses 
the administration last week dramatically raised its estimates 
of how much new borrowing the government needs to clean up the 
savings and loan mess instead of the 50 billion forecast a year 
ago treasury secretary nicholas brady said between 90 billion and 
130 is now needed 
including interest on the money borrowed the cost to taxpayers 
of covering the sampl losses is expected to exceed 325 billion over 
the next 30 years 
brady unveiled the new estimate the same day that bushs son 
neil was testifying before the house banking committee on the 1 
billion collapse of silverado banking savings and loan 
association neil bush was a director of the failed denver thrift 
the panels chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said he 
plans to ask attorney general dick thornburgh to testify before the 
committee later 
democrats on the house committee including schumer have 
criticized the justice department for earmarking only 50 million 
to investigate sampl fraud instead of the 75 million that congress 
last year authorized for the task as part of the bailout 
legislation 
the american people are being asked to foot the bill of a 
bailout that may well exceed several hundred billion dollars the 
house democrats wrote in their letter friday to bush they demand 
in return that the criminals who looted the thrift industry be 
brought to justice 
they asked bush to reevaluate the number of personnel needed to 
vigorously investigate and prosecute alleged fraud and embezzlement 
and seek increased appropriations from congress to meet those needs 
at this time we believe that the department of justice 
requires close to 100 million in additional funds to meet these 
personnel needs their letter said 
justice department officials have claimed they already are 
spending nearly that amount in addition to the 50 million from 
the bailout legislation department officials say they are spending 
a roughly equivalent amount from previously appropriated money on 
investigating sampl fraud

solidarity leader lech walesa who won 
fame leading a shipyard workers strike a decade ago persuaded 
rail workers monday to suspend a strike that had crippled train 
service in northern poland 
service resumed after walesa made a latenight appeal to the 
workers who had threatened a 90minute nationwide walkout later 
monday the workers agreed to return to their jobs while the 
government reviews a list of demands including pay raises 
a week of sporadic labor disputes had stalled freight and 
passenger transport paralyzed polands baltic ports and posed a 
threat to the solidarityled government 
on our road to democracy there are various dangerous curves 
and the railway workers protest was one of them walesa said 
we all have to draw conclusions from it 
the agreement calls for government review of the strikers 
demands for pay raises and reforms of the rail system until now 
the government has insisted that giving into the rail workers could 
set off a series of wage demands that could hurt drastic economic 
reforms under way 
the transport ministry said after normal rail traffic is 
restored the management of the staterun railway will meet with 
unions to discuss their grievances 
passenger service was expected to be normal by tuesday but 
freight traffic bottlenecks were expected to take longer to clear 
up 
walesa said he would meet with the strike committee in two weeks 
to assess progress 
the rail workers strike committee in a communique called on 
the solidaritybacked government to reshape its economic reforms so 
the burden of the crisis is spread over the whole society 
poles have been reeling under the impact of big price increases 
combined with a sharp drop in real wages the economic reform 
effort is using shock treatment to jolt polands moribund 
centralized economy into a market system 
the program includes cutting the subsidies to state industries 
including the railroad that allowed them to charge 
unrealistically low rates and grant pay raises without regard to 
profitability 
government spokesman zbigniew augustynowicz welcomed the 
suspension of the rail strike saying it certainly makes the 
situation easier 
this is a fulfillment of what the government expected he 
said the government has always said it would not talk under the 
gun of a strike 
walesa went to strike headquarters in the northwest city of 
slupsk at midnight sunday for talks that stretched into the early 
hours of monday 
strikers had asked him to return following his first failed 
attempt to settle the dispute the night before walesa aides said 
walesa said the agreement suspending the strike included no 
promises that would be impossible to fulfill later 
the labor dispute had cast a shadow over national local 
government elections which drew only a 42 percent turnout on 
sunday 
the settlement even though temporary relieves a crisis for the 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
mazowiecki had appealed for an end to the strike saying the 
hardships already suffered under the 5monthold economic program 
would increase if there were exceptions to the antiinflation drive 
walesa who holds no government post but wields tremendous 
personal influence became an emissary for the government despite 
his own differences with mazowiecki on the pace of reforms 
a decade ago walesa was an electrician in the gdansk shipyard 
where solidarity was formed during labor upheaval in which 
gorbachev played a leading role solidarity was crushed after the 
communists imposed martial law in december 1981 it was restored to 
legal status in april 1989 
the government had no direct comment on walesas role it said 
only through an aide in the press office that every initiative 
leading to the ending of strikes is valuable 
during walesas meetings with workers he assured them he was 
not an agent of the government and would join their fight if 
negotiations do not work 
your demands are right but the form that you are doing it in 
a strike in the present situation is anarchy on the road to the 
construction of a democracy walesa told the workers early sunday 
the strikers demands include pay of up to 79 a month which is 
110 percent of the average national wage they also pressed for 
dismissal of the holdover communist managers they contended were 
incompetent and hindering reforms 
the strikes began may 20 as wildcat sitins the government 
initially refused to negotiate because the workers were not 
represented by any legal labor organization 
but by midweek the cause was taken up by the opzz labor 
federation which was created by the communists in 1982 when 
solidarity was banned walesa said the legitimate difficulties of 
the rail workers were being manipulated by the people who led 
this country to ruin referring to the communists 
more than 40 years of communist party rule ended in august when 
parliament approved a solidarityled coalition government headed by 
mazowiecki a former opposition activist

cashiers shouted passports at crowds of testy 
shoppers on monday the first day of new rules that barred 
nonmuscovites from the capitals besieged stores 
tempers flared over the rules which were intended to curb a 
wave of panicbuying that started after the government announced 
thursday it was raising prices as part of a transition to a market 
economy 
shouting matches erupted between cashiers and shoppers who did 
not know about the rules long lines moved slowly as the internal 
passports were scrutinized for the stamp that proved residency 
passports citizens passports demanded a cashier at food 
store no 44 moscow or moscow region only 
she refused to take the money of people who had forgotten their 
documents but softened her stance toward an elderly man who said 
he was a veteran of world war ii 
at supermarket no 30 on gorky street about 70 people jammed 
the front door after the lunch break three policemen waved 
truncheons to clear a narrow path so shoppers could exit once they 
had their purchases the police hit no one with their truncheons 
i quite agree with the passport measures said valentina 
guskova a 63yearold pensioner from the moscow region who was 
shopping in a bread store on gorky street those people from 
other regions they used to flock to moscow and strip shop shelves 
bare today i can at least buy something for my grandchildren 
here 
besides the residency requirement which already has been 
adopted by other large cities rationing was introduced on some 
goods and tightened on others the residency requirement will be in 
effect in moscow for two weeks 
president mikhail s gorbachev in a speech sunday night in 
which he appealed for people not to panic said an anxious mood 
has arisen in the country in connection with the consideration by 
the supreme soviet parliament of the governments report on the 
transition to a market economy 
he gave no indication he planned to change his plans to move 
forward on what his aides are calling regulated market economy 
gorbachev in his speech gave assurances that the needy would 
be compensated and that those thrown out of work would be retrained 
for new jobs some economists have estimated that up to 40 million 
people could lose their jobs in the reforms which are expected to 
drive many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy 
the plan calls for bread prices to triple to 109 a loaf on 
july 1 and for other food prices to double on average starting jan 
1 bread makes up about 20 percent of the average soviet diet 
according to premier nikolai ryzhkov 
the threephase reform plan to carry through 1995 calls for 
about 60 percent of state enterprises to be sold to the private 
sector in the immediate future 15 percent of prices will be 
freed with controls to be lifted toward the end of the period 
many prices would remain under state control and many 
industries would stay in state hands over the opposition of 
radical reformers 
during debate in the supreme soviet on monday many lawmakers 
argued that it did not go far enough especially in increasing the 
production of consumer goods 
the government tass news agency reported an abundance of goods 
such as smoked meats fowl fish and sausage in moscow stores 
monday spot checks also found some exotic goods such as vietnamese 
vodka and nicaraguan rum 
cashier tatyana andruykhina who blushed as she was seen hiding 
a bottle of the rum under her counter at supermarket no 30 said 
the new rules will make her job harder 
now ive got to check peoples passports in addition to the 
usual duties said miss andruykhina 19 
tass said the passport checks were not being universally 
enforced in all stores despite notices on the doors that such 
documents were required 
v kazakov who described himself as unemployed told tass that 
he could not find the special department set up by the moscow city 
council to protect needy muscovites 
i lost my passport three years ago and had no necessity to get 
a new one kazakov said and now should i die of hunger

president bush said monday that 
mikhail s gorbachev is pretty darn strong despite economic 
woes plaguing the soviet union but bush virtually closed the door 
on giving moscow trade benefits during summit talks this week 
i go to the summit with open arms to welcome the president of 
the soviet union bush said winding up four days of vacation to 
return to washington for talks beginning thursday 
in this seaside resort where he has spent nearly every summer of 
his life bush was the star attraction at the memorial day parade 
of veterans school bands and fire trucks through dock square 
basking in sunshine and surrounded by his wife children and 
grandchildren bush called it a little piece of americana some 
people in the crowd of several thousand people flinched when a 
military honor guard unexpectedly fired a loud rifle salute near 
the president 
bush told the crowd that as he meets with gorbachev things 
have changed dramatically theres no question that we have a 
better chance now for a lasting world peace 
but there are still some enormous problems out there he 
said and this country must remain strong 
bush has made an effort in the days before the summit to 
emphasize that gorbachev despite his problems is a powerful 
world leader who has the authority to make deals with the united 
states administration officials reason that even if gorbachev is 
replaced his successors would be bound by any agreements he signs 
gorbachev went on soviet television sunday night to appeal to 
his countrymen for calm in the face of panic buying triggered by 
moscows plans to double the prices of food and other goods 
i think we spend too much time trying to figure out how long a 
leader in any country will be there bush said answering 
reporters questions at a country club as he teed off for a final 
round of golf 
i mean this man has survived bush said ive given him 
appropriate credit for the dramatic changes in eastern europe 
conducting himself in a manner that none of us would have predicted 
possible two years ago 
and so ill deal with him bush said and my own personal 
opinion is that hes pretty darn strong there and i say that after 
talking to an awful lot of soviet experts 
sharp differences over german unity and soviet coercion of 
lithuania threaten to put a cloud over the summit 
a major soviet goal for the summit had been to win 
mostfavorednation trade status with the united states giving 
moscow the lowest possible tariffs on its exports to the united 
states in fact improved trade is probably more important than 
arms deals for gorbachev given his economic problems 
bush noted that moscow has not enacted a law protecting jewish 
emigration which he had demanded as a price for ending trade 
barriers 
so i dont think that issue will be an action item for the 
summit bush said i expect it will be talked about because as 
they move toward a free market economy trade with the west is 
vitally important to them 
and id say that certain items are very important to us as 
well bush said singling out pressure on the baltic states as an 
issue that concerns me enormously 
bush said he did not expect any surprises from gorbachev and had 
none up his sleeve 
asked if he was ready for the summit bush leaning against a 
golf club smiled and said ive got some more work to do but 
ive been reading my briefing books

in the netherlands after they tragically mistook them for 
british soldiers

an electronics problem with a 
computerized display unit in the space shuttle columbia resulted in 
extra lastminute work for nasa on monday but was not expected to 
delay this weeks launch 
thats really our only problem everything else is going very 
smoothly said nasa test director al sofge 
columbia is scheduled to lift off at 1238 am edt wednesday 
carrying seven astronauts and a 150 million observatory known as 
astro that will be used to study ultraviolet light and xrays 
emitted by stars and other objects 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
noticed sunday that the socalled headup display which 
projects an image of data needed by the shuttles commander during 
landings was displaying incorrect information technicians 
replaced the display but that did not fix the problem 
officials determined monday that the units electronics package 
was at fault and began the eighthour job of replacing it the 
package is about the size of a videocassette recorder and is 
located in the shuttles middeck 
the display unit will be tested for eight hours after the new 
device is installed 
we can do it in parallel with all the other countdown 
activities without impacting those activities sofge said 
air force forecasters were predicting an 80 percent chance of 
favorable weather at launch time 
the nine to 10day mission the first one in five years to be 
devoted entirely to scientific research already has been delayed 
two weeks because of repairs to the shuttles cooling system 
additional delays could mean even more changes to astros observing 
schedule 
because of the delay fewer observations are planned of comet 
austin which is receding rapidly from earth the comet is believed 
to be on its first trip through the solar system 
its sort of fading quickly were hoping we can still get 
some observations in but were not as optimistic said arthur 
davidsen chief investigator for astros hopkins ultraviolet 
telescope 
jupiter and some stars cannot be studied now because they are 
too close to the sun davidsen said monday if astros three 
ultraviolet telescopes or one xray telescope point toward the sun 
their instruments could be damaged 
well still make use of every second on the shuttle 
davidsen said 
one target a quasar 10 billion light years from earth is in 
a better position now than it was a month ago davidsen said the 
quasar will be the faintest object observed by astro 
the four astronomers in the crew will use computers to operate 
the ultraviolet telescopes round the clock the xray telescope 
will be controlled by computer commands sent from goddard space 
flight center in greenbelt md 
astronomers expect astro to complement the work of the hubble 
space telescope deployed last month in a 380milehigh orbit 
during the last shuttle flight the hubble cannot detect xrays and 
cannot see as much detail in ultraviolet images as astro 
nasa program scientist ed weiler sees hubble as a basic toolbox 
and astro as extra tools 
you can do most jobs at home with that basic toolbox but 
there are always unique things you want to do which might require a 
ratchet wrench or a power drill weiler said monday astro is 
the ratchet wrench the power drill

still unaccounted for

caskets as it was opened ceremoniously to be checked and saw a 
skeleton beneath a white silk cloth 
all i could think was that one or two of these unidentified 
might have been one or two of my friends said campbell who 
served 13 months in korea in the air force

korea to improve relations with the united states the two 
countries do not have diplomatic relations

with north korea confirming he received the remains 
this is a historic occasion recognition for americans who 
fought in korea recognition that has not come for 40 years 
montgomery said

prisoners still alive in north korea saying both soviet and north 
korean diplomats had assured them it was untrue

the house agriculture committee is dealing 
with growing opposition in congress to millionaire farmers who 
receive federal subsidies 
reps timothy penny dminn and dan glickman dkan proposed 
last week that the 1990 farm bill be amended in committee to cut 
off subsidies to farmers who gross more than 2 million a year 
the idea rankled members who view subsidies not as a welfare 
program for needy farmers but as the governments way to ensure a 
steady supply of food in an industry that by nature is cyclical 
our intention is to hear what people think about the issue 
said glickman chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and 
feed grains the mostly highly subsidized crops 
the size of government subsidies have been gradually falling 
since the alltime record of 26 billion in 1986 but efforts to 
cut the federal deficit have put a tighter squeeze on farm programs 
rep jerry huckaby dla said the glickmanpenny proposal 
would be the beginning of the end of the farm program 
rep pat roberts rkan another critic of the plan called 
glickman a legislative activist who needs to find the woolly 
bears of the farm bill and expose them on a weekly basis 
rep glenn english dokla said the proposal challenged the 
philosophy of the farm program 
this program is designed to help the family farmer balance 
supply and demand he said contending that the glickmanpenny 
proposal would make it a welfare program 
several members argued that gross revenues werent an indication 
of a farmers wealth because production costs often absorb so much 
of a producers income 
the livestock business for example is low profit said 
rep denny smith rore returns are 2 to 4 percent you have a 
huge investment for a small turnaround 
john campbell deputy undersecretary of agriculture said the 
bush administration was responsible in part for starting the debate 
over the subsidies 
our preference would be to stay on course he told the 
committee but he said that if agriculture spending was not brought 
down the administration may support a move such as that suggested 
by glickman and penny 
a coalition led by reps richard armey rtexas and charles 
schumer dny has announced it will fight some subsidy programs 
when the bill gets to the floor 
armey has said hell introduce an amendment to cut off payments 
to any farmer who has annual profits over 100000 
since the food shortages and farm failures of the great 
depression the federal government and agriculture have been 
intertwined through a farm bill that is passed every five years 
supporters of the programs say participation by wealthy farmers 
assures they will cooperate with the government in areas they may 
not otherwise be so inclined for example subsidy programs often 
include requirements that certain acreage be set aside for 
conservation or supply management 
penny said the 2 million figure he and glickman proposed as a 
cutoff for federal subsidies was based on limits allowed under the 
disaster payment legislation passed last year to aid drought 
victims

robert b meyner a country lawyer who 
became new jerseys first governor elected to successive fouryear 
terms has died after a long illness he was 81 
meyner who gained national attention during his terms in office 
from 1954 to 1962 had been in declining health since suffering a 
stroke in 1986 he died in his sleep sunday at his home in captiva

he lived a very full rich life giving an awful lot to a lot 
of people mrs meyner said monday by telephone from captiva 
a democrat meyner campaigned tirelessly to win the states 
highest office at a time when republicans dominated state 
government he was the first democratic governor since 1940

a fiscal conservative meyner was credited with keeping a 
balanced state budget and with ably administering basic state 
needs such as water supply and land management he oversaw the 
completion of the new jersey turnpike in the mid1950s 
his success in the state put him in demand for speaking 
engagements across the country from 1958 to early 1960 he was 
considered a possibility for the democratic nomination for 
president 
he left office because state law prohibits governors from 
serving three consecutive terms in 1969 he was nominated for 
another term losing to republican william t cahill 
meyner gave credibility to the governors office and the state 
democratic party said former gov brendan byrne meyners 
secretary from 1956 to 1958 
he took a bosscontrolled democratic party and insisted on a 
public integrity which remains the standard in new jersey said

a policemanturned congressman takes on 
a wealthy former utility executive in tuesdays republican 
gubernatorial primary while gov bill clinton attempts to avoid a 
runoff in his bid for the democratic nomination 
us sen david pryor a democrat seeking a third term is 
unopposed for renomination but faces a writein candidate in the 
november general election rep bill alexander a democrat seeking 
a 12th term faces a stiff primary challenge from attorney mike 
gibson in the 1st district 
the republican gubernatorial race pits rep tommy robinson a 
former police chief and sheriff from jacksonville against 
sheffield nelson of little rock who led arkla inc a natural gas 
utility from 1973 to 1984 
arkansas voters may participate in either primary without making 
a commitment for the november general election and some traditional 
democrats may opt for the gop primary since both robinson and 
nelson switched parties last year 
clinton faces five opponents including tom mcrae former 
president of the winthrop rockefeller foundation named for a 
former governor a poll released friday showed clinton with 55 
percent and mcrae 22 percent with 19 percent undecided and the 
three other candidates with 3 percent or less 
to avoid a runoff clinton must get more than 50 percent of the 
vote if no democrat does the two top finishers will square off 
june 12 
kentucky also has a primary tuesday in which democratic voters 
will decide whether state schools superintendent john brock and 
former louisville mayor harvey sloane gets to challenge incumbent 
republican sen mitch mcconnell in november 
two of kentuckys democratic congressmen also face primary 
challenges 10term incumbent rep romano mazzoli in louisvilles 
3rd district and rep chris perkins seeking to retain the eastern 
kentucky seat held by his father the late carl perkins for three 
decades 
arkansas state auditor julia hughes jones estimated voter 
turnout would top 600000 the highest for a primary since records 
were first kept in 1966 the state has nearly 12 million 
registered voters 
the main issue in the republican campaign has been business 
deals between arkla inc and arkoma productions owned by nelsons 
pal jerry jones who grew up with robinson in north little rock 
in december 1982 arkla sold a halfinterest in its gas drilling 
leases on 20500 acres in arkansas to arkoma for 15 million 
arkoma eventually spent an additional 35 million on drilling and 
other costs in 1986 arkla bought back its leases along with the 
rest of arkoma for 1748 million 
robinson 48 said it was a sleazy deal and severed his long 
financial ties and friendship with jones nelson who left the 
company in 1984 said that if his successors had bought arkoma in 
1985 they could have gotten it for 85 million 
clinton 43 was the nations youngest governor when he was 
first elected in 1978 he lost his bid for reelection in 1980 but 
was elected again in 1982 1984 and 1986 
blacks are guaranteed more representation in the legislature 
because 31 legislative districts were redrawn including 10 new 
majorityblack districts in eastern and southern arkansas half of 
those 10 seats are being sought by only black candidates that 
means there will be at least one more black in the senate for a 
total of two and three more in the house up from five when the 
1990 elections are over

a film that equates criminals who rape and murder 
without mercy or regret with the communist partys actions over 72 
years is already a sensation before it opens at moscow movie 
theaters 
the new documentary this is no way to live by stanislav 
govorukhin breaks most of the last taboos left in the glasnost era 
govorukhin rolls the tragedies of communist rule the 
humiliation of soviet life and his personal indignation at the 
fate of his country into an indictment so powerful it would seem 
authorities would have to ban the film 
but the authorities have changed 
the foreign ministry staged a screening moscow city council 
deputies have pledged to bring the movie to cinemas govorukhin 
said president mikhail s gorbachev himself proclaimed the film 
wonderful after a private viewing 
for the life of me i cant understand how gorbachev could 
like it he said sounding distressed 
this is no way to live begins with graphic scenes of rape 
and murder in a style familiar to viewers of leningrad tvs 600 
seconds a daily program that frequently shows grisly crime 
scenes 
then it moves into part 2 criminals in power 
beginning with the 1918 murder of czar nicholas ii and other 
members of the royal romanov family it presents viewers with one 
bolshevik crime against the people after another 
it documents the mass slaughter of the bourgeoisie under 
lenin the artifically created famines the tens of millions of 
deaths and imprisonments under stalin the destruction of churches 
and liquidation of the priesthood the distortion of peoples 
consciousness with ideological propaganda and the impoverishment 
of the vast rich country through idiotic mismanagement 
the scenes shift next to the disgusting humiliation of 
everyday soviet life with its lines shortages poverty and moral 
bankruptcy and the crooked bodies crated by such conditions and 
70 years of the wrong genetic policy 
the crimes of hitlers regime cannot begin to measure up to 
all this in scale and cruelty especially if you consider that it 
was done against ones own people govorukhin says in the films 
narration 
against footage of the postworld war ii nuremburg trials of 
nazi leaders he raises the prospect of a similar national trial of 
communists he says the organizers of a crime should bear the brunt 
of punishment 
the moscow news weekly predicted thursday that govorukhin would 
be accused of malice mockery and painting everything black by 
the very people whom he proposes for a national trial 
judging by two preliminary screenings and commentaries beginning 
to appear in the soviet press however it is mainly govorukhins 
unrelieved gloom not his political views that upsets audiences 
one viewer at the foreign ministry showing remarked that we 
all already know we cant live this way what we need to know is 
how we should live 
govorukhin a tall balding man with a deep voice offered no 
apologies for his downbeat views at questionandanswer sessions 
after the screenings 
personally im a pessimist he said i have no basis to 
think everything will get better quickly theres no one in this 
whole country except absolute idiots who doesnt think tomorrow 
will be worse and when people have no hope and god has been taken 
away from them what can you expect 
govorukhin wellknown as a journalist and director of 
commercial films said he made this is no way to live mainly as 
a letter to the supreme soviet legislature he wants wide 
distribution for the film but he was most concerned it be seen and 
understood by the countrys leaders 
soviet lawmakers already have had several screenings and 
chances are most will see the film as its fame grows two of 
moscows biggest cinemas have also committed themselves to showing 
it 
members of the russian congress saw the film earlier this week 
and its influence has already been felt on the floor 
a deputy from the russian town of saratov quoted govorukhin from 
the podium on wednesday saying if a country is this rich and the 
people are this poor thats a crime 
another deputy noted the film threw in our face the horrible 
but honest truth we can understand it differently but we all 
agree this is no way to live 
govorukhin said legislators told him the documentary made 
conservative deputies more conservative and radicals more radical 
but in all it managed to move the center slightly toward more 
reformist views if thats so then it has played its role he 
said

colombians took a stand against drug 
terrorism when they elected cesar gaviria president but there was 
another message as well 
gavirias victory in sundays election served as a warning to 
colombias political elite start listening to the people and get 
ready for changes 
during his campaign gaviria who took up his candidacy when 
his predecessor was assassinated became a symbol of resistance to 
the drug traffickers 
but he also appealed to millions of colombians who were fed up 
with the countrys political aristocracy the election results 
suggest that voters took his populist message to heart 
two political parties the liberal party and the conservative 
party have controlled colombian politics for more than 100 years 
leaders have traditionally snuffed out attempts to make the parties 
more responsive to the people 
but on sunday the conservatives went down to their wost defeat 
ever as for the liberals their candidate gaviria won but he 
comes from a faction that bucked the partys old guard 
colombias 100yearold constitution allows little political 
voice outside the two main parties but colombians voted by a 
9to1 margin in favor of an overhaul of the constitution 
commentators said the vote for gaviria was a vote for change 
gaviria has committed himself to carrying out the political 
and social transformation that colombians yearn for the bogota 
daily newspaper el espectador said monday 
colombians want to clean out the system and bring democracy 
close to the people clara lopez a former bogota city council 
president told the associated press 
gaviria was closely aligned with luis carlos galan a federal 
senator who frequently disagreed with the political chiefs of the 
liberal party 
galan later became the partys presidential candidate 
advocating a political reform and a tough stance against the drug 
traffickers he was killed by drugbacked assassins in august 
gaviria took galans place as the partys candidate and also 
kept alive galans ideas for shaking up colombias antiquated 
political structures 
the election results indicated the shakeup was starting already 
former guerrilla antonio navarro whose m19 movement laid down 
its armss in march to join the political process received a 
respectable 12 percent of the vote it was the best showing of a 
leftwing presidential candidate in colombias history 
the support his candidacy received clearly shows that immense 
possibilities of a peace process and the generous payment of the 
colombian people to those who seek peace gaviria said in his 
victory speech sunday night 
twelve percent was considered a good showing for navarro but 
the same figure was seen as a big defeat for the conservative 
party some political analysts said the weak showing could be the 
partys downfall 
one former member of the conservative partys old guard alvaro 
gomez got about 24 percent of the vote but gomez ran as an 
independent because of a feud with the conservatives 
another sign of readiness for political change was the approval 
of an assembly to debate changes in colombias 104yearold 
constitution 
among the proposals are electoral changes guaranteeing that 
minority parties get representation in congress and cabinet posts 
proponents of reform also seek to overhaul colombias justice 
system which has fallen prey to corruption and intimidation by 
drug traffickers 
gaviria has said the assembly must represent a wide spectrum of 
society it will include not just the political parties but labor 
unions peasants educators university students lawyers judges 
the military and the catholic church 
i hope that this will be an instrument of reconciliation 
between colombians gaviria said

lebanese shiites offered to trade what they 
said were the bodies of two israeli soldiers for israeliheld 
shiite prisoners but sources said monday the bodies were actually 
those of proisraeli lebanese militiamen 
the offer of a swap from the shiite moslem militia amal was 
initially published in the beirut daily alanwar on may 12 
the move came after iran and allied groups in lebanon demanded a 
gesture from israel to encourage the freeing of more western 
hostages in lebanon two american hostages frank reed and robert 
polhill were freed in april the first us captives to be 
released in 3 years 
the liberal israeli daily haaretz quoted unnamed sources as 
saying the bodies in question were actually those of lebanese 
members of the south lebanon army a 2500member force trained and 
equipped by israel to patrol a buffer zone in south lebanon 
the south lebanon army holds more than 300 shiite prisoners at 
the alkhiam prison in south lebanon 
sources who demanded anonymity said israeli experts had 
concluded the bodies being offered were not those of any of the 
israelis missing in lebanon 
the sources declined to give details but said south lebanon 
army commander antoine lahad expressed no immediate interest in 
arranging a trade on the basis of amals offer 
lahad has said any prisoner exchange must involve missing south 
lebanon army militiamen and israeli soldiers 
four israeli soldiers are missing in action since the 1982 
lebanon war and three other servicemen are believed to be held by 
shiite groups linked to the proiranian hezbollah militia 
most of the western hostages in lebanon are believed held by 
factions of hezbollah a fundamentalist shiite moslem group that 
gets considerable financial support from iran 
one of the groups demanding the release of palestinian and 
shiite lebanese prisoners in israel is the islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine which claims to hold two americans 
they are among six americans missing in lebanon the longest 
held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985

the government said monday 
that within days it will move to scrap the law that allows 
segregation of public facilities such as swimming pools and 
libraries 
the announcement marks the latest in a series of reforms by the 
government of president fw de klerk 
but in another development that appeared to be part of the 
governments campaign to get the african national congress to 
renounce political violence the ruling national party accused 
nelson mandela of holding outdated policies and not providing clear 
direction to his supporters 
the rare public criticism of mandela on monday came two days 
after the anc leader accused de klerk and his government of not 
moving fast enough to dismantle apartheid 
in cape town planning minister hernus kriel said he would 
introduce legislation this week in parliament to repeal the 
separate amenities act which allows for the segregation of a wide 
range of public facilities 
antiapartheid groups have said they would welcome the repeal of 
the act as one of several steps the government must make to 
dismantle its policies of racial segregation 
despite the law restaurants movie theaters hotels parks and 
public transportation all have been integrated in recent years 
but some conservative communities have used the separate 
amenities act to maintain whitesonly swimming pools libraries and 
recreation centers 
de klerk who assumed power in august said last year that the 
separate amenities act would be eliminated during parliaments 1990 
session 
the act does not cover schools and neighborhoods which along 
with politics are the main institutions still segregated by law 
the countrys 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs 
de klerk says he wants to end discrimination in south africa and 
negotiate a new constitution with black opposition groups 
the de klerk government earlier this month declared public 
hospitals open to all races although some aspects of the policy 
remain unclear and full implementation is expected to take months 
de klerk also has opened beaches to all races allowed peaceful 
protests legalized black opposition groups and released some 
political prisoners including mandela 
in addition the government has opened four small neighborhoods 
to all races and says it plans to change the law segregating 
residential areas possibly by next year 
mandela and the anc leadership meanwhile were criticized by 
the national partys official mouthpiece the nationalist for 
ambivalent and hesitant leadership 
mr mandelas utterances have only served to underscore 
this organizations confusing profile on important issues such as 
the armed struggle and political violence the nationalist said 
the time has come for leaders like mr mandela and others to 
give clearer stronger direction and bolder leadership to their 
followers to show it is possible for the anc to rise above 
predictable outdated populist rhetoric it added 
the government has urged the anc to renounce its largely dormant 
and ineffective guerrilla campaign the anc says it will continue 
to support armed resistance until apartheid is ended 
on saturday mandela said de klerk was not moving fast enough to 
end apartheid he also said he felt the president is not strong 
enough to end the violence going on 
police said monday they found the bodies of 12 blacks killed in 
a vicious faction fight that involved some 400 combatants 
the battle took place saturday near richmond 45 miles west of 
the port city of durban it was the latest round of blackonblack 
violence in the southeastern province of natal some 4000 blacks 
have been killed in natal since 1986 
police said the victims were shot stabbed and bludgeoned to 
death an unknown number of people were injured and about 60 huts 
were burned down police said police said one side attacked the 
other in apparent revenge for an earlier killing

a volley of rockets hit the afghan 
capital on monday killing six people and wounding 20 as a 
traditional council convened to adopt democratic reforms staterun 
radio said 
twentytwo surfacetosurface missiles fired by moslem 
guerrillas into neighborhoods in northern and western kabul caused 
extensive damage said kabul radio monitored in islamabad 
the guerrillas supported by the united states saudi arabia and 
other arab states are trying to oust the sovietbacked government 
that seized power in a violent 1978 coup the guerrillas insist 
they aim only at military targets but have admitted their rockets 
occasionally misfire and hit civilians 
hundreds of rockets have slammed into the capital in recent 
weeks killing and wounding scores of people 
diplomats said the attacks appeared to coincide with the 
convening of the loya jirgah a traditional assembly of 772 people 
representing different regions and tribal groups in afghanistan 
the council was expected to adopt constitutional reforms that 
would change the name of the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan revise the party charter to remove all references to 
its marxist past and initiate steps to end the partys monopoly on 
power 
diplomats in kabul and islamabad have said the changes appear 
largely cosmetic and cautioned against making parallels between 
afghanistan and the countries of east europe that have undergone 
dramatic democratic reforms 
in his opening address president najibullah reiterated his 
governments proposal for a peaceful settlement of the war that has 
claimed more than 15 million lives and left the country in ruins 
najibullahs plan calls for a sixmonth ceasefire an 
international peace conference and the establishment of a 
transitional government followed by internationallysupervised 
elections the president uses only one name 
war is not the way to settle the afghan problem there is no 
other way but through negotiation the 44yearold president said 
in remarks broadcast monday night i pledge to utilize my best 
efforts to bring peace to the country 
the guerrillas who are based in pakistan and control 90 percent 
of the afghan countryside have routinely refused powersharing

an unseasonable rainstorm dumped record rain 
monday on southern california which is in the fourth year of a 
drought snarling traffic and contributing to two deaths 
but the rain came too late to help with the drought warm 
weather will cause it largely to evaporate rather than percolate 
into the soil 
the storm dropped an inch of rain on los angeles the national 
weather service said the previous high may 28 precipitation was 
012 of an inch in 1971 
the santa monica freeway through downtown los angeles was closed 
for several hours during the night by flooding and two lanes of 
the harbor freeway was closed during the morning by a mudslide 
a california highway patrol spokesman said debris and trash had 
collected in storm drains because so much time had passed since the 
last storm 
two traffic deaths were blamed on the storm one in an accident 
on the pomona freeway near chino and one on the san diego freeway 
just south of wilmington 
the rain also closed the outdoor renaissance pleasure faire in 
san bernardino 
a weather service spokesman called it an unusually late winter 
storm because of its origin in the gulf of alaska 
though the rainfall set a record for may 28 it was nowhere near 
the record for any day in may that was 202 inches set may 8 
1977 
the wet weather almost spoiled the last day of the memorial day 
weekend 
disneyland knotts berry farm and universal studios reported 
late starts for the rainy monday morning although clearing skies 
salvaged the rest of the days business universal studios had 
fewer than 10 percent of its normal 3000 visitors for the first 
tour said spokesman sean armstrong

demonstrating students and teachers killing a 14yearold student 
on the doorstep of his home witnesses said 
hospitals reported at least three people were seriously wounded 
in the incident which began when police opened fire with tear gas 
to disperse some students and teachers demonstrating for better pay 
and larger student allowances the protesters responded by pelting 
police with stones 
witnesses said the slain student yakuba bah was struck by 
police gunfire while standing at his front door there was no 
immediate comment from officials 
it was unclear what prompted the shooting 
it was the second such clash between teachers and police in a 
week 
on thursday teachers and students rampaged through the city 
fighting with police several teachers were arrested and most 
teachers have refused to return to work since that incident 
the trouble began when police broke up a meeting of teachers who 
wanted to replace their governmentcontrolled union with an 
independent body 
government sources said the administration has increased student 
allowances and was paying overdue student grants the government 
also planned to increase teacher allowances but no details were 
available 
sierra leones government is near bankruptcy and has been forced 
to reduce spending on several occasions teachers and other 
government employees have not been paid on time 
the currency the leone has been frequently devalued and the 
elimination of subsidies for food staples and energy has produced 
soaring inflation prices for many staples have doubled or tripled 
the past two years

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev returns to 
canada on tuesday for a brief visit to the country that introduced 
him to the westernstyle markets he now hopes to install in the 
soviet union 
gorbachev en route to the united states for his second summit 
with president bush is to meet with prime minister brian mulroney 
and canadas governorgeneral during a 29hour stopover in ottawa 
the relatively light schedule should give the soviet leader and 
his wife raisa a day to adapt to the eighthour time change 
before their arrival in washington late wednesday 
the four hours of scheduled talks with mulroney will cover a 
range of issues from the soviets handling of the breakaway 
republic of lithuania to differences over the future status of a 
unified germany officials on both sides say 
canada a member of nato wants the new germany to assume bonns 
seat in the western alliance gorbachev has warned continued german 
participation in nato could slow the soviet military withdrawal 
from east europe particularly in east germany the front line of 
soviet defenses against a european invasion 
canada has a substantial number of lithuanians including some 
active in their homelands independence drive but mulroney must 
tread delicately on that issue or risk a lecture from gorbachev on 
how to handle the equally sticky problem of separatism by the 
frenchspeaking province of quebec 
the conservative prime minister faces the gravest political 
crisis of his 6year tenure as the nation approaches a june 23 
deadline for ratification of the meech lake accord that would 
recognize quebec as a distinct society 
quebec is the only one of canadas 10 provinces never to sign 
the 1982 constitution it has refused to do so unless the nine 
englishspeaking provinces ratify the meech lake agreement 
affording quebec special recognition 
the refusal of three provinces manitoba new brunswick and 
newfoundland to approve the accord has rekindled a quebec 
separatist movement that threatens to split the canadian federation 
gorbachev is to arrive in ottawa at midday tuesday and go 
directly to a private lunch with mulroney at the prime ministers 
official residence later in the afternoon the president is to 
meet governorgeneral ray hnatyshyn the appointed representative 
of queen elizabeth ii 
wednesday is to feature a wreathlaying ceremony at the national 
war memorial followed by another meeting with mulroney a 
lateafternoon luncheon at the national gallery of art and a brief 
press conference with mulroney precede gorbachevs departure for 
washington 
the soviet president first visited canada in 1983 when as the 
youngest member of the communist partys ruling politburo he 
toured the country with a parliamentary delegation 
gorbachev then in charge of the soviet unions agriculture 
program was introduced to western production methods and 
supermarkets brimming with produce 
that visit also provided gorbachev time for extended talks with 
the kremlins ambassador to canada alexander yakovlev who had 
been exiled from the kremlin leadership for his unorthodox views 
after he assumed the leadership of the party in march 1985 
gorbachev brought yakovlev back and elevated him to the politburo 
today the former ambassador is widely regarded as the principal 
architect of gorbachevs reforms 
yakovlev has helped guide the soviet union toward improved 
relations with the west and advocates a marketoriented economy 
which the soviet leadership is hoping to phase in as a replacement 
for the ailing system of central planning blamed for the countrys 
protracted economic crisis

auctioneer al buck buchanan spent 
the weekend selling off half of town and the residents are 
delighted 
it couldnt have gone any better really buchanan said 
sunday of the sale that included about 6 acres 100yearold log 
cabins and antique farm equipment and furnishings 
about 1800 people turned out saturday for the auction ordered 
by the texas historical foundation 
the properties sold once belonged to the late jeanne blocker a 
houston investor and her husband john a former oilman 
mrs blocker had a vision to create a historic village within 
new ulm 
she painstakingly acquired nearly every rundown log structure in 
the area the couple also bought about half the towns acreage and 
several old buildings and brought in buildings and furnishings 
from as far as 50 miles away 
mrs blocker had cleared some land built a pond and small 
waterfall and restored a handful of buildings when the oil bust 
stalled her plans in 1984 
she died in 1988 and her husband donated everything except 
three pieces of land to the texas historical foundation 
mrs blocker worked very hard on all of this said buchanan 
she did an awful lot of research and planning 
but for this town of about 100 what once promised economic boom 
had become a financial drain most of the blockers half of town 
has been tax exempt they bought it as a nonprofit foundation 
meanwhile the steep prices the blockers paid drove up property 
values and taxes for everyone else in town most of whom are 
retirees on fixed incomes 
the take was still being tallied but buchanan said the the 
wellpreserved mackinsky dogtrot log house built in the late 1700s 
or early 1800s fetched the top price more than 6000 
also sold was a creamery a saloon and a ford model t repair 
shop buchanan said some structures will be moved others reopened 
or renovated 
the historical foundation will use the proceeds toward an 
unspecified project elsewhere

sheets covering a patient caught fire during 
surgery monday filling an operating room with smoke so thick that 
staff members couldnt extinguish the flames the patient died 
the sheets just caught on fire its bizarre said fire 
department spokesman pat marek 
investigators were seeking the cause of the fire at the 
sprawling ucla medical center on the campus of the university of 
california los angeles marek said 
an autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death of the 
patient 26yearold angela hernandez who had been undergoing 
surgery for injuries suffered in an automobile accident said 
campus spokeswoman vicki beck 
it was not immediately known if ms hernandez died because of 
the fire and smoke her injuries or a combination of the two 
eight to 10 medical staff members including doctors and nurses 
were performing the surgery when flames engulfed the surgical cloth 
over the patient said ms beck 
there was a serious attempt by the staff to extinguish the 
fire she said 
but the smoke became so bad that the operating room staff 
members had to leave the room and university police arriving at 
the scene could not get inside the room said ms beck 
about five minutes after the fire broke out city firefighters 
arrived but by then the blaze had mostly burned itself out said 
marek 
the fire was just kind of smoldering he said 
the fire was isolated to the operating table and the hospital 
had no structural damage nobody else was injured but the smoke 
forced the closure of all operating rooms for the day so they could 
be sterilized 
it was the second time in 1 years a patient died in an 
operating room blaze in a southern california hospital 
in october 1988 a 15dayold boy was fatally burned at 
cedarssinai medical center when a spark from an electric 
cauterizer used to stop bleeding started a fire that was 
strengthened by a high concentration of oxygen in the room 
ucla medical center officials declined to say if doctors had 
been using a cauterizer monday

emergency meeting with the leaders of sind province and the army 
chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg who cut short a visit to 
bangladesh 
ms bhuttos weak 17monthold government has come under 
increasing pressure from opposition parties to dismiss the 
provincial government of sind headed by her pakistan peoples 
party and declare a state of emergency to curb escalating violence 
members of her party also began demanding action monday after 
sen moshin siddiqui was shot and killed on his way to a hospital 
to visit survivors of sniper attacks sunday that left 40 people 
dead and 75 injured police said 
organized gangs have become the order of the day no road in 
the province is safe and safety of life cannot be assured said 
makhdoom khaleequzzaman who represents ms bhuttos party in the 
national assembly the lawmaking lower house of parliament 
the situation has worsened to the extent that even relatives 
of federal and provincial ministers are not safe they are being 
kidnapped for ransom or they are being killed he said 
besides the 65yearold legislator from the opposition pakistan 
moslem league at least 27 others including three policemen were 
gunned down in random attacks and clashes between rival ethnic 
groups and security forces in karachi pakistans largest city

president saddam hussein opening a twoday 
arab league summit said monday that if israel deployed nuclear or 
chemical weapons against arabs iraq would respond with weapons 
of mass destruction 
also speaking to the 15 kings sheiks and presidents jordans 
king hussein urged arabs to use their oil wealth to influence world 
politics 
the conference was called as a show of arab unity against what 
saddam has said is a western and israeli campaign against iraq the 
summit was also to seek ways to stem the largescale emigration of 
soviet jews to israel 
the potentials of any arab nation have to be in the service of 
all arabs to safeguard national security saddam said 
should israel strike we shall strike back firmly should it 
use weapons of mass destruction we shall use all the weapons of 
mass destruction that are in our possession 
well never give up palestine he added to loud applause 
in a latenight closed session palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat warned that israel was seeking 
to occupy more arab territory to establish greater israel 
from the nile to the euphrates 
he called for a meeting of the defense council of arab league 
defense ministers to map out a joint strategy on the issue within a 
month 
we are dutybound to use all weapons including sanctions 
economic boycotts and political and psychological pressures 
against countries states establishments and companies that 
participate in aggression against arab territory arafat said in 
a speech later distributed to reporters 
saddam did not specify what type of weapons iraq might use 
against the jewish state arabs commonly use the phrase weapons 
of mass destruction to refer to nuclear weapons and more advanced 
chemical weapons 
baghdad has been building an arsenal of longrange missiles 
capable of hitting israel saddam also has said baghdad has stocks 
of binary chemical weapons and in march he threatened to use them 
against israel if attacked 
arabs claim the israelis have 200 nuclear weapons although 
israel denies it 
in jerusalem yossi benaharon a top aide to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said israel was concerned about saddams threats 
he also said iraq recently moved troops into jordan near israels 
border but did not specify how many troops were involved 
in his speech saddam accused the united states of financing and 
encouraging israeli aggression and expansionism 
the united states bears a basic and primary responsibility for 
the policy practiced by the zionist entity against the arabs 
he told arab leaders at baghdads ornate conference center 
arabs say the west and israel have mounted a campaign against 
baghdad following the arrests in england of several people accused 
of trying to smuggle nuclear triggers to iraq several european 
nations also intercepted alleged parts of an iraqi super gun 
saddam has said the developments were designed to justify an 
impending israeli attack on iraqi military or industrial facilities 
similar to the air raid on the osirak nuclear reactor near baghdad 
in 1981 
hussein said arab leaders should use oil as a political tool 
our region contains 65 percent of the oil reserves in the 
world and through the gulf pass 40 percent of oil shipments 
these resources if properly utilized place us among the 
vigorous powers within the movement of history 
but the summit designed to foster unity convened in the shadow 
of a sharp split between prous governments and hardliners over 
a letter to be sent to the superpower summit that begins wednesday 
in washington 
the letter was to address the expected emigration of as many as 
750000 soviet jews to israel over the next few years the arabs 
fear many soviet jews will settle in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
jordan which neighbors the west bank is concerned that 
largescale jewish settlement in the region will drive palestinians 
into jordan and destabilize the kingdom 
and there was disagreement between the hardliners led by saddam 
and the moderates including egypt and saudi arabia over how tough 
a line they should take against the united states 
egyptian president hosni mubarak suggested the summit letter 
to the outside world be humane and rational devoid of 
overstatement and understatement 
the conference was boycotted by syrian president hafez assad 
saddams archrival in the arab world and by president elias hrawi 
of lebanon syrian troops control twothirds of hrawis wartorn 
country 
the opening was delayed by an abortive lastminute attempt by 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi to persuade assad to attend the 
conference in the name of arab unity

a man believed to be scavenging copper wire 
remained in critical condition monday from electrical burns he 
suffered at an amtrak substation where he hung upside down for 
hours as rescuers waited to make sure the power was turned off 
it took several calls from the district of columbia fire 
department before amtrak employees in philadelphia had power to the 
128000 volt substation cut off and more than an hour for an amtrak 
engineering crew to arrive 
in the meantime wendell edmondson 36 was dangling upside down 
from a beam 15 feet off the ground and was naked his clothes 
apparently burned off by the contact with high voltage 
witnesses reported seeing a flash like lightning shortly after 
noticing him inside the station about 930 pm saturday 
one of the fallacies that people operate under is that if they 
dont touch any of the wires then they are relatively safe said 
fire department spokesman ted holmes if you come within a 
certain distance the voltage can arc over to you but they dont 
understand the gravity of that much voltage 
edmondson whose last known address was a homeless shelter was 
listed in critical condition monday in the burn unit of the 
washington hospital center where he was flown after he was freed 
at about 1150 pm saturday 
amtrak spokesman bruce heard said the response to the emergency 
is frankly a pretty good response on a saturday night 
holmes said fire chief ray alfred plans to write amtrak 
officials to determine what went wrong and to establish more 
efficient procedures for the future

more than 200 soviet immigrants arrived 
in israel on monday on a flight financed by christian supporters of 
the jewish state 
representatives of the jerusalembased international christian 
embassy met the immigrants at the bengurion airport near tel aviv 
holding flowers and placards that read operation second exodus 
the immigrants who arrived via hungary were also met by us 
reps william lehman of florida and peter a defazio of oregon who 
are in israel to study resettlement programs for soviet jews 
the two democrats said they would be discussing the issue with 
israeli officials focusing on the settlement of immigrants in the 
occupied territories 
we have been told that more than 99 percent of the refugees 
are choosing to live elsewhere other than in occupied areas but 
this will be discussed in detail when we meet government 
officials defazio told reporters 
the united states and the soviet union strongly object to the 
settlement of soviet immigrants in the west bank and the gaza 
strip areas captured by israel in 1967 the arab countries view 
such resettlement as part of an israeli expansionist plot to drive 
palestinians out 
israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the 
occupied areas although it cannot stop them from choosing to settle 
there only about 200 of the 48000 soviet jews who have arrived 
since 1989 have settled in the occupied territories 
johann luckhoff director of the international christian 
embassy said his group has managed to raise about 150000 to fund 
two flights of soviet jews and intends to continue the campaign 
the group represents christian supporters of israel in more than 70 
countries 
luckhoff said in a statement that we are actually involved in 
saving lives and we are also helping the jewish people fulfill 
their destiny of returning to their roots in the land of israel

against his dictator father the former military commander of sibiu 
garrison testified monday 
the alleged shooting order was not heeded and under 
crossexamination col aurel dragomir acknowledged it would have 
been ignored even if repeated 
an order given by local party organs must be reported through 
levels to our superiors the defense ministry in bucharest and is 
carried out only after their approval he said adding such

trial opening saturday that nicu ceausescu demanded institution of 
a state of war in romania and ordered the shooting of demonstrators 
without warning 
former interior minister tudor postelnicu testified he received 
no word of such a command and said a regional party secretary like 
the defendant was not entitled to order security forces in his area 
to fire on protesters 
such an order should by obligation be reported on a central 
level to the interior ministry but i received no information 
that nicu ordered shooting or no shooting postelnicu testified 
postelnicu was sentenced to life imprisonment for backing the 
elder ceausescus order to fire on demonstrators he was brought 
from aiud prison wearing striped prison garb but not handcuffed 
the charges were based on stenographers notes of a telephone 
conference call dec 17 between nicu ceausescu and local officials 
dragomir 40 said he took part in the conference call and quoted 
nicu ceausescu as saying we are in a state of war and not of 
emergency we shoot without warning

nicu ceausescu telephoned him the evening of dec 17 to make sure 
the army was prepared to start shooting

pheasanthunting party that day where he and his entourage drank 
wine and plum brandy 
after the return to sibiu nicu went straight to the 
conference call stroe told the court dragomir said nicu was 
under the influence of alcohol and he spoke with some difficulty 
but rather coherently 
the revolution began in timisoara dec 17 and spread to other 
transylvanian cities including sibiu and to bucharest

the onceadversarial armies of east germany 
and west germany are establishing ties that include toplevel 
leadership contacts as both nations put the cold war further 
behind them on the way to unification 
for decades the army of west germany a nato member was on 
guard against the troops of east germany a staunch warsaw pact 
member 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg and his east 
german counterpart rainer eppelmann attempted during a news 
conference to calm neighboring countries apprehensions about the 
new cooperation 
the germangerman cooperation in the military sphere must take 
place with careful consideration of the security interests of the 
states of both alliances eppelmann said 
eppelmann who says the warsaw pact is apparently on the verge 
of breaking up said monday a germangerman exchange of soldiers 
during military exercises is not planned 
the east german defense chief said relations are to include the 
adoption and promotion of contacts between the leaderships 
formations and units as well as institutions of both nations 
armed forces 
adn the official east german news agency said the contacts are 
to start on friday 
the two sides also agreed on intensifying cooperation on 
security and disarmament questions 
stoltenberg emphasized what he referred to as the central 
importance of conventional arms talks now under way in vienna 
the soviets have recently balked at signing an agreement that 
would reduce soviet and american soldiers in central europe to 
195000 for each side the agreement would include troops in east 
germany and west germany 
the west german defense chief said that a pullout of all 250000 
us troops in his country was not sensible because of security 
reasons 
there are about 380000 soviet troops in east germany 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has vigorously opposed 
membership in the north atlantic treaty organization for a united 
germany he has vowed to review his military strategy if the 
reunited country insists on such a step 
the west german armed forces total about 480000 personnel 
east germanys armed forces estimated at 135000 have been 
plagued by low morale and desertions

no more turtle soup in mexico as of monday 
no more turtle steaks turtle eggs that locals favor as 
aphrodisiacs or turtle shells for combs computer boards and vanity 
cases 
turtle skin exports to japan for shoes belts and handbags are 
over 
under pressure from environmental groups president carlos 
salinas de gortari signed an executive order declaring an end to 
mexicos turtle industry probably the worlds largest 
until monday the country was the worlds leading exporter of 
turtle products but environmentalists say sea turtles are being 
hunted to extinction here mexico is home to 10 of the worlds 11 
species of sea turtles and nine of them lay eggs and nest on its 
beaches 
salinas signed the ban at a ceremony monday in the capitals 
historic chapultepec castle in the presence of environmentalists 
from the world over governors whose states are involved with 
turtles and fishing industry leaders 
in signing this decree we are taking a definite step to help 
this species continue its biological developments threatened 
with extinction because its natural habitat has been considerably 
reduced salinas said 
the government will close all turtle slaughterhouses and provide 
money to help turtle fishermen and their families diversify 
todd steiner of earth island institute said salinas had received 
more than 70000 letters in six months protesting lack of 
protection for turtles 
steiner said environmentalists talked of declaring a tourism 
boycott on mexico and about 10000 americans signed a petition 
saying they would not visit mexico unless protective laws were 
passed 
environmentalists on monday praised the ban but said the test 
will come in enforcing it they said mexico also must join the 
107nation convention on international trade in endangered species 
of flora and fauna known as cites 
every country in the western hemisphere except mexico has signed 
the accord which bars trade in endangered species mexico is 
japans biggest supplier of turtle skins and japan is the worlds 
biggest importer of turtle products 
japan joined cites but excluded turtle products 
steiner said his organization was happy with mondays ban that 
was aimed at stopping what was the largest killing of an 
endangered species occurring anywhere in the world 
but we will be monitoring the situation closely to make sure 
these wonderful words are fully implemented he said 
michael weber vice president of the center for marine 
conservation in washington said the ban could help the olive 
ridley turtles which nest on the pacific coast recover from 
decades of exploitation 
weber said environmentalists are also urging mexico to require 
use of turtle excluder devices in shrimp nets 
they say its going to end the killing we hope its going to 
end the killing said andrew davis a spokesman for greenpeace 
international 
but he said enforcement could be difficult on the isolated 
remote beaches where turtles lay their eggs 
most eggs are laid on the pacific beaches of the states of 
oaxaca michoacan guererro and jalisco 
last year the government set a quota of 20000 turtles but more 
than 35000 were killed at the stateowned turtle slaughterhouse in 
oaxaca state and 40000 others clandestinely earth island 
institute said 
the biggest slaughter was of pacific olive ridley turtles whose 
skins were sold to japan hawksbill turtles were killed in the 
caribbean for tortoise shell 
the kemps ridley whose population has plunged from 100000 to 
300 in two decades has its main nesting ground at rancho nuevo in 
northeastern tamaulipas state on the gulf of mexico 
because so many were killed much of the meat was wasted 
elisabeth robinson gunther also of earth island said 
protection programs sponsored by ecological organizations and 
the government have been rescuing eggs caring for them until they 
hatch and releasing the young turtles into the sea 
turtle soup eggs and steaks are popular local foods but with 
mondays measure would themselves become banned

about onethird of the schools in 
lebanons battered christian enclave opened on monday for the first 
time in nearly four months in response to a call by the vatican to 
resume classes 
but twothirds of the schools remained closed due to 119 days of 
brutal clashes between rebel gen michel aouns army and militiamen 
loyal to christian warlord samir geagea 
the others remained closed either because they had been 
wrecked by the shelling or their buses burned or their staff had 
fled the enclave to safer areas said a police spokesman who 
could not be named under standing regulations 
the vaticans nuncio in lebanon pablo puente called on 
saturday for the opening of schools after both aoun and geagea 
pledged to him to turn a ceasefire called on may 17 into a 
permanent truce 
at least 1035 people have been killed and 2770 wounded since 
the power struggle between the rival leaders broke out jan 30 
the inconclusive showdown forced about 400000 of the enclaves 
1 million people to seek refuge in safer areas and left large areas 
of the christian enclave in ruins

israels parliament on monday took the first 
step toward legislating direct election of the nations prime 
minister and other electoral reforms 
the knesset approved a preliminary reading of four reform bills 
designed to reduce political horsetrading between parties forming 
government coalitions which one legislator called symbolic of 
israels patchwork democratic process 
i see this day as the first step in healing the system said 
amnon rubinstein leader of the liberal shinui party which drafted 
one of the bills 
the proposals will now be brought to the parliament law 
committee where they will be consolidated into one piece of 
legislation for the second and third knesset readings required for 
the measure to become law 
liberal parties have long sought electoral reforms without 
success but their cause gained momentum recently when the two 
major political forces the labor party and likud bloc raised the 
publics ire by using political posts and public funds to lure 
defectors to cross party lines and to woo religious factions 
ultraorthodox parties which currently hold the balance of 
power between the two largest political blocs opposed the reforms 
as an infringement of their influence 
in separate votes monday the 120seat knesset overwhelmingly 
approved bills submitted by the rightwing likud bloc the 
centerleft labor party the rightwing tzomet and the liberal 
shinui 
the labor proposal got the most votes winning 6033 it calls 
for direct election of the premier as do the other proposals and 
empowers the prime minister to put together a cabinet without 
parliament approval 
under the current system voters choose from a selection of 
national party lists the head of the party that has the most seats 
and is able to form a coalition government has traditionally become 
prime minister 
uriel lynn of likud the law committee chairman said he would 
put together a joint bill within three months

the united states returned part of 
fort amador to panamanian forces on monday after occupying it since 
the december invasion that toppled dictator manuel antonio noriega 
foreign minister julio linares said talks between panama and the 
united states continue on a number of issues stemming from the 
invasion and also said that a plan has been proposed to let us 
coast guard ships operate in panamanian waters if a panamanian 
officer is on board 
linares said he opposes the idea in principle 
if the idea really is to put down the drug traffic it neednt 
be done at the cost of our jurisdiction or national dignity 
linares said 
fort amador on a strip of land at the pacific entrance to the 
panama canal contained noriegas main offices and was occupied 
jointly by american and panamanian forces 
at the transfer ceremony president guillermo endara said the 
panamanian portion of fort amador would be converted to a tourist 
site us forces will remain in the other part 
endara said that on thursday the rio hato military base 70 miles 
southeast of the capital also will revert to panamanian control 
the united states took over key military installations during 
the invasion and has gradually been returning them 
noriegas powerful panama defense forces were disbanded after 
the invasion and are being replaced with a regular police force 
ambassador dean hinton represented the united states at mondays 
ceremony 
the united states invaded dec 20 1989 to capture noriega who 
was sought in the united states on drug trafficking charges 
noriega took refuge in the vatican embassy and surrendered to 
american forces jan 3 he was flown to miami where he faces 
federal drug charges 
linares said panamanian and us officials are continuing their 
talks on usoccupied bases here and on documents captured by 
american forces 
he said the documents are vital to ongoing investigations 
within panama thousands of boxes of documents were captured 
partly in hopes of tracing the cocainerunning operation to which 
noriega is tied

officials on monday began adding up the 
results of the first free elections to local councils since world 
war ii and solidarity claimed decisive victories in warsaw and 
elsewhere 
candidates from more than 80 parties on sunday competed in 
52000 races nationwide a vote that aroused the interest of less 
than half the electorate official results were to be announced 
wednesday 
the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza said preliminary 
tallies indicated candidates of the solidarity citizens committee 
had won big victories nearly everywhere 
unofficial results in warsaw indicated the solidarity trade 
union movement had won 301 of the 341 council seats according to 
halina szymula of the citizens committee in the capital 
but mateusz wyrwich spokesman for the general election 
commission said it was too early to predict the outcome because of 
the complexity of the coalitions and multitude of parties 
former communists appeared to have won seats in the mokotow 
district of warsaw while peasant parties were expected to land 
seats in rural areas 
the vote tally is complicated by the difficulty of identifying 
the political orientation of some parties and groups wyrwich said 
that in central bydgoszcz former communists campaigned as the 
democratic opposition 
the elections were to advance democratic reform by establishing 
independent local governments under four decades of communist 
party rule councils were subordinate politically and financially 
to central authorities 
the voter turnout however was only 42 percent nationwide 
according to the general election commission in last junes 
partially free parliamentary balloting 62 percent of poles voted 
the sweeping victory of solidarity candidates in the june vote 
led to the formation in august of the solidarityled government 
solidarity leader lech walesa joined political commentators 
monday in attributing the lack of enthusiasm to confusion over the 
new political parties many of which have yet to define their 
programs 
theoreticians will say that people are discouraged but i 
think that in such a short time people cannot get reoriented to 
civic activeness walesa said monday 
fewer people at the polls is the expression of a weaker belief 
in the program of democratization and the sense of ones 
participating in it read a frontpage commentary in the gazeta 
wyborcza 
the government daily rzeczpospolita said participation is 
traditionally lower in local elections than in parliamentary or 
presidential ballots but turnout was high in communities where 
local problems aroused voter concern 
the paper also attributed the low turnout to confusion over the 
divisions emerging in solidarity walesa has criticized the pace of 
reform of the government led by prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
the monolothic camp solidarity clearly has split and the 
existing political parties have not managed to persuade voters of 
their program and candidates people dont know exactly whom to 
support the commentary said 
local governments were previously dependent on warsaw for funds 
but under a new system they will receive revenue from state 
businesses that are to be turned over to councils 
parliament is also preparing legislation that would allow local 
governments to set taxes

a new production joins the words of 
allen ginsberg and the music of philip glass to tell a 30year 
story the decline of the american empire 
the hydrogen jukebox which premiered over the weekend at 
the spoleto festival usa is based on ginsbergs poems dating to 
the 1960s 
the poet and the composer along with visual artist jerome 
sirlin began putting the show together in 1989 the festival 
production features six singers and a sixpiece orchestra 
glass said he and ginsberg had discussed collaborating for some 
time but only last year sat down to select poems and compose music 
the hydrogen jukebox is about the decline of the american 
empire ginsberg said in an interview during rehearsals at the 
sottile theater 
each scene is built around a poem the subjects include the 
vietnam war ecology and cocaine trafficking 
its basically an emotional and moral decline ginsberg said 
of the shows theme its not an angry accusation its more of a 
meditation on the decline of an empire the biggest decline of 
empire is we wont face our problems 
glass said most of the 21 poems were written some time ago and 
he was faced with the challenge of finding a doorway into the 
poem 
you can do things with the music that you cant do in the 
poem said glass who collaborated on the epic opera einstein 
on the beach with robert wilson 
for instance one scene has a man sitting on a porch and 
thinking about the vietnam war 
hes thinking about the war and hes also thinking about a 
train glass said you never see the train on the stage but 
there is this rolling bass line which becomes the feeling of the 
train the music becomes the embodiment of one aspect of the poem 
spoleto is billing the production as the premiere of the opera 
version of the hydrogen jukebox the poems and music were 
performed concertstyle earlier this year in philadelphia 
glass said jukebox also will be performed later this year at 
the festival of two worlds in spoleto italy companion to the 
festival here glass and ginsberg have both appeared separately 
at the italian festival this is the first appearance for each at 
the festival here 
the two already were auditioning singers when they were 
contacted about bringing the production here 
we were going to do the piece anyway we were confident we 
could get someone to produce it so we went ahead glass said 
people ask me if i always work on commission and i do but the 
trick is i work on what i want and then i coax somebody into paying 
for it 
asked whether jukebox might appeal primarily to aging 
hippies ginsberg said he saw its audience as teenagers as much 
as anyone its like the show is filling in the gaps in history 
in the last 30 to 40 years 
glass agreed 
were in a festival atmosphere now so this is a little bit 
different but generally speaking this will be a younger 
audience he said

the group earth first has hired a 
private investigator to look into a car bomb explosion in which two 
members were injured and later implicated by police the groups 
cofounder said monday 
the first thing we noticed was that they police were looking 
only for evidence that would show that judi and darryl were guilty 
rather than looking for the people who did it said mike roselle 
cofounder of the radical environmental group 
san francisco bay area private investigator sheila odonnel 
already has begun working with earth first lawyer susan jordan 
roselle said 
judi bari 40 and darryl cherney 33 were booked friday for 
investigation of violation of state explosive laws and each held in 
lieu of 100000 bail the alameda county district attorneys 
office has until 4 pm tuesday to file charges against bari and 
cherney 
a pipe bomb went off in baris station wagon as the two were 
driving through oakland on thursday injuring both the activists 
reportedly were driving to santa cruz to promote a nonviolent 
campaign to halt logging of oldgrowth timber 
earth first is a looseknit group of environmentalists some of 
whom advocate tactics like blockades and treespiking to discourage 
the harvesting of trees 
a roundtheclock vigil held by earth first supporters outside 
oakland police headquarters ended monday after officers emerged at 
5 am and ordered participants to disperse 
none of the protesters was arrested police said they had vowed 
to maintain the vigil until bari and cherney were released 
friends and sympathizers of the two have insisted since the 
blast that bari and cherney were victims not bombers 
several earth first supporters maintained a vigil for bari 
outside highland hospital where she was in serious condition with 
a broken pelvis and other injuries

a judge has renewed hope for spaniards 
awaiting compensation in the 1981 sale of cooking oil that victims 
groups say killed up to 836 people and felled more than 20000 
others 
judge carlos bueren began proceedings monday to subpoena 10 
former public officials accused of negligence for allowing import 
and sale of the rapeseed oil which was meant for industrial use 
the ruling clears the way for a future trial 
the oil was imported from france adulterated and then sold in 
workingclass neighborhoods as cheap olive oil 
bueren ruled friday the spanish state was liable for the former 
officials actions at the time and would have to pay any 
indemnization resulting from a guilty verdict 
the case had been shelved by another judge 
buerens decision came a year after a separate verdict convicted 
13 people none of them government officials on public health and 
fraud charges for importing and selling the oil but acquitted them 
of manslaughter 
the 1989 verdict fixed indemnization payments but those 
convicted claimed insolvency victims groups complained the 
verdict did not guarantee payment

its been eight years since dwayne hardin 
identified the men later convicted of killing two police officers 
but hes still waiting for the 60000 reward 
i didnt receive nothing but thank you adios said 
hardin 34 
when officers william fahey and richard obrien were fatally 
shot feb 9 1982 the then mayor jane byrne offered 50000 for 
information leading to the conviction of whoever was responsible 
the fraternal order of police offered 10000 
hardin who had been driving by the murder scene and stopped to 
help the officers saw two men jump into a car and drive away 
i got out and checked one officer hardin said he looked 
like he was dead the other was trying to get up blood was coming 
out of his mouth and eyes i told him lay down everythings going 
to be all right i reached for the police radio and hollered 
for help 
hardin testified against brothers andrew and jackie wilson at a 
1983 trial and they were convicted 
but the mayor had failed to get any official allocation for the 
50000 she offered and hardin sued said his lawyer hubert 
thompson 
the wilsons convictions were overturned partly because they 
werent allowed separate trials and hardins lawsuit was dismissed 
because the convictions no longer existed 
the wilsons were tried again in 1988 again hardin testified and 
again they were convicted 
he was an excellent witness for us said prosecutor william 
merritt john dineen president of the fraternal order of police 
said 10000 has been set aside for hardin and several other 
witnesses to share 
but he said the reward is based upon a final conviction and the 
wilsons have not exhausted their appeal rights 
dineen said that if the convictions are again reversed the 
reward could jeopardize hardins testimony 
a smart defense lawyer would ask did you get paid to say my 
person committed homicide he said 
andrea brands a spokeswoman for the citys legal department 
said byrnes reward offer is under study 
byrne lost her reelection bid in the 1983 primary

silent march monday night to protest an impasse in negotiations 
over higher wages and other labor demands the employees 
association said 
the association of vatican lay employees said in a statement 
that the protest was intended to point out the lack of response to 
its request for meetings with highranking vatican officials 
this demonstration was aimed especially at obtaining an 
audience with the holy father said the associations president 
mariano cerullo 
he said the association was sure that if such a meeting could be 
arranged the problems could be worked out 
the workers complained they had not received sufficient 
costofliving increases since 1985 that pensions were too low and 
that there was no clear procedure through which they could express 
demands 
the 45minute march went from the workers cafeteria through 
vatican grounds to the san damaso courtyard on the northern side of 
st peters square the association said 
cerullo said 1400 of the approximately 1900 vatican lay 
employees belonged to the association 
in february 1988 hundreds of vatican employees took part in a

a brilliant stylized production of 
oscar wildes play salome is being presented at the spoleto 
festival usa by the gate theater of dublin 
everybody except john the baptist is in white face everybody 
walks in slow motion the costumes are black for herodias white 
for salome black and white gowns for herods female dinner guests 
and tuxedos for men 
in the fourth of 17 performance monday at the dock street 
theater john the baptist sat wearing torn pants on a square at 
stage center presumably at the bottom of a cistern the lighting 
was unusual and imaginative it all worked 
alan stanford entered as herod and in a few sentences 
established his character as a complete hedonist he was large 
soft looking effete and looked like one imagines wilde to have 
looked his voice was plummy sounding rich and dissatisfied from 
this beginning stanford added to his character as the play 
progresses it was an amazing feat of acting 
whether or not wilde intended to make herod the central figure 
in his story of obsession stanford has seen to it that he is 
olwen fouere played salome a spoiled teenager who spits back 
with spite when john the baptist rejects her advances her voice 
was young shes a nymphette for the first time attracted sexually 
to a man whos handsome strong authoritative and probably 
dangerous fouere left it ambiguous as to whether salome knows what 
shes doing 
its her obsession to kiss john the baptist that leads salome to 
dance for herod and then demand john the baptists head her dance 
is little more than turning slowly in a circle and miming a 
striptease 
stanfords herod was superstitious fearing that if he has john 
the baptist beheaded something bad will happen to him his 
description of the jewels he would give salome instead of the head 
is the most sensuous passage in this production 
barbara brennan played a brittle husbandnagging herodias 
wilde has given her most of his few cynical clever lines inserted 
for dramatic relief to frequent comments on the meaning of the 
moons aspect herodias says dryly the moon is like the moon 
steven berkoff directed this salome for the gate theater in 
1988 he later directed the play in london and played herod 
roger doyle played piano on stage almost continually sometimes 
quite loud when john the baptist was shouting from his cistern 
sometimes new age music behind speeches sometimes jazz for dinner 
guests to dance to at one point the gate theater was dancing an 
almostcharleston in charleston 
its interesting that while the spoleto festival worries 
whether the avantgarde musical performance art piece pioneer 
may be found objectionable in 1891 salome encountered a 
british law prohibiting showing biblical characters on stage and 
martha grahams modern dances based on greek legends were once 
considered by some too sensual to be seen 
two of those were on sunday nights martha graham dance company 
program at the gaillard auditorium now theyre clearly seen as 
masterpieces errand into the maze had christine dakin battling 
mario camacho as the creature of fear her fear of her own sexual 
nature terese capucilli danced jocasta and kenneth topping as 
oedipus in night journey in which jocasta has flashbacks of 
life with a husband who was also her son all four danced 
brilliantly 
the company also danced the martha graham work that is a 
favorite with many appalachian spring to aaron copland music 
plus diversion of angels to music by norman dello joio 
audience members reacted as though they had seen a revelation 
miss graham who turned 96 this month smiled broadly while taking 
a curtain call and attended a party afterwards 
spoleto festival usa runs through june 10 and features 110 
performances ranging from high opera to jazz ballet and concerts 
pulitzer prizewinning composer gian carlo menotti founded the 
festival in 1977 and modeled it after his festival of two worlds in

two army officers oversaw the 
removal of log books that might have listed those who left the 
military college the night troops allegedly murdered six jesuits 
the supreme court said monday 
the court cited a report from the usfunded special 
investigative unit the principal agency investigating the predawn 
nov 16 massacre of six jesuit priesteducators their housekeeper 
and her daughter at central american university 
a colonel three lieutenants and five soldiers have been charged 
with murder one of the nine a private is a fugitive 
the court said the log books which registered entrances and 
exits from the school and were considered important evidence were 
removed by order of maj carlos hernandez then assistant director 
of the military college 
lt rene mendoza headed the detail that removed the books and 
then burned them the court said 
president alfredo cristiani in an afternoon news conference 
said the court statement was incorrect in the part referring to 
hernandez 
he said hernandez had ordered the log books be set aside or 
otherwise placed at hand so they could be made available to the 
court handling the jesuit case even so the president agreed 
hernandez should be questioned by the judge about the books 
the investigation into what happened to the log books was 
undertaken at our the presidencys initiative in no way have we 
been trying to cover anything up said cristiani 
mendoza is a defendant col guillermo benavides thendirector 
of the college and hernandez erstwhile boss is the 
highestranking officer charged in the slayings 
ricardo zamora the judge in charge of the jesuit case will 
question both hernandez and mendoza in the coming days the court 
statement said 
a us congressional task force concluded last month that the 
investigation into the jesuits slayings was at a virtual 
standstill the congresssional report cited a lack of 
forthrightness on the part of the military as a major reason for 
the failure to build a case against those accused in the massacre 
the armed forces and rightist deathsquads have usually been 
blamed for the deaths of suspected political opponents in el 
salvador some of whom are believed to be activist priests 
on sunday however a leading international rights organization 
criticized rebel forces for sentencing scores of people to death in 
el salvador saying such acts violate the geneva convention 
americas watch in a 38page document urged the rebels to 
discontinue the death penalty the report summarizes the cases of 
28 people either summarily killed by the left or executed after 
guerrilla trials the past two years 
more than 72000 people most of them civilians have been 
killed in 10 years of civil war between the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front or fmln and a succession of usbacked 
governments 
on sunday jorge melendez el salvadors top rebel leader inside 
the country said the guerrillas want to take part in next years 
elections but that electoral reforms and civil guarantees must

a conservative republican threw a wrench 
monday into his partys plans for challenging democratic gov mario 
cuomo by pledging to run on the conservative party line 
this is a year to attack both the republican and the 
democratic parties said herbert london a new york university 
professor after meeting with likely gop gubernatorial nominee 
pierre rinfret 
london 51 said rinfret 66 offered him the lieutenant 
governors slot on the gop ticket but that he refused 
normally republicans and conservatives agree on a ticket a 
split would only make it easier for cuomo to win an expected bid 
for a third fouryear term 
london said he realized his decision would hurt rinfrets 
chances of beating cuomo 
but i dont think he had a great chance to begin with lets 
be perfectly blunt about it said london adding it was 
unlikely he could beat cuomo running only on the conservative 
line 
london said his candidacy was a way of putting the republican 
party on notice as long as theyre going to use litmus tests 
that rule out conservatives we dont have an alternative 
london has maintained that his conservative views including his 
antiabortion stance were unacceptable to the state gops 
leadership and hurt his chances of gaining their support for his 
gubernatorial candidacy 
rinfret is reported to favor abortion rights as does cuomo 
state gop chairman j patrick barrett said londons decision 
certainly makes our job perhaps more difficult 
but by the same token he added i think we have a superb 
candidate in pierre rinfret and we will still beat mario cuomo it 
was an uphill fight to begin with so whats the difference 
gop leaders had hoped to end an embarrasingly long search for a 
cuomo challenger with a rinfretlondon ticket in place when the 
partys state convention opens tuesday they also hoped such a 
ticket would bring conservative party leaders back into the fold 
but conservatives have objected to rinfret almost from the first 
mention of his name as a potential candidate early last week 
conservative party chairman michael long said he expected to 
announce london as a formal candidate by wednesday 
rinfret has consistently refused to be interviewed

president patricio aylwin summoned former 
military ruler augusto pinochet to the government palace monday 
ordered him to hand over secret police records and told him the 
army must stay out of politics 
pinochet who remains army commander was forced to walk a 
gantlet of demonstrators shouting murderer and other insults 
when his armored car was denied entrance at the palace gate 
visibly furious he complained about the treatment to a police 
guard 
inside he met privately with aylwin and defense minister 
patrico rojas for an hour there was no immediate explanation of 
why palace guards barred pinochets car from entering the gate 
according to a statement issued later by aylwins office the 
president asked pinochet for details on the dissolving of the 
national information center a feared secret police agency that 
functioned during the 16year military rule 
he also ordered that the files gathered during its the 
centers legal existence be put at the governments disposition 
to help prevent and combat terrorism the statement said 
in recent weeks the local press has reported that former secret 
policemen were caught conducting surveillance on officials of the 
new government the center was legally disbanded shortly before 
pinochet handed power over to aylwins elected government in march 
pinochet later called the meeting with aylwin very pleasant 
and added he said he wants the files and i told him we will 
provide all the necessary information 
aylwin also complained about the political connotation of an 
army statement that expressed concern about the creation of a 
special commission to investigate human rights abuse that occurred 
during pinochets rule 
aylwin told him the army had no authority to question the 
panels creation but instead should be trying to cooperate with 
it according to the statement 
pinochet replied he didnt mean to question aylwins authority 
although he had reservations about the investigation the 
presidents statement said he expressed the armys willingness 
to cooperate the statement said 
pinochet left the meeting by a private underground exit 
avoiding reporters he told reporters later however that the army 
statement on the human rights panel was not politically motivated 
aylwin took office march 11 ending the authoritarian rule by 
pinochet who took power in a 1973 coup the rightwing generals 
administration was marked by harsh repression of leftists and 
accusations of systematic rights abuse 
it was the first time aylwin had summoned pinochet to a meeting 
the two men met at the palace three weeks ago at the request of 
pinochet who then complained about the human rights commission 
a clause in the 1980 constitution written by pinochets 
administration allows him to remain army commander until 1998

yugoslavias president warned monday 
that rising nationalism could escalate into civil war but he 
withdrew an earlier threat to impose a state of emergency in 
secessionistminded regions 
borisav jovic a hardline serbian communist who took over the 
collective presidency earlier this month had threatened urgent 
measures to maintain national unity after centerright parties 
won free elections in the northern republics of slovenia and 
croatia 
despite the withdrawal of that threat in a speech to the federal 
parliament jovic insisted on strict adherence to the current 
communist federal constitution 
there is a huge escalation of nationalism and tensions are 
increasing in relations between different nationalities and even 
republics jovic said the process of disintegration is 
spreading and threatens to get out of control 
the new governments in croatia and slovenia seek a much looser 
federal alliance and have threatened to secede altogether if their 
demands are not met 
their deputies angrily refused to vote on jovics proposals for 
easing the interregional strife that threatens to pull apart 
yugoslavias fragile federation 
the deputies argued that they must first clear the proposals 
with the new multiparty legislatures in their republics 
free elections in slovenia and croatia have intensified a 
dispute with serbia the only one of yugoslavias six republics 
that so far has refused to schedule multiparty elections or 
legalize opposition groups 
jovic sounding a note of moderation proposed new talks between 
the presidency and leaders from all yugoslavias regions on a new 
constitution 
the presidency is not considering a state of emergency and is 
not planning to annul the elections in slovenia and croatia 
jovic said 
he also proposed a new law making it possible for republics to 
secede from yugoslavia but warned that constitutional order is 
seriously jeopardized and that yugoslav laws are flagrantly 
violated by some of the 130 largely nationalist parties formed in 
recent months 
not one of them has an allyugoslav orientation he 
complained 
the president contended that unspecified rightwing forces aided 
by foreign powers also not identified could bring the countrys 
ethnic and political tensions to the breaking point 
slovenian deputy janez lukac bitterly criticized jovics 
implication that rightwing forces have taken power in his republic 
and croatia 
i would have expected that the president strive for 
reconciliation instead of the continuation of hostilities he 
said

etched in granite kid of courage tops 
ryan whites gravestone 
the epitaph composed by his mother are three of the more 
modest words that adorn the monument to the indiana youth who 
spent the last five years educating the public about aids 
the words of gov evan bayh singers elton john and michael 
jackson join those of the white family on the headstone that was 
placed monday at ryans gravesite nearly two months after his 
death of complications from acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
no stone covered the grave before monday only flowers and notes 
from thousands of wellwishers and wax from a candle that was lit 
twice each day 
his mother jeanne white spent the time designing the monument 
that was dedicated on memorial day when us servicemen are 
honored for losing their lives in wars ryan was remembered at the 
dedication by friends and family as having fought an equally 
arduous battle 
i think about him everyday several several times his 
uncle tom hale said before about 75 people who attended the 
dedication dont weep for me meet me that would be his 
prayer 
white who contracted aids through blood products he was taking 
for his hemophilia was less than 5 feet tall but his gravestone 
in black and white his favorite colors stands 6 foot 8 inches 
his mother said 
he liked to say he was five foot he always wanted to be tall 
he wanted to be big and be like howie long jeanne white said of 
the defensive lineman for the los angeles raiders 
inscriptions on front and back of the gravestone tell the story 
of his 18 years after a lengthy legal dispute between 1985 and 
1987 ryan won the right to attend school outside of kokomo but 
ugly stares and ill feelings drove him his sister and mother to 
cicero 30 miles north of indianapolis 
in the interim he endeared thousands as a proponent for aids 
education including singers john and jackson words from songs 
performed by both entertainers who remain close to the whites are 
inscribed on the monument 
turn me loose from your hands let me fly to distant lands 
fly away skyline pigeon fly from all the things you left so far 
behind are words on the stone from skyline pigeon that john 
sang at ryans funeral in indianapolis 
gonna make a difference gonna make it right are attributed 
to jackson on the stone 
and from family and friends were sure going to miss you 
ryan 
neighbors and friends offered testimonials about encounters with 
white during the dedication and the choir director of hamilton 
heights high school which ryan attended sang the lords

another spring another summit the similarity 
ends there 
one year ago today president bush was in brussels at a nato 
summit unveiling his proposal for troop and conventional weapons 
in europe and ending a long silence 
he had ordered a review of us foreign policy and put things on 
hold while it was done that left the stage to mikhail s gorbachev 
and gorbachev certainly had used it waging a peace offensive 
and playing to crowds that cheered his visits to western capitals 
now as the ussoviet summit begins on thursday bush holds 
the initiative and gorbachev is a leader with dire problems the 
summit could help him at home 
a year ago the nato summit was a boost for bush after months of 
criticism of his style pace and a lack of proposals while 
gorbachev was waging his peace offensive 
the soviet leader had announced conventional arms reductions 
then proposed negotiations for troop and weapons cuts on both 
sides and later said he would scrap 500 shortrange nuclear 
weapons 
it was the season of gorbymania in western europe and bush had 
offered little to counter it critics said he was timid even when 
he was ready to outline his world view the plans bush described 
were short on drama nothing to rival the gorbachev show 
he proposed an open skies system of arms control 
verification reviving an idea that dates from dwight d 
eisenhower he challenged gorbachev to open the ledgers on 
soviet defense budgets hardly a slogan to rally the western 
alliance 
but that buttoneddown phase ended in brussels bush called for 
cuts to 275000 in us and soviet troop levels in europe with 
ceilings on tanks artillery and combat aircraft too he wanted it 
done about five years faster than gorbachev had proposed 
bush also succeeded in shelving western differences over 
modernizing shortrange nuclear missiles a major issue then now 
overtaken by the collapse of the iron curtain 
parts of the 1989 agenda have been outdated by the remodeling of 
europe the fall of communist governments and the coming 
reunification of germany but the administration still is pressing 
for eastwest cuts in troops and conventional weapons in europe to 
levels that would secure the new look on the continent for all 
that has happened western forces still are outgunned and far 
outnumbered by the soviet troops that remain in eastern europe 
bush said in brussels that he wanted an eastwest treaty within 
a year to be implemented by 1992 or 1993 the timetable already 
has slipped the administration still hopes for a deal before the 
end of 1990 and bush said the process is not going as far or as 
fast as he would like 
bush said he is looking for a way to move those negotiations 
forward its important and i think it does send a bad signal if 
the soviets look like theyre refusing to go forward he said 
thursday 
the stall in conventional arms talks is one of the topics bush 
will raise with gorbachev at their weekend meetings in washington 
and at camp david md that and strategic weapons reductions and 
the soviet economic situation and the crisis over breakaway 
lithuania 
i feel that the man has got some enormous problems hes made 
some enormous progress bush said at a presummit news 
conference i think he knows that were not trying to 
undermine him or make life complicated for him 
to the contrary the administration has a stake in gorbachevs 
success it is important for perestroika to succeed because we 
think that perestroika will bring us a more open and stable and 
secure soviet union and thats very much in the best interests of 
the united states said secretary of state james a baker iii 
i cant tell you whether or not the summit will strengthen 
him domestically in the soviet union 
that yearago summit certainly strengthened bush here we go 
now on the offense he said at the time thats the position he 
is trying to hold as he heads into the meetings with gorbachev and 
with allied leaders a month later

gasoline prices climbed but currency 
devaluation slowed monday after president carlos salinas de gortari 
signed the latest in a series of wageprice control pacts 
salinas signed a new economic growth and stability pact with 
business labor and farm leaders of his institutional revolutionary 
party at a ceremony in the presidential residence sunday night 
this is a renewed effort to fight inflation and consolidate 
the conditions of growth that mexicans demand and deserve 
salinas said 
signers of the new pact agreed not to demand wage or price hikes 
between now and jan 31 1991 when the accord expires 
they also agreed to let the government raise the cost of 
gasoline and continue devaluing currency but at a slower rate than 
before 
gasoline prices were hiked an average 67 percent monday in 
accord with a treasury department announcement that followed the 
signing of the pact 
the pact stipulated that mexican money would be devalued against 
the dollar at a rate of four pesos every five days beginning 
monday the value of currency had been dropping at the rate of one 
peso a day before 
the current rate is 2800 pesos to the dollar 
the business sector promises to absorb these increases 
and not pass them on in costs for goods and services the pact 
stipulates 
an opposition party spokesman criticized the pact because it was 
formulated behind closed doors 
one can make an argument for the prices of gasoline going 
up but its not at all clear why wages arent going up it seems 
to be repeating the situation of having mexican society paying the 
bill for a very unclear strategy democratic revolutionary party 
spokesman ricardo pascoe said in an interview 
the ruling party majority in the lower house of mexicos 
congress defeated a proposal by opposition parties on friday to 
reveal details of the pact before signing it 
the mexican economy has been governed by similar wageprice 
control pacts since 1987 the annual inflation rate has dropped 
from 160 percent to 20 percent during that time 
the pact has had success because the parties to it have 
complied and have had enough flexibility to resolve their 
differences salinas said 
the renewed pact replaces a wageprice control accord signed 
dec 3 that expires on july 31 
following the signing ceremony the government oil monopoly 
petroleos mexicanos known as pemex announced a jump of 35 pesos 
in regular and unleaded gas to 560 pesos a liter in most of the 
country or about 20 cents a liter 
pemex said it would raise the cost of regular gasoline by 65 
pesos in the three largest cities mexico city guadalajara and 
monterrey and along the us border 
the higher price in those areas is designed to earn revenues 
that will be used to improve the quality of gas provide cleaner 
public transportation and fight smog pemex said in a news release

alitalia and usair on monday signed an agreement 
aimed at giving their passengers easier access to each others 
networks 
under the terms of the accord signed in rome passengers of 
italys national flag carrier will be able to fly to 41 us 
destinations by making connections with usair flights leaving from 
boston miami and los angeles 
in turn usair passengers destined for eastern europe or the 
eastern mediterranean can fly alitalia to italy and make the 
appropriate connections in rome or milan 
the accord will go into effect on june 16 
giovanni bisignani managing director of alitalia and randall 
malin vice chairman and executive vice president of usair told a 
news conference that the agreement doesnt call for an exchange of 
shareholdings but they would not rule out an equity swap in the 
future 
alitalia hopes the expanded access to the us destinations 
including such commercial and tourist centers as washington 
philadelphia detroit and san francisco will help it raise its 
market share of traffic between the us and italy 
in 1989 alitalia had 47 percent of that market with 700000 
passengers pan american world airways and trans world airlines 
share the balance 
the accord follows an agreement signed in april between the 
italian and us governments that calls for expanded airline 
service between the two countries under that accord alitalia will 
be allowed to service five us gateway cities and intensify its 
flight schedule while two more us carriers will be allowed to 
fly into italy 
the accord also calls for close cooperation in cargo divisions 
and will allow usair passengers to receive frequent flyer bonus 
points for transatlantic alitalia flights 
usairs only transatlantic routes are to london and beginning 
later this month to frankfurt west germany

the independentminded swedes are 
softening their opposition to joining the european community but 
the question of political union remains a stumbling block 
politicians and analysts said 
prime minister ingvar carlsson in an article published sunday 
said neutral sweden must remain outside the ecs ranks if the 
trading bloc forms a political union 
carlsson said control over foreign policy was the only major 
question barring sweden from ec membership even the dissolution of 
the european power blocs nato and the warsaw pact would not 
persuade sweden to relinquish its neutrality he wrote in the 
dagens nyheter daily 
sweden has relaxed many of the restrictions of its tightly 
controlled economy in the last two years to adapt to european 
conditions major swedish companies also have merged or signed 
cooperation deals with european companies to protect themselves 
when the ec dismantles its internal commercial barriers in 1992 
sweden belongs to the sixnation european free trade 
association which is negotiating for commercial links with the 
12nation ec the package would unite the two into an 18member 
european economic space accord 
but swedish businessmen and the political opposition complain 
that the idea would bind the efta countries to the ec as a junior 
partner with no decisionmaking voice 
an opinion poll conducted by the respected sifo organization 
showed 51 percent of those asked were in favor of seeking ec 
membership compared with 48 percent a year ago 
the poll had a three percent margin of error meaning that the 
change was insignificant but the number of respondents who opposed 
asking for ec membership fell to 21 from 25 percent perhaps 
indicating a trend said sifo analyst alf sjostrom the rest were 
undecided 
we have seen from other polls which we have done that opinion 
in sweden is more positive to the ec said sjostrom 
but the polls also showed that most swedes dont know how ec 
membership would affect them he said 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen speaking in a 
stockholm news conference said sweden should not consider 
neutrality an obstacle to seeking ec membership denmark once an 
efta member is the only scandinavian country in the ec 
i see a common foreign policy where there is consensus 
ellemannjensen said we can work to improve the preconditions 
for reaching consensus 
he cautioned that sweden could not influence ec policy unless it 
were a full member of the trading bloc 
we do not want nonmembers to take part in the decisionmaking 
process it is unthinkable to have farreaching agreemens that 
undermine the ec integrity and process of decisions he said 
swedish opposition leader carl bildt of the moderate party 
also said the policy of neutrality should not be allowed to exclude 
sweden from the ec 
it is impossible to conduct our neutrality policy as if the 
cold war still existed bildt said it is obvious that we would 
participate in the cooperation among europes democracies

canadas varity corp a major farm 
equipment makers wants to move headquarters across the border to 
attract us investors but a canadian official said monday his 
government would sue to block a move 
varity is considering moving its headquarters from toronto to 
buffalo to make its stock more attractive to us investors said a 
company spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity the 
canadian government imposes a 15 percent withholding tax on 
dividends the spokesman said 
a move would make the companys stock available to a number of 
us institutions who may now be precluded from buying foreign 
stocks or may have their fill of foreign stocks the spokesman 
said 
but the move would violate a pledge varity then known as 
masseyferguson made in 1986 in return for a 1691 million 
government bailout said an official of the ontario development 
corp a quasipublic agency that funnels government loans to 
businesses 
varity agreed to maintain or create 1500 jobs in canada by 
1993 and the agreement requires them to keep a headquarters 
here the official said in a telephone interview from toronto he 
said his agencys rules forbid its employees to be named for 
attribution 
the agreement calls for a fine of 25365 for each job varity 
fails to provide but includes no specific penalties for failing to 
keep its headquarters in canada the official said 
tobias levkovich an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp 
co in new york said a move would give varity the visibility that 
its 23 billion in annual sales merits 
this company would be in the fortune 150 if it would be 
americanbased levkovich said now its nothing 
a move also would allow varity to boost its stock price by means 
of a reverse split something that is forbidden by the toronto 
stock exchange levkovich said 
varity recently purchased a mansion in buffalo and won an 115 
million package of tax exemptions from the erie county industrial 
development agency those actions prompted public warnings from 
canadian officials that varity would face a court fight if it moved 
its headquarters 
the ontario official said those warnings still stood but he and 
the varity spokesman said negotiations were under way to find a way 
around the problem 
neither side would say what concessions varity might make in 
return for the governments acquiescence on the move they said the 
negotiations might take the better part of a year to complete 
paul leone business development officer for the erie county 
industrial development agency said varity has about a year to 
take advantage of the agencys incentive package but that there is 
no specific deadline 
the company has estimated it would employ 45 people in buffalo 
within two years if the headquarters are moved the canadian 
government already has claimed varity is 450 jobs short of its 
commitment and has threatened the company with fines but varity 
says it met the commitment by including employees of its us 
subsidiaries who work in canada

people from outside the city were barred from 
shopping in moscows stores today in an effort to stop a wave of 
panic buying caused by government plans to triple bread prices on 
july 1 
president mikhail s gorbachev tried to stem the run on stores 
by making a hastily scheduled appearance on soviet television 
sunday night 
dont panic comrades he told his television audience the 
speech was rebroadcast at midday today 
the mood seemed calmer during the morning at grocery stores on 
taganskaya and dorogmilovskaya streets but the rush resumed 
elsewhere after lunch 
when food store no 30 on gorky street reopened after the midday 
break about 70 people rushed in to buy vietnamese vodka and 
nicaraguan rum nearly overwhelming policemen who were helping 
check for residency permits 
one shopper at tanganskaya where liquor was not being sold 
said the panic seemed to be subsiding 
another woman said gorbachevs speech had a calming effect 
but he really had nothing concrete to offer 
the woman who was traveling with her husband and grandson said 
she told store clerks we were on a trip and needed to get 
something to eat of course they let us in 
she declined to give her name or native city 
a store clerk who initially refused entrance to the travelers 
said how can you turn away a child a person must eat 
a small percentage of those trying to enter the store were 
turned away some of those rejected said they simply forgot to 
carry the residence permits required to live in the city 
in his speech gorbachev said that an anxious mood has arisen 
in the country in connection with the consideration by the supreme 
soviet parliament of the governments report on the transition to 
a market economy 
besides touching off panic buying the reform plan also has 
drawn criticism from such radicals as boris n yeltsin who 
advocate a much more rapid transition to a market economy 
yeltsin opposed by gorbachev was nominated in the third round 
of voting today for president of the russian federation the 
largest of the 15 soviet republics he failed to gain a majority in 
the first two rounds of balloting in the russian congress last week 
yeltsin faces the russian premier alexander vlasov plus ivan 
polozkov the krasnodar party chief and five lesser known figures 
gorbachev in his speech gave assurances that as part of the 
reform plans lower income people would be compensated and that 
those thrown out of work would be retrained for new jobs 
some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people 
could lose their jobs in the reforms which are expected to drive 
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy 
but he said that this transition to a market economy 
cannot be postponed because negative consequences will develop 
ryzhkov presenting the plan thursday said price hikes would 
earn the government an additional 320 billion but that 217 
billion would be paid out to compensate the needy 
gorbachev did not mention the possibility of a referendum as 
discussed by ryzhkovs deputies yuri maslyukov and leonid abalkin 
on wednesday 
ryzhkovs plan calls for bread prices to triple to 109 a loaf 
on july 1 and for other food prices to double on average starting 
jan 1 the average soviet monthy salary is 279 ryzhkov said 
thursday that bread makes up 20 percent of the average soviet diet 
the threephase reform plan to carry through 1995 calls for 
about 60 percent of state enterprises to be sold to the public 
sector and for controls to be lifted on about 60 percent of prices 
other prices would remain under state control and many 
industries would stay in state hands over the opposition of 
radical reformers 
gorbachev said the increase in bread prices was needed because 
the cheapness of bread does not at all correspond to the the amount 
of labor in its production people buy bread and feed it to 
their animals and this at a time when we are forced to buy grain 
abroad 
gorbachev without mentioning names criticized those who were 
skeptical of the government reform program 
they can inflict irreparable damage we must put those 
hecklers in their places they are guided only by their ambitions 
and not the interests of the people gorbachev said

the european communitys executive body 
on monday proposed a titfortat measure that could allow ec 
companies to copy semiconductor designs of us chip makers 
the proposal by the ec commission which must be approved by the 
communitys 12 member nations would drop protection of chip 
designs from nonec countries that do not legally protect designs 
made within the ec 
unlike other nonec countries such as austria japan and sweden 
which recognize and protect designs of chips made in the community 
the united states protects only its own chip designs 
if they wont respect our designs we wont respect theirs 
an ec commission official who asked not to be named said 
what we are looking for is for other countries to recognize 
chips made in the ec and to give them legal protection added the 
official 
currently the ec protects a third countrys chip designs even 
if that country does not protect ec semiconductor designs 
those interim measures will expire on nov 7 the commission on 
monday approved proposals suggesting reciprocal protection be 
extended indefinitely to austria sweden and japan 
but the commission also proposed that chips designed in other 
countries including the united states and switzerland be given 
protection only until the end of 1992 unless those countries take 
action to protect ec designs

and poland swedish trade minister anita gradin said monday 
mrs gradin said the declaration will be presented at an efta 
summit meeting in goteborg on june 14 and will clear the way to

yugoslavia and last april efta approved a 100 million investment 
fund for yugoslavia at favorable terms 
the trade bloc is comprised of sweden switzerland finland 
iceland norway and austria 
mrs gradin said ties with eastern european countries could 
strengthen eftas position in cooperation talks with europes 
dominant trade organization the european community 
some observers have said efta may die out after the ecs 
12member states form a single market in 1992 austria has applied 
to join the ec and public opinion is swinging towards ec 
membership in other efta countries 
but gradin said who knows what will happen in the future efta 
is a useful organization today
